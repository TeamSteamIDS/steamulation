Half-Life 2: Episode One 1 was released a bit over 8 years ago, as the even then long-awaited expansion of the original, critically widely acclaimed game. Since it is part of the Orange Box, the Half-Life 2 Complete Edition and the Valve Complete Edition, chances are great you already own and have played the original Half-Life 2.The good news: Episode 1 continues on the high level of level design and gameplay the original had set. There is however an important shift in focus, as the greater part of the game is played alongside Alyx, Gordon's female companion-in-arms. Alyx happily stands her own against the enemy hordes and doesn't need any sort of ""babysitting"" games wtih less well developed AI sometimes call for. She's been updated graphically as well (looking even better ;-)) since Episode 1 makes use of the High Dynamic Range lighting effects first tried out by Valve in Half-Life 2: Lost Coast. However, compared to that playable tech-demo, environments in Episode 1 are a bit disappointing and don't always offer the best opportunities for the upgraded engine to shine. There are no wide-open vistas, and although the opening level in the Citadel is impressive, it also has a sort of repetitiveness that comes to the fore now and then.On the other hand, gameplay-wise everything is as top-notch as it was in the original game, and the fact that you play alongside Alyx offers some interesting opportunities. There's even a Steam Achievement called ""One Bullet"" which gets unlocked by playing through the entire game (!!) using one single bullet. The rest of the kills/actions has to be made by using the Gravity Gun, which gets an upgrade during the early part of the game. This calls for clever thinking, and I tried to get it, only to find myself missing the shooting action after a couple of hours ;-).All in all, Episode 1 is a good to very good expansion, continuing the story of the original game in a logical and interesting way. There's no reason at all not to give it a shot (...) when you've played the original Half-Life 2.Overall rating: 8/10			"

												Episode One picks up the story right around where Half-Life 2 ended.  Alyx and Dog are looking for you, and your job is to get the hell out of City 17 before it blows up.  There are a few enhancements to the gameplay, some new enemies, and a superb storyline that continues to expand the Half-Life universe.  A must play if you are a fan of the series, or if you're looking for a quick shooter.  The game itself is not long, but packs a punch in the short campaign that you play.			"

												In one way this is the worst of the Half Life franchise, but that said the Half Life series is one of my favourite ones and I still highly recommend this Episode.You got nothing new from the moment you left your Buggy until the end of HL2 in this Episode, so a bit of ""platform strategy"" or vulgo ""recycling"" as we sadly know to well from other sequels, but still enjoyable.There are not many novelties, but the ones like the ""Zombines"" and flares are welcome and add well to the existing HL2 world.Graphics are defo a step forward compared to HL2. As far as the story goes, this is really just a connection between HL2 and Episode 2 and nothing terribly new or exciting will be revealed, but by no means boring.You got a bit of citadel and super gravity gun action, combined with a hint of Ravenholm in the dark, Sandtraps w/o pheromones and lots of City 17. Buy it.			"

												Half Life 2: Episode One is the direct sequel to Half Life 2, but is it worth the name ?Half Life 2: Episode One begins as soon as Half Life 2 ends. We find ourselves in a bad place as the citadel is about to be destroyed and it's gonna take the entire city with it, so you need to escape before the city is destroyed. This review will be incredibly short since this is pretty much Half Life 2, I'll just cover the cons and pros of the game.I want to say this was a bit disappointing playing this episode. Apart from the final mission, the entire game is kind of boring. The gameplay is the same thing as in Half Life 2. There's no change whatsoever. There's nothing really new here it's basically the same game as Half Life 2.The story is still great. But I think the events leading into what is Episode Two are far more interesting than the entire story of episode one.My biggest problem with this game is probably the story. The game is kind of slow in pacing and it's a drag and not to mention it's also incredibly short. It took me 2 hours to finish the entire game. There's pretty much no replay value after that. Overall my feelings towards this episode are still positive. This is as good as the previous Half Life titles, just the story is kind of boring, but apart from that it's a great game.Final Rating:7/10 - Play itIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked the review post in the comments on what you disliked.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												If you enjoyed half life 2 you will enjoy this. While the first, second and fifth final chapters are abit lackluster and shallow the game is essentially more half life 2. Its enjoyabile, its cheap its short and continues the half life 2 story. While not as good as half life 2 it has all the action, variety and cleverness of the original.			"

												Half Life 2: Episode One continues after the events of Half Life 2. While no doubt it is fun and immersive, and let's be honest Co-oping along side Alex.....finally is out right fun. There is nothing really all that new from the first. It is shorter obviously than Half Life 2 and even Half life 2: Episode 2. In my opinion is the weakest of the series so far. It has the same enviroment only this time after the events of the destruction of the Citadel and how the city is hoping with the aftermath. If your a Half Life fan, you need to get this! I had so much fun tagging along side Alex through the entirety of the game. The only real negative I would give is that it's much shorter than Half Life 2 and Episode 2. Don't let that though be the deciding factor of whether or not you make the purchase. Trust me, it's very much worth it!			"

												Well, First of all, I am very surprised that you are  actually  going to read a review to buy this awesome Game. I bet you already know this is an installement for the Ledgendary game 'Half Life 2' So why bother reading a review? But if you still want to continue reading, Then be my guest. Back to the review. This is an AWESOME Game for a Game that has been released in the Year 2006 (June 1, 2006 to be precise, Oh, And By The Way, My Birthday is on June 29th!)  And yet, It still is. If you have Half Life 2 and dont have EP1, Trust me you are missing alot then.  It is a hard Game, Especially because of the dark areas which happened to be filled with Zombies and God, (Or should I say Gordon? :P) knows what else.  There are no new Weapons, But hey now, Who needs new Weapons when there are already plenty to choose from? The Game is a bit short, But reasonable, But the Story is mind blowing. I wont tell what happens in the story, As I might accidently tell something that I'm not supposed to. Overall, I highly recommend this Game, Infact, The whole series to any Gamer. It doesnt matter whether you are a Beginner, Intermediate or an Advanced Player, You will find this game very interesting to Play.			"

												This is a good game for those looking for an extension to the Half Life 2 franchise. It doesn't feel like a crap dlc that's been rushed to simply bring the company in some extra cash. The game has had a considerable amount of thought put into it and it still feels like Half Life. It took me roughly 4 hours to complete this as there are some very challenging parts to this game and sometimes you just don't see what's in plain sight. Would recommend this game and looking forward to playing Episode 2.			"

												Первый эпизод Half-Life 2 это практически идеальный аддон для шедевральной игры, в котором минимум инноваций соседничает со все тем же восхитительным геймплеем. Не зря многие считают первый эпизод отдельной игрой. Усилий разработчики вложили по максимуму и у них снова, в 2006 году получилось навести улыбку на лица всех фанатов серии. Всего один новый враг и одна новая технология HDR в первом эпизоде послужили отличным примером того, что когда талантливые люди делают с душой свое дело, у них все получается на все 100! Безупречный аддон и маст хев всем фанатам и просто любителям хороших игр.Оценка 8,8/10			"

You get the entire series plus Portal 1, and it comes out cheaper. The Orange Bundle was on sale yesterday for $5 on greenmangaming. Its normally 20 dollars however, which is still a pretty good deal. I think i bought it for $10. so yeah, the bundle can save you some money if you place it on your wishlist and buy it on sale.			"

Unfortunately, they cannot escape before the Citadel's core detonates. So Alex and Gordon are forced to enter the Citadel to stabilize the core long enough for them to safely escape.

Gameplay: There are only two changes to the core game: First, Alex's AI has been dramatically improved, so she is more helpful and not nearly as annoying as most NPC's that simply repeat the same phrases and actions. Second, you start the game with the Gravity Gun, which is utilized both in combat and puzzle solutions.

Achievements: There are 13 achievements in Half-Life 2: Episode One. Five achievements are unlocked by just completing the game, the rest are achieved by special circumstances. (like... “beating the game firing exactly one bullet”, “not killing any stalkers”, or “killing an elite soldier with his own energy ball”)To be honest, these achievements aren't very bad, this was a relatively easy 100% completed game, compared to others games.Price: Half-Life 2: Episode One, is priced at $7.99, unfortunately the game is very short, and this price is a bit high for the amount of time it will take to play through the game. (You will probably spend about 5 or 6 hours to beat it)A far better alternative, is to purchase The Orange Box for $19.99, you will purchase: Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode one, Half Life 2: Episode Two, and Portal.Conclusion: Story: Still very good, but unfortunately much shorter then Half-Life 2. Gameplay: Pretty much the same as Half-Life 2, the only difference is you use the Gravity gun much more, and much sooner. Achievements: Straightforward, fairly obtainable 100% completed game. Price: Over priced, wait for a sale, or purchase the Orange Box for the best value.I recommend this game to anyone who played Half-Life 2 and wants to continue the story of the Freeman...Related reviewsHere's the URL to see my review for  Half-Life 2Here's the URL to see my review for  Half-Life 2: Episode TwoHere's the URL to see my review for Half-Life 3 ...(...is what I would say if it was released yet *sob*) "

												Half-Life 2: Episode One begine right where Half-Life 2 ended, and continues the story of Dr.Gordon Freeman in City 17, however, this time, the priority remains to escape the city following the events of Half-Life 2.With updated lighting and AI for deuteragonist Alyx Vance, and expanded usage for the Gravity Gun, Half-Life 2: Episode One continues Half-Life 2's usage of advanced graphics, physics, music and writing to create a game that is both rich in gameplay, plot, and emotion. Like its predecessor, it uses training techniques to allow for a more fluid experience, and utilizes the game's physics engine to a full. With excellent performances by its cast, it's able to greatly explain the story of Gordon and Alyx escaping City 17.With an excellent soundtrack composed by Kelly Bailey, the game becomes even more action packed, and the act of blasting zombies in an infected hospital with a shotgun becomes far more enjoyable, and the scene of fighting infected Combine soldiers in the underground becomes more threatening.The game also includes Developer commentary in the form of a commentary mode that allows the players to listen to the developers' thoughts on everything from map design to character and scene writing, and includes all variant of Valve Employee sharing their thoughts on the game.If I had to say I had any issues with the game, I'd have to say that it's fairly short, while Half-Life 2 is around 12-15 hours long, Episode One is around 5 hours long. That's not to say it's a bad game for that, though, as the story and game runs at a certain pace that allows for it to be enjoyed to the fullest; Replaying the game with the knowledge of how short it is doesn't damage or reduce the enjoyment of playing it, as Valve injects a great deal of fun into the game so there aren't many moments or time that is wasted, and every minute is used to its fullest.If you enjoyed Half-Life 2, and want more, I greatly suggest you buy the Half-Life Complete Steam bundle, preferably during a Steam Seasonal Sale. The bundle consists of this game and every other Valve-released Half-Life title, and is an essential for a fan of Half-Life.			"

Milestones In Gaming Never Get OldThere is not a lot left to say about HL2. We all agree that it lifted the genre to the next the level. I have to confess however that I haven't played HL2 Episode One at all during the last 9 years and that I did not even touch it during the last 4 years that I have it in my library.  THIS WAS A GREAT MISTAKE AND I REGRET ITThis 9 year old Stand-Alone Expansion of HL2 is perfect: story, characters, puzzles, innovation, action, design and even the graphics are still on a very high level and way ahead of some newer games. And it runs like butter...New features like VR or 3D Vision lift HL2 in general into the new age of virtual reality, of gaming. I played it with 3D vision and had a great blast wandering through City 17, the Citadel. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! If you have it in your library since a long time, but never touched it, never installed it - like I did. Do not wait any longer. 9 years have been enough. GREAT GAME. "

												Half-Life 2: Episode One is a first-person shooter game from Valve. It is a sequel to the previous game, Half-Life 2.Half-Life 2: Episode One continues Gordon Freeman story from Half-Life 2 following the destruction of the Combine Citadel Dark Fusion reactor. In this episode you have to buy the resistance and yourself more time to escape City 17 and then escape with them, but it's not going to be a short one. I recommend this.Half-Life 2: Episode One also focuses on AI companion. Alyx will accompany you 80% of the time and she is very helpful. But you also need to help her help you in some level.Rating 10/10			"

												Gameplay wise - it has some great moments; including a standout section in which the player directs Alyx Vance's fire via a flashlight.Unfortunately Valve  became sloppy with this expansion pack - opening with a deus ex machina in the lazyest manner poosible. The scripted sequences become contrived ""look at this"" moments with Alyx Vance spelling everything out for the player or repeating ""oh my god""  or in general, gasping at anything and everything to give a foiced sense of drama. Basically - it's more Halflife 2, but not as good. It's still a great - great game. Better than 90% of shooters out there, but pales in comparison to the main game. Would still recommend it.			"

												This is the continuation of the story from the end of Half-Life 2.This is the classic Valve first person shooter single person campaign. If you buy one game on Steam, this and the Half Life 2 episodes should be it.The classic story of Gordon Freeman. Exploreable environments and useable / moveable objects, voiceover actors with alternate conversations. Is linear but you can explore alittle of each map. Autosave works good.  Has a great story.

+ This is essentially a stand-alone expansion to Half-Life 2 that starts off at the same moment that Half-Life 2 ended. This is great for those who have already finished Half-Life 2 and want more content.+ Same great gameplay as Half-Life 2, same weapons, nothing dramatically new + Expands on the story, answers some questions, while leaving you still wanting more by the end.+ You get to get closer to Stalkers (the creepy looking abominations that you see working at the end of Half-Life 2), and find out what they actually are.- Fairly short in length. Roughly 2.5 to 3 hours long~ If you have NOT played Half-Life 2, do NOT play this game first. I'm not really sure why this is a stand-alone game			"

												Half-Life 2: Episode One is science fiction first person shooter game developed by Valve Software on the Source Engine. It tells the continued story of physicist-gone-action-hero Gordon Freeman as he and action-hero-gone-love-interest Alyx Vance escape from the physically unstable City 17 before it blows up I think.In my review of Half-Life 2 I definitely wasn't very nice to the game. I said the game was unfocused and average, with interesting ideas and clever storytelling but drawn-out setpeices and a largely uninteresting plot if you remove all that glittery facial animation. Some of that, I think, is still justified but one thing I forgot to mention was how much I actually really like Half-Life 2.One thing the HL franchise enjoys doing is pulling the rug out from under the player and then throwing a bunch of enemies at them. That's pretty cool but it's also sort of troubling, considering that most of Half-Life 2 feels very aimless as if Gordon is just drunkenly stumbling between ambushes and set-peices. Episode 1 seemingly tries to fix that by making whatever the current goal is very obvious, either with some kind of environmental clue or with Alyx directly telling you what the objective is:Escape the towerGet to the train stationThe story is more grounded and because of that the gameplay can throw you into as many accidental circumstances and detours as it wants because you always end up back on track. I also appreciate how the stakes are a lot higher feeling in this game. It isn't just a vague intergalactic business proposition between Breen and some alien terrorist people, the actual city feels like it's about to blow up and if you keep getting interrupted by the combine than everybody involved will actually die. And it isn't just your life that's at stake here, you spend the entire game fighting alongside Alyx Vance, which sounds like a bad idea but this game manages a sidekick-idea very well.Anybody who played the first game remembers the third act where you command a squad consisting of that guy who sounds like everyone else and a girl who only occasionally dreams of cheese(?) but nobody WANTS to remember that part because not only is it sandwiched between the two best parts of the game but it also is un-doubtably the worst. The AI blocks the player at every turn and is super reliant on Gordon; they will not go anywhere unless you ask them too and they die as quickly as your enemies do so they may as well not be there--heck the game is more fun when they AREN'T there.The squad idea comes back in Episode 1 but not only are they more resistant, they seemingly abandon the whole ""Targeting"" thing--they seem to go wherever they want until you start to progress, and most importantly they stay out of the players way. All of this culminates into Alyx who not only follows the player from the very start but is INVULNERABLE to damage. This could make her too powerful but the devs fix that only giving her a pistol until about halfway through, and even before that she's a very good aim. Most of the opening is spent with the player under a variety of handicaps such as only having a gravity gun or not having a ton of ammo and the devs cleverly use Alyx as your second half, which not only ties their mostly plot-based comradery into the gameplay but also makes you feel like a real team by the end.Ultimately I think Episode 1 expands on HL2 and makes the game better. There's only one new enemy and a smaller arsenal than before but the gameplay is tightened and the story in more investing. I'll be the first to admit that my review of HL2 was a bit hyperbolic but I still recommended that game and I absolutely recommend Episode 1 as well			"

												Let's be honest. Episode One is very short compared to Half Life 2, but it has a greater frequency of action events and happenings. I really like the speed it starts with and they keep it until the ""end"". Solve puzzles. Let the woman grab a gun and take care of the killing part of the game for you.

												Half-Life 2: Episode One continues the story of Half-Life 2 with another adventure of Gordon Freeman and Alyx. The story picks up right away after the original game and offers more of the same as the original. There's nothing really new to note here besides some new enemies and a level that puts good use of the flashlight; you also have Alyx by your side the entire time - which allows for some unique gameplay, such as not firing any bullets and only using the gravity gun. Episode One is somewhat short, I was able to complete the game in ~3 hours.			"

												This game is AWESOME!!! It has AMAZING graphics, NEW ENEMIES for you to kill and the classic ones of course, it's a VALVE game which makes it a OUTSTANDING game, it has NEW ENVIRONMENTS (kinda) and last but not least Alyx is helpful for the first time in a Half-Life game as she helps you to destroy tons of enemies, even though she can die now(in a mission or in one chapter at least) apart from opening doors, keeping you company and talking to you all the time. In my opinion this is an AMAZING expansion to the Half-Life 2 game and if you own Half-Life 2 then you must play it!! P.S Alyx may be sarcastic during the game and a bit annoying when she's standing in front of you but hey she's a programmed NPC and I like her anyway.			"

												The aftermath of Half Life 2. This game is well worth $8, although there isn’t much replay value and it’s not very long, the game play itself is amazing enough. Fight the newly introduced combine zombies as well as old enemies from Half Life 2 such as stalkers and gunships. Amazing storyline the only downside to this game is that it’s too short but it’s still worth the moneys. Buy it on sale or in the Orange box which includes other Valve favourites 8.5/10 too short for a stand alone but amazing all together			"

												I would call this game descent. It's great to see the story carry on, but there is not much new additions to this game except for the zombines. If you're a fan of Half-Life, you'll love this game, like me. For me this game is just an adventure going all the way back through everywhere again to get to the train station. It just feels like I'm going around the otherside of the buildings from Half-Life 2 and after a while that would start to get repetetive. But the reason why some people like me like this game is because it's like you're still not finished with Half-Life 2 and you want to how the story unfolds. I totally understand why people don't like this game in the Half-Life series. I think that the true fans of Half-Life will enjoy this game. Personally I recommend it. Play it if you love Half-Life, if you don't I don't know...			"

												A nice continuation of the Half-Life series and introductions of new gameplay and content. You spend more time with Alyx, whether that's a good thing or not is subjective, but I personally like how they built her character. It also includes the commentary system Valve has been putting in their games ever since Lost Coast which gives cool insights in the development of the game. It gives more than just the satisfaction of knowing what happens after Half-Life 2, it really is worth buying just for the new gameplay as well.			"

If you want to know what I thought of HL2 I refer the reader to that review. Suffice it to say I loved it and Episode 1, although not as memorable as its predecessor, is still enormous fun to play.

												Half-Life 2 Episode One is the continuation of the Half-Life saga or rather the story of how Gordon Freeman saved the world. While I was a big fan of the single-player campaign in the original Half-Life these new stories that have been unveiling beginning with with Half-Life 2 just haven't been quite as impressive and Episode One feels much the same way.The story picks up shortly after the end of Half-Life 2 proper. Through the power of being the protagonist you have somehow manged to survive and must now fight your way out of the city before it implodes on you. There is not much new to the storyline or gameplay and the areas feel like they could have been ripped straight out of the regular Half-Life 2 campaign.Of course there is a certain bias from me because I never bought Half-Life 2 to play Half-Life 2, that was just a nice little bonus, I bought it for the mods and as such I am not nearly as invested as others in the lives of Alyx and her boytoy Gordon.Get it if you liked the single-player campaign in Half-Life 2 and want a few more hours of it. Otherwise you can safely ignore it as it's an entirely forgettable expansion.			"

Over the course of it, you acquire all needed weapons to complete it. You will still fight ships and striders though. Puzzles are pretty much what you would expect from a Half-Life installation. Whole game can be completed using only the gravity gun, because you are always with Alyx and she's able to do the shooting instead of you.Nothing new is added, except maybe a new zombie, no weapons, no vehicles, but it doesn't really matter, because continuing the story is more important. If you liked Half-Life 2, then you should also probably buy Episode 1.			"

												The Half-Life 2 episodes were meant to be a foray into a new method of game development. Instead of spending several more years making Half-Life 3, Valve would release smaller iterations over shorter spans of time, which would also let them refine their work as they went. Coming out two years after HL2, Episode One was a relatively understated success, with improvements made in AI and the Source engine taking the technical spotlight.It's not nearly as long, dealing primarily with the aftermath of HL2's finale, but in the process avoids the drag that game sometimes suffered from. There's a decent variety here: the first third of the game only gives you one weapon to work with (albeit a powerful one), the second third is almost survival horror, and the final third is a roaring return to Combine-destroying action.You're partnered the entire time with Alyx Vance, who is thankfully more helpful and humorous here than annoying, and it's with that you realize that Valve also meant Episode One to be an exercise in character development that did more than just have you stand around for 5 minutes every time an NPC opens their mouth. The game is largely a success in that department too, and Valve's signature stealth brilliance in writing manages to make her not only cool, but human.If you're reading this, you probably already own it, but if you don't (or do and haven't played it for some reason) and were a fan of Half-Life 2, I'd say go for it. At the very least, it's a good bookend between its predecessor and its more outstanding sequel, Episode Two.			"

Half-Life 2: Episode OnePositives• Beautifully put together story• Story progression is well paced and exciting• Characters do not feel static• Graphics are still good even for today's standards• Organized and reasonable achievements for the most part• Simplistic and engaging combat• Well put together environment and futuristic theme• Music fits right into the storyNegatives• AI is a little outdated • Many times I did not know where to go or what to do• Quite a few times the game left me stuck where I had to restart a segment• Story still has holes by the end hopefully filled in by Episode 2• The ""One Free Bullet"" achievement is very frustrating where I had to replay half the game to get• Puzzles can be annoying at times• Physics are inconsistent sometimes• Ends in yet another cliff hangerFinal Thoughts: Episode One wraps up quite similar to the previous game with a cliff hanger where you do not know if Gordon survived or not. It also starts with holes not filled and hopefully is filled in by Episode 2. The story is very well crafted but this episode does not do much in the way of the story it just continues the last game. Although there was a few problems with segments not working and the ""One Free Bullet"" achievement being a hassle, the game is definitely worth your time.Rating: 8.0/10-Penta "

												Half-Life 2: Episode One is the continuation of the amazing game Half-Life 2. Starting as soon as you left from Half-Life 2, the game does the same magic. A constant action, yet, shorter version of Half-Life 2 starts off with a new objective in a new area in order to move from place to place in the Half-Life universe. No doubt, still just as great as Half-Life 2 as far as graphics, gameplay, physics, and storyline take you.			"

												I bought this game years ago simply to see the ending to the cliffhanger that Half Life 2 provided. And I utterly hated this game, at the time I thought everything was poorly designed with my main complaint being the lack of ammo and weapons for the amount of enemies you have to kill. I considered it one of the worst game I ever played and it turned me off of Half life so much that I didn't bother buying the 2nd episode. I still haven't played it and I'm planning on buying it tomorrow during the Holiday Sale.But after completing Half life 2 with some mods I decided to install episode one again and take it for a spin, fully expecting to hate it again. I was pleasantly surprised though Episode one is still the weakest game in the Half Life Franchise. First off my initial complaint of the lack of ammo for your weapons just... isn't a thing anymore. Maybe I just sucked and wasted too much ammo but I never had a problem. Though I wish that the crowbar was given to the player in the beginning of the game, instead of the half-way point where you no longer need it. Having a viable melee weapon early on in the game against the headcrab zombies would have been really nice instead of having to constantly run around the map looking for cement blocks to shoot at them with your Grav Gun.Also the game is really dark, this in of itself isn't an issue but due to the fact that your flashlight uses energy you basically have to stop and stand still in the dark for a few moments while your flashlight charges, which really kills the game flow for me. I wish they just made the Flashlight not use your suit's battery so it could stay on indefinitely.I also really liked the Zombine enemy. They become a priority when dealing with hordes of Zombies and they can be actually quite helpful for you when they pull out a grenade and go kamikaze. If you're quick enough to get away they can  usually kill the horde of zombies for you. You can also shoot the grenade out of their hand or snatch it from them with the Grav Gun. It's all these things that makes them a fun dynamic new enemy which makes up for the lack of new weapons or features.There are also a lot of great gunfights with the Combine and the firefight in the Hospital is definitely the best part of Episode one. Also Alyx is a treat too though I found her animation to be a little stiff and lifeless at times. Beat the game and when you're on the train, just look at Alyx and you'll see what I mean. She looks like a Mannequin at points and for a game whose main selling point is having Alyx fighting with you it seems like a big oversight, especially since the source engine has proven before that its quite good at making life-like animations. But the biggest problem I have with the game is that it is waaay too short. I have around 6.9 hours clocked in and thats after 2 playthroughs. I believe my first playthrough took me about four hours and my last playthough just shy of three. Even in a market in which single player campaigns are getting increasingly short, there is no excuse for Episode one to be this short and it is simply not worth the asking price of $8, even when you take mods like MINERVA into consideration.Ultimately I would recommend Episode One but with a big asterisk: Do not pay full price for it and understand that it is the weakest game in the Half Life Series, even a game like Blue Shift I feel is better than Episode one. But it has some cool gunfights and helps to continue the story and transition into Episode two. Pay at most $4 and make sure you play the Minerva mod at some point to get your full money's worth.

 Half-Life 2: Episode 1 After the success of HL2, Valve made the design decision to release its sequels as episodic titles. This allowed them to capitalise more efficiently on rapidly improving graphical technology and dispense their content a lot faster. Released in 2006, Episode 1 is the direct continuation of HL2 which charts Gordon and Alyx’s treacherous escape from City 17. Technically, it attempts to improve and advance every aspect that its predecessor established.The gameplay of Episode 1 is based almost entirely around the concept of you working in partnership with your AI companion, Alyx. This mainly involves Alyx following your lead and helping you during combat, but there are also several innovative sections which reinforce the idea of teamwork. These include a dimly lit area where you need to use your flashlight to illuminate enemies for Alyx to shoot; and a section where you need to clear Alyx’s line of sight while she supports you from afar with a sniper rifle.She has been programmed to act as a support role, remaining reticent during puzzle sections and hanging back during ‘boss’ encounters. This feels like a well-balanced design choice as it allows the player the freedom to advance at their own pace and feel more of a sense of accomplishment at overcoming challenges.The AI has seen significant improvements, especially in path finding abilities. Alyx in particular has had a substantial upgrade, giving her new animations for crouching and synchronised kill moves for a lot of enemy types. Enemy AI has also seen developments as Combine soldiers can now crouch and take cover more effectively. They have also been given a rope repelling animation which always looks visually engaging. The only new enemy type introduced is the Combine zombie, or ‘zombine’. They are an entertaining addition that adds a new threat to the undead portions of the game.The puzzle sections are still relatively easy and should not take anyone too long to solve. Despite this, they are slightly more diverse than the simple physics based puzzles of the original game and still serve as an effective diversion from the combat scenes.Graphically, Episode 1 has seen some major upgrades. Valve has adapted their Source engine to include new developments in HDR (High Dynamic Range) lighting, which was originally showcased in their Lost Coast tech demo. This really helps to elevate the presentation to a high standard; for example the shader effects used around the Citadel core still manage to impress me today. There have also been further advancements in facial expression modelling which helps bring some more personality to the main characters.Overall, Episode 1 is a solid entry into the HL2 series. The main criticism that can be presented is its length; it is only five chapters long and can be comfortably completed in less than 10 hours. However, it is worth mentioning that there is also a developer commentary mode which provides some insightful observations if you are at all interested in the design process, or if you simply want to get a little more replay value.Personally I feel that Episode 1 provides the least story enhancement of the series, which can make it feel more inconsequential. However, from a technical stand point it does improve on almost every aspect in terms of gameplay and graphical experience, and is a well-polished presentation that serves as a good stepping stone into Episode 2.

												Not my favorite episode but still, getting the Gravity Gun in the Citadel is still worthy and because you're a lucky dog with Alyx next to you.In reality, the ending of Half-Life 2 is kinda tweaked. G-Man was putting you back to your lethargy when Vortigaunts appeared and saved you from this fate. Now in a City 17 in ruins, you have to go back inside the Citadel to buy time for the evacuation of civilians, though Combines are still fighting till the end.It's not my favorite episode because there is nothing new and that we already saw City 17 or the Citadel. It's just that I wanted a change of scenery, like Episode 2 proposed. But Alyx is now really at your side every step of the way, which is also a good change.The new enemy here is the Zombine: a soldier from the Combine being affected by an Headcrab and which often is carrying a grenade. I don't count Stalkers here as they're victims first and that they're not trying to kill you, they're just following a pattern with the laser.Also, the real intense moment is probably the train station: whether it's escorting civilians to safety or deal with the Striders to make sure the last train can depart (and it's yours, so...).The real challenge was added in 2010, with the achievement asking you for using only one bullet (and that bullet is necessary because without it, you can't advance in the game).In other words, missing Episode 1 can't be possible for the sake of the story and the plot, otherwise, for me, it's not a memorable one. Episode 2 was better as Half-Life 2.			"

												I can now understand why Alyx Vance has been hyped up as a great partner over the years. I didn't get the feeling of her having much of an influence in the base game of Half-Life 2, but in Episode One she really shined while saving Gordon's bacon repeatedly. The entire game sends dedicated to showcasing her as a strong partner, the likes of which has only really been rivaled by Elizabeth from Bioshock Infinite in recent years.The gameplay continues to be innovative, mostly by expanding what the NPCs can do, like having Alyx gun down everything in sight with a pistol, sniper rifle, or shotgun. It's a fun little continuation of the main game, although I can't say that it adds much to the story, which will hopefully be revealed in the second episode.			"

												This is the epilogue to Half-Life 2, and it plays well.  You can see the Portal-like thinking in the design, especially at the beginning areas, which are a bit puzzle-based rather than combat heavy.  The difference is rather than using a portal device, you are using the gravity gun.  You don't even start with a crowbar.  Of course, this is just while the game prepares to return to form.  By the time it's over, you'll be back with crowbar in hand and a full array of weapons.  As well as the return of Gordon's followers.The game emphasizes the follower/NPC mechanics, as not only will Gordon have NPC followers helping him through parts of the game, but Alyx follows him for most of the game.  Rather than being a burden to be protected like too many escorts, however, Alyx is an active combatant, and more than holds her own.  You'll be glad she's there to draw fire and take down enemies at your side, and you'll notice the few times when she's pulled away to perform a background task and you have to go it solo.  It is a little abrupt, but it is worthy appendix to Half-Life 2's gameplay and storyline.			"

OverviewAfter the major success that Half-Life 2 was, many fans of the series were left wondering when the next installment of the Half-Life franchise would come out. It came as a shock when Valve announced that they would begin releasing episodic installments in their best selling franchise.Half-Life 2 Episode 1 is a continuation of Half-Life 2, picking up right where the last game ended instead of starting somewhere completely new. This may confuse many new players who haven't played the original hl2, but overall episode 1 is a nice bridge between Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2 Episode 2.Pros Picks up right where hl2 left off, no time jumps Alyx's ai is very good for a game that is 9 years old, still works almost flawlessly. Game runs very well, very little lag and no crashes Game looks great, a few graphical updates from hl2 The soundtrack is very well done, the tracks flow very well with the gameplay.Cons The only setting in the game is City 17/the Citadel. Nothing we haven't already seen in hl2. The only new enemies are the Zombines and Stalkers.  The zombines are plentiful in numbers and are fun to mess around with, but the Stalkers don't even fight back and serve little to no purpose in the game. The game is quite short, even if it is supposed to be just an episode. You might finish it in an afternoon or two. Rating There is no denying that this is a good game. However compared to Half-Life 2 and Episode 2 this installment seems to be missing what made those 2 games masterpieces. You should definetely buy this game, and it is definetely worth 8 bucks. Just keep in mind that it doesn't bring a whole lot of new things to the table like the other ones did.8/10			"

												This and Episode 2 are two ""expansions"", I guess you would say, for Half-Life 2. I honestly do not really like this one, atleast not as much as Episode 2 or the other Half-Life games. This starts off right where HL2 ended, Gordon and Alyx must go inside the citadel again, and I'm not going to say anymore about the story. This is for people who played HL2, and want more, I reccomend this for anyone who had played both games.			"

												It's rather funny that I replayed this game after years, and felt that it still stood up. Everyone is worried that linear FPS story driven games are out and everyone wants BIG SANDBOXES AND TONS OF SIDEQUESTS. This is not the case, if a new game was released, within the same style of ALL THE OTHER HALF LIFE GAMES, it honestly could go either way.I feel like as a huge fan since the 99' title, that I can safely say that's what most of us want. More of the same gameplay, but more to the story. That's what makes half life great y'know?I digress, great game, great series. If you haven't played it what the hell is wrong with you?			"

												I always thought ""Half-Life 2: Episode 1"" was a strange name for the continuation of the plot of Half Life 2 and a little undeserving in my opinion. After the hanging thread in Half Life 2, you progress the plot as Gordon Freeman once more to escape City 17 with Alyx Vance before it's reactor goes critical. The game itself can be beat in a little under 2 hours, but it's a DLC so I'll let it slide. Oh yeah: Cliffhanger ending- Check.Pretty short review; not much to say here.I rate Half-Life 2: Episode 1 with a 7/10Wait for it to go on sale before you buy it; I don't think it's worth $8, but the choice is yours.

They're actually more-so as an add-on really that expands on the first game in the series. It's just as good as the first one though this time you have an escort throughout most of the game and it's much shorter. Of course it's just as good as the first, it's just an add-on of the first!

												This game is of course a follow-up on the Half-Life 2 adventures, and what exactly happened after the tower ending in which there was no conclusion to in the main installment. This exact episode will take you through the story about the escape from the great area (and tower) before it explodes completely, which would mean the death of Freeman, Alyx, and pretty much everyone in a great scale area, so it is about escaping ASAP. Afterwards it will take you through the pressing task of saving as many remaining citizens as possible from City 17 before the - again - explosion. Essentially, it is all about escaping City 17. A must if you´re a fan of the series. This episode in particular is only really challenging in the end when it starts firing all sorts of enemies at your face, but is fairly casual-friendly up until the ending chapters - at least on normal and ""expert"". Well, not so much on expert. ;)Have fun!			"

Afterwards it will take you through the pressing task of saving as many remaining citizens as possible from City 17 before the - again - explosion. Essentially, it is all about escaping City 17. A must if you´re a fan of the series. This episode in particular is only really challenging in the end when it starts firing all sorts of enemies at your face, but is fairly casual-friendly up until the ending chapters - at least on normal and ""expert"". Well, not so much on expert. ;)Have fun!			"

												The sequal to what I consider to be the greatest game of all time, and it is still pretty good. I liked to think of Episode One as the middle child of the Half Life 2 trilogy. It doesnt really do anything that unique, but is still a very interesting and able game. Most of the enviroments are tight, so its a lot less open world compared to Half Life 2. The absolute best part of this game is the realtionship between Gordan and Alyx. Watching her interact with you is simply amazing. Valve actually made me genuinly care about a character, something very few have. This game only lasted about six or seven hours, but is still a worthwhile experience. Pros:+Everything Half Life+Lighting+Character connectednessNeutral: *Narrow enviroments*The ""Middle Child"" syndromeOverall: 9/10 If anything, you basically need to play this just to get the amazing Episode Two. Its still good in its own respect, but forgetable overall comparted to the other parts. Do not buy this on its own, get it bundled in the Orange Box.			"

												While now, this sort of content would be marketed as ""DLC"", Valve sold this as a seperate game that didn't require Half Life 2 to play, it continues the story where Half Life 2 ended and executes what happens next well! A shame that Valve has a phobia of 3's, otherwise Half Life 3 would've been released a few years ago. Varied enviroments to shoots things in, amusing dialogue from the characters and has moments worthy of a 1980's / 1990's action movie...except it doesn't overdo the comedy.			"

Admittedly, it isn't quite as impressive as Half-Life, Half-Life 2, or Episode 2, but it is definitely worth playing whether or not you are a Half-Life fan, and I feel like it is sometimes underrated, as you spend the majority of the story accompanied by Alyx, and builds off of it as the story progresses.

												I know that a lot of people were disappointed by this installment, but I had a hoot playing it. It's been a secret fantasy of mine to be part of a mass exodus out of a doomed city my whole life. I think my secret desire to make such an escape started with a Fourth of July celebration my parents took me to when I was three. These visions of hundreds of people and shimmering explosions in an unfamiliar urban setting stuck in my tiny baby brain and have been with me my whole life. So you can imagine my surprise when over a decade later I'm reliving these memories as I flee City 17 in much the same way I imagined myself all those years ago.This has left me to assume Valve has access to the Jungian archetypes of my mind.

												Half-Life 2: Episode One is a pretty good continuation of Half-Life 2. The game picks up the story from the point where Half-Life 2 ended: Gordon and Alyx are saved by the mysterious alien creatures (who are our allies here, altough we battled them - among other things - in the first game) both from the explosion and from the unpleasant guy in suit. What we get from here is an action packed escape, much like before, but this time with more zombies and almost completely set in the well known city environment. The finale may not seem as grandiose this time, but the final train ride is amazing.In addition to improved lighting, I noticed the particle effects (almost as good as in F.E.A.R.) looking better than the ones in the original game. It's visually striking how the light shines through the grains of dust.Gordon is accompanied by Alyx throughout the entire game and it is quite refreshing (the dialogues are pretty one-sided though, because Gordon still remains silent and fails to react to anything she says :)) to have her around, after the solitude of the original game. Alyx can still die if we don't pay attention, but this time she's more capable of defending herself.We have the same enemies (expect more zombies, antlions and striders) and weapons as usual (for me it wasn't an issue since I think the weapons are versatile enough), altough we can use the gravity gun more often - the environment is full of heavy, usable objects. As a matter of fact there is an achievement called 'The One Free Bullet' for which you can fire your gun only once throughout the whole game (the rocket launcher does not count as one, but the pistol, shotgun and machine guns do), that one time being crucial (you have to shoot a padlock to advance further). Attaining it may seem hindering, but it's quite fun and not as hard as it sounds.The main problem however arises from Half-Life 2: the story, or rather the lack of it. You still won't be able to find out anything about what's going on, moreover there are new mysteries as well, for example the huge, amorphous creature we meet at the beginning (seemingly using some sort of psionic attacks). For someone who values storyline above almost anything else in a single player game, this counts as quite a big mistake.After all the game is still great, but Valve should have given at least a bit more answers instead of extending the core Half-Life 2 getaway gameplay with a few more hours. Talking about hours, the game is also pretty short and can be finished in about 6 hours (took me less than 13 hours with all achievements attained). I don't think that it's such a big problem however, since it wasn't priced as a full game at it's release. It feels a bit like a link between the original Half-Life 2 and Episode 2, but I'm not saying it should be given a miss. On the contrary, you should definitely play it as it's still a great game and has some memorable moments (make sure to listen to Dr. Kleiner's speech on the menu or ingame via the city screens :))PROS+ improved lighting and particle effects+ having Alyx as a sidekick is fun+ combat is still great, fighting striders is thrilling+ some very creative achievementsCONS- story is still functional, no explanations- setting is motonous- a bit too shortRATING7.5/10			"

												I have been playing the game for years and now it won't start. Hope to get some help here as I have been unable to contact steam for assistance. Since they control access to the game it would be nice if it was easier to contact them for help. If there is a way, I have not found it. Maybe someone will see this and I can get some help because both episode one and two will not start.			"

												Before playing this game I recommend playing at least Half Life 2 to understand this game.Nevertheless if you want to understand more the world of this serie I recommend you to play the previous games in this order:Half LifeHalf Life: Opposing forceHalf Life: Blue ShiftHalf Life 2Half Life 2: DeathmatchHalf Life 2: lost coastHalf Life 2; episode 1I found this game really short but maybe it was due to the fact that I played all Half Life game before so maybe I understand better the game design. Just for saying I spent around 3 hours on this one but I will now have to try hard the achievements. "

												9/10If you liked the original Half-Life 2 game, you will like this. It is literally just a continuation, but they didn't call it Half-Life 3 because it's shorter and the story seems more like stuff they had to get out of the way to avoid plot holes and set up for the next chapter.It's an immersive, fun game, and I didn't find any glitches. You play as Gordon Freeman trying to stabilize the Citadel's core and then escaping the city, which you can do in about 2 hours.There are a couple minor additions, like stalkers, allied roller mines, antlion holes you can plug with cars, flares, and most importantly, zombines. You spend a long part of the game fighting your way through zombies, headcrabs, and zombines.Alyx accompanies you the whole way, not getting in your way at all and shooting enemies. She even gets a sniper rifle at one part. The AI really impressed me.Anyway, just buy all the Half-Life 2 games.			"

												Hello Fellow Physicists,I strongly recommend Half-Life 2: Episode One! It's a great episode addition to the Half-Life series! A cliff-hanger from the Half-Life 2 leads perfectly into Episode One! How could you not purchase it? The game dives more into your connection with Alyx Vance and several other characters that you didn't see all that much in Half-Life 2, and, not to mention, it adds more aliens into the mix! Great game, definitely worth every penny in order to continue the outstanding series!-Kyle James			"

												Episode 1 takes place IMMEDIATELY after HL2. Its super short and all that happens is you  leave city 17, setting up Episode 2 .Just as good as HL2, except its short and sweet and to the point, nothing mind blowing happens so you could watch someone play it instead of buying it if you wanted to.Total first time plus achievement hunting took me 7 hours.

												Half-Life 2: Episode OneA Combine Zombie. That's, that's like a... ah... a Zombine! Right? After Half-Life 2 was released in 2004, Valve decide to release their next Half-Life instalments in episodic sequences. This meant they could release these titles more frequently and thus fans would not have to wait as long between each instalment.***Warning, contains spoilers to previous games in the Half-Life series***The game picks up right where it left of, with the reactor in the Citadel exploding and Gordon being put into ‘stasis’ once again by the G-man. In the opening sequence a group of Vortigaunts enter the G-man’s ‘realm’ and rescue Gordon, bringing him back to city 17. After Dog and Alyx recover Gordon from beneath some rubble, they get in contact with Dr. Kliner and Eli Vance. Gordon and Alyx are informed that the Citadel core is at risk of exploding, levelling the whole city, and that they must renter the Citadel and slow the core's progression toward meltdown if they want to escape with their lives. The storyline in this game is not overly complicated as it is a very short game, taking roughly 5 hours to complete. The majority of the game is spent with Alyx, fighting off stalkers with the supercharged Gravity Gun and walking your way through abandon carparks and hospitals infested with Antlions, Headcrab Zombies and Combine Soldiers.The gameplay, as in Half-Life 2, is extraordinary. This game not only has the great puzzles and bloody shootouts like in previous games, but to keep them interesting, Valve has introduced some new features such as the Zombine, which is a Combine Soldier turned into a Zombie by Head Crabs. They have the ability to throw a grenade at you and run much faster than the normal Headcrab Zombies. Although they failed to introduce a new weapon, you can now pick up flares which are scattered throughout the game and throw them at enemies, lighting them on fire. Taking out stalkers in the citadel, escorting citizens to a train, fighting a Combine Gunship on the roof of a hospital and battling a Strider at a train station, are all highlights of the awesome gameplay in this game.The soundtracks, once again, significantly add to the gameplay. Although I can’t say there were any standouts, each one was perfectly fitted to its scene. ‘Disrupted Original’ is played during the large Zombie attack in the chapter lowlife and really adds to the tension of the scene. ‘Combine Advisory’ is played when you enter the shaft full of advisor pods, the eerie music coupled with the futuristic design of the citadel gives the whole sequence a serial and scary feeling.Level design in Half-Life has always been a strong suit of the franchise. Even though the games are linier, they can feel at times, very open world. In ‘Half-Life Episode One’ this feeling isn’t as strong as it is a short game set entirely in City 17. However each new sequence, from the citadel, to the streets, to the train station, have an incredible design. The Attic, were you fight a Gunship, can be completely destroyed giving you a limited time to hide between each shot form your rocket launcher. In the chapter Lowlife, the carpark in which you must wait for an elevator to take you to the surface is extremely dark with the only source of light being your HEV suit torch (which runs out quickly) flares (which are quite scarce) and burning crates and Head Crab Zombies if you manage to set them alight. This makes the chapter much more intense as you are constantly bombarded with waves of Head Crab Zombies which are difficult to see.This game, although not nearly as good as Half-Life 2, is still amazing. The gameplay is incredibly enjoyable however the final battle with the Strider was a bit lacking and was a relatively easy encounter for Gordon considering what he went through in previous Half-Life games. The soundtracks work well with this gameplay adding to the overall atmosphere of the scene. Level design was well thought out and even for a short, linier game, set in a cramped city, it still felt very expansive. I would say that the strongest aspect of this game is probably the story as it managed to answer a lot of unresolved questions from the end of Half-Life 2 in a very short time span, and was able to set up an even better plot for future instalments in the Half-Life series.9/10			"

												The first episode of Half Life 2 is pretty much just like the original. However, this time the game seemed to be repetitive and unfair at times. For instance, there is a part that requires you to navigate through explosive barrels and lasers, all while not getting hit. If you do, then KABOOM. I died several times on these parts, even on easy. The last mission is also extremely repetitive. Overall, it was really good.

												I know that a lot of people were disappointed by this installment, but I had a hoot playing it. It's been a secret fantasy of mine to be part of a mass exodus out of a doomed city my whole life. I think my secret desire to make such an escape started with a Fourth of July celebration my parents took me to when I was three. These visions of hundreds of people and shimmering explosions in an unfamiliar urban setting stuck in my tiny baby brain and have been with me my whole life. So you can imagine my surprise when over a decade later I'm reliving these memories as I flee City 17 in much the same way I imagined myself all those years ago.This has left me to assume Valve has access to the Jungian archetypes of my mind.

												Half-ife 2: Episode One is an Action, FPS, Singleplayer game that is a great add on to the rest of Half-Life 2's story, for all you Half-Life 2 fans.All though Half-Life 2, Ep.1 is a short game, it really builds on the story of Half-Life 2, by telling what happened after the defeat of Dr. Breen. The game adds some new features, like flares and and using cars to stop Antlions from spawning in, while retaining all of the machanics from Half-Life 2. Because this game is still made by Valve, the game can be difficult at times, and you might need to take a step back, and try the area a few times, before getting it right, just like games such as the Portal franchise, and, of course, Half-Life 2.Overall, this game is a great game. I really had fun playing it, and recommend to every Half-Life 2 fan out there, who wants that extra amount of gameplay from the franchise.			"

												As Crab said in his recommendation: ""Nothing happens in this game... I mean really you can skip it."" Of course there is a grain of truth in that statement, when held in the light of Episode 2 or even Half-Life 2, Episode One leaves much to be admired. This can be attributed to the games eco-centric location throughout the ruins of City 17 and the Citadel and the lack of varying companions throughout the game. While doing an excellent job making Alyx seem like a more believable character with well scripted combat sequences and animations you can't help but feel that she's holding your hand through it all. Personally I loved EP1 because the raw urban combat of the final levels of Half-Life 2 were my favorite levels, and Episode One extended on that making for an entire game focused on the best part of HL2. All that being said it's not imperative that you play it, and you can go from HL2 straight to EP2 without worry about missing on vital story points.			"

												Half-Life 2: Episode One is the first story-driven expansion for the original Half-Life 2 by Valve. Taking play mere minutes after the end of the first game's campaign, it follows the effort of both Gordon and Alyx as they try to escape City 17, where the collapse of the Combine Citadel is about to set off a huge explosion.As far as gameplay goes, nothing really changes from the main game, aside for new situations you have to face with the instruments you are given (one sequence, for instance, requires you to shine your flashlight on enemies to help Alyx killing them while you don't have weapons to speak of). Alyx will accompany you for the whole episode and fight alongside you.As a downside, this time around Gordon isn't as effective as in the original Half-Life 2: you spend the first half of the game armed with your gravity gun only and generally you unlock other weapons at a slow pace. While this forces you to relay on the environment and your creativity more, it can get annoying during particularly hard sequences.Half-Life 2: Episode One is roughly three or four hours long and takes places in environments you already got yourself familiar with, but still it expands nicely on the original story and keeps the gameplay fresh enough			"

												9/10If you liked the original Half-Life 2 game, you will like this. It is literally just a continuation, but they didn't call it Half-Life 3 because it's shorter and the story seems more like stuff they had to get out of the way to avoid plot holes and set up for the next chapter.It's an immersive, fun game, and I didn't find any glitches. You play as Gordon Freeman trying to stabilize the Citadel's core and then escaping the city, which you can do in about 2 hours.There are a couple minor additions, like stalkers, allied roller mines, antlion holes you can plug with cars, flares, and most importantly, zombines. You spend a long part of the game fighting your way through zombies, headcrabs, and zombines.Alyx accompanies you the whole way, not getting in your way at all and shooting enemies. She even gets a sniper rifle at one part. The AI really impressed me.Anyway, just buy all the Half-Life 2 games.			"

												If you have not played Half-Life 2, then go look at that right now.Half-Life 2: Episode One continues right where Half-Life 2 left off. Like, right there, the exact same moment.So, if you enjoyed Half-Life 2, then no doubt you will enjoy Episode One just as much. The length is considerably shorter, but paired with Half-Life 2: Episode Two, the gameplay compares nicely with the length of Half-Life 2. (Yeah, so you could look at it like Episode One and Episode 2 form Half-Life 3)Personally I feel that the events of Half-Life 2: Episode One are lackluster in their contribution to the story, and therefore the entry in the series is mostly unnecessary. However, it does provide plentiful gameplay and puzzles, which are what we are all here for anyway.Already this review is too long. The situation is simple: if you enjoyed Half-Life 2, then Episode One is more of the same, so get it if you feel it is worth playing.			"

												Hello Fellow Physicists,I strongly recommend Half-Life 2: Episode One! It's a great episode addition to the Half-Life series! A cliff-hanger from the Half-Life 2 leads perfectly into Episode One! How could you not purchase it? The game dives more into your connection with Alyx Vance and several other characters that you didn't see all that much in Half-Life 2, and, not to mention, it adds more aliens into the mix! Great game, definitely worth every penny in order to continue the outstanding series!-Kyle James			"

												While the environments and writing is on-par with the original Half-Life 2, I feel Episode One is the weakest part of the series. Most of the episode takes place underground and places less of a focus on the fast-paced action, and it generally moves a bit slower than the original Half-Life 2. Solid as an extension of the story, but unsatisfactory on its own. Only play this after you've already beaten Half-Life 2 and want to continue the storyline, Episode Two is a much more fun game.

												Half-Life 2: Episode One is the first of the two episodes that take place after the end of Half-Life 2.After an ending oddly reminiscent of the first game, we are once again left on a cliffhanger after the events of Half-Life 2. This game is the continuation of Half-Life 2, and once again we take control of Gordon Freeman on his unstoppable killing spree.While Episode One is very short in comparison to Half-Life 2, it still holds the same level of quality in terms of gameplay. The same characters are there, and a few new enemies and mechanics are introduced. None of this is exactly game-changing, yet it does keep it fresh. The story lacks a little, which is mainly due to the lenght of the game.There isn't much to say for Episode One that hasn't already been said for Half-Life 2. While it is fun to fight alongside Alyx, it doesn't quite make up for the length of it. If purchased through the Orange Box, it isn't much of a problem.Overall, definitely worth playing, but only as part of the series, and not on its own.			"

Not particularly difficult, but not easy either, so its not like you'll get bored, but at the same time its unlikely you will get stuck for a long time (and if you do theres always the developer console cheat window).I've heard some people say the gore bothers them at points, personally I didn't have this issue but I suppose the corpses lying around and the zombies can be disturbing at points for some people.You will be greatly dissapointed in yourself when you finish the game if you didn't think to buy the HalfLife2 saga as a pack, since its nearly inevitable you'll be drawn to finish the game.

												Sadly, a very short expansion pack to perhaps one of the greatest FPS games of all time. It is somewhat of an aftermath game as it picks up Gordon's story immediately after the ending of Half Life 2. Gordon and Alyx are separated and in the first part of the game your job will be to find Alyx again then the two of you can continue your journey and fight against the Combine.Other than the usual high production value you can expect from a Valve game there's no new asset here. There are no new enemy types, no new weapons, no new characters introduced. It is not necessarily a problem if you loved HL 2, however, later on they released Episode Two with enhanced graphics, new enemy types and some really good new ideas.Anyway, I am biased here as I love everything that's Half-Life. I hate Valve for not releasing the final episode as with Episode 2 they could not conclude Freeman's story. If you loved Half Life you can pick the two expansion packs labelled as episodes when they are discounted.			"

												Half-Life 2: Episode One was exactly what I expected, having the same great gameplay and atmosphere from Half-Life 2. It is basically a continuation of the story from exactly where Half-Life 2 left off so I felt it could have been included in the original game. However, the ending would've been slightly less dramatic that way and splitting the game up was good for pacing. Likes: Same as Half-Life 2, minus the vehicles because there were none. Dislikes: Once again the ending felt a bit rushed, but should probably connect will with Episode 2.Solid canon ""DLC"", good pacing.  9/10			"

												Half Life 2: Episode One while a very short game it is still a great 'short game' to be played. If you want more juicy details check out my Half Life 2 review for more information. Anywho. Let us get the elephant out of the room. This particular episode tries a little bit too hard at what it wants to be. Is this still an action adventure game? Is it a science-fiction horror FPS? The reason why I say this is because unlike in Half Life 2 where the sections are spread out. The ""chapters"" jump from one genre to the next with really no breather for the player. And I guess you can say it's because of the ""intense"" circumstances of the story. But still, Episode One could've used more chapters to spread things out rather than just cramming it all in.The story obviously takes places just hours after the events of Half Life 2. The overall goal is to get out of City 17. That's basically it. You get some ""new"" 'plot questions' in this particular game. But these 'plot questions' won't be explained until Episode 2. And even then, the new plot questions you encountered in this game and in the next episode won't be REALLY answered until (Half Life 3) <- Lol. I recommend this game. But! And this might be a hard pill to swallow. But, I think Episode One and Two should've just been in the ACTUAL Half Life 2 game rather than spacing the game out. It might've been because of budget or giving players a breather. If that's the case then they should've made Ep 1 and Ep 2 into purchasable expansions rather than actual 'full games'. I recommend buying the Orange Box rather than the games seperately btw.			"

												The second installation of the seemingly never-ending Half Life saga is an interesting one. Half Life 2: Episode One is by far the weakest of the series, but the game is required for the complete narrative. The game is awfully slow paced, and it really does nothing to advance the story. Since these episodic installments were supposedly to be released every 3 months, a slower first episode would be resonable, but since the saga is taking its time, its a bit of a dissapointment.8/10.

												I just beat it for the second time. I had beaten Half-life 2 again yesterday (I don't ever replay games) and I thought I was going to leave it at that. But no; I still wanted more Half-life greatness. So I moved onto Episode One, and now I expect myself to be replaying Episode Two as well.Episode One starts minutes after the ending of Half-life 2 and Gordon Freeman continues on his journey to fight the powah, with Alyx along with him/you. This is much shorter than Half-life 2, being an ""episode"", but there is a lot more Alyx time in this one, which is a good thing since she has a very good AI and makes for a great partner in the game. So many awesome setpieces thoughout Episode One, but that is to be expected from this consistently-amazing series. If you liked Half-life 2, don't stop there!			"

												Half-Life 2: Episode One Review - Raymond KTHalf-Life 2: Episode one demonstrates how games ought to be made, forged by dedication, imagination and risk-taking. It's an outstanding, stirring experience. Valve really has done a great job showing people that episodic content doesn't have to be such a bad thing and can give the developers a chance to implement changes to the code as hardware becomes more and more powerful with time. The game is absolutely worth playing through and should not be overlooked in any case. if you were hoping that Episode One would shed more light on Half-Life 2's cryptic storyline, keep on dreaming. Taking a cue from ""Lost,"" Episode One dances around key plot mysteries while giving very little in the way of new information.			"

												Half-Life 2: Episode One is a first-person shooter video game, the first in a series of episodes that serve as the sequel for the 2004 Half-Life 2. It was developed by Valve Corporation and released on June 1, 2006. Originally called Half-Life 2: Aftermath, the game was later renamed to Episode One after Valve became confident in using an episodic structure for the game. Similar to Half-Life 2, Episode One also uses the Source game engine. The game debuted new lighting and animation technologies, as well as AI sidekick enhancements.Pros : + The return of Gordon Freeman+ Side by side with Alyx Vance+ Zombine.....get it? + Great graphic (tweak a bit more in your graphic control pannel for better experiance)+ Crowbar is back+ Still the best game ever made+ Great sound+ Great gameplayCons : - Very short completion time- Not as much new content as we might have liked- Still waiting for Half Life 3			"

												Half-life 2 Episode One, the continue of Half-life 2.. Now you will know what happen next right? Now let's review it!The Gameplay:It's still very fun, you can't go serious at this in anyway... if you're a tryhard player you will. The weapons are still the same but they're so fun messing with it.. The Gravity Gun is the most fun weapon in the game.. so please try to enjoy the game instead of being a 100% tryhard.The Graphics:It improved the graphics than Half-life 2, at least.. playing in 720p won't take it's full effect.. so I highly suggest play this on 1080p and you will see it's texture improvement.The AI's *Artifical Intelligence*:Same as Half-life 2 but the AI's are now good.Rating: 9/10Why not 10/10?, Cause I can't give a game that is 10/10..I highly suggest people buy this only for Half-life Series Fan or a FPS Shooter Fan.

												Half-Life Episode One is a blast to play. I really enjoyed it.It's as epic as Half-Life 2 is, but what bothers me is that the length is VERY short, for an explorer like me you finish this game in max 6 hours.Beside this fact i still think this is a very, very good episode. Continuing directly where Half-Life 2 left off and i think the interactions and releations with Alyx and the other charachters seems to be stronger and better then in 2.It got as usual, great levels, graphichs and more. And one hell of a cliffhanger at the end.9/10 would defenitly reccomend to play (make sure you played Half-Life 2 before playing this) "

												This is an amazing sequel to Half Life 2. It is a bit shorter though, but the experience was as great if not greater. I loved the new HDR feature, the new mechanics of Alyx's combat, animations, how the things worked, the developer's commentary, 10/10 game. I have been once again amazed with the beauty of half life works. I definitely recommend this game. It's really nice! But I recommend playing the half life series all the way from half life 1 up to half life 2 episode 2, that's the best way.The gameplay is good, as always, not some simple shooter that you would find in some forsaken company.The graphics are too good to be explained with our human dictionary.The bugs... well, I have found one bug, although I am not sure if that's even a bug. So basically at the last chapter (Spoiler alert) I was taking the citizens to the trains, everything was good until one of them was stuck somewhere beside the stairs, he could move but he was killed instantly, what I mean is that he could have ran to the trains and would have got me an achievement, but he wasted it and died.Anyways, the game is just perfect. Played on the same breath.			"

												A great game that didn't take long at all to beat. The only thing that made it harder for me was that I tried for all the achievements the first time and couldn't use a gun the whole time because I was going for the ""The One Free Bullet"" achievement were you don't use a gun the whole time except for one time to open a gate for Alyx. The story just added onto the Original Half Life 2. You must play Half Life 2 to fully understand what is going on in this game. The graphics are great, the gameplay was smooth and very well done.

Fast paced fun with a deep and mind bendingly interesting and immersing story.

												Half-Life 2: Episode 1 sees our hero Warren doing his best to pick up the pieces left by Gordon Freeman, who for once isn't on the box art. Warren spends most of this game saving the thousands of citizens who Freeman imperiled when he destroyed the Citadel, citizens who are growing increasingly irate after having seen Freeman save, like, 15 people and then leave on a train with the hot chick on the box art. Warren must use his stealth skills to sneak into and disable Combine facilities that are keeping the citizens from escaping, and in a thrilling climax the player climbs atop a Strider and hacks into its neural interface, using it to fend off waves of opposing Striders, dropships, gunboats, soldiers, and APCs. This is the strongest installment in this series yet!			"

												It is a continuation of Half Life 2. Alyx teams up with you throughout the entire game, being a great companion and an efficient fighter. She will help is dispatching enemies too, though her default weapon is weak until she finds a shotgun later on. Either way, she is a great addition to the game.The game is relatively short, only lasting 6-8 hours. The achievements encourage multiple playthroughs , especially going for the near impossible One Free Bullet (finish the game firing one bullet, which has to be used to break a lock at the start of the game. You can use the crowbar, grenades, mounted guns, rockets, and of course the iconic gravity gun, one of the best weapons in any video game. Ever).Overall, while it may be shorter by  15 or so hours when compared to Half life 2, the quality is still there. You have the linear formula that made the previous game great, along with more challenge in the form of dark underground sections and strider runs.  A brilliant game from beginning to end. Like Half Life 2, I recommend this to Half Life fans and the general First person shooter community alike.			"

												Episode 1 is really just more of the same. It continues on from the very moment the original game finished and the player will find themselves in the thick of the action right from the start. I must admit that I thought there would be more new guns, enemies and locations in this expansion. But it appears that Valve made a decision to concentrate solely on storytelling and leading the player through a constant flow of thrilling and challenging scenarios.			"

												My review for Half-Life 2 can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/220It's good, damn good but it's not as good as Half-Life 2 or Episode 2. This has got some damn good atmosphere and combat sequnces and while short stands tall as an excellent adventure amongst FPS titles and expansions. That said it really is the middle child of the Half-Life 2 family. From replaying I've come to think it's real weaknesses come from it's exposition heavy,slow start and opening Citadel chapters. Especially when  all combined. It has you teamed up with Alyx for the entire episode and thankfully she is well written, helpful and interesting and a damn impressive showcase of AI unlike a certain Sheva. At the same time though you'll often be locked into what I call little ""cutscene"" rooms. YES you can move around freely as control is never taken away from the player in the Half-Life games but while these ""cutscenes"" as well written and interesting as they are are also unskipable and if it's not your first time playing all you can do is leap around like a fussy cat and make people look like an idiot as you attempt to jump on their head or find something to throw. The tunnels, and ESPECIALLY the remains of City 17 are when it's best. The Citadel isn't bad, FAR FROM IT, but it wasn't my favorite part on repeat playthroughs and it keeps me from speedily progressing to my favorite parts faster if I don't skip massive chunks of the gamet via chapter select that is.Episode 1 does a lot of things scripting and scenario wise that I've never seen all together in one single FPS game before especially in terms of it's design and layout but then it will repeat some of these good parts a little too much and as a cherry on top will have a character openly say ""oh god no"", ""not again"" and ""here we go again"" winkingly as you do a reocurring scripted sequence involving Combine, explosives and doors. Having a character remark at how over used a gimmick in game is and then DOING the gimmick anyway does not then excuse or fix the gimmick. It sticks out like a sore thumb as this sort of thing is uncommon in the game prior. It's like when Duke in Duke Nukem Forever sighed in disgust at a literal pipe puzzle and said ""I hate Valve puzzles."" and then proceeding to do it anyway. (And no I am not saying anything in this game is as bad as any part of the Duke Nukem Forever.)It's short (real short) but sweet and unless you don't wan't to wait forever for a conclusion after you play Episode 2 I highly reccomend you play Episode 1.

Half-Life 2: Episode One to me was a flawed entry, while my memory fades, making this difficult to review; compared to the main game it felt to me a forced sequel, being unclear what the mission of the protagonist was this time. I thought he was just forced to come back for the sake of continuity, when I finished the first game I was expecting a Timesplitters sequence of games that produced a different theme and setting with every new entry, the reality is not what I personally wanted. It did however have an acceptable survival horror atmosphere that is not out of character for the game, but it did feel slow with progression, if my memory is intact, it did little to serve the story the main game started, I basically only remember that you come back because magic and you have to escape City 17 so that the Freeman can make it to the next entry where more things happen.On its own it would probably be an a-ok Silent Hill entry where it clearly draws inspiration from, but it is short and it is slow compared to the main game. It's forced, ending in disappointment. I'd still recommend to play it, because it is necessary to play the games in sequence and the entry Half-Life 2: Episode Two is in my opinion worth it after making it through this average disappointment. Otherwise it might be difficult to follow and therefore less enjoyable so therefore, I wouldn't advise you to skip this. Due to its age, and because of  the short length, I recommend buying this at a price that matches or exceeds a seventy-five percent markdown (it very regularly goes on sale at low prices, they may as well offer the entire Half-Life franchise for free), but even better just buy the Orange Box because it comes with all of the Half-Life games and Portal (which is in the same universe) and after considering the price, it is the better value.I also recommend Garry's Mod if you're buying ancient source engine games because it provides more assets for Garry's Mod, it has tons of different game modes that you can enjoy online through public servers, such as roleplaying, cinema, and a Quake 3 recreation. It's an incredible amount of mods inside of a mod that you don't know where the game ends and the modding begins. It's a rabbit hole that doesn't end. Here is a collection of Garry's Mod, mods.E-RANKD-RANKC-RANKB-RANKA-RANKS-RANKI cleared this game on April 4th, 2014. "

												[SPOILER REVIEW]This game is pretty boring to be honest. They should've had more to offer, as there was no more than 7 chapters, and they are not very fun. It would've been fine if they didn't make this game only 3 hours long, and added a decent storyline. There wasn't much of an atmosphere that you got from the first game, which was escaping from Black Mesa, but that was worked out really good, and I thought it was better than Half Life 2, but this tries to have you escaping City 17, and it isn't very tension building or fun.This game does not deserve it's $8 price tag, you should just search up the storyline to Episode 1 and go straight to episode 2.

												""In this episodic standalone follow-up to Half-Life 2, Gordon Freeman once again teams up with Alyx Vance as they try to escape a besieged City 17."" - Offical PC Master Race curator THE REVIEW Half-Life 2: Episode One is a sequel to HL2, it brings back your female sidekick in HL2 so now you can look at her ♥♥♥ fight alongside with her again! THE CONS  It's a short game. Only 1 new enemy. THE PROS  A fun game! Challenging unless playing on easy mode. A great soundtrack! MY RATING I honestly really liked HL2: EP1.However, due to the cons it will be lowering the rating.By none.9/10 "

												I was mixed about the original Half-Life 2, so what can I say about Episode One?  Well, it's merely more of the same...just shorter.  I bet some of you are rolling your eyes and going, ""Well, DUH, that's why it's called Half-Life 2: Episode ONE!""  Well, it certainly feels as if I played the game already...which I did...and Episode One is merely the equivalent of a DLC add-on...which, given the title, it certainly is.  The game doesn't really add anything new apart from a new area to trudge through, continuing from the previous game obviously, and about one to three new enemies to shoot at for the entire game.  This is the same FPS-platforming-puzzle story I've played already, only this time it felt as if the whole thing was going in reverse.  An example would be how in the original game, the gravity gun got upgraded at the end, whereas in Episode One, it gets upgraded at the very beginning...and then it's suddenly downgraded to its usual status during the rest of the game.  I was hoping I would be able to lift and throw enemy bosses with the thing had the upgrade stayed on, but the game said no, which is still a very major flaw with this game.  Getting through Episode One literally got me through half the time it took to get through the orignal game, and that's including getting almost every Achievement.  All in all, what can I really say that hasn't been said before?			"

												Hay que comprarlo solo cuando esta en rebaja , de lo contrario estaras gastando plata porque el juego es muyy corto y en ocaciones aburrido.*SPOILERS*Es igual que el half life 2 pero al revez , los primeros capitulos estas en la ciudadela y se torna bastante aburrido matar a soldados con una arma extremadamente op , ademas de que al principio del juego los npc hablan como loros y quieres que empieze la accion de una vezEl siguiente capitulo estas a oscuras y es intrigante y entretenido la primera vez que lo juegas pero despues pierde el chiste y lo ves como un dolor de cabeza en vez de un buen capituloLos ultimos 2 capitulos son los mejores segun mi opinion pues vuelves a una ciudad 17 llena de soldados , la aparicion de las hormigas leon en la ciudad producto de las bajas defensas combine y el hecho de que la ciudad este en estado de destruccion masivo (peor que en hl2) pasas por un hospital lleno de enemigos , vas por las calles ayudando a rebeldes y mucho mas en el penultimo capituloEl ultimo capitulo es siempre visto como el peor porque es aburrido , y es verdad en cierto punto pues te dedicas a puro escoltar ciudadanos y un ""boss"" al final que es un zancudo , de esos que has matado cientos en el hl2En conclusion el juego es bueno , tiene todo lo positivo de hl2 y la primera vez que lo juegas va a hacer bastante mejor , eso significa (por un lado negativo) que el juego no es muy bien rejugable y cuando lo finalizes lo vas a desintalar y jamas lo vas a tocar , eso por 6 dolares...Hay que comprarlo en rebajas porque si no es plata perdida			"

Good things: 	-The mystic and science is awesome combinations. 	-Useful physic. 	-Nice views. Bad things: 	-This game need a little-bit strong hardware. But I guess to the newest weakest computers is enough now. 	-If you not care the story, you will not like this game.

												[SPOILER REVIEW]This game is pretty boring to be honest. They should've had more to offer, as there was no more than 7 chapters, and they are not very fun. It would've been fine if they didn't make this game only 3 hours long, and added a decent storyline. There wasn't much of an atmosphere that you got from the first game, which was escaping from Black Mesa, but that was worked out really good, and I thought it was better than Half Life 2, but this tries to have you escaping City 17, and it isn't very tension building or fun.This game does not deserve it's $8 price tag, you should just search up the storyline to Episode 1 and go straight to episode 2.

												It's hard to judge this game, because it may be considered both a part of the larger HL2 story, or a standalone game, but I'll consider only the second case - players falling in the first, surely know what/why they want to play.Well, HL2E1 didn't age well at all. I've played HL2 10+ years ago, then bought the Orange box this year following the glowing reviews, but it's been a big disappointment.In order to give perspective, it's important to consider that Bioshock - which aged really good instead, was released only one year after (same as HL2E2).The story arc is trivial and short.The physics-based puzzles are boring by today's standards - pick the ball, and put it into the container, wash, rinse and repeat.The sidekick just can't stop talking.The environments are banal.If you want to play a standalone game from the past, there is much much better.

												I give this game a mild thumbs down. It’s sort of fun, but it’s by far the weakest game in the series. There are too many poorly designed missions and not enough variety in the scenery/activities.There is one overtly tedious mission near the start when you are trying to shoot the reactor with lasers that is just mind numbing. Also, towards the end of the game there is an escort mission that’s a candidate for worst escort mission ever. It’s bad enough, you have to ferry survivors to safety once, but for this mission you have to lead multiple groups over the same territory a half a dozen times.If you are a fan of the series, you will probably get enjoyment out of this game, I’m just disappointed that it wasn’t anywhere near as good as Half Life 2.6 /10			"

												I'm between Yes and No for recommending this game. Althought this episode was a little chaotic and objectives were not very fun, I still think it is a crucial episode in the Half Life franchise.The game is good but worse than Half Life 2 in few ways. The storytelling is a little rubbish and it was more like I was watching a really long cutscene with mediocore objectives such as escorting civilians four times in a row, it felt more like a ""transition"" from HL2 to Episode Two. The only unique thing about fighting in this game is that it made good use of the flashlights. Lots of dark areas in this game, almost horror considering I'm arachnophobic and headcrabs scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of me.On the bright side, I think what this episode had done well is the relationship between Gordon and Alyx. There were many suggestive scenes and dialogues that made us feel like Alyx did have some sort of a school girl crush on Gordon since HL2. I thought this episode really gave us a chance to let Alyx blend into the story much more so her existence is a little more obvious and valuable. I really thought everything was natural and it wasn't forced, they did well on this part. So kudos to them.BUT THEN AGAINWHERE IS HALF LIFE 3			"

												This game... Before the review of this game I will say my opinion about the sagaI had some fun while playing Half Life 2 and it's episodes but... People say that is one of the best games ever, Half Life 1 is a good game, also a revolutionary game, and even one of my favorite games, but Half Life 2 and it's episodes aren't that great, the source engine created an overated game, because the only jump between Half Life and Half Life 2 was the look and the enviroment, but if you want a super especial history or gameplay like people say then you probably will get a disapointment, is a good game but nothing especial or extraordinary...With my opinion of the whole saga out of the way my opinion about this episode is just that is like a short DLC, not too short but not as long as I spected, I already completed the 100% and dind't got anything different from Half Life 2, same weapons, same enemies, literaly same enviroment. The only changes were the maps and... That's about it, the game is really a regular campaign DLC so for the recent market of the AAA games this is a jew... So yeah you decide if you want it.			"

												Please bare in mind I literally played this for the first time today (Nov 2016).I remember everyone saying that this was the game that sculpted modern day games. Particularly FPS games. Now I understand why so many of those tedious stand and waste time moments exist in games. Half Life 2.So many times in this very short episode do you stand there watching a wheel go round slowly while you open a shutter. For no other reason than to waste our time.I enjoy the physics puzzles still. They should be used more in gaming.The AI drove me insane though! Several times I got trapped in a doorway with Alex stood behind me not moving. Where I had to load or kill myself to get free.I have no real care for anything in this world. To be honest I have almost no idea what the f*** I just did for the last couple of hours. Why does this episode even exist?You wake up. Lurch from area to area doing ""stuff"" and then the credits roll. That's pretty much it. The slimsy bit of story that exists kind of gets forgotten until the last scene.Maybe back in the day this was excellent but honestly this gameplay no longer stands up. The last few years we've seen the resurfacing of open world games. That is for the best. Linear ♥♥♥, time wasting shooters are no longer entertaining for me.Plus since the whole ""Chapter 3"" has yet to emerge in any form I guess the second chapter is going to be just as pointless story wise.Yes I apreciate this is an old game but honestly I'm feeling like you had to be there nearer to its release to understand the appeal. Glad I waited for a sale to play this now.			"

												My old review was too long, so let's clean it up.  Overall, 6 or 7 out of 10.  Not a definite recommendation.  Only play it if you don't mind slogging through the middle of the game where it's absolutely no fun at all.This game was decent.  It's a linear shooter.  It's the low point of the Half-Life series, but it still was fun until you got to the ""Low Lifes"" chapter.  Then, we get to fight the real enemies, not this underground-low light crap with antlion spam.  We get combines and more zombies, with Alyx usually either sniping or in the middle of a battle with you, which means no more cheesy lines from her that irritate the hell out of you.  The hospital level was perfect for getting you out of the underground crap, taking you right into where the game belongs... something reflected in Episode 2, where we didn't have that downtime where antlions are everywhere and we can't see anything.As for storyline, maybe it felt different as what ""re-opened the HL series and made something out of that unresolved ending from HL2,"" but for me, it felt like that explanation between HL2 and Episode 2.  It would be fine as a 3-minute recap (which is in there for Episode 2, if you just want to skip over this).  It's okay.  The storyline itself is just continuing HL2 straight from the ending, where (NOT SPOILING IT) and you wake up in a junkyard where D0G uncovers you.  You go back to (NOT SPOILING IT) via junkyard car now powered by D0G's incredible hulk powers and (NOT SPOILING IT).  You end up... look, I can't tell you, it's all just spoilers.  It was okay for storyline, while adding more space for time-consuming lore that I'll never even bother to google because of my social life conflicting with spending all my time pondering the mysteries of the Half-Life franchise.Either get this game and force yourself through the middle part where the game sucks, or just skip to Episode 2, a game without any sort of ""crappy section,"" and watch the 3 minute recap of Episode 1 complete with post processing as soon as you click new game.  The choice is yours.			"

												Valve made a gigantic mistake with their episodic release concept. It tried to deliver content faster and it failed immensely, giving chunks that just weren't enough to please fans at the time. The cliffhanger ending didn't help either, a cheap way to end any game. Then if that wasn't enough, they stuck Alyx at the side of the player throughout the game. She becomes more of a nuisance than a welcome partner, mainly with her intimate remarks towards the player. Her nonstop presence is in stark contrast to previous titles, where the player's quest was mostly a lonely ride with only short periods where characters followed. This sense of isolation really improved the previous titles, and here I feel it was a bad design choice to stick Alyx to the player for all of the ride. I think the main reason why Alyx doesn't work, is because she ends up trying to be romantic with the player and not Gordon, as Gordon doesn't talk or have any personality, he's just a suit for the player to wear. This ends up being incredibly awkward.All in all the episodic content idea was bad, even Valve knows this. It delivered an underwhelming chunk of a game that didn't provide enough, and it was also marred by the continous presence of a character whose remarks towards the player were more cringe inducing than story-building.

												One of the best sequel a game could ever had: Valve once again proved that despite the long waiting time they do make sure that once they put up a game, its a quality work and its indeed true for the Half Life series. Very good continuation of the original story, Episode One takes the player and doesnt let down until the end, with its fantastic, adrenalin-pumping story and for the first time featuring Alyx too among Gordon Freeman and how their relationship evolves during the game, thanks to the absolutly well done character rag-doll animating.This game is a must buy for all the Half Life series fan. Despite being quite short, it stands up quite well for what it is and absolutly worth its price			"

												Holy crap! Is all i can say. There is only one complaint that i have and its the AI! Oh lord! She is only good for opening doors and killing. Which in Half Life you would think is enough. But this is the first Half Life, and Valve game, where i was frustrated by the difficulty. A challenge is one thing, but this is on a whole nother level. Alyx will literally not go where i want her to go, and for some reason this game has two(maybe more) instances where you are basically at the mercy of how good and how fast she can kill things. The scenes i am talking about are the ones where you turn the wheel to open the gate. And it would not be a problem if there were not so many antlions poking you causing the gate to close.I would have thought that having someone follow you around would make the game a little bit easier, and she is pretty handy, but having her around is just a nuisance. In Half Life 2 there was a part where you ""command"" soldiers to navigate the streets to get to the Citadel. And just keeping them alive was a pain because they went where the pleased most of the time. But at least for them you had some sort of control. Ive found myself having to push her to go where i want her to.The good things i have to say about this game were the graphics and story. I played Half Life 2 on Xbox and on my Xbox 360.  And that game came out a while ago, so the graphics werent as sharp or at least from my experience. But wow! The graphics were amazing! This is a beautiful game.The story is great. I am already hooked and it is only the beginning stages of the game. Valve does a good job at making people want to continue the game just to find out what happens next in the story. In Half Life 2: episode one I am trying to bear the headache of having Alx join me because ever since i finished Half Life 2 many years ago I was left wanting more, especially with that ending!Overall i do recommend this game but buyer beware that it will take a whole lot of patience and a whole lot of time to get used to her. The main reason i think buyers would like this game is for the story. If you care more about the story then this game satisfies that. It is definitely a game that gamers should play at least once in their life just to experience Alyx AI			"

												Now... This game... By no means is good. I'd say it is slightly below mediocre (Probably didn't spell that right) First of all, you should only play this is you have beaten Half-Life 2. Second of all, it's just not very good. It's short, and un-interesting. It's all repeated gameplay from the last game. The only reason you should get this is if you really, really enjoyed Half-Life 2, and are wanting to play Episode 2. Episode 2 is so much better than this. So, if you can power through this game you will not be as disapointed in the next.			"

												Don't have much to say on this one. Unlike Blue Shift or Opposing Force, Episode One just feels like ""More HL2"" as opposed to a fresh expansion. It's much shorter than the main game, which makes it less tedious as you feel like actual forward progress is made, but other than that all I can say is I probably would've had more fun if I weren't going for that ""use no bullets"" achievement.

												I did not enjoy it.I really, really wasn't having fun. Because it was barely a game. It was basically just a case of ""Follow the one-way narrow path for half an hour, solve a simple puzzle, follow this other path for half an hour..."", and the story and setting wasn't even remotely good enough to make that work. Occasionally, enemies would show up - and die two seconds later, because as fun as the super gravity gun was at the end of HL2, it was fun because it was satisfyingly overpowered. Here, it's just... boringly simple.I wasn't a big fan of HL2 to begin with - I first played it too late (Orange Box), so everything that was a cool novelty when it came out was already old hat by the time I got it. But this is just measurably worse. As if it was made by a different design team.Oh, and short, etc.			"

												Half-Life 2: Episode One. I guess you can say....It's a HALF-Sequal. Admit it...you smiled a little....Smile for Gaben's sake you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. So this sort of half sequal to the game is very short game. It's five bucks right now, but I say it's worth it. Kind-of. I am in the middle between Yes and No to recommending this. It's short and it's not as hard as I expected. Or maybe that's just the love of Half Life 2 talking. Gameplay: Same as the old one. Graphics: Better than Half Life 2. When I first entered the game and saw Alyx's face. I was smiling because it was more HD than HL2. But those effects start wearing off after I started focusing on the gameplay. But I have to admit I did was in awe here and there after the effects seemed to have rolled off.Music: Great as always in my opinion.Why should I not buy this game?It's very short. So you have TWO (bad joke) options if you like HL2. Get the game or watch a guy complete it on youtube. If you dont mind watching it on Youtube. Watch it on Youtube! If you mind, you should get the game.Ending statements:It's up to you. I am in the middle of this so I cant really say what you should pick. Watch it on Youtube or get the game. *Gaben voice* Thanks! And have fun!			"

												Only play this for the storyline or if you're a hardcore HL fan. There's only a couple chapters (the last one is just a teaser for HL2: ep.2), the order in which you aquire guns is way outa' whack (you only get the crowbar towards the end of the game), and the ""Lowlife"" (third chapter) levels are more of an annoyance than a theme. There's only one gunship and strider in this game that you get to fight and in terms of new enemies, all you get is the zombine. Going back to the lack of chapters, I'd like to point out that even if you're not speedrunning, you can beat this game in about three hours.Why this gets an 80+ MetaCritic rating I have no idea. I'd give it a 6/10; VALVE really messed this one up.			"

												Short and boring but you gotta get over it to play very well made Episode 2Half of episode is just running with alyx through the tunells, it gets little better when you finally get out but like you see, my playtime for this game is pretty short. Cant recommend it, its almost as unnecessary as Barneys expansion in first Half-Life. You dont really have to play it, you may as well watch first and last ""cutscenes"" and youd know as much as I did after playing through it.			"

												Half-Life was a real good game and Half-Life 2 improved on it so much.But this Episode didn't even try to 'revolutionize' the Half-Life franchise.I love Half-Life but this Episode's gameplay felt like a direct copy-paste of Half-Life 2...The story was fine I actually felt like that was the cake but for a franchise built up around revolution it didn't fill the gap between Half-Life 2 and the game I am currently playing (guess what it is) which I am particularly enjoying so i'd say if you are playing the games from Half-Life to Blue Shift to Opposing Force to Half-Life 2 etc you would have to play it but if your playing Half-Life not for the story than it's worth passing over.Post-Script: if my time spent in this game seems a little off it is because I played it offline.

												I have recently played HL2 for the first time and I hated it. I heard so many good things about it, but couldn't like it at all. Of course, the game is dated. I've got HL ep. 1 & 2  at the same time and now I'm playing this game and I hate it again. I want to play it because I don't like having games on my steam that I haven't touched, but this game frustrates me. I'm only at the beginning, but the girl (whatever her name is) is so annoying. She's comepletely useless and stands always in the way and takes to long to open a door. With only the gravity gun (first part of game) to kill the enemies, the game is slow and not fun for me. I hope the game changes this up a lot, because if this keeps on going like it does now, I won't finish this game and never start ep. 2. The game takes a lot (almost everything) from HL2, so if you liked that game, I guess you'll like this one as well. I know the half life franchise is a fan-favorite of many gamers, but for me, it's not good. There are way better shooters out there.			"

												I really was wainting a better game. it pains me talk like that of a Half Life game, but that is the truth. This game 2 hours playing and all I can say is, the plot is boring, you just run through a ruined factory, or whatever, using only the gravity gun. For God sake, why you need to pass more than one hour using only the gravity gun, what sucks as a weapon, when every enemy is using a machine gun?!! Their weapons simple vanish preventing you from getting it. The gravity gun should be like the kinetic in Dead Space, a bad and slow weapon used only you are out of ammo, just like the classic crowbar. If you only will give me only the bad weapon, give me my crowbar! And when you finally get you gun, the alien zombie enemies, that don't shoot you, begins to appears. It means, the game can have you using the gravity gun against armed soldiers, but you need a gun to fight unarmed aliens. Very logical!Half Life 1 is one of the best games I ever played, I really though that Half Life 2 was inferior into everything, with exception of graphics, than the first one, but still playable, beatable and funny. But this third one, is too weak, it is boring, have parts the that ♥♥♥♥ you off. For exemple, the part of elevator that wreckage falls from the ceiling, and you are supose to shoot that before it falls, but they end uo falling and breaking the elevator too fast for you to get a shock orb (or whatever that is) and shoot them in the falling wreckage, and the gravity gun has too little range to shoot them directly in time. I needed to repeat that many time until I finally got the way, and the next part, you are supose to grab a computer out of the way with the gravity and shoot a shock orb, but there is no indication that you can grab that, and that is a major flaw of the gravity gun, you never know when you can shoot the gravity repeller, or grab any thing, and when it decides you can shoot, doesn't mean you can grab, this takes me to other part of the game that sucks, when the train crashes. There you can shoot anywhere, but can grab nothing, I needed a walkthrough to figure out that I needed to grab the soldier that was attacking the girl, and drag him out for she to escape, until there I was only shooting him, what more should I think? The gun shoots, the thing is attacking, so shoot him.Anyway, being Half Life doesn't make a good game, the Valve should had it tested to the end before launching, and correcting this problems, and rethink the idea.

												You would think that a game of this age would be nearly bug free, however not even 20 minutes into the game a player can experiance a game breaking glitch which can ruin the entire experiance. Valve has known this glitch exists(as its all over the web) yet they have elected to do absolutely nothing regarding it. So overall, you might not get past the first 20 minutes without resetting, reinstalling, and reconfiguring the game... Good job Valve.However, having 100 percented the game I can offer a more in depth look into the game, while always offering the classical challenge of the Half-Life series, this game seems to ease the burdon on the challenge as the first whole level of the game you have the one shot grav gun, after that there isnt much a challenge with te shotgun.A third aspect is that the game was overall short, it took me four hours for the storyline but after that with the action moments of the game, it just feels like there wasnt a long in-depth playthrough but rather a 30 minute short film... Overall, I would say wait for Half-Life 3, but since that will never exist you should buy this anyway.			"

												What the ♥♥♥♥ is this game even supposed to mean?It shows off the ""improved"" facial animations and whatnot as if they make the game great, but they don't. Sure, they can make good games better, but if the game has nothing, they obviously cannot.I do know that HL and HL2 shows off technologies, too, but they don't depend on it like this game does. Well, HL doesn't, at least, that's for sure.I regret that I paid $1.19 for this piece of ♥♥♥♥. Man, $1.19 is a lot. I could have bought 10 Umaibō with that.Avoid this game at all cost. I mean, don't let this thing cost you.			"

												This review contains spoilers regarding Half-Life 2.Riding on the high octane ending of Half-Life 2 and acting as a direct continuation, Half-Life 2: Episode One manages to be a safe, if not fulfilling, addition to the Half-Life series.Sticking with the known working formula, in Half-Life 2: Episode One you resume control of Gordon Freeman. Throwing the ending of that game to one side, Gordon finds himself back in City 17 with Alyx and a Citadel on the verge of leveling the entire city. Throughout this episode you venture back into the Citadel to contain the core and then proceed to try and escape City 17 before its destruction.The issue with this game is it brings very little new to the table. The environments are all rehashes of what was seen in HL2 - the Citadel, the streets and buildings of City 17. The only original feeling portion of the game is where you have to fight through a hospital, constantly being assaulted by Combine and Zombies, with an assault ship opening fire through any window you pass by. Amongst the zombie horde is a new creature: the Zombine. This headcrabbed Combine soldier is stronger and faster than the other zombies, possessing the ability to pull grenades out in a kamikaze run. It spices up the variety little, but only a little, for the most aprt they still act like everything else you've encountered so far. The sections with the Citadel are interesting; now a degenerating and highly unstable building that the Combine are fleeing, but ultimately it's not too indifferent from the final stages of HL2.The final, and largest, criticism is the length. This game can be completed in roughly five hours. For a game that offers little advancement in plot, instead focusing mainly on combat, there's not a lot here to make it an essential play. Don't get me wrong, it's worth playing if not just to have an excuse to dip back into the HL2 world, but this game struggles to have any sort of re-playability value when HL2 does everything this game does - only better.

												Episode one begins right after the end of Half-Life 2 so it is a necessity to play the previous game, which is about four times the length. You still get to use the Gravity Gun and you still get to ride some cars, but it all seems much lazier than the second episode or the original Half-Life 2. I don't know why, but it just feels there's not enough action, and even though Half-Life as a whole is a linear shooter, Episode One feels like one maybe a bit too much. But it still is a great game, just not as good as the previous or the next installment...			"

												Everything said about Half-Life 2 applies to this Episode. I only dock a star because it's so short. 4 stars out of five.			"

												The episodic approach at story telling seems to work very well at shoring up the short comings of the base Half-Life 2's story. It forces the telling of a specific, condensed narrative, and consequently seems to have provided more story in its short life than the main game did otherwise. Episode 1 has the added bonus of utilizing the most entertaining game play mechanics of the main game, specifically the empowered gravity gun, which is sure to bring a gleeful smile to a gamer's lips.

												Following on excellently from HL2, and the exact same atmosphere still inducing shivers up the spine, this acts as the epilogue to the events of Nova Prospekt and City 17. Perhaps some areas were lacking in the way they failed to introduce a new aspect to the equation (judging how much of it is similar to the street combat from the previous), however the venturing into the dark underground, into the core of the citadel and outside City 17 really summarises the past story arc, and beautifully permits continuity for the next chapter of the story against the combine. Really, HL2 cannot be completed without this episode.			"

												HL2: E1 is a better zombie survival horror game than most games that are actively trying to be zombie survival horror games.			"

												Episode 1 maintains much the same of Half Life, but with a notable addition - I feel that Alyx's AI was greatly updated for the release, as throughout the game, it is quite spectacular. At times you forget she is an AI, and you can easily feel like you're playing with a friend, as she controls and responds to the game perfectly.A fine feat, thank you Valve.			"

												Overall, I really did not enjoy it as much as I enjoyed Half Life 2, it was really frustrating at some places, to the point where I enabled godmode because I was just annoyed by the situation, in other parts of the game however, it was really nice and fun (everything in the citadel) but after that there were some really  annoying parts, for example when you had to wait for the elevator or the fight in the end with the Strider. Still, if you liked Half Life 2 and are planning to finish the series, you must play this, especially because EP2 is much better and you need EP1 for the story.			"
