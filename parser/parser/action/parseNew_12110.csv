It was a long time ago.2002. GTA: VC is coming out.This was a game way ahead of its time. If GTA III was, no doubt, a breakthrough, it wasn't that perfect.Vice City, on the other hand, was. The main change of time and place was spot on. Miami, 80's, blood, drugs, sex and rock'n'roll.With combination like that it couldn't go wrong, and it didn't. Polishing the predecessor's engine and graphics, VC expanded everything: map, weapons, cars, abilities and so much more. But the most important part was that it did it more subtle than San Andreas, for example.To have this kind of freedom and variety in the open world game was completely mindblowing 14 years ago.And I still think that this is and probably always will be the best GTA game for me.-Hey, member, member Vice City? -Mmm, yes, I member!The story is a classic from-bottom-to-the-top-Scarface-like journey. And although it's nothing spectacular, all well-written characters, funny lines of dialogue and memorable missions made it special.Just take a look at what kind of jobs were there and tell me you don't miss it:- Explode a building with RC helicopter- Dress as a cop and plant a bomb at the mall- Steal a ♥♥♥♥ing tank in a broad daylight from main street- Produce and promote your own porn movie- Jump between two skyscrapers on a bike- Fight off a french army on a boat- Join the gang, start a war, join the other gang, repeat- Buy an ice-cream truck and sell dope from itDon't forget the first massive Bank Heist with several preparation missions beforehand.♫""...keep feeling fascination""The absolute classic, Vice City will forever pass the test of time for me.Nostalgic, colorful, warm and welcoming city.Dangerous, unforgiving and corrupt city.City of love, hate, awesome music, politics, gangwars, drugs, criminals and ♥♥♥♥♥s.City of opportunity, quintessence of the American Dream.The city you want to come back to sometimes.Vice City.

												So, it takes a couple of fan patches to get working correctly for contemporary and widescreen set-ups; but, this game's pretty good fun.Great writing, goofy AI and humor, and arcadey gameplay.  Amazing '80s soundtrack.  Unfortunately, '80s Miami is brought down by really fugly graphics.Of course, buy on sale.

												Ignore my steam playtime, i've played this for hundreds of hours back in the day.-----------Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, released in 2002. It was set in 1986 in Vice City (Fictional name for Miami Beach, Florida, i guess it's not hard to tell). A game that is still one of the greatest games of this era, in 2003 everyone was crazy about it. You can judge if this is a masterpiece or not by just looking at it's popularity even nowadays, how many games that are 11 years old are still played today? Not many. The atmosphere you find in this game is perfect, your ears are delighted with great tracks from: Michael Jackson (Never liked him, but he had some great tracks), Megadeth, Anthrax, Cutting Crew, The Whispers, The Outfield, Bryan Adams, Iron Maiden, Loverboy, Slayer, Judas Priest, even Frankie goes to Hollywood, and the list goes on more of course.The graphics were absolutely amazing at the time of release. Gameplay was, and still is great, the mechanics are friendly. You ave a variety of weapons to choose from when it comes to slaughtering random people on the street, including hookers and old ladies. The cars you find in this game, are mostly sport ones, you also can find scooters and motorbikes.You play as Tommy Vercetti, a mafia member that just got out of the prison. You are involved in a deal that gone wrong and you need to find the people who 'backstabbed' you'. In my opinion, this is the greatest GTA game released, shame that GTA V kinda 'dodged' the actual GTA feeling there once was, but hey, we have to move forward!. I would love to see a GTA: Vice City remake, nonetheless.As for the technical stuff about this game. It works on Windows 8.1 flawlessly, without any compatibility options set, or any patch or modification. It recognizes new resolutions (1440x900 user here). A perfect game that gave me hundreds hours of fun many years ago.			"

												Vice City is probably the best GTA that has been made to date. Obviously, as a PC gamer, this opinion does not include GTA V as that one was never released by Rockstar on my favourite platform. I personally liked GTA IV a lot and the reviews on the latest installment were very promising - I just think Vice City was more captivating than the rest.Vice City looks dated, yes. Please bear in mind that this is an eleven year old game and considering the capacity of our smart phones this game is accessible as an Android application as the game's engine can easily be handled by our phones' hardware. Its atmosphere, however, is still captivating even a decade after its release so playing such an ""old"" game on a widescreen monitor with next-gen hardware is no shame!You play as Tommy Vercetti (voice by Ray Liotta) and you are in the '80s. You have cars, music and even film references from this era. Some scenes remind you of Miami Vice while others are clearly a nod to Pacino's character in Scarface. How cool is that?You have dozens of missions available. Some continue the main story while other are just side missions. Each includes a cutscene with amazing voice acting so it is a crime to skip any of the available missions. Oh, you don't want to do any of these? No problem: Vice City allows the player to just cruise in the city, steal cars, crash these cars, harass citizens (with these cars, too). You can drive a cab and earn some money at your leisure. Or steal a police car and become the terminator of vigilantes.There are tons of things to do in GTA. And while Vice City is certainly an outdated game nothing else out there can remind you how cool the '80s were than this piece of treasure.			"

Grand Theft Auto: Vice CityLong, long and long time ago, when i played VC first at my old classmate on PS2. I really liked it, the feeling and the gameplay, everything. Then its released to PC, my friend told me he want to try a game(because his laptop was too low to run this game lol) so i told him ofc he can play it. We installed it on P3 500MHz 256 MB ram and 16MB nVIDIA Vanta/LT It was so laggy, mayb 10-15 FPS, but we didn't care about it. Those good times was really great. I remember we played it more than 10PM and my friend's older brother came to say now you should already come home, hahaI played this game a lot. Vercetti character is the best. Vercetti: No sonny, i dont't have the money! Sonny: that was my money Tommy! My money!!! :DAfter many years i just browed eBay somewhy and i found an original 2003 boxed version of Vice City for PC for auction!Of course i won it! :33Now its on my desk with all of content! :) I love it! I REALLY PREFER THIS GAME TO ANYBODY! THOSE 80' years oh my god :DLOVE IT! "

												I should mention that i've played this a lot during the last couple of years. And i modded it A LOT.GTA Vice City is one of the best GTA games ever made! The setting is perfect, they got the feel of the '80s in there and all in all, it looks great, even today, after 11 years. There are TONS of mods for Vice City and people are making mods even today! Native controller support is kinda wonky but GInput's there to fix that. Just install GInput, get x360ce if you don't have a 360 pad and enjoy! Cars don't have enough polys? Xbox Cars to PC to the rescue! Road Textures too muddy for you? A lot of mods exist that fix that, but Miami Real Roads (By RWWPL @GTAGarage) is a personal favorite of mine. And the list goes on and on.			"

OverviewDespite its age, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is still an extremely fun game. I have played every GTA game to date and despite my love for Grand Theft Auto 5, I still prefer Vice City and in the paragraphs below I will attempt to explain why.A Good Starting PointI love GTA 3. The game has quite a lot of enjoyable gameplay and during my most recent playthrough, I didn't have too many issues (besides the races), which was fairly impressive for a game of its age. This certainly does nor mean the game is amazing. In 2016 the game is both a bit clunky and also lacking aesthetic wise. The game was a good starting point and a great transition from the 2D gameplay of old into the 3D realm we know today. I understand how revolutionary GTA 3 was, however looking back in 2016 with the incredible GTA 5 out as well as some decent competitors such as Watch Dogs 2 and Mafia 3, GTA 3 doesn't stand up as well as it used to. Vice City (in my opion) does.Standing Up to Modern Open-World GamesOpen worlds are getting bigger and bigger as both time and hardware move forward. In an era full of games with huge landscapes that take hours to explore, revisiting Vice City was very refreshing. It takes about 10 minutes maximum to traverse the map and that is without counting for the race cars which can be found around every corner. I feel I have to truly get into a game in order to play it nowadays. You can't just sit down, do a quick mission and then leave again. This is mostly personal but a lot of Vice City's charm comes with its simplicity, in my eyes at least. Of course, the game isn't ""simple"" as I put it but compared to modern open world games it's far from complex; thats why I love the game. It's so easy just to do a few missions, save and quit. I think if the game tried to be complex it would've been left in the dust as time went by, but the games simplistic charm is what truly makes it timeless.GameplayAiming/ShootingMy main quarrel with this game is it's aiming mechanics and this is stemmed from the lack of over the shoulder aiming. Shooting accurately in third person is a pain. Let's say you have someone directly in front of you that you need to shoot. You aim your crosshair at them, but due to the camera angle, this makes you look at the ground missing your target. Instead, you aim above the target so you shoot straight in front of you (in theory). You shoot into the sky. This is quite easily fixed by scoping with the Assult Rifles however that makes 2/3s of weapons redundant. This is mainly a sign of age, however, the Assult Rifles spoke of earlier are not hard to find.Driving/FlyingDriving is very smooth for keyboard and mouse and is both playable and enjoyable. The flying is rather hard to get used to. In the modern day, it is rather rare to use the num pad to control anything let alone something as complex as a helicopter. It is very hard to control at first, however, upon getting used to can be fun to use. Boats are ok but a bit odd due to the physics engine.PhysicsThe physics engine for this game is both a bit clunky and also glitchy due to its age, however it is rare to have an issue with it in normal gameplay. Cars occasionally slide upon collision and some bigger vehicles can seem weightless and tip over but these issues are rare.The Story and MissionsThe story follows Tommy Vercetti as he is forced into the crime underworld of Vice City, a Miami-inspired metropolis filled to the brim with gangs, drugs and greed. You, through the eyes of Tommy, rise up through the criminal world and slowly build your empire gradually making more and more money. Admittedly the story can be a bit cheesy and predictable but this fits the pumped up 80s action film tropes that this game likes to both mock and mimic. Most missions are fun and interesting. You can go from stealing a phone from a gang of chefs to blowing up part of a mall and attempting to escape with a 5-star wanted level. Of course, a few missions are difficult and require multiple runs, but that just adds playtime.The EndThank you for reading my review. At the price this game goes for, I would recommend you pick it up. Who knows you might just fall in love all over again. "

												Grand Theft Auto: Vice City puts in the adventure of Tommy Vercetti who tries to find rich and prosperity in the infamous city of Vice City during the 1980's. There are a lot of similarities between Vice City's story and the movie Scarface; I'll let you see for youself.Unlike Grand Theft Auto III, Vice City is wild, colorful and of course, BAD. The world truly captures the 80's feeling, not just with cars, people or the environment, but with music. The first song you are guaranteed to hear, is Michael Jackson's Billie Jean. Other notable songs include Killed the radio star. Heck look at the tags for this game 'Great soundtrack', speaks for itself.Bottom line is, buy it, play it, love it.			"

												An old classic.- Supports controllers with usermade mods.- In widescreen mode the crosshair by default is misaligned, use this mod to fix it:http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=23407- If your framerate goes above 60, cars will be unable to go in reverse. Enforce a 60 fps cap with eg. Dxtory for optimal experience.			"

												Grand Theft Auto Vice City, A timeless classic. although its 10+ years old its still fun. you dont need a great computer to run it obviously lol the controls are a little weird at first ecspeically if your use to this game on the consoles. The story is great, alot of funny and interesting caracters to meet, alot to explore in such a small map. a decent amount of car motorcycles and helicopters,only one plane though. you can expect a good 30-60 hours of gameplay depending on wether you 100% it or not. you can do a bunch in this game aside from the main story, tons of side missions, hidden packages and easter eggs. tons of classic songs too, great if your into 80's music. this is review is based off of years of playing this game not just 7.3 hours on steam :)			"

												Some time ago I was reviewing GTA 3 and said it's still a classy and enjoyable product, even by todays standards. Well, I wasn't lying, but I know that the industry have made a huge leap forward since the times of the GTA 3 release. Honestly saying, even the GTA V is not an absolute king of the day at moment. It's just a one great game from the row. But, it's a progress which is really much obliged for everything to the GTA 3, Vice City and San Andreas games. Those titles are like cornerstones of the great skyscraper of the gaming industry and the milestones for its progress altogether.Oh, anyway, let's cut short to the game already, yeah?The top selling points of the Vice city, are - the spirit of 80's, with music, cars and everything, and the cunning story, with the main character who's not just some random guy like Claude from GTA 3 or people before him. Those things are good and touching even now. Jeez, I love the 80's! And I love the Vice City game!Yeah, by the time it was released, there was some more things to talk about. Like the weather visual effects, addition of bikes, and some more things - all of them was mind-blowing then, but seems standard issue now. Even the furious missions like ""the Demo man"", where you need to blow things with RC models, while using quite the challenging controls and time limits to do so - now seems as usual stuff as well. I bet many drone operators in the US who are using the real deal Predators somewhere in the Afghanistan, have started with the GTA RC missions...But, if you're now wandering, if the GTA Vice City is still an option to play, and what's for, I'll answer you: Yes, for it's the blast from the past, with the whole set of things we're love 80s for. And yeah, it's quite playable, after you tune yourself with controls a bit.So, my mark is 8.5/10, and I recommend the game for everyone.			"

												I absolutely 100% recommend this game to anyone wanting to get into the older GTAs. It's a great starting point as it has better gameplay than GTAIII and quality of life features. It's story and presentation have aged like fine wine, the voice actors and performances are also great, and it was the starting point of where GTA started getting it's own identity in terms of presentation and stories.There is one huge caveat though, if you think you're going to just buy this game on Steam and enjoy yourself, you're badly mistaken honestly. Rockstar's previous efforts of putting GTA on PC were absolutely laughable in comparison to where they are now with GTAV, which is an awesome version of the game. Vice City is one of the most annoying video game experiences I've had just out of the box, so I've spent some time modding the game. My recommendation is based off my experience with Vice City with 3 Essential mods installed and honestly only buy this game if you're going to mod the game with these 3 mods.- Ginput (Fixes basic PC controls to a more modern/natural feel, as well as adds XInput functionality. ALSO WORKS FOR SA AND 3)- GTAVC Widescreen Fix (A quick internet search of this mod will bring you to the correct site where there is support for San Andreas, ViceCity, and GTA 3)- SilentPatch (Fixes a TON of issues, just download it)Vice City is an outstanding game that I think must be experienced in this day and age, it's outstanding theme, radio soundtrack and characters make it impossible to forget after experiencing it, and it's a stepping stone in Rockstar's legacy.

												Why would you want to play this old♥♥♥♥♥game when GTA V is out? Just kidding.Hi, I'm Dubgame. You may remember me from such reviews as ""Fallout: New Vegas"", ""Hotline Miami"" and ""Bad Rats"". Now I have been playing Grand Theft Auto: Vice City for 12 years now and I cannot say that I am bored with it. This game is a proper classic! The storyline, the soundtrack, the memories, fantastic! For a game that was released in 2002 I personally think that it has aged well. If you have not played this game then there is something seriously wrong with you or you have been living in a cave since '02. This was made back when Rockstar cared about gameplay more than appearance. Once again friends, I thank you for taking the time from your busy schedules to read my review. I truly hope I have influenced your opinion of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.Yours in gaming,Dubgame.			"

												This game rocks, as you can build your own urban empire and build revenues! With this game you can almost do anything, as long you don't get busted by the cops that look like Steve Irwin, hehe! Some of the players favourite weapons like the Ninja Sword, Minigun, SPAS-12, MP5-A2 and M4-A1 are included, but no AK-47s, sorry! But you can download a Model Mod to change the Ruger into a AK47.The only thing that I find a bit disturbing, however is the stereotyping involved in Caribbean mob war fights - which some players may find upsetting or distressing.Also there a couple important notes to remember: if you don't want your Criminal Rating Stats to be ruined, don't use the cheats too often. And secondly download the X10 Draw Distance and DirectDraw Fix for this game. Try it!IMPORTANT NOTE: Don't save your saves from the Ice Cream Van Factory nor play with Frame Limiter Off, as those factors could corrupt your saves and Widescreen isn't supported for this Steam Version.http://apg-clan.org/vbdownloads.php?do=download&downloadid=677http://apg-clan.org/vbdownloads.php?do=download&downloadid=779 "

												So you might be asking why review a game that originally came out in 2002/2003? Well to this day it is still my favorite game. Nothing has come close to beating it and i don’t think anything ever will. There’s been a lot of controversy over the years about the Grand Theft Auto games, and their potential effects on children; so, this is probably a bad time to mention that I first played Vice City when I was quite young. But onto why I love the game so much: it’s probably a mixture of nostalgia and obsession. I believe that it would be in my top 5 games that I’ve spent the most time on (I’ve probably beaten it 12 times), and it’s quite ultimately the game I am the most familiar with.One of the more-objectively strong reasons why I love Vice City over the other GTA games is that Tommy Vercetti, as a main character, makes the most sense. It’s out of character for the majority of GTA characters to run around on a rampage. Vercetti is a sandpaper-rough, heartless shell of a man: he only wants to get the money back that was stolen from him, and he’ll work with whoever he can to achieve his goals. Some people may see him as a bit of a shallow character, but I’d rather that over a bad-guy-turned-good, like a lot of the other main characters in the GTA series. It just makes no sense for Niko (from GTA IV) to mow down dozens of pedestrians, when a lot of his dialogue is about the horrors of war back in his homeland, and how he is coming to the US to make himself a new life. Plus he first appears wearing a light blue-green Hawaiian shirt i mean what is there not to love.Much like the cast of characters, the story of Vice City worked so wonderfully because the developers threw it all against the backdrop of the nineteen eighties, which was in itself just a rip roaring time to be alive. At least that’s the impression one gets from games and television. You know, if you ignored the cold war, economic recession and the bad hairstyles. Vice City won in my eyes as it was a straight up gangster story. It certainly helped that it was basically a retelling of Scarface. If you’re going to make an 80s gangster movie there’s no better source material.Now onto the most-subjective reason why I love the game, even more so than pure nostalgia: the radio stations, or more specifically: V Rock. I still have the entire audio file of the station on my computer, and I’d listen to it separate from the game. I listen to it while i’m driving around today so that must count for something. V Rock is still for me the pinnacle of in game music. As someone who wasn’t that into music in my younger days, I can thank V Rock for introducing me to the bands I would still be listening to today. 2 Minutes to Midnight by Iron Maiden, Bark at the Moon from Ozzy,♥♥♥♥♥On Feel The Noize by Quiet Riot, Twisted Sister, Motley Crue and many more. Classic metal at its finest. It was also hosted by everyone’s favourite radio host Lazlow, of Chatterbox fame.This isn’t to say that Vice City is a perfect game, but then again I personally believe that a critical part of loving something is realising that it’s not perfect, and being okay with its faults. The game has some pretty obtrusive shooting controls, because of the early lock-on mechanic. It’s the same sort of issue that the other PS2-era GTAs had. This makes the shooting parts of gameplay quite unnecessarily hard. Not that I dislike a hard game, but I want to at least feel as though I am in control when I am getting the crap shot out of my character. To summarise, Vice City is a great combination of atmosphere, story, characters, and soundtrack. If you’re only familiar with the Grand Theft Auto games with fancy graphics on current-gen consoles, then you really should give Vice City a try. You can thank me later.			"

												One of the best series of games I have ever played in my entire life. The game presents a wonderful story of Tommy Vercetti who framed by his friends goes to jail. Our adventure with main character starts after leaving the prison. The story resembles the movie ""Scarface"". There are many missions, outside the main thread we can perform many side tasks from playing with the guardian of law who must kills the villains , to the distribution of pizza or ""ice cream"".The entire map of the game is a great matched and explore it and look for the secrets hidden on the map gives us many hours of unforgettable adventures. Compared to the previous section, in Vice City we have a choice of more cars and boats, as well as motorcycles and helicopters. For carrying out the missions we get money that we can buy new weapons and houses. In this game, there are plenty of weapons to choose from a baseball bat to a minigun.The Radio Station has a lot of amazing music from 80’s. I have discovered many of greatest songs.The system of save game is well considered. In every house, we can save the progress.I went Vice City 5 times. Never get bored. At the end of the main story I have always tears in the eyes.I recommend this game.11/10 from me.			"

												First of all, I want to say this game is the reason I am a PC gamer.Vice City is based on Miami, which was a major cocaine trans-shipment point for South America at the time. This is further reinforced with its theme of the drug business and crime, as well as the presence of new upper-class businesses and residents in the city, with some of them likely to be funded by the drug business. Vice City is specifically located within the state of Florida.The game seems to keep the '80s atmosphere, which is a very important thing. Tommy Vercetti is the most Vice City badass protagonist, which is ready to kill and destory in order to become a leader. Everything is great about this game. The vehicles, the missions, the atmosphere, the weather... and so on.I could tell you a lot more things, but I don't waste your time anymore, and tell you dirrectly: Buy this now, and enjoy playing a REALLY GOOD game.

												""Welcome to Vice City, 1986. . . .""IntroductionGrand Theft Auto: Vice City. In a sense this is the game turned the franchise from a cult classic, to a game that everyone wanted. Since while in GTA, and GTA II, it was a top based shooter. There was no real story line, and general it was a cult game series. GTA III, it gave you a silent hero based in 2001. You suddenly were able to shoot in a 3-D environment, and had an actual story line. Well here in Vice City, they've take the formula that worked, and added more to it, so let's do it!Story 10/10The idea is you're Thomas Vercetti, a man who has just done 15 years in jail for ""the family"", your sent down south to buy some cocaine and get it back north. Well the deal goes south, and now you owe the 'family' a load of money, and you need the cocaine. As you investigate what happened, and you get your revenge. You'll see how Tommy changes in Vice City, from a hired gun, to something more. What I like about this story line, is that it's believable. Based on what I've found of the era (mid-80's), and the character profile we get of Tommy. Since if someone were thrown into his situation, with his connections. What he becomes is plausible, pending him getting arrested or killed. As a note here to the writers, they could've gone with some very immature humour, but when it does go funny, its done with a sense of class almost.Graphics 9/10I know some people are going to be screaming at me over this, since I gave the graphics a 9 rating over a 10. This game is 12 years old, and yes its aged well. I've seen modem games with worse graphics, at a higher price.Each gun, each car, even key people look unique. However, the problem is there are gaps where you see 'blue', and sometimes the details that separate two cars is so small you need to be the developer to see it. The other problem is running though trees, half the time Tommy is hidden from you. Which means you can't see him, and you see a 'blue' outline around the leafs.Sound & Music 11/10This is not a joke people. I am giving this game a 11/10 for music and sound. Since this is audio perfection. One of the reasons why I bought this game was for the in game radio. Besides the fashion, the radio music & chatter help set the mood for the game. You get an idea of what it was like to be in the 1980's. Where the cold war wasn't over yet, or how rap music was brand new. This is where you're going to get the real bang for your gaming dollar. Since I admit it, there are times I just load up the game, slap on a station as I do something else on my PC.Besides the music, you can listen to how a gun fires and you've got a good idea of what's being fired at you. Maybe you can't tell the difference between two Semi-automatics. However, if someone close to you is firing a pistol, and the guy next to him is using a shot gun. You can tell the difference, and when you're outgunned, that kind of information is handy.Game play 8/10I've got a few complains about the actual game engine per say. Sometimes the game lags for a few seconds when swapping radio stations, or exiting a vehicle. Other times, you can't see a 'target' circle on someone you're simpering, and when you pop off the shot it works. Who can forget that when firing from a vehicle, how there is no targeting circle. Its all guess and check. With the exception of when you're being driven by someone else.Now the beautiful part of this engine is how you've got to account for something moving. Most games if you're moving, you aim, you fire, you hit. In This game, you need to account for the motion of yourself, or the target, and sometimes both. The controls that are used are used in almost every game so the learning curve is not a long one.9/10			"

												So I have played through the story of this game 70+ times on Playstation 2. (i was counting I lost count after the 70th time). I own 3 different copies for ps2, Two copies for xbox original, 2 physical release copies for pc, I have it for android, and now I have it for steam. I have put hundreds of hours into this game if not thousands, this is easily one of my most played games of all time. This is the type of game I can pick up and start playing at any given time.I love everything about the story and the gameplay, lets not forget about that award winning soundtrack. It was amazing for its time, I still think it is great to play today. If you have the pc version make sure you check out the multiplayer mod for it https://vc-mp.org . its not perfect but its a great little time killer. If you can 100% complettion this game you are master at gaming. I very highly recommend this game to anybody especially if you are a fan of the Grand Theft Auto series. "

I put so many hours into the PS2 version and I'm surprised at how many more hours I have put into it on Steam. The radio is fantastic, driving around and causing havoc is still fun. The shooting mechanics are rough and can make some missions frustrating, but I found things very manageable with 150 armour or health. My patience for games isnt what it used to be but I'm still having fun working towards 100% completion on this one.			"

												Another classic game I wanted to go back to one last time. It definitely aged quite a bit since the last time I played it, and playing it right after GTA V probably had a little to do with that. Still, the gameplay is as fun as I remember, and the soundtrack is what made the many memories I have of this game. Its a pretty quick and fun game. Definitely a classic and belongs in everything enthusiasts library.			"

												Good ol Vice City...This game in my own personal opinion is the greatest GTA title in the whole series. The Atmosphere alone tramples any GTA game past or present, the music, the characters, the setting, the story, the protaginist, the warm beaches, it's all wonderful. Tommy Vercetti is hands down the best character made by Rockstar. His story is actually believable too, not absolutley ridiculous and horrid like GTA 5's. And damn was the gore fun. Blowing off heads and limbs with your Sniper or Shottie was awesome. Driving around the warm streets of Vice City on a motorcycle or in a nice convertable never fails to bring endless joy to my heart. Really hope Rockstar comes back to Vice City and Tommy in the future, not to mention learn how to make good story once more. 10/10, this game is forever fantastic.			"

""Funny how?""Full of pop culture charm, sarcasm and blaring synthesisers, Rockstar's love letter to the likes of Goodfellas, Boogie Nights and Scarface really reflects the mastery of Vice City and the game's success. Voiced by none other than Ray ""Henry freakin' Hill"" Liotta, your journey as Tommy Vercetti through this '80s odyssey and crazed sea of neon lights, big hair and bright clothing features some of the best content that the GTA series has to offer.One of the reasons Rockstar Games continues to set and then decisively smash the standard for open-world wish fulfilment is because of just how brilliant their games are. Boasting an intellectual depth that far exceeds its critics, the GTA series in particular is yet to be equalled in humour and outright cynicism. I wouldn't be lying when saying that Rockstar continues to deliver some of the most relentlessly funny and cutting wit that's out there. I'll often stop playing to just listen and laugh at the latest crack at modern society. When there's better writing for radio station advertisements than the majority of real life television and cinema, it really shows just how great this series is. That's not to say that gameplay doesn't have something to do with it. The sheer amount of things to do, missions to complete and areas to explore here is astronomical, as is the case for the rest of the series. If you're looking for something to kill time with, then look no further. Old-school GTA has got you covered.Sure, the visuals have certainly aged, featuring blocky character models and low-res textures, but the rest of the game remains timeless. I’d wager that even the most stubborn of graphics diehards would soon become absorbed by the otherwise top-notch quality. With a tonne of varied environments and satisfying gameplay to boot, Vice City is just as good as it's modern counterparts. In the pre-San Andreas and GTA V world, there wasn't that much on offer in terms of the games we take for granted today, with most of the popular and ambitious titles back then confined mainly to the fantasy/role-playing market or the occasional narrative-driven FPS. Like the early days of cinema, crime was seen as taboo and highly controversial but - thankfully - titles such as GTA and Manhunt were set to change that, regardless of the backlash. A significant departure from the rather empty feel of GTA III, Vice City delivers yet again on what you'd expect from the series. The few noticeable flaws were mainly down to clipping or the occasional bug or glitch but nothing major. It's held up really well and remains popular for a reason. Whether stealing a tank from the military or attacking a fortress with a helicopter-mounted machinegun; from trying to hold out against the cops to being caught in a (relatively) high speed chase after a buggy while riding a bike with a blown-out tyre, this has it all. Better still? Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five’s ‘The Message’ was blasting all the while over the radio.Good times. All that and more awaits in Vice City. "

												5/5 Most of my playtime with GTA Vice City has been with the physical disc version (DVD ROM) and PS2 version. So my Steam stats don't reflect all of my experience with this game.PROS:+One of the funnest open-world/sandbox games ever made.+HUGE and diverse environment to explore!+Fully interactive environment.+Great variety in missions, both story based and side jobs.+Diverse choices of vehicles, weapons, and character skins.+Great story. On par with Martin Scorsese films, with a good dose of pop culture satire.+Awesome soundtrack, reflecting the 1980s setting of the story.+Memorable characters with excellent voice acting.+Modest hardware requirements: any PC built after 2002 or Mac built after 2008 should be able to run GTA Vice City.+Gamepad support, both Direct Input (Logitech/PS3/generic) and Xinput (360).+Windows and Mac versions included.CONS:-6th gen (PS2 era) graphics will put off graphics snobs.-No multiplayer.

												Damn, what a game! Personally, this one is my favorite over GTA 2, 3 or 4, mostly because of all this neon glowing bloom, expensive cars and bikes, and beautiful sunsets :). +Visuals: Back in 2003 this game was BEAUTIFUL, and still looks good for me, no matter what :) Each GTA is unique in its own way, and this one is just COOL, at least 20% cooler than other parts.+Soundwork: great radio stations!+Gameplay: A lot of arcade missions, a lot of bike racing stuff, a lot of money to waste on hookers, and a lot of side jobs to keep yourself entertained:0 You can even hose people down when you are in the fire truck. Enjoyable all around, really cool game, yeh. Interesting Campaign as well.Personally I would be happy if someday Rockstar add steam cards to this one so you could get a fancy wallpaper from 2003 :)p.s. small bonushttps://coub.com/view/d1u1u "

												Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is loosely modeled after Miami, Florida. You play as Tommy Vercetti, a Mafia hitman released from prison who returns to Vice City and builds a criminal empire. The soundtrack fit perfectly for the era the game was set in and was just a great mix of music. While the graphics are considered outdated by today's standards, Vice City was and remains one of my favorites in the series for the nostalgia factor. Originally released in 2002 on the PS2, and later in 2003 for Windows, it was considered to be the best selling video game of all time on the PS2. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City was my very first introduction into the GTA Series. Back in 2004 or 2005, I had just gotten the new PS3 with the emotion chip, so I was able to play most playstation 2 games. There was a lot of controversy around Vice City at the time for the graphic violence and hidden sex scenes and everyone was anticipating the release of San Andreas, so I picked it up to see what the fuss was about. I must have played this game for days on end, it was such a blast. If you love the GTA Series, this is worth playing through at least once.			"

												I rarely wrote reviews to games. Because I can't really give out points that nobody said already.But I'm going to do it anyway.First off this game is brilliant. The atmosphere perfectly captures the 80's. It's like I'm in a 80's film. Yes Atmosphere is really what made this game great. Yes. However that's not the only thing that's great. It also has great soundtracks and fun mini games. What more could you ask for?Plus this is the first game I have ever played in my life. It made me into gamer. However this game does have flaws. The main one for me is that the game only runs when it feels like it. I had a tough time trying to make it work. And finally the flying controls are crooked beyond all belief but not as worse as San Andreas. (That's a story for another day)In conclusion this game is great. I recommend it. Buy it.			"

												Now, gamers and gentlemen, what you see here right now is ""GTA: Vice City"", one of the world's most epic PC game mankind ever created. The game's a open-world; you could go out and massacre everybody, destroy gangs, steal cars, and call in the FBI and the army and fight till the death. One of the new features is building investments, which is also a great feature that teaches you to stop wasting money on chicks and to get your head into the game. Great graphics for 2003 as well as the game engine. The story's is f*cking good; it's GTA. A 10 out of 10!			"

												GRAND THEFT AUTO: VICE CITYThe story of a real soldierUnlike his shiftless brother who did time for selling drugs, Victor Vance until the last moment tried to be in trouble with the law. He even went to the army, to obtain government protection, knowledge and money, which always lacked. But even this did not help him to avoid bad influence: doing another ""civil"" job of his commander, he violated the Charter and in a moment was outside the gate of military garrison.The prospect of washing the nights dishes in the restaurants did not suit him, so the route remained single — hires apprentices to local gangsters. But how can you take seriously these clowns? The first lives in the port hangar and drunken, and the second rat and a misogynist, and a third for hours talking about their genitals. The last straw was returned from prison lance caught shaped jerk: he immediately began does business behind Vick and communicate with corrupt police. Long endure such an environment was impossible — I had to take the command in his hands.In the brothel — in a helicopterVice city eighty-fourth is a reduced copy of Moscow of the early nineties, when the ""white"" business did not exist in principle, but the negotiations much to decide the fists and ""trunks"". Therefore, to build their own criminal Empire have literally brick by brick. Victor goes to the neighboring areas, captures the building and makes them his property, after having disposed of the former owners.After several hours of heavy activity, he becomes owner of several brothels and gangster dens and pairs of points on the sale of drugs, bringing considerable income. The process is no less amazing than the result — I feel like a young entrepreneur who works like a bee from morning till evening. And no matter what it does not built kindergartens and hospitals — market laws are the same for all undertakings.No, crazy action when porting from one platform to another turned into an economic simulator. Just in Rockstar's once dared to change some well-established principles, and the most striking example — a system of unarmed combat. If earlier the clothes that were only stupid to thrash arms and legs, Vic is able to conduct suffocating grappling and lock techniques of the opponent (due to military training?). Traditionally, when the desire on fighting and shooting may be time to close my eyes and instead, steal a fancy convertible, going to the waterfront to admire the red-orange sunsets, ride a jet ski on the water channel or to look at the city from the helicopter.So good games under the brand name Grand Theft Auto that are not forced to adhere to a strictly defined lines of conduct. Vice City stories respects tradition and relies heavily on the attention of the public familiar with the series. Terse and business Victor fits perfectly into the role of the godfather of the city, continuing the tradition of predecessors: he can work before losing momentum and in a big way to relax. Sorry, will shoot him in the Prime of life at the peak of fame. But the writers released him two years he will hold in his pleasure.The programmers at Rockstar Leeds to make the most of outdated engine everything: the picture quality here is even higher than in the original Vice City for the PlayStation 2. Even the wheels of the machines of steel volume, explosions are more colorful, and the animation movements are smooth and natural. Local radio stations for any musical taste and still pleased with the work of competent DJs. The rest of Vice city is mostly quiet and calm, as befits the relaxed southern city. Only the sound of gunfire and sirens occasionally break this idyll. The next ""Stories"" turned out to be perfectly optimized for the features of the platform: helicopters obediently ""float"" in response to the command, shooting at enemies easier mode avtopritselivaniya, and to steer the car even just at high speed. If here and there an accident, mostly the fault of other road users. Some missions seem impenetrable and can only be after a dozen fruitless attempts, however, after mastering all the intricacies of the task management clicking like nuts. However, neither one of them is not like another — and have the crowd of bandits to the ground to lay, and seniors home to deliver. A true Paradise for the budding gangster. This is not a standalone project, and another story on the life of gangsters that fit into the events of the series. Not just a game but a real world in which you want to return again and again.			"

												""And I ran, I ran so far away. I just ran, I ran all night and day. I couldn't get away."" Vice City has it's charm in being set in the 80's. Everything you would expect from that timeline has managed to find it's way here: neon lights, hawaiian shirts, synthwave, everyone being doped up, etc. It looks great aesthetically. Riding a motorcycle and listening to 80's tunes with palm trees in the background is always enjoyable, including the 80's filter that was originally on the ps2 that helps give it a more authentic experience (it can be downloaded on pc with mods). However, after playing this for so long this title feels lacking especially when compared to the other entries. The map is very small and you can drive around Malibu in around 2 minutes. There aren't much attractions other than a dance club and the beach. The characters aren't that interesting and more-so try to fit the 80's stereotypes. Most missions are dull, they include tasks like checkpoints, driving around an 80's rock & roll band or killing someone at a golf course. It makes the character feel like a chauffeur, and the missions tend to have more style than substance. Also, the plot takes the character from faction to faction without trying to bring together a world with interrelated characters and stories, concluding to a rushed ending that comes together sloppily. It's still fun due to nostalgia and if the neon lights aren't a deterrence than Vice City should be enjoyable.			"

												There's just something about Vice City that makes me love it, could it be wildly ignorant nostalgia, the phenomenal soundtrack featuring perhaps my favourite song of all time, the crazy cast of memorable characters, or even the many homages to 80's culture. It really is a mystery, but what isn't a mystery is the fact that this is one of the best Grand Theft Auto games to date. I honestly could not recommend this instalment more.			"

												My favorite game in the franchise. Instead of silent protagonist Claude, you are now playing as Tommy Vercetti, charismatic member of Italian Mafia, who gets out of prison after serving 15 years for multiple killings. Soon enough he gets involved in a drug deal gone wrong and determines to find out who was behind it while building his own criminal empire.Setting is moved from cold streets of Liberty City to more relaxed Vice City which is based on Miami. References to 80's culture are numerous - disco music, pastel suits, styled cars. The American crack epidemic, drug trafficking and organized crime that followed it are heavily represented in the game, which also draws inspiration from many movies and tv series such as Miami Vice, Scarface, Carlito's Way, Godfather and many others. I will mention some examples:Retired colonel from Central America and drug trafficker Juan Cortez - parody of Manuel Noriega, Panama dictator and major player in drug trafficking during 80's.Drug baron Ricardo Diaz may be influenced by Frank Lopez, character from Scarface who happens to be played by late Robert Loggia who did voice acting for Ray Machowski, corrupt police officer in GTA 3. Diaz's mansion is very similar to Montana's from the same movie. Betrayal and the same clothes also add to the full picture. Interesting thing is that he is voiced by Luis Guzmán who played Gonzalo Rodríguez Gacha, drug trafficker and one of the leaders of the notorious Medellín Cartel in Netflix original series Narcos. Diaz's physical resemblance and temper to him are rather substantial.Ken Rosenberg's appearance and behaviour are nearly identical to David Kleinfeld, who was played by Sean Penn in Carlito's Way.Lance Vance is voiced by Philip Michael Thomas who played Ricardo Tubbs in Miami Vice, which heavily influenced Vice City.Tommy Vercetti was inspired by Tony Montana from Scarface. Memorable shootout scene was also incorporated.Last but not least there is Escobar International Airport, no need to say anything about that one.Game introduces bikes which are way more fun to drive than standard cars and will probably become your first choice in exploring the city. Later you get access to helicopters which are easy to control and are much better solution when you need a quick way to certain place, or you just want better view of the city. Those who prefer adventures on the sea are not forgotten, you can also drive boats.Major gangs in VC are Cubans, Haitians, Vice City Bikers and members of Forelli Crime Family. All of side activites from GTA 3 are also present here. Newly introduced are assets purchases. They include strip club, taxi company, film studio, dance club, printing works, car showroom, ice cream factory and boatyard. Each of them has a number of missions attached, and once all of them are complete a given property will begin generating an ongoing income.There is nine radio stations in the game - on seven of them you will listen great collection of licensed music, while talk shows that contain lots of satire are on remaining two. Big step was made compared to previous title in quantity of material - there is over 10 hours of it compared to 3.5h in GTA 3.Voice actors lineup and their performance is phenomenal; Ray Liotta, Tom Sizemore, Burt Reynolds, William Fichtner, Dennis Hopper and Danny Trejo are present among many others. One person that you certainly don't expect is porn actress Jenna Jameson, who gives voice to appropriately named character Candy Suxxx.Like its predecessor, Vice City was given a lot of GOTY awards and achieved huge commercial success, over 20 million sold copies speaks for itself. I really liked main character, and hope that Rockstar will bring him and Vice City setting back in the future.			"

Since you've probably heard tales about it's amazing soundtrack of 80s Hair Metal and glamourous open world city. But your not liable to listen to me, and chances are if your reading this you probably already own it.			"

												GTA Vice City, a game created by Rockstar North (Edinburgh, Scotland), which was released a year after the release of GTA III, on October 2002 for the PS2, and later ported to PC in May 2003.StoryThis time around, the game was based in Vice City, which resembles Miami.You are playing as Tony, a member of the Forelli Family, which is based in Liberty City. The Don decided to expand its borders, so they give you huge ton of money and send you to Vice City to make a deal. Unfortunately, you get ambushed. All the money is lost and now you have to find a way to pay them back.GTA Vice City solved all the issues that the 3rd one had. They doubled the amount of vehicles[gta.wikia.com], songs in radio stations and weapons. They even added flyable helicopters and a plane to the game.The solved the issues with gangs being hostile towards you. For those that don't remember, 5 out of 7 gangs would be hostile towards you by the end of the game in GTA 3. It became really annoying considering that some gangs had shotguns which could blow up your car in 2 shots. Well, in Vice City, there would be only 1 gang that would be hostile to you.The plot itself is also very enjoyable, unlike GTA 3. It has a very cool feel to it, as if i am in some Al Pacino movie. Just watch a few minutes of it and you may understand why.

			UPDATED VERSIONS BELOW! Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - PS4 Emulation = https://youtu.be/fCXsjBSSgcA Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - 10 Year Anniversary = https://youtu.be/lRmyVTcBJQg Grand Theft Auto...		

Comparison to its predecessor - GTA IIIThey added more game mechanics. You could damage cars with melee weapons, shoot the tires (the cops would even have spiked strips during chases), and now you are able to shoot through windows of a car, giving you the ability to kill the driver.They added the ability to wear outfits (some areas, like the police station can only be accessed with such uniforms).They added motorcycles.They added assets and safehouses which can be bought. Assets would have a set of missions that if you complete, you would get profit from. Safehouses would allows you to save your game and store additional cars in the garage. GTA III had only 3 safehouses, which are unlocked as you progress through the story. Well in Vice City, you get 9.They also added a few helicopters, and a plane that was actually flyable this time.The amount of weapons increased, usually each weapon tier would give you a choice of about 3 weapons. But the biggest change was the addition of melee weapons. Unlike GTA III, where you only had a baseball bat, in Vice City you get to play with katanas, chainsaws, screwdrivers, machetes, golf clubs and so on.Unlike GTA 3, Vice City featured a full map that you could view, and icons were visible throughout the whole game.They added the ability to crouch. Most of the time i see some one playing older GTAs, most of them never use that mechanic. Well, let me clear some things out for you. Most objects in GTA, even cars, are made that way, so that when the player crouches, it fully covers him. But when you are starting the firing animation, your character will rise a bit above his cover. So in a way, this is kind of like the Gears of War cover system.Now most people don't understand the importance of this mechanic. If you played GTA III, you probably know that there weren't a lot of shootouts. Most of the game, you are using your cars for your missions. Well, the crouching mechanic changed that, making at least 50% of game involve shootouts.If you really planning on completing every mission in the game, you need to learn to take cover.Do i recommend it?Well, this is probably the only game that is set in the 80's period. The songs in the radio, the cars, the city itself - the game is just so good at capturing the feel of the 80s. This is definitely a gem.As always, the PC port suffers with the same issues as in GTA III. Mouse problems and FPS locked to 30. Most glitches can be fixed with SilentPatch, which i suggest you install before playing.Other than that, this is the 2nd game of the GTA III era, which are all connected. And chronologically, plot wise, they are set in this order:1986 - Vice City1992 - San Andreas2001 - GTA III			"

												This game was the pinnacle of gaming for the 6th generation and has one of the best soundtracks ever. Only problem i hate about this game is that you're surrounded by water and you can't swim. Vice City has the best protaganist in the GTA series because Tommy Vercetti is such a psychotic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and has the best outfit of all the protags. That 80's nostalgic feel is what really makes this game shine and is perfect for a GTA title with the environment and music. I'd say this is my favorite GTA game because of its tight controls and its perfect story of cloning scarface and setting of beautiful Miami with the best soundtrack of 80s music with classic hits like ""99 Luftballons"", ""Out of Touch"" and ""Japanese Boy"". I never wanted to turn my radio off once the entire game because the soundtrack is so good. VIDEO KILLED THE RADIO  STAR! A masterpiece in gaming, it is worth every minute playing and very rewarding.DAD NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR YOUR STUPID VIETNAM STORIES!I, I LIVE AMONG THE CREATURES OF THE NIGHTI HAVEN'T GOT THE WILL TO TRY AND FIGHTAGAINST A NEW TOMORROW, SO I GUESS I'LL JUST BELIEVE ITTHAT TOMORROW NEVER COMESA SAFE NIGHT, I'M LIVING IN THE FOREST OF MY DREAMI KNOW THE NIGHT IS NOT AS IT WOULD SEEMI MUST BELIEVE IN SOMETHING, SO I'LL MAKE MYSELF BELIEVE ITTHAT THIS NIGHT WILL NEVER GOOH-OH-OH, OH-OH-OH, OH-OH-OH, OH-OH-OH "

												Gonna keep this short and sweet:Plenty of great radio stations (80's pop, VCPR with Maurice Chavez, rock, etc) and the ability to use your own mp3s, as well.Really nice arcade-y vehicle handling and the introduction of motorcycles to the series. Feels great hitting a ramp while popping a wheelie on a PCJ-600 or off-roading on a Sanchez.Voice acting and script is a great cheesefest of humor and 80's mob movie cliches.Plenty of side-stuff to do if you don't feel like furthering the main story.Great game to load up just to ride around for a few minutes listening to the radio, finding secret ramps/packages, and just causing havok in general.Just overall an awesome game that I keep finding myself going back to whenever I get bored or want some mindless entertainment.

												Vice City is my personal favorite of all the GTAs and all 'round my favorite game of all time, and listen to me as I tell you why...  Back when all I had was a teeny-tiny, weak and slimy laptop, I would wait for school to end just so I could go home and visit the beautiful Vice City. During cold winters there would be nothing warmer than loadin' up my game and running 'round the beach, soaring the skies with a ""Zimmer"" or ruling the streets with a ""Cheetah""...  Vice City is a game done right! It doesn't seek to be more than it needs to be, as in: the story is perfect, to simply put it: nothing more - nothing less, the combat isn't as good compared to what games we have nowadays, but at least *I* had a hell of a time blasting ruthless gangsters with an Uzi from the window of my car, setting up bombs in a van and jumping out, as it would rush to the unexpecting law-breakers and go KA-BOOM! or going on a rampage and decapitating four men at a time with a single swing of the sword!  Vice city also lets you get into the whole island-resort thing by giving you access to boats & yachts with which you can feel the king of the island as you ride the waves with great triumph! You can also feel the city's night life as the neon lights fill the streets on evenings and shine bright all night long!  My advice to those who lost all hope of going on a warm vacation, to those who wish to be where the sun shines in the middle of winter: play Vice City, and aaall your dreams will come true!			"

												Played this recently on pc after playing it on the xbox in the good old days. Like GTA3, this game has replayability that the more modern GTAs just don't have. The main story is just long enough not to get boring and although there are a host of side missions they do not become overbearing or repetitive. The setting is the real star with the gorgeous weather efffect, interesting characters,  musical gems, and funny dialogue. o#only cons are the mapping of the keys to controller is imperfect, especially with regards to the gun fights and the buying of assets serve very little purpose especially if they completed late in the game. Defintely 9/10 for me.			"

												This is one of those timeless games that will always fit in.Back then, it was so cool and calm and classic 80's disco. It was known worldwide as the best GTA in the series until San Andreas proceeded it - and even today, people haven't forgotten about it.Today, it's praised by many for its A E S T H E T I C delivery and atmosphere. It feeds directly into the culture of palm trees, neon signage, cocktail bars, beach side resorts and general 80's coastal America - and of course, vice.Whether you're into Wave or not, it doesn't matter, because this is classic GTA - classic Rockstar.

												A sure-fire classic. It has great graphics, great music, fanatical voice talent, an intelligent plot, dynamic gameplay and a universe of models that will be hard to match.Vice City doesn't improve much on the few shortcomings of its predecessor. Fortunately, it doesn't have to.More interiors in Vice City would be welcome, but the city is huge with plenty of unique terrain. It's a little disappointing that jetliners and more planes aren't available, but the thrill of flying the Hunter and going on multiple Vigilante missions makes up for it.Vice City is one of those rare games that effortlessly combines atmosphere, engaging gameplay, and great graphics and sound to make a truly unique gaming experience.

												I loved this game, I must have several hundred hours on it, from playing it back in the day.However, the steam version is a headache and then some. Here’s some of the several troubleshooting issues you’ll have to go through.DirectPlay. Firstly, you’ll have to enable this, the path is Control Panel > Programs and Feature > Turn Windows features on or off > Legacy Components > Direct Play.Next, it’s not compatible with your OS unless your running 98 or XP, if so, you have more issues to worry about. Go to compatibility, select Windows 98, also, reduce the colour mode, along with the bits, alongside applying it to run in 640 x 480 resolution. Think you’re done? Nope. You just applied for a part time job as a computer technician. Next issue, it will ask you to insert the CD. That’s right, the digital copy you purchased, most likely for the main reason of having easy access to a childhood game, will ask you for a CD. So, the main way you’ll be able to resolve this is if you delete the audio folder in your steam apps, and replacing it with the CD versions audio folder, thankfully, I kept my CD for this part, if not, you have to illegally torrent the game, but if you do so, you won’t have the fun of troubleshooting. Don’t worry, it gets better, the game can now load and you can play it, however, the audio will not be compatible with the game itself, so you won’t hear anything. No awesome 80s music or Haitians dying in the streets. The final step, refund this mess that steam provided to you, with no warnings or disclaimers and throw that CD that you kept in perfect condition for the last 14 years at the wall.			"

												Vice City took everything that made GTA III good and made it better, while also adding in some (now basic) features that were absent in GTA III (most notably the lack of a map in GTA III). The game is pure style and is an homage to everything 80's and gangster. while it hasn't quite ages the best, it has aged better than III due to a better art direction. also the voice acting in the game is top notch (in my opinion) and i freaking love Ray Liotta as Tommy Vercetti			"

												I dont care about old graphics, i dont care about bigger and better maps in later games, i dont care about more refined gameplay. This is my favorite GTA of all time. Vice City is a city of dreams and crime. With unforgettable characters, challenging missions(yes, Demolition man, can do it any time and still win))) and warm and sunny city. If you dont mind old graphics, then go ahead, buy it. You wont be dissapointed. A MUST HAVE for anyone self-respecting GTA fan))			"

This game had everything, a great engine (way better than GTAIII), lots of cool gameplay features and missions and excellent, (and I mean EXCELLENT) music. I put so many hours into this game, I can't believe it. I still think it was all worth it, so that's saying a lot about this game. Play it and never stop.

												After 2001's GTA III, Rockstar Games decided the next venue that we should visit in 2002 was Vice City. And damn! They delivered. GTA: Vice City was an extremely fun game which was built over the strengths of its previous installment but now setting the clock back to the 1980's! This change in the period of time allowed the developers to play more with the satirical comments and dark humour the series is known for. From Scarface to Miami Vice, from the drug trafficking to the strong presence of Cuban and Haitian gangs after the increase of immigration of people to Miami (I mean Vice City) It is all there. True to the series, the freedom is sort of there, but as well as it's 2001 counterpart you have to advance through the story missions to unlock the rest of the map. Either way, the city is beautifully rendered even when the technology which created this map is 14 years old! Nonetheless, the freedom to cause mayhem is there and nothing will stop you to blow some cars and use some cheats to get your weapon kits! Did you pack your swimsuit? Vice City awaits! 9/10Buy it, play it and don't regret it.			"

												Vice City is the replica of the real-world Miami Vice. This game is much, much more coloured and full of life then it's predecessor.  The atmosphere is just stunning, it's easy to see how much quality and detail is packed in, the music the cars, the characters - everything about it is just stunning, even today.And while you may have played it and you know what i'm talking about, it just never gets old to get back to it, steal a tank, run around the city and destroy everything. Just as any GTA game, the sheer amount of madness you can do is impressive. "

												Having trouble with the game? Turn your frame limiter ON! It fixes about 8/10 of the common bugs.Grand Theft Auto: Vice CityVice City is a game from my younger years. I originally bought the game in a special edition set on a CD-disk. Along with a manual and a map of the Vice City. Though i never really got into the missions as a kid, i now decided to boot Vice City again and play the storyline on stream.I can say that Vice City has it's good and bad moments. Good moments as in the gameplay, the story and that pure feeling. Bad moments as in the sometimes poor performance, the bugs and the glitches.I was really caught into the story and have never inserted a single cheat. I spend more than 20+ hours on the game and managed to complete the game with all assets completed(which are side-missions) and had found 90/100 hidden packages. The hidden packages are rewarding and so are the missions. As you play you slowly become more powerful by the mission, yet you do quite some errands but fair is fair, most missions are uniqie, fun and challenging. Even though there is no difficulty,  I managed to struggle with the game for quite some times.The most annoying thing i experienced was the fact that people and vehicles literally vanish or appear out of thin air if you turn around. Scary it was not, annoying it was. Park your car, walk into an alley... come back and 'poof' your car is gone.Yet Rockstar is Rockstar and Rockstar wouldn't be Rockstar if they weren't adding easter eggs and those little secrets, mysteries and theories which just make me melt. During my game i have found quite some easter eggs. Not gonna share or spoil but trust me when i say that they are worth a chuckle and smile.I have played the game without cheats or spoilers and managed to get and take the most out of the game.I can happily recommend the game. It's one of the 'better' Grand Theft Auto games out there and is with that said quite a jewel. Just make sure you have your frame limiter turned on. It literally affects everything. Handling, the speed of vehicles (especially ships ) and much more.Oh and the music is gold. It will help you get that feeling i mentioned earlier!			"

												GTA: Vice City is a tremendous addition to the GTA series.Find yourself in a city full of riches, women in bikinis and fast cars!! This gangsta's paradise is the second 3rd person sandbox open world game of the franchise and it has lots of improvements to offer after GTA3 was out.Your main character is now voiced offering a great set of cinematic cutscenes on every mission that set a completelly new beginning on the sandbox mafia genre games.The humor levels are even more ridiculous now. From the characters down to the radio commercials. There are graphical and animation improvements (windows can brake, nicer explosions, better damage animations) and game play changes (you can now drive motorbokes, boats and planes and copters!). There's a better weapon variety and missions now start to include expanding mechanisms and better side quests!There's also more sexiness around, everywhere. More violence, more abd funnier vulgar language, more vehicle, more of everything.Only one con: you still can't swim :PRecommended? HELL YEAH IT IS. This is an addition a GTA collection should never be missing!No matter how old it is, if you haven't, play this game now!			"

												Miami Vice... uhh... I mean Vice City is a great game. I've always been a fan of the first generation of GTA's, but Vice City is by far my most favorite GTA. I've played this over and over again back in 2003 and now in 2017 it's still fun to play. The location, the colorful buildings and cars make it a great game to just cruise in your car and enjoy the view.I love that it's taking place in the 80s. It's like walking into the Miami Vice set, but now you can control the main character (Tommy Vercetti), who's voiced by Ray Liotta. Tubbs (Philip Michael Thomas) is the voice of Lance Vance, and the list goes on with famous actors like Burt Reynolds, William Fichtner, Luis Guzmán, and many more! I don't think GTA ever had a greater voice actor cast and I don't think they ever will again.The gameplay is also very good, with enough action, missions, and mini games, but you can also just cruise through the city and do whatever you want. Anyways, if you like the 80s and/or Miami Vice this is a must-have game to play! "

												Tommy Vercetti, a loyal former member of the Forelli Family, has just been released in 1986, serving 15 years for killing 11 men in the Harwood District of Liberty City in early 1971, earning him the nickname The Harwood Butcher.[3] Tommy's old boss, Sonny Forelli, fears that Tommy's presence in Liberty City will heighten tensions between the other Liberty City families and bring unwanted attention to his organisation's criminal activities.[4]To prevent this from happening, Sonny ostensibly promotes Tommy to a capo and sends him to Vice City under the guardianship of a crooked lawyer and Sonny's contact Ken Rosenberg to act as their buyer for a series of cocaine deals for Sonny, whose interest is to expand his family activities down the South and to overrun the Liberty drug market with the high-end cocaine from Vice City, hoping to create a monopoly on the Liberty City drug ring to establish the Forelli Crime Family on the top.[5]Soon, Tommy and his bodyguards are awaited at the Escobar International Airport by Ken, who gives them an info about the deal and takes them to the docks, where they are awaited by the Vance Crime Family, prominent drug kingpins of Vice City led by Victor Vance, who arrive in the chopper with Diaz. As they settle the deal, they are ambushed by several armed and masked men, who kill Victor and Tommy's bodyguards. Tommy narrowly escapes with Ken from the docks, and as a result, he ultimately loses both Forelli's money and the cocaine in the process. Ken drives to his office, while Tommy returns to his hotel.[6]When Tommy informs Sonny of the ambush, Sonny loses his temper and threatens Tommy with the consequences of attempting to cheat the Mafia. Tommy promises to retrieve the money and the cocaine and kill whoever was responsible for the ambush.[7] Towards this end, Tommy meets up again with Ken at his office, who leads Tommy to retired Colonel and mid-level drug dealer named Juan Garcia Cortez, who was Victor Vance's contact and who organised the deal between the Vances and the Forellis. Cortez expresses regret about Tommy's bad deal and promises that his own lines of inquiry are being made to find out who masterminded the ambush plot. Tommy also meets Cortez's daughter Mercedes, who becomes Tommy's confidante shortly thereafter.While Tommy waits for the outcome of Cortez's investigation, he meets cocky 21-year old British record producer Kent Paul, real estate mogul Avery Carrington, and a mysterious man, who introduces himself as Lance Vance, younger brother of Victor and the underboss of the now-defunct Vance Crime Family, who wants revenge for the death of his brother and also wants the Vance Crime Family back on the map.[8]As time passes, Tommy befriends Cortez and begins to do regular work for him as an errand boy and hitman. On one such job, Tommy is called in with Lance to protect the deal of a drug baron named Ricardo Diaz during a deal with the Cubans, looking to buy some high-end cocaine. During the deal, Diaz is ambushed by a gang of Haitians, but Tommy is able to kill them and save the deal, as well as Diaz's life. Consequently, Diaz begins hiring Tommy for his own agenda. Tommy takes this work because it pays well, in spite of his distaste for Diaz. On another errand for Cortez, he plans to meet a French courier to retrieve missile chips stolen from the French government. The deal is ambushed by several French agents and Tommy later kills the courier, who fled the ambush with the chips, retrieving the items.Tommy learns from Cortez that Cortez's own lieutenant, Gonzalez, was partially responsible for the ambush on Tommy's cocaine deal since he is the only person besides Cortez to know about the deal, and Cortez asks Tommy to kill Gonzalez as a favour, since he was a man who he did distrust and was working behind his back. Afterwards, Cortez voices his suspicion that Diaz might have been behind the ambush. Tommy initially continues the status quo to prepare for his attack, but his hand is forced when Lance attempts to take revenge by himself and fails, forcing Tommy to rush across the city and rescue him from the junkyard in which he is held. With the die cast, the two move quickly to raid Diaz's mansion and execute Diaz. With Diaz dead, and Colonel Cortez fleeing the country to escape the French, the established drug empires in Vice City quickly crumble and Tommy and Lance personally take over, becoming Vice City's drug kingpins.Tommy becomes the head of his own organisation, the Vercetti Crime Family, distancing himself from the Forelli Family and Liberty City and more interested in personally controlling Vice City than being Forelli's puppet. But the more powerful and rich Tommy gets, the more Lance begins to exhibit paranoia and sociopathic behaviours, to the point that he begins to abuse his own bodyguards and constantly calls Tommy in states of hysteria, losing his mind over being just a powerless second-in-command as he was under his brother for the past 2 years. Tommy begins to suspect that Lance is up to something.Tommy makes alliance with Umberto Robina's Cubans against Auntie Poulet's Haitians, even though he is at the same time hypnotised by Poulet's voodoo into helping the Haitians as well. However, Tommy and Poulet part ways Tommy and the Cubans sneak explosives into the Haitian drug factory disguised in Haitian gang cars and blow it up, effectively ending the conflict and putting the Haitians out of business, enabling the Cubans to take over Little Havana. Umberto then becomes Tommy's partner. He also becomes friends with Big Mitch Baker, a leader of the biker gang and a Vietnam veteran, with both the bikers and the Cubans becoming protectors of Vercetti family business.As his drug business expands, Tommy buys assets in nearly bankrupt companies such as a car lot named Sunshine Autos, a cab depot Kaufmann Cabs, a popular night club called The Malibu, a local boathouse, a print shop, Print Works, an ice-cream company, and an adult film company, all of which he turns back into competitive businesses. He also becomes a personal bodyguard to glam metal band Love Fist, and pulls a major bank heist. He starts to control almost all the assets and ties of Vice City: Sunshine Autos as a chop shop, Kaufmann Cabs for money laundering, The Malibu Club for dispatching drugs, the ice-cream company for the production of drugs and the film company to control the underground movie scene.Eventually, the Forelli family discovers that Tommy has gained control over entire Vice City and without having sent a single dime back to them. Sonny is enraged that Tommy has become independent and is hustling him, and sends collectors consisting of high-ranking Forelli members to force money out of Tommy's assets. Tommy disposes of them, but after they injure the elderly operator of his print shop of counterfeit money, he decides to cut Sonny and the Forelli family out of his business, severing his ties with the Forelli family.An angered Sonny arrives in Vice City with a small army of mafiosi, intent on taking their tribute by force. Sonny and his henchmen soon arrive at the Vercetti Estate. Just as Tommy attempts to give them their tribute in counterfeit money, Sonny reveals he is the one who set Tommy up fifteen years before, sending him to kill the eleven men who were expecting him since he was feeling that Tommy would himself take over Sonny's business. Lance then exposes himself as a traitor, revealing Tommy's attempt to fool Sonny, and also admitting to informing Sonny about Tommy's activities in Vice City. Lance explains that he did it because Tommy started to disown him and didn't treat him equally, and wanted him dead so he could rebuild the Vance Crime Family and the fortune he had with his brother. An enraged Tommy starts a gunfight.In the ensuing battle, Tommy first chases, ridicules, and finally kills Lance, then storms downstairs, where he faces off with Sonny,			"

												Tommy Vercetti, a loyal former member of the Forelli Family, has just been released in 1986, serving 15 years for killing 11 men in the Harwood District of Liberty City in early 1971, earning him the nickname The Harwood Butcher.[3] Tommy's old boss, Sonny Forelli, fears that Tommy's presence in Liberty City will heighten tensions between the other Liberty City families and bring unwanted attention to his organisation's criminal activities.[4]To prevent this from happening, Sonny ostensibly promotes Tommy to a capo and sends him to Vice City under the guardianship of a crooked lawyer and Sonny's contact Ken Rosenberg to act as their buyer for a series of cocaine deals for Sonny, whose interest is to expand his family activities down the South and to overrun the Liberty drug market with the high-end cocaine from Vice City, hoping to create a monopoly on the Liberty City drug ring to establish the Forelli Crime Family on the top.[5]Soon, Tommy and his bodyguards are awaited at the Escobar International Airport by Ken, who gives them an info about the deal and takes them to the docks, where they are awaited by the Vance Crime Family, prominent drug kingpins of Vice City led by Victor Vance, who arrive in the chopper with Diaz. As they settle the deal, they are ambushed by several armed and masked men, who kill Victor and Tommy's bodyguards. Tommy narrowly escapes with Ken from the docks, and as a result, he ultimately loses both Forelli's money and the cocaine in the process. Ken drives to his office, while Tommy returns to his hotel.[6]When Tommy informs Sonny of the ambush, Sonny loses his temper and threatens Tommy with the consequences of attempting to cheat the Mafia. Tommy promises to retrieve the money and the cocaine and kill whoever was responsible for the ambush.[7] Towards this end, Tommy meets up again with Ken at his office, who leads Tommy to retired Colonel and mid-level drug dealer named Juan Garcia Cortez, who was Victor Vance's contact and who organised the deal between the Vances and the Forellis. Cortez expresses regret about Tommy's bad deal and promises that his own lines of inquiry are being made to find out who masterminded the ambush plot. Tommy also meets Cortez's daughter Mercedes, who becomes Tommy's confidante shortly thereafter.While Tommy waits for the outcome of Cortez's investigation, he meets cocky 21-year old British record producer Kent Paul, real estate mogul Avery Carrington, and a mysterious man, who introduces himself as Lance Vance, younger brother of Victor and the underboss of the now-defunct Vance Crime Family, who wants revenge for the death of his brother and also wants the Vance Crime Family back on the map.[8]As time passes, Tommy befriends Cortez and begins to do regular work for him as an errand boy and hitman. On one such job, Tommy is called in with Lance to protect the deal of a drug baron named Ricardo Diaz during a deal with the Cubans, looking to buy some high-end cocaine. During the deal, Diaz is ambushed by a gang of Haitians, but Tommy is able to kill them and save the deal, as well as Diaz's life. Consequently, Diaz begins hiring Tommy for his own agenda. Tommy takes this work because it pays well, in spite of his distaste for Diaz. On another errand for Cortez, he plans to meet a French courier to retrieve missile chips stolen from the French government. The deal is ambushed by several French agents and Tommy later kills the courier, who fled the ambush with the chips, retrieving the items.Tommy learns from Cortez that Cortez's own lieutenant, Gonzalez, was partially responsible for the ambush on Tommy's cocaine deal since he is the only person besides Cortez to know about the deal, and Cortez asks Tommy to kill Gonzalez as a favour, since he was a man who he did distrust and was working behind his back. Afterwards, Cortez voices his suspicion that Diaz might have been behind the ambush. Tommy initially continues the status quo to prepare for his attack, but his hand is forced when Lance attempts to take revenge by himself and fails, forcing Tommy to rush across the city and rescue him from the junkyard in which he is held. With the die cast, the two move quickly to raid Diaz's mansion and execute Diaz. With Diaz dead, and Colonel Cortez fleeing the country to escape the French, the established drug empires in Vice City quickly crumble and Tommy and Lance personally take over, becoming Vice City's drug kingpins.Tommy becomes the head of his own organisation, the Vercetti Crime Family, distancing himself from the Forelli Family and Liberty City and more interested in personally controlling Vice City than being Forelli's puppet. But the more powerful and rich Tommy gets, the more Lance begins to exhibit paranoia and sociopathic behaviours, to the point that he begins to abuse his own bodyguards and constantly calls Tommy in states of hysteria, losing his mind over being just a powerless second-in-command as he was under his brother for the past 2 years. Tommy begins to suspect that Lance is up to something.Tommy makes alliance with Umberto Robina's Cubans against Auntie Poulet's Haitians, even though he is at the same time hypnotised by Poulet's voodoo into helping the Haitians as well. However, Tommy and Poulet part ways Tommy and the Cubans sneak explosives into the Haitian drug factory disguised in Haitian gang cars and blow it up, effectively ending the conflict and putting the Haitians out of business, enabling the Cubans to take over Little Havana. Umberto then becomes Tommy's partner. He also becomes friends with Big Mitch Baker, a leader of the biker gang and a Vietnam veteran, with both the bikers and the Cubans becoming protectors of Vercetti family business.As his drug business expands, Tommy buys assets in nearly bankrupt companies such as a car lot named Sunshine Autos, a cab depot Kaufmann Cabs, a popular night club called The Malibu, a local boathouse, a print shop, Print Works, an ice-cream company, and an adult film company, all of which he turns back into competitive businesses. He also becomes a personal bodyguard to glam metal band Love Fist, and pulls a major bank heist. He starts to control almost all the assets and ties of Vice City: Sunshine Autos as a chop shop, Kaufmann Cabs for money laundering, The Malibu Club for dispatching drugs, the ice-cream company for the production of drugs and the film company to control the underground movie scene.Eventually, the Forelli family discovers that Tommy has gained control over entire Vice City and without having sent a single dime back to them. Sonny is enraged that Tommy has become independent and is hustling him, and sends collectors consisting of high-ranking Forelli members to force money out of Tommy's assets. Tommy disposes of them, but after they injure the elderly operator of his print shop of counterfeit money, he decides to cut Sonny and the Forelli family out of his business, severing his ties with the Forelli family.An angered Sonny arrives in Vice City with a small army of mafiosi, intent on taking their tribute by force. Sonny and his henchmen soon arrive at the Vercetti Estate. Just as Tommy attempts to give them their tribute in counterfeit money, Sonny reveals he is the one who set Tommy up fifteen years before, sending him to kill the eleven men who were expecting him since he was feeling that Tommy would himself take over Sonny's business. Lance then exposes himself as a traitor, revealing Tommy's attempt to fool Sonny, and also admitting to informing Sonny about Tommy's activities in Vice City. Lance explains that he did it because Tommy started to disown him and didn't treat him equally, and wanted him dead so he could rebuild the Vance Crime Family and the fortune he had with his brother. An enraged Tommy starts a gunfight.In the ensuing battle, Tommy first chases, ridicules, and finally kills Lance, then storms downstairs, where he faces off with Sonny,			"

												This is a much better game than GTA 3. The design of the missions remains of the ""try again"" false-difficulty type, however. This means many missions are impossible to complete the first time around, as you have to know what to expect beforehand. This completely ruined GTA 3 for me, but this game is much more enjoyable for some reason. Perhaps it is the fat that I have found a way around the 30 fps cap, running at a smooth 60. The missions seem better thought out, the action improved, especially shooting. However, the long and unskippable cutscenes at the beginning of each mission end up grinding on my nerves after a while, given that most missions need to be undertaken a number of times before succeeding. Overall a very good game, one that I have trouble stopping playing, even today in 2015.  Proof is, I have finished all missions, but still find it fun to do things in the world of Vice City.			"

												Vice City has since I played it for the first time on Playstation 2, been my favorite Grand Theft Auto Game.Vice City takes place in the 80s, where you are playing as Tommy Vercetti. Tommy Vercetti has lost a lot of money, and needs to get them back. He is starting to work for people in Vice City, so he can pay Sonny Forelli back.One of the things I was most happy for in Vice City was the music. So if you like the 80 and 90s music, you will like most of the music in Vice City.The PC version includes a lot of new features, here are some of them: Custom Resolutions 	 (Choose your own Resolution) Better Graphics 	 (There is better Graphics and also custom Draw Distance) Custom Radio Station 	 (Upload your own mp3 and make your own Radio Station) Frame Limiter 	 (By disabling Frame Limiter, you can play Vice City in 60fps)There is of course a lot of other new features, this is just some of them.Vice City is of course recommended, and is a game you must play!

												This is one of the, if not the, best games in the series. It's my first GTA game and it's damn awesome. It sets a perfect mood of the 80's with the music, the cars, and other things. The map is decent in size and I still seem to find something fun to do everytime I put the game on. The story is OK, but most people only play this game to mess around in the sandbox (like me). You can buy properties after you finish the career, and some of them can generate money. There's a pretty good variety of vehicles, and the taxis, firetrucks, ambulances, and police cars all have their own missions, as well as a few of the other properties you buy (like the Ice Cream shop). There are also cool minigames scattered around the map, like racing an R/C car in  the sand. I wish that there would be more planes for you to use, since the only one you get is at the top of the endgame mansion. Overall, it's a real fun game, and I give it a 9.7/10.			"

												I had this game when I was 15 on PS2, almost completed it but due to my file on the memory card being corrupted. I couldn't complete it.So I found GTA VC on GMG for £1.20 and the 15 yo self demanded it to be played and completed. It was hard to not look at it from a 2014 perspective, because I was playing sleeping dogs at the same which is far superior in every way.First of all, use cheats, otherwise you will run out of money buying armour and weapons all the time. Also, as it is an old game, there is no load option in the pause menu. You have to drive to your home to save or load a game, which can get frustrating every time you die or get arrested and want to save money by not spending it again on weapons and armour. The graphics are average, it is an old game so we will let that pass. The physics, however, are absolutely horrible, you fall immediately off a motorcycle from the slightest of touches; using planes and helicopters are a drag, and some cars are just impossible to drive with.OK, the game. Tommy Vercetti is your lead character, and he's come to Vice City to take it over. You do missions for various gangs, businesses, and mafia type bosses. One tip, after a while you'll notice you don't have any missions to do, even though the story is clearly not finish. You have to buy the printworks, and 5 other businesses (Not Homes!) and complete the missions for all of them. To know if you completed the missions, the businesses will generate money for you which you can collect often. DO NOT BUY THE PORN STUDIOS! The missions for that one are absolutely dire and no fun at all. Best ones are the Kauffman cab, and I heard the Malibu club is pretty good too.After a while you're old mafia boss comes after you and you have to kill. It's pretty basic mafia story that is clearly inspired by scarface. It's a good story and you do enjoy watching the cut scenes due to the array characters involved.GTA VC is still for me the best GTA game. The size of the  map was perfect and the story was pretty decent1The radio shows are also perfect, playing the best music that represents the 80s feel of the game.  Small things like physics of vehicals and graphics are a negative, but they won't be too much of a hassle. I recommend playing with a mouse just so you can shoot better. If you want to use a controller, I suggest you look online to find forums that help you with that as this GTA VC doesn't support controllers very well.Overall, I'll give this a 7/10			"

												Today's games may be better at graphics, gameplay, shooting & driving mechanics, scenario etc... But, Vice City is a very good game for nostalgia-lovers. It has kinda basic mechanics, bad graphics, old-tech-gameplay, but, I couldn't find any better atmosphere in any other Grand Theft Auto games. Florida theme, colorful world and enjoying gameplay makes this game beautiful. Everybody will enjoy from taking a sports car, switching to Flash FM, driving around city when listening Billie Jeans from Michael Jackson or spawning a tank and being a destroyer or buying M-60 with lots of ammo and being a badass etc... There are too many options to enjoying this game. Anyways, I think everybody had better buy this game.			"

												This game is amazing. Ive already beat it once and it was an amazing experience. If you like Saints Row, GTA or any other game revolving being a gangster who goes around murdering people and blowing stuff up then this game is for you :)			"

												GTA: VC runs and plays just fine on my pc. Other than that, you know what you're getting with this one. It is a bit older, but still enjoyable and plays well. Story and atmosphere are superb. Highly recommended, expecially if you can catch it on sale.			"

												A classic game.Genre defining (or creating?) open world action.For me, it was one of the most important games when i startet playing on the PC.I came from consolegaming and was owerwhelmed by the possibilities this game offers.Up till today it has a pretty unic story and it is still worth playing the game, even the visuals are cool again in our ""retro""-times!would recommend this game to everyone with a decent sense for humour.

												The story didn't have enough explanation at times, and there are definitely other GTAs with more things to do, but GTA Vice City is a great, solid section of the GTA franchise.It's the 80s, the time of colorful pastel suits and track outfits that just never seemed to go out of style. The music industry was entering a new age with all of the technology, and the development of the metropolis became official. But what do I know. GTA VC had a lot of content, but compared to the other GTAs didn't have too much innovation compared to previous titles (and future GTAs for sure) but it was a solid, fun, enjoyable game. The story was gritty and solid, not the best by far but it is still great and important to the GTA universe as it's contribution in the Miami Vice department.In terms of personalization, there isn't much, but you get to be a crime lord, spending money on property and what not. While I think the future GTAs were better, as expected, this is still a classic you will have a hard time putting down.I played the crap out of this for years and have nothing but respect for the game, but if you aren't buying it to grow your GTA collection and be a completionist for the series, there are probably other GTAs you should be prioritizing first to maximize your experience.+Good weapon variety+Great soundtrack and radio stations, not that the new generation of Ipad kids will appreciate it though :(-AI made you want to throw up sometimes+Map was very beautiful...-... but the actual structure of the city was a mess-no swimming			"

												Vice City is, perhaps, not the most notable game in the GTA franchise. It could've been a DLC for GTA 3, but content-wise it's a full game of its own. It puts you in a world oozing of 80s pop culture, and you would have to be crazy not to love that. The game has some small improvements over GTA 3, and features some new stuff that vary from good to less good. It's easy to see that things started leaning toward a less arcade-like experience than GTA 3, which continued later in the series. For instance, the protagonist now has a voice and personality. The series gains some new grounds with Vice City, but it's pretty much on-par with GTA 3. It's not as revolutionary as GTA 3, but it's definitely a good game, and shows the direction the franchise later took. A positive recommendation from me.			"

												The middle child of the GTA PS2 trilogy, and a solid entry in its own right, but for some reason this one just feels a bit more of an afterthought compared to the other two. Objectively, it's better than GTA3 in most ways, but it's not the original, nor does it reach the heights of the third game - this is likely amplified because I came to this game after having played the other two. That being said, this game is an absolute joy to play, and anyone who has nostalgia for the 80s will LOVE the music.So, just like the other two, a must-have for any person looking to build the collection. If you're only picking up one GTA from this era, I would suggest getting San Andreas, but really, everyone should pick up all three.			"

												Nostalgia aside, this game succedes in everything it does. It captures the 80's atmosfere surprisingly well, the soundtrack is amazing, the voice acting still manages to immerse you into the game and it's a noticeable improvement compared to Grand Theft Auto III (which I didn't enjoy very much, don't hurt me).It may feel aged, specially after coming back from playing V (like me), but it's still as fun as the first time I played it all those years ago.

												Of all the GTA games, this one provides the extra jolt of 80s fun. An enjoyably saturation of Miami Vice and every action flick of the decade, this game is an experience more than a sweat-pouring mission run.Sure, you could vent about some of the harder missions and dismiss its achievement in gaming history by quickly comparing it with the later run of the series.But before you do, steal a fast car, turn on the radio, and speed past the slowpokes as you take in that sunset.Then, play a little GTA Vice City. It's a lotta fun. "

Short version: 92%GTA: Vice City is probably the goofiest, yet most timeless entry in the GTA series. Bright colours, fast cars, nonsensical missions, funny characters, and great controls made sure that this game is still regarded by many as their favourite in the franchise.Long version:Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is a strange one, even for GTA. The whole game is more or less an 18-hour parody of Miami Vice– a half-forgotten, enjoyably dumb action show of the 80s. Everything is colourful and neon bright, and practically every story mission, every character, every random dialogue is a parody of something (just listen to the two talk show radios; they are full of the weirdest things).What makes it a masterpiece is that none of these are over the top. The storyline may be silly at some points, but the core of it is deadly serious: you play as a gangster who was sent to Vice City (Miami) to create a foothold for the Mafia drug business. The deal goes belly-up, but by the end of the game you somehow become the de facto crime lord of the city, either by buying or killing any opposition.The missions that lead to this goal have great variety and design; almost none feel the same and everyone can find their favourites among them. To complete them, you have access to a wider variety of weapons and vehicles, which now include aircraft and motorcycles. Travelling around is quite easy and fun now.Many old-school game elements like bomb shops and the top-down camera were removed, but they are rarely missed with such improvements as purchasable assets, which all can be turned into a money-making machine after you complete their associated tasks. Although you still cannot spend that money on anything but more assets and weapons.These smaller and larger touches not only made Vice City a great game, but also probably the most characteristic and memorable one in the GTA franchise, earning it a permanent spot in many of the players’ hearts.

												%100'ed this game in approx. 60 hours. So I know a lot of things about this game.First of all pros:+ Characters were... ummm, good.+ Music was awesome.+ Realistic driving handling.+ Nice atmosphere for its time.+ Acceptable graphics for its time.+ Good side-missions.Cons:- Missions were so unbalanced. Some of them were extremely easy, some of them were so difficult.- The game itself is unbalanced! You can die in 2 or 3 seconds if you are under enemy attack.- You'll come to a point where you'll need a lot of money. Yes, you'll stuck for having small amount of money...And also, %100 of this game is hard. Yep, this is really hard. This was harder than San Andreas for me.But overall this was a nice and fun experience for me eventhough I rage quit and screamed a lot. I can't believe myself how I missed this masterpiece.			"

The story is one of the best ever, it keeps you interested till the very end making you play mission after mission as hours fly by.

												A true classic. While I would not consider this the best in the series, it is definitely a fun game. GTA Vice City capitalizes on GTA III's mechanics, but adds a whole new story and setting with interesting characters and a fun plot. The game is buggy and annoying at times, and trying to beat the game without using any cheats to earn money is almost impossible, but if you do, it is completely satisfying. In my honest opinion, I recommend completing GTA III first just to make the whole game's experience a bit more familiar and easy. GTA Vice City is a classic and is always fun to revisit every now and then.			"

The only thing that isn't fantastic is the 30 fps cap but that can be fixed with some tinkering. Just buy it. It's great.			"

												Brilliant game, personally my favourite GTA as a kid and still is, characters are funny and interesting, graphics for the time it was released are pretty good, the music amazing, in my opinion one of the best stories in a GTA game and the game just makes you feel engaged, there is the odd bug but its an old game so you cant really fault it for that.All in all well worth the money to buy and still one of the best GTA games in my opinion			"

												GTA Vice City is a great game and maybe you've played it before on the PS2 or Xbox. This is less of a review and more of a, ""here's what you need to get it running perfectly on PC."" Because, by default, it doesn't support widescreen resolutions, you need to force v-sync, it has a number of bugs that can be fixed using a patch,Let's start with the controller. This modder, Silent, is a diety. They've done so much for the classic GTA games. They modded the GInput inputs for 360 controllers so that the 360 controller button will actually appear on screen, not to mention function since Rockstar really didn't bother with controller support for the PC versions. Also, the controllers can be set to the style of GTA IV gameplay. This mod has full support of other controllers as well, such as the Dualshock and most certainly Logitech controllers. I haven't tried the Steam controller on it though. Download it here: http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=24272, you'll be able to pick out Vice City from the options given. Once download, just unzip and follow the instructions.To get GTA Vice City working in widescreen, you will need to download a fix from ThirteenAG. It's extremely simple. Just download, unzip, and read the instructions. https://thirteenag.github.io/wfp#gtavc You'll also see widescreen fixes for GTA III and San Andreas if you haven't gotten to those.To force v-sync, it's going to depend on whether or not you're using an AMD or Nvidia card. I have an AMD R9 280, so if you have an AMD card, you're going to want to access the Radeon settings, go to the gaming tab, find Vice City, click it, find a tab that says ""Wait for Vertical Refresh"", hit the drop down arrow, you want it set to always on. On an Nvidia card, you want to open the Nvidia control panel, go to 3D settings, find Vice City from the drop down bar, select it, scroll down til you find v-sync, and same thing, set it to always on.The SilentPatch is necessary if you want good lighting and shadowing. http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=25368, you have your options to choose from the classic GTA games, but be sure to also download the DDraw patch from the same set of downloads. It improves the draw distance. Download both files, extract, and read the instructions.That should be about it. I hope you enjoy the game as it is quite a lot of fun. Brilliant soundtrack. Good story. Fun side missions (asset missions). Doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a solid 9.0/10			"

												GTA 3 is great, but GTA Vice City is greater. Vice City takes what GTA 3 established, preserved it, improved it and added to it. Taking place in 1986 Vice City, you play as Italian American mobster Tommy Vercetti. Immediately upon arriving in Vice City, a deal that was supposed to establish him in the city is attacked, forcing him to leave the goods at the site. The rest of the game involves rising up, killing the man responsible for the attack, obtaining a mansion, killing your former boss and ally, and ruling Vice City. Perhaps the best part of Vice City for me is the soundtrack. Containing many songs from artists like Toto, Hall and Oates, Michael Jackson, Laura Branigan and Foreigner, along with two complete talk show stations, Vice City will keep you busy in the audio department. Unlike the soundtrack of GTA 3 which mostly consisted of stereotypical late 90s pop music and typically left me only tuning to Flashback FM with its Scarface soundtrack, Vice City sometimes left me driving around just to listen to the great music or VCPR, its guests and its bitter Hispanic host, Maurice Chavez. If none of that fascinates you, the PC version supports a custom radio station. Just drag your .mp3 files into its folder, and you can drive to your own music. Sadly, due to the vast amount of copyrighted music, rights expire, and songs are lost. This song being Lionel Richie's ""Running With the Night"", which was present on the PS2 version but absent from the PC version. Compared to GTA 3, there is alot more things to have and to do. Motorcycles, helicopters and alot more boats are the firsts in the vehicle department. Many more weapons, like revolvers, chainsaws, hammers, combat shotguns, submachine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles and even screwdrivers are some of the new additions. A lot more is also added mechanic wise, like the ability to dive out of cars, crouch and aim properly are some new additions. Vice City itself is quite beautiful, with many neon, art deco buildings and skyscrapers can be found in the city. Most buildings in the game are just low res textures, but the interiors you could enter are beautiful, like the mansion, the hotel room, the dance club and the strip club. Perhaps the biggest change between GTA 3 and Vice City is the addition of a speaking protagonist. Not only does Tommy Vercetti have a lot more personality and charm, he is more likeable. Another addition is the ability to buy safehouses and businesses. In GTA 3, you are given a safehouse on each island but that is about it. In addition to being more convenient, the latter is also fun and necessary. After killing the man who set you up, you can buy up various businesses around Vice City, like a Car Dealership, a Boatyard, a Strip Club, a Pornography movie studio and a dance club. All of these businesses set up fun missions with them. For example, the dance club opens up a series of bank heist missions, the boatyard opens up a long stunt course, and the car dealership opens up a mission to retrieve certain cars on a list, which will get you both a monetary reward and a bunch of fast cars, like a DeLorean or a race car. There is alot more in Vice City that just have to be seen to be believed. Some features of the PC version include the ability to aim with any weapon, the ability to change the player's skin and, as I mentioned, the ability to make a custom radio station. For the money, Vice City is definitely worth it. Buy it.			"

												This is one of my favourite games of all time. I have played many of 100s of hours since it's launch on PS2 back in 2002, I own it on pretty much all platforms now.The cheesy 80s, Scarface setting is what most attracts me about this game, I love the era even if I myself was not born in it. It's vivid colours and bright neon lights makes it very colourful, especially if you start painting you car with the blood of an unsuspecting pedestrian. This is a gory game, but it is comical. The story is great and the gameplay is a hell of a lot of fun. Graphics are top of the range but why does it have to be? The many collectables and side missions just keep you playing. Even when you've completed everything you still find yourself running around cauing chaos wherever you can. This is addictive.If you don't already own this game, WHY THE HELL NOT, TOMMY?			"

However, the map isn't particularly dense in detail and/or diversity (is almost devoid of any exploration other than the city), as it does not include terrain/landscapes, just city. Which is a huge let down for me, as I enjoy open-world games primarily for the exploration aspect. If you want exploration, go get GTA SA or GTA V when it comes out.			"

Now it's up to you, how you will regain money and drugs that you lost. And most of all - do you have enough guts to become crime boss of Vice City? You can wander around in streets of the city, cause mayhem, steal cars, kill everybody you like with nice bunch of different weapons (including chainsaws and katanas), drive taxi or fire truck or deliver pizzas and meet new and mostly corrupt people. Atmosphere is cool as it was in ""Miami Vice"" and soundtrack is absolutely best in whole game series. More 1980's than decade was itself. Definitely a game you must have.			"

												Well i got my reasons why i think this is the best GTA ever and that's because it's tropical and color full. got a weakness for that in games. But beware that if you buy this and wants to play it on windows 8 and 8.1 you will get all bugs this game ever had and even more. let me tell you some of them they are pretty funny and still destroys the orginal feeling. the game is wonderful below windows 8 since the game is not optimized for windows 8 and 8.1 but here is the bugs i got:1. Animations plays really fast (smoke really much and the weather) the speed is like 100%2. many functions like look around the car seems to not be working either 3. and oh yeah saving, loading and complete a mission takes forever it load really slow takes 5min (not joking)4. and it render everything in one and begins lags at certain points.below windows 8 and 8.1 this is a really great game that doesn't have those bugs. but it's cheap at sales so if you don't trust me buy it yourself at a sale and test it for paying fullprice for see if i'm right is just stupid.

												Its got an amazing soundtrack. Great game mechanics, etc...Its a GTA game, get it an dtry it out, I love listening to some Love Fist and driving a comet whilst being chased by the police and shooting them.Yes the game has some bugs that are almost game breaking and there are also levels that are so tedious that it is like trying to ask out a lesbian friend of yours to prom, but nothing is impossible and she says yes! ( Referencing to the helicopter mission in which you must move dynamite from one place to another for like 4 minutes, whilst you drive an Toy Helicopter that is beaten by angry construction workers and security guards but otherwise I can look over that.4/5 the level took me months to pass.

The humor is great, it's not as feature filled as the other, newer, gtas, but the nostalgia is enough for this game. And it's much better on pc then ps2, so if you have a copy on xbox, mobile, or ps2, still purchase a copy for your pc.			"

												[9/10] - I closely relate this game to Mafia II, only because of its ability to really make you feel like your in the times, in this case the 80's. For me, no other two games do it better. This was actually the first GTA title I ever played back in the day, and to this day is still my favorite. No description needs to be made about gameplay, it's fantastic and entertaining just like every other GTA on the market. But for those who have good taste in music, and want to take a ride in the classics, and really just want to feel like you're in one of the best decades ever, then this is where it's at. Not much else can be said except it's great fun, has a good story, and is completely addictive. PS2 is better in my opinion just for the controls, however the PC version looks much better.			"

												The game that introduced me to 80’s music. Hands down the best radio stations in any open world game ever. Anything that I disliked about this game when I was younger I grew to love as I got older. It’s a perfect game to me I love everything about it. I love the cheesy story, the ridiculous characters, and all the crazy missions. Vice city is so fun to drive around it’s so memorable. Sure there is the annoying mission here or there and it can be very frustrating to new players but because I played through this game so much I grew to like them and accept them as part of the game and the overall package.   10/10 (Masterpiece)			"

Its story line is interesting and always seems to keep you entertained and immersed in action, as the Grand Theft Auto series is renowned for, the Miami feel to the game, in where it is situated, gives it that beech going immersed experience.

												While it may be a far cry from San Andreas or Modern GTA games in terms of content, I'd say this one is my personal favorite for its atmosphere, characters, setting, soundtrack, easter eggs, and nostalgic value. With 1980's charm pouring out of its♥♥♥♥♥ it makes of a unique entry in the series, being riddled with several nods and references to events, and Movies/TV shows (notably Miami Vice and Scarface). The gameplay is your run-in-the-mill post-GTA III formula a.k.a a free-roam sandbox. You go on missions to kill people while protecting and optionally developing your own dirty business that will eventually pay for itself to eventually achieve vengeance. While the story is linear, being a sandbox game, you have plenty of freedom. In addition, you have several sidequests, such as Vigilante and Ambulance mission, or item collecting, with worthwhile rewards, like increased Max Health or Missile-Firing Choppers. The game supports both Keyboard+Mouse and Gamepad modes, which puts this game ahead of its time in this particular aspect.The cons are fairly simple fixes. Being a pre-HD era game, the game isn't optimized for Widescreen monitors, and while there is an in-game option for Widescreen, it steches the HUD and just crops the top and bottom. This can be fixed either by playing it in 4:3, or via simple mods for true, uncropped/unstretched Widescreen. Another issue that may affect most modern rigs is that you may have trouble getting the game to run. This again can be fixed through simple tweaks.If you're gonna get into the GTA games and don't mind playing something that's only a decade old, this entry is definitely one that shouldn't be overlooked.

												GTA Vice City - A true, timeless masterpiece, that has endured the test of time and is still one of the best games in the series.Just like all older games, this one does not strike you with stunning visuals, like the newer additions in the series like GTA IV and V. But graphics is not all about a game. GTA Vice City offers a great story, characters and the feeling of freedom in its beautiful open-world city, that only few other games manage to capture. The refferences to the pop culture of the 80s are to be found literaly everywhere in Vice City, which accomplishes the atmosphere of the 80s' Miami, which the game aims to recreate in its own unique style.  The style of the people that you see in the streets, the cars, the buildings' architecture and the scenery all help you immerse with the game and makes you feel as if you are watching a movie, rather than playing a game.The soundtrack that Rockstar have compiled is divine, topping even those from the newer entries in the GTA series. All the radio stations in the game are absolutely fantastic with songs from the titans of the 80s' musical scene like Michael Jackson, Ozzy Osbourne, Mr. Mister, Toto, INXS, Laura Brannigan and many others. Even if you don't like this kind of music, the game will make you fall in love with it. But there's more - the radio stations' DJs will make you laugh all the time with their comments on topics that satirize different aspects of the life in the 80s. And the commercials too!The story of the game is also brilliant. As if it is directly taken from a classical gangster movie. Filled with action, twists and many great characters you will be thrilled from the start and until the very end. But even after the completion of all the story missions you will have to spend many more hours if you want to unlock 100% of the game. The game will offer you more than at least 20 hours of sheer fun, but no doubt you will want to come back again and play it over and over again. But if you don't like playing by the rules, you will still be able to find lots of fun things to do. Steal a car, go on a rampage, attain a six-star wamted level and have some fun blowing up police and military vehicles and shooting SWAT teams with tons of great weapons, as they try to stop you.More than 10 years after its initial release GTA Vice City is still the excellent game it used to be. If you have not had the chance to play the game until now, do not hesitate and get it right away.10/10 points for an amazing game!			"

												GTA Vice City - A true, timeless masterpiece, that has endured the test of time and is still one of the best games in the series.Just like all older games, this one does not strike you with stunning visuals, like the newer additions in the series like GTA IV and V. But graphics is not all about a game. GTA Vice City offers a great story, characters and the feeling of freedom in its beautiful open-world city, that only few other games manage to capture. The refferences to the pop culture of the 80s are to be found literaly everywhere in Vice City, which accomplishes the atmosphere of the 80s' Miami, which the game aims to recreate in its own unique style.  The style of the people that you see in the streets, the cars, the buildings' architecture and the scenery all help you immerse with the game and makes you feel as if you are watching a movie, rather than playing a game.The soundtrack that Rockstar have compiled is divine, topping even those from the newer entries in the GTA series. All the radio stations in the game are absolutely fantastic with songs from the titans of the 80s' musical scene like Michael Jackson, Ozzy Osbourne, Mr. Mister, Toto, INXS, Laura Brannigan and many others. Even if you don't like this kind of music, the game will make you fall in love with it. But there's more - the radio stations' DJs will make you laugh all the time with their comments on topics that satirize different aspects of the life in the 80s. And the commercials too!The story of the game is also brilliant. As if it is directly taken from a classical gangster movie. Filled with action, twists and many great characters you will be thrilled from the start and until the very end. But even after the completion of all the story missions you will have to spend many more hours if you want to unlock 100% of the game. The game will offer you more than at least 20 hours of sheer fun, but no doubt you will want to come back again and play it over and over again. But if you don't like playing by the rules, you will still be able to find lots of fun things to do. Steal a car, go on a rampage, attain a six-star wamted level and have some fun blowing up police and military vehicles and shooting SWAT teams with tons of great weapons, as they try to stop you.More than 10 years after its initial release GTA Vice City is still the excellent game it used to be. If you have not had the chance to play the game until now, do not hesitate and get it right away.10/10 points for an amazing game!			"

- Vice City is amazing- The story scenes were great for 2002 standards.- Lance VanceCons:- Nowadays, we would love to see a remake!- A few issues with W8.1 and 10 with the ""SilentPatch"".- If you want light trails mod it until it crashes xD http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=22416I highly recommend to have this version on your Steam library but...if you have a PS2. Play the game there. That was the real experience. Period!

												What can I say? Vice City is a classic. Great soundtrack, characters, graphics, voice acting, gameplay, missions, storyline. Almost as good as San Andreas, but the downside to Vice City to me is that there is less interaction with the world such as restaurants, casinos, bars, etc. Thankfully though, this was all done in it's successor San Andreas two years later.

												What I like about this game is the shiny water and the glow of the roads when it's raining, and I think the feeling of this game is what makes it so special !The storyline is great and the setting in 1986 was the proper date based on the events of the game !One of the things you can't hate about this game is the soundtrack ! And that's because it features a variety of music between Pop and 80's Rock !I'd also like to talk about the graphics of the game wich were pretty advanced compared to the release date in 2002 and the game released before it wich was GTA III.This game was the first in the GTA series to feature the following:-Motorcycles.-Helicopters.-And the ability to enter safehouses, and some of the shops and buildings.ProsAwesome lighting effectsNew Cars- helisOwn BusinessesHidden packages hidden all round the cityFunny scenesgreat story/diologueset in 80s in miamigood driving mechanicsSafe houses and buildings able to enterConsCant swim			"

												It's the eighties, do a lot of coke and vote for Ronald Reagan.Almost everything about this game is perfect, even on PC. Despite being one of the earlier PC ports of the 3D GTA titles it's relatively easy to control. There's a surprisingly large amount of graphics options for such an old game and especially one to come out in this time period when consoles were king in developers' eyes, so kudos to Rockstar for actually thinking this out.I really think that the 80's are the perfect decade for GTA. The decade of decadence. Crime was getting more common, drugs were getting harder and easier to get, and the media was getting more violent. It was a time of total unhindered immoral activity. It basically screams Grand Theft Auto.The soundtrack is amazing. I'm really into heavy metal and new wave, so I'm very biased when it comes to this kind of thing, but trust me, there's nothing like running over pedestrians in a muscle car while listening to Iron Maiden's ""Two Minutes to Midnight"" or fleeing from the police in a taco truck while blasting ""Video Killed The Radio Star"" by The Buggies.There's a wide variety of melee weapons, and while the guns are nice I think the wide variety of weapons such as the chainsaw (straight out of Scarface) and a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥really set the tone for the game.Tommy Vercetti is also a great character. He's beautifully two dimensional and the writers didn't try to ♥♥♥♥♥foot around that. He's a cold blooded Mafia hit man who's been released from prison after killing 11 guys and he's still♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. He's not an Anti Hero like Niko Bellic who's just trying to get the American Dream, nor is he an Anti Hero like CJ who's trying to protect his neighborhood from drugs and rival gangs. He's just a really bad guy. If you cross him, he will kill you. If you mess up a job he's on, he will kill you. If you don't pay him, you guessed it, he will kill you. It's that simple. His American Dream is making others' lives a nightmare.However, there are two things I don't like about this game though. One is the graphics. The models, especially the character models, are terrible. They haven't aged well, and the game was obviously made in 2002. This is especially noticeble when the various ""sexy"" female characters are onscreen, because while they are obviously human, they basically look like they had their breasts and hips glued on. The wacky 80's hairstyles have a simaler problem, as do the brightly colorerd clothes that the majority of the main characters (and Tommy himself) wear. They look as if they've been painted or nailed on to some kind of puppet or mannequin. I honestly think that the models in System Shock 2 looked better than this.The second thing is the lack of multiplayer. Add the fact that MultiTheftAuto is terrible and you have a huge problem. I understand that when Vice City came out, the main focus was on the PS2, which at that time still didn't have online multiplayer capabilites, so it is forgivable, but still, it's disappointing.Overall, I think this is the greatest Grand Theft Auto game out there. Yes, even better than San Andreas. It's just totally tubular.			"

												This game is like Grand Theft Auto except it's in the 80s. Theres a lot of music on the radio and people have hair. Some people have glasses and pink suits but it was normal back then. The graphics are really ahead of it's time (this game was made in 1988). Tommy Vercetti has a really cool shirt and you can actually make him steal cars which is pretty cool cause you can't do that in real life.10/10 probably the best game I've played this week.			"

												Grand Theft Auto: Vice CityPositives:+ Perfect storyline, well made. + Amazing reconstruction of the 1980's with authentic music on radio stations, similar cars and clothing to the time period.+ Characters, especially the central one (Tommy Vercetii) are interesting.+ Large array of weapons to choose from, military grade assault rifles, pistols, a plethora of melee weapons, rocket launchers, sniper rifles, the list goes on.+ Open-world game where the only limit is your imagination. Mixed:~ Graphics are OK, the game is over a decade old now but still entirely 3D. Negatives:- Game can be viewed as short, takes around 20 hours to finish.Overall Score: 8.5/10Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is a fantastic tale of the criminal underworld in the 1980's. Hugely entertaining game and well worth the price considering it's quite cheap nowadays.			"

												My favourite GTA game by far. The combination of an 80s setting,great story(plus the amazing soundtrack)gives this game a never-ending charm. This is the only GTA game where I have just sat in my car and left a song playing. The soundtrack of this game is basically a ""greatest hits of the 80s"", so you could buy this game just for the soundtrack. Now, lets talk about the gameplay. While the game isn't too different from GTA 3, it has some notable improvements. Helicopters are now available to fly and the dodo from GTA 3 is now a proper plane. Motorcycles are also available. Aside from some new weapons, the gameplay hasn't changed much from GTA 3. The story takes elements from Scarface and Miami Vice to create a solid plot. The story has all the usual stuff you expect from a GTA game like betrayal and the rest.Overall, if you are a fan of the 80s or miami, or just GTA in general, then this game is well worth playing.

												Personally, this is my least favourite GTA game. That doesn't mean the game shouldn't be played, though. There are many improvements over the first GTA in 3D (GTA III), but I didn't enjoy this one as much.  If you decide to install the texture mod ""Vice Cry"" (which, by the way, it's pretty good) beware because it might randomly break your save files. After starting a new playthrough with the mod and playing for a week or so, I couldn't load my save file any more and I gave up trying to fix it. Just save in different slots so you don't lose everything, but otherwise I recommend installing that mod and playing this game. And, as always, the music in this GTA is outstanding (specially FLASH FM!). In fact, the music is so good that you'll reach your destination and won't get outta the car until the song finishes... and if you are not quick enough, you'll be stuck in the car listening to the next song too. Worth playing, even if it's just to see the evolution of the GTA franchise and experience the 80's through its soundtrack.			"

												If you haven't already played this game, where have you been for the past 15 odd years?! This is probably the GTA most people started off playing. The Miami elements of Vice City make this a particular favourite of the franchise. Again, it is your typical GTA game, going around  doing missions for people with shady characters, buying properties and shooting cops and gangs. Even today you can enjoy Vice City as much as any other AAA game. This game is proof that graphics are not everything. If you haven't already played this game or simply want to have a trip down nostalgia lane, then I would highly recommend this game! 9/10			"

												I remember playing this game before I was a teenager on a borrowed PS2 were the disc was accidentally left in the console, whoops! Well im still sane and normal, mostly....To this day Grand Theft Auto: Vice City remains one of my favourite games in the GTA series and still doesn't feel that old. It tells a great story inspired by the 80's Scarface film, only replacing the much loved Colombian-hating Cuban, Tony Montana with a really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off, former mafioso from Liberty City, Tommy Vercetti.12/13 years later, Vice City continues to deliver an entertaining experience that many of the GTA games both old and new do. It puts you in an 80's world where abnormal hair styles were trendy and where great music was played left right and centre. It offers a fantastic set of characters ranging from cool, witless gangsters to psychotic, drug lords who prefer to shoot their VCRs instead of actually plugging them in. It offers a simple but, fun way to run your own little empire of various buisnesses (later on) and never fails to capture that 80's image. Like it's predecessor this game made history, an I am not talking about the number of copies it sold. For many like myself  vice city was dare I say a childhood memory that I will not forgot for as long as I can still play this game. For me this was my introduction to the GTA series and wow was it a good one. If you are a fan of Grand Theft Auto, but have never played this then I can tell you despite it's age, I don't think you will be dissapointed, unless you are a modern graphics/mechanics fanatic, which in that case then you need to broaden your horizans.Do I recommend this game? Absolutely!			"

												If you got neves to get over tons of bugs this game contains,then you shoul play it. I mean its not that bad,except Lance dying in couple cutscenes and you fail mission,that bug when you are shooting someone from short distance and bullets pass right through him/her,and driving is not that well (car get rolled over very easy and s**t like that)...On the good side,I like the city it self,graphics are ok (considering time game is made),also a lot of cool characters and places (especially if you seen few theme based movies,you can recognize few of them),Tommy him self is cool guy to play as. Story is ok,you go through it easily,no mission is too hard except that one where you have to race that nerd guy in front of the club,where I recommend using slow motion cheat.So game is ok,I had lot of fun and lost nerves playing it,I have spent over 15 hours playing it,so yea,I recommend this game.

												My favourite GTA game by far. The combination of an 80s setting,great story(plus the amazing soundtrack)gives this game a never-ending charm. This is the only GTA game where I have just sat in my car and left a song playing. The soundtrack of this game is basically a ""greatest hits of the 80s"", so you could buy this game just for the soundtrack. Now, lets talk about the gameplay. While the game isn't too different from GTA 3, it has some notable improvements. Helicopters are now available to fly and the dodo from GTA 3 is now a proper plane. Motorcycles are also available. Aside from some new weapons, the gameplay hasn't changed much from GTA 3. The story takes elements from Scarface and Miami Vice to create a solid plot. The story has all the usual stuff you expect from a GTA game like betrayal and the rest.Overall, if you are a fan of the 80s or miami, or just GTA in general, then this game is well worth playing.

												Flash FM is da best radio station in Vice City!Anyway i grow up side by side this game so it's little subjective opinion on.I like Sunshine Autosalon, and others asset missios. Great idea with gang war between Haitians and Cubans. It's make me laugh manytimes. =) Simple another awesome GTA game. Lot of car types, guns, property to buy a lot of fun and free world to enjoy all Vice City and game.Cons - again not able to swim = death, cannot carry more kinds of one type of guns, not possible to wiev around by mouse in car or backwards by walk.I recommend whis game for all. Once you try, never want to stop play over and over again. =)			"

												Simply the best GTA ever made! There will be no other like this. Players who value an immersive theme and storyline will overlook the now obsolete graphics of this masterpiece, which at the time were almost twice as good as it's predecessor (GTA III). This is one of my favourite games of all time and I'm not saying this just because the 80's are one of my favourite eras in history. Although I only have ~10h on record as I am writing this review, I have played this game for hundreds of hours long before I purchased it on Steam. Game works perfectly on Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit. All those who have problems should look into the compatibility settings.Highly reccomended classic.9/10 - Cuz you die in water, can you blame me?			"

												An absolute classic and one of my favourite games of all time. Back when this was released it was the pinnacle of gaming with a vast open world and so much stuff to do and see. I still love to go back to this and play a little from time to time, listening to the amazing soundtrack of 80's power ballads whilst cruising through the neon streets of miami. Tommy Vercetti is a great and legendary character with lots of funny humor and quotes which stick in the memory. Still defenitely worth a play although it is kinda old and dated, even for nostalgia sake :P			"

												Memorable. This GTA had some of the coolest 80's themed radio stations, and allowed you to buy all kinds of businesses and houses as part of the game, each providing unique perks. Probably more higher-tier weapon variety than the newer GTAs as well.Unfortunately, at this point, the graphics are seriously dated, and the game doesn't offer much if any controller-support for 360 controllers like newer GTAs provide. If that doesn't bother you though, this might be worth checking out.			"

												A Classic the only downfall is the end game which forces you to do alot of side content in order to progress. The only GTA in the trilogy where money matters and there is no money code. So spend wisely as locations will be expensive and you will need the money. Runs flawless and has good controls my only gripe is trying to use a save from the internet seems to not work like GTA II or SA.			"

												Another great GTA classic. Since it is over 10 years old, still a very fun game. Spent lots of hours on the ps2. Still has those moments when you don't want to leave the car because of the good music. This game is what got me into and love 80's music			"

												If you can not play this game even you try compatibility setting and DEP list, try to delete gta-vc.exe than change the testapp.exe name to gta-vc.exe. It works!The best game ever.Translating in Turkish:Eğer uyumluluk modu ve DEP listesine eklemeyi denediğiniz halde açılmıyorsa, oyunun bulunduğu klasörden gta-vc.exe yi silin orada bulunan testapp.exe nin ismini gta-vc.exe diye değiştirin ve çözüldü!Tüm zamanın en iyi oyunu.

												This game is by far the best in the GTA franchise and one of my favourite games of all time. I played it way too much back in the days (over 12 years ago as of this review) and since I now upgraded my computer I thought ""why the heck not?"" and even today this game still delivers! The soundtrack, ""Miami"", ""Scarface"", humour, memorable characters and so on. There is simply an endless amount of things to do in this game. I loved taking over the city and owning businesses, collecting money as well as messing around with all the side missions/collectables that actually gave me some useful bonuses.I played through this game in about 16 hours and loved every second of it. This is a standard that games of today never will reach again. I got the complete experience for less than ten euros while other games offer less than half the entertainment for 50-70€ (let's not forget DLC and season passes). Since the game is on sale at the moment I can warmly recommend it to anyone who is even the tiniest bit interested.Buy this game! You will not regret it! 10/10.Note! If you are playing this game on a high end PC you may encounter various bugs and glitches. 90% of them are hilarious but the annoying ones you can easily fix using google.			"

												This is the first GTA game I actually ever played, though it's my second favorite in the series. Second only from the length of gameplay though does it fall behind San Andreas, excluding that it has the best campaign of any GTA I've ever played. I remember when it came out that my desktop could barely run it maxed and now my laptop maxes it out with an Intel HD 3000. I decided to mod it up to modern expectations and after many google searches and overhauls I settled on Vice Cry as a base for expansion. Vice Cry tripled the view distance, replaced the meshes for the cars with the xbox versions (higher detail), applied a wide screen and resolution fix, and many other little things. It doesn't replace the Ginput system with the Xinput system (for 360 and PS3 controllers) but there were many guides to replacing it in the community guides that I found in a few seconds. If you can't get your mods running just use the old no-cd patch, name it gta-vc.exe, and Steam will run it fine allowing CLEO and dependent mods to run. NOTE Vice City modders prefer the 1.0 no-cd exe for compatibility reasons but I chose to use the 1.1 exe, no particular reasons, so either works if you have picky mods or crashing. ♥♥♥♥ cheats, get VC Dream and forget about them.

												I love Vice City very much. It was my first in a long line of Grand Theft Auto games, and I couldn't have picked a better game. It sucks you in immediately with its music, sunsets, cars, music, and cast of celebrity voiced characters. It has just the right size of world to explore, from the beautiful sunsets of Ocean Beach, to the heavy Cuban and Haitian influence of Little Hati and Havana. Most of the missions have a laugh or two in them, even if some don't, you can just ignore it, chill out, and listen to the impeccable music on the radio. If you are wanting to play a Grand Theft Auto game, buy this one first. If you are looking for looking for a new game to play, buy this game. For any other reason at all, do yourself a favor and BUY THIS GAME!			"

												This game is still great to play, and will never get old for me. I don't really need to say much about it, except it has a kickass soundtrack, great atmosphere, and is really fun to play. I even like this one a little more than San Andreas because of the 80's feel it invokes.A couple of points down for the aiming which is a bit wonky on the PC (which can be fixed using a widescreen mod AFAIK) and the fact that Tommy, for being a badass and all that, can't swim. Just like Claude in GTA III. Other than that if you haven't played this I don't know what you're thinking. Do it. A special note about the whole trouble around this game's soundtrack and those of you thinking songs may be missing: Fear not. I bought the recent version of this game after it came back to Steam, and no songs were removed. It's all there. :)			"

												This is a golden oldy! In my oppinion one of the best GTA games. it's not the biggest, nor the best looking, but the story and setting is by far the best in the GTA series.In this game getting a 100% by looking for collectibles, secret jumps, etc. is not a drag but an opportunity to experience all the little quirks and jokes in the game.If you find this game for about €15,- you should definitely buy it! while some people think it's somewhat pricey for a game this old, the time you spend on it and the amusement you get from it is more than worth it!The downside is that there are a few bugs in the game when playing on windows 7 and higher. These bugs are rarely game breaking and often solvable by (ie. turning on the frame limiter- causes a bit lower FPS but in fairness it bring you to the fps the game was ment to play in)Final comments: A great game, somewhat old but 100% worth of your time if you're a fan of the 1960-70's and open world games.

Freedom to move, plotlines to follow, plenty of hidden tricks and secrets, but none of the stupid, grinding character-changing elements of its successors and imitators. It simply oozes 80s style, Miami Vice meets Scarface and has a party on Carlito's Way. And the radio is so good, I have literally sat in a car with a hooker listening to Chavez on VCPR.

												The 'Best' GTA game. It is the best GTA due to it's design. The concept is simple. Open world and there are missions. The missions introduce you to new features in the game, or you can explore and find them yourself. San Andreas has the same design but the expanded world does not accommodate the game feel. San Andreas, GTA 4 and GTA 5 all have bigger open worlds than Vice City and therefore more to do in a sense (more time to waste). As a game, Vice City is the perfect GTA. Because, the open world is big, but not big enough for you to lose your way. Vice City is more simple and therefore better as a game. I never found myself wasting my time in Vice City. In San Andreas, GTa 4 and 5, myself and even you, always find yourself drivng around aimlessly, killing random people...sure this can be ammusing at the very least, but it won't compel you to keep playing the game. Vice City is a smaller game in scale and therefore the games design works.75/100			"

												This is a golden oldy! In my oppinion one of the best GTA games. it's not the biggest, nor the best looking, but the story and setting is by far the best in the GTA series.In this game getting a 100% by looking for collectibles, secret jumps, etc. is not a drag but an opportunity to experience all the little quirks and jokes in the game.If you find this game for about €15,- you should definitely buy it! while some people think it's somewhat pricey for a game this old, the time you spend on it and the amusement you get from it is more than worth it!The downside is that there are a few bugs in the game when playing on windows 7 and higher. These bugs are rarely game breaking and often solvable by (ie. turning on the frame limiter- causes a bit lower FPS but in fairness it bring you to the fps the game was ment to play in)Final comments: A great game, somewhat old but 100% worth of your time if you're a fan of the 1960-70's and open world games.

												From 3 to Vice City even though this game was made in 8 Months after GTA 3 it is a much better game. The Vibe, Story, Graphics all of it sold this game for me. It is a fantastic experience. I liked the combat even though it wasn't too much improved from GTA 3. The Story is much better than 3 (The Main Character actually talks) and is a lot like the Movie Scarface. (Tommy Vircetti = Tony Montana pretty much)  The Radio has much more better tracks in my honest opinion.  (Even Michael Jackson is on the radio) The graphics were slightly better than 3 not too much improved but improved. The Missions range from assassinations to flying an RC helicopter or to being chased by a chef. Even if some missions are repetitive and annoying and if you fail it you have to DRIVE all the way back. The map is a 80's spoof of Miami, Flordia and it looks and feels fantastic. a All in all it is a fantastic experience and well worth the 10 dollars I spent on it. 8.5/10			"

												After playing GTA IV and GTA V, I had a problem going back to San Andreas. Something about it never seemed right. Vice City, however, it truly stood the test of time. I can still pick up this game and have a blast, going from mission to mission. While the story is not the most amazing thing in the world, it certainly offers enough to keep you engaged (at least the main missions do). This is a game I played a lot before I got my hands on GTA San Andreas, and I still find myself playing it on occasion.Do yourself a favor though, pick up the high-res mod to clean up the textures and get a proper fullscreen experience, and don't turn off the frame limiter. The game is funky about running higher then 30fps. (Though that can also be fixed with a patch)			"

												There is no GTA game quite like Vice City. San Andreas has more depth and functionality, and in the end more replay value, but Vice City is just so enamoring and engulfing, you don't want to leave. The music, the atmosphere, the people... the lights, the cars... the music. I wish Rockstar would release an updated version or a sequel.			"

												One of the best GTAs ever made. The characters are great and memorable, the map is big but small enough for you to remember where things are, which made me feel like I really knew Vice City. The game is incredibly challenging, however. I couldn't beat the game without using cheats, but the game still proved to be really enjoyable regardless.			"

												This game is the same age as a 13 year old at the time of this review and I've never played this game before at all. Yet despite its outdated graphics, akward controls, weird car physics and lack of a functional reverse on most cars, I still find some weird enjoyment out of this game.Maybe I just like old games? I don't know. If you like games set in the 80s or if you played these types of games growing up, then you would be stupid not to buy this game.			"

The songs in this game are amazing, even better than in San Andreas.The game runs fine for the most part, but I do suggest you check the requirements first and make sure you have the memory and space for the game. If you have it, get this game... a must play for any gamer or Grand Theft Auto fan			"

												Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.One of the best games in the 3D universe era of the GTA series. I used to play this game when I was younger. A portion of my childhood revolves around the classic GTA trilogy. When you're not on a mission, feel free to cause some havoc. Do whatever the hell you want without a care in the world, that is until the vigilance of the police puts a stop to your terror. The 1980's aesthetics and the overall atmosphere of the game are very pleasing to look at and the different radio stations you can listen to feature a lot of classic hits that are just wonderful to listen to as you play.I give this game a 9/10. Who cares if its graphics don't fit with today's style? Graphics don't determine if a game is good or not. It looks really nice, especially for its time, making its debut in late 2002. The early 2000's brought a lot of great games into existence, each unique and diverse in their own ways. GTA: Vice City has a lot of replay value with its various side missions, there's just so much you can do outside of the main story line. There's also 100 secret packages scattered throughout the world. Try to find them all, and you'll be rewarded handsomely with an arsenal of mass destruction and luxurious vehicles.My only problem with this game is that sometimes you can get stuck under a vehicle or rock and it's impossible to get out until you respawn or load the game from a save slot, and while there are a few other gamebreaking glitches, those only happen if the player makes them happen. Overall, this game is a bundle of fun and I definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't played a GTA game before or just for nostalgic purposes.			"

												Comming from a loooong time GTA fan/nerd, this particular entry in the series is ,by far, my favorite. Something about the atmosphere of Vice City is just so awe inspiring to me. It might stem from playing it when I was young, how ever I also played III and San Andreas and they nostaliga from them comes no where near as close as this one. Maybe its the sounds, the music. Maybe its the well written charecters. I just dont know. What I do know is that I love this game and it deserves it.			"

												Great GTA. Must have for fans. I grew up with Vice City Stories and it is great to see the original Vice City. GTA: Vice City offers quite possibly one of the best GTA maps of the franchise. The game, in my opinion, seems heavily infuenced by the movie Scarface. Has a great selection of songs to listen to whilst taking over the city in an 80's Miami Beach environment. I can't English.			"

												The second GTA game i played back in the day. Vice City came out on the PC in 2003, i picked it up and played it somewhere around 2005 to 2007. Quite possibly my favorite GTA of all time. Im a sucker for anything 80's so that further heightened the experience of this game. If you haven't played this one i would highly recommened playing it.The story is more intereresting than GTA 3 imo; it takes alot of cues from 80's films, and television. The aesthetics of the world really work in its favor and really makes you feel like your in the 80's. The various car designs, the npcs, and even the many easteregg references (Scarface mansion, Miami Vice music and cops) really addon to it.The gameplay is still the same from its predecessor. You have the ability to jump, run, sprint and crouch like GTA 3. There are new weapons in this GTA; compared to GTA3 having one set of weapons, GTA Vice City has atleast 4 sets of weapons from small to heavy.For the music you have yet again a really well picked soundtrack. You have a combination of 80's hip hop to Rock, to Newwave and Synthpop. The sound effects were well made for its time. As for the voice acting you have a couple of celebrities (Ray Liotta as Tommy Vercetti) Dennis Hopper, Burt Reynolds, Gary busey etc essentially a top notch performance and an interesting choice to have them voice the characters given their backgrounds.All in all, its well worth the money and its another great GTA experience.

												I'm giving this game a good review, only because it is a classic Grand Theft Auto game and deserves recognition. Other than that, it performs horribly on a modern PC. You can say I have high standards, but the outdated settings and bugs make the game unplayable. The mouse sensitivity is extremely high, to the point that turning it all the way down doesn't help, it's maximum resolution is about a quarter of any screen made after 2006, and overall the controls are awkward and irritating. I'm sure there are mods out there to update the feel of the game, but for a user who wants it to be working right out of the box, they'll find themselves largely disappointed.			"

												I never liked this game at first, I just wanted to get through all the classic GTA's before the PC release of GTA V. After all the fun was done with GTA V, I started to think back to the atomsphere and the world I had left behind in Vice City. Naturally I went back to it and I ended up really liking the game a lot more. The music, the world and the atomsphere all just meshes together well. The game can be a bit stubborn sometimes with the missions, but if you push through you'll be rewarded with a great story.The game is always and still remains a true classic. Worth a buy.			"

												Alright you sexy beasts, when you start up GTA VC, does it say ""error 640x480 missing""? Well then luckly for you I have the power of google. So first off you amazingly hot people, you gotta go to This PC -->  Local Disk ----> Program Files (x86) -----> scroll down a little bit and go to Steam ----> SteamApps -----> common -----> find your GTA VC file through all of your other sexy games -----> right-click the icon that says ""gta-vc"" or ""gta-vc.exe"" ----> Click properties -----> click compatibility ----> turn off  ""640x480 screen resolution"" and change the ""8-bit (256) color"" to ""16-bit (65536) color"". Now it should work. This only helps people with the ""640x480 missing"" thing. If this doesn't work, Google search the way that works for you.   <3			"

												The best GTA game, hands down. Well, unless V is good but after IV.. Anyhow, the game is great, it's funny, it's got a PERFECT 80's atmosphere, with probably the most kickass soundtrack in a game. The radio has some witty banter, but the music is the best part. The graphics are a little aged but you can install some graphical mods if you're willing to learn a little bit about modding. The game is best played with a controller, but otherwise, it's Grand Theft Auto, the story is the best out of all of them, it's got likable characters and movie references all around. Everyone says San Andreas and IV are the best, but I can tell you, anyone who has played Vice City will tell you different. Just give it a go, most modern computers can run it and it's pretty cheap. If you're a fan of the series, do NOT pass this up. No complaints besides maybe it could do with a little better kb+m support.  9.8/10.			"

												The 3D Grand Theft Auto that got me hooked. I was a fan of the original GTA on the Playstation. When I got older, I got the GTA III/ Vice City two pack for Xbox. I wasn't a big fan of III, but Vice City was, and still is, awesome. I love the setting. The music, the clothes, the culture, it's all cool. If you play this on the PC, I would recommend two mods. First is ginput, which allows you to play the game with the 360 controller. Make sure you download the extra stuff so it uses the same controls as GTA IV. The second is the widescreen patch. It fixes the aiming issues I was having while using widescreen mode.			"

												The game is fantastic but in the latest windows it needs some tweeking before you start.It also needs a seperate one off program to be able to use a gamepad the way it plays on consoles.While you can look around you while walking around, this is not the 360 free camera roam case while driving around. While driving you can only look forward, backward, left and right; but not around you! This is very limited.While the soundtrack is amazing and gives you that 80s nostalgia feel, it is somewhat limited/repetitive.I recommend this game and I rate it 8/10, but setting it up is a pain in the backside so I will rate it 6/10 just because Rockstar are a pain by not supporting their old games to make them compatible for people who buy it now.So yeah 6/10 or 3 out of 5stars. I still recommend it though. Try and get it in the sales.			"

												The game of my childhood and obviously the best Gta ever made. This game got all you want : a rich storyline, a game taking place in miami, a nice retro background, and high end graphics (when it was released).  This game really revolutionized the action and open world genre. Controls were better than Gta 3, physics were better than Gta 3, a real step forward.  The only Flop is that the steam version is trashy. Briefly this  game is a real gold mind for everyone that welcomes action and open world genre. A Guarenteed-Cult Game 10/10 "

												One of the best GTA games second only to San Andreas imo.Considering it used the same engine as GTA 3, Rockstar really polished the ♥♥♥♥ outta this game by improving pretty much everything mechanics wise, like the cars longer being insanely dangerous to drive, better gunplay, flying, etc. It also introduced cool little things that are still present in current GTAs like buying properties. Vice City excels in atmosphere above anything else. Nothing like driving down Washington Beach at night listening to Flash fm to make you feel immersed. The graphics are very stylish with pretty lighting effects specially prominent at night. It also helps that the game has amazing radio stations that also give a bit of backstory to recurring radio stars in the franchise, like Laslow. Vice City feels very alive.Plot pretty much feels like a tribute to Scarface, this is clearly visible in the last mission. There's references to Carlito's Way and Miami Vice. The story features memorable characters and awesome moments with one of the best protagonists in the franchise. Tommy Vercetti is a ♥♥♥♥ing boss. I hope the next GTA takes us back to a remastered Vice City in the HD universe.			"

												The game is fantastic but in the latest windows it needs some tweeking before you start.It also needs a seperate one off program to be able to use a gamepad the way it plays on consoles.While you can look around you while walking around, this is not the 360 free camera roam case while driving around. While driving you can only look forward, backward, left and right; but not around you! This is very limited.While the soundtrack is amazing and gives you that 80s nostalgia feel, it is somewhat limited/repetitive.I recommend this game and I rate it 8/10, but setting it up is a pain in the backside so I will rate it 6/10 just because Rockstar are a pain by not supporting their old games to make them compatible for people who buy it now.So yeah 6/10 or 3 out of 5stars. I still recommend it though. Try and get it in the sales.			"

												So my review about GTA Vice City, I played this game since 2006 or so, back in the day it was the CD version, you needed 2 CDs one to install and one to play. It was such a great experience. It really made fun. I would give this game a 9 out of 10! Starting of with the good aspects:+ The feeling: you really feel like you are in the 80´s + The Soundtrack: Driving down the Highway listening to For little diamonds.. so awesome..+ The Story: Based on Scarface and Miami Vice it was just awesome to play it for yourself and become a Drug Boss and Bankrobber, just awesome+ The Main Charakter: Tommy Vercetti, you play as a Killer, a Thieb etc. but you are still charming and always leave your note, you know how to make someone talk, but you also know how to talk to a lady (even though you dont really do this)+ The Side Charakters: They just fit perfectly :) So the negative aspects: -  Swimming and Climbing: You can´t do this you cant swim and you cant climbe/ take cover or something like this. How you could later in GTA San AndreasSo over all: If you are no little child and dont care about the graphics (they are still awesome for the time)and you didnt play this game yet go buy it and play it it is awesome and you will have a good time.

												First off... This is the best GTA of the 3rd generation!This game is really good looking despite it's old age, This, unlike GTA SA, runs in full 1080p which is good!Textures, models, peds etc look a bit dated but I can forgive this for it's awesome storyline which is more enjoyable than some games released today-- However! I have a few issues... This game has many issues with multi-monitor setups and for some reason, this runs better on my lower spec PC! Unsure why this is but I understand why these issues exist!10/10 - If you want the full GTA experience, you NEED this one!			"

												The game of my childhood and obviously the best Gta ever made. This game got all you want : a rich storyline, a game taking place in miami, a nice retro background, and high end graphics (when it was released).  This game really revolutionized the action and open world genre. Controls were better than Gta 3, physics were better than Gta 3, a real step forward.  The only Flop is that the steam version is trashy. Briefly this  game is a real gold mind for everyone that welcomes action and open world genre. A Guarenteed-Cult Game 10/10 "

												I genuinelly want to love Vice City. I honestly do. GTA in the 80's? HELL YEAH! That sounds amazing! The aethsthetic of the 80's with its beautiful color pallete mixed with the tight controls and fun of GTA 3 sounds amazing to me. Unfortunately, due to whatever reason, this is not it. GTA: Vice City, at least for the Steam PC edition, is not a game I recommend.Even with mutlitudes of mods its still broken and clunky. While the game still looks relatively good for its time, the models don't hold up. This wouldn't bother me if the controls were tight. Yet, they're awful. Not what'd I expect from a Rockstar title in my life. Vehicles handle fine BUT YOU CAN BARELY REVERSE. You need to reverse to properly drive in a game where driving is IN THE NAME. This means you have 2 options if your car crashes. Spend 10 minutes driving in reverse 10 iph (inches per hour) or cut your losses and get another car or bike with the same issue. Tommy also has the Olympic prowess of a Paralympic Long Jumper, moving relatively okay but taking Neil Armstrong leaps forward. Not the worst but felt it needed mentioning.Don't get me started on the abhorrent shooting. You can't take aim, which is much worse than you thinkk, but your crosshair IS A LIAR. You don't shoot where it is, you shoot slightly diagonally of where it is, meaing shots are unprecise and clunky to say the least. The only way to fight is through melee or praying to the lord of the 80's himself RIck Astley that your pistol lands a shot. Everything else is fine however. The voice acting is good, the graphics, though aged, look nice and feel like Miami. However, without good gameplay this doesn't matter. Until Rockstar either remakes Vice City, controls and all, or fixes this version, I can't recommend it in good faith, as it feels more like a $0.99 Early Access game from Digital Homicide or something, not a game in the same tree as GTA IV or V. I hate to say it but I don't want someone like me getting all hype and being dissapointed in what was probably, in all honestly, a good PS2 game badly ported.			"

												Vice City is a masterpiece. It has the graphics, it has the sound effects, it has a good storyline with rich and colourful characters. The main protagonist of the game is Tommy Vercetti the mafia's ♥♥♥♥♥ who was in jail for 15 years. So that makes him a jail ♥♥♥♥♥ too, because he always tells the same story about how he dropped the soap.  10/DohnkeyBrinkles. the end.			"

												Amazing game, but doesn't work at all for me. Getting the constant ""Unhandled Exception"" error, even if I add the gta_vc and testapp file to the DEP list. Such a shame. Just to note, my 9.2 hours was done on a previous computer. I recently wanted to come back to start the game again on my current system but I guess that's not happening. I'm also running on Windows 10.			"

Lots of side missions and activities make the game enjoyable. There is a lot of new weapons and vehicles in the game, as well as good radio stations.			"

												GTA Vice City set a new standard for all the titles in the series that proceeded it. It's my personal favourite title in the series and is of course very fun. A step up from GTA III, with a bright and vibrant palette, the inclusion of motorcycles and flyable aircraft, Vice City feels much more alive than Liberty City which came before it. The main story is also well done, with a very likable protagonist, Tommy Vercetti. Wreak havoc and have fun.			"

												The numerous bugs and glitches that plagued the PS2 version have been cleaned up and eliminated, for the most part. Enemies no longer shoot you through solid walls, you no longer randomly lose health while running, and cars remain in your garage until you take them out. The PC version of Vice City is just as much fun as the original, with great frame rates, better graphics, more control options, and all the content that made the PS2 version an instant classic. The mod community is still active and Vice City still works even on modern PC's unlike GTA IV which can be a pain to get working on a windows 8 and 10 machine. The controls can be a little frustrating at times when doing RC missions. Takes a little while to get the hang of it with keyboard and mouse, but if you have a gamepad, nothing to worry about. Still one of the best GTA games when it comes to story and voice acting. I am a saints row fan and most of the GTA's seem okay, but this one is fantastic. Who doesn't want to play as Ray Liotta? Your little version of Goodfellas. Still a classic and great game.			"

												Even after over ten years of break from playing the game. It just simply is the best GTA made in the series. Setting, musics, overall feeling is just so great. The city and surrounding areas are not too large so it isn't a modern sandbox game, instead everything is managable and city is very nice sized. Story is typical Hauser writing, but it works well here.Voice acting is top notch, with Ray Liotta leading the cast as the main character that you play as. The textures are from the early 2000's era, but if you can live with that, you are then ready for an ultimate experience in a great GTA world.			"

												    Okay, I recomend this game because out of all the GTA's, this one is the only one that you can find a fast car/bike on almost every street corner. The downside of it is that any time you hit a wall, even if you just tapped it, you fall of your bike. I really like fast cars/bikes, but you need it so the guy doesn't fall off so much. I like the beach, how when you go on it you slow down, and I also like how it's so large. The colors arn't very diffrent, and by that I mean that every color has the same tint to it, if you know what I mean. (I'll update this when I've played the storyline. Why I writing a reveiw right now is to talk about the quality in the game, and I don't think I need to have played the storyline to tell you that.) All in all, great game, lots of fun, and a must-buy. A great game if you want a taste of how GTA works. (Ah, before I forget, you can only play this with a keyboard. No touchscreen support.)P.S. If you think that because I havn't played this game for long I can't give a true review, you are wrong. I have played 100+ hours of San Andreas on the window's store, so I'm comparing it to that one in particular. I have also played every GTA (Exsept for the first two that were 2D) out there, so I know what I'm talking about.                                                                                                                                                                                                   -Secretgamer			"

												Nothing beats the memories of late nights with friends, auto-tuning to EMOTION 98.3 upon vehicle entry, taking turns doing progressively more outlandish 'runs' up and down the same stretch of road, barely dodging police tire strips at the last second, getting annoyed when the car catches fire in the middle of a great song, fleeing your busted ride while dodging unrelenting police AI and feeling that glimmer of hope when you spot an unexpected Cheetah nearby, only to have it slowly accelerate away just before you reach it, leaving you in a panic and forcing you to settle on a nearby Perennial station wagon, and when that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ police car that is designed to appear out of nowhere near intersections (to either t-bone you or have you t-bone it) causes you to flub your canal stunt jump setup juuuuust enough that you unsuccessfully land on the other side just mere inches short, you slowly rolling/sliding into the water, you know full well it's time to pass that controller to your friend because ol' Tommy Vercetti was never trained in the fine art of shallow water survival.

												Ah, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City... The 80's. Nothing like experiencing the 80s as it was in Rockstar's own version of Miami, Florida. I'll be one to say that this game was literally the bread and butter of my childhood (Yeah, I know. Rated M for Mature for a reason. Shut up.) I tried to play it so much during the hours I was awake. I have even tried to fake sick to stay home from school to play this game. But enough about me and my experiences. Here's my review. A list of pros and cons. (Although there aren't many cons, if any, but anyway...)Pros:-The StoryThe story in itself is great while it lasts.-The voice actingSure, this can be sketchy with some games. However, with Vice City, this is definitely not a worry.-Ray LiottaC'mon. It's Ray Liotta playing a mad man. What more could you want? It's perfect.-The atmosphereWith this game, I always felt that you got that 1980s vibe from this game as it really brings out what that era was like, in my honest opinion.-Ray f**king LiottaDid I mention this already?Now, the cons...Cons-Not being able to swimWe are all used to it by now, but in Grand Theft Auto III, we all thought it was non-sense. Even I did. And that's about the only con this game had.Overall score is 10/10Ray motherf**king Liotta.Okay, I'm leaving this here now.:D			"

												Though some of the later missions are savagely difficult, this is THE single player GTA that will stand the test of time.  The aesthetic and gameplay mesh wonderfully.  This is the best crimeland to drive around in, these are the best tunes to nod your head to.  A digital Ray Liotta is ready to take a samurai sword to random pedestrians whenever you are...			"

												GTA Vice City set a new standard for all the titles in the series that proceeded it. It's my personal favourite title in the series and is of course very fun. A step up from GTA III, with a bright and vibrant palette, the inclusion of motorcycles and flyable aircraft, Vice City feels much more alive than Liberty City which came before it. The main story is also well done, with a very likable protagonist, Tommy Vercetti. Wreak havoc and have fun.			"

												The numerous bugs and glitches that plagued the PS2 version have been cleaned up and eliminated, for the most part. Enemies no longer shoot you through solid walls, you no longer randomly lose health while running, and cars remain in your garage until you take them out. The PC version of Vice City is just as much fun as the original, with great frame rates, better graphics, more control options, and all the content that made the PS2 version an instant classic. The mod community is still active and Vice City still works even on modern PC's unlike GTA IV which can be a pain to get working on a windows 8 and 10 machine. The controls can be a little frustrating at times when doing RC missions. Takes a little while to get the hang of it with keyboard and mouse, but if you have a gamepad, nothing to worry about. Still one of the best GTA games when it comes to story and voice acting. I am a saints row fan and most of the GTA's seem okay, but this one is fantastic. Who doesn't want to play as Ray Liotta? Your little version of Goodfellas. Still a classic and great game.			"

												Even after over ten years of break from playing the game. It just simply is the best GTA made in the series. Setting, musics, overall feeling is just so great. The city and surrounding areas are not too large so it isn't a modern sandbox game, instead everything is managable and city is very nice sized. Story is typical Hauser writing, but it works well here.Voice acting is top notch, with Ray Liotta leading the cast as the main character that you play as. The textures are from the early 2000's era, but if you can live with that, you are then ready for an ultimate experience in a great GTA world.			"

												Ah, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City... The 80's. Nothing like experiencing the 80s as it was in Rockstar's own version of Miami, Florida. I'll be one to say that this game was literally the bread and butter of my childhood (Yeah, I know. Rated M for Mature for a reason. Shut up.) I tried to play it so much during the hours I was awake. I have even tried to fake sick to stay home from school to play this game. But enough about me and my experiences. Here's my review. A list of pros and cons. (Although there aren't many cons, if any, but anyway...)Pros:-The StoryThe story in itself is great while it lasts.-The voice actingSure, this can be sketchy with some games. However, with Vice City, this is definitely not a worry.-Ray LiottaC'mon. It's Ray Liotta playing a mad man. What more could you want? It's perfect.-The atmosphereWith this game, I always felt that you got that 1980s vibe from this game as it really brings out what that era was like, in my honest opinion.-Ray f**king LiottaDid I mention this already?Now, the cons...Cons-Not being able to swimWe are all used to it by now, but in Grand Theft Auto III, we all thought it was non-sense. Even I did. And that's about the only con this game had.Overall score is 10/10Ray motherf**king Liotta.Okay, I'm leaving this here now.:D			"

												A huge improvement in relation to GTA III. The 80's are an amazing set for this Grand Theft Auto storyline, and Tommy Vercetti is simply a boss. I feel the story could be better but going against mafia and other rival gangs while listening to ""When the Beat Goes On"" is phenomenal. Totally recommend you play through this game if you haven't, even though it shows some age in 2015. Still worth it.

												best of the GTA series, easily!+tons of purchasable property that generates income or furthers the story(only old school gamers will understand why its a good thing to actually have to make some effort and be somebody important ingame to progress)+missions on said properties to unlock income generation or special bonuses+everything you do counts towards completion(stunt jumps, robbing stores, random side missions) something they seem to have forgotten about in newer games. i mean they are there but they dont count towards anything, so they are ultimately pointless. +everything you do is rewarding. for example, 100% completion unlocks things, doing ambulance missions, fire truck missions, give you perks. collecting packages gives you perks. things are actually rewarding. as the GTA series has progressed things have been less and less rewarding to where now you are just not rewarded at all for anything, its just optional things for ""fun"" or ""flavour"" b*llsh*t i want my actions to mean something. much more fun when you are actually rewarded for it.+ radio is amazing, the 80s were truly a great time to be alive+story is great, very well done, vercetti is an awesome character. much better than the trio of idiots in GTAV for sure. actually feels like a real character instead of you basically being a government hitman example: GTA:SA, GTAV (san andreas it only starts later on but you end up just being their ♥♥♥♥♥, as with GTAV the entire game your just the governments slave) with the exception of GTA4 where you are a badass ruski. although you do work with government/police a little bit, its minimal compared to the other two. yeah yeah i know its realistic but i dont care. i want to arrive in a city and make a name for myself like vercetti did. run♥♥♥♥♥♥and be a badass, not be a f*cking tool.+ controls are actually better than any of the newer games. the AI and phsyics are awful as to be expected from an old game such as this, but flight controls and mechanics, boat and vehicle controls are much better, even if they are way too responsive (you can make impossibly sharp turns in cars and boats) its actually much more fun that way.11/10!!

												I had fond memories of GTA:VC, thus I purchased the game. But when I played it again, I realized that the game didn't age well. Nonetheless, GTA:VC is, in my opinion, still the best entry in the GTA series. The locations, the beach and the sun makes you think more about your next vacation than about what is going on in the game, the retro style is cheesy but cool, and the characters may not be as realistic as the protagonists of later entries, but they are way more fun. Another thing I noticed is that the driving mechanics aren't realistic at all, but as a result driving a car down Vice City's streets provides more fun than ""realistic"" controls ever could. I still love the game, but I could not bring myself to play it more than two hours. I know that it is a superficial reason, but I couldn't stand the old graphics anymore.			"

												This game is more than twelve years old. I have only played about half an hour of it. And yet, it still has better voice-acting than many games up through this year. This is why Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is on my ""Golden Age of Games"" list.			"

												A huge improvement in relation to GTA III. The 80's are an amazing set for this Grand Theft Auto storyline, and Tommy Vercetti is simply a boss. I feel the story could be better but going against mafia and other rival gangs while listening to ""When the Beat Goes On"" is phenomenal. Totally recommend you play through this game if you haven't, even though it shows some age in 2015. Still worth it.

												Following the success of Grand Theft Auto, developer Rockstar North takes gamers on a tour of a new city in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. With new sights, new characters, new (ahem) business opportunities, and even a whole new '80s themed era, players can indulge in more criminal fun than ever before.Vice City features more expansive locations, and over 120 vehicles ripe for the picking such as exotic cars, motorcycles, luxury yachts and planes. The soundtrack boasts three times the tunes compared to the previous GTA, and features countless '80s hits. Over 40 different weapons ensure effective firepower and provide enough variety for stylish defensive measures (samurai sword anyone?). "

												So this game has alot of things and emotions attached to it. You can do the same thing like every other Grand Theft Auto games, but you cant swim :(      Enough of that. Ive missed this game alot since ive had it on the PS2 many years back. All the characters like Vinny and Vance Lance and etc are like attached feeling through a video game. Its many years old i know that but its still pretty fun if you are on the lookout of trying some of the old school GTA games. I would recommend this a try. Its fun, action packed and really cool to try with the old Rockstar game engines			"

												This game is a brilliant classic. I prefer this over San Andreas. Handles the same as San Andreas and virtually the exact same graphics yet the visuals colour pallet is far more varied and popping and the radio which I really like. Also the learning curve is not as sharp as San Andreas and the controls are very easy to get the hang off.			"

												So this game has alot of things and emotions attached to it. You can do the same thing like every other Grand Theft Auto games, but you cant swim :(      Enough of that. Ive missed this game alot since ive had it on the PS2 many years back. All the characters like Vinny and Vance Lance and etc are like attached feeling through a video game. Its many years old i know that but its still pretty fun if you are on the lookout of trying some of the old school GTA games. I would recommend this a try. Its fun, action packed and really cool to try with the old Rockstar game engines			"

												**TO ALL WHO ARE HAVING MOUSE ISSUES WITH THIS GAME**1. Run the game.2. Start Task Manager (Ctrl+Alt+Delete).3. Highlight the game then right click.4. Click ""Go To Process"".(should take you to the ""Processes"" page with GTA already highlighted)5. Right click the game and click on ""Set Affinity"".6. Then it's going to ask you ""Which Processors Are Allowed To Run?"".with the options to check on or off:_<All Processors>_CPU 0_CPU 1_CPU 2_CPU 37. Check <All Processors> off and only check on one CPU, doesn't matter which one, but I always just go with the first one: CPU 0.8. Click ""OK"" when chosen, close the Task Manager and click back on the game and all should be well.9. None of this will work if the game isn't already running before you open the Task Manager.**Note: This is the fix for Windows XP, Vista & 7, I do not own 8, but I would assume it's very similar, if not.. there's always YouTube lol**""other than that bulls**t and the fact that they took off some of the best songs in the game, it's still absolutely amazing to now own this on Steam, memories dog, memories""			"

												After some thought, I had to come back and change my review. After reading other reviews I came to realize that I can't reccomend this game, at least not the steam version. Yes, it is a great game that will always hit a soft spot for me, but the way Rockstar has neglected the PC version is disappointing. The least they could do is update it to the Xbox version's graphics, or get GTA 3 to even work on newer systems (or to get this title to work without the 30 fps cap). But instead they only concentrate on how to push microtransactions in GTA5 Online (cars available in online only and not single play really lets me down). Really, over time it just shows more and more how Rockstar just loves money and not truely the fans of their games. If you really want this game do like I did, wait for a sale. My original review is below.I wish this was more of a port of the xbox version, or it got an anniversary update, with their graphical enhancements, but since I played this on PS2 anyway it deffinitly fills the nostalgia void. Especially since I have packed my PS2 away, it's easier to just open it up on steam, plus I get to play the story through one more time.			"

												Unlike seemingly all other reviews of this game I had never played any of the playstation era GTAs; I had heard many times that this (or San Andreas) was the best GTA so I decided that it was worth having a go at, and without the nostalgia of having played this in its prime its clear that this game has aged very poorly. I don't mind the graphics or technical issues (the mouse acceleration is absolutely absurd) but the gameplay in general is just not fun; it's more of the ""go here, shoot this"" that practically all games share today but without the finese that all games share today; and that could be a good thing; older games often controlled and played poorly but did so in a way that made it feel unique (see Resident Evil, MGS3, Silent Hill, Thief, all the Interplay games, etc) but this simply feels like rushed design. Not to mention this games countless attempts at humor that just feel raunchy for raunchyness' sake without being funny.Every review I've read mentions the music and yes, this game has great music. But I can listen to music without playing a game.			"

												If you are looking for Grand Theft Auto Vice City, then you've come to the wrong place. This game is but a mere shadow of what gta vice city was back in the day. It is filled with game-breaking bugs and glitches which will drive you up the wall. For instance, based off of my experience with this mess, vehicles could not reverse, some important characters would freeze during missions, cutscenes and various other things such as vehicles or characters will be dead silent due to missing audio files, the framerate would drop below 20 to 10 fps (even with my GTX 970 4GB v-ram), the game would constantly crash, save files would not work, the game was missing various textures, and alot of visual bugs alongside control issues with the mouse/keyboard. Rockstar, I have one thing to say to you, and one thing only. You should be ashamed of yourselves. I, and many others, gave you our money, and you gave us this. But I digress, if you are looking for GTA Vice City, then you've come to the wrong place. Get a ps2, get GTA VC for the ps2, and enjoy the ride. Or even get the ps3 version of Vice City (If that one is not a mess too). ...........also the more recent versions of this game (ps3/pc) are missing alot of music because copyright.....			"

												Vice City is one of the best if not THE best GTA.The sound track is awesome. The story isn't bad either. This game and Scarface share a lot of similarities with one another. I believe that was on purpose and why not that was also an awesome film.Unfotunately the control scheme on this PC version is utter dogsh*t. There is supposed to be controller support but it is totally f*cked. Get on a bike using a controller and the bike sways from side to side as the game struggles to make heads of tails of the buttons on the controller and fails.The controls really ruins the experience. I LOVE this game but I can't recommend this version to you. Sure there are controller mods but they shouldn't be necessary and it seems to me to be hit and miss whether the mod will even work.I would honestly suggest buying the game and then playing it on an emulator. So you have the moral high ground in the sense that you didn't just steal the game but you get a better version. That will have proper controller support and will possible look better with the emulator upscalers.			"

												Now I remember why I couldn't finish the game back in time... and why I didn't like GTAs until very soon. In Vice City, the controls are just f*cked up, pushing the difficulty way too high. One of the FIRST mission is to destroy a building with small helicopters... had to redo the mission maybe 10 times. At the middle of the game, one of the mission is to recover some drug cases, with a time limit and with multiple SWAT troops / spike strips coming from nowhere... just impossible, unless you redo the mission maybe 50 times... or with cheat codes. And I am not a noob...The rest of the game is like all GTAs : take a car, go there, shoot them, take a car, chase them, take the case, go there... etc. No intellectual challenge, no surprises. Even the scenario is so so... The best GTAs are still (in order) 5 then 4, as the controls are much better, and the level of details also higher. They are also more different in their missions.Really, this Vice City was overrated back in time - even if it has some new really good features (open world for example) - and it is much worse playing it today...

The video scenes take about 2 minutes to load. I can't even turn on my xbox controller or my character will be going around in circles. Keeps crashing. Waste of time and money...			"

												This game was always amazing for PS2 and old PC's, but unfortunately, Steam didn't made a decent installation that covers mostly glitches that we'll face using newer systems and PC's.It took a decent time to fix the game and even like that, trying all mentioned ""workarounds"" in internet, the game still becoming crazy after setting Frame Limiter off, so, playing with 30FPS is totally weird and destroy the gaming experience.

It's unplayable.It makes my mouse's sensibility go higher on the Y axis than on the X axis. Tried googling it, downloaded some mods, tried changing settings but nothing.Regardless of the port, I think this game is outstanding, and deserves to be played at least once, so with all the GTAs.

												Well, it's good old (fantastic!) GTA-VC, what is left to say? But be warned that on Windows 7 and 8 it's **very** buggy. Crashes frequently, sometimes loses mouse input, and on notebooks it doesn't on a secondary monitor, as it doesn't support all monitor resolutions beware that it may trigger a Windows/Intel bug that leakes memory (and then crashes) unless you change your to desktop to same resolution as you intend to run GTA.

												Every now and then i buy an old classic that i missed at the time in the hope it will still kick♥♥♥♥♥today. You win some, you lose some. I remember loving the ads for this game. Hearing all those great tunes and watching your guy drive around in a Ferrari like Sonny Crocket was magical. Unfortunately, after almost 12 years of anticipation, i realize the actual gameplay isn't.I think the biggest problem is that it is a console game. The save system is absolutely abysmal. You need to drive 5 minutes to some out-of-the way checkpoint to save, then you need to spend another 5 minutes driving back to the guy who gives you your mission, then your mission sends you 5 minutes driving somewhere else, then if you die on your mission, you are forced to repeat 10+ minutes of garbage time just to get where you were when the action started. This would have been bad enough in 2001, but in 2015 when there are thousands of other games on Steam it's unforgivable. Woeful checkpoint system aside, the mouselook is really jerky and it's almost impossible to aim your guns or fight on foot. Pretty much the only thing that rocks in this game is driving around aimlessly in a Ferrari listening to synthpop, and then i might as well just be watching Miami Vice in the first place.			"

												If you want to play this game on Steam, you firstly need to damage your brain and do some serious research and annoying manupilations with game files in order to make the game actually work. Then, you might face another problem, broken mouse sensivity, which has been an issue for a big part of users since 2005 (!). I made some big research and found 0 real solutions to this problem, although there are tons of forum topics. But if course, we know Rockstar, and we know how they fix their bugs — they just don't. So don't you dare to buy this game, because it's simply unplayable			"

Glad I got this on sale, would be a lot more annoyed otherwise. And some gamepad support would have been nice.			"

But that wouldn't help because with the poor camera work and irritating movement you can't complete some of those quite difficult quests.The pluses are for the funny characters, radio tracks and interesting quests, but the above minuses took a lot from me to enjoy the game.

												**New Review (old one below)**I don't know why, maybe it's the story, or the setting. But for some reason I'm giving this one another try, and recording my play through of it. Apparently one of the problems I had (which no one brought up here) is that trying to play this and GTA III in wide screen messes with your aiming a lot. Also I just can't stand the system controlls, they get far to clunky when you need them the most. So far, after fixing the game again, and going back to PC controlls, I've played up to just before the last Cortez mission before he takes off. No deaths, and aiming is much improved. Hope the gun bugs don't come back to haunt me again. (PS2 version your guns can randomly lock up and get you killed.) But those Helicopter controls WTF!? So clunky. Any fixes for this? So far I have W to go up S to go down, A and D lean, and then I have to use, on my numpad 9 to go foreword and 4 and 5 to turn.****Original Review****Just like GTA III. You need to fix this game just to make it playable, and even then there are so many unfair and bull♥♥♥♥♥♥missions, you can't win without cheating. Fix this mess, or stop selling it. You should be better than this RockStar, You shoul be better than this!			"

												While this game is great, the Steam versions are riddled with massive glitches that make it nearly unplayable. Either Steam hates Rockstar or Rockstar hates Steam, as this is the only reason that can explain how insanely difficult it is to get some of these classics to work on newer OS and graphics cards. Ever single one of these Steam ports (III, Vice City, and VI) has some serious glitch that requires far more tweeking and adjustments to the launch settings than necessary. And not once has either Steam or Rockstar done a single thing to fix any of them. Instead, you buy an unplayable game, one that won't even start up, one that you cannot get a refund on, and neither company gives a damn. It's the equivalent of buying a hard copy game, opening it up, and realizing there is a manufacturer error that makes it unusable, and both the manufacturer and the merchant who sold it to you have an attitude of ""Oh well, you got what you paid for, sucks to be you. Don't bother asking us to fix it, we don't care."" And before you think this is just one person's system issues, go look in the forum at how many people can't get the game to start and how there is zero assistance from Steam or Rockstar, as neither are trying to solve these issues or fix the digital copies they fraudulently sold people, knowing full and well that it did not work with a newer OS. Compound that with the fact that these problems have been ongoing for almost 4 YEARS with no real resolution, and you can understand why I cannot recommend this version of GTA Vice City to anyone.

PROS:+ fantastic & cool story+ amazing soundtrack+ very fun gameplay+ lots of side missions+ no Rockstar Games Social ClubCONS:- sometimes clunky combat- falling into water still kills you- compatibility issues with newer OS- lots of glitches - audio, graphic- mouse control issues- game freezing in menusComment:With a heavy heart I have to explain why I cannot recommend getting this game on Steam. The game itself is great even though there are issues with it. The most apparent issues are with compatibility, mostly on Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10. Problems ranging from audio and graphic glitches ... screen/game freezing .. to mouse controls not working properly. But you could expect these for an old game and many (if not all) can be fixed by adding fixes/workarounds. Now to the core of the game. I remember it fondly playing it over a decade ago. The gangster story, all the vehicles there for you to use, cool missions and side-missions, adult humor. To this day I remember all the little details about it. Yes, the combat was and still is clunky but who cares when it is fun. An added bonus is that you do not have to deal with RGSC in this game. The game is awesome and is missing just a bit more polish to be as good as the sequel - San Andreas. But just like SA it suffers from licensing and how Rockstar treats digital distribution of games. Because you DO NOT OWN IT when you buy it here, you just borrow it. They might change the game when they wish and as recent events have shown they can remove stuff. Songs, options, fixes and in this way also all of the mods made throughout the years. Sometimes they swap it with a mobile port entirely. Vice City already had stuff removed and this will go on in the future. So as time goes your copy of the game on Steam gets worse and worse ... while old disk copies and even pirated versions remain the best quality available. THIS is why I do not recommend buying it here.			"

												GTA Vice City If you played it but your memory is shady and you wish for some nostalgia. go ahead graphics are bad considered today's time and controls are clunky ,its a bad port . you will need to be able to accelerate your x mouse axis 7 times the amount of y axis if you want to have a 1:1 ratio. =D "

												The game itself is alright but one thing that pisses me off in all of these GTA games is the camera. Unlike in other games like Smite where you use the mouse to look everywhere, in this game you cannot look or move in certain ways. I was never informed of this and purchased the games because of all of the hype and how it reminded me of True Crime: Streets of LA. I unfortunately cannot refund or find a solution to my problems so, save yourself. Don't listen to the hype and go spend your money on Outlast and Whistleblower. Both are much better games in comparison.			"

												My thumbs down is for this steam version being unplayable because of random crashes, otherwise this is one of the best games ever made, if not the single best. Despite being unplayable because of crashing, I gave a review below of my experience of this game from the Playstation 2 days. I don't recommend buying this on steam because you will probably have problems launching it and probably have crashes in-game. The game wouldn't launch so I messed around with DEP. That didn't work. So I tried using the DEP on the testapp.exe file and it didn't work. I then set the testapp.exe to run in windows xp service pack 3 mode and as administrator and the game finally worked. However after playing for about an hour, the game gave me the same crash error that it did when I was trying to launch it before which is a ""unhandled exception"" error. I set it to Windows 7 compatibility mode and it will now run again but probably not for long until it gives me that crash error. So basically I will not fk around with this anymore. That and you need to fix your Y sensitivity outside of the game because it is way too high in the game. I had to enable X and Y sensitivity sliders in my Razer Synapse software and set the Y sensitivity all the way down to 300 while leaving the X at 1300. Because of awful crash trouble, I can't recommend anyone to buy this. What I do recommend is buy a PS2 and this game and have a blast because it is worth it. Or PCSX2 and a rom.What's to say? It is simply one of the best games ever made, and one of the most important. It helped change how games were made and made people rethink what a video game really is. And of course the most awesome part, the soundtrack. One of the best ever. Imo it's pretty much the only GTA game to have a good soundtrack. The soundtracks to 3, 4, and 5 are garbage, and San Andreas only has a few good tunes. I remember being absolutely blown away by this game when it was released all those years ago and I had it for my Playstation 2. I've been a gamer since the 80's and I have seen and played a lot, and very few games have ever blown me away like this one did. Some of the most fun I have ever had was with this game. And a 19 yr old girl. Nothing but good memories. Of course games now are far better quality, but for its time, this game was phenomenal, and it still holds up well and is still fun to play. It showcases some of the best 80's music that there is and captures 80's Miami perfectly. Great weapons, great missions (mostly), a lot of fun killing everyone, driving fast, driving boats and helicopters, and the map layout is great. Vice City is a awesome place to be.			"

												Unplayable. The game in itself is amazing. But the Steam port is AWFULL.(Well anyway brainless haters gonna red thumb down because they don't understand this game have horrible issues)So after a few attemps, i finally had the game to start. I wanted to load a save.. Only to find out whatever i do, the game don't load it but create a new game. Then, the cars are bugged. Their brake are stuck. I can barely use them to move forward, but very slowly. Whenever i drop W, the car instantly apply handbrake. Same goes for reserve as i simply can't go in that direction. Brake are applied and the car don't move a single centimeter. Also huge glichtes with firearms, where the aiming is total random : bullet can go straight in one's head and he won't die, you can headshoothim by firing beside his head.For these reason, i cannot recommand any Grand Theft Auto game on steam, including GTA III, San Andreas and GTA IV aswell.

												Dear Steam-   What the ♥♥♥♥! I bought this game a year ago and it woked fine! Now the game doesn't even start! There is no reason for this to be happening! I am dissapointed with you steam and rockstar. This is a great game with no windows vista, 7, or 8 support! what the hell? It worked fine before on this computer until it stopped having compatibility for the newer windows operating systems. My opinion is to either not buy the game at all, or wait until it has windows support again. Because it is uneededly hard to boot this game up! For some people (including ME) its impossible! This is the best GTA game with no support! So the guys who have to wait for GTA V cant play any of the better GTA games! This is unacceptable and it needs to be patched in the near future or i want my money back.			"

												I barely sat down with this game for two sessions and had pretty much beaten the main missions. The driving somehow feels more cartoony than GTA III and for the most part, I can't see any major improvements from the previous. They added motorcycles and helicopters, but that alone isn't enough to save this game from extreme mediocrity. The story is also pretty stupid and it reminded me why I skipped all the cutscenes when I played this on the PS2.I personally think if you just play III and SA, you'll be set on your classic GTA's.

												Don't bother buying this game if you're planning on using a xbox controller or your keyboard and mouse, absolute trash controls.  Haven't tried w/ a Playstation controller but I'm assuming it's just as bad.  If you're using a xbox controller, you can't use the left/right trigger or the d pad.  If you're using the keyboard and mouse, the sensitivity is horrible.  If you adjust the sensitivity it'll only affect the x-axis and the y-axis will still be insanely sensitive making it incredibly difficult to aim.  I'm just gonna stick to my Playstation version.			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 3 thousand26four, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very large sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

BEWARE, LIKELY INCOMPATIBLE WITH YOUR WINDOWS OSJust like its predecessor, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City became the best selling video game of the year (2002), garnering praise for its story and open-ended gameplay, but also criticism for recurring violent and sexual themes.Unfortunately, the game is unlikely to run on any modern computers.  The game's readme does not even list Windows Vista, let alone later operating systems.  The following fixes failed to start the game:1. Replace/Delete .set file from GTA Vice City User Files.2. Turn off Data Execution Prevention for both gta-vc.exe and testapp.exe.3. Run gta-vc.exe and testapp.exe in compatibility mode.4. Run gta-vc.exe and testapp.exe as administrator directly from game files.However, if you still need your GTA fix, Grand Theft Auto V should do the trick.			"

The only redeeming quality about the game is the funny characters, fun 80s setting, 80s music, scarface references, and easter eggs.     The animations are awful and extremely comical. The sound quality is like something out of the 80s.     The console versions are slightly better than the PC version.   PC 3/10    PS2: 4/10   Xbox: 4/10   "

												This isn't a review of the specific game but a warning that may not work if you are using a modern PC. The game's engine is connected with the game's framerate, thus framerate limiter needs to be on for the game to work properly. If you don't have the limiter on the game appears to run smoothly but your car will be moving slower, and you will not be able to back up in the car (this applies to all vehicles, this makes the boat missions impossible, and any racing mission is impossible). There are also varous glitches that happen during missions because the engine wasn't design to be played at a high framerate. So why not play with the framerate limiter on? Well for me the game looks horribly choppy with it on, with noticable drops in frames continously. The game may work better if you have an old processor or graphics card possibly? I would recommend just getting it on the PS2 where you know it will work and you will have better controls too!			"

I'm afraid the sequels are far superior in every way. The game is better than GTA III but hasn't come that far along, San Andreas on the other hand is superior to this game for it's story and graphics. Overall don't buy this unless you are on some kind of mission to play it or blinded by nostalgia.8/15 - ""All later games are better, all past games are worse.""			"

However, taking off the frame-limiter essentially breaks the game and vertical mouse sensitivity is astronomically high and unchangable making the game unplayable with a mouse, throw in a lack of 360 controller support and you're in for a rough time. 3rd party software can ease your troubles but it's a real headache.

												On the playstation 2 I absolutely loved GTA:Vice city. Before I get into particulars i'll broad-stroke the premise. GTA: Vice city was launched for the PS2. It can best be described as a sandbox adventure game. Youre given various missons and objectives by people and advance the game by completing these missions. Theres not a whole lot of missions aside from the main story but who needs sidequests when you are wreaking havock at every turn?       A large part of this game is the fun you make for yourself. Walking into this I was very excited to relive some old memories with crispy graphics, tiny load times and nearly endless draw distance. What I found was just that, except for a few small details that ended up being big problems. Remember on the good ol' PS2 when you would boot up Vice City and you had the time to walk away, get some snacks, maybe use the bathroom and sit back down and only have to wait a few moments more for the initial load? No more! Load times and load zones are no longer an issue here.       So was pretty stoked. I couldnt wait to see all(or most) of vice city rendered as once in the highest of resolutions. And this game delivered that for me too. It was a wonderful trip down memory lane, that is, until I had to take control of the main character. Unfortunately, the controls dont translate well to mouse and ketboard. At first it wasnt a problem, I used a ps3 controller. There are too many commands that have to be mapped to too many buttons, it wont let you have the same controls that you did on the PS2 version. I tried many different control schemes and ideas but none worked the way I really wanted them to. Eventually I gave up.          There ARE programs and doodads that you can use that should give you a better expierience with the controls. Also, vice city is very playable as is, out-of-the-box. I just couldnt get comforable with any controll schemes I tried.  If youre looking for a GTA game you can play on an older computer I'd reccomend GTA:San Andreas. It's slightly more easier to play on mouse and keyboard. If you are looking for a little bit of nostalgia, you would be better off booting up you PS2, and digging out your old copy.			"

Being able to steal any vehicle you see was a huge leap forward in video gaming.This game, Vice City, was a mere 1 Year after the release of this technology.Sure they used basically the same engine and just made it a little better.But the point is, I had fun...again. and again. and again.I sometimes find myself coming back to play it instead of GTA V, just for a bit of nostalgia value but also the storyline is quick and action packed.I love being able to beat a pedestrian to a pulp then watching the paramedics revive them, only to be beaten to a pulp again....revived....beaten....revived...beaten...does this make me sick?anyway, I had fun, maybe you will too.Its 80's , looks like it belongs in the 80's, but if can deal with old graphics, you will probably have some fun.If you don't like 80's music, this game probably isn't for you.Maybe go play some gansta♥♥♥♥♥♥instead.

												GTA: Vice City is set in the most magical time period of the whole Grand Theft Auto series. It has a certain charm that the other games certainly haven't accomplished to the same degree. The soundtrack is one of the most beautiful, and breathtaking soundtracks in all of gaming. The radio commentators are hilarious and witty, and they accompany the music wonderfully. Fernando Martinez from Emotion 98.3 is a prime example of this, constantly commenting about the way he flirts with women, and other things. The gameplay of this game has always been incredibly fun, but to today's standards, it is pretty barren and empty mechanically. There is no cover system, but you can crouch behind things. Weapons shoot in a very curved way if you leave Widescreen turned on. It looks pretty bad on a 16:9 monitor when using widescreen off. The driving is very arcade-y and turning is very rapid and overall works nicely. The city of Miami (Vice City), however, is the main highlight. This is not only one of the most memorable video game maps of all time, it is also... a beautifully remarkable city of pure nostalgia. While it is minuscule in size by comparison to other GTA maps, it sticks with you forever, especially if you played this game for hundreds of hours as a kid. The game makes me feel like I am back at home, which is an extraordinary feeling. While it certainly is a bit short, (took me 10 hours to beat - a bit of a rushed playstyle, and used weapon cheats only). Storywise, it will remind you of classics such as Scarface. This is definitely a recommendation, but I also recommend modding it to bring it a bit more to today's standards.10/10 for the time.			"

												Grand Theft Auto Vice City (GTA:VC) is a throwback to the 80s pop culture and takes a number of cues from movies that were big in that awesome decade.This game takes place in Vice City which is, basically, Miami. However, it's Miami of the 80s. There is a certain Miami Vice vibe to the game as well as Scarface and other such movies that were popular at that time.You play as hitman Sonny Vercetti who has recently been released from prison. He goes down to Vice City, at the behest of the mob boss he works for, to get in on the Miami action. Like the Miami of the 80s drugs and drug running/smuggling plays a big part of the story. It's a sandbox game but it's also an empire building game.Vice City is beautiful and fun to explore. You'll find hidden easter eggs, if you look hard enough, like the shower scene from Scarface.Another great thing about this game is the music. Rockstar licensed real music from the 80s and it goes together with the gameplay experience well. Sometimes it's satisfying to cruise around Vice City while listening to 80s music. In a way it really takes you back.If you are a fan or child of the 80s and enjoyed Grand Theft Auto III you would do well to pick this up. If only they would remake this using higher poly models and higher screen resolutions.			"

												Arguably the best GTA made yet, VC improved on its predecessor, GTA3, by adding motorbikes, aircraft, and real music. The last point compliments the 1986 setting perfectly, evoking nostalgia in the best possible way and reminding us of classic 80s movies and TV series. The mission design and sense of humour set a benchmark which more recent iterations of the series have yet to improve on.			"

												GTA in its purest form. It was the first GTA game I ever played and probably the best. Vice City has everything - a managable map; memorable characters; a killer OST; great sense of humour and inch-perfect controls. It's much cheaper now than back in the day so there's no excuse to not pick it up. Listen out for the celeb cameos (Debbie Harry and Jenna Jameson to name but two)!			"

If you haven't tried it before or are afraid it's feeling old, this game is a timeless classic, perfect for Fall.			"

												GTA: Vice City is an amazing game, It's a classic from my childhood memory when my brother finally bought a PS2 and I watched him play for hours/days before he would even let me play but when he did I was hooked. To this day I still play the GTA series and own every game. Driving through Vice City with the old music playing really made you feel like you were cruising around Miami back in the 80's and especially if you pay attention to the storyline. I highly recommend if anyone like playing the new GTA's they should definately purchase the old ones!			"

Features that it has that Grand Theft Auto III doesn't have: the ability to change your clothes, the ability to buy safehouses, the ability to fly helicopters and planes, and the ability to switch out weapons but carrying only one weapon of each type. Lots of things to do to get 100% completetion. Took me awhile to get both the Criminal rating and 100% done. 9.5/10 Still some frustrating gameplay mechanics it has that Grand Theft Auto III has as well.			"

I think the era the game is set in is the biggest difference between these two. You'll usually find that older gamers prefer VC, and the youngers prefer SA. I dont think there's a need to look into the story, the gameplay, or anything. We all know GTA. If you had missed this game for some reason, then go ahead and buy it.

Nós controlamos o mafioso Tommy Vercetti na cidade de Vice City, podendo atravessar o mapa com carros, motos, helicópteros, etc. Tudo começa com uma negociação em 1986 com o ex-chefe de Tommy, Sonny Forelli, essa negociação era sobre drogas, mas acabou sendo uma armadilha para Tommy. Tommy consegue fugir, e assim começa a história do jogo, conhecemos mais personagens ao longo da história para ajudar Tommy a recuperar o dinheiro envolvido na negociação que deu errado. Recomendo muito o jogo!			"

												Although this game is categorized as ""classic"" it still has appropriate 3D graphics and outstanding gameplay. And after all, every proud gamer nows what does the GTA means - one man, lots of mayhem and more lots of fun. Nevertheless, apart from brainless shootout this game offers really intriguing story line with really special non-playable characters :) Worth to buy, play and complete :)			"

												This is well worth playing from start to finish. Even after you finish the story, just messing around performing impossible jumps or running from the cops and national guard is worth the price of admission. Shooting backwards with the tank while moving forward for some extra nitro: priceless.			"

												You play as Tommy Vercetti.A guy who did 15 years behind bars because of a story that happend in Vietnam.Now he's off into Vice City to make a drug deal.But as it goes they get ambushed,friends got killed and you need to find the drugs and cash back for your boss Sonny Forelli.Games awesome.Lots of things to do,immersive storyline and lots of side mission,dark humour,lots of easter eggs and hints and much more.Buy it it's worth it in my opinion.

												Amazing game. Completed in 12 hours (all missions) but only 44%.This percentage leads me to believe the game is amazingly dense with lots of things to do, etc.The soundtrack is by far the best on the series and one of the best on the industry. It got really hard for me to leave the cars, consideing I would not hear music.However, there's an issue. Two actually :- The Crosshair, on widescreens or resolutions that are 16:9, is inaccurate. The center dot is above the line of fire, so aim a bit up for headshots;- The mouse sensitivity is enourmous and inaccurate as well. In fact, the Y axis isn't the same as the X axis. You may have to lower the sens. on windows or download a file to fix the issue. Rockstar should really look into it.Apart from that, amazing game, awesome soundtrack and lots of fun.			"

												Vice City is the next installment of the GTA franchise after 3. Taking place in Vice City, one of the cities based off Hawaii, you play as Tommy Vercetti, a made-man on the Forelli family. After being setup by your don, Sonny Forelli to be killed, you survive the vicious encounter and police forces arrest you on 10 counts of murder and are imprisoned for 15 years effectively being named as the ""Harwood Butcher"". After Sunny, one of your next of kin gets you out of jail, you try to hit up a deal with Vic Vance to pay off old debts by taking a flight from Liberty City to Vice City...however not everything comes to plan. Vic Vance is assassinated, the money is stolen, leaving Sonny in doubt of the loyalty of Tommy who has to take over Vice City to pay the debt off.Vice City introduced many features such as property ownage (able to buy properties in different islands), manage assets for profit, added and tweaked side-missions, full voice acting cast (Tommy himself is voice acted) and brilliant open-world experience. Classic and recommended. Install SilentPatch and his Y-AXIS fix to play the game like it was intended.			"

												Well, i've got to be honest. It's a horrible port. I'm running on windows 8 and there are a lot of problems. When I first hopped into the game I wanted to change the mouse sensitivity because it was too high. So I got it to a respectable level, but here's the thing. I got it to a respectable level across the X axis. Forget about aiming up and down. You so much as breath on the back of your mouse and your aiming goes into hyperspeed. I also wanted to run the game at 60+fps so there is a helpful option which I turned off called frame limiter. Yeap, I was getting great fps but there is a catch. The cars go to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Seriously, they just decide to not work properly at all, (You can't even reverse). I also ran across another horrible thing about 1 hour into the game. I was doing a mission where you fly a sort of drone thing, so I was expecting the usual sort of wasd and an ascend/descend button. Nope, instead you get this god awful button layout for controlling it, something along the lines of 9 to go forward, q to rotate clockwise and then some other numpad buttons to control it mixed in with wasd. I don't even know how I managed to get through that mission XDAnways, if you can get past the bad port, and the buggyness, underneath all that is a truely beautiful game. This really is so fun to play. Don't feel put off by reading my review. This still is a great game and definitly deserves to be played and enjoyed.			"

												Vice City may not have the fancy graphics nor as much interactivity as it's later siblings, but to me the storyline, graphic style, music and setting of Vice City, all combine perfectly to produce a sublime whole that has yet to be beaten. It's the only game other than Minecraft where I have found myself on a beach, watching the sunset and enjoying every second of it. So if you are late to the series and passed this one by cos 'it's old', do yourself a favour and give it a try - you won't regret it.			"

												I love it, I can't stop playing, my keyboard is getting mashed up, my spaceba and WASD keys are getting smothend out because of all the tapping i'm doing playing. My freaking keyboard got noticably eroded within weeks of buying the game. Crazy fun, not to many planes, but some helicopters, funny as ♥♥♥♥ radio stations. I suggest listening to VCPR, it's crazy. Or KCHAT. Some times i've driven around SPECIFICLY to listen to the radio stations, there's some pretty good music on them too. I love the non-stop action, humor and just satasfaction in this GTA game, taking a perfectly fine city and puting a single virus in it capable of causing mass destruction,and that virus is you. The character's looks can be a little weird at times. But it's not like that really matters. There's crazy stunts to do all across the map, tons of cars, even a tank at one mission. It's a great game, fun as hell to watch, and play. And the story is nice too, how you grow up working for the big guys in town, eventually you become the big guy. Perfect, 9/10. ONLY because of the lack of aircraft, if there was a plane or two i'd probably give it a 10/10.			"

												The first thing you'll notice is the same mistakes as GTA3, you'd expect them to fix this by now. The opening videos does not play properly and has to be manually renamed, this could be an issue with Windows 7 only of course. The mouse sensitivity only changes in one axis for some reason, which is stupid. The FPS problems remains. There's not much change in the gameplay from GTA3, there's mostly just new stuff added, a completely new place to roam around in but the same concept remains. I didn't enjoy the story or protagonist as much either, it's just not that memorable, however I thought they improved the gameplay with a lot of small things. Joystick support is still very poor.imdbScore: 7.0/10			"

												This is easily my favorite GTA game in the franchise. The story is alright but really, who plays GTA for the story? This game is jam packed with unique and thrilling missions that keep you playing. Vehicles aren't really a huge part of the game but nonetheless there is quite the variety to choose from. To top it all off this game is jam packed with hilarious and interesting easter eggs. Literally. But it is not a perfect game by no means. The control is a little wonky at times and the driving is not the best. At the end of the game (no spoilers) you need to collect money for the final mission and the way you get money takes WAY too long if you do not do the process of getting these money making means before hand. But other than a few minor complaints, I CANNOT suggest this game any more. If you like games that can suck you in for hours and hours without you knowing then buy this game immediately!			"

												GTA games all seem to be good. Some are better than others, this is one of those, infact the best of the GTA's I have bought this game so many times due to loss, different platforms, etc. I do not regret buying it any of the times. My brother introduced me to this game,  at first i would just watch him play for hours (yes, even that was fun) and when I was allowed to play I didn't stop for quite a while, I rember recommendin L4D2 and saying that it was 'the best FPS game ever!'  I was wrong as I clearly didn't think of this game, this is not just the best FPS game ever, it is the BEST GAME ever.For just £5.99, 7.25 EUR or $9.29 This is a bargain for that price, (prices may be different from time of recommedation) normally you get rubbishy little games for £6, Vice City is so under-rated because it is dated, but it was only 2 years before San-Andreas (Another good one by the way) yet everyone seems to dismiss VC.I really can't say enough to explain how amazingly outstanding...

												This is one of the best games of history of video games. It´s Fun, great characters, decent gameplay and 80s atmosphere makes it one of the best games out there. Graphics are bit out dated, and lots of people are graphics freaks today, so i will not probaly wont reccomend them this game. It´s a big improvment over the GTA3 and i would reccomend it to people who likes intense story, great gameplay, amazing setting and music so great that you dont want to leave your car.			"

												Following on from GTA 3, this game continues to impress with an inovative story that holds true to the reality of the whole, 80's Miami vice, drug fueled era. The gameplay is awesome, the graphics for the time were amazing, it adds the ability to buy properties and profit from them, the environment is beautiful, the voice acting rules. Again, if you have not already played this (suprisingly) play it!			"

												My personal favorite GTA game. Created with a lot of similarities to scarface. Unfortunately does not work well with framerate unlocked, but it is still worth buying even today. It is very satisfying starting from a nobody goon who just served 15 years in jail, to owning all of Vice City's hotspots and businesses and becoming your own boss.			"

												First GTA game I ever played, and It will be and always will be my #1 Favorite all time game. The amount of detail, and the entire story line kept me playing for hours and hours never getting bored on Ps2. Since I loved it so much, I have bought the game for Android, Apple, Playstation 2, and PC. I really hope to see someday in the future a Vice City 2. I know there is Vice City Stories, but for some reason, I just couldn't compare it to the original. Tommy Vercetti is perhaps the best GTA character, besides Trevor in GTA V in the Grand Theft Auto series.			"

												For recent laptops, this game can comprehend it, even at an Intel Graphics 3000. Fun game, wish that the game didn't have so many minor problems, but that doesn't mean the game should be bad. I have to say its the only Grand Theft Auto that was depicting the 1980's and this game that was created at its time was the best most people can come up with, and it has a fun story-line too. I wish that I know how to adjust the video resolution if there is any so that its not a square haha.. Ill figure it out eventually. Lovely game.			"

												Is it better than San Andreas? In style alone, I would have to say yes. Vice City is still unparraled with it's 80s feel, it's great story, and it's use of making a city feel alive. If you haven't tried it before or are afraid it's feeling old, this game is a timeless classic, perfect for Fall.			"

												This game is about a man named Tony Montana who wants to become the Godfather, so he asks for a little friend at the don's wedding and shoots up the place. It takes place in Miami Vice with police officers and there are lots of shenanagins that take place. I had some troubles keeping up with them, but I find that it was easy when I took my pills (grandpa is getting old you know). This reminds me of my first son and third daughter, boy were they good kids. Why did they grow to resent me? At least your mother doesn't hate me, right Billy?Grandpa gives this game a 10/10 because it has bright colors and flashy billboards and little friends.			"

												The first thing you'll notice is the same mistakes as GTA3, you'd expect them to fix this by now. The opening videos does not play properly and has to be manually renamed, this could be an issue with Windows 7 only of course. The mouse sensitivity only changes in one axis for some reason, which is stupid. The FPS problems remains. There's not much change in the gameplay from GTA3, there's mostly just new stuff added, a completely new place to roam around in but the same concept remains. I didn't enjoy the story or protagonist as much either, it's just not that memorable, however I thought they improved the gameplay with a lot of small things. Joystick support is still very poor.imdbScore: 7.0/10			"

												First of all this game is really good but has a few problems but also improved on a few mistakes gta 3 made.The first time i played this was an illegal version a friend gave me but the game crashed on the riot mission so it wasnt much good to me. I decided to buy the GTA 3 trilogy bundle and i wasnt dissapointed by any of these 3 games. GTA 3 was the first i played and GTA SA the first i owned and my favourite GTA and maybe my favourite game ever but this game ws different to both of those in a few ways and similar in a few ways too and the same as gta 3 in many ways, let me explain why.The Game is on the same engine as GTA 3 and the graphics, sounds, hud and a bunch of other things like the fact that you cant swim are all identical to GTA 3 but the hud is a different colour, but all this makes me realise how different GTA SA was to these 2 games, i havn't completed this game and have only got 3.3 hours at the time of this review but i enjoy it although the mission ""demolition man"" i one of the most frustrating missions in gta and made number 2 on the WatchMojo - ""top 10 hardest GTA missions"" video which you should all watch (shout out to them) but otherwise the game is amazing, now let me tell you the things it improved on and the things it did badPros - Protagonist is now fully voiced unlike gta 3, more weapons, good weather effects, good cars and other vehicles, bikes and helicopters were added and drivable and so were boats but im not sure if they were in gta 3 or not (you could drive one in a mission though), good story, good characters.Cons - Didnt like the music (my opinion), some boring and or hard missions were in there, small map, same engine/graphics/sounds as gta 3, cant swim, cops are hard to lose sometimes which applies for gta 3 aswell, poorly explained mission objectives (for some missions anyway), bad combat system but still better than gta 3 but only by a bit, cars feel really slow sometimes and really fast other times.Otherwise great game and gets 8 out of 10.

												If you've played shooters for a while you obviously have heard of GTA Series but, Vice City is very unique. This and Vice City Stories are the only games in the GTA Series to be based in Miami, Florida. It is based in the 1980s with your main characters name is Tommy. Tommy is a white male that is trying to give his friend Sonny his drug money back from a fail of a deal. Graphics are outdated but, I dont mind it's still a fun action packed game. If you are a fan of GTA and like the older games in the series such as GTA : Sandreas I fully recommend to play through Vice City.			"

												Fun and enjoyable, has an amazing soundtrack and a pretty good story. tommy (the main protaganist) isnt all that likable (well to me he isnt) but it doesnt really take away from the overall experience with the game. although i have had some problems with the frame rate and some controls not working when you turn off the frame limiter. if you can deal with those small problems then it is definetely worth a buy in my opinion. if you have are used to a smooth 60 fps on all your games and you dont think you could handle your frames being limitied to 30 fps, and a fair bit of stuttering every now and then. i dont reccomend that you get this game. but if there was one piont of vice city that i would like to push on you, it is the soundtrack. it is great and there is a radio station for pretty much everyone. but if you are after that 1980s miami vibe i would suggest Emotion.so once again, if you arent too bothered with not having a flawless and mooth experience, get this game. but if you are one of the few that could not handle even looking at a game unless it is running at a buttery 60 fps. i suggest you to give this game a shot, it really is great. and if you dont like it its not much money wasted. its GTA vice city after all			"

												""Go Get Some Sleep."" And that's the way your game starts. One of the best I ever played. Starting on Vice City, Tommy Vercetti will show you how damn good is living there. The whole history of the game will make you stay on your PC and will make you play this more and more. The Soundtrack? The best of the bests, you wanna stay in your car when the songs play. I'll recommend this for all of my life.PS: If you think Usain Bolt is the fastest human, in Vice City that old woman is the fastest when you shoot! hahahaPS2: Tati, você vai adorar a Trilha Sonora desse jogo! ;)			"

												Quite possibly the best GTA game that will ever be made. The time period and setting of the game is just perfect. It also contains the best soundtrack of all the time. I hope that Rockstar either remake this game, or make a new game with the same time period and setting. I unfortunately doubt it because kids nowadays love the modern vehicles, modern weaponry, and modern music. No one can make games like this one anymore, just look at GTA V...			"

												In my humble opinion, still the best GTA title to date (I haven't played GTAV yet, so that might change). Yeah, sure, you can do more stuff in other GTA games, but this one has that impossible ""duende"", that.,. vibe. The vibe is perfect, the story (although a ripoff from Scarface) is great and the CHARACTERS, oh my, the CHARACTERS. Go take your Trevors and Michaels and CJs and Claudes and take them to school - *this* is how you make characters. All of them are nuts and over the top, as they should be for a GTA game, but they have that... that... something that just makes them so memorable, from the snow-abusing Rosenberg to the charismatic Colonel Cortez, Tommy himself of course just oozes bada$$ery in every way possible.The graphics are old and fugly for today's standards, but I don't care. My real problem is the lack of widescreen support, but there is a very good and reliable widescreen fix available on the interwebz somewhere, so that takes care of that. Uzi. Cheetah. Sunshine. VRock. Delve in and cry when it's over.			"

												Amazing game. Completed in 12 hours (all missions) but only 44%.This percentage leads me to believe the game is amazingly dense with lots of things to do, etc.The soundtrack is by far the best on the series and one of the best on the industry. It got really hard for me to leave the cars, consideing I would not hear music.However, there's an issue. Two actually :- The Crosshair, on widescreens or resolutions that are 16:9, is inaccurate. The center dot is above the line of fire, so aim a bit up for headshots;- The mouse sensitivity is enourmous and inaccurate as well. In fact, the Y axis isn't the same as the X axis. You may have to lower the sens. on windows or download a file to fix the issue. Rockstar should really look into it.Apart from that, amazing game, awesome soundtrack and lots of fun.			"

I do too.Here are cons of the game:1) Graphics are terrible considering now that GTA 5 is out.2) Some of the missions, especially Demolition man or controlling small RC devices are terrible. These fxxxing drives me crazy.3) Cars blow up too easy. It is not at all realistic.4) Often time, it throws handling error at random without clear reason.5) Mods, save files or trainers that used to work for retail version will not work on steam versions.6) This game is not really made for windows platform beyond Win 7.

												If you've played shooters for a while you obviously have heard of GTA Series but, Vice City is very unique. This and Vice City Stories are the only games in the GTA Series to be based in Miami, Florida. It is based in the 1980s with your main characters name is Tommy. Tommy is a white male that is trying to give his friend Sonny his drug money back from a fail of a deal. Graphics are outdated but, I dont mind it's still a fun action packed game. If you are a fan of GTA and like the older games in the series such as GTA : Sandreas I fully recommend to play through Vice City.			"

												Step 1: Find game with better soundtrackStep 2: Come to terms with your failure Additional Information: There is one thing I know for sure: each of us will fail, at something, at some point. The question is: what will we do about it?All successful people I know attribute part of their success to failure. Though it’s usually painful, we learn from failure. I know that my own failures, and there have been many, have planted the seeds for future success and constant humility I carry with me like a small talisman.Failure forces you to become resilient. We’ve all heard of denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance; they are the steps one follows to get through grief. I came to realize that one could have a plan of action for coming to terms with failure — a roadmap to help find your way out of despair and build resilience to make you stronger for certain other failures that await.I began as an investment manager in the late 1980’s fresh out of Wharton. Having had consistent success since then, it is hard to believe that the heady days of early 1998 would set the stage for a stunning and swift near collapse of my firm and career.Things couldn’t have been going better. My firm was coming off a hot streak of several years. We were growing and making good money for our clients, and therefore good money for ourselves. We had just negotiated the sale of half our business for an enormous sum, meaning I would have officially “made it” at 33 years old. That is until the summer of 1998.A tornado hit the financial markets as Russia defaulted on their debt and the collapse of Long Term Capital Management seemed to bring Wall Street to its knees. (A crisis, when compared to the crisis of 2008, could best be described as adorable.)Our funds quickly headed south and we weren’t well positioned to save them. We made many mistakes; some due to hubris, some due to poor judgment, some due to poor efforts keeping investors informed.When the deal to sell half the firm was terminated by the buyer in the fall of 1998, our business was in shambles. Adding salt to the wound, the market rallied strongly in the end of ’98, making our relatively poor performance that much worse. My failure thoroughly in place, and my ego and self-esteem in tatters, I waited for the dust to settle. The stage was set. I could either be resilient or decide to be washed up at 33.Opting to be courageous, I devised a step-by-step plan to find my way back after a really big moment of underachieving. I’ve found that deliberate planning helps me get to a place where I can have the objectivity to learn from a debacle.And really, if you can’t learn anything from failing, what good is it anyway?Here are my steps:1.    Allow yourself a very short, defined moment of wallowing in the failure. Maybe you give in and permit yourself one weekend of binge TV watching, laying on the couch and eating crap. Do not, however, let this step drag on.2.    Get back in the game, even if you have to play hurt.  Fake that you’re ok. It’s completely acceptable to know you are faking your resilience at this point.  You can’t expect immediate results, but you can act confidently knowing one-day things will be ok.3.    Recalibrate what’s important. Here’s a moment to reassess what your priorities are and revise how you’ve been spending your time, if necessary. If you’ve lost a really important promotion, a long sought after election, or an end to a relationship, you’re going to feel pain for a really long time. The bigger and more unique the failure, the harder it will be to imagine that you could ever feel better. Very often a big failure leaves you with more time on your hands than you thought you would have. Finding solace in a new interest or self-improvement you’ve always meant to try should be high on your priority list.4.    Re-visit. This is an important step that is both immediate and serves the long term.  On the heels of your great catastrophe, write yourself a letter and be sure to include everything you’re thinking; every pain, every embarrassment, every feeling of loss or shame. Put the letter away. Take it out six months later and evaluate how much these intense feelings of hurt have subsided. Time heals wounds, fades lines in the sand, and opens never-before considered perspectives.5.    Change up your routine to help you find a new normal. However, keep some semblance of order. Make your bed everyday…literally.These steps have helped me more than once. I’m lending them to you because fortunately for the moment I’m not using them (though I’m sure I will again).The goal, forever and always, is to be in a position to learn from failure, for that is its gift. It will lead you to future successes and ultimately help shed the fear that failure often brings. "

												Better than GTA III, but not as good as SA. Vice City is my 3rd favorite GTA game everr.- Customizable player- Good storyline- Lots of missionsIt COULD use some more outfits (like maybe masks) and a big finale mission such as a bank robbery (like the one in GTA IV), but still 8/10.			"

												The best GTA game in my view: GTA3 brought a new style to the games, GTA:VC perfected it and then GTA:SA took it too far and turned you into a Sim.Gotta love being able to race around a city on a motorbike, casusing havoc while listening to the great soundtrack, without all the 'responsibilities' you get with the more recent GTAs			"

												I owned this game on disk about ten years ago. The game worked fine then but on steam the mouse and keyboard controls don't work correctly making this game a complete chore to play. I can't recommend this game on steam until this issue is patched.   For now if your mouse is not working you need to   ""shift-tab"" to the steam window and then back to the game in order to use your mouse.... every time you use the menu system in game.			"

												Well, here you are - wondering if this game is worth picking up, and lives up to the hype. I was wondering the same a couple days ago. From the short amount I have played so far I can tell this is going to be my favorite Grand Theft Auto game (I have played gta 3, San Andreas, and beaten gta IV, and V). If you are going to pick this up, which you should, I would read all the articles in the gameplay support section, and apply the mods\ patches needed to make the game most enjoyable for you. I would also reccomend using classic controls, and a gamepad, although the pc controls work fine (A little hard to aim with the mouse sometimes on standard controls mode). "

												The game rules but the Y axis of the mouse is super out of wack and non adjustable. making the game a headache to play. BUT you can download a mod out there that fixes this and numerous other problems. You will have to down grade the game to its original version to run these mods, but it is all relatively easy. Just be prepared to do some work before you can really play this game. All the old PC GTA's have issues Rockstar never fixed (because Rockstar NEVER fixes any of their games) and apperantly really does not know how to make a game for computers, only consoles.			"

												My favorite GTA title is unplayable because of poor button controls, even with an official Xbox gamepad. Pros: Great plot feels like it would be right at home as a sopranos spin-off, The music is awesome. The missions are diverse enough to keep you amused. The controller support is god awful, which makes no sense, because GTAIII works fine, so doe's san andreas, IV and liberty city stories, so why make the controls on this one not only different, but impossible to function? 5/10 faggios			"

												If your looking for a review on GTA Vice City you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												There's nothing like mowing down gang members on the Vice City Strip in Little Haiti and Little Havana in a monster truck while Slayer is playing in the background. Was fun way back in 2003 on the PS2, and is still fun today. The only real downside is that it can be a bit tricky to get to work on some modern computers, however, in my opinion, it's totally worth it. And as an aside, whatever you do, if you decide to fly a helicopter for any reason, use a damn controller. It'll save you all the headache.			"

												To my mind the best of the GTA series, although it came before the better control system of GTA:San Andreas. It mimics the 80s well and parodies Miami Vice at every turn. Good fun, distracting and very much a game to sample now and again. "

												To me, Vice City is the best Grand Theft Auto game, period! I have played every GTA since the first one (which is a blast by the way) and was dissapointed by the stereotypical tone and gameplay of San Andreas. Vice City on the other hand is very clever in it's writing, the sandbox element is great, the soundtrack is one of the best in video game history (look it up if you don't believe me) and the ""sexual content"" is not tastless and vulgar as the last two games. Vice City had that cool 1980s feel and I loved it.			"

												Following on from GTA 3, this game continues to impress with an inovative story that holds true to the reality of the whole, 80's Miami vice, drug fueled era. The gameplay is awesome, the graphics for the time were amazing, it adds the ability to buy properties and profit from them, the environment is beautiful, the voice acting rules. Again, if you have not already played this (suprisingly) play it!			"

I can't recommend this game on steam until this issue is patched.   For now if your mouse is not working you need to   ""shift-tab"" to the steam window and then back to the game in order to use your mouse.... every time you use the menu system in game.			"

												This game is about a man named Tony Montana who wants to become the Godfather, so he asks for a little friend at the don's wedding and shoots up the place. It takes place in Miami Vice with police officers and there are lots of shenanagins that take place. I had some troubles keeping up with them, but I find that it was easy when I took my pills (grandpa is getting old you know). This reminds me of my first son and third daughter, boy were they good kids. Why did they grow to resent me?

												Good game, always loved GTA Vice City. Was the start of the GTA Franchise for me.Funny to think back in the day the graphics were amazing.Controls were a little bit off though. Had difficulty playing initally because my mouse would not work, but switched to windows 98 mode and that fixed that issue. Game play also feels a little bit faster than I remember, but that might only be because it has been so long. My theory was because of the better computer specs it runs a little faster than on the PS2. Found fast cars almost too fast to drive and would take the slower ones. Plus in a shoot out amour and health would go down so fast. Still a great game even with the minor issues, good to play when bored.4/5 for me!			"

												Step 1: Find game with better soundtrackStep 2: Come to terms with your failure Additional Information: There is one thing I know for sure: each of us will fail, at something, at some point. The question is: what will we do about it?All successful people I know attribute part of their success to failure. Though it’s usually painful, we learn from failure. I know that my own failures, and there have been many, have planted the seeds for future success and constant humility I carry with me like a small talisman.Failure forces you to become resilient. We’ve all heard of denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance; they are the steps one follows to get through grief. I came to realize that one could have a plan of action for coming to terms with failure — a roadmap to help find your way out of despair and build resilience to make you stronger for certain other failures that await.I began as an investment manager in the late 1980’s fresh out of Wharton. Having had consistent success since then, it is hard to believe that the heady days of early 1998 would set the stage for a stunning and swift near collapse of my firm and career.Things couldn’t have been going better. My firm was coming off a hot streak of several years. We were growing and making good money for our clients, and therefore good money for ourselves. We had just negotiated the sale of half our business for an enormous sum, meaning I would have officially “made it” at 33 years old. That is until the summer of 1998.A tornado hit the financial markets as Russia defaulted on their debt and the collapse of Long Term Capital Management seemed to bring Wall Street to its knees. (A crisis, when compared to the crisis of 2008, could best be described as adorable.)Our funds quickly headed south and we weren’t well positioned to save them. We made many mistakes; some due to hubris, some due to poor judgment, some due to poor efforts keeping investors informed.When the deal to sell half the firm was terminated by the buyer in the fall of 1998, our business was in shambles. Adding salt to the wound, the market rallied strongly in the end of ’98, making our relatively poor performance that much worse. My failure thoroughly in place, and my ego and self-esteem in tatters, I waited for the dust to settle. The stage was set. I could either be resilient or decide to be washed up at 33.Opting to be courageous, I devised a step-by-step plan to find my way back after a really big moment of underachieving. I’ve found that deliberate planning helps me get to a place where I can have the objectivity to learn from a debacle.And really, if you can’t learn anything from failing, what good is it anyway?Here are my steps:1.    Allow yourself a very short, defined moment of wallowing in the failure. Maybe you give in and permit yourself one weekend of binge TV watching, laying on the couch and eating crap. Do not, however, let this step drag on.2.    Get back in the game, even if you have to play hurt.  Fake that you’re ok. It’s completely acceptable to know you are faking your resilience at this point.  You can’t expect immediate results, but you can act confidently knowing one-day things will be ok.3.    Recalibrate what’s important. Here’s a moment to reassess what your priorities are and revise how you’ve been spending your time, if necessary. If you’ve lost a really important promotion, a long sought after election, or an end to a relationship, you’re going to feel pain for a really long time. The bigger and more unique the failure, the harder it will be to imagine that you could ever feel better. Very often a big failure leaves you with more time on your hands than you thought you would have. Finding solace in a new interest or self-improvement you’ve always meant to try should be high on your priority list.4.    Re-visit. This is an important step that is both immediate and serves the long term.  On the heels of your great catastrophe, write yourself a letter and be sure to include everything you’re thinking; every pain, every embarrassment, every feeling of loss or shame. Put the letter away. Take it out six months later and evaluate how much these intense feelings of hurt have subsided. Time heals wounds, fades lines in the sand, and opens never-before considered perspectives.5.    Change up your routine to help you find a new normal. However, keep some semblance of order. Make your bed everyday…literally.These steps have helped me more than once. I’m lending them to you because fortunately for the moment I’m not using them (though I’m sure I will again).The goal, forever and always, is to be in a position to learn from failure, for that is its gift. It will lead you to future successes and ultimately help shed the fear that failure often brings. "

Don't let anyone fool you into thinking that San Andreas is better (many people would ague about which game is better but that isn't relevant). If you are a fan of GTA you need to buy this game.  It may not be the prettiest thing in the world but I had more fun playing this game than I did playing GTA 5.			"

												GTA: Vice City is set in the most magical time period of the whole Grand Theft Auto series. It has a certain charm that the other games certainly haven't accomplished to the same degree. The soundtrack is one of the most beautiful, and breathtaking soundtracks in all of gaming. The radio commentators are hilarious and witty, and they accompany the music wonderfully. Fernando Martinez from Emotion 98.3 is a prime example of this, constantly commenting about the way he flirts with women, and other things. The gameplay of this game has always been incredibly fun, but to today's standards, it is pretty barren and empty mechanically. There is no cover system, but you can crouch behind things. Weapons shoot in a very curved way if you leave Widescreen turned on. It looks pretty bad on a 16:9 monitor when using widescreen off. The driving is very arcade-y and turning is very rapid and overall works nicely. The city of Miami (Vice City), however, is the main highlight. This is not only one of the most memorable video game maps of all time, it is also... a beautifully remarkable city of pure nostalgia. While it is minuscule in size by comparison to other GTA maps, it sticks with you forever, especially if you played this game for hundreds of hours as a kid. The game makes me feel like I am back at home, which is an extraordinary feeling. While it certainly is a bit short, (took me 10 hours to beat - a bit of a rushed playstyle, and used weapon cheats only). Storywise, it will remind you of classics such as Scarface. This is definitely a recommendation, but I also recommend modding it to bring it a bit more to today's standards.10/10 for the time.			"

												Grand Theft Auto Vice City has a few ups and downs.The good news is all the ups are in the area of Gameplay which is still amazing and even stands up next to newer games such as GTV V. This game is more simple and arcadey than it's newer siblings which means even though it's not as realistic as the new GTA games it still turns out to be amazing fun in a wonderfully hyper-realised Maimi-ish island.The bad news is that the story mode is very offensive, the radio is sexist, homophobic and just pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥ I know this game is known for being offensive and it's also pretty old now so saying this is offensive is just well, dull. But it's true, a few missions are VERY transphobic and as a trans girl this was pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥My advice, skip the cutscenes and enjoy the game with custom music. It's a blast then.			"

												I definitely recommend this game, and not only recommend it on all systems, but more specifically on the PC. Reason; I own this game on all sorts of consoles. PC, Xbox, PS2, even iOS and even Android. (I never beaten the iOS and Android ones...) Reason I say the PC one's the best; GAMEPLAY. SO MUCH EASIER. It's because of the manual aim. There is no auto-aim (for those who really want it in this game) but because you have a mouse instead, trust me, it is SO MUCH BETTER. I remember the last level, (specially on the Xbox one, that was my first one) and it was extremely difficult to maneuver with the auto-aim. but with manual, you can just run and shoot, no standing and aiming!!5 outta 5!!

												Grand Theft Auto: Vice City- действительно удивительная игра. Сюжет в ней не настолько уж интересен, но запомнилась она всем геймерам совсем другим. Миссии совсем не надоедают, а некоторые заставят вас запомнить их навсегда (к примеру, миссия с вертолётиком или ограбление банка), а персонажи- своей харизматичностью. Но что действительно ценишь в игре, так это музыку. Она дополняет ту волшебную атмосферу 80-ых годов... Нет, GTA: Vice city очень сложно описать словами. Да, у неё есть минусы, но в эту игру надо обязательно пройти!			"

												So far, this has been the best grand theft auto.Definitely opened my ears to music that was before my generation. And art. And style. And solid helicopter controls.In the games that improved upon the techological shortcomings of Vice City, they lost other thigns that were much more important. For example: in gta4 they had... no, nevermind bad example. For example: in San Andreas, they had a much more dynamic map with more terrain than vice city had.  In SA, they made a much bigger map and reincluded things like mountains and actual hills. Great additions. They also added things like girlfriend minigames, gang territory, better modeled car suspension, and more interaction with properties, oh and swimming which was a turning point in the series.But what the series slowly lost was that FUN sparkle, the tooty fruity stereotype magic that is felt in things like disney or other cartoons. The gang overarching was cool and all in SanAndreas, but after a while in the game, it brought a seriousness that I did not welcome in Grand Theft Auto. And with the release of GTA4, I think we all should have known something was up. That game lacked all which is enjoyable. It was like windows vista.I've gotten far off topic. What I'm saying is, if you can think about a comparrison to a later (or earlier, actually, huh...) GTA, most likely, the change was either bad overall or pointless.Like most great things, unless you break them down into tiny itsy bitsy little mechanics and details, the only way to describe the greatness of it is to equate it to some unquantifiable magic. In this case, however, I just feel like the over-the-top satire Miami Vice was the PERFECT setting, and I'd like to see GTA6 in the same vein, since with GTA5 it seems like they had a last minute realization, and are slowly working their way back from GTA4.theres a long way to get there, but Rockstar (the developer) is thankfully moving in the right direction. value (for a newcomer with a patience for low poly graphics): 50$Current value (if I needed to play it again and didnt own it): 15$which is saying a lot since I dont often give praise to games. FYI - I played this on ps2, might not be the same experience on pc.			"

												One of the best and most unique Grand Theft Auto games. The fact that this one was released a year after GTA III really shows the strength of Rockstar North. No point in explaining the formula, I'm sure most of you know what an open-world game feels like thanks to GTA III's impact. Vice City, however, sticks out to me because of the second half of the game, in which you are allowed to buy any properties that give you missions, expanding on the non-linear nature of the series. If any of this doesn't interest you, then let me tell you that the soundtrack kicks♥♥♥♥♥ boy. The radio stations expanded to a huge size since GTA III, with many diverse stations and commercials that parody the 80s this side of Robocop.

												This game is as amazing as i remember, the soundtrack does not dissapoint amongst the humerous radio stations, mayhem and destruction that GTA is well known for. This game should take between 8 - 12 hours doing just the storyline quests, not to mention if you wish to take part in the many other parts that this game has to offer including purchasing property, car collections, races, rampages etc.I deffinately reccomend this game if you are a fan of new or old GTA or just enjoy sandbox games, but keep in mind that this will not be as expansive as the newer GTA games or san andreas.It is well worth having this game in your library.

												If your looking for a review on GTA Vice City you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												The first thing you'll notice is the same mistakes as GTA3, you'd expect them to fix this by now. The opening videos does not play properly and has to be manually renamed, this could be an issue with Windows 7 only of course. The mouse sensitivity only changes in one axis for some reason, which is stupid. The FPS problems remains. There's not much change in the gameplay from GTA3, there's mostly just new stuff added, a completely new place to roam around in but the same concept remains. I didn't enjoy the story or protagonist as much either, it's just not that memorable, however I thought they improved the gameplay with a lot of small things. Joystick support is still very poor.imdbScore: 7.0/10			"

I have played every GTA since the first one (which is a blast by the way) and was dissapointed by the stereotypical tone and gameplay of San Andreas. Vice City on the other hand is very clever in it's writing, the sandbox element is great, the soundtrack is one of the best in video game history (look it up if you don't believe me) and the ""sexual content"" is not tastless and vulgar as the last two games.

It would work in the menus, but any mouse input in-game would be completely ignored.			"

												Ah... GTA: Vice City.A PS2 classic, and almost any 90s kid remembers playing this Rated M game on their sibling's console.Spamming all the cheats you could find on that old Windows 98 PC. Hmmm... Nostalgia.This game's graphics were awesome for it's time, and the missions were (Still are... Cough, Cough) a wide range of difficulty. If just for fun, or for the goal of completion, this game is a must have for any gamer, especially GTA fans.This is still my all time favorite GTA with #4 in second and San Andreas in third.I love the voice acing, the racing dynamics, and just all the things you can do in this sandbox-like AI-city atmosphere!10/10 by me, I'd recommend this game to any person who's never played it (Assuming they don't mind the sometimes [often times, lol] inappropriate subject matter).

												Good game, always loved GTA Vice City. Was the start of the GTA Franchise for me.Funny to think back in the day the graphics were amazing.Controls were a little bit off though. Had difficulty playing initally because my mouse would not work, but switched to windows 98 mode and that fixed that issue. Game play also feels a little bit faster than I remember, but that might only be because it has been so long. My theory was because of the better computer specs it runs a little faster than on the PS2. Found fast cars almost too fast to drive and would take the slower ones. Plus in a shoot out amour and health would go down so fast. Still a great game even with the minor issues, good to play when bored.4/5 for me!			"

												This game is about a man named Tony Montana who wants to become the Godfather, so he asks for a little friend at the don's wedding and shoots up the place. It takes place in Miami Vice with police officers and there are lots of shenanagins that take place. I had some troubles keeping up with them, but I find that it was easy when I took my pills (grandpa is getting old you know). This reminds me of my first son and third daughter, boy were they good kids. Why did they grow to resent me? At least your mother doesn't hate me, right Billy?Grandpa gives this game a 10/10 because it has bright colors and flashy billboards and little friends.			"

												First GTA game I ever played, and It will be and always will be my #1 Favorite all time game. The amount of detail, and the entire story line kept me playing for hours and hours never getting bored on Ps2. Since I loved it so much, I have bought the game for Android, Apple, Playstation 2, and PC. I really hope to see someday in the future a Vice City 2. I know there is Vice City Stories, but for some reason, I just couldn't compare it to the original. Tommy Vercetti is perhaps the best GTA character, besides Trevor in GTA V in the Grand Theft Auto series.			"

												For recent laptops, this game can comprehend it, even at an Intel Graphics 3000. Fun game, wish that the game didn't have so many minor problems, but that doesn't mean the game should be bad. I have to say its the only Grand Theft Auto that was depicting the 1980's and this game that was created at its time was the best most people can come up with, and it has a fun story-line too. I wish that I know how to adjust the video resolution if there is any so that its not a square haha.. Ill figure it out eventually. Lovely game.			"

												How do I start with this one?GTA 3 was ground braking and Rockstar improved upon that. The result? One of the greatest games ever made.Bigger map, more cars, you need boats more often. They added bikes and helicopters. You can buy property. There are tons of sidemission and other stuff to collect.The best thing about this game is still the flair. It's outstanding. The story and the characters are cool (and crazy) and the music...The music is amazing, brilliant, astonishing, awesome, amazing etc.!!!!			"

												Awesome games that brings back memories. I really like the atmosphere of the 80's, and especially the music. Entertaining missions with a lot of humour and references to 80's movies/ tv-series. The game mechanics isn't the best and especially the aiming feels off, but that's minor flaws in a otherwise great game. The amount of mods makes the game very customizable and can be renewed for numerous play-throughs.			"

												Despite its aged graphics and somewhat confusing graphics, GTA Vice City is an amazing game that does a very good job at creating a world and atmosphere set in 1986 Miami. A newly released prisoner of 15 years and the main character of the game, Tommy Versetti is the perfect suppliment for this world and your journey through it. The build up to the second half of the game, the characters involved, the game's wonderfully picked set of 80's soundtracks put into radio stations, and the freedom of it all make this a game for anyone interested in the open world genre. As for the graphics, I can't say they're fantastic unless you don't care and enjoy the atmosphere more than graphical fidelity in of itself, but this modpack (which I used through my entire second playthrough) helps with HUD issues, controller support, lighting, etc. It's not essential, but I highly recommend it.

												Used to play hundreds of hours of this before steam was even a thing for me. Still is a good game to go back to, but i will admit that GTA5 does hold a similar amount of fun but with a glossier look.Still, i sometimes come back to Vice City to drive around and re-live the glory days. Good one to have in your collection.			"

Today I purchased and booted up this 14 year old game, and was amazed by how good it still was. The music on the radio, dialogues, graphics, 80s' look and feel... everything is perfect.This game is a timeless classic!I also nominated this game for ""The “Test of Time” Award"" for Steam Awards 2016. I believe that it deserves another award from modern times.			"

												First off let me start by saying that Rockstar DIDN'T ♥♥♥♥ this one up! Both GTA 3 and San Andreas were absolutely wrecked in the console/PC transition department, but this one seems to actually work fine surprisingly enough. Setting is a load of fun, my personal favorite in the GTA series. Miami in the 1980s. Everything is flashy, everything is bright. The soundtrack is incredible. Honestly I'm not too into stuff from the 80s but this game nails it for me. Not to mention there are more weapons, clothing, and places to visit than in the pervious game. The character of Tommy Vercetti is interesting as well. And, unlike, Claude from GTA 3, he talks quite a bit. The gunplay and the main gameplay is decent. Nothing to write home about by today's standards, but it works. This is more of a game (at least for me) is moreso about cruising around listening to the radio and enjoying the city sights.I'd give it a solid 8/10.			"

												My favorite GTA title is unplayable because of poor button controls, even with an official Xbox gamepad. Pros: Great plot feels like it would be right at home as a sopranos spin-off, The music is awesome. The missions are diverse enough to keep you amused. The controller support is god awful, which makes no sense, because GTAIII works fine, so doe's san andreas, IV and liberty city stories, so why make the controls on this one not only different, but impossible to function? 5/10 faggios			"

First love. The one that you first truely have feelings for. One person that you will never forget, their love will leave an imprint on your heart which will be there forever. At the moment you dont care that you will eventually lose them after a break up because that emotion is amazing. Falling in love was the best thing that has ever happened to me, but now that its gone I feel hopeless. Your first love will be one who will be the hardest to get over, the one that can still make you smile even when your having the worst day ever, and the one who after breaking you, you'll still love them. Your first love never leaves. forever "

												Of any game I've ever played I likely have the most nostalgia for this one. This was the video game that got me into gaming. Before this I only casually played videogames whenever I went to a friends. This was the game that made me buy a PS2 and it is the first game I ever 100% completed. There really is no point in listing all of the postives of this masterpiece as I could go on forever. Instead I'll just mention some negatives. -Understandably this game hasn't aged the greatest-Some missions are insanely difficult, so much so that they are not fun at all-I'm spoiled by the newer GTA's ability to swim so that's a continual problem for me at leastHonestly this is one of the few games I can go back to and start all over again without ever feeling bored of it. Seriously, this game is a must play.			"
