												I played Space Siege as a result of a random Steam Roulette spin, and I was blown away by how great of a game it is!The game revolves around the invasion of a race of aliens known as the Kerak, who are bent on the elimination of the human race. The game is top-down, and plays somewhat like Diablo 3. The story is fantastic, with hints of Mass Effect, Dead Space and Deus Ex: HR. Those who enjoy those games will probably love this.The game is a little old, it was released in 2008, and the control system is definitely a little dated. Everything else is generally great, but if you are going to play I would highly recommend you ensure that you had a way to use the keybinds ingame (especially Map, Health Pack and ""Collect all loot"", these are imperative). Sadly, the game has no method of rebinding keys, so this might be a chore. I use a Razer Naga and bound the imperative keys to the sidebuttons and it worked like a treat.I can't emphasise this enough, this game is fantastic! It took me 8-9 hours to fully complete the game, while collecting the sub-story Data Pads, and loved every minute of it. Again, if you liked games such as Mass Effect, Deus Ex: HR, Dead Space, with the playstyle of Diablo 3, you'll enjoy this game a lot.Highly recommended.Nilesy			"

												Is maintaining your humanity more important than your life?Space Siege was a surprisingly good game. With fluid combat gameplay and light-RPG mechanics, Gas Powered Games managed to craft a unique but short story-driven experience. There are plenty of upgrades to pick from, and hordes of enemies to blast through. The combat itself is heavily action-based with little real strategy involved, and the more memorable aspect of this game for me was actually the choices between whether or not to cybernetically enhance myself. The game reminds you, in no uncertain terms, that enhancing yourself will make you vastly more powerful but that each enhancement will also slowly deprive you of your very humanity.So I ask you again: is your humanity worth dying for?

												I liked the Dungeon Siege games, so I wanted to give this a chance despite the bad ratings.After 3 hours in, I can not give a full review, but here are a few thoughts:- most generic setting, story, characters, levels and enemies I have ever encountered in a game- very very boring in every way- super repetitive gameplay, no challenge, no interesting/useful skills- bland shallow RPG elements, irrelevant skill tree ... there is only one way to use all the scrap you collect all the time, no real choices - annoying camera glitches- crashes at start until you find out about some additional drivers you need to install (actually an easy quick fix, described in the forum) Don't waste your time and bandwidth for downloading this, no matter how cheap it might become.

												A great top down RPG that reminded me of Shadowgrounds with RPG type upgrades.  The story is susprisingly engaging and while you don't effect the story a lot with your choices you do have a little impact. The gameplay is solid, the game never crashed on me, the graphics won't wow you but are not an eye sore. Overall it's a good little game. Doesn't break new ground but is pretty polished. Easily worth the $15 asking price.			"

 ""You can’t always get what you want. But if you try, sometimes you get what you need.” At first sight Space Siege looks like a top-down shooter with interesting physical effects and multiple weapons you can customize. However, a closer look at these features reveals that there is only one melee weapon and the rest of your ranged weapons only differ from each other in terms of damage and firing rate (lacking tactical variety).The controls feel awkward and lack precision. In addition, the inability to change the keyboard mapping should be seen as a below-average gameplay feature nowadays.The characters are displayed in a stereotypical way and remain simple points of story related elements. Your only companion, in form of an android, will stay silent during your entire journey.Further shortcomings are the lack of side quests and dismal layout of levels. The cybernetic choices are a bit more meaningful, but its implementation feels rushed and unbalanced.Overall, Space Siege is a simple game with monotonous gameplay. It leaves too much to be desired, in order to be recommended. Achievements: The game has no Steam achievements. Chronology: Space Siege (PC)Top-down shooter(Science-Fiction) – 2008			"

												I played this game a long time ago and i only had to load it once to remember why i stopped playing back then.In the basics this is an RPG lite game. That means that it is an action game with some RPG elements like skills and leveling.In a way the controls feel like Dungeon Siege.Only that had a good story and never got boring..When playing this at first i was happy with the game.After a few hours things got really repetive and in the end i stopped playing and moved on to other games.The problem is that after a while you feel like there is no progress.Not in the gameplay and the graphics that are mostly made of the same textures and grey colours.Combine that with a B like storyline and i in the end couldn't care less anymore.It's not that the game is really bad but compared to what Chris Taylor has done before and after this game, it is mediocre and to simple.Go play the first two Dungeon Siege games, Supreme Commander and Demigod and you'll figure this out pretty quickly.I'd give this game a rating of 5,5 out of 10.So the conclusion is this isn't really a bad game.Graphics are decent, sound ok, the story mediocre and the gameplay is repetive. After a while you'll probably loose interest in this one and not return.I would really like to love this game because of the man who made it but there just isn't much there.It's your choice.You have been warned			"

												I decided to get this game despite the mixed scores. However, all I can say is that the game feels as mediocre as they get. Generic combat, generic corridors, generic enemies, generic humans vs aliens story. Most of the gameplay is an isometric shooter. Point at an enemy with your mouse and shoot. Seems like controls are simple enough. However, the enemies shoot back at you, and your only way to avoid getting shot is to roll dodge, and you have to aim it with the mouse in the direction you want to roll. So somehow you have to manage to shoot and roll dodge at the same time with just 1 mouse. And then we also get the annoying camera rotation, which is inverted. When I want to rotate left, it rotates right, and vice versa. Maybe there's a way to change this, but I didn't see it.You get a robot companion too, but it's just a regular sidekick really who acts as an extra gun in battle. You can give him a few basic commands, like attack, defend, and heal, and you can upgrade his stats just as you can upgrade your own, but there's nothing much else to it. You can probably play the whole game without ever using it.You can also get cyber implants and use skill points to improve your abilities, but it's all presented in a very generic and uninteresting way. Nearly every skill is a passive which just improves your damage or a critical chance by a couple of % and that's it. Not to mention, half of the abilities require you to have a specific cyber implant, and from what I've played so far, I've only found the one for the eye, so there are plenty of abilities in my upgrades menu that I can't use yet, and no idea when I will.The fact that enemies all look and act alike, makes every single battle feel the same. Throw a couple of grenades into the group and fire away till naught's left. Rinse and repeat. But then fighting enemies isn't so bad when you consider that 95% of the time you're walking and backtracking with nothing happening.You might enjoy this game if you're into dungeon crawlers with no story and simply need to play every single one out there, but otherwise I wouldn't really recommend it.

												Following all of the negative comments I see about this game, it exceeded my expectations.  It's clearly a Gas Powered game, remnants of the previous Dungeon Siege ""surprise mechanics"" are present though this is quite different in terms of combat as you're in full control rather than watching and managing.  I would have preferred a leveling system and random gear than the linear progression the game provides, that would have allowed much more flexibility though I can see where it wouldn't make much sense given how short the game is.  If I had one complaint it would be that the game feels like one big marketing campaign for the period sensitive Ageia PhysX, while that was entertaining at first there was so much of it that I couldn't help but think the game was made for PhysX rather than it being a feature of the game.  Nevertheless I'm glad I played it, it was certainly entertaining for the 10 hours it took to complete.  If you're a fan of the late Gas Powered Games then you likely enjoy this as well.			"

												Nice game for a weekend, if you're into hack-and-slash isometric genre =)Pros:+ Decent storyline;+ Two possible endings, depending on the player's choices;+ A chance to become an Eeeeeeevil Cyborg (""Resistance Is Futile"" (c));Cons:- Installation is messed up by Steam. The easiest way to cure, as was described by many people on the forums already, is to first download & install non-steam demo of the game (can be found for free on the internet - google ""Space Siege demo""). You don't have to keep the demo around afterwards, just launch it once then delete safely - its installation just includes driver package that the steam version lacks.			"

												Space Siege is a game where I can barely recommend. It’s playable, has some interesting ideas behind it however the bland environments and the annoyingly repetitive nature of the game play prevents it from rising beyond a mediocre Diablo clone set in space.The game thrusts players in the role of Seth Walker, a security office on space ship that is escaping a genocidal attack by a race of killer insect-like aliens. Things start off looking abysmal for the surviving members of the ship but Walker proves to be a capable fighter and is set out alone to look for survivors and find a way to get the aliens off the ship.The interesting ideas that I mentioned earlier take the form of weapons and a robot sidekick that can be upgraded and the most impressive part is the upgrading of Seth himself. The player can choose to add cybernetic enhancements to Walker to increase his effectiveness of destroying the alien scourge on the ship but the only downside is that he loses his humanity with every part replaced by machine. This doesn’t seem like much by itself but it works into the narrative and it’s pretty important since the ship’s AI is helping humanity make its final stand but also has its own plan for the surviving members.Unfortunately that’s about it for the exciting parts of the game. You’ll fight through numerous parts of the ship against hundreds of copies of the same enemy’s that pretty much all act the same way for about 12 hours until the game is completed. The story does branch out near the end depending on some decisions made throughout the game or in the end but there’s really nothing groundbreaking here.The fellow survivors are decent so the game isn’t a total downer even though they are a bit too formulaic. They each have their own point of view that mirrors the end decision. It’s just a shame that the weapons and the humanity/cybernetic choice don’t really make killing the same enemies over and over again any more exciting. The environement's cut and paste feeling doesn't help to add to the variety eitherLike I mentioned, I barely recommend this game. It’s up to you to decide if a fairly predictable story with some interesting gameplay elements outweighs 12 hours of tedious destruction of a brainless and uninteresting enemy. It did for me…kind of.

												I love dungeon crawlers of most kinds. Dungeon Siege is a game I always found to be great, and I got Space Siege a few years ago hoping it to be Dungeon Siege but, you know... IN SPACE.The result, however, is a mess of a game that is simply not fun. Looking back, it tries to play somehow like a third person Dead Space, without any of the things that make Dead Space work. If you want a dungeon crawler, there's much better out there. If you want a space shooter there's also much better out there. I guess there aren't many, if any, space-based dungeon crawlers, so if that's your niche you'll have to settle for this. Otherwise, however, don't get this game. It's just not worth it when compared to other similar titles.			"

												Imagine Diablo 2 with a generic sci-fi plot, no real loot system and a general lack of charm. If for some reason this sounds appealing, then you'll only have to cope with awkward controls (LMB to move, RMB to shoot, no ability to backtrack despite the abudence of melee enemies) and bad voice-actingI admit that I didn't make it very far into this game, but as an isometric action game in the vein of Diablo it leaves a lot to be desired. As a Space RPG touting the moral dilemma of cynernetic modification, it utterly fails in comparison to the Deus Ex series. Finally, as a game it simply fails to entertain.

												Having finally managed to get the game to work (you have to track down and install the demo, for cybertron's sake), I finished the game in about 9 hours (spread out between sleeping and other things).  The story could've used more work, and having one character insist you must install a cybernetic enhancement and then have another tell you ""No! Dont!"" got old.  Never did find out who the girl was.Keeping your unaugmented character healed got to be a bit of a pain, since while you could carry piles of explosives, you were only ever allowed 4 med kits.  Ever.   I heard that the cybernetic branch lets you self heal.			"

												If you liked the clunky point-and-click controls of the first two dungeon siege games and the powers of the second, but hated the variety of NPCs, the story line, depth of characters, variety of enemies, different landscapes, different classes, character customizations, pack mules/pets, loot, side quests, and party, this game is for you. In this game, you play the painfully stereotypical soldier Seth Walker who must save humanity and sacrifice himself, blah blah blah. Character upgrades are extremely limited, the only party member you have is a mute robot, NPC interaction typically amounts to ""Go kill the aliens!"" and the enemies are repetitive and uninspiring: first aliens, then robots, then cyborgs, then alien cyborgs, then more robots. The story also seems to only survive by continually trying to pull twists on you that turn out to be less ""Fight Club""-esque shockers and more afternoon soap opera twists added for more drama and to extend the narrative to inhuman lengths. Seriously, if you're looking for a sci-fi RPG, play Fallout, Mass Effect, Star Wars KOTOR or System Shock. The only real plus to this game is the disappointment you feel from it prepares you for the disappointment you'll have if you play Dungeon Siege 3.			"

												I finished the campaign this week. Along the way I opted to upgrade myself part-by-cybernetic-part, trading my humanity in for better stats. From the beginning, the game makes it appear the choice to upgrade or not is an important decision. The upgrade station gives you a running % of how much of your humanity is left and other characters will attempt to persuade your decision for and against. Ultimately it doesn't matter. I finished the game with 20% of my humanity left (I missed the chest upgrade somewhere along the way), and it affected the ending in no discernible way.Space Siege is an enjoyable game. Combat is fun and satisfying. Finding parts for and upgrading your robot buddy HRV adds to the game in a good way. The story throws a couple of twists your way and provides good motivation for your character minus the plot holes left by your choice of cybernetic upgrades. Having said that, I can only recommend Space Siege to fans of the genre. It does nothing truly spectacular. An average game. Get it on sale or not at all.			"

												Without question the best clinical depression simulator on the market. After only half an hour of playing this game, your brain chemistry will be permanently altered. ""Sure, I shot that alien,"" you'll think, ""but why? What's the point? Am I having fun? Is anything fun anymore?"" Soon after, an inconquerable malaise will sap all color and joy from your life. Such is the power of Space Siege.			"

												Across multple machines and operating systems I've never gotten this game to even start up.  Except once for 5 minutes at a friend's house.  This is the only game I've ever wanted to return for a refund during the more than 7 years I've been using Steam.  Booooooooo!			"

												A nice little ARPG. Are there better? Sure. But we all know those titles, and have had our fun with them. For a little game with a little price tag it's fun. I wouldn't spend more than $10 on it but it's worth the $10.			"

												-------------------------Updated Review:-------------------------Wow, this game really is awesome!  After having finished the game, I have to amend my original review.  The control scheme took very little time to get used to and I actually like it now.  As for the level design and enemies, this game did as well as most any I've played - there were enough different enemies to keep it interesting and though there was not a ton of variation in environment, the levels were still each unique enough to make it fun.The plot is cool, for a game that's designed to be linear, not an open world for exploring.  I definitely like the upgrade system - if you're diligent about destroying everything for upgrade parts, you'll have more than enough to upgrade yourself, all your weapons, and your robotic companion.  The skill tree is pretty cool - it's important to note that you will not get enough points to fill out the entire skill tree so you have to make some choices about what's best suited to your playing style.One issue I had at a few points during the game is the path-finding ability of the companion robot, though he was able to follow most of the time.  Beyond that, I really have no complaints and it was enough fun that I will likely play through again.-----------------------Original Review:-----------------------I've only played for a little over an hour - just the first couple of missions - and I can see what some of the negative reviews are talking about.  The two main issues seem to be the bad control scheme and repetitive level design.First, the control scheme is pretty wonky - it kind of reminds me of Harbinger, a 2003 action RPG developed by Silverback Entertainment and published by Dreamcatcher Interactive.  It would play a lot better with WASD movement like the Halo games Spartant Assault and Spartan Strike.  Second, I can already see some repetitive design in the environment and the enemies.Despite these issues, I'm really enjoying the game so far.  I like the (admittedly simple) skill tree and the weapon/armor upgrade system.  It's certainly not an in-depth system you'd expect out of a more hardcore RPG but it's a nice, light, action RPG, reminiscent of games like Diablo.  It would be nice to be able to carry more than four health packs but that's pretty minor.  Overall, I find it to be a good time-waster of a game.  I suppose my opinion might change as I get further into the game but, so far, it's been a lot of fun.			"

												Space Siege is not a game.  That moniker doesn't even begin to describe the intricate subtleties that swim beneath the surface of this masterpiece of digital existentialism.  What is your purpose?  Why are you here?  What does it mean to be truly human?  These are the questions that Space Siege poses as you delve deep into a narrative morass of emptiness and futility.
