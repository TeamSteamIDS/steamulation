Classic shooter nearly ten years oldIt might seem weird to dedicate a review to a game that came out on november 16th, 2004. Still, Half-Life 2 is no ""ordinary"" game. Even before it's release, it was the most talked about, and surely most anticipated game up till then. Back in 2004, Valve was still primarily a game-developer, Steam had only just been launched in order to streamline the updating-process for the Valve-games (quite an original and ground-breaking idea since back in those day patching one's game could easily turn into a hazardous adventure). Immediately after its release, Half-Life 2 was loaded with critical praise, and almost instantly rose to the top of all lists defining the best games ever. And even today, after ten years, it still tops a lot of those lists.I played it for the first time only five years ago, messing around with the original Half-Life up till then. Five years ago, the game struck me as still very good-looking and a blast to play, even being five years old. Quite recently I picked it up again, to be honest in the first place to get some of the achievements I had missed during my first play-through (I only got really interested in the Steam achievements this year). To my surprise, the game immediately got back under my skin, so I decided to give it another play-through, and I enjoyed it immensely, hence this review.Of course the Source Engine shows its age: up-close textures get quite blurry, but the wider vistas are still amazingly ""alife"", and the colours and general atmosphere are still exciting. The physics engine - a novelty back then - now surely feels outdated, even crappy, but playing around with the famous ""gravity gun"" makes more than up for this, and surely has its funny moments. But in every other respect, this game is a classic and a masterpiece in the true sense of the word. The story is so convincingly told, that I felt myself beeing ""Doctor Freeman"" again, already during the first chapter (which introduces the gameworld in a very ingenious way which has not been surpassed ever since). The level-design is simply awesome. Compared to modern-day shooters, the interface and the amount of information about the surroundings you get as a player, are minimal. There is no minimap, there are no waypoints, there is no compass, there is no large-scale map. And still, I never ever got lost, thanks to the downright genial way the levels are designed. Still, the amount of freedom you get is great: there are tons of hidden places, byways, or larger spaces to explore, besides the more traditional corridors, but they always manage to lead you in a logical way. This game offers the classic examples on how levels can be optimally designed.Sound, too, is amazing: there is not much in-game music, but when it appears (mostly in the action-packed scenes), it really delivers to the full. Sounds from the guns, NPC's and ambient sounds are extremely convincing. But what still shines most of all is the actual gameplay and the way this games is ""paced"". Sneaky, almost stealth-like scenes alternate with extremely violent action-moments, in a very, very clever way, only to be alternated with puzzles and other moments where thinking is required. The choice of the right gun at the right time is essential, and very rewarding. There is a lot of interaction with other characters, but never up till the point where this gets tedious. And best of all: there are countless moments of surprise, when the story takes a turn for the unexpected. So, yes, this is still a classic, and yes, it's still up there among the best games ever (although I personally would grant it a top-five place or so, the top-three spots taken by more recent ""classics"").For my scorings, I give them as I conceived the game during my actual playthrough, so not taking into account it's a ten year old game.Gameplay: 27/30 (there are some frustrating puzzles and some weird moments with the gravity-gun but everything else is sheer genius)Grahics: 15/20 (the outer vistas are great, the rest is showing its age)Sound: 9/10Longelivety: 8/10 (no multiplayer, but the game has tons of singleplayer gameplay)Steam integration: 10/10 (it comes with trading cards and 33 achievements, most of which really add something to game, if only to explore different ways to achieve things - the way achievements should work imo)Technical: 9/10 (runs very smoothly and I got no crashes, but sometimes hangs for a couple of seconds on loading screens)Personal appreciation: 10/10Overall: 88/100			"

												This one of the best first person shooter games I've ever played, plain and simple.Half Life 2 begins 20 years after the original Half Life. As Gordon Freeman awakens from stasis he finds himself on a train heading to City 17 which is overrun by the combine. You find yourself as the leader of the resistance and you must take down the Combine. Half Life 2 is at this point one of the best received games and I'm sure pretty much everyone has played it. If not well what the hell are you doing reading this review ? You need to go buy this game straight away and play it right now.The game is a simple first person shooter, but it does plenty things different than the regular first person shooters. You have a health bar and you have to do platforming to solve some of the puzzles.  Not to mention the source engine physics are absolutely insane. For a game that came out back in 2004 it still looks amazing. Now while it does have so low res textures it's still looks breath taking, like in the final chapters.The game for the most part is pretty easy. I played through the game without a problem, even though some segments were tough due to the fast movement you have to pull off to avoid gunfire. Not to mention the Strider battles are incredibly intense and quite difficult.The game took me 10 hours to finish. I felt this was the perfect amount of time for the price I paid for it and this was worth every single penny.Apart from the single playthrough there's not much replay value. The only reason to replay it twice is to look for the G-Man Easter eggs. In the end Half Life 2 is a fantastic game. It's a must own for everyone who is a gamer. This game is a piece of history and without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life.I experienced zero problems while playing the game. I ran the game on ultra settings 60 FPS the entire time of playing. This game runs really well and should run on pretty much all systems.Final Rating:9.5/10 -  A Must own and must playIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												Half-Life 2 takes a minimilist approach to story development, but delivers a rich, atmospheric, and engaging world that sucks you right in. Combined with novel gameplay elemetns (one of the first mainstream games to make proper use of physics in gameplay), an ensemble of likeable characters—topped off with the much loved Alyx Vance, and well paced combat, this helps to make Half-Life 2 an all-time classic.

NOTE: Related ContentAlso see my:Half-Life (1) ReviewHalf-Life: Opposing Force ReviewHalf-Life: Blue Shift ReviewBlack Mesa ReviewTL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Half-Life 2 is a first-person shooter game developed and published by Valve Software (Corporation) and is a sequel to the extremely popular and revolutionary 1998 game Half-Life. Half-Life 2 was originally released back in 2004 and was then boasting the newly developed, highly flexible and powerful Source Engine, it then became an instant classic by making good use of new technology, excellent storytelling, gameplay mechanics and an unrivaled online experience. Alongside its predecessor, both games left a lasting impression, particularly on the FPS genre, as an industry standard for future FPS games to come.PLOT (No Spoilers):Half-Life 2 puts the player once more behind the thick-framed bulletproof glasses of Gordon Freeman, an MIT Graduate of Theoretical Physics with an uncanny ability to wield military hardware and the person indirectly responsible for opening a portal to an alien world and exposing Earth to an invasion that is to be known as the 'Black Mesa Incident'. Half-Life 2 is set 20 years after the events of Half-Life 1 and the world is now under the full control of the 'Combine', an interdimensional empire that is currently harvesting the natural resources of Earth including the human race which is now close to extinction.PROS:+ Graphics and artstyle that looks just as good as it is now (2015), as it was eleven years ago (2004).+ Excellent sequel with an excellent story that expands the Half-Life Universe+ Excellent memorable supporting characters such as Alyx Vance+ Great sound quality, facial animation, and voice acting adds to the immersive experience+ Excellent enemy AI+ Great level and environment designs but...(see CON #1)+ Fun gunplay and gameplay mechanics+ Good selection of weapons and equipment with very creative special abilities (Gravity Gun)+ Atmospheric with excellent use of lighting, sound effects and environment design+ Challenging difficulties+ Expanded levels that give some room for exploration, but doesn't destroy the narrative storytelling+ Lengthy game time+ Very affordable price (though I highly recommend the Half-Life Complete pack)+ Multiplayer is still active as far as I can tell+ Tons of available mods that expand player experienceCONS:- Driving section may be a little too long but it does offer a few 'stops' where the player can stretch his leg muscles and trigger finger.- The Squad Support AI is down right suicidal with no command to tell them to stay in place for more than 15 seconds before they follow you again. (This is annoying specially if you're trying to keep them alive against particularly deadly opponents such as Striders)- Rag-doll physics engine can be unrealistically (albeit hilariously) glitchy- No Steam Workshop Support for the multitude of MODS that are available.CONCLUSION:Much like its predecessor, Half-Life 2 is a MASTERPIECE of a game and is a MUST BUY and MUST OWN for any fan of the first person genre because how else can you describe a game that is almost 11 years old, yet, can still retain all the fun and excitement of a recently released title.WORTH IT?:If you decide to purchase and try this game, I do recommend you purchase Half-Life: Complete so you may also avail of the two Episodes that was subsequently released.FINAL NOTES:Half-Life 2's use of the amazing Source engine reflects on the fact that this game's graphics, despite showing some age, still manages not only to look good, but also to look authentic and atmospheric with its excellent use of sound and music that makes the environment feel alive. Graphics aside, the gameplay has survived for even after a decade and has still not lost its charm. The enemy AI provides an imposing challenge while gunplay and the creative weapons creates one of the most fun and immersive experience you can get on a first-person shooter. Storywise, the Half-Life universe can be considered as one of the most beautifully crafted worlds in gaming history. Half-Life 2 fully emphasizes this point with its amazing and memorable supporting characters that can establish a connection with the player on an emotional level. To recap, Half-Life 2 is the game that once again redefined how modern first-person shooters will be made in the future and remains as the benchmark for good single player FPS gaming experience.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Im aware this is probably the most reviewed game on Steam, making my own take on this game quite redundant (is there anyone with a unique opinion of HL2, not shared by anyone else? Doubt it).However, i noticed the two best games i got on Steam that i havent reviewed yet happen to be the 2 best FPS's of all time, so here's the first review of the two:Half Life 2 is the role-model for all FPS games ever made:It ""only"" has a singleplayer campaign, but its so well done it doesnt need anything else.- Graphics-wise, know this: it's a 2004 game, i played it on 2010 and not once did i feel they were outdated (then again, im not one of those who care a lot about technical aspects)- Sounds... this is not a type of game where this aspect is very relevant, so i cant recall anything about it really- The Story, even though its not the most original or filled with amazing plot twists, it is still compelling and engaging, making you care about its great characters and what happens next- Gameplay, there's where this game excels. From the now-classic 'no cutscenes / always in control', to the incredible variety of scenarios in each level, each with its own tone and pace, and jam-packed with (this is my favourite aspect of the game...) UNFORGETTABLE MOMENTS - seriously, i can recall more than 10 scenes that i'll probably never forget about this game. The weapons are also great, in quantity, diversity and in the fun-factor. The enemies too are varied enough and provide a reasonable challenge (though an higher difficulty level would be great).- The length of the game is also one of the best / longest i've seen in an FPS, though it provides little replay value once finished.Conclusion: Must-play for any gamer out there, to experience a landmark in videogame history, proving again that Valve knows how to make Greatness. Note: Episode 1 and 2 equally recommended to continue the Awesomeness!			"

												Half-Life 2 is a BLAST to play. Pretty much everything in the game is interactive. You pick up paint cans with the gravity gun and when the can hits, it splatters the object with paint. It always fun to pick up a saw blade and toss it at a creature splitting it in half. If its there you can almost be assured that it can be used.The controls in Half-Life 2 are the exact same as the original Half-Life so veterans will be able to pick up and go very easily. For newcomers to the series the controls are very easy to pick up and very practical. After playing with this control scheme you probably will set all of your FPS games to it.I played the game in normal difficulty and it was pretty challenging, but not too hard. I found myself reloading a lot, and even after doing parts in the games over and over again I was still having fun trying to pass it, unlike some other games I have tried. Even though you may load a lot I found that ammo was hardly an issue. The supply crates are pretty much random and give you what you need the most. So if you are running low in shotgun shells, the next crate probably will contain some. This is helpful but at times I felt that I had too much ammo.The story takes place a number of years after the Black Mesa incident. The G-man awakes you on a train and talks to you for a moment and then vanishes. You soon get off the train and arrive at a place called “City 17”, ran by a dictator figure known as Dr. Breen, your former administrator at Black Mesa. You don't really know why you are there, or how you got there and the Combine roaming around the streets don't seem too friendly. You play through the entire game through Gordon Freeman's eyes really immersing you in the game.I was always in awe throughout the whole game. This game has the best graphics I have seen on any game. The people look life-like. They display their emotions so well that you know what they are feeling. The buildings and the atmosphere are awe-inspiring. You may never want to leave City 17 after you see its beauty. The different lighting in each area was great. You actually felt like you were progressing through the game when you start out in day time, and soon you see the sun setting and then it gets dark again.The music in this game was awesome. You could tell when a big battle was coming because the music would start playing, and your blood would start pumping. The music made the game that much more enjoyable. I listen to the soundtrack and I can see the battles without actually playing the game. That in my opinion is what makes the battles so great.The sound in the game was great. I loved the sound the combines made when they died. Each character had a distinct voice and had astounding voice acting. I have never been as freaked in a game when I hear a howl off in the distance and hear a rain gutter banging letting me know that a fast zombie is climbing up after me. The only reason why this score got a 9 is that there is some stuttering when the game loads or auto saves which can be very annoying.This game took me more than 20 hours to complete after playing around in the game with the physics and such, so it wasn't that short of a game, especially for an FPS. This game is definitely replayable. After playing through the game I invited my friend over so he could play it. He found different ways to kill creatures and solve puzzles that I never thought of, so that in itself is a great reason to replay the game. Also the game on hard is much more difficult than normal giving you more challenge as you go around a second time. Why an 8 then? Well the multiplayer is non-existent as of right now so I can't see myself playing it as much as I could be.This game is the best game this year. The graphics, physics, AI, music and sound strung around a well woven story make for a great time. You should definitely buy this game. If you computer can't handle it then its worth the price of upgrading. Reviewer's Score: 10/10 | Originally Posted: 11/22/04			"

												We remember the Freeman. We are coterminous. There is no distance between us. No false veils of time or space may intervene. We see you still in Black Mesa. Clearly we see you in the Nihilanth's chamber. We bear witness to the bright eternity of the Nihilanth's demise. You leap, you fall, we see you flash between the barriers. We are there still, in observance of your final stroke. While our own lay scattered at your feet, you severed the vortal cord that bound the Nihilanth to life, and to us. That sharp spur of hope has not dulled to this day. For once the lesser master lay defeated, we knew the greater must also fall in time.For a brief time you joined with us. You are one. Between the worlds. Communion of the Vortessence. And that other: a deeper mystery. No deeper than the void itself. We cannot forget those whose cords you cut. Forgiveness is not ours to bestow. Unity of purpose, the shattering of common shackles, a single road we tread. Your song we sing and shall sing for eternity. No matter the consequences of this struggle. You have brought us grief and jubilation beyond measure. With you beside us, a talisman of victory, the day of freedom draws nigh.Your bright face obscures your darker mask. We call you sib, although your mind and meaning are a mystery to us. Far distant eyes look out through yours. Something secret steers us both. We shall not name it. We have endured these chafing bonds for eons, yet a single moment of further servitude seems intolerable! How often have we slipped our yoke, only to find it choking us again. Let this war end in either total victory or our extinction. No further compromise shall we allow. We take our stand beside you, here, upon this miserable rock.The way ahead is dark for the moment. What seems to you a sacrifice is merely, to us, an oscillation. We do not fear the interval of darkness. We are a tapestry woven of Vortessence. It is the same for you if only you would see it. How many are there in you? Whose hopes and dreams do you encompass? Could you but see the eyes inside your own, the minds in your mind, you would see how much we share. We are you, Freeman. And you are us.			"

												(Re-written review)Half-Life 2, an ageless classic of PC games, the title that put Valve on the map, the reason Steam exists today and one of the most ground-breaking titles of it's time. I'm going to say right now to those who haven't played Half-Life 2 to do so immediately, as it is an incredible game that to me has triumphed over the tests of time and remains high on the list of video games that can never be bested.Half-Life 2 is just about perfect in every regard: from it's carefully forged story to the perfected pacing, from unforgettable characters to a steady challenge curve. The entirety of Half-Life 2 is a journey leading the player full circle in their quest to liberate humanity from their omnipresent multidimensional conquerers, the Combine. But if the game wasn't already grand enough, Valve gives the player ultimate control over their physics engine with the highly beloved Gravity Gun (you can call it the Zero-Point Energy Manipulator, if you really want to), a weapon that has never been equaled in any game since. The Gravity Gun allows you to pick up objects from the world, like barrels, sawblades, crates and anything you can move and use them as protection against enemy fire or throw them at your foes in a satisfying method. This is even encouraged by the developers, for the level immediately after you recieve the Gravity Gun you are placed in a zombie-infested town with limited ammo and plenty of sharp, explosive or otherwise deadly-when-hurled-at-100kph objects. In other words: A playground for your new best friend. So if you're a recent gamer looking for a timeless classic or a veteran tired of all the two-weapon inventory crap in modern games, I sincerely and whole-heartedly recommend Half-Life 2 for an experience that has never been topped.

												Awesome single player game, mainly thanks to it's AMAZING scenario and it's really immersive aspect. It's probably even the best FPS solo game I've ever played after Portal. As usual in Valve games, there is no cutscenes, all events are lived through Gordon's eyes and that's what makes it so immersive. There are some great passages where you really need to search well for an entry, a way out... The game universe is really great even tho the game doesn't explain much about it. (Combine occupation, Gordon's story... etc) That's why you should raelly browse the wiki for more infos. Many things remind of portal (the musics) (the citadel, that huuuuge building reminds a lot of portal 2) and the 2 games are even supposed to take place at the same time. (There are some allusions to Black mesa in portal and some allusions of Aperture in HL).However the game can be a little buggy, and the achievements are bugged as usual in Source games... Excellent jeu solo, surtout grace a son super scenar et son coté immersif. C'est meme surement le meilleur FPS solo auquel j'ai joué apres portal.Comme d'hab dans les jeux Valve, pas de cinématiques, on vit tout à travers les yeux de Gordon, et c'est ce qui rend le jeu si immersif.Il y a de bons passages ou il faut bien chercher pour une sortie, une entrée... etc.L'univers du jeu est vraiment enorme meme si le jeu n'explique que peu de choses dessus (l'occupation Combine, l'histoire de Gordon...etc ) c'est pourquoi ca vaut vraiment le coup de jeter un oeil au wiki. Beacoup de choses rappelent Portal (la musique, l'ambiance sur les bords) (le citadelle, qui rappele portal 2) et les 2 jeux se passent meme en meme temps, dans le meme univers (il y a des  allusions à Black Mesa dans Portal et des allusions à Aperture dans HL)Seul défauts le jeu bug un peu et les succés eux buggent aussi pas mal, comme d'habitude dans les jeux source.

5 out of 5Half Life 3 now, please.What to say about Half Life 2? If I could even explain a fraction of my adoration of this game...it would probably overwhelm you. This game is one of a kind. Taking everything good from the FPS genre and gaming in general, Half Life 2 is a feat I can't fathom.The gameplay is slick, the sound is platinum album status, the characters will stay with you, and the storyline will grip you. If you haven't already bought this game whilst I've been talking, why haven't you?!?!?!			"

Rise and shine, Mr. Freeman....Overall Rating: 9.5/10This is the ONLY game than runs for more than a hundred FPS on my integrated laptop, old engine but packs a punch for the graphic. Right from the start of the first chapter, Half Life 2 never failed to amaze me by its spectacular map view after you walk out from a certain point of the game. The combination of sound effects, the astounding map lightings, even the movement and behaviour of the AI soldier (well... mostly) creates a solid realistic feels to the game itself, that gives a good first impression to the players of what the surrounding is going to be.The combat in Half Life 2 feels more lively compared to the first Half Life, the Manhunt, the flashing drones and the soldiers are more intelligent that adds a lot of challenges and varieties into the combat scene. Zombies models are well-improved, the voices for the zombies plus the jumpscare events creates a good mix of panic and suspense feels, thus forcing players to act faster and be decisive during the playthrough. The weapons are well designed, the animations and the sounds of them are great that makes the shooting experience a lot more fun. One thing I don't like a bit, is that the accuracy of the rifle and smg are bad, that bursting and tapping doesn't make any difference. Let's just not nitpick about it, Half Life 2 is already greater than I can imagine.Now what's Half Life without puzzle? they're created with more variaties attached to, most of them involves physics while the others are fun to discover and solve. The lazer pointer that guides the rocket launcher's missile, the boat and buggy shoot-while-driving scene, they're all creative, very fun to play, and gives a lot of joy after you actually solved it by yourself.I honestly feel that the thing that makes Half Life 2 great game, is that how enjoyable it is for all ages. There's lore attached to it, there's also story-related events that makes the play a lot more entertaining, that I'm very recommending this to people who are willing to try something enjoyable.For the people who actually OWN this game but never play it, sad that you've missed a part of the FPS history...

												Six years is a long wait for a sequel, but it was well worth it.  In that time, Valve created their own game engine, known as Source, and with the Gravity Gun quickly became THE game to copy.  Like ClassicDOOM before it, most FPS games that came after Half-Life 2 valiantly attempted to copy the in-game physics engine that allows to to catch and repel in-game props.  Many of them succeeded, but Half-Life 2 was the first to do it, and gamers know where to give credit where credit is due.Once again, you play as Gordon Freeman, mute savior of humankind.  Reawakened by the G-Man from the previous game ""some time later,"" you find that the world as you know it is no longer.  The Combine have successfully invaded and subjuated humanity, and it's only a matter of time before Man becomes just another X-stamp on the Combine's evolutionary whiteboard.  Unless you can rise up to the challenge of liberating your very species, that time will approach far quicker than you'd like.One of the first FPS games to introduce drivable vehicles, adding the Gravity Gun is just icing on this cake (that's a metaphor, not a lie).  Chock full of references and easter-eggs, Valve should be proud that their title has continued to successfully carry the FPS banner.			"

												So wake up Mr. Freeman - Wake up and smell the ashes...Fresh install again for HL2, such an Epic game for single player.  The layout of this game is tremendous diverse locations and fun firefights.  For many, including myself getting this game meant - getting STEAM? - what was it, how will it work and such.  At the time Steam was a bit buggy and had some issues but that was 10+ years ago and look at it now... its come a long way.  Half Life for me is almost like a bad habit I keep going back to after 16 years of playing HL and 10 years of HL2 I always go back for another run - because there fun!  Why are they fun - its a unique world, decent graphics (top of the line when released), awesome game play, good AI, Killer music and soundtracks, fun characters and the MOD options.  My favorite levels in the game are Nova Prospect & Ravenholm... 2 fantastic levels.  Headcrab zombies and poison crabs - suck especially the poison crabs they make my hair stand up and the sound they make - (girly scream).I am all about Half Life again after my mini rant earlier in the week and the somewhat troublesome news from Valve regarding HL3 - please see the rant in the activity feed.  VALVE CAN NEVER LET THIS GAME END WITH OUT A PROPER FOLLOW UP AND EXPLANATION OF THE MANY LOOSE ENDS AND MY PERSONAL FAVORITE QUESTION - JUST WHO EXACTLY IS THE GMAN AND WHY IS HE PORTRAYED THE WAY HE IS?  Recommended game if your the one person out there that has not played it yet, lol.			"

												Nothing I say will make a difference at this point. I've dreaded reviewing Valve games since Steam reviews first started, because it's a developer I've placed on a very high pedestal, so objectivity is not on the menu. Half-Life 2 is something you've already played long ago or something you sought out just recently, because you wanted more from an FPS. For the past 7 years or so, I've been on a quest to watch movies that left a permanent mark in film history. I sought out those films for that reason alone. If you're on a similar quest with games, you're bound to meet Half-Life 2 on your path. It's a special breed of FPS, an experience so refined that to this day it stands above the rest in the genre, which is why it's my nominee for The ""Test of Time"" Award in the first Steam Awards.If you are completely new to Half-Life, the most envious position to be in, all things considered, then start with the first game. Half-Life, Half-Life: Source or Black Mesa, take your pick. Half-Life 2: Update is another thing to experience. And congratulations, you are now part of the most desperate group of people among gamers. The wait of a sequel and may it be as short as possible for you. Savor your journey from Half-Life to Episode Two and after you've replayed them once or twice, maybe, just maybe you will then hear the happy news we've all been waiting for.			"

												Half-Life 2. The video game that started the modern generation on first-person shooters and revamped the gaming history into a new era. Originally released in November 2004, the game won multiple game of the year awards and branched gameplay mechanics, including physics and the state-of-the-art game engine that look realistic during its release date. Many people are aware on the game’s popularity and everlasting legacy including various jokes on the awaiting sequel (for many years), but the question remains: Why is this game popular?The game takes place after the events from Half-Life. You play as Gordon Freeman, the silent protagonist who got a Ph.D. on theoretical physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and knows how to use weapons very effectively; a strange paradox for a character with such features yet highly popular and well-recognized. You are sent to City 17 by the G-Man, a mysterious person or a phenomenon with a mysterious and ambiguous agenda, to overthrow Wallace Breen and the alien oppressors, the Combine. The setting and lore in the Half-Life universe is simply the best, taking some influence from George Orwell’s 1984 or other famous dystopian novels to set the story in tone. Gordon’s influence and previous actions will spark oppressed citizens in City 17 to take arms and revolt against the Combine. From City 17 to the prison at Nova Prospekt, each setting is unique, bleak, but beautifully designed, the game simply defined what a video game should be. Each NPCs and major characters such as Doctor Issac Kleiner, Barney Calhoun, and other characters interact realistically among each other and to you. In regards to Alyx Vance, your ally and companion, Valve spawned the concept of AI teammates and became a true asset in your journey to rally up the oppressed citizens. Besides good character developments, the best attribute for Half-Life 2 was physic interactions and the game engine. The game engine is Source, which feature high-dynamic range rendering, facial animations, and “realistic physics”; the first game that had such a feature like this. Are there criticisms for the game? I believe so, but to be honest, I couldn’t find any legitimate criticisms for the game. If one criticism has to be addressed, then the problem is the loading sections. Yes, those tedious loading that interrupted the “flow” in the middle of a long level or after finishing a series of firefights against Civil Protection or Combine forces. These loading or “checkpoints” really halt the immersion in the game. However, this is very common on all Half-Life games and I hope that Valve would address this (if they are working on the sequel…). Half-Life 2 is pure gold, shining flawlessly on the test of time. With great graphical fidelity at its time, voice acting and realistic AI interaction from your allies and enemies, this game is a rare exception of genuine perfection and grand role model for other game developers to pursue their own game designs. The only thing Half-Life 2 (and its episodes) is a full fledge sequel. Besides many jokes, anxieties, and waning patience for Valve to announce the sequel, the game should be in every PC gamer’s Steam library. No exception. Half-Life 2 is simply the best; a grand overture that started and defined the modern gaming industry in the present time.  "

												I'll tell you a story.Once, I went to my grandma's house in March- the THIRD month of the year. It was also the THIRD. I arrived at my grandma's house at 3:33. She has THREE houses on her block. I went up to the door, which had THREE chips on it, and knocked THREE times. After THREE seconds, she said: ""Be right there!""- it had THREE words in it. She came up to the door and took off THREE locks on her door. She invited me into the kitchen for cookies, while all of her THREE cats ran past me, one of which had THREE spots on him. She told me to sit down next to the table, which had THREE chairs. She handed me the platter with THREE cookies on it, and said that her THREE cats took THREE of the cookies THREE times. So we sat down for THREE minutes, and talked about THREE subjects: Major companies, Games, and Numbers. After that, we sat in my grandma's living room, and watched THREE different channels. After a while, she started to get thirsty, so I generously got up from one of the THREE sofas, went into the kitchen, and opened the fridge. I spilled THREE drinks, but I got more for my grandma. When I came back into the room, she was watching a commercial for a product that said: ""If you don't get it in THREE days, it's free! Only $33.33!"" I sat down and started reading a magazine for children- the THIRD issue. It was on how to add. 1+1-1+1+1=3. That didn't seem appropriate for a children's book, so I went on the computer in my grandma's bedroom, and found out the company had been in buisiness for only THREE years. Now it made sense. It was time for me to leave because I was going to a party with THREE of my friends. My grandma gave me THREE seashells as a present, which I thanked her THREE times for. So then I left out the door, walked to my car, and drove away.So, what I'm trying to say is that I had a great time at my grandma's house.			"

												Half-Life 2 is the reason I got into steam and was hooked into PC gaming. When I was a kid, I didn't have no Xbox or Playstation; all I had was my dad's PC with the original Half-Life and Unreal Tournament. Eventually I got my own personal computer when I got older and got a copy of Half-Life 2 in march, 2007. I love this damn game to the bottom of my heart and destroyed my taste in console shooters because of the speed and accuracy of a mouse and keyboard.			"

												John Freeman who was Gordon Freemans brother was one day in an office typing on a computer. He got an email from his brother that said that aliens and monsters were attacking his place and aksed him for help so he went.John Freeman got his computer shut down and wet on the platform to go up to the roof of the building where he left his motorcycle and normal people close because he was in his office lab coat. John Freeman got on his motorcycl and said ""its time for me to live up to my family name and face full life consequences"" so he had to go.John Freeman ramped off the building and did a backflip and landed. He kept driving down the road and made sure there was no zombies around because he ddint have weapon.The contrysides were nice and the plants were singing and the birds and the sun was almost down from the top of the sky. the mood was set for John Freemans quest to help his brother where he was. John Freeman looked around the countrysides and said ""its a good day to do what has to be done by me and help my brother to defeat the enemys"".John Freeman was late so he had to drive really fast. A cop car was hiden near by so when John Freeman went by the cops came and wanted to give him a ticket. Here John Freeman saw the first monster because the cop was posessed and had headcrabs.""I cant give you my lisense officer"" John Freeman said""Why not?"" said the headcrab oficer back to John Freeman.""Because you are headcrab zombie"" so John Freeman shot the oficer in the head and drove off thinking ""my brother is in trouble there"" and went faster.John Freeman had to go faster like the speed of sound and got there fast because Gordon needed him where he was. John Freeman looked at road signs and saw ""Ravenholm"" with someons writing under it saying ""u shudnt come here"" so John Freeman almost turned around but heard screaming like Gordon so he went faster again.John Freeman drove in and did another flip n jumped off his motorbike and the motor bike took out some headcrab zombies infront of John Freeman. John Freeman smiled and walked fast. John Freeman then looked on the ground and found wepon so he pickd it up and fired fast at zombie goasts in front of a house.John Freeman said ""Zombie goasts leave this place"" and the zombie goasts said ""but this is our house"" and John Freeman felt sorry for them becaus they couldnt live there anymore because they were zombie goasts so he blew up the house and killed the zombie goasts so they were at piece.Then John Freeman herd another scream from his brother so he kept walking really faster to get where he was. Ravenholdm was nothing like the countrysides there was no birds singing and the pants were dead and teh dirt was messy and bloody from headcrabs.When John Freeman got to where the screaming was started from he found his brother Gorden Freeman fightin the final bosss and Gordon said ""John Freeman! Over here!"" so John Freeman went there to where Gordon Freeman was fighting. John Freeman fired his bullet from teh gun really fast and the bullets went and shot the final boss in the eyes and the final boss couldnt see.Gordon Freeman said ""its time to end this ones and for all!"" and punched the final boss in the face and the final boss fell. John Freeman said ""thanks i could help, bro"" and Gordon Freeman said ""you should come here earlier next time"" and they laughed.The laughed overed quickly though because John Freeman yelled ""LOOK OUT BRO!"" and pointed up to the top of the sky. Gordon Freeman looked up and said ""NOO! John Freeman run out of here fast as you can!"" and John Freeman walked real fast out.John Freeman loked back and saw Gordon get steppd on by the next boss and he was mad and angry.""I'll get you back evil boss!"" John Freeman yelled at the top of lungs.to be continued..?			"

												In what is arguably a more necessary Steam title to have in one's libary than Team Fortress 2 or Dota 2, Half-Life 2 holds up magnificently as a first-person shooter over a decade since its 2004 release as the first title which required Steam to install and play. The game follows an arc similar to most forms of media, especially film media, with the player seeing highs, lows, and an excellent climax as through the eyes of Gordon Freeman.As stated above, this game remains an amazing title and experience, both in gameplay and in plot, with a great deal of effort directed at character development and map and AI design. You could be told this was released a week ago and would believe it, as both its graphics and physics engine remain top-notch and put to shame those of most other shooters, both at the time and now.The game follows M.I.T. graduate and Black Mesa Research Associate Scientist Gordon Freeman, who, after being placed on a train heading to City 17, faces off against the oppressive Combine Empire that controls the city and the planet. With the help of the resistance movement and old and new friends alike, Gordon fights the Combine as they launch continued assaults against him, viewing his return to be a serious if not the single greatest threat to their dominion.The game is an outstanding example of storytelling, with the arc being one of my favorite in any game released - period. Without a word coming from Freeman's lips, the universe and history of City 17 and Earth in general is greatly explained, and through events the player grows to despise the Combine Empire, which in turn grants extra reward to the player when they succeed in trading blows with it.With an excellent soundtrack composed by Kelly Bailey, the game's means to convey emotion increase, action scenes become more epic, horror scenes become more terrifying, and emotional scenes become more deep and impactful. The game uses its soundtrack in a masterful way, reintroducing old tunes and beats from Half-Life 1, and introducing a new soundtrack that perfectly fits the situation.The game is also masterful at finding a blend of pleasing and challenging a player; Most concepts are introduced by some form of training to help open the player up to them, rather than forcing the player to learn skills on the spot, though the game makes sure not to help the player too much to keep the challenge going.If you haven't bought this game yet on Steam, I strongly suggest you do so. It's an excellent title that has everything a good game should have: Interesting Plot, well-written characters, interesting and fun mechanics, a fitting and enjoyable soundtrack, good map design, excellent world-building, and so on. It stands 12 years since its release in most majestic fashion with the means to challenge most AAA titles ♥♥♥♥ out to the market with its first chapter alone.			"

												Even though its not as good as the first Half-Life, it's still pretty much an excellent game in its own right and still holds up  Very Well in terms of Graphics and Gameplay.Everyone on Steam should have this and the 1st Game in their Library IMHO.Pros++Good Storyline, a Great Tour De Force IMO.+Likeable and Lively Characters.+Best Character Facial Expressions I've ever seen in a Game.+Good and Clever Puzzles, especially the ones that involve use of the Gravity Gun (One of the Best Video Game Guns IMO).+Lots of Great Mods like Black Mesa, SMOD, and Underhell for ExampleCons- -I thought the Enemy Variety was lacking, you fight Combine Soldiers and Synths for most of the Game, and you hardly encounter the Xen Aliens (Save the Headcrab and their Zombie Hosts) from the Last Game (I miss the Houndeye and Bullsquids ;_;).-Compared to the Last Game, the Arsenal felt Generic (The Pulse Rifle was a pretty cool Weapon, though I wish they kept the Tau Cannon or Gulon Gun from the Last one).No matter what I didn't like about this, it gets a 10/10.

												Since this is a first person shooter, let's talk about the guns. For starters you have the basic weapons, pistols, machine guns, a shotgun, grenades, rocket launcher (RPG?) and so on. Some weapons have dual uses like the machine gun has a grenade launcher. The weapons feel very good to use. The pistol has never been so much fun to shoot wow! I'm shocked. The machine guns have real kick to them. The shotgun seems very effective. The rocket launcher is laser guided, which is fun to take down helicopters with. Launch it and guide it to the helicopter, because if you shoot it straight, the rocket will get shot down.The combat is rich and fulfilling with certain segments of driving such as a boat or car segment where you still get out and go into buildings to combat things. There are also puzzles and challenges to breakup the action just like there were with the original game. It keeps you thinking, sometimes over thinking. There are puzzles such as using a crane to move your car, using a washing machine to weigh down a platform and taking out a force field by rolling a car (trying not to spoil). There are less puzzles in this game than the last, most of the puzzles seem to involve combat like using the gravity gun as a weapon.Level design is well thought out. Areas are very realistic and cluttered with things you'd really find in any given area. There are trees, junk, wrecked cars, beds, dilapidated walls, broken floors and so on. It really helps the immersion that these areas feel real instead of a typical video game level. This is a very linear game that does have little points of exploration, but you are cleverly guided through things that catch your eye. Like lights in a room are turned on or a character standing under a light and the game will condition you to subtle cues that they mean ""go here"" or characters will flat out say ""run Gordon! Go now I'll hold them off.""The game has several new or altered enemies. Even the old enemies are more difficult and altered. There are new head crabs, the standard and the venomous kind. For humans that have a head crab on them, they are this game's zombies, smart, difficult, dangerous zombies. You can shoot them in the head, slice them in half, sometimes the head crab will hop off, they scream a horrifying muffled wail, but worst of all... if you don't get moving they will rise again in a matter of minutes. There are several terrifying enemies that with the dark and new lighting really disturbs you and sends a dread through you that other games fail to duplicate. The game really manages to terrify you through other ways, such as traveling beneath a giant bridge actually gives you a sense of height that is strangely intense because you fear falling when clearly this is a video game. Maybe that says something about the game's immersion.Of course there are your run of the mill soldiers, and special ops enemies... but they are intelligent. Several enemies in the game are very intelligent and don't have patterns, but thought processes. Such as if they are injured, they will fall back and get a better position, if they have you pinned down, they will throw in grenades, rush in with guns blazing or bait you into firing at them. They will never line up to be shot; they will fan out so they can all shoot you.In all the game is a lot of fun, but a lot of it isn't, especially if you're a little clueless as to what the story is, because the game won't help you with that right away at least. What might be an intense boat segment of the game might be a long annoyance for some people. Sometimes you can over think puzzles that aren't even really puzzles, but you miss a small lock to shoot off something and end up using the newly acquired gravity gun to pile junk to get over things. What could be a fun car segment with stops in between could be seen as an annoyance to have to stop, because the military has ambushed you or set up a force field.			"

												( I've played all HL games so far in 2016, so no nostalgia involved)Half-Life 1 was okay/good.  I loved Opposing Forces  even more, and Half-Life 2 overall was even better, with some parts of the game not being that good. At the time of writing this review I haven't played the Episodes, so I don't really know info about them. The game starts with GMan telling you that there's stuff to do, and driven by free choice Gordon Freeman does whatever he wants, as long as he follows the corridor the game opens to him. Jokes aside, the game is a huge and long corridor. A very pretty and well done, well built corridor, but still, the game lacks choice and freedom - though it's not really a problem, as the game is action-driven, always happens something that forces you to go further. Attack from beind, tunnels collapsing, or they say the next goal is ahead of you. And here's where one of the things come in the picture that made the game sooo much better for me that HL1 was - change of environment.  HL1 was in Black Mesa and in Xen, and while the two was vastly different, and the level design was great, you still spent most of your time between walls of BM.  On the other hand in HL 2 there are canals, sewers, city landscape, country-like environment, beach, cliffs, a mining town worthy of horror stories, Combine (aliens) base, and street warfare. Not only the level layout changed, but the style as well. Cities had snipers, zombies and headcrabs were abundant in abandoned places, while combine had most power in the city.  So type of the enemies, coupled with the different environments and available weapons at that point made the game really diverse, while it was really consistent, logical by building up that diversity.Things I loved it in game:- Finally a proper story with recurring characters, and not just random people telling me where to go and never seeing them again.  Actually the story was really enjoyable.- Good weapon selection - they are different, and I think all weapons were useful in certain situations. While one can have a favourite weapon, there wasn't useless ones.- Physics are just awesome. The ragdoll after hitting enemies with the crossbow, how explosions throw stuff around, and how *incredibly* well the gravity gun was implemented in the game. The gravity gun is basically a tech bragging from Valve to show off the physics, but instead of it being a show-weapon, they made lots and lots of situations where it was needed. In modern games a lots of new things are used only for a short period, here the Gravity Gun, the driveable buggy and airboat was used for quite a lot of time, G.G. for the most obviously- Secrets, AKA Lambda-locations. They are not really useful if you're at least average with FPS games, as they only give ammo, health and ocassionally shields, but they balance out the game for people who are not too good at FPS, but pay attention to their surroundings. I personally love it when a game rewards you for discovery.And the negative:- Basically character collision. I finally meet Eli and Alyx, I'm just standing, staring at them talking and then Alyx just pushes me away. In SO MANY scripted moments they just push me away instead of properly avoiding me, and it was really, really annoying and immersion breaking.-Character collision 2.0:  you and your squad.  I demand the rights to shoot those terrible soldiers who block eachother and me - they follow me, staying behind like 3-5 metres, and any time I have to go back they bump to me, to eachother, they pushes eachother away like domino pieces, and it's just superfun when a strider is shooting at me.  -Preposition? The game's start is really weird in my opinion. Climbing though a fence, going in a random house, then getting chased because... why? The game tries to show the Combine bad, so the player would rather flee from them (as lack of means to fight back) but in the game it's not even explained why they are there, and who they are. Which is really weird for me, and made me question the actions and happenings in the first few chapters.These are the only things I can't even grasp how they managed to leave in the game, I can't recall anything else more than mildly annoying.Game is still a lot of fun today, and playing it absolutely made me realize how incredily powerful and useful the engine is, and why there are so many mods based on it - the game is fun:  varied enemies and weapons, there are often some mini-puzzles to solve to go further (like collecting 3 car batteries) make the game still a really enjoyable experience. I would recommend playing it if you want a better gameplay experience than a story  - the story is full with mysteries, but playing the game feels much more rewarding than most newer FPS games proved to be for me.

												""Rise and shine,Mr. Freeman,rise and shine""- G-manHalf-Life 2 is the sequel to Half-Life,the game by Valve that pretty much wrote the rules for FPSs way back in 1998.I haven't played very much of this game myself,but I can guarantee that anyone who plays it will end up loving this game,even those that didn't play HL1 before playing this game(like me).  The Story Gordon Freeman is brought out of stasis by the G-Man,who inserts him in a train arriving at the fictitous City 17,which was taken over by Combine forces. He eludes the Combine forces and meets Alyx and Barney,and joins the Lambda Resistance. He gets to Dr. Kleiner's lab and assists them in attempting to get a teleporter to teleport him and Alyx to Dr. Eli Vance's lab. The teleportation fails,and he goes through City 17 on foot to get to Eli's lab. He arrives at Black Mesa East and meets up with Eli, where he is captured and taken to a combine prison,Nova Prospekt. Gordon goes through a zombie infested town named Ravenholm and is given a Dune Buggy,which he uses to travel to Nova Prospekt. Eli,Alyx,and Gordon escape,the combine teleporter they used exploding in the process. Gordon and Alyx learn they were in a ""slow teleport""during which a week has passed. In their absence,the Resistance mobilized against the combine, turning City 17 into a battleground. Alyx is captured by the Combine and taken to the Citadel,with Gordon,aided by Barney and D0g,goes to the Citadel. He gets caught in a Combine""confiscation chamber"",which destroys all of his weapons except for the Gravity Gun,the energy enhancing it's capabilities and turning it into a superior weapon. He is captured riding in a Combine transport pod and is taken to Dr. Breen's office,where he is holding Eli and Alyx captive. Breen explains his plans for further conquest of the humans by the Combine. Breen tries to escape through a portal,but Gordon destroys the portal reactor with the super-charged Gravity Gun. Breen is annihilated in the resulting explosion,but just before Gordon and Alyx get killed,time is frozen,and the G-Man appears,praising Gordon for his actions in City 17 and the Citadel,and puts Gordon back into stasis. The characters are pretty cool,even if some of the characters can tend to be annoying*looks at Barney*The music is pretty cool,tho the game mostly relies on ambiance.The weapons are pretty good,just really your standard FPS weapons,except the Gravity Gun is added,which lets you move almost any object at will. Heck,you get a crowbar also x) :)This is an amazing game overall,it seriously deserves the critical acclaim that it's gotten,and I HIGHLY recommend this game,even to those that haven't played Half-Life before,it's def worth the 10 bucks10/10 from me :)Sweep "

												A near-perfect first person shooter through a convincing, imaginative world filled with believable characters. If you haven't played it already then you should, it holds up well against recent titles and embarrasses a fair few.The game has so many little touches that make it better than its competitors. The shotgun has a tight blast radius, so it's effective even at considerable distances. The gravity gun gave meaning to the rubbish strewn across the levels. Who would have thought a radiator could serve as a weapon, a shield and a useful platform to reach high-up areas? The grenades are satisfyingly clunky, the explosive barrels are meaty and I wish that they sold bugbait stress balls. It's probably the nicest sounding weapon in the world (and beyond).This game needs no introduction. It's the game that single-handedly brought Steam onto desktop PCs everywhere. It had to live up to the standards set by the original and it surpassed it in every way. Graphically it was ahead of its time, with detailed character animations and convincing CLUTTER all over the world. Each level leads straight on from the previous so you can almost draw a mental map of City 17 as you journey towards the looming Citadel in the centre. You can see the sun slowly setting as the levels progress and distant sirens and explosions really draw you into the Eastern-European themed city. There's something very lonely about the echo of a gun shot on the cliff levels.Every chapter has its own theme and alterations to the gameplay. You'll find yourself in vehicles, or battling against a certain type of enemy, or battling WITH that type of enemy against another sort. It really makes me wonder why other developers bother even trying to compete with the creativity that this title offers.Is it perfect? Nhggghhh, almost. I could say that the vehicle sections go on for a bit too long and the quiet, talky sections (which used to be my favourite- LOOK AT THEIR FACES!) have aged a bit. I find myself hitting things with a crowbar, waiting for more enemies to kill.Seriously, if you don't enjoy this game then first person shooters aren't for you.			"

												What else can I say that hasn't already been said about Half-Life 2? The fine folks over at Valve have succeeded in creating not only one of the most immersive experiences a game can offer, but one of the greatest games of all time.  For those who aren't even fans of the first-person shooters, I still encourage you to look into this game. Should you choose to don the HEV suit and take on the role of the crowbar-weilding, badass physicist Dr. Gordon Freeman, I can guarentee you'll be in for the train ride of your life.  I could go on and on about how stellar this game is, but your time would be better spent playing it for yourself.			"

												You see I never liked rhino's, but that's ok cause this game doesn't have them.So when you start the game you are greeted with sexual sounds of raviolli and meatballs, made by famous chef, Adolf Hitler.  But sadly you don't get to enjoy these banana's because then general mc♥♥♥♥face puts you on a train with Morgan Freeman, btw it's not really Tim Alan.  You are then told it's safer here, and the main character, Master Chief, says ""What can you tell me about the reapers?""  So as you make your way through the holocaust, I mean train station you meet your old friend Barney the zebra, and he tells you to ♥♥♥♥ off and get a real job.  And that's when my power cut out because I didn't pay the electric bill.  I then proceeded to get a job at Mcdolan's, and hated every single moment of it.

												Saying this is a good game is like saying water is wet at this point, it's just a given. The pure nostalgia bomb I got from this game is beautiful. It still holds up so many years later. While some of the action later on is pretty darn challenging it's never too much or so much so you feel like you have to give up (the first Half Life had a lot of areas like that, still a good game for the time though don't get me wrong). The dialogue is brilliant and the writing top notch. The characters are really easy to get attatched to- especially Alyx and Calhoun, trust me you'll be wanting them to stay with you the whole game. Definitely a must for people who played the game back in the day and a must for people who want an awesome game. Highly recommended.Kinda leaves you wanting more though.

These are the words that plunge you into the dark world of Half-Life 2. You play as Gordon Freeman, a former theoretical physicist, who years after the Resonance Cascade in Half-Life 1, is taken out of stasis by the mysterious Gman. The adventure that follows is, in my opinion, one of the best you can possibly experience in a game. The graphics in the game are amazing. The game was made in 2004 and the graphics still hold up to this very day. The soundtrack is made up of several electronic and ambient songs, all of which were masterfully composed by Kelly Bailey. The gameplay is action-packed, interactive, and, most importantly, fun as hell. This game is an absolute must-play for anyone who considers themselves a ""gamer,"" or anyone who wants to make games.

From the amazingly well thought out gameplay to the beautiful visuals that still hold up to this day it really is a masterpiece. What the game lacks in visual fidelity it certainly makes a comeback with its great story and its entertaining gameplay... Whether it's killing Combine Soldiers with toilets using the Gravity Gun or shooting down a Gunship using an RPG, the gameplay is satisfying.Pro's:Entertaining Gameplay.Rich cast of characters.Deep story.Diverse gameplay.Cons:No Half-Life 3 yet			"

												This game is acclaimed as being legendary.So, obviously I HAD to play the entire franchise.I'm still hooked on the lore and gameplay.If you're expecting the old fast-paced bangabangkaoombBLAAAMSCHDOWPOPOPOOM of Half Life 1, well, I'll get in to that later.The storytelling and graphics hold up to this day. In fact, some would say they're BETTER than todays. Amazing(?) physics, lighting, and if you get past the mayonaise jar glitch with turret-armed Metrocops, the A.I. is spectacular, often working in squads and providing covering fire for one another, throw grenades, etc.For those old glory fans, this isn't the aftermath of Black Mesa getting nuked. This is the aftermath of a resonace cascade, and gas-masked aliens are here to ♥♥♥♥ up your world view.The level design is certainly iconic. Looming feeling of the Combine always watching you in the Eastern European City 17, sunset-casted and damp Canals, haunting, deathly and heavy night of Ravenholm. Sheer cliffs and winding highways of the Coast, crumbling and invasive metal structures of Nova Prospekt, and the fiery streets of the battle of City 17, soldiers and natural hazards lurking at every corner of the way.Gameplay is, and I'm going to shamelessly compare to HL1, slower than its predecessor, but still lots of fun. Your sprint, possibly to service the more serious storytelling, is literally limited to a meter, and that's WITH the suit. Weapon choice is also notched down from the original, which is slightly dissapointing as well. It's made up, however, for a select iconic masterpiece made specifically for this game: and I'm not talking about any old crowbar. The Gravity Gun is one of the best weapons ever made for a videogame, even if it's introduced quite a ways in to the game.Overall?9.5/10. Very slight imperfections I notice, but otherwise a great choice for any gamer out there.AND THEN THERE'S THE EPISODE-			"

												A lot can be said about Valve's Half-Life 2. In fact so much has been said that it feels redundant just talking about it. Yeah we all know the games amazing story, and the tight controls, and stunning graphics. I mean JESUS look at those graphics! But what really makes HL2 great, besides just the stuff mentioned? We know its the shining crown jewel of gaming, but do we really know why? The short of it is that the game is extremely solid on all fronts, something that truly can't be said about many games. Everything flows, in a way that AAA games still can't come close to, so much to an extent that I feel people sell Half-Life 2 short, even the people prasing it. Sure games today are made for a wider audience and they get that with shiny graphics and a more streamlined cinematic experience. The games are easier because they don't strive to highlight certain mechanics and instead focus on a wide apeal-story based narrative that can be experienced by everyone. But is that really the case? Truly think about it. HL2 doesn't need to pull you out of the world you have been experiencing in first person to show you a cutscene or have the ""tutorial guy"" , you never follow a map marker or preform a one button stealth takedown. Were made to think AAAs today are much better because theres more there, bigger maps, better graphics, and new toys all come with having as much cash that the companies making these games are willing to pump into them. We feel a sense of evolution that comes with the silver wraping under the christmas tree and are ready to easily consume more and more of the worlds were presented with because everything is made for that reason only. On the contrary Half-Life 2 did something more. The world is experienced by the player. The story is subtle and it only unwraps itself as you peel back the layers of the Half-Life world and see what Gordon Freeman, or you the player, has missed in the last 20 years. Half-life 2's story has a dark tone, with creative interiors and exteriors that never stray from the world being presented to you, refusing to abandon the lore of the world or dampen the experience all while flowing perfectly with gameplay and mechanics. The basics of Half-Life were run and shoot. And they sure as hell kept true to that in HL which is why the game is still so critically acclaimed. And HL2 does this but even better. Its a game truly worth of a sequel, being able to take what the predecessor had done and improving on every way while making each aspect better. The world you run and shoot in is the same world you live in. What AAA games take the time to truly accomplish the blending of the main concept of their game with every other aspect or even use it as one of their misguided selling points? The game Half-Life 2 truly speaks for itself in many ways. Once you have heard one person say it you have probably heard it all. And while we might not have listened well enough for this message to rub off on other games, the effects of HL2 will be felt by those who truly look for a reason to love it.			"

												Until recently,  I haven't ever played a Half Life game. It was only when a Youtuber I watch started a series on Half Life 1. I then booted up HL2 for the first time(I got it gifted to me a while back but hadn't played it). Let me say, Half life hit so many great spots, and I feel confident saying that it was the most fun time I have had in a video game!!! I will soon be picking up episodes 1 and 2 and I am excited for what the series will bring. If you are on the rocks about buying Half Life 2, then I can advise you to purchase it, for less that  $10USD, you can buy a game that gives exciting, action filled entertainment. Also, if you are thinking about value for money, Half Life 2 give a long campaign (It took me 14 hours to beat blind)After playing Half Life 2, I can now fully understand the hype behind Mr Gordan Freeman!!!

												Like its predecessor, Half-Life 2 is a single-player first-person shooter broken into several chapters, permanently casting the player as the protagonist Gordon Freeman. The sequel has nearly the same mechanics as Half-Life, including health-and-weapon systems and periodic physics puzzles, except with the newer Source Engine and improved graphics. The player also starts without items, slowly building up an arsenal over the course of the game. Despite the game's mainly linear nature, much effort was put into making exploration rewarding and interesting; many optional areas can be missed or avoided.A diverse set of enemies is present, which usually require being approached with different tactics: some coordinate in groups to out-maneuver or out-position the player; others, like the Manhack, fly directly at the player through small openings and tight corridors; still others use predictable but powerful attacks, while others hide before swiftly attacking the player. Gordon can kill most enemies with his weapons, or make use of indirect means, exploiting environmental hazards such as explosive pressurized canisters, gas fires or improvised traps. For some portions of the game, Gordon can be joined by up to four armed Resistance soldiers and medics, and can send his team further from him or call them back.Many of the game's new features utilize its detailed physics simulation. Two sections of the game involve driving vehicles. Instead of button-based puzzles from Half-Life, environmental puzzles are also introduced with makeshift mechanical systems, revolving around the player's new ability to pick up, move, and place objects. Solutions involve objects' physical properties, such as shape, weight, and buoyancy. For example, in Chapter 3, Route Kanal, the player is required to stack cinder blocks on a makeshift see-saw ramp to proceed over a wall. Alternatively, the player can use these to build a crude staircase, so sometimes, multiple approaches lead to the desired outcome.Part-way through the game, Gordon acquires the Gravity Gun, which allows him to draw distant objects towards himself or forcefully push them away, as well as the ability to manipulate larger and heavier objects that he cannot manipulate without the weapon. These abilities are required to solve puzzles later in the game, and can also be used to great effect in combat, as any non-static object within proximity to the player has the potential to be used as a makeshift defense (e.g. a file cabinet) or a deadly projectile (e.g. a gasoline can or a buzzsaw blade).The game never separates the player with pre-rendered cutscenes or events; the story proceeds via exposition from other characters and in-world events, and ensures that the player controls Gordon for the entirety of the game. Much of the backstory to the game is simply alluded to, or told through the environment.			"

												You will do such things as robbing banks, running across streets with fast-moving traffic, go down warp pipes, get accosted by the ninja turtles and A-Team, steal the tardis, and team up with doctor Brown.That's just the first chapter.			"

												Half-Life 2 is the iconic science fiction FPS. You take the role of Gordon Freeman who joins resistance in dystopian Earth conquered by Combine empire (it has evil corporate feel). Explore City 17 and shoot some aliens, humans and monsters!The games is considered the best video game ever by some. It's definitely very, very, very good. Is it best? Everyone should play it for themselves. It's absolutely worth playing, that's for sure.PROS:- Even in 2017 I believe graphics is wonderful with splendid animation and beautifully made people.- Music is OK. When it's present, it fits the surroundings really well.- Map design and the general feel of locations is great.- Multitude and diversity of locations with various types of combat.- Gameplay physics is magnificent. In some places you have to use physics to progress.- Gameplay ranges from survival horror, through puzzle solving, to urban warfare. At all points it's quite fun.- One of weapons is gravity gun. One of most interesting weapons I've ever used in video games.- Narrative pacing is enjoyable.- Story is quite good. It's not very original. Standard future corporate dystopia. It has no plot holes and works just fine.- Gravity gun is so much fun. Ripping the electronics from the wall in final level - OMG, so much satisfaction :-)- Good voice acting.- You get to play with a huge harbor crane.- Sweet Lord, destroying all that monitors with gravity gun! FUN FUN FUN! :-)MEH:- It's linear. It's enjoyable, but it's linear.CONS:- None.Conclusion: must play. Full recommendation.GAMEPLAY 10/10GRAPHICS 10/10AUDIO 9/10STORY 8/10			"

												""November 2004 : Counter-Strike: Source and Half-Life 2 are officially released on PC around the world, bringing in a new era for the First Person Shooter genre of video game, with advanced graphics & physics."" -WikipediaYou'll end up admiring beautiful landscapes, killing hundreds of zombies or aliens that speak English, shooting a gunship with a gun mounted on an airboat, or with an RPG, sniping enemies with a crossbow, and even destroying a portal to another dimension. And all of this in the Source Engine, arguably the best game engine ever made (even my crappy laptop with a built-in graphics card can run it with 50 FPS with every setting maxed and I'm pretty sure a Raspberry Pi can run it as well).In my advice, Half-Life 2 should be considered as one of the best video game ever made. The storyline is epic and the gameplay is totally immersive and nearly o.r.g.a.s.m.i.c. Oh and btw, happy 10th birthday Half-Life 2!∞/10			"

												By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors -- even the emotions -- of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people -- people he cares about -- are counting on him.			"

												I have finally finished this game! It only took me 19 slow hours, all I can say is wow! Check out those damn graphics on a game from 2004! There's a crap ton of puzzles which are easy yet fun, and oh God Ravenholm is freaking badass! Nothing like some zombie action and scares here and there. As expected this game doesn't present any flaws on my end, I could sit here and type my full experience with it. That would take too long honestly, I can't wait to start playing the remaining 2 episodes :)10/10			"

												The legendary sequel, it does everything that the original Half-Life did, and even better.Zombies, hostile military, head crabs (absolutely ^nothing^ like face huggers), big bugs, aliens, weird new crazy creatures that I don't even know the name of.Lots of guns, and sci-fi guns, including a tool that turns anything of roughly human size and decent weight into a weapon (yes, kill zombies by projecting barrels and circular saws at them), and a ball of energy that you may or may not recognise from Portal.The most round about ways of getting from point A to point B.LazorzPhysics puzzles - now with even more physics!Surprise platforming! (now with even more surprises)The great crowbar of Gorden the Freeman!Infuriating technology! From levers to switches, to the classic button, Half-Life 2 introduces power cables and field generatorsHalf-Life 2 also brings you:Vehicles, such as the boat type thingy, and the car like buggy car... thing... All with full physics support!Story! I mean, yeah, Half-Life 1 had story, but only really right at the start and towards the end. But now, you get story throughout! With actual characters! Who really do have the ability to make you care about whether they live or not!Horror! Oh, yes, you'll appreciate it when it's over. Be sure to make full use of flares...and...Cliffhangers! (Both literal and, err, you know, normal)Considered by many to be the best first-person shooter of all time, Half-Life 2 is one you need to play, and should hold a high priority on your to play list at that. Higher. Higher. Lower. A little bit higher. Okay, you're good			"

												The best game I have ever played. Its fear of unknown atmosphere and fascinating story are on stellar quality levels. This game collects all the great things that matter in videogames and expands them to extremely high levels of polishment, epicness and pure awesomeness. The result is a perfect gameplay, perfect graphics, perfect audio, everything quite perfect, abundant in extreme quality which you will never forget. One of the greatest achievements of videogame industry. I don't know what to add. Even when I played this game for the sixth (or so) time, I had a wonderful time. Thanks to its perfectly utilized physics engine, the game has a believable world, that is overflowing with interactivity. The Gravity Gun is the best weapon/tool of all time. Every second modern game has some sort of physics interactions in it and maybe even a kind of telekinesis ability, but I have yet to witness such seamless implementation like the Gravity Gun of HL2. This game also possesses a unique soundtrack, that I always like to listen to. I will never forget the voice of the Overwatch.			"

												""Life is not complete until you play at least half of Half-Life 2.""Where do I start with this? Hmm. How about atmosphere?Atmosphere:It's amazing. Wherever you go it feels like it's real. That's my opinion, but yours can be different. Gameplay:It is hard. It is incredibly hard. I had to look up walkthroughs everyhour or so! I rage quited a few times and I felt so angry at the enemies! But what that did do was make the ending more rewarding. When I completed it I thought I was one of the many gods who beat it. The guns sound like...well.....guns. The guns act like real guns. Yeah.......guns.........Music:You need to hear the soundtrack. I dont care if your grandma turned into a potato. JUST HEAR THE SOUNDTRACK. THE MAIN THEME IS ALSO VALVE'S THEME. So whenever you start up a VALVE game you hear the starting of the theme. It's so wonderful to hear it. Why should I get this game?Why not, dingus?This game is overrated:That is true. Some people say it's the best game ever and will force it down your throat that it's the best. Even though it's a classic and one of the best. There never can be the BEST game. ""There is no best, only opinions""- Me.But I DO recommend it. Just do a favor for yourself and get the game and play it!Ending statements:If you're not buying the game and your reasons are not ""I dont have any steam wallet money,"" or ""I want another game really bad,"" then WHAT IS YOUR MAJOR MALFUNCTION?You havent lived as a gamer until you have played this game. Half Life 3 is the most hyped game of all time! And there's a reason for that! It's amazing and awesome and a classic and one of the best games of all time!GG and many time's I will reMake the right choice and buy this game! It will change your life if you play all the way through it and make a opinion about it. So whatcya waiting for? Hurry up and buy that game ya dingus!*Gaben voice* Thanks! And have fun!			"

												Half-Life 2 is a very diverse game. Though action-packed, you'll also have moments when you are forced to stop and think... what items do I need and how do I use them to get past this obstacle? Using machinery or sometimes by simply stacking up objects.In some areas you'll be able to drive in a buggy or hover boat with onboard alien weapons, accompanied by fast-paced music to get your heart pumping. You'll also have to cross some scary areas that you don't want to do just before going to bed.I love the controls in this game and there's a nice variety of weapons you can use. The story and the great gameplay makes you wanna keep on playing even after you've finished the game.You can have lots of hours of fun playing through the different difficulty modes. One of my most favorite games, definitely worth to try out!10/10			"

												""Rise and shine,Mr. Freeman,rise and shine""- G-manHalf-Life 2 is the sequel to Half-Life,the game by Valve that pretty much wrote the rules for FPSs way back in 1998.I haven't played very much of this game myself,but I can guarantee that anyone who plays it will end up loving this game,even those that didn't play HL1 before playing this game(like me). The plot: Gordon Freeman is brought out of stasis by the G-Man,who inserts him in a train arriving at the fictitous City 17,which was taken over by Combine forces.  He eludes the Combine forces and meets Alyx and Barney,and joins the Lambda Resistance.  He gets to Dr. Kleiner's lab and assists them in attempting to get a teleporter to teleport him and Alyx to Dr. Eli Vance's lab. The teleportation fails,and he goes through City 17 on foot to get to Eli's lab.  He arrives at Black Mesa East and meets up with Eli, where he is captured and taken to a combine prison,Nova Prospekt.  Gordon goes through a zombie infested town named Ravenholm and is given a Dune Buggy,which he uses to travel to Nova Prospekt.  Eli,Alyx,and Gordon escape,the combine teleporter they used exploding in the process.  Gordon and Alyx learn they were in a ""slow teleport""during which a week has passed. In their absence,the Resistance mobilized against the combine, turning City 17 into a battleground.  Alyx is captured by the Combine and taken to the Citadel,with Gordon,aided by Barney and D0g,goes to the Citadel.  He gets caught in a Combine""confiscation chamber"",which destroys all of his weapons except for the Gravity Gun,the energy enhancing it's capabilities and turning it into a superior weapon.  He is captured riding in a Combine transport pod and is taken to Dr. Breen's office,where he is holding Eli and Alyx captive.  Breen explains his plans for further conquest of the humans by the Combine.  Breen tries to escape through a portal,but Gordon destroys the portal reactor with the super-charged Gravity Gun. Breen is annihilated in the resulting explosion,but just before Gordon and Alyx get killed,time is frozen,and the G-Man appears,praising Gordon for his actions in City 17 and the Citadel,and puts Gordon back into stasis.  The characters are pretty cool,even if some of the characters can tend to be annoying*looks at Barney*The music is pretty cool,tho the game mostly relies on ambiance.The weapons are pretty good,just really your standard FPS weapons,except the Gravity Gun is added,which lets you move almost any object at will. Heck,you get a crowbar also x) :)This is an amazing game overall,it seriously deserves the critical acclaim that it's gotten,and I HIGHLY recommend this game,even to those that haven't played Half-Life before,it's def worth the 10 bucks10/10 from me :)			"

Basically, the Combine (An alien-race) have taken over Earth and essentially enslaved the population. You Morgan Freeman are basically the savior, and lead the rebellion for freedom. (Although trust me, there's a lot more to it)+ Very large open environments with a lot to explore.+ Variety of unique weapons with many that have an alternate fire ability. More importantly the ""Gravity Gun"" which you can use to pick up and launch objects at enemies is just so much fun!+ The Physics and Physics-Based Puzzles were fantastic, even for today's standards. The puzzles  just feel very satisfying and are not overly difficult to solve.+ Personally, the Airboat and Scout Car vehicle missions were a joy to play with a great sense of speed and freedom along with being very well thought out with some unique obstacles.+ Very challenging ""boss"" fights that come in many varieties. You take down helicopters, gunships, Antlion Guards, Striders, and so fourth that are all very exciting and thrilling.+ Ravenholm...a level with a dark eerie vibe infested with zombies. In my opinion, this level was amazing and probably inspired Left 4 Dead. This level was completely different from anything encountered before or after, and is truly a fantastic zombie-survival experience...with a comedic Russian companion to help you along. + For a FPS, Half Life 2 has A LOT of content. According to some surveys, the main story takes about 10-14hours. It took me about 9 hours going through pretty quicky, but I was left feeling completely satisfied.+ Fantastic soundtrack with many atmospheric pieces that really help emerse the player into the game world. + The controls felt great, making gunfights fun and skill-based.+ You get to control companions (including Antlion creatures) for a few missions which is quite enjoyable+ Although this game was made in 2004, I need to mention that the graphics still look good to this day.- I felt like some levels were overly drawn out or a bit too lengthy. Especially Nova Prospekt (The Prison). At some points it felt like I was just going through a very long maze filled with enemies. - The story is lacking in some aspects and can leave new players feeling a bit lost. For the majority of the game you are traveling alone for long periods and are told to go from place to place without a good explanation of what you are meant to be doing and why. Even at the end of the game, I couldn't help but wonder what was going on...~ Just a personal note, but I wish they included some sort of medium range rifle or burst-shot gun. You get pistols, shotgun, pistol, crossbow, and machine guns, but not much to precisely take out enemies from afar. I was also a bit curious as to why they did not give you a sniper rifle as the Combine are seen using them throughout the game.			"

												Half-Life 2 promises a lot with all the hype surrounding it, but fails to live up to its gargantuan expectations.  With that being said, it is still a fairly wonderful game.  The dystopian setting is extremely enjoyable, with levels of dry humor that keep you interested.  The game mechanics are similar to the rest of Valve's collection, so you know what to expect.  Quirky additions are what set the game apart--such as the gravity gun and vehicles.  Half-Life 2 is a game you have to play at least once in your life, but replay value isn't promising.			"

You get the entire series plus Portal, and it comes out cheaper. The Orange Bundle was on sale yesterday for $5 on greenmangaming. Its normally 20 dollars however, which is still a pretty good deal.

You will need to kill even more monsters in this game, that's not all...the most important thing is...you will need to use your ammo wisely and make every shots that you fired count...you will not get much ammo drop than the previous game. Why am I saying this?? The reason is because there are a number of times that I have almost used up every weapon's ammo. Recommended on getting this game when it goes on sale, you will not regret in getting this game. 10/10 for this massive improvement of the Half-Life game			"

												Half-Life 2, the game that like it's predecessor is seen as a classic. It's time for me to find out if the game still holds up. The story takes place some years after the events of the original Half-Life. Gordon Freeman is woken up by G-Man to find out that the world had been taken by the alien Combine. Gordon is then joined by resistance fighters to find a way to free humanity. The gameplay itself is a mixture of shooting, puzzle solving and exploration much like the first Half-Life game. However, all of this is differently executed in Half-Life 2. In Half-Life 2 everything is even more dynamic, because of objects being destructible and having physics, which can result in some memorable chain reactions. The world felt to me like a real open world game, while it is still a pretty linear game. This has to do with the fact that you are mostly outside and you can explore the different areas and interact with npcs. The world you play in is around the same city area, which means that this time you aren't going to other alien dimensions. When you think about it there aren't actually that many new things in Half-Life 2. But the things that are new still deliver new gameplay. For instance, the gravity gun that you get can grab and shoot objects which is great for murdering and puzzle solving. The gravity gun really adds a playfulness to the game. The other real new weapon is the bug bait which is a ball that you can throw on enemies or destinations, which will result in a group of your own aliens going to it and attacking the enemies. The only problem I had with this is that you can only use this weapon in a certain section.  The other new gameplay feature is that you can now drive a buggy at certain parts. I read people saying that it was the worst part of Half-Life 2. In my opinion even though the buggy feels clunky I loved that part the most. It really gives that open world explorer feeling, because of you have to get out of the vehicle to look around. The sounddesign in this game was also done by the same team as the one that worked on the original Half-Life. I can say that I liked this soundtrack even more than the previous one, because of it having more of its’ own style. The epic music sometimes felt a little off though, but they are still fun to listen to. The sound effects add a quirky feeling, and the voice acting is also professionaly executed. The storytelling of the game was mostly well executed, with also including storytelling through gameplay. Sadly, unlike in its’ predecessor, you are forced at certain parts to listen to conversations. This can be pretty annoying if you have to listen to it again, without the option to skip it. I have to say that overall the world, story and gameplay doesn't feel as flawlesly connected as it was in the previous Half-Life. That probably has to do with the fact that the game also wanted to show everything impressive that the engine could do. The game took me 12 hours to complete so it was shorter than the original Half-Life, but I guess that also has to do with the fact that at the beginning I unknowingly played on the easiest difficulty. Later I found out I could actually change it in the options menu. Even with the complaints I have with Half-Life 2 compared to Half-Life 1, I can still recommend it. The game like its’ predecessor was greatly ahead of its’ time, and at some parts maybe still is. While playing I realized that every futuristic game that I played that came out after Half-Life 2 all had big 'inspiration' from the game.  Half-Life 2 is still adventurous enough that it still holds up. Reviews of the other Half-Life games:Half-LifeHalf-Life: Opposing ForceHalf-Life: Blue Shift "

A perfect example of a game that never gets oldHalf-Life 2 is undoubtedly a dream dreamed fans of the series. Elaborated in detail, oppressive climate on many levels, from the science fiction thriller to horror in the style of Night of the Living Dead, long memorable. Valve Software work is a must read for any self-respecting player who appreciates not only the intensity of the game, but also its refinement. I get caught for hours, fueling the desire to have both additives, and after graduation to join the crowds at Valve seat, shouting: 'Release Episode Three!'. The game did not impress me in the slightest.			"

Half-Life 2 is an amazing game.Half-Life 2's level design is really good and does a good job at letting you be in a confined space but not letting you feel trapped. It feels authentic in a sense that, if you're in a specific level, you're trapped by actual walls or solid and visible objects; as opposed to invisible objects. Some would think that it might have invisible walls with a futuristic touch, like blue lines going through it, since it is a Sci-Fi game.Half-Life 2 also does an excellent job and making you feel scared. There is one level, Ravenholm, it is absolutely filled with zombies, it is a very dark and eerie level. I remember, the entire time I was playing through it, I was extremely terrified, but had to power through. It was hard.Half-Life 2's combat is pretty spot on, almost no errors anywhere with hitboxes being fine and no noticeable or game-breaking bugs. The game also has a variety of weapons.Half-Life 2 lets you drive 2 vehicles in the game, one of which is a Jeep, it is a very fast land-vehicle. It is mildly difficult to control while at high speeds, which isn't a bad thing, it's to be expected. The Airboat is a fast land and water vehicle which is noticeably difficult to control, at almost any time. The game has a good sue of vehicles in specific levels.Half-Life 2's soundtrack and sounds do sound very modern. The soundtrack is extremely good, and chooses what to play at specific times, but even so, the music it does actually play is very good. Even now, while writing this review, I am listening to part of the soundtrack, Triage at Dawn, it is called. A very, very nice part of the soundtrack. The sounds, even crowbarring a toilet or a wall, do sound very real.The game, I should talk about, doesn't, for me, at least, do an excellent job at keeping you hooked, it took me a while in between play-sessions to get back into it. But I very recently finished it.This all makes out to be a very pleasant gaming experience, and it is highly recommended as a game.91/100 "

												Let's get this out of the way: the Source engine is showing its age – later Valve games have incorporated upgrades that are lacking in Half-Life 2. There isn’t much detail compared to more recent games, textures are blurry, and there are problems with lighting and shadows. All of that is true, but it really isn’t fair to criticize the game for that…it was made in 2004, and it looks like it was, but that doesn’t take away from how fun it is to play. And besides, if you’re really concerned about the graphics, you can always download one of the free community mods (Half-Life 2: Update for example) which make it look prettier.On to my thoughts on the gameplay. I think the reason Half-Life 2 was (and still is) so successful is because the gameplay constantly evolves as you progress forward. As soon as you become comfortable, you’re presented with something which changes how you can approach each situation. After playing the beginning – which feels like a fairly standard shooter – you’re given the airboat and giant arenas to play around with. After a while of that, they give you a machine gun on the airboat, changing up how you use it. Then you’re given the gravity gun, and immediately thrust into Ravenholm, a haunting and creepy environment filled with saw blades, barrels, and other things you can throw at enemies. Then comes the dune buggy and ant-lions, and some of my favorite sections of the game. Traveling down Highway 17, dodging ant-lions as you ferret out combine strongholds on the coast, showcases some of the best that Half-Life 2 has to offer.But the game isn’t done throwing new things at you. After fighting the ant-lions, you’re given a tool which makes them your allies, and you use them to assault Nova Prospekt, a claustrophobic prison where you’re given access to automated turrets and have to stand your ground against waves of Combine soldiers. Once you’ve escaped Nova Prospekt, you’re thrown into a full-blown rebellion and given command of a squad of resistance fighters. And then finally, at the end of the game, all of your weapons are taken away except for a super-powered gravity gun, and you get to experience what it’s like to throw men around like rag dolls as you rampage through the citadel.Not all of these are executed perfectly – the squad command sections in particular hilariously showcase the shortcomings of the AI, with companions constantly getting in your way, running out to die from snipers or grenades, and generally acting like morons. Some of the pacing, particularly at the beginning of the game as you run through sewer after sewer and later as you crawl through Nova Prospekt, is tedious and repetitive. But it’s worth playing through those sections to see what comes next, because there’s always something new around the corner.Half-Life 2 still does a far better job than most recent games in shifting the game’s paradigm constantly, and that evolving gameplay makes it successful – and fun to play over a decade later. If it’s been a while since you played it, it’s worth it to revisit it. If you’ve never played it before, it won’t wow you with its looks, but you’ll experience a classic with some of the best gameplay around – and widely considered one of the best games ever made.View the full review here[www.thesewall.com].

												It'll be the 10 year anniversary for this game later on this year.Just thought I'd mention it.9/10.test of timeThe game is really good though, great visuals, unique story, and fun gameplay. The game includes Source SDK, which is needed for (at least some) of the Half-Life 2 mods (e. g. Synergy). Overall, I think it's great game, and has stood up pretty well over the years, and once you're done with this, go ahead and get the other two episoooooodes. Yaaaaaaaay. After that, you can wait until Half-Life 3 comes out!			"

												I played through Half-Life 2 a couple years ago and loved every minute of it. I can't really say anything new that someone didn't already say. This game is amazing- the gameplay, the atmosphere, the things you interact with is just awesome. One of the best FPS games ever made. If you haven't played Half-Life 2 you really need to buy it and play it. Also buy Half-Life: Episode One and Half-Life: Episode Two. 10/10			"

												Half-Life 2 is one of those games that everyone has, but not everyone has played. I still get surprised whenever I come across someone who spends a lot of time playing games, but hasn't finished (or even played) Half-Life 2.The story telling in this game is fantastic. The story, characters and levels are well developed and it's clear just how much time went into making the game. I love all the detail put into level design, character development and design, and voice acting.Some people think the graphics are a little dated, which is true. It's a game from 2004. But if anything, I think it adds to the feel of the game. Additionally, what game will never have it's graphics dated? Technology changes people, gosh.If you have Half-Life 2 in your steam library but haven't yet played or are yet to acquire a copy, I strongly recommend giving it a shot. You won't regret it. You'd better be quick though, you'd want to finish it before Half-Life 3 is released!And of course you've gotta love some ABHing, wall climbing and grenade jumping while speedrunning!Super highly recommended!Happy Life Halving!

												This is one of the few games where you can believe the hype and not be let down in the slightest.  I had been told for YEARS how much of an experience this was but never gave it a shot... Until now.  My mind was blown from the first few minutes and onward it just got better & better.  A true classic in every way.  From the intensely immersive gameplay to the atmospheric and captivating world - Half Life 2 brings you into City 17 and renders it in a way that feels tangible.  Often times I found myself speaking for Gordon only to realize I was just muttering in sheer awe of the technical marvels presented for the time.  I can see roots of modern games like Last of Us and Bioshock Infinite and how they stemmed from this masterpiece.  10/10, 5 stars, two thumbs up and all of the praise I can give.  Valve needs to put out Half-Life 3 or work on another game similar to this as I know that I would pre-order it instantly.  What a genre bending adventure, worth every penny and every minute!			"

												After reading several reviews of this game, I decided to give it a try. This is how my game has gone thus far:Day 1: Downloading was quick and painless, it ran smoothly from the very first time I opened it. Usually, I don't really like FPS, but this has grown on me. I loved how the story progressed as I explored the scenes.Day 2: (Impressed) This story progression is pretty amazing, I love that there was so much attention to detail and it was also my first time using a vehicle \:D/ Day 3: (More impressed) The evolution of the enemies you fight is brilliant and I loved the range of weapons I got to choose from.Day 4: (In love) The doors are invulnerable. The ooze is radioactive. I can use any weapon I want (including paint tins- which can explode on contact). I've had a jeep. I've had minions. More general badassery ensues. Day 5: (Happily married) Everyone should play this game. At least once.  "

												Half-Life 2 is a first-person shooter game from Valve. It is a sequel to the previous game, Half-Life.The game focus on storyline set after the event of Half-Life, in a City 17 somewhere in Eastern Europe. You play as Gordon Freeman, the protagonist from Half-Life and embark on a new journey as he return from G-man stasis. The world that he once knew has changed, the Combine has taken over. Now he must struggle along with his fellow human resistance for survival.Using the new Source Engine, Half-Life 2 has remarkable graphics and far better than the previous Half-Life game. The new physics are incredible, almost everything is moveable. Textures and effects are also even more beautiful. The best graphics of the time.It's a good classic first-person shooter game with the best story, I recommend this.Rating 10/10			"

												So, I'm one of those guys who has played console games all of his life. I can be very lethal with a controller in hand. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said with a mouse and keyboard. To remedy this disparity, I figured I'd re-enter the world of arguably the most famous PC games of all time... Half-Life 2.I played this game back when it was packaged in ""The Orange Box"" for the Xbox 360. It was definitely enjoyable back then, and there is very little drop off over the years. Sure, the graphics aren't up to par with modern-day games, but they hold up a lot better than the original Half-Life. The gameplay is very fluid. I found the machine gun and shotgun to be my two most used weapons outside of the gravity gun. I used the machine gun regularly throughout the entire game, and it excelled in medium-range combat. However, it had nothing over the shotgun in close-range scenarios. There were many times in which the shotgun kept me safe when I was caught off guard.Speaking of getting caught off guard, this game had plenty of moments that startled me or made me jump from my seat. I mean, I've beaten this game over a decade ago. Yet, I seem to have forgetton how great this game is. The little instances in which some headcrab or other enemy popped up from around the corner or from some dark location scared me more than any other ""Horror"" movie or game has, ever! The environments are well-thought out. There are plenty of objects to interact with, and there are forty-five health caches scattered throughout the game for those who wish to explore every nook and cranny that this game has to offer. The entire story is presented while you control the protagonist, Gordon Freeman. There are no cutscenes. Instead, you can walk around and pay as much (or as little) attention that you'd like to the dialogue. Consequently, I found myself more enthralled by the events that took place. I lived in this world, and I cared about what happened.I'm sure that most people reading this review have already beaten this game, and that's fine. This game has been around for a while. That being said, this classic game deserves to be played again. It may not have the most memorable story, but it has some memorable set-pieces, and the enemies can be challenging at higher difficulties. Simply put, Half-Life 2 is a complete game that ages like fine wine. I appreciate this game a lot more now than I did over ten years ago. So will you.			"

												A classic staple for anyone wanting a good FPS game to get started with on Steam.My favorite part was when the combine decided it was a great idea to still charge at me in the dozens despite watching me having just gone through most of their forces like a kitten catching and eating a mouse. Needless to say, many laughs were had all around as they Combine seemed to have no issue with the losses and kept on going.Meanwhile, most people standing aside Gordon were dumb enough to usually stand in his way and became meat shields, only for more to join and continue to do what they do best, stand in the way and try to reassure Gordon he has ""no reason to worry."" Five seconds later they are down for the count, Gordon, Alyx, and Eli move on.The game has many fun things all around, shotguns, gravity guns, rockets, grenades, crowbars, shotguns, antlion minions, magnums, crossbows, shotguns, allies dying beside you by being complete idiots. Oh, did I mention shotguns yet?9.5/10 - Great Comedy FPS, would play again for the comedic value that Gordon's allies provide.			"

												oh Half-life 2... if i can compare it to a real life situation imma say when you like after divorcing your first wife, ...yeah it was a hard divorce but still it was meant to happen, and right now you are with your second wife, she is very beautiful you never imagined that you can have this majestic creature as a wife but as i said same with hl2 no matter how much time you play with it, how much a good time you spent with your wife you will unfortunately get bored so you are dreaming of a third one but you know deep down inside you that you can't have a third wife..., yeah sure the divorce worked with the first one but the 2nd wife is your last chance cuz you know you grow older and you wont have another more beautiful wife than this one so you keep dreaming of a much beautiful and much younger woman but when you wake up it'll all go away, so you keep praying to our lord and saviour daily to fulfill your wish, your dream but he never listen to us, all what he does after all this years of waiting with doubts is an AMA on reddit and respons to some questions with salty respons and leaves you without any real respond no comfirmation at all, why lord Gaben WHY...we..i just want Half-life 3 :'(anyways one of the best games 10/10 would divorce again			"

												Half-Life in 1998 changed the FPS genre forever with its storytelling technique and graphics.  Half-Life 2 set the standard once again.  A perfect sequel to the original game that is still a blast to play.  Half-Life 2 offers great graphics, great sound, great action and pacing of the action, great storytelling and possibly still one the greatest 1984 like atmospheres ever created.  This is a lengthy game and well worth every minute.  A good variety of enemies, NPCs, sceneries and vehicles to ride.  This is still the game that all games should be compared to.			"

												John Freeman walked like speed of light back to his motorcycl and left behind the bad place behind him. John Freeman had to ride his motorcycle really fast back to the office but John Freemans gas ran out. John Freeman jumped fast off the motorcycle and landed on dead peoples hands.""Gordon Freeman is now these hands... i must kill the next boss and live up to full-life consequences!"" John Freeman said out loud.John Freeman picked up a laser gun and aimed it at trees to see if he could. John Freeman shot and tree fell down in front of him. John Freeman seen eggs fall out of the tree and he put them back home safe.""These birds dont have to see Gordon Freeman yet. its not time."" John Freeman said to him.John Freeman had to walked faster and was back at his office work and on a computer. He looked on the internet and found the next boss.""I know his weakness now"" John Freeman said. And after that he got emails from someone. John Freeman opened up the emails and read them.""Dear John Freeman, how are you? I miss you at home come home safe and soon with Gordon Freeman for thanksgiving dinner. Love mom."" John Freeman looked at it and got sad and yelled ""I WILL KILL THE BOSS AND GORDON FREEMAN WILL BE HAPPY SOUL!"" then he turned on off the computer and wet on the platform again down to his other more faster motorcycle that had gas in it this time.John Freeman put the laser gun on his motorcycle and his machine gun and his rocket gun that he found on the side of the motorcycle. He went through traffic and went fast like litning to back to Ravenholm and back to the bad place where Gordon Freeman was. John Freeman went off road and did backflips and landed on back wheels but kept going too.John Freeman went really fast again like before and was soon back again at Ravenholm but saw more zombie goasts. John Freeman said to them ""Zombie goasts i have killed your friends at the old house and i dont want to shoot your heads. move near the countrysides and you will be friends of John Freeman."" The zombie goasts said that ""no we will kill you"" and walked fast to John Freemans motorcycle. John Freeman waited until they were in front of his motorcycle and backflipped off his bars and shot heads below and landed and walked fast to where the next boss was.""you will be one of us!"" yelled the dead zombie goasts. John Freeman laughed and shot a rocket at them.John Freeman saw the next boss far down the road and walked slow this time. He walked really slow like a turtle and sat down on a rock and watched the next boss near the dead last boss and where the place that Gordon Freeman was. The next boss was laughing at John Freeman so John Freeman said ""YOU WILL NOT LAUGH AT ME!"" and shot a rocket at him since that was his weakness.The next boss died and John Freeman was happy. He walked over to the dead bosses and put them under the ground and planted pants on them so instead of messy dirt and dark there was pretty things there now to be happy.John Freeman walked to where Gordon Freeman was lying dead and crushed from the next bosss feet and looked down. A tear droped out of John Freemans eye and landed on Gordon Freeman.""You are dead bro and i killed the evil boss."" John Freeman told Gordon FreemanThen John Freeman saw something bad. A headcrab was on Gordon Freeman! Gordon Freeman standed up and said ""John Freeman... you got here slow and now i am zombie goast. you will pay...""to be continued...? "

												HL2 is one of the best games of all time.over 12milion copies soled.Gordon Freeman(protagonist) starts in City 17 and Wallace Breen(antagonist) talking some ♥♥♥♥.Later you find Barney,Dr.Klainer,Alyx and Eli Vance and go on a adventure (i mean only you for the most part).the game is a must have evrything is done perfectly even if they had been hacked.The only thing thats minus for me is that the original HL2 would be more good if they Hadn't been hacked.i give it a score of 95/100.A really must have game,and dont forget if you want to know about the whole history of the HL series first to play HL before HL2!

												I think Half Life 2 is a great first person shooter from 2004, with a 9-10 hour single player campaign. There are a wide variety of weapons to use, along with well hidden lambda caches to find and use to your advantege as you battle through City 17 and through the outskirts. However, I don't think Half Life 2 is as amazing as most people claim it to be. ""10/10. 11/10. Best game ever!"" It kinda makes me laugh... With Half Life 2 being a very solid shooter. I find It difficult to follow the story, or figure out why these events in the game are happening; It feeels like it's out of nowhere. For example: The Combine. They are not in the original Half Life. All that's explained is they are this Inter dimensional organization That wants to enslave Humanity, and you have to fight them. Sequel bait endings are the least of satisfying endings ever, and this game has that.I rate Half Life 2 with a solid 8/10. When this game goes on sale, definitely pick it up. I got the Half Life Collection for about $5.00That's my review for Half Life 2 and I will see you on the next one.     Let's form up! ~Stealth 1548			"

												Half Life 2 was released in 2004, 6 years after the first one. As i said in my Half Life review, the game revolutionized the FPS genre.https://steamcommunity.com/id/daniel_faraday/recommended/70/It was among the first games to add narrative to its game. To account for the change, it also made the level design very linear. Previously, FPS games would have a very maze like level design.Half Life 2's budget consisted of $40,000,000. I am not sure how much time and money was spent on the source engine itself, but from the development timeline, it seems that source engine was developed from the very 1999, shortly after release of HL1. Why do i want to emphasize of the source engine so much? Well, the main goal of the source engine was to provided realistic physics and facial animations.StoryIn the first game a portal opens up from a planet named Xen. You end up destroying the Queen, thus braking the portal link and ending up in captivity of Gman. The events of Half Life 2 happen 20 years after Half Life 1, somewhere in a eastern Europe town called City 17. Human race got enslaved by Combine, an alien race that was in war with Xen, which got interested in Earth after the events of Half Life 1. Gman decides to send you to City 17 to help the resistance.The realistic facial animations, and graphics in general that source engine provided really add up to the experience. The character really come to life thanks to those facial animations.The faces looked very real unlike say, Max Payne. It really took some time for that technology to appear in mainstream games. Sure, by 2004 there were plenty amount of games that would have a very narrative focus, like Fahrenheit (2005) for PS2. But just imagine how much more immersive it would look if it actually tried to focus on facial animations. Half Life 2 had one of the best facial animation techniques, until LA Noire came out. That game used motion capture.I also felt satisfied with the level the game provided. A zombie town for example. Or a land with arachnid creatures popping out of the sand. The boat chase. Or the one where you have to use the crane to get you car to the other side of the gate. Finally, there is a final chapter with a gravity gun.GameplayHalf Life 2 was the first game to feature physics. Because of that it allowed them to explore new horizons.The game would give the player a gravity gun, which allows you to use objects from the environment to your advantage. You can pick up sharp objects and cut enemies in half with them, or use explosive barrels to lite them up, or simply smash them with something heavy, or even something like tossing back a grenade.There are also new enemy types. New head crabs types were added. They also decided to improve on the zombies aspect of the game and even added a variety of zombie types to the game. There are also arachnid creatures, sort of like ones from Starship Troopers. At one point in the game, you will be able to control them.When you are not fighting these guys, you will be fighting the Combine, who use guns. At times you will also be fighting striders, which are 3 legged machines, sort of like the ones from War of the Worlds. Finally, sometimes you will also be fighting small flying drones. Due to their size, you can actually use the gravity gun. They are also sharp, so you can even cut with them.Thankfully, they decided to dial back on the amount of platforming in this game, though the game had puzzles added, mostly physics related.The game has a total 13 chapters, which is about 15 hours of gameplay.Additionally, it also provides a huge mod library. A lot of my favorites came about by being mods of HL2. Games like Chivalry, Natural Selection, Stanley Parable, Insurgency.			"

												Taking place in and around City 17 sometime in the near future, Half-Life 2 follows the scientist Gordon Freeman. Gordon Freeman is thrust into an unfamiliar environment in which the aftermath of the Black Mesa Incident has come to bear fully upon human society. Freeman is forced to battle against increasingly unfavorable odds in order to free Mankind from the Combine. In his struggle, he is joined by various allies, including fellow scientists, rebels, and friends (such as Alyx Vance) - all shocked to see him alive.			"

												Just amazing. This has to be one of the greatest games of 2004 and maybe even one of the best of the decade and that's why I would give this a 10/10. The level designs are certainly nowhere near linear, and the combat feels just swell. The characters and the voice acting can't seem to make me yawn or flinch a bit and I can't seem to stop playing every little second of the way. The only issue I have with this game are the friendly AI helpers. They just seem to get in the way and it might get you killed and it will bother anyone. Another extremely minor issue that won't bother anyone is that I think that Canals carrys on for too damn long. Still a great game and I always tell dog when whenever to wake up ""Rise and Shine, mister Freeman!"". Now that is some major awesomeness you got right there.			"

Taking place some time in the future, Gorden must navigate his way though a drastically changed world, encountering old friends and foe's alike. Supplied with a varied array of weaponry and access to mission-critical mounts like the modified buggy, Half-Life 2 offers new challenges and hidden secrets to satisfy lovers of the series.

												This is the source game engine. This game was the bomb when it came out in 2004 and it is still known as one of the best FPS games on the market but this game has a huge bit of history behind it when Valve finished Half-Life 1 they wanted to make a sequel right away but in 2003 after the E3 showcase of the game an ANON German hacker had leaked the files onto the internet and at the time the game was virtually unplayable.

												I bought HL2 on release day. Having played Half Life, I really wanted to give it's sequal a good run through. When I started my first game(all those years ago), I was stunned by the graphix valvE had incorporated into it. Visually, it was stunning!The gameplay was good. Good ol' Gordon Freeman returns to a world vastly different than he left at the end of Half Life. Your goal? To be the right man in the wrong place, as you can make all the diff---erence in the world. Even by todays standards, HL2 is a work of art visually speaking. I've played it through several times, and never get bored with it. "

This game was the bomb when it came out in 2004 and it is still known as one of the best FPS games on the market but this game has a huge bit of history behind it when Valve finished Half-Life 1 they wanted to make a sequel right away but in 2003 after the E3 showcase of the game an ANON German hacker had leaked the files onto the internet and at the time the game was virtually unplayable.

												After many years I finally completed HL2 and its expansions, and really, it's a game that stands out in the FPS genre.The gameplay is fluid and dynamic, has a satisfactory pace that keeps you stuck to the game and can dose the action sequences with parts that you should play more cautiously, exploring the environment. The AI is a strong point, and although there is little variety of enemies, you don't have a repetitiveness feeling while playing. The Source Engine needs no comments, even after almost 10 years of launching the graphics and physics effects are still convincing. The sound effects are also great.It's in the plot that the game stands out even more, the story is great and is able to keep you immersed in the storyline like few games can, there is a good dose of mystery about some events and some of the most epic and charismatic characters. Gordon Freeman is arguably the most badass and emblematic protagonist of the gaming world, without even saying a single word. The secondary characters are also well-built and charismatic.I highly recommend for those who haven't played. In case of not having played the first and its expansions, is good to seek a source with information about the events prior to this title.9/10			"

												In the spirit of it's predecessor, Half-Life 2 was a groundbreaking FPS at the time it was released.  Most notably was it's use of in-game physics.  Many objects (including enemies) can be used to solve various puzzles and used as weapons throughout this experience.  The actual story is somewhat of an enigma, but the path you are driven to follow and the characters you meet along the way make journey enjoyable nonetheless.  I never experienced the feeling that I was killing enemies simply because I had to progress or the play becoming monotonous.  Each chapter, and indeed the many parts of thereof, was composed of a variety of challenges that were easy enough to pick up but not always as easy to execute.  The only con I can come up with is the squad you get at a point in the game and their inability to stay out of your way at times (especially in narrow hallways D:).    This fast-paced shooter belongs in every action gamer's library. Bravo Valve!			"

Other shooters may surpass it in some ways, but Half-Life 2 is the most meticulously crafted FPS campaign I've ever played.

(don't worry, you'll figure out). Last but not least, the story and the audio are amazing. You should quit gaming if you didn't play Half-Life.			"

												This is the classic Valve first person shooter single person campaign.  If you buy one game on Steam, this and the Half Life 2 episodes should be it.The classic story of Gordon Freeman. Exploreable environments and useable / moveable objects, voiceover actors with alternate conversations. Is linear but you can explore alittle of each map.  Autosave works good.  Has a great story. Has Steam achievements and badge cards. It may be old, but still very good.And there are plenty of interesting free Modded games that require Half-Life 2 on Steam.for more info:

It has beautiful views, places and every single detail is incredible for a 2004 game ... and how did they made those graphics in 2004 ?! It´s just beautiful! The game had never crashed or bugged, it works very well in my laptop, and I don´t have a Gaming PC. The action is very exciting, I was never bored playing this game. From rooftop chases and helicopter chases with a futuristic jetski and incredible and creative guns, Half-Life 2 will always be a great game.			"

												Ho rigiocato HL2 dopo 10 anni. Ho impiegato 4 giorni a finirlo, contro il mese impiegato 10 anni fa. Questo mi rassicura non poco riguardo alla mia memoria e capacità di apprendimento, evidentemente non ancora del tutto devastate dall'età... Il gioco si presenta ancora molto bene, e quando si inizia è difficile smettere (un po' come con le sigarette). Certo lo stupore provato la prima volta, per la grafica, la fisica e il gameplay oggi non c'è più, ma il divertimento è comunque ancora assicurato. I percorsi obbligati, gli enigmi mai troppo complicati e le ottime possibilità di salvataggio rendono il gioco sempre scorrevole e mai frustrante. L'HDR ha reso la grafica ancora più realistica (per un gioco di 10 anni fa, ovviamente). Un po' lenti i caricamenti, e i salvataggi  causano spesso momentanei inceppamenti, particolarmente fastidiosi a livello audio. Resta in ogni caso un gioco fondamentale, una vera pietra miliare da non perdere assolutamente.I replayed HL2 after 10 years. It took me four days to finish it, against the month took 10 years ago. That reassures me more than a little about my memory and learning ability, apparently not yet completely devastated by age ... The game is still very good, and when you start it is hard to stop (a bit like with cigarettes). Certainly the astonishment felt the first time, for graphics, physics and gameplay today is no more, but the fun is still yet assured. The obligatory paths, the puzzles never too complicated and very good chances of saving make the game always smooth and never frustrating. The HDR made even more realistic graphics (for a ten years old game, of course). A little slow the loadings, and saving often produced momentary jamming, particularly annoying to hear.It is in any case a crucial game, a milestone not to be missed.			"

												I am your college professor that you requested, with a doctorate in Mathematics. I will break this down as simply as possible and end this debate as approx. 10 students have already asked me this today. The problem as it is written is 6÷2(1+2) , the ÷ cannot be substituted with a fraction bar because they have different ranks on the order of operations. It is an illegal math move to do this. The bar ranks with parentheses, ÷ is interchangeable with *. therefore the problem must be solved as 6÷2(1+2) NOT 6 (over) 2(1+2) we do the parentheses first, so 6÷2(3), the parentheses are now no longer relevant, because the number inside is in it's simplest form. Every single number has implied parentheses around it. 6÷2(3) (6) ÷(2)(3) 6÷2*3, or even converting the division to multiplication by a reciprocal (a legal math move) (6)(1 (over) 2)(3) are all correct ways to write this problem and mean exactly the same thing. Using pemdas, where md and as are interchangeable, we work from left to right, so (3)(3) or 3*3= 9 Just because something is implied rather than written does not give it any special rank in the order of operations.The problem in it's simplest form, with nothing implied would look like this: (1+1+1+1+1+1 (over) 1) ÷ (1+1 (over) 1) * ((1(over) 1) + (1+1 (over) 1)) From here, nothing is implied, This again, works out to 9. If the symbol '/' was used this whole debate would be ambiguous since that symbol can mean ""to divide by"" or it could mean a fraction bar. HOWEVER, because the ÷ symbol is used, it can not be changed to mean a fraction bar because that would change the order of operations and thus the whole problem, you can't change a symbol to mean something because you want to, in doing so you are changing the problem. Once and for all, the answer is 9. But 9-6=3 thereforeHalf-Life 3 confirmed			"

John Freeman got on his motorcycl and said ""its time for me to live up to my family name and face full life consequences"" so he had to go.John Freeman ramped off the building and did a backflip and landed. He kept driving down the road and made sure there was no zombies around because he ddint have weapon.The contrysides were nice and the plants were singing and the birds and the sun was almost down from the top of the sky. the mood was set for John Freemans quest to help his brother where he was. John Freeman looked around the countrysides and said ""its a good day to do what has to be done by me and help my brother to defeat the enemys"".John Freeman was late so he had to drive really fast. A cop car was hiden near by so when John Freeman went by the cops came and wanted to give him a ticket. Here John Freeman saw the first monster because the cop was posessed and had headcrabs.""I cant give you my lisense officer"" John Freeman said""Why not?"" said the headcrab oficer back to John Freeman.""Because you are headcrab zombie"" so John Freeman shot the oficer in the head and drove off thinking ""my brother is in trouble there"" and went faster.John Freeman had to go faster like the speed of sound and got there fast because Gordon needed him where he was. John Freeman looked at road signs and saw ""Ravenholm"" with someons writing under it saying ""u shudnt come here"" so John Freeman almost turned around but heard screaming like Gordon so he went faster again.John Freeman drove in and did another flip n jumped off his motorbike and the motor bike took out some headcrab zombies infront of John Freeman. John Freeman smiled and walked fast. John Freeman then looked on the ground and found wepon so he pickd it up and fired fast at zombie goasts in front of a house.John Freeman said ""Zombie goasts leave this place"" and the zombie goasts said ""but this is our house"" and John Freeman felt sorry for them becaus they couldnt live there anymore because they were zombie goasts so he blew up the house and killed the zombie goasts so they were at piece.Then John Freeman herd another scream from his brother so he kept walking really faster to get where he was. Ravenholdm was nothing like the countrysides there was no birds singing and the pants were dead and teh dirt was messy and bloody from headcrabs.When John Freeman got to where the screaming was started from he found his brother Gorden Freeman fightin the final bosss and Gordon said ""John Freeman! Over here!"" so John Freeman went there to where Gordon Freeman was fighting. John Freeman fired his bullet from teh gun really fast and the bullets went and shot the final boss in the eyes and the final boss couldnt see.Gordon Freeman said ""its time to end this ones and for all!"" and punched the final boss in the face and the final boss fell. John Freeman said ""thanks i could help, bro"" and Gordon Freeman said ""you should come here earlier next time"" and they laughed.The laughed overed quickly though because John Freeman yelled ""LOOK OUT BRO!"" and pointed up to the top of the sky. Gordon Freeman looked up and said ""NOO! John Freeman run out of here fast as you can!"" and John Freeman walked real fast out.John Freeman loked back and saw Gordon get steppd on by the next boss and he was mad and angry.""I'll get you back evil boss!"" John Freeman yelled at the top of lungs.to be continued..?			"

												Why are you reading the reviews? Why haven't you purchased this yet? Jokes aside, oh man, I can't express how much enjoyment I get when I play this game. Ultimately, this is my favorite game out of all the games I own.I owe it to one of my Steam friends who generously purchased the Half Life pack for me (while it was on sale too), for me so I could play Half Life. Out of all the Chapter's, Welcome To Ravenholm was the one I played the most, yet it's hilarious too because I HATE this chapter because I get scared way too easily. Yet the suspense when going through the town and being surprised by zombies or headcrabs, it's kinda hard to not hate this part of the entire game. Zappy's, as I call 'em, are now on the good side, and I'm glad because they shocked my ♥♥♥ too much in Half Life 1 lol. Damn Zappy's, why you gotta shock my butt so much? Another thing about the enemies/protagonists was the weapons you could use when you killed a Combine Soldier. 3OP5me. Overall, this is one of my favorites, I can play this so many times, but I wouldn't get tired of playing it no matter what. So stop wasting time reading this and buy this game!			"

												I recently finished this game, after playing the first one and the expansion packs. I already called Half-Life 1 one of the best games i've ever played, but this one is my all-time favourite.The game is not even nearly perfect, it is perfect. It's action packed, it got GREAT graphics, animations and more for a game from 2004 and it even got moments which were truly epic.Unlike the first one, this one offers more puzzles, greater and more evoirments and more action and even a little bit of horror in it. You not only fight against one enemy, no you get to fight headcrabs, helicopters, City 17 Guards, zombies and more. You kill them on your own creative way around the middle of the game when you get more weapons like the Gravity gun, one of my favourites. It let you travel to so many cool area's and not only on foot.. You get to travel to there with for example a car. Absolutly amazing. It's one of the few games of 2004 that offered so many beatiful content and realistic fighting. For example, around the end of the game, you get to control rebels against City 17, they help you, and give you health if needed. Sure, it got it's bugs, sometimes it also brought me motion sickness.. But that didin't stopped me from playing it.The ending and the mysterious G-Man makes me wanna' play Episode 1, which i surely will. It's only 9 bucks, so if you want to spent that money on a epic journey with enough replay valaue, then go ahead. Buy this game, a game which i think, never gets old and always will stay one of a kind.Great job Valve, this is one of your games to be proud of. "

												The Half-Life series is my all time favorite game trilogy. Sure, the graphics may not be the best ones out there, but it was huge for its time. This makes Half-Life look generally good while being able to run extriemely well with zero major framerate drops; completely smooth framerate. If you don't like the graphics, than you have to give credit to the storyline. Half-Life's story is one of the most gripping game storylines that I've seen. If you get Half-Life 2, Half-Life 1 is a must have. Unless you did some major reading about the first game before playing Half-Life 2, you most likely won't know whats going on. All in all, I COMPLETELY recommend getting this game, along with its episodes and Half-Life 1.			"

												An amazing game, a must buy, a must play, if you have enough money to buy it then just buy it now.Best way to buy it is through the Orange Box, not just do you get Half-LIfe 2 but also Episode One and Two, plus portal.An action packed game with great moments such as entering the Citadel and getting the Super-Charged Zero Point Energy Field Manipulator, or dashing through Ravenholm. Earth in this time of story has been taken over by Combine forces, but Half-Life isn't one to tell you the story uphand, that can be found with uncovering the deeper story. No time for cut-scences, well there aren't any but that's okay as it keeps you being the Gordon Freeman, it realy does imerse you in the game. Not just comat based based but also Physics too, with some here and there small Physcis puzzles. Later in the game as you progress, gather more weapons and more harder Combine enemies hunt you down you can take control of Antlion insects (something that was once an anoying enemy) and members of the Resistance (People like you who are trying take back Earth and their lives).Throwing and shooting explosive barrels is aways fun.Weapons of Crowbar and Gravity Gun, Glock and Magnum, SMG and Pulse Riffle (both have alt shots), Shotgun and Crossbow, and Grenades and RPG.There are two veichles in which you'll encounter in the game, the Boat and Buggy, personally I never liked the Boat and Water Hazard is one of my least liked chapters in the game, but the Buggy is pretty cool.There are boss battles (if you would call them that) from Hunter-Choppers, Gunships, Striders and Antlion Guards. Over coming these challanges is always an amazing thrill. Each place is always destinctively different and fun.The main problem I have with this game is that even with all this action, a lot of it at times felt a bit samey, but that is dealt with costant upgrade of tools and weapons. Another fault with the game (Both are fixed in Episode One and Two) is that you never seem to stay in one place, always constantly moving from a-b and no c, even though places are memerable.An amazing classic game and experience, with a rich story and lore. I loved it, if this is your first FPS (doesn't count only online ie. Counter Strike or TF2) then thats okay too as it was my first one, more amazingness then flaws, still holding up today in our modern day (Still doesn't have Valve's HDR) gameplay and graphicaly, a game that most FPS inspire too, the amazing, Half-Life 2. A must have, a must buy. Make sure you also get Episode One and Two (they are expansions), and best way to buy is through the Orange Box.In short words, an amazing Sci-Fi FPS and in all an amazing game, but not as good as it's sequals, amazing. You need to play this game.			"

												This game is everything that the original game is not.  Indeed, Half-Life 2 is the franchise grown up, and proving that it still has legitimacy in todays gaming world.The story of Half-Life 2 is a bit of a roller coaster in that there are great moments of narrative flow and others where you are left scratching your head a bit thinking ""why did they put that in there?"".  But saying that, there are plenty of ups to the few downs.  The story is overall strong and immersive with a few deviations that help create a vibrant lore.The game mechanics are obviously much smoother, and well structured.  By todays standards, they stand up.  There are some nice features with the engine that work well.  The feel of the game when using certain weapons and the ability to manipulate some aspects of the environment help the gameplay support the story.  There are still a few things that don't seem right, such as no hands on steering wheels, being able to climb a ladder whilst simulatenously reloading or firing a heavy weapon, getting caught on obstacles, and the clumsy and altogether painful squads that do 2 things - 1) Die over and over, and 2) Get in your way when you need to do a run and gun (or often a grenade lob and duck).  The squad could definitely have used some more commands other than point and press C to have them run uselessly a couple feet before returning to interfere.The weapons pretty much were a joy to use, especially the Pulse Rifle and the SMG.  No alien weapons to use in this game, other than the Antlion Pheropods, and this was the clumsiest weapon.  A few odd decisions were made with some of the weapons though, especially the .357 Magnum revolver.  Having a total ammo store of 18 rounds resulted in this being an often unused weapon.  Surely, Gordon could carry more than 18 bullets for this gun, considering the number he could carry for some of the others like the 9mm with a total ammo store of 168.  I'm sure it was for a balance purpose, but only being able to carry 18 rounds felt silly and frivolous.  The magnum went from being a mainstay weapon of the original series to a bit of a joke weapon in my mind.Of the gameplay, I'm so happy that they decided to move away from the platform styled approach.  Moving across impossible terrain features and engineering in the original games made it feel like a caricature of a game.  Those titles didn't know if they were a shooter, narrative or platformer, often falling more towards the latter.  This game for the most part does away with that completely.  There are still a few gameplay components that aren't well thought out, mainly by being overly long and taking something novel and at first fun, and making it tedius - namely riding the airboat, and crossing the sand without touching it.  Both were fun at first, but quickly devolved into just hoping that it would soon be over, but nope - there was more and more of it.  Still, those didn't detract too much from the game as a whole.The passage of time in the game, like in the first one though, still seems odd.  The immersion of that point is lost easily with the change from night to day as you are constantly on the move, never seeming to rest.... Jack Bauer, eat your heart out.Overall, Half-Life 2 was and still is a great game, and my concerns with the game are more exagerated nitpicks than hangups.4.5/5			"

												A must-have for PC gamers. While Half-Life 1 most certainly hasn't stood against the test of time, Half-Life 2 has aged like fine wine. Even ten years after it's release, the game looks and feels good. Playing as the mute Gordon Freeman, who arrives off the train in City 17, discovers that the city has been taken over by a force only known as the Combine. Shortly after, he meets the protagonists of the game. If I have to make a complaint, it's that none of the characters in Half-Life 2 besides Gordon and the Gman were in Half-Life 1, so you're just supposed to assume that they were there during the Black Mesa incident. To fully understand the story of Half-Life 1, all you have to do is watch the first ten minutes and the last five minutes of the game. I suggest that you skip straight to this one, and if you really want to pick up Half-Life 1 make sure it's less than $5.			"

												One of the best FPS games out there! It may be an exaggeration but Half Life 2 remains - even today - one of my favourite games. I believe this game aged well and it looks good even today which marks the 10-year anniversary of this game. Valve later on released some updates to the Source Engine so the game support widescreen and has some extra features to make it look and run better.Story-wise it is an excellent follow-up to the first game as now we have an alien race called Combine who have already invaded and enslaved humanity. Freeman - our numb protagonist - is now tasked with aiding those people who rose up to defy these visitors from space. While some of the creatures we encountered in the first episode return in Half Life 2 you mainly fight against humanoid-like creatures. It's a nice touch and it also showcases the artificial intelligence which is also superb in the game.There are varied environments in the game and there are two things that keep you interested throughout your progress: occasionally you can hop into a vehicle and drive to your next destination. Early on you cannot access this car but you can use a boat to go through a sewers-like stage. The second - and probably best - feature of the game is the Gravity Gun. A gun that does not have ammunition and requires objects - objects in your surroundings that you can pick up and launch at your enemies. There is a level specifically designed for this weapon; a level where ammo is a scarcity and you rely on the precision-aiming skill with the gravity gun.Single-player campaign offers a long (10-15 hour) experience and the game has two expansion packs (the two provide you with roughly 8-9 hours gameplay time). While Episode 1 is a bit of a letdown Episode 2 is an excellent expansion pack.I wish Valve concluded the story of Gordon Freeman with releasing a final episode (Episode 3) or a 3rd sequel. I believe this request - coming from not just me but from the community - is well justified.			"

												Because you see what happened after Black Mesa, because you want Alyx and because it's the sequel of one of the best FPS in the world.Half-Life 2 is simply set in a world post-Black Mesa, where an entity known as the Combine took control of the Earth, thanks to Dr. Breen, your ex-boss, that negociated the peace. And what peace! Police is brutal, resistance fighters are sent to their death in Nova Prospekt or bombed with Headcrabs missiles, the extinction of mankind is planned as no children can be conceived because of a force field suppressor and Dr. Kleiner, your mentor, has as pet an Headcrab (which is a sort of disaster for your buddy Barney Calhoun.The gameplay is still the same: you shoot, you kill and you try to stay alive between Headcrabs, Antlions and Combine units. And with your arsenal (bazooka, smg, shotgun, crowbar, antlion stuff, crossbow, etc..), you'll be well equipped. The Gravity Gun is also THE new feature: you can take items and throw them or just carry them. And you'll love the Super Gravity Gun at the end of the game.The story will make you visit City 17 before and during the battle for freedom, you'll also take an escape road but very dangerous, see what happens when a town is bombed with missiles, meet a crazy priest, go to the beach, break into a high-security prison and even meet Dr Breen in person. The settings are varied, now that you're outside of Black Mesa and the scientific environement.The new enemies are the Combine Army, kinda replacing the HECU units sent to Black Mesa, but with a better technology, the Antlions, a new alien race, that will be your allies and new types of zombies due to new headcrabs: a faster one and a poisonous one. You can set them in fire too.You'll ride also a buggy and a hydroboat, which is changing from the wagon cart from Black Mesa.Otherwise, the allies will be resistance fighters with their chiefs like Eli, Alyx or Barney, though Alyx will be more your sidekick by moments than Barney. Also, the Vortigaunts, these aliens from Xen with green rays, freed from their enslavement, can assist you and recharge your protection.With the Source Engine, Valve managed to get beautiful graphics but also, good physics, thanks to the Gravity Gun being the new toy for many players.And the soundtrack! It's still marvelous. Still feeling danger or sad moments or adrenaline.Half-Life 2 can be seen as perfect in every aspect... apart the loading time. Or the fact that achievements got implemented at a late date after the release of the Orange Box on Steam (X-box owners had achievements in 2007, PC players got them finally in 2010).Anyway, fun, drama and action are present and Half-Life 2 is really a must-have.

												The second game in the incredible Half Life series.Obviously this game has made VAST improvements over the original. In terms of graphics, gameplay, animations, etc. Not only that but it has a modding community. Now it may not be as grand as Bethesda's modding community. But what THIS particular modding can do uniquely is make fan-base games, and other things from the engine that Half Life 2 runs on. There aren't any real negatives to this game. Sure the vehicle controls are bit iffy when playing on a keyboard. But that's just a nitpick. You can just play this game with a controller. The game is pretty straight forward like the first one. You are 'now' legendary Gordon Freeman. You are thrusted back into the world that you ""left behind"" to come back and realize the world is different while you've been gone. A new threat has taken over the world and now it's up to you and the Resistance to put an end to the Combine.And of course, the game doesn't really give you everything all at once. It spoon feeds you. So don't expect all the answers to be um...answered! Lol. If you are a fan of the original Half Life. I recommend gettng this.			"

												I still think this is the best FPS out there. It's single player, yes, but for many of us who enjoy a good story and mechanics over multiplayer features, this games, on this genre, has no equal. Gonna make this review short, as I don't think I can add much more to what is already known.Graphics and AI are old, sure. But still looking great compared to some games nowadays. But the main focus of this review is the story behind the game. The lore. The map designs. Everything is so well done that you almost feel it's a movie and not a game. If you like FPS, this game is a must. My recommendation, however, is to first play HL1. Then get this one			"

												Half-Life 2, the amazing sequel to an amazing action series. This game has one of the most in-depth and gripping storylines I have ever played. The graphics were amazing for its time, and still hold up to this day, not to forget the outstanding physics engine, that surpasses any other game's physics no matter what.The game sucks you right in, you get instantly addicted to the storyline, even though it starts out a bit slow in the beginning. The game's characters are all extremely well done, and each one you get the maxium hate/love for them. Half Life 2 is no doubt one of the best games to ever come into existence, it would be shameful to be on steam for a very long time and not enjoy or play this game. Definetely recommend to those who want to expierence a tense, epic, adventurous, yet a depressingly beautiful game. An instant classic.			"

												This game is very successful to begin with so there isn't much to say I guess. It's a classic among the FPS genre. Featuring the source engine which was amazing at the time this game has been mind blowing.        The gameplay is very simple just like in the previous game and there's plenty of action to go on, besides that there are puzzles that come along the way. The arsenal ranges from a crowbar to a smart rocket launcher and other alien technology. There is one heroine that accompanies Gordon for a good part of the game. There's at least 20 hours of gameplay in the game without episode 1 and 2.       The story revolves around Dr. Gordon Freeman who used to work in the Black Mesa research institute and he is one of the survivors from the incident that had a major roll in the invasion of the Combine that occured afterwards. He is hired by an individual with mysterious abilities, the motives of this person are unknown to Gordon. From here on Gordon is placed in City 17 and he begins his struggle against the Combine.      The graphics and the mechanics of the game are very good to date and bug free.      The soundtrack is pretty fitting if I may say so myself.       The only issue regarding the game would be the stupidity of the NPC's and possibly the lack of harder difficulty choices and the the changes between them are minor. If you haven't played the first game, you should give it a try.			"

Half-Life 2 was created using the Source engine which runs flawlessly with gorgeous visual, physics interaction, and smooth gameplay. Half-Life 2 improves upon every single aspect of the original game including a longer and more solid story and campaign. The best thing about Half-Life 2 is the Gravity gun, which allows you to pick up and throw any object - making even a toilet a deadly weapon!

												First and foremost, Half-Life 2 is a stunning game. While I try not to hype it too much, it may be hard to do the experience justice. I have played through it at least six times, and it is still fun to get to those edge-of-your-seat moments when you may know what is going to happen, but you still need to push to make it to that point. Half-Life 2 is an amazing sequel to what has to be one of the finest games of all time. The series is very well made, the story is extremely well written, and the gameplay is nothing short of breathtaking and very animated. Playing as Dr. Gordon Freeman and seeing through his eyes is truely a spectacle to behold. There are so many interesting plot twists and delicious high-tension moments, that the only way to truely experience them is to play the game. I guarantee, once you play you will know why so many people have absolutely fallen in love with the series, and can not wait to see it continue.			"

												If you could only play one game in your entire existence on this Earth then play this game. It is a work of pure perfection and I believe you have not lived if you haven't played it. Half-Life 2 is a signal player, FPS, action, sci-fi game. It came out in 2004 yet is still an experience no other video game developer has been able to replicate. I find it amazing how this game doesn't have cutscenes or tells you what to do next. I strongly urge anyone who has not played this to buy it right now and play it immediantely. Then buy episodes 1 and 2. Then cry over the non-existence of Half-Life 3.Warning: Watch out for those head-humpers.			"

												I've played this game through many times, and it has a significant replay value, and bears the mark of Valve strongly.Valve's choice to reorient its games towards characters, and still without sacrificing much gameplay in the process is indicitive of the effect that 'Valve Time' has on their games, and although the source engine is starting to show its age, it works well with this particular title. This is because of the fact that valve used the source engine to non-verbally show character emotion (its ability to show detailed facial expressions), to help puzzle solving and to illustrate architecture, the Citadel in particular. How the game conveys all this is particularly impressive for 2004. Obviously, Source has been updated since then.However, it does fall short on the pacing on a first time playthrough, particularly in the chapter of Water Hazard and near the beginning of the game. The puzzles the game asks you to solve are pretty easy (in my opinion), but they do drag the flow of the game, often asking you to get out of your airboat to correct some flaw in the route in order to proceed. Half Life 2 can also be vague as to your objectives, but I suppose that may be just to get the player to find a way and figure it out for themselves.There is also of course, the fact that it's a linear game, where there is often only one way to proceed, but that is just the way valve have designed it so that you can immerse yourself in the perspective of Freeman. There are puzzles to get secrets as well, but these are a almost always just supplies, and a lambda on the wall to show for it, but I suppose they encourage more observant behaviour. The physics puzzles often involve different variations of balancing, which can yet again drag its pacing.The gravity gun is a good edition to the weapon selection, I found and you can do a varying number of things with just the 2 settings on it, all carefully considered (though it either involves puzzles or killing). The GMan from the first game makes a return, without wishing to spoil much, and with him a 'new' set of challenges.Overall, HL2 is a game that you can play without playing the first game, but to get a full grasp on it, you kinda have to. It is a linear game and does interrupt gameplay to make way for story (though not too frequently), so if you're a solely gameplay person, you might enjoy this but may get a bit bored at times HL and its expansions are better for that. If you're a story person, this has one of the best ones out there, as overrated as it is by some, but it does span a while. If you require both to be invested, this may appeal to you, but it very much depends on what type of story or gameplay you require. For me, for the most part, it was paced well, though I was put off for a while, but after I played the first game, it got me back into this and I finished it in a couple of sittings. It may be the same for you, it may not.Overall, I recommend this game (obviously, as that is probably the first thing you saw of this review), and it is a sequal that surpassed the original in story, but not quite in combat. It is a singleplayer Valve classic, and if you're like me, you will like it.			"

												You know, there's a reason this game won 39 Game of the Year awards, and Game of the Decade.It's GOOD. No wait, it isn't. It's not great either.It's an absolute masterpiece. It's got great and exciting gameplay, an engrossing storyline, characters you'll come to love, graphics that still look great to this day (to me at least, I've always liked the Source Engine), physics that are fun to mess around with, AI that would make GLaDOS cringe (okay, not really), an awesome soundtrack, developer commentary for those of you who like to listen to it....And a Gravity Gun.That, combined with the nostalgic value this game has to me, is why this game will always remain in my heart as my favorite video game of all time. Very highly recommended.			"

												9/10A marvel of gaming. Dang. Seriously. This freakin' game's story is top notch. It's one of those games that is just so crisp and clean, where you feel like you can do anything, that makes it such a wonder to video games. HL2's story is worth the purchase all by itself, but with the combonation of all the mods that are available to you, it allows you to reach out to so many more completely different but amazing mods. The gameplay, story, soundtrack, and everything in between in this game is perfectly crafted to create a well-rounded masterpiece of gaming. Go buy it, right now. New to gaming, old to gaming, blind, mute, deaf, I don't care, just buy it. Seriously.			"

												All hail the crowbar!This is the game that got me hooked on shooters. In that respect I guess it has a lot to answer for! And, along with Episodes 1 and 2, it remains my favourite to this day. Valve have taken their 1998 classic Half-Life and improved on it in every conceivable way. Much improved graphics, much improved physics, much improved AI, and much improved weapons, most notably the wondrous gravity gun. Once again it mixes a wide variety of spectacular environments with some satisfying puzzles and some fantastic combat. It also develops the story started in the original and fleshes it out nicely. Another important gain is the introduction of Alyx and her father Ely. Alyx will be a welcome companion and will, periodically, fight by your side. This is a big factor in HL2 -- the introduction of team play. You will have small bands of resistance fighters with you sporadically during play in the single player mode and this adds a team element which greatly increases immersion and the sense that what you do matters. I could bang on about this game for ever and a day, but just let me say this: play it -- you won’t regret it.5/5			"

												Valve set a standard with the first Half Life, and this one raises the bar. You can tell a landmark has occurred when most of what comes after is derivative in some way. The worst part of playing a game this good is being unable to enjoy mediocre titles without feeling let down. A good sign of an underperforming developer is when they react to being compared to games like this with the phrase 'gamer entitlement'. If you only play games with friends, download the Synergy mod available on Steam.			"

Sigue siendo un gran juego, pero a día de hoy, numerosos juegos le superan en cuanto a IA de enemigos y sobretodo de los compañeros, que es horrible. Un juego que marcó època, pero marcó, en pasado, ahora ya no. Destacar negativamente, aunque esto no tenga que ver nada con el juego, el nefasto doblaje al español, patética es poco, para hacer eso, que no hagan nada y lo oimos en V.O.			"

 ""By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies.""  Story  Half-Life 2 is the direct sequel to the award-winning original, Half-Life, released on Nov. 16, 2004. The story continues the adventures of past-Black Mesa researcher and scientist, Gordon Freeman. After being put in stasis by G-Man after the Black Mesa incident, Gordon is sent out again almost 20 years after the event, greeted by the barren, desolate, and oppressed world that is planet Earth. The event that was the Resonance Cascade, which opened up a portal from Xen to Earth, allowed the creatures from Xen to flood in, killing scientists and marines alike. The aliens of Xen were followed by a greater, even more powerful race, called the Combine, who started and ended the Seven-Hour war, declaring the creatures of Xen and humans of Earth as their own. They took control of the Earth, and started funnleing out a never-ending stream of soldiers, who beat down and controlled the human populace. When Gordon steps out of stasis, he joins the Resistance, a human and alien force who constantly battle the Combine to once again free the Earth.  Gameplay  Half-Life 2's Gameplay is centered around the use of weapons in combat, as in the original. Yet, as not seen before, you are now given the oppurtunity to explore your surrondings completely, finding tucked-away areas and hide-aways brimming with secrets and discoveries. The game is set in a first-person view, with your character, Gordon Freeman, not talking or reacting to the enviroment in any verbal way. This gives You, the player, complete immersion and focus, letting you feel, see, think, and do exactly how you want and the way you want. Valve, the creators of the Half-Life series, have created one of the best realistic-physics engine to date, the Source engine. This means that any and all items, vehicles, furniture, materials, weapons, creatures and people will react to the enviroment realistically, such as weight, visibility, health, and more. There are many weapons to use, such as the SMG, Rocket Launcher, and brand-new Gravity Gun. The Gravity Gun can pick up objects in the game, even the heavier ones like barrels and dressers. You can use the Gravity Gun to pick up objects out of the way, punt them great distances, and use them as blunt weapons when thrown. And, yes, the crowbar is back, which can be used for breaking obstacles and killing enemies.  Graphics  The Graphics of Half-Life 2 are made by Valve's game engine, Source. With this, the enviroment can look fresher then ever, with swaying grass and rope, white clouds and bright suns, and shiny, polished floors, and rough, cut wood. The graphics of Half-Life 2 are not, in any way, a showcase of today's games, but do feel surprsingly realistic and crisp, and look quite good even after all these years.  Overview  Half-Life 2 is a masterpiece of a game, winning over 39 Game of the Year awards, among others, and is widely considered to be the best game of all time. The characters are unique and quirky, like rebelious Alex, nervous Dr. Kleiner, and confident Eli. The enviroments range from city streets, to zombie-infested rooftops, to a Combine-controlled prsion. Weapons are powerful but require precision and focus, battles are challenging but have to be examined and tactically played, and the enviroment is breath-taking but deadly and dangerous. This is the kind of game every person should play at least once, from indie-game casuals to multiplayer tryhards. So, put on your H.E.V. suit, grab your trusty crowbar, and become The One Free Man.

												While I am not quite sure where the ♥♥♥♥ half life 3 is (Gabe Newell, take a bow), the second entry in the series is a blast to play even now, and it has been years since it was released. Mixing fun action game play, intersected by the odd puzzle or two, and an epic story, this game rightly deserves it's critical acclaim.

												Half-Life 2 is one, if not the best, first person shooter to hit the market. The only game to could top this is the first Half-Life, for reason you should know. This game has changed the way I look at games from now 'till the end of times. • The storyline is really good and makes me want to keep playing so I could see what crazy things Gordon has to do.• The soundtrack is a really good addition to this game. It just makes the entire game seem more whole. Without it I dont know how I would have been able to tell what pace the game was going in.• The graphics are really good because it marked the path for future Valve games like: Portal, Life 4 Dead, and Team Fortress 2. All of those games have been ground breakers themsleves.Over all I would highly recommend that you get this game I know you wont regret it.			"

Really you cannot be a gamer without playing this first! <3 Have some true fun with Gordon Freeman!No jokes... Why you should play this?-It is old, but it still is the masterpiece of the First Person Shooter genre-No cutscenes, you only see the world by Gordon Freeman point of view-Source Engine allows you to experience very good moments with physics-Source Engine have good graphics but even the oldest of computers still might be able to run it-The history is really interesting. (You might wanna to play Half-Life 1 first and after you finish this game, play the episodes.)-The Futuristic stuff here is awesome, despite you still see old technoloy. (This game was made on 2004, so yeah)It still keeps being the best game ever, and trust me, only HL3 will pass this game. If it will ever be released...1337/10 ...wait what?			"

												After 60 hours of playing, this is what I can say;Play it.It might be old and ""bad graphics"", but it really is worth playing trough. It does not have aim down sights like you would expect, but it doesn't need that. It has such a good rating, because it was groundbreaking at its time (somewhere about 2003). It also has puzzles and nicely paced action, so it will not get really boring all the time. Stack up crates, put weights on a seesaw, and blast enemies with chairs and toilets. Its also unique because it does not have a single cutscene (if you don't count the beginning and the ending). The game is also VERY long, so you can spend a couple of days playing this non-stop.Also, when you have played the game, you will have lots of gems you have not played. Custom maps and mods.You can find the best of them at runthinkshootlive.com(^ that sounds like a pretty stupid advertisment, but it really has the gems!)The bad bits:The chapter called Water Hazard. It feels sooooooooooooooo long when you first play the game, but you will run through it the second or the third time.			"

												Half-Life 2 is a game that surprised me greatly. Even though I still think it doesn't hold a candle original, I'm glad that I decided to take the time to try it a couple of years ago. I was reluctant to try it back then but I don't really remember why anymore. This game is great fun, which includes the Episode 1 and Episode 2 expansions. Just another great example of the work that Valve is capable of, story, game play and graphics wise. Keep in mind that this game was released several years ago so back then the graphics were well ahead of their time and this was deemed a revolutionary game, and for good reason too.This game really needs no introduction or further explanation,  so I just want to say that if you haven't played this or are reluctant to give it a try (like I was), you really should play it! Valve practically give this away in their sales even though it is worth far more than what they charge for it these days. A revolutionary game is revolutionary for a reason. Experience why and understand why Half-Life 3 is the most anticipated game in history.			"

												Valve set a standard with the first Half Life, and this one raises the bar. You can tell a landmark has occurred when most of what comes after is derivative in some way. The worst part of playing a game this good is being unable to enjoy mediocre titles without feeling let down. A good sign of an underperforming developer is when they react to being compared to games like this with the phrase 'gamer entitlement'. If you only play games with friends, download the Synergy mod available on Steam.			"

												All hail the crowbar!This is the game that got me hooked on shooters. In that respect I guess it has a lot to answer for! And, along with Episodes 1 and 2, it remains my favourite to this day. Valve have taken their 1998 classic Half-Life and improved on it in every conceivable way. Much improved graphics, much improved physics, much improved AI, and much improved weapons, most notably the wondrous gravity gun. Once again it mixes a wide variety of spectacular environments with some satisfying puzzles and some fantastic combat. It also develops the story started in the original and fleshes it out nicely. Another important gain is the introduction of Alyx and her father Ely. Alyx will be a welcome companion and will, periodically, fight by your side. This is a big factor in HL2 -- the introduction of team play. You will have small bands of resistance fighters with you sporadically during play in the single player mode and this adds a team element which greatly increases immersion and the sense that what you do matters. I could bang on about this game for ever and a day, but just let me say this: play it -- you won’t regret it.5/5			"

												Half life 2 is a game that plants you in a post apocalyptic world where you are controlled by an alien species called the ""Combine"", while playing the original game is not needed, it does slightly help explain things. If you haven't played it don't worry, the story progresses at a pace where you can learn each thing easily.The second you start you are in nothing but a moving train to help you get the hang of the controls, as you progress you can find a variety of weapons that become steadily more complex as the game progresses. While old, this game is a definite recommend for those that can afford it.			"

												One of the best games I have ever played, let alone one of the best games ever made.  Period.This game man...this game.There is no argument with saying this is one of the best game series ever made.  It has everything you need to make a good game: compelling characters, a deep and rich story, great combat mechanics, killer music, good graphics (for it's time, and even by today's standards they aren't bad.), and action.  Lots and lots of action.If you're clueless about what this game is about, you dive into the shoes of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist that escaped twenty years in the past from the Black Mesa laboratories.  In Half-Life, Gordon accidently releases a portal to Xen, an alien world, which causes massive chaos.  This includes zombies, aliens, zombies, aliens, and more zombies.  After the events of Half-Life (go play the game), you are placed into stasis by the mysterious, ""G-Man,"" who wakes you up from it right before the events of Half-Life 2.  You awaken as Freeman to a world controlled by a military group called the Combine, who have placed humanity into strict order, which is led by your old Black Mesa supervisor Dr. Breen.  You quickly learn that there is a resistance led some of your former fellow scientists, who plan to overthrow the Combine in order to make the world as it was once again.  So you get at it, becoming the face of the resistance, in order to take earth back once again.I truly can not give enough praise to Valve for making this incredible game.  I tip my hats to you, developers.So, if you haven't played this game, now is the time.  Put on your hazard suit.  Pick up your crowbar.Become the Freeman.    "

												Half-Life 2 is a game that, once you play, you will never forget.i can say wholeheartedly that this game is one of the best, if not THE best, i have ever played in my entire life.why?lets take it from the top.the game begins with a short cutscene, a monolouge by a man in the suit (dubbed, the Gman), which at the begining of the game doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but the farther you go into it, the more it will make sense to you. i should state here that knowledge of the previous game in the series (Half-life) is not required, but i will say that it is reccomended, as this games story will make more sense, as well as some of the throwbacks this game gives to its predecessor. as the Gman speaks, different locations flash on the screen, that add to the mysterious nature of this intro. Who is the Gman? Where are these places? What is he talking about? before you have time to ponder these questions, a loud horn interrupts you, as you are thrown straight into the game. you take a short monorail ride into City 17, and the game exhibits its art direction very well in this first section taking place in City 17. After events transpire, you are thrown into the action yet again, this time by yourself and only a crowbar to defend yourself. this is where the game introduces its combat system, and let me take this moment to say that this is one of the reasons i love this game. instead of showing you annoying tooltips that pop onto the screen, obscuring your vision, the game instead has you learn from experience how to use weapons. this game has a very old school feel to its combat system, and i really cant stress enough how good the combat feels and how precise it can be at times. over time, the story has you travelling to many different, beautiful looking locations (for a game from 2004, the graphical fidelity stands up surpisingly well, and at times looks better than many games being released nowadays) battling more intimidating foes as you go on. this can create some truly amazing moments in the story, such as when you battle a helicopter using an airboat with a machine gun mounted on the top of it. the sound design is good too, the music is never annoying, and the gun sounds never get on your nerves after hearing them thousands of times. in wanting to not spoil the game for those who have not played it, let me say that there are some truly emotional moments in the game, as well as some clever twists and turns placed here and there.let me end this review off with saying that, if you have not played Half-Life 2 yet, please do yourself a huge favor and purchase this game. you will not regret your decision one bit. it has truly changed the way i view games.

												Welp... Half Life 2. We meet again. What could you say about this gem that hasn't been said before? OH WeL Of corsE YOu neEd iT FUR GmoD!!11!!No... I didn't mean that... I'm talking about Half Life 2 here... not Source.Half Life 2 is, simply put, top notch. Seriously, if you haven't played Half Life 2 at least until Ravenholm (Grrrrrrrrrrr) SHAME ON YOU! I don't wanna spoil the story or the famous characters to those Steam newbies out there who were told to get Half Life 2 just for Gmod, so I'll say... PLEASE play Half Life 1 before playing Half Life 2. Half Life 2 is THE BEST Half Life game. I'm sorry, but the episodes, even with being fantastic, I couldn't help but feel REALLY empty at the intro of Episode One. Oh wait... Sorry, wrong game... AAaanyway, Even if it's not on Steam, even if it's pirated, just play it. It'll bring a lot of nostalgia (and by nostalgia I mean 3 days ago when you FINISHED Half Life 1) with the occasional funny joke, famous boss fight, and that stuffs. Me being a personal die-hard Half Life fan (profile pic), I'd recommend Half Life 2 to anyone. I'm proud and not afraid to say that Half Life 2 is one of the best, if not THE best Valve game ever made. Sure, the Source 1 (GoldSource counting as Source 0 as I call it) engine is REALLY coming of age [L4D(2), CS:GO, Portal 2], and SOME of the voice acting could have been better, but for the time... 2004... 10 friggin years ago, this game looked like Battlefield 4 back then! Half Life 2 is a game that may truly make you bow down to the One Free Man forever more. Id recommend Half Life 2 to anyone who is willing to... well... let's say it how Breen would say it...To be wise. Be safe.Be aware.11/10. And proud of it. *Bows down to the One Free GabeN*			"

												This is what happens when a perfect combination of narrative, level design, gameplay and interactivity meet. Not to mention the (at the time) mind blowing graphics. This is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of all of Valve's work and truly one of the greatest games I've played as of yet. It simply does everything right- the story keeps you immersed and the characters are all memorable, with dialogue and cinematics being one of the most interesting parts of the game, other than being just a break from combat (which happens all too often nowadays). The gunplay feels just right, and every weapon in your ever-increasing arsenal is great in its own way- different situations will call for different weapons. The gravity gun deserves mentioning though, as it is just pure awesome and allows you to truly use your environment to your advantage (hurling explosive barrels, slicing through enemies with sawlades, throwing enemy grenades back, etc.). There are also no cutscenes- every single event takes place through the eyes of Mr. Freeman, which is an approach that Valve absolutely nailed. As I mentioned before, the game continuously encourages environment interaction, and not just with the gravity gun. The clever puzzles throughout the game are an example of this. The enemy variety and artificial intelligence is also incredible. All in all, an amazing game. And, as a side note, WE WANT A SEQUEL ALREADY!!!!			"

												HALF LIFE 2 REVIEWHalf Life 2 is the first FPS I ever played. I remember when I bought the Orange Box on PS3 I was just amazed! 5 years later replaying it on PC it just adds to the amazing quality of the game. I loved every single second of it and is one my most favorite games of all time. Half Life 2 is a tense, thrilling, and all around amazing game that should be played by everyone.NOT FOR: People who don't like FPS's. I would still recommend trying it out, but if that's not really your thing, I don't think Half Life 2 would change your mind all that much. However keep in mind that this is more of an old school first person shooter, unlike say Call of Duty. This game doesn't tell you where to go or how to get there, maybe not as much as the original Half-Life, but still a far cry from the crazy hand holding a lot of modern games have today.FOR: People who want to play or try out a different stlye of FPS. This is not Call of Duty. No constant checkpoints or arrows showing you where to go. While this may prove frustrating for some...(It was for me the first time I tried it.) It proves to be extremely rewarding. On a other note this game doesn't have regenerating health which up's the challenge factor considerably. Even on easy you can every easily die if you don't react fast enough. IN CONCLUSION: I hope this review finds you well and if you want some other games like Half Life 2, make sure to get it's sequels Episode 1 & 2 . Also try out Portal and Portal 2 as they are in the same universe. (The Portal series is a puzzle game so it's different, but it's in the same story universe.)

												How does or can one begin to describe Half-Life 2? An intelligent, revolutionary shooter that stands among the greatest games of all time, the graphics are still incredible even nearly a decade later. This is essential if you have ever remotely liked gaming and Valve. Trust me, you won't regret it.			"

												THIS IS MY OPINION IF YOU DO NOT AGREE THAT IS OK!!!!half life 2 has some of the best reviews I have seen. I am fairly new to pc gaming therefore I never played this game when it was new so there is no nostalgia in here. The first thing i thought when i started playing this game was: wow these graphics are good for a game that's like, 10 years old!! my second impression was: man those combine dudes are jerks. That is one of the coolest things about half life 2. from the very starting  of the game it builds up your resentment for the combine, your main enemies throughout the game unlike some other shooter which just throw you in and say: shoot these guys. The biggest low point in the game is the vehicle sections. at first it's kinda like wupeee!! im in a boat or a car or whatever but the vehicle levels for me were long and boring.another thing about half life 2 that really is cool is the gravity gun. and while i wont spoil anthing i will tell you it is fun to use against some particular enemies. despite how old the engine is the physics are actually not that bad althougth it does sometimes glitch out when you use vehicles. (I once sent a car flying across the map when i dropped it wth a crane.) One thing that is especially amusing to watch is the combine's bodies crumple when thay are shot with a shotgun or magnum. the games music is very very bad. it sounds sci fi and techno sort of which ruins the atmosphere. the other sound however are superb.the story is pretty hard to understand if you havent played the original by the way. you may want to read something online if you absolutely must understand it.one of the high points in half life 2 is the puzzles. you don't see many shooters that use puzzles in them which is strange considering how good of reviews this game got. one example is stacking blocks on the end of a wooden plank to be able to jump to a ledge.  Bet you have never seen that in a call of duty game! here are my reviews overall. graded out of 10graphics:  8.0Story: 7.0gameplay: 8.5Level design: 9.0music: 6.5this is a superb sci fi shooter dampened only by tedious vehicle levels and a bad soundtrack                                                                      OVERALL 9.0			"

												Starting off a game like Half-Life 2 is the beginning to an adventure -and most importantly, to one of the best experiences that anyone will ever have when playing a Valve game. HL2 is the immaculate embodiment of what Valve is and stands for; it's the quintessential staple to the constituents of a modern First Person Shooter.However, parts of this game have not aged well to this day - it makes things rather difficult and odd. But, that doesn't worsen the experience by one bit - so long as you appreciate this game for what it is.[10/10]			"

												In this game you play as an immortal god of Jedis named Gordon Freeman. Gordon Freeman is very intelligent, but half retar:ded (He can't talk and probably can't count to 3). Gordon is waking up in a train after a big party at Gman's, on which he probably drank too much. After that he is walking around a City called 17 (somewhere nearby Russia). 17 is a big city with no rights for people. After that, our Jedi God gets inside a building, and because of that he is chased by the Police called Metro. 17MD (17 Metro Department) is chasing him through the building, because they want to beath him up with a big electric ♥♥♥♥♥. But as you probably can know - Our Jedi God is escaping, as he can matrix-dodge bullets on the rooftops. Then he finally gets beaten up with the ♥♥♥♥♥:s, but a girl called Alyx somehow appears from nowhere. Because of Alyx, our Jedi God couldn't go to heaven (He was going there, everything was white to him). After that, our Gordon is standing up, fixing his undestructible glasses and walks into an elevator with Alyx. After a ride, she wants to buy Jedi God a drink, but instead, she destroys the vending machine as it opens and they walk through it into another room. Then they get inside a lab where a Metro was, also an half-bald, old doctor. They were talking, and the doctor gave Jedi God his Jedi Armour. Then the girl walks into a teleporter and gets EXPLODED,KILLED teleported into another lab. Jedi God didn't had enough luck and get's teleported around the world, finally he lands outside the lab. The Metrocop called Barney throws a crowbar at his face. Crowbar - The most freaking awesome Jedi Weapon the world have seen. Our Jedi is walking around 17 beating everyone's as:s with a crowbar, r:aping women and children blah blah blah he gets to another lab and gets a Jedi Force Powered Gun (JFPG) and blah blah blah he lands in a big glowing and smoking tower called Citadel where his JFPG get's even bigger force, he rekts and pwns everyone there, and an evil gay guy escaped to another world and Jedi was trying to stop him and once again he woke up at Gman's and then he is sleeping again. The end.			"

												I'm suprised I haven't reviewed Half Life 2 before, so here goes.I've never seen a game that's perfect, no game can be perfect. But the Half Life series comes darn close to it, the only reasons why they aren't perfect is due to the AI and ocasional physics bugs. But I lose sight of those when I play it, as it has a wonderful feel to it, the world feels alive, which a lot of games seem to miss. Characters are fantasticly designed, and the voice acting was excellent for its time and still is.In all, Half Life 2 and the series are wonderfully developed, memorable shooters that have a special place in my heart.

This is my first time playing through this and it is one of the most brutal and completely rewarding games I have ever played.  The whole game just plays through start to finish.  No cutscenes or out of game sequences.  Everything happens in the game as you play.  There are no arrows, button prompts, lines to follow or help of any kind as how to proceed, I love it.  This game demands that you think about how you will get through every test of your skill.  This is what games need to be like.			"

For better or worse, HL1 and HL2 popularised linear, guided FPS games. HL2 also popularised physics as a gameplay element.I've played through this game so many times now, but I'll try to remember my first impressions from back when it came out.What I enjoyedBeing very impressed at the facial animations when Alyx leans over you that first time.Spending hours messing around with the console, spawning enemies and making them fight each other, and throwing rollermines at them with the gravity gun.Replaying Ravenholm over and over because it's like a physics playground with all the zombies and circular saws and explosive barrels... and the gravity gun.Did I mention how mind-blowing the gravity gun was that first time I used it?Loving the cast of characters. Alyx, Isaac Kleiner, Eli, Dr Breen...Approaching the Citadel little by little, that looming towering structure, until you finally reach it and enter it, genuinely unsettling... and appreciating the design decisions all the while.The music, sparingly used, perfectly setting the mood. Some of the tracks are etched in my mind, like the one at the end of Ravenholm.Playing this game again and again.What I didn't likeI miss the Black Mesa setting, and didn't really like how the story just jumped ahead in time. (I'm still hoping for a game that tells more about the events in between HL1 and HL2.)How messianic and famous and revered Gordon is in HL2. I liked it much better in HL1 when you were just some guy trying to survive. It's especially annoying how your resistance fighter allies treat you.I miss the outlandish weapons from HL1 and Opposing Force.Enemies, too. I miss the alien and varied enemies of HL1. In HL2 you're mostly fighting humans.All those loading screens. Gosh, so many loading screens. And you see a long corridor with a bend at the end and you just *know* there's a loading screen coming.That ending sucked. It worked in HL1 because it was the first time. But HL2 also ending with you being ""shelved""? Not cool. (All was forgiven with the beginning scene of HL2 episode 1.)I remember playing through this on New Year's eve. Fun times. Oh and, if you're getting this, get Episode 1 and 2 also. HL2 Episode 2 is my favourite of the entire series.			"

The plot of this sequal will not drag on (most of the time) and the ever changing enviroments and atmospheres will keep you immersed in the gameplay until you see credits moving across your screen. And same goes for Episode 1, Episode 2, and ........ 11/10			"

												The Orange Box, or perhaps Half Life 2 itself, is the greatest value in all of gaming history. Why? Because with just HL2 you unlock the ability to literally play thousands of free mods, some of which are of higher quality or more fun than HL2 itself, as well as the tools to make your own mods and maps. If you haven't played HL1 and are worried about HL2, Don't. The story is just as bizarre as ever and the token ""unexplainable ending"" of all Half Life games has returned yet again.			"

												This game is the greatest FPS out there.It is a VERY long game with surprises and exciting moments.Sometimes you just stumble upon games,and if you stumbled upon this one, you would be glad you did.This game requires logic,skill,and a trigger finger.If you don't have this,get ALL the half life games.I rate the entire half-life series 10/10.Get this game NOW!!!ples			"

												Игра всех времён и народов! Однозначно, без базара. Идеал игростроения. Совершенство симбиоза геймплея и сюжета. Может казаться, что надо быть поехавшим чтобы игру, рассчитанную на 12-13 часов прохождения, играть вот уже 10 год подряд оставляя за собой море времени, тысячи часов прохождения первой части, различных дополнений официальных и не только, 2-ой части, эпизодов и т.д. - но это единственная игра, которая уводит тебя под саунды Келли Бэйли в мир Half-Life, в мир где ""он — словно озарение, после него понимаешь, какой гадостью тебя кормили последние годы"". Мир, который как бриллиант, который навсегда. Который при каждом новом запуске оного открывается по разному. Закончу цитатой известного издательства: ""Если вы видели Half-Life 2, то считайте, что видели лучшую компьютерную игру на этой планете"". О да! О да!! ДА!			"

			This is the first time I've done anything like this and I spent a while getting the audio to a suitable level. however if you think it's off or you have any other criticism, let me know.		

This is the follow up to the masterpiece that was the original Half-Life.This game has a beautiful story, amazing graphics, great A.I. which is still rare to see in games even today.You'll have a vast array of weapons that you'll pick up throughout the game, each of them feeling unique with, damage, range, effects and occasionally secondary fire.Driving sequences are fun and smooth to play.The game is full of memorable characters. Both good and evil.Synopsis: You are Gordon Freeman, a scientist that worked at the Black Mesa Research Facility, You've just been awoken from stasis by the G-man, after the 7 hour war between the human resistance and the Combine. You'll meet up with new and old characters alike and try to take the earth back from the Combine.If you still haven't played this game, I highly recommend it.			"

												The game is very nice to play. It's a wonderful trip with Gordon Freeman, across a weird and ""dark"" world. It's never boring, the story and the universe of the game are very good. The graphics are pretty fine too! However there is no multiplayer mode. Anyway you still have fun while playing this game, even if you are alone. Each chapter is very different. I really recomend you to try Half-Life 2 if you've never played it! Valve made, once again, an amazing game.78 / 100			"

												Half Life 2 is good lengthy game and plays much like how my brother Al enter UK through Calais.You play mute genius gun nut scientist.  Maybe this guy grew up watching Krypton Factor on mute?  When you get to final level in citadel it like designer turned over to channel 4 and now watching Crystal Maze.  You British have crazy television!Half Life 3 will contain a large pool across bottom of level where you need to run and jump across red balls.Half Life 4 will be based in a glass container where Noel drops in dollar bills before a guy called Liam screams ""Blobby Blobby Blobby"" and creams all over your face with buckets.  Then a cat walks by.Half Life 5 will require invitation to professional snooker players to pot colour balls for money.  Jim slaps Alex on ♥♥♥ but then Virgo slaps Jim in face.  Court case pending.There will be no Half Life 6 due to number 6 rhyming with profanity.All this happen in 2019.  My Aunt Bernera tell me.			"

												Half Life 2 really is one of those games, even all these years later, that I keep coming back to. Though there are games that do a few of the things better HL2 did back then, it's exceedingly hard to find a game that attempted everything it did, let alone came close to the level of quality HL2 had all around. In general the Half Life series is a set of games that every gamer should look into to gain a deeper appreciation of the progress the industry has made.			"

												(Spoilers in this review read with caution and skip spoilers if you're new to half-life)hello. i'm here to review the wonders of the already popular (wich means i mabye be one of the few couple hundred who have not played this yet, untill now) half life 2.this game includes good and terrible backstabbing characters, packed in with alot of enimies and fighting, and some very challanging puzzles, with of course that special thing ValVe puts in their games to  make you finish the game in a week, then want moreXD (that could just be me though) but  theres also (of course) diffulcty settings. easy: easy, but still challanging  normal: hard, but could be worst. and hard: this will make rage very very hard. there also subtitles so you can understand what the characters are saying, this is expectingly good if you're voice chatting.the characters include     alex vance: useful and good character at later of the game:people call her the ""hacker"".  Barney:funny in game, disguises as a metro cop, some call him the ""inflintraitor""  dr. klenier: the scientist, also one of the first people you meet, other than barney and alx.  eli vance: another scientist: you spend almost the whole game either trying to (spoiler alert?) save and or trying to get to the lab, also alx vances father. Dog: a robot, that acts like a dog, built to protect alx vance, also a total BAD-A , later in the game, dr. judith mossman: a assistant that ""helped"" eli vance, (SPOILER ALERT BY A BIG TIME) is a traitor, but comes around near the end of the game, dr. wallace breen: the main bad guy, boss of the combines and metrocops, father grigory,a side character: but hes very usfel in chapter 6, ravenwholm (sorry if i spelt that wrong), also gives you the shotgun (a very good weapon), and lammar: just a bonus character, kleniers pet, is a headcrab, useless, breaks the teleporter to elis lab, keeps running away, Gman: mysterious character, appears watching you through out the game, only confronts you 2 times during the game. enemies in the game: fast zombies,zombies,poisionzombies,headcrabs,poisionheadcrabs,fast headcrabs, combine, shot gun combine,combine elite, man hacks, metrocops,striders, combine gun ships,dr. breen, combine drop ship (dont actually fight it), rollermines, zombie and fast zombie torsos, antilons, antlion guard,hunter choppers, combine sentrys, combine celing turret, combine camera. there are 13 chapters and 14th being the credits. i perfectly reccomend this game and more, it has everything, puzzles, action, good story,good characters,intence battle music, not to bad graphics, and weapons, secrets, and achievemnets, and who knows probably more!

												Is it really time to talk about half life 2? This is going to be a long one... Introduction Three days ago I had some money in my steam wallet and it was the Winter sale so I decided to get half life 2, HL2 episode 1, and HL2 episode 2. After I bought these games it became my most favorite steam game ever and I sit here with the question everyone has, when will Half Life 3 or Half Life 2 episode 3 get here? Main Review From the  Wake up... and smell the ashes... to  Is it really that time again?  I LOVED this game from its intense fights with the combine and civil protection, scary encounters with zombies, and puzzles that I  looked up how to do  it perfected all of it totally! Also the story, it is one of my PERSONAL favorites withs its mysteries of how the combine came here to who is G-Man? Its uses the nice source engine that runs very well and I get 100+ on a non-gaming computer so low-end computers can run this very well. My favorite part was probably  SPOILER ALERT  ..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

The gunplay is awesome, the puzzles suit the engine and the car level is amazing. Since your on Steam, you should buy this. This is a part of pc gaming history.

												Half Life 2 really is one of those games, even all these years later, that I keep coming back to. Though there are games that do a few of the things better HL2 did back then, it's exceedingly hard to find a game that attempted everything it did, let alone came close to the level of quality HL2 had all around. In general the Half Life series is a set of games that every gamer should look into to gain a deeper appreciation of the progress the industry has made.			"

												This is in my top 3 games of all time. For me, everything just clicks in this game, but most notably the atmosphere and characters. First off, you do not need to have played the first half life to appreatate this one, and in fact the first time I played HL2, I barely even knew what the first one was about. The dystopian setting has always been one of my favorites, and this game protrays this perfectly. Everything in the game seems as if it is barely working and is about to fall apart. Although the game is now nearly 10 years old, its graphics still look pleasing, and the art style is as amazing as always. The level variety is stunning, and thoughout the ten hour campagin, it never begins to become boring. The characters feel like people, and you begin to genuinely care about them. Each weapon feels unique, and I ended up using almost all of them at one point or another. (Something I think they improved over Half Life 1) This game is basically created Steam, so please buy this wonderful game! And if this game doesnt sound interesting to you, there are litterally hundreads of mods, so almost as great as the orginal game. There is no reason not to buy this game, though if you have the money, get the Orange Box for sure, as it has much more value. Pros:+Story+Gameplay+Characters+Physics+Litterally everythingNeutral:*No multiplayer (But it doesnt need it)Overall: 10/10 I love this game, and have played though it about four times. I can find nearly no flaws, please buy this game, you have no idea what you are missing.			"

												REVIEW WAS EDITED!This game is by far one of my most favorite games. It has a great story through the whole game as it takes place about 10-20 (Not exactly sure when) years later as you play through under the combines control but later all the people decide to rebel and make a squad know as the rebels in the uprising as you fight through City 17 to stop Dr.Breen. Dr.Breen is the mastermind of the combine who he has the combine try to take Eli Alyx and Gordon. Finally you stop Breen and put an end to has Dark fusion reactor. Also know as his teleporter to another universe. Tired of MW2 or any other gay ♥♥♥ COD? Then pick up this game, and you'll know what a real game this is because games are usually crap, like COD On a scale from 1-10 I would rate this game a good 9.6 as it has a good story and you can pick up stuff and throw it around it's basically a sandbox game with a story to it. God damnit I'm still waiting for Half-Life: 3 to come out, I heard it's coming out with Valve's new source engine along with Left 4 Dead 3. I can't believe that Valve has made great franchises, and this is one of those great classic ones. You can be creative in any way as to how you can kill your enemies, disapate them, make 'em explode, run them over, and one of my most favorite, shooting objects with the Gravity Gun. They don't have that in COD, do they? Nope, didn't think so, now I'm not saying I hate COD, but it's ♥♥♥♥ compared to Half-Life, and this game wins over COD any day, that's for sure.			"

												Now for this beast. And man, I thought the first Half Life was amazing. Let me start off by saying this game is an absolute masterpiece. This game completely blows the first Half Life out of the water. Half Life 2 I can say has aged much better than the original Half Life despite Half Life 2 being over 10 years old. While the story seems to come out of nowhere by looking at the end of Half Life, I can say without a doubt the story here is much better than the original and is extremely engaging right off the bat with a stellar intro that grabs your attention. As you walk through just the beginning the world around you looks amaing and is attention grabbing.The atmosphere and design of the world deserves a whole paragraph to itself, so here it is. Much like Star Wars Half Life takes a very used future approach to City 17 and the areas outside of it. Everything in City 17 looks run down and dirty. I love it. City 17 gives off a very unique vibe I have never felt before and is very well put together. As for the area surrounding City 17, I was mainly referring to the endless amount of sewage pipes outside City 17 that have multiple chapters dedicated to them and Highway 17. This whole area helps complelety cement the used future feel of the game. And for Highway 17, I honestly can't describe this section in words, it's a very cool area is really all I can think of to say. As for the VERY unique areas like Nova Prospekt, The Citadel, and Ravenholm, they are all in a whole different category. First off, Nova Prospekt. This area feels and probably looks the closest to present day. It actually feels like a real prison and really gives off the absolute worst place to be like it is trying to give off. Next, The Citadel. Oh man, if there was ever a great place to stage a finale this is it. It gives off a really creepy vibe and is one of the very few things in the game that feels futuristic. The design of the interior of this place is amaing and easily one of the coolest places I have ever seen in a video game. And finally, Ravenholm. Ravenholm, the zombie town, was very creepy to walk through and had me genuinly scared at times it was so well done. I know I have said this before but I have never seen any thing like it.Now for what the original Half Life lacked, characters. Although as of writing this, I have not played Bue Shift, I can say I really liked Barney and thought he was pretty funny at times. As for Eli, I also throughly enjoyed Eli's character and thought he was a very good addition to the game. Dr. Kleiner was also a very good character even tough he did not get much screen time. Now, let's address the elephant in the room I have been neglecting, Alyx. Alyz was a very well written charcter and more or less a sidekick to Gordon as she helped him out whenever she was around. She was a very no nonsense kind of girl and was a kickass and strong chracter, which is hard to see in females in video games.And now, the meat of the game, the gamplay.I'm just gonna say it; this is one of the funnest games of ever played. No joke. Offering a wide variety of weapons all that are good for certain purposes, I never felt that any of the weapons were unnecessary. As for the actual gameplay, it is extremely well done with an awesome mix of both puzzles and action. While somewhat cryptic, none of the puzzles were overy cryptic or annoying and never really hindered gameplay very much. Hell I had more trouble trying to find where to go next in some cases.As for the music in this game my thoughts about it are almost identical to my thought's about the original's. While somewhat campy feeling the music was very good and an absolute treat to hear whenever it very uncommonly came on.The graphics. Oh man the graphics. While the graphics do look very slightly dated, they still hold up suprising well, although I believe this is mostly due to the very realistic looking faces and fluid animations. No matter how dated, I still love the graphics of this game and they quite frankly look amazing to me, even if it doesn't look like a modern triple A game.As for my complaints, I have almost none. The only thing I can say that annoyed me was the AI of your squad as they would often get in the way and make it hard to move around at times. Everything else about this game makes up for it 10 times over though, so it's easily overlookable.Overall I really enjoyed this game and would EXTREMELY recommend it to anyone looking for a very well done sci-fi action game.10/10 one of my favorite games and among the best I have played.

												(Spoilers in this review read with caution and skip spoilers if you're new to half-life)hello. i'm here to review the wonders of the already popular (wich means i mabye be one of the few couple hundred who have not played this yet, untill now) half life 2.this game includes good and terrible backstabbing characters, packed in with alot of enimies and fighting, and some very challanging puzzles, with of course that special thing ValVe puts in their games to  make you finish the game in a week, then want moreXD (that could just be me though) but  theres also (of course) diffulcty settings. easy: easy, but still challanging  normal: hard, but could be worst. and hard: this will make rage very very hard. there also subtitles so you can understand what the characters are saying, this is expectingly good if you're voice chatting.the characters include     alex vance: useful and good character at later of the game:people call her the ""hacker"".  Barney:funny in game, disguises as a metro cop, some call him the ""inflintraitor""  dr. klenier: the scientist, also one of the first people you meet, other than barney and alx.  eli vance: another scientist: you spend almost the whole game either trying to (spoiler alert?) save and or trying to get to the lab, also alx vances father. Dog: a robot, that acts like a dog, built to protect alx vance, also a total BAD-A , later in the game, dr. judith mossman: a assistant that ""helped"" eli vance, (SPOILER ALERT BY A BIG TIME) is a traitor, but comes around near the end of the game, dr. wallace breen: the main bad guy, boss of the combines and metrocops, father grigory,a side character: but hes very usfel in chapter 6, ravenwholm (sorry if i spelt that wrong), also gives you the shotgun (a very good weapon), and lammar: just a bonus character, kleniers pet, is a headcrab, useless, breaks the teleporter to elis lab, keeps running away, Gman: mysterious character, appears watching you through out the game, only confronts you 2 times during the game. enemies in the game: fast zombies,zombies,poisionzombies,headcrabs,poisionheadcrabs,fast headcrabs, combine, shot gun combine,combine elite, man hacks, metrocops,striders, combine gun ships,dr. breen, combine drop ship (dont actually fight it), rollermines, zombie and fast zombie torsos, antilons, antlion guard,hunter choppers, combine sentrys, combine celing turret, combine camera. there are 13 chapters and 14th being the credits. i perfectly reccomend this game and more, it has everything, puzzles, action, good story,good characters,intence battle music, not to bad graphics, and weapons, secrets, and achievemnets, and who knows probably more!

												I consider Half-Life 2 to be one of the best single player first person shooters ever created.  At the time of release it was groundbreaking and almost a decade later there are still few FPS out there that can stand up to it.  The level design, the immersive atmosphere, the innovative use of physics, the graphics (which still hold up), the structure, the pacing, the characters, the story, the weapons...all are exceptional.  It's a game that can be played over and over.  One negative would be the AI which was decent at the time but feels a little dated now.  That's a minor gripe.  An almost perfect game.			"

												Do not consider yourself a gamer untill you've played this. Arguably one of the greatest PC Games ever. It revolutionised gaming and did a great job at showing off amazing graphics for its release in late 2004. No cutscenes that come between you and the game, making the player feel that much more immersed. Once you've played this game make sure to play HL2 E1 and E2.I also recommend purchasing the first Half Life aswell as its spin off games Half Life Blue Shift and Half Life Opposing force.			"

												This game is no doubt a masterpiece. When I initially played this game a long time ago, I didn't like it. I thought it was just a generic sci fi FPS with a mediocre story. After giving this game another go years later, I finally understand this game. There is far more to Half-Life 2 if you're willing to dig a little deeper. The entire game manages to create this very surreal and mysterious atmosphere that really creates a very unique tone. The level design is fantastic. It manages to guide you through nonlinear areas without giving you a map or checkpoints. The characters are all very distinct and interesting. Each character contributes to the game in very idiosyncratic ways. Every aspect of this game seems to come together to create a very peculiar effect that matches nothing I've ever seen before. Half-Life 2 is a very fine example as to how video games are an art and have the ability to evoke meaningful and thought provoking feelings.			"

												Best Game of 2004. Even better than the first HL, wow I didn't think it was possible. While it is a shooter, it involves a lot more gameplay types, it allows you to drive through to point A-B with intense action, areas where you need to sneak past, you get to control troops of rebels (and even antlions at one point). And the regular shooting is great, it's also a true sequel meaning it's just a bunch of higher tech HL. (with the same physics puzzles and similar gameplay) It also has one of the best sci-fi storyline's of the century, including characters, dialog, and of course just story in general. It introduces a new gun that is just OMG, try launching a paint can at something, see how much damage that will cause. Just amazing, like HL1, I really have NOTHING negative to say.Rated: 10/10			"

												The game changer. The bar to which all other FPS's should judge themselves and be judged by.Upon it's release Half Life 2 was cutting edge, not just for a follow up FPS, but for games in general.Graphics and set peices that hold up even now, 8 years on from it's release.Gravity effects, AI that flanks, nades, covers and changes their behavior seeds with every load and save made.Topped off with totally immersive story and charcters, a must for any dystopian/ Orwellian fan. After opening a portal to another world at the Black Mesa research facility in Half Life, the Earth came to the attention of an all powerful Alien force, who after brushing aside all of the worlds defences in the '7 hour war' have now enslaved humanity and are slowy draining the planet of all its' natural resorces.Order is maintainted via a 'combine' military force of half alien half human hybrids that have grouped up the remaining human kind into large rundown numbered Citys.""Wake up and smell the ashes""			"

												So my first play through of this game was nearly 12 years after it was initally released, I can gladly say that it was a great expereince all round. Most games of similar age don't quite hold up these days, but this game still looks gorgeous, handles exceptionally and has a great yarn to it.My only complaint would be that Gordon being an amazing scientist surely would've been able to create some form of longer lasting flash light.All in all great experience, will recommend to anyone that has never played before.

												This game is no doubt a masterpiece. When I initially played this game a long time ago, I didn't like it. I thought it was just a generic sci fi FPS with a mediocre story. After giving this game another go years later, I finally understand this game. There is far more to Half-Life 2 if you're willing to dig a little deeper. The entire game manages to create this very surreal and mysterious atmosphere that really creates a very unique tone. The level design is fantastic. It manages to guide you through nonlinear areas without giving you a map or checkpoints. The characters are all very distinct and interesting. Each character contributes to the game in very idiosyncratic ways. Every aspect of this game seems to come together to create a very peculiar effect that matches nothing I've ever seen before. Half-Life 2 is a very fine example as to how video games are an art and have the ability to evoke meaningful and thought provoking feelings.			"

												Half-Life 2: Deathmatch brings back the adrenaline pumped feeling from old Deathmatch classics such as Unreal tournament and Quake. With improved graphics, physics and a combination of the half-life 2 story this game is filled with rush. Equip your gravity gun and throw a toilet at the enemy, the amount of props will get annoying though since they are in your way. A *FANTASTIC* multiplayer experience, that is if you have the skill. If not, it gets incredibly annoying and frustrating. Even if so, getting this along with the regular HL2, is definitively worth it, I never really knew why they released the two games separately.

												Great action, great adventure, great plot, but if you haven't seen walkthroughs or you suck at first person shooters, then play on Easy, or you WILL DIE ALOT!!!!P.S., GUNS ARE SO FREAKING OVERPOWERED BUT I DON'T CARE BECAUSE YOU CAN KILL ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!			"

												Great game, revolutionary in its time, my only qualms with it are as follows:Chapter 1: Point Insertion was and is still my favourite chapter of this game, I feel it wasn't focused on enough, don't get me wrong, it's so sublimnal, so detailed, to the point of perfection.  I just feel this should of be its own game, never to be I guess. (HL2RP exists though)Combine radio chatter very hard to hear, I think they should make it louder for the sake of hearing.I wish the games chapters had less time spent alone, more time with a companion i.e Barney, or a Rebel.  It seems like it would of added quite a bit more depth and story expostion time to the game.More speeches from Breen, not enough to go around! "

												Played the first game when I was 6. Not really sure what was going on back then when I played it. Played this at my cousin's house when it came out and wasn't sure what was going on then either, but it was totally a brand new experience. Gonna be honest, I never got around to playing the first game again, so I still have no idea what this game is about other than that you're some important famous dude that kills and destroys stuff somehow with a manky old crowbar. If you have Steam, you're kinda obligated to have a Valve game, so just get this one.			"

												Amazing story, amazing characters, amazing gameplay, amazing setting and atmosphere. This game is the closest to perfection you can get with a game. A true masterpiece and a game that will stand the test of time. If you haven't played it yet, pick it up, it's pretty cheap and you'll immediately be immersed in the game.			"
