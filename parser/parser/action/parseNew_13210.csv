												The best multiplayer shooter I've ever played. There are hundreds of things to learn. The game is divided into different game modes (like Warfare, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Duel, Capture The Flag, Vehicle Capture The Flag, ...), and the community is constantly creating new mutators and new maps, so it never gets boring.UT3 is a very fast paced thrilling game and you have special movements like dodging and wall dodging which are hard to master but it makes you moving even quicker and much harder to hit. It doesn't matter how tired you are before the game: As soon you're in the game you feel like on adrenaline with eyes wide open and an alert mind. You will hardly experience a boring moment. So if you are looking for a comfy boring game to call it a day and make yourself ready for sleep --- then you are completely wrong with UT3. In the first few weeks UT3 felt kind of ridiculous fast. However, after a while my brain adapted and I got used to it. Since then, whenever I try to play another shooter  the new shooter feels slow like sneaking and without dodge and wall dodge movement like beeing an immobile target.In other words: It takes you a while to get accustomed with UT3. But once you mastered it you are like edicted and it's hard to go back playing other shooters.I've played it more than 10.000 hours, first without Steam, now with Steam, still playing almost every dayPlease recommend my review if it gave you an impression of the game			"

												If you haven't played Unreal Tournament, just get the game straight away. If you've played the older versions, check out my observations:Pros:- Very balanced vehicles. Now manta is not immortal and scorpion and hellbender are formidable rather than useless.- Hoverboards. Being able to get a speed boost is one of the greatest additions to UT.- Orbs for Warfare (Onslaught). These allow lots of strategic defense/offense in Warfare.- Characters move with more gravity. I know this is subjective, but honestly I prefer the feel of the UT3 controls to the previous ones.Cons:- Campaign story is not really finished.- No Assault.TLDR: If this had Assault, it would be the best UT game out there. As it is, it is still awesome and worth playing!PS: I played the game for a year before activating it on steam too.			"

												This....This is.... The only game I can compare to the HL universe. I own UT1999 GOTY, UT2004 on discs. UT3 was also on disc but I registered it on Steam...Now on the actual game:Graphics: 9/10For 2008 these graphics are perfect so Epic did their job very well on this part:I take 1 point away because it was really hard to run the game on max settings in 2008...Gameplay: 10/10It doesnt matter if you are against bots, doing the campaign, playing multiplayer. Its perfect. Action is everywhere!Soundtrack: 10/10 Ive always loved to listen the soundtrack of the Unreal Tournament games. The fit perfectly for the maps.Map Design: 69/10 OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG! ♥♥♥♥♥ please! We are talking about EPIC here.+ You can easily learn to map. Learn in 30 minutes. Start creating maps like a fokken machine!Overall: 10/10I really cant hate on this game. Dont look on my Steam hour plays. Before Steam I have hundreds of hours on this one.On UT2004 I am even sure I have thousands....*nostalgia attack*There is still lovely comunity to play with multiplayer so I definitely recomend THIS EPICness.

												After putting over 100 hours on UT3, I still like UT2K4 more, but I do feel it has one thing going for it. That's the Vehicle Capture-The-Flag gamemode. It is the perfect combination of teamwork and individual skill. There needs to be someone who can snatch the enemies flag and move it effectively while being gimped (Flag carriers cannot use vehicles). The rest of the team needs to simultaneously support the carrier as well as protect their own flag.All of this is made more complex by a diverse array of vehicles and this is further complicated by the fact that one team may not have the same vehicles available to them as the opposition. And somehow the game maintains balance! It is an incredible feat of game and map design.This game has other merits worth mentioning. It's still gorgeous after all this time. Soundtrack lives up to the brand. The Godlike AI is still intelligent as hell (aggravatingly so on vanillla CTF).Definitely worth your money and the time your minced bits will layer the walls like a grisly fresco.			"

												While it's not as accessible or as popular as its predecessors, UT3 is still a fun arena shooter with loads of colorful characters and maps to go around. The campaign has an actual story rather than being just another single-player tournament, although for the most part it's just multiplayer with humans against computer-controlled characters once again. Still, all the weapons and gamemodes you know and love are there (except for Assault, which is disappointing).Good luck finding a active server, though; everyone else has already flocked off to play the upcoming UT alpha (which I recommend you try out, by the way), and what's left of the game's community has less life than a Necris assassin.

												Before Battlefield and CoD there was Unreal and there was Quake. I've always been an ""Unreal is better than Quake"" sort of gamer and this iteration of UT is a strong example of why.The core deathmatch gameplay is refined to near perfection, lots of game modes, with great weapons, vehicles and maps. Some achievements are challenging, but all can be attained by a dedicated player with several helpful guides available online. I played primarily against the AI Bots, which offer a decent enough challenge to make this a viable single player game. "

 Originally posted on August 21, 2009 Unreal Tournament 3 was an easy purchase after the incredible UT2004, at least for me. It promised more of the same awesome gameplay with a brand new engine that looks gorgeous. For the most part, UT3 lives up to the brand name, despite some minor quibbles.Visually speaking, the game is phenomenal, with an engine that may not be so new as of 2009, but still looks absolutely great. it really shines in UT3's very meticulously crafted beautiful maps, which is where you can see the full potential of the engine. The lighting and particle effects especially are very pretty, from and artistic standpoint, and they stay true to UT's unique art design and feel. I have no complaints on this front.The sound effects in the game are for the most part quite good, with the timeless beacons of success like ""monster kill!"" and ""dominating!"" making a glorious return. The macho voice acting is of course completely over the top, but this is really to be expected, and as far as I'm concerned, it comes with the territory.The gameplay is good, for the most part. DM, TDM, CTF, and every combination of vehicles in battlefield style flag capping and vehicle CTF make an appearance, along with a few more bizarre game modes, and of course good old fashioned duel. There are a plethora of maps, character models, and mutators to suit your particular fancy, and the weapons look, sound, and feel really satisfying and true to the series, with the rocket launcher and flak cannon making particularly gruesome returns. Puzzling, however, is the lack of objective based attack and defend game modes like in UT2004, which saw sides attacking objectives and progressing ultimately towards a final target with a time limit, and then teams would switch sides and try to do better. But wait, you say, UT3 has exactly that in the form of warfare. This is technically true, but UT2004 had some very map specific objectives in very creative scenarios that as far as I can tell are missing from UT3. Where is the space station assault mission? or the tram attack? Oh well, minor quibbles, all in all the gameplay is quite good.As far as bang for your buck, UT3 is quite impressive, with 40 plus hours of gameplay at least, and theoretically much more. While the campaign isn't to interesting, these games have never been about single player, although the bots are quite adept if you choose that route. With the new Titan pack and the possibility of more free content, UT3 will last me a for a long time to come.I can heartily recommend it as a purchase well worth the investment to any fan of shooters, especially those from an older generation, or previous fans of the series.

-Quick Review-Unreal Tournament 3 is a First person shooter developed by Epic Games, Inc. and released in 2007. I'm not sure what else I should include in my Quick Review Section... There's tons of content, the single player is pretty solid, there are still plenty of servers with small clusters of people playing multi-player, and getting Co-Op to work over steam was a pain in the butt (we used Hamachi).-Detailed breakdown review-Just a heads up:This is the first Unreal Tournament Game I've ever played. Once I beat the game, and then re watched all the cutsenes I realized I had NO idea why the game was called ""Unreal Tournament"". There was no Tournament, there wasn't anything unreal about it, unless we're talking about respawning...For those in the dark about it, earlier Unreal Tournament games actually did take place in a tournament. The ""Unreal"" part of the name is probably because the whole Unreal franchise uses the Unreal Game Engine.Oh wait, I get it, the main driving feature for this game is area-shooting (I normally think of the Campaign as the primary selling factor), so there we go, mystery solved while writing this review. I feel silly.


Footage from a cut-scene in Unreal Tournament 3. 
A Screenshot of Unreal Tournament 3: Black Edition
By: Atratzu




Story: There are 5 factions in Unreal Tournament 3: Iron Guard (mercenaries), The Ronin (which is the faction you are part of in the story, you may play as the others in multiplayer though. The Ronin are survivors from a Krall attack), The Krall (I like to think of them as Orcs and Orgres, so naturally I would prefer to be playing as them), The Liandri (Basically Robots), and lastly the Necris (sounds like Necromancer? Basically they're the Borg, or undead. They're pretty Metal.)In all honesty I barely noticed the difference between Humanoids and factions, Red is Dead in my book. The most distinct Faction was the Krall, and I don't feel like I really fought against them all that much. (which is odd... seeing as they massacred the Ronin's Village...?)The story is made up of 5 Acts, each Act starts out with a Cut scene, and before you jump into a mission you're given a short description or background for why you're attacking and what your mission is.Oh, by the way the protagonist's name is ""Reaper"", whom is not nearly as Edge lord as we're used to from Overwatch, but as far as deep voiced rough protagonists go, he's pretty standard.Incase this is spoiler territory for people:Act 1) The Ronin's Village is sacked by the Krall, the Ronin hook up with the Iron Guard and they all go to war against the Axon. Wait, who are the Axon? I'm glad you asked, they're apparently not an offical faction, they're the primary vehicle developers and the Iron Guards leader ""Malcolm"" is an idiot (actually he's an opportunist, but the game paints him as a fool)Act 2, 3, and 4 just kind of blurr together as ""more the same"" Act 5 is when stuff gets serious and the Ronin are like ""Screw this, we're going to go fight the Necris Lady who attacked our village our self"". And I won't risk saying anything more in detail on that, because THAT would be way more spoilery then I do.All-in-all, the campaign felt like playing a bunch of different online pvp games but with bots, all strung together with dialogue before playing the mission and every 10 missions a cut scene.Gameplay: The Gameplay is where Unreal tournament 3: Black Edition Shines! First... The core of every FPS: Which kinds of guns do you get?1) A hammer gun you will probably never use again, 2) a pistol you only use if you're out of ammo or respawned, 3) a poison bio weapon which leaves green death bubles on the ground walls and ceiling, 4) a Laser rifle which I don't think has a distance limit, 5) Your standard ""rifle"" type gun, it fires a lot of little energy bullets at a typical rate (visible and dodge-able however!), 6) Good 'ol Gatling gun, 7) Shot gun, careful with this one kids, the bullets ricochet and I have killed myself with it more times then I'd care to admit, 8) Rocket Launcher (it's death. highest damage, moderate speed rockets, splash damage, or nail 'em in the rib cage to watch 'em explode), 9) Sniper rifle.There are a number of special weapons you can pick up and find, and in multiplayer games they may even mod the weapons to behave differently, but generally speaking the aforementioned guns are your standard staple in the campaign.I should also mention that some weapons have an alternative shot by clicking the right mouse button, the one that sticks out in my mind is the rocket launcher will charge up 3 rockets and fire them at once, and the shot gun fires a round shot which explodes into tons of smaller shots.)Next Vehicles... I'm not going to list them, but there are a lot of them, each has a pretty unique feel to it, getting used to controlling them takes some time, especially Necris vehicles (Two vehicle manufacturers: Axon, and Necris)There are 3 options on the main menu if you want to jump into the game. Campaign, Instant Action, and Multiplayer. Campaign is for the ""story"", Instant Action is for offline play, and Multiplayer is for online play.


Pro-tip to anyone starting: The + in the bottom right is your health, the object on the ground is a health kit. - I wish I had known earlier 
A Screenshot of Unreal Tournament 3: Black Edition
By: Atratzu




Health pickups, power ups, Armor, jump boosters, and more!Game types: Deathmatch (Free for all), Team Death match (Industry Standard), Capture the Flag (Same as when we were kids, only with guns), Vehicle CTF (Same as normal CTF except you can run your friends over), Warfare (A long game of capture the control point, ended by blowing up the core in the enemy's base), Greed (Kill people, pick up skulls, try to reach it to the enemy spawn room to score), Betrayal (really really REALLY weird, you kill enemies until you're assigned to a team, then you right click to fire off a blue shot which will kill people on your team, then you hide and you keep your score), Duel (1v1 me bro).


I joined this server which played ""I Believe In Father Christmas"" by Greg Lake on loop. Very festive, until the 10th loop. haha 
A Screenshot of Unreal Tournament 3: Black Edition
By: Atratzu




There are a total of 60 maps... SIXTY! That's crazy.Conclusion: I must be getting long winded in my old age, I didn't think I had this much to say about Unreal Tournament 3: Black Edition. I had a lot of fun playing it, I don't think I'll be sticking around with it much longer though... the achievements are a bit too tedious for my tastes and there are other games to review!Someday down the line I might come back to this game, but as far as FPS's Go, this one is pretty good. You could definitely sink a fair amount of time into the game if you're looking to experience the whole game.The fact that there are still a lot of servers up is a good sign. (At least there was a whole page of them around 1900 CST, with most of them having people in them!)Thank you for taking the time to read my review, Atratzu signing off.			"

Graphics and sounds are amazing as always, gameplay is quick and engaging, there are a lot of interesting and varied weapons, vehicles and maps. However, when compared to the older games in the series it doesn't seem to be the best. When it comes to Warfare/Onslaught (same mode, differently called in UT3 and UT2004), then UT2004 seems to be the best as the gameplay is better thought-through and generally maps seem to be better too. It also feels like the developers went too far with vehicles in this mode in UT3, and in consequence there is just too many kinds of them where some don't even seem very useful. When it comes to Deathmatch/Team Deathmatch or Capture the Flag, then the first Unreal Tournament still remains the best up to this day, in my opinion. It has the most solid gameplay in DM/TDM/CtF and no other game in the series ever came close to it. Do I recommend UT3? Sure, it's a great game in itself, however, even more I would recommend the first UT or UT2004 (depending on what game modes you want to play). Still, even if you own the older games in the series you still might want to get UT3 on a sale just to check it out, at least to play on some different maps than you usually do.			"

												This is like the dumbed down version of Unreal Tournament 2004. Improved graphics, but less game modes, less weapons, less everything. It's more of a tech demo than a proper game, but it's cheap as chips to purchase so it's not the worst deal out there, it just should've been much more.Full video review:

												I bought a boxed copy of this game from Amazon on the day it was released around 9 years ago. Since then I've played literally thousands of hours of UT3 and have just over 4 million kills to my name. For sure there are better UT players than me out there, but few have as much experience.In many ways UT3 was and is the purest on-line 'traditional' (i.e. not a military game like Battlefield or ARMA) FPS experience ever brought to the PC. The graphics, sound and general game play still look good today and hold up relatively well against the likes of the recently released Doom and other such games.UT3 features a decent number of game modes, a good pile of maps and all your favourite staple Unreal weapons, some of which date all the way back to the original Unreal circa 1998. All in all plenty of content to play with. All that being said I find it difficult to recommend this game. Why? Since GameSpy closed their doors the on-line community has collapsed and it's now nearly impossible to find and take part in anything other than LAN games.The second issue is that due to the age of the game, the nearly limitless number of mods, maps and mutators that were common and easily available for UT3 are now becoming very difficult to find as various hosting sites have long since gone off-line.I'd absolutely recommend this game for solo play as the AI is decent and there's even a passable single player campaign. If however you purchase UT3 thinking you'll easily be able to jump in to on-line games you'll be in for an unpleasant shock as this has now become nearly impossible.So a guarded recommendation. If you enjoyed past UT games and somehow missed out on UT3, or if you had a non-steam version and want to add it to your collection then I'd unhesitatingly recommend it as it's so much fun. As a pure on-line experience (there really isn't one any more) it's difficult to recommend by now.For anyone who doesn't know, there is now a free to play UT4 available directly from Epic Games, though personally I dislike it intensely as they've completely borked the weapons balance, but that's another discussion for another time...

												This game is one of the best multiplayer shooters ever made (besides UT2004 of course). UT3 is very fast paced compared to other first person shooters. Players have the ability to dodge and wall dodge in order to move even more faster & to avoid being hit by enemies. Players don't have to worry about reloading their weapon either. Some servers may require you to pick up more ammo or weapons & some just have an unlimited ammo supply, but there is no need for hitting a reload key like in other first person shooters.Servers & mods- Different servers have a variety of mods and maps. If mods aren't your thing you can join one of the official servers and play there instead. I personally love the mods though since it makes the experience more worthwhile with better weapons & being able to level up weapon damage and health. Game type- I appreciate Greed which makes UT3 different from other Unreal games in a way. It may be said that Greed is similar to Bombing Run due to the ""hoop"" that one has to go through in order to score but they obviously aren't the exact same. In Greed, there are two teams (red and blue), the objective is to capture as many skulls as possible by killing enemies and score them at the enemy base. Even though not many people play anymore this will still be one of my favorites and I will keep going back to it just for fun. I really can't stop playing because it brings back good memories with my old clan members and the game nights we use to have every few weekends. Some of the best people I ever met were from UT! (My time in game on here isn't even close to how much time I've actually played since I used the CD version for years before the steam version.) I've been playing the Unreal series since 2004.			"

												This game was my chillhood (2010-2016). On January 2010 I got it for my birthday from my classmate and I was so happy to have it. Before this game I played UT2004 or UT1999, another two awesome games. When I first saw trailer in 2008 I was so shocked how this game was improved and the new dark side added Necris, also the Necris Darkwalker reminded me of that machine from War Of The Worlds 2005 called Tripod, it was similiar but not the same and it was and it still is my favorite first vehicle from UT3. I had so much cheats, mods, mutators, maps... even I think I had more than 6,000 hours on it. But one day I lost my CD/DVD which was UT3 on. So after half of year later I found it here on Steam. And I instantly bought Unreal Deal Pack with all UT games on it. Even now its like old times when I first started to play it. I play it today too but not quite a lot since I found new games which are better but I heard that a new Unreal Tournament is in development and I think you can play since its still early alpha game on Epic Games site but in the future it will evolve making it the best Unreal Tournament ever created :)If you played UT2004 or Ut1999 then you must have UT3 right now, if you have it then nice :D "

												It's a fun first person shooter. Lots of weapons, vehicles, gametypes, and maps will keep you busy for a long time.Unfortunately, as the game came out in 2007 there isn't much of a multiplayer community left.The single player game pits you against bots. One of the main complaints about previous Unreal Tournament games is that there was basically no story or plot. So this time the developers came up with a plot complete with flashy cutscenes about how the Necris destroyed your colony and you're out for revenge. Some of it was a bit contrived -- Capture the Flag in a warzone? Yep, they have a technobabble explanation for it! But overall the addition of a storyline was appreciated and helped to elevate this game's single player mode over its predecessors.My main complaint about the bots is they have trouble with vehicle pathfinding sometimes. You'll see them stuck in traffic jams from time to time.And there's one mission in particular I should warn you about.  At the end of Chapter 2 there's a mission where the enemy team has a bunch of vehicles but you only have one. The catch is that one vehicle is a Leviathon, the most powerful vehicle in the game. The obvious idea is that you take the Leviathon and wreck the other team's vehicles.The execution of that idea fails because your bot teammates will hop into the Leviathon, which is the hardest to drive out of all the vehicles, and immediately get stuck inside your base. So not only do you not have your super vehicle, you don't have most of your team either, making this mission by far the hardest in the game (and it happens fairly early in the game too). I was eventually able to beat it by using my best card, which is like pre-mission buff you can earn.The game may have come out in 2007 but the graphics are still good by the standards of 2016. The music was unobtrusive and mostly forgettable.The gunplay is fantastic. The various mutators you can use with the maps add a lot of fun. For example, there's a ""Titan"" mutator that can make your character grow to the size of a giant if you're successful. This gives you extra health and firepower, but slows down your speed and possibly restricts you to certain areas of the map.In my opinion, this is the best game out of the Unreal Tournament series. If you like first person shooters you'll like Unreal Tournament 3.			"

												If you are a person like myself who prefers to only play your games in singleplayer mode but have always wanted a honest multiplayer experience then look no further you have found the perfect game.1.Everybot on the team is in it for themselves2.Everytime they die they have a rage fit3.Your own bot team mocks you4.The enemy bot team mocks you5.The bots state how great they are then they die from not paying attention6.When teamwork is required you can give them orders all you want they wont listen and they will blame you for their loss7.Everytime you depend on a bot team member they will always be the first one shot8.Your team members find it more entertaining to ride vehicles then providing you covering fire9.They dont know the concept of ""useful"" reinforcements10.If you turn on friendly fire your own team will start a civil war11.Somehow the other team knows how to systematically win on every warfare map (sometimes)12.The bots will state that my number 11. tip is your fault XD13.Apparently every bot on your team breaks their leg no matter what kind of death/injury it isSeriously this game is great and incredibly comical fun and a almost unbelivable multiplayer feeling the only thing its missing is recorded audio files of people cussing at you in russian and young kids saying that they have sexual entercourse with your mother and you wouldnt even know your playing singleplayer10/10 Will scream at my uncooperative team of virtual bots again for not following my pro orders			"

												UT3 is a brilliant game with plenty of reply value. The variety of game options and maps can be tailored to your pleasure. The Unreal graphics engine is reliable for smooth gameplay and crisp graphics. The game has a great selection of weapons and vehicles are available at your disposal. The main single player campaign may be overshadowed by the Multiplayer or Singleplayer w/bots as it can be considered more competitive. There are plenty of difficulty modes and the A.I is exceptionally challenging on the higher modes. Overall an incredible game with amazing gameplay,graphics and a kick♥♥♥♥♥soundtrack. 90%			"

												Having been immensly dissapointed with the DOOM Open Beta, I felt the need to quench my arena shooter thirst, and good God did I pick the right game to do so. Unreal Torny 3 has some SERIOUSLY jaw dropping visuals, that have aged AMAZINGLY. On top of that, it's fast paced, well balanced gameplay, with TONS of fantastic weapons and pickups, make this one of the best multiplayer shooting values ever. The number of maps, weapons, options, modifers, and user mods kinda took me aback. Modern titles would NEVER provide this much gameplay variation without the ol ""DLC"" train blowing its horn. One of my favorite part of ANY Unreal game is the announcer, and he delivers! The Unreal announcer is bigger and better than ever, with lines like ""headshot"" still getting me AMPED the hell up to this day.To be honest, $20 is a bit steep for a game this old, but it's honestly worth EVERY penny! Get some friends on board, and get ready for an ABSOLUTE blast!			"

												This is probably one of the best games I have ever purchased, on any platform, ever. I'm a die-hard UT fan from the original (1999) and this one knocks it out of the park for me.I can't claim to fully understand all of the game as of yet, I'm only getting into the campaigns, but from what I can tell, it's a winner all around. The graphics are very nicely done, it's super fast (in UT fashion, of course, UT has always been fast), the audio is great.This game may be several years old and lots of other games have a bigger following than this, but you can't go wrong with this one. Especially if you have ever enjoyed a UT game in the past. Two huge thumbs up here.			"

Steam achievements are available (obviously) for those whom value the service and pretty good community support adds up to a fairly justifiable $5 purchase.Ultimately, it's fun and that's enough when you want an FPS arena kill joy fix because puzzles and racers have knawed your brains to fray.

												The problem with this game is that the game is good, and it's just dead. It has an amazing engine, awesome gameplay, I came from having 2k+ hours in UT99 messed around with 2k3, 2k4 a little bit but all and all this game felt more like the original in the short time I've played it. The community however is dead, it's literally like 20 people spread out over 10k servers at peak hours. Which is crazy considering this is so much better than 2k4 on basically every single level. The perfect example of a game that should have got more love than it did but just didn't. What's worse now is that the creators are going to aim for more of a 2k4 experience  with UT4 when they should be aiming for more of a UT3 experience because they actually got it right. The player base is just clearly mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for not switching over to the blatantly superior game. I don't even know weather or not to recommend this game because it's actually an amazing game, or to not recommend it because of it's sheer lack of players. Game is dead, but it's amazing.			"

												As a massive fan of the unreal franchise I found this to be a great sequel. Still never beats the classics but the graphics and weapons are amazing! the different characters designs are also pretty awesome. It reminds me a lot of ut2004 in the gameplay and weapon designs are very similar. One thing I miss from the original 1999 or GOTY edition is the addition to customize the bots to your content. But the bots are a lot more detailed. So far I've only been playing insant action so I'm not 100% sure about the campaign. However, for someone like myself who prefers to get straight into the gameplay I would reccomend instant action. This game is pretty cheap for the graphics and details. I would reccomend this to anyone that likes sci-fi fps's and some amazing maps. Also Vehicle CTF is pretty cool too!			"

												I came to UT3 after being a big fan of the original, 16-year old UT. Never really played UT 2003/2004 aside from the demos which I didn't really like.Let's face it, UT3 is fun. It keeps the feel of the original UT but with a boatload of fun new stuff, such as vehicle combat which I don't really do very much, but I might in the future. And they remade some of my old favorite maps, which is another large plus.Another thing that's nice about this is that my mediocre GT440 video card and 1 gig of RAM seem to run it at a perfectly playable 30+ FPS at high settings, so you get nice graphics on a relatively low end setup.7/10 because I miss the original Facing Worlds. I'm sure there's a mod for that though.			"

												I've played this to death, and would recommend it to anyone who's interested in a futuristic FPS in single-player mode. My favourite experience was shooting someone in the air with a rocket while I was jumping under a bridge, and then having their giblets fall around me on either side of the bridge. Can't do that in Counterstrike!Sadly, setting up multiplayer is hard and buggy, the gameplay is amateurish (as in, not tuned for competitive play), the story is almost non-existent, and the game was never a community success, so it's mostly playing against bots.

												UT3 by Epic Games is the fourth game in the Unreal Tournament series and the eigth Unreal game. It runs on their Unreal 3 engine (hence the name) and it looks stunning. The gameplay is tight, the graphics are beautiful and the physics and particle (and gore) effects are amazing. Even though it's five years old the graphics can be tweaked to insane amounts and although it runs at a good framerate on my mid-range hardware if I were to max this baby out it would really push my system to the limits. If you're a fan of Unreal Tournament you'll probably enjoy this game for what it is but it does a few things differently than its predecessors that may annoy you. For one, UT3 focuses heavily on vehicle based combat. Now, I'm a big UT'99 fan and I felt it was possibly the most pure shooter experience I've ever had the joy of playing and it didn't need gimicks like fancy ships, hoverboards (seriously, you get a hoverboard to fly around on on bigger maps), and giant maps to be a great arena shooter. All you needed was running, and gunning. Now, that's not saying that UT3 lacks this, it certainly has smaller maps without hoverboards where you fly around and blast people to bloody bits just like the older games but it does have new mechanics you may like or dislike, such as the ability to ""play dead"" and fall down, which I found to be distracting, and a handy floating arrow that shows you where to go in CTF and Warfare modes (it's not obtrusive, trust me). The level design is also incredibly well done, with fun things to play with like different physics and rainfall and hazards and difficult to reach powerups. Unfortunately, this game lacks the assault game type which I found to be a lot of fun in UT'99, and the emphasis that UT3 places on the Warfare gametype during the campaign I found to be draining as the maps were just too large. I felt like I was playing Battlefield or something, with everyone flying or driving something accross a huge distance to complete some type of objective. But I digress. Basically what I'm trying to say that although this game has its merits and can stand on them, it's not as good or as fun to play as the games that preceeded it. It's a lot of fun and is good for LAN and online play and even though the graphics are amazing I think I'd still rather play UT'99. Your mileage may vary, however, and I'd still recommend this game as it's a fun shooter and is a member of a series that I think is at the front of the pack in the arena combat scene. Oh, and it comes with the UDK and Unreal Tournament 3 Editor and has great MOD support, so there's hours of fun outside of what comes in the box.Pros:Stunning VisualsTight GameplayGreat Music/AudioMOD SupportHas the Sniper Rifle! (Lightning Gun sucks.)Cons:A lot of focus on vehicular combatSome detrimental changes to UT gameplay and stylingGame felt more like a showroom for the Unreal 3 engine than a UT series gameNo Assault game typeSo-So Controller Support (I don't know what the ""E"" button is on my control pad)It's hard to enhance on near perfection and any changes you make to a beloved series is going to have some fallout and I appreciate the effort here. It wasn't a colossal failure like Diablo 3 was but it just didn't wow me like the previous UT games did. It was fun and it wasn't bad but if I'm playing some UT Deathmatch I'm probably not playing this game over the others. I'd say give it a shot and play it to see if it's your thing because the larger maps and new focus on vehicular combat may be something you enjoy a lot. Oh yeah, there also was a story (it didn't focus on the ""tournament"" though). I didn't really talk about it as it's not super important in a UT game but it was mediocre and had some cool moments. Good effort team, it certainly didn't detract anything from the game, I just didn't really care about it much. TL;DR nothing gets your heart pumping like Unreal Tournament - although it's not my favorite of the series it scratched an itch that hadn't been touched in years. B+			"

												I’ve been playing Unreal Tournament since the 1st edition. The good old classic UT99GOTY later was UT2003 then UT2004. In this edition some features were removed that existed in the older UT series like Assault, which was very popular and interesting game type. However there was an improved on the Onslaught game type idea that was introduced in UT2004 and transformed it to game type called Warfare in UT3, also added some sort of single player campaign which is not too bad, the single player campaign was also available in the old UT99GOTY but was presented in a more simplistic manner.The downfalls are that the game isn’t supported much by modding community anymore especially if you compare it to the old UT99GOTY.  The other thing is lack of players. However, you can still make your own server and play with bots or have a LAN party with friends. If to speak about UT3 Black Edition as a whole is defiantly something worth trying.I personally would recommend any UT series to try, because this is not a game it’s a legend!			"

												If the game is on sale, 75% or more, and you got no one who owns the game to play with, purchase 2 or more copies and gift it to some friends and go have a blast!This game is one of the most entertaining Arcade FPS shooters around and has a fun and interesting campain. If you like LAN gaming, this is one of those games which will keep you hooked, coming back for more and more.One of the coolest features of this game is the ability for adding community based content. I recall long ago downloading a Samus Aran module and shooting the heck out of other players online. Ah---- the memories.To this day I still play this off/on - mostly offline since it is so fun in LAN mode.Again, go snag the game and buy some for your friends if they refuse to dish out one meal's worth of cash on this game. This game lasts a lot longer than paying for thieir dinners anyways - and at least you can be sure they'll thank you for this ;)			"

												Years and years of satisfaction with this one.I was addicted on the Unreal Tournament 99 GOTY, but when the Unreal Tournament 3 came out, I did nothing but playing it over and over again.Pros:Engine, obviously, the best FPS engine in my opinion.Game modes that can be really fun on single player mode too.Instant Action mode. Are you looking for some adrenaline and can't wait for the cutscenes and all the story of the game show up until you can finally shoot some heads off? That's your game mode then!The Bots are really fast if you want it. Very smart if you want it. They make you feel like a little baby trying to play the game if you want it! But they can be very stupid if you want it too. [There's a big variety of configurations that you can apply to the game before entering the action.]The graphics are very good. Not to argue about. And looks pretty modern even after so many years.Sound effects and music not so addictive like the UT99 ones, but close enough to make you feel fine.Cons:The Campaign looks boring if you don't like some of the game modes. But you can always go to the Instant Action mode. It gives the game the replay factor that every FPS should give.The Multiplayer mode is dead. (It's not because there are no people playing this game anymore, but Epic Games just has unplugged the servers after years and years of service. There are a mod somewhere that allows you to play in that mode if you want to search for it) But back in time, when you could play this mode, the number of custom servers with tons of custom maps and mods to download were so big that the wait until all the stuff to be downloaded and you finally enter the server was so absurd that you were disencouraged to play there anyway.It's a game that came out before the Steam, so there are more players with versions of the game out of here than the Steam players (but if you really want to play with friends in multiplayer mode, the mod that allow this, allows you to enjoy the game with all the people around the world too ;) )9/10			"

												All I really have to say is that when you're going for mod content, UT3 has a fraction of the material other games in the series has. Avoid Skaa3w models, because they're pretty bad ports that have horrible readmes and look like they're slathered in crisco. The Aviana and Demonus models are really high quality, although they don't match the game's visual style much. The Community Bonus content is alright. Classic Maps Megapack is a must--lots of them are better than the default maps. If you like Runestorm's work (they're the ones who did all of the official Ballistic Weapons content for 2k4 before the community took over) you should check out their Crucible weapon pack, although lots of people complain about game-breaking bugs.That's pretty much it. I wish there were more content, but I guess that's why model rip software exists.			"

												Hardcore Fast Action First Person Shooter, in this game you really need move your♥♥♥♥♥and fast reaction skills your you will die. The story of campain sucks, its a kind excuse to make a presentation of game modes and gameplay.This game its kind focus on multiplayer but the bots do also a nice job they are pretty challanging. If played the old unreal tournament games and never tried this one, you should think really about buy it. PS: if you did brough the retail version you can add to steam, just put the serial code on active product section.			"

												Unreal Tournament 3 is one of if not the best Deathmatch games i ever played.For me a good deathmatch game is all about the gunplay and games. Unreal Tournament is a master of both!The guns are balanced in a way that they are not overpowered in any way (Especially with the no super weapons mutator). A highly skilled player could easily take someone out with a better gun if they lack in skill.Gamemode wise there is a variety of fun modes for everyone from the big Warfare where you destroy the other teams nodes and that includes vehicles from classics such as CTF to my personal favorite betrayal. It is mainly betrayal that makes this game stand out for me above the older unreal games (UT2004 has a Betrayal mod by the community if your intrested). It is a (T)DM hybrid with InstaGib (1HitKill) weapons. You frag others to gain points and also raise the team pot. Kill your oponent to still this pot and he has a limited time to get back to you. This brings for very fun balanced and also pleasently frustrating moments.			"

												Introduction: This has been one of mine favorite video game franchises ever since I played Unreal Tournament 2004! And coming to this one I wouldn't say everything is great about this as compared to UT2K4 especially the movement and gravity though it can be fixed with mods but besides that there are many new games modes like Greed, Betrayal and the improved Onslaught mode from UT2K4 called Warfare which is my favorite as its relatively more balanced now. I didn't like the Titan mutator much but then again it can be turned off.The amount of community made mods, maps and other stuff is big though not as big as UT2K4.Weapons: The shield gun has been replaced with the Impact Hammer from the original UT and all other weapons have been modified in some way or the other which is a mixed bag in my opinion. Translocator is also still there for non vehicular combat game modes.Vehicles: With the inclusion of the new Necris faction in to the Unreal Tournament universe there are several new vehicles on top of those which already existed in UT2K4 so I can't describe all of them in detail here because I initially wanted to as each and every vehicle is fun to use! So if you get the game just jump in to Vehicle Capture The Flag or Warfare and try them out yourself! Besides this a new Translocator alternative called the Hoverboard has been added for vehicular combat game modes.Campaign: Even though I have played all the Unreal Tournament games I'm not a that big fan of its storyline so I didn't expect much from this ones Campaign either as its boring with only a few cutscenes. Though if you have a friend then I would suggest playing Co Op on the Insane difficulty mode! You can add me as well if you want to play Co Op!Multiplayer: Since the new Unreal Tournament has been in development which is currently in Beta as of now the Multiplayer community has been mostly dead so at this point of time it is a little hard even for a big fan of this series like me to blindly recommend this for Multiplayer which is one of the strongest point of this game. Mostly you will find bots on the servers though you can find some dedicated players occassionally. Conclusion: Overall in short you can consider this game during a sale if you haven't played a fast paced First Person Shooter in a while which relies on a lot of things like skills, reflexes, strategy and team work depending on the game mode. There aren't any locked content except character visual customization so you have everything available from the start for an instant action!			"

												(Re-doing my review since my last one really sucked since I wrote it at 3AM tired lol)Unreal Tournament 3 is a solid game, with great graphics and gameplay. I recommend this if you don't think about the older Unreal games, because to me this game doesn't feel like an Unreal sequel. I'm of course basing this opinion off of a bias of nostalgia because whenever I play UT3 or 2004, I always think about happy memories and the feel of the original Unreal Tournament; which I really try not to, but do. It's a real mix in between, there is an element of the game feeling like Unreal with it's fast pace gameplay, and original weapons and lines being in there, but it still is difficult to enjoy for me personally.

												As a fan of slow paced tactical shooters, I have to say this game can appeal to a lot of people. The gameplay is straight forward, and all weapons are easy to use.The art style matches the gameplay, as a super action sci-fi style movie setting. Any other setting for it is stupid. The characters are joking and colorful... most of them, anyway. Bishop's lines are the best. So if you're that kind of person who pays attention to atmosphere, it doesn't fail here.When it comes to gameplay, imagine the gunplay of Quake combined with the vehicles of Halo. Nothing much to say here. There are basic Source-inspired movement techniques, such as jumping with weapons and bunny hopping. There are many ways to play, but I categorize them based off their representatives from the Campaign. For example, as I'm used to games where headshots are important, I would be Bishop. Vehicles are of the standard selection: buggies, hover planes, tanks, and a heavier buggy. However, all these vehicles differ from their standard Halo inspirations. For example, the buggy has fold-out blades on the front bumper. Yeah. There are no overpowered weapons or vehicles, but I have to say that the Bio Rifle does a bit too much damage for a gun found right outside of spawn.The creator tool is a creator tool using the same engine as the game. Not much to say.TL;DR, It's a good arena game that tops even Half-Life 2 Deathmatch. Gameplay is fluid, art style actually makes sense, so get it if you don't suck at shooters. EDIT: The Free To Play Unreal Tournament currently outclasses this game in the modes it has, however, it doesn't have vehicles or hoverboards yet. Also no Warfare. So get this if you need to catch up on the series or are extremely impatient.			"

												Awesome game! Grew up with unreal tournament, quake and doom. Such a fun game! But there is a few things that i didnt like about it, and that was the singleplayer mode. When playing by yourself, i would be advise about the friendly AI. IMO they are horrible :/. When giving a order, they will say ""Acknowledge"" and in your mind they are not going to follow that order. They will KOS enemies very good. But playing the objectives and following orders is not that great for them. But overall such a fun game. You should go buy it :)			"

												While it's certainly not the best in the series, Unreal Tournament 3 is certainly a worthy member of it. It has a sort of back-to-basics approach in the weapon selection and non-vehicle game modes, and the vehicles themselves are actually well-implemented and fun to play with. The maps are well designed, the gameplay's definitely still Unreal Tournament, and the graphics are outstanding (especially considering the great performance!). Only major problem is the singleplayer campaign, which replaced the Tournament with a war... in other words, the campaign's simply stupid. Apart from that, it's a fun game.			"

												Back in 2007 Unreal Tournament 3 used to be what put 'Epic"" in the ""Epic Games"". Explosive mixture of powerful weapons, lots of maps and vehicles with an amazing game pace as a topping. Perhaps the looks do not shine anymore as they did on game's release but for a 9 year old game it still looks extremely well. In regards to gameplay UT 3 is a nearly perfect experience. Starting from a wide choice of weapons most of them having secondary fire mode completely different from the basic one. Some of them even having a tretiary one. Lasers, bullets, plasma and rockets and a personal nuke launcher. This game has it all. Or rather used to have.Vast array of vehicles deserves similar recognition. Divided into two factions: Necris and Izanagi they offer unique approach both in design and function in each vehicle ""class"". Thus making them balanced while being much different in playstyle. Despite the fact that there were plenty maps on the game release there is an option to upload custom maps and mods to each server. There were also plenty of game modes avialable. From shooting classics like Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag there is a twist of Vehicle Capture Flag and Warfare - the biggest game mode utilizing both infantry and vehicles to the full extent. Many of the maps including unique mechanics and side goals to aid defeat of the enemy. As if things weren't exciting enough already every game mode possesed mutators allowing to differ the gameplay even further. All of the above got a finishing touch in 2009's Titan Pack update adding content unreleased in base game as well as classic game modes - Greed and Betrayal.This heavily mutiplayer-oriented title comes with a really long campaign although it's basically a series of bot matches with a pinch of lore divided into 5 acts. Each finished with a nice cinematic. Single is a good opportunity to get a feel of map roster before leaping into mutiplayer but nothing else. Unless played on highest diffculty - bots there are barely fair forcing the player to push their skill to the limits.For such a gem it's somewhat sad how empty the game is today. This is the reason why I would only reccomend the Unreal Tournament 3 to the franchise fans - there is simply hardly anyone left to play with. Meaning you will either face bots (even in few mutiplayer servers left) or battle-hardned veterans. It's nice to experience the ridiculous pace of the game that is hardly matched by any modern title. But it is a nostalgic memory that along with UT 3 belongs in the past.			"

												Played this game for more than a thousand hours pre steam, many all-nighters and still play regularly many years later. It's always a good time, and you can't go wrong. My first PC build was to get better graphics from this game, and it still looks great today IMO. There are many mods and maps, and I've even made some maps with the toolkit which makes it an even better experience. I wasn't really excited about the story aspect, at first. Traditionally the Unreal series is a story game like unreal, or unreal 2, and in between those the Unreal Tournament games. There wasn't any tournament in UTIII, but it still stands out as one of my all time favorite games. All modern FPS owe their lives to the Unreal series, and if you haven't experienced them you should. I would recommend buying the Unreal Deal and playing Unreal, UT99, Unreal 2, UT2004, Then UT III.			"

												Don't get me wrong i actually do like this game. I remember playing this online back in day on ps3 like 2008 or so. I had tons of fun with it back then. So why do i not recommend it? In short near dead community.its so dead, the  ps3 version (before online shutdown of gamespy) had more life  than this game today. hell UT2004 today even has more of community than UT3. So today, this game can now only fall back on single player which even back then i didn't really like. found it pretty boring. Even at occasional sale price of $10 its not worth it. If you could get as cheap like i did($3) go for it, you can occasionally find online matches and could mess around with bot matches. But for $10 price range you can find games on steam with lot more content than this game nowadays. Do yourself a favor and get either UT2004 or try free pre-alpha for next unreal game UT4 which is shaping to be pretty good from my experience with it. "

												{This review will be based on the singleplayer mode of this game.}Unreal Tournament 3. Hmm what to say, what to say... Most of the fans were for strange reasons disappointed of this game. But in my sight (That just for some reason is in love of underated stuffs,) I enjoy this game. 'Tis sad it got a low amount of users playing online, but in there the game is quite intense, unlike with bots. And by the way: Speaking of bots, some of them may be strangely made. Especially in Campaign, which is mostly just made out of low-skilled bots with the constant 'warfare' mode. And this review will be mostly, based on that.---Unlike the single players of the previous Unreal Tournament games, there is a special story in it, with (I think) the whole campaign being played with you and your teammates, bots, in missions. There are no actual tournaments and this feeling of arena that was from previous games, but constant war. Without any spoilers, I will just describe the game inside it;From the start you play on with flags with your small team and the enemy team, that actually know how to use 'translocators' pretty well. But of course, too novice. Sadly the whole continuity of the single player is made out of novice bots. Even your teammates achieve no skill in progress, seriously. Only enemies get to...evolve. But by a little bit. I was disappointed that the parody-race of Skaarj were not as monstrous as they looked.The gameplay itself with the story goes on solid. Through the missions with flags you then get to complete them in more complex maps, then to the cores with vehicles and prime nodes, and so on for a long time. Sometimes you may get an extra mission, however. It is truly a good feeling when you get back to the deathmatches from these time-consuming warfares.And later of the game, of course, gets strangely hard. I say strangely because even your epic skills in gaming may not always help your stubborn teammates that cannot even protect the nodes correctly. But thankfully, you got a fuction close to the 'Taunt' and 'Status' section called 'Orders,' since you are a leader and all. It does benefit you a little. Most of the time just do 'Defend' for all the teammates not to get molested by the incoming horde of smarter attacking bots.But overall...I played this campaign when my internet was out. For some reason I was just, entertained by it. Even with slightly funny way of this game being made, I was digged in a little. Because of my boredom and because of my love to the look of this game, and the whole love to the UT series. Not to look at the negatives of the game, when you imagine it all, more lively of a game, like a movie, it is enjoyable. Though not for the users who seek for an excellent game.			"

												This game is, without a doubt, amazing! I could rattle on about it, so instead, here's a list of rpos and cons:Pros-- Game pace is fast and brilliant-- The AI (bots) are well programmed but, as usual, teamwork is a lot harder (if not impossible) with bots, so sometimes you have to work around them to get something done. This isn't always a bad thing because it can make the game very interesting.-- The variety of weapons is good and, in my experience, aren't quite as easy to learn to use well as you might expect. This is not CoD, so becoming proficient with a weapon actually takes practice.-- The vehicles are fun and well done. The only one I have a problem with is the tank because if you have someone with have a brain operating the turrent, you really do need your whole team to be able to kill it. But this is probably me being too picky.--The way all the elements of the game fit together forms a game which is truely amazing.Cons-- Even though there is a story, playing the maps (at least the first few) doesn't really make it feel like there is. All the objectives I've played so far are all TDM, CTF, CTF with vehicles, etc and it doesn't feel very story-like.-- It may be the comuter me and my mates have, it might not, but we did run into a few issues when joining each others games on lane. But we'd still be able to join 6 or 7 times out of 10, so it's not enough to be bothered by, but enough to annoy you a little.Other Comments-- This game is very reminiscent of Gears of War in the way things look. This is neither a pro nor con, but is cool if you loved and played any of the Gears of War franchise.Overall, this game is bloody amazing and would highly recommend!My score : 8/10			"

The developers put minimal new content into it, basically updated the graphics engine and said to the modding community ""you do the rest"".

But this is probably me being too picky.--The way all the elements of the game fit together forms a game which is truely amazing.Cons-- Even though there is a story, playing the maps (at least the first few) doesn't really make it feel like there is. All the objectives I've played so far are all TDM, CTF, CTF with vehicles, etc and it doesn't feel very story-like.-- It may be the comuter me and my mates have, it might not, but we did run into a few issues when joining each others games on lane. But we'd still be able to join 6 or 7 times out of 10, so it's not enough to be bothered by, but enough to annoy you a little.Other Comments-- This game is very reminiscent of Gears of War in the way things look. This is neither a pro nor con, but is cool if you loved and played any of the Gears of War franchise.Overall, this game is bloody amazing and would highly recommend!My score : 8/10			"

												Серия Unreal Tournament всегда славилась балансом, динамикой и яркостью и конечно третья часть не исключение. По сравнению с предыдущей частью игра очень сильно прибавила в графике, стала на новенький и очень мощный движок Unreal Engine 3, и сразу покорила как заядлых фанатов серии, так и новопришедший геймеров.Что касается игрового процесса весь потенциал игры скрывается, или даже ждёт вас за кнопкой Multiplayer. Вся игра разделена на режимы -- Deathmatch (DM) Team Deathmatch (TDM), Capture the Flag (CTF), Vehicle Capture the Flag (VCTF), Duel, Warfare (Война), Greed (Жадность), Betrayal (Предательство). "

												The first real FPS shooter I ever picked up was the original ""Unreal Tournament"", and its legacy of violence and fast-paced gameplay lives in ""Unreal Tournament 3"". The developers took the best bits from the intervening titles like ""Unreal Tournament 2004"", and added some new content like Vehicle Warfare that completely changes the battlefield. One of the few games where the AI not only keeps up with the player, but actually surpasses them, which means that you can't get lazy and have to develop real hand-eye coordination to play at advanced difficulties.

												Ah, the good old days of arena shooters...A blast from the semi-recent past.My only complaints are that 1) My favorite weapon from UT99 was still sadly absent (RIP the Ripper) and 2) That Epic focuses on Gears of War, when I think that this game would be a better use of their time. That's strictly my opinion, though. I don't knock GOW, because it is a good franchise, but....but...Some have waited 9 years for another installment in this franchise. I myself, playing UT99 for the first time a year ago, can now roll with some of the people who haven't seen the light in fifteen years because they've been in their basement playing this game. Okay, I'm not a pro, but that doesn't stop me from wanting another one of these games. Not a whole lot of people play this game anymore… but that doesn’t stop it from being a great game. Unless the Halo games are rereleased for PC, this is probably what I'll be waiting for.Try turning the safety off. "

												I really wanted to like this game, but it's cons unfortunately outweigh the pros; it's impossible to find an unmodded game online, there is a lack of characters and levels, and the campaign is a massive waste of time. They also didn't include the beloved ""Assault"" game mode. The campaign's story is remarkably boring, and the worst part is they force you to play the ridiculous ""Onslaught"" levels which is a gimmicky mode in the first place, and the bot's AI is completely unreliable, making it almost impossible for me to progress on higher difficulties simply because my bots were not doing their jobs.In the original Unreal Tournament, playing the single player was fun because you could choose whichever game mode you felt like playing and work your way up the ladder, getting familiar with every single level so when you go online you're ready. There is a sense of completion as you go for nothing more than tournament glory. But in Unreal Tournament III you have to slog through a terrible and cliche story that isn't related to any tournament at all and you aren't given any choice which modes you want to train in. Even more frustrating is that the online mode is almost entirely unsupported. You have no stats, no functional matchmaking, and it's impossible to get you and your friends into the same game. They completely dropped the ball here. Other than that, the original core game is actually really fun. It's got that dark gritty Unreal feel, and it's super-gory so it's really satisfying when you get a kill. The best game mode is Deathmatch because it's the only one that actually represents what the game is supposed to be about in the first place: gladiatorial arena killing. But instead of adding the ""Assault"" game mode or supporting the ""Team Deathmatch"" and ""Capture The Flag"" modes with functional match-making, they did nothing here and just kept the ""Onslaught"" mode with the ridiculous vehicle combat that doesn't even feel like a tournament fighter anymore. It's just some vehicle gimmick they added ever since Halo came out.Just skip this one. The original Unreal Tournament is better in every single way except for the graphics, which are the only good thing I can say about this game. Don't get me wrong -- it's extremely fun to play for ten or fifteen minutes if you just want to kill some bots when you're bored, but beyond that I can say with confidence that this game offers nothing else worthwhile.

												Epic released a statistic that said 70% of the people who bought Unreal Tournament 2004 never played it online. Given how often I played offline with bots, I'd believe that. Unfortunately, UT3 introduces a laughably stupid singleplayer campaign that is more repetitive than it is fun or interesting. By trying to make a legitimate ""story mode"" for the game, they've sort of spoiled the fun of the original, because there's a lot of story stuff that gets in the way. There's still ways to do regular bot skirmishes, though, so it's not such a big problem.What is a big problem is that it's just not especially fun to play. The smaller maps feel too cramped and the larger maps get to be a little too large. Onslaught mode from UT2004 has been remade here as a retooled ""Warfare"" mode, and it's been changed for the worst. Players can now carry an orb around that lets them capture control points instantly without waiting, but instead of speeding the game up, all it does is make long, drawn out, tedious stalemates the norm, as teams fight over one or two nodes and instantly revert any progress made by the opposing team, over and over and over again. I've had Warfare matches go on for hours without much progress from either side, and enabling a time limit for rounds does little to alleviate the issue, as sudden death doesn't really mean anything when neither team's core is ever exposed.Plus, the guns just don't feel good. They feel meaty, sure, but something about them is... ""off"" in a way that's hard to describe.All this really made me do was re-install UT2004 and play that instead.			"

												I want to love Unreal Tournament 3, I really do. I want to love every Unreal game, but I can't.Epic dropped the ball when they made this smeary, bloom and brown, messy-looking sequel to one of the greatest deathmatch games of all time.The game feels like a console port, and Epic rewrote its narrative and visual style to be more like Gears of War than previous Unreal titles, and as such, it no longer feels unreal. It feels like just another dark and murky shooter, all style and no substance, and style is not a good thing to rely on in game that's supposed to be a competitive arena.			"

												Despite this beaing a great game I'd not recommend it, as it's really only worthwhile as a multiplayer game, yet the online service it installs with no longer exists, so you need to patch and do various other stuff just to get an online game, and to avoid the errors whilst trying to join a game - all this stuff should be included as standard, and it should all work from the Steam installation, otherwise Steam are just selling a disfunctional product and selling it on false pretences, apparently because they're too eager to take people's money and don't give a crap if their customers end up disappointed.Go to Epic games website and check out the currently free, modern version of the game, which is a work in progress, but at least you can get a multiplayer game withough any headaches.

A lot of snipers. Not unplayable, just a lot of snipers, with sniper rifles. My flak cannon is garbage against them. I still like it though, just need to get better.UPATE****** 2/2/2015Since I have picked this game back up my mind has changed. There are still very populated servers and tons of game modes.

												It's very good and very fantastical like good Unreal stuff always is and it seems to be lacking the support and community the previous UT games had. The game and software is very good but the online multiplayer as I remember had too long of wait times between tournaments, there was this never ending need to wait and reaffirm stuff and there was the repeating requests to join in again. That killed the spirit and killed the fun. Don't do that again Unreal! I hope the next Unreal does away with that rubbish and returns to the elements that made Unreal so successful and have such a massively huge and dedicated following online for multiplayer, mapping and modding. The game is awesome, the software stable and the online multiplayer worked great but that nagging and waiting killed all of it. Great game though and when you finally do get into a online multiplayer and have the patience to stay there through the constant waits and requests to rejoin you'll see the game and graphics are sweet as can be :)			"

												One of the best examples of twitch gaming using the impressive Unreal engine.A good variety of devastating weapons and excellent vehicle design all balanced against one another to ensure that the victor in any situation usually has a combination of a powerful weapon AND the greatest skill.Knowledge of the maps and their secrets will help ensure victory. It's a bit older now, but the UT series still has very solid gameplay despite aging graphic presentation.			"

												Maybe the worst game in the series. Looks nice, but the gameplay is kinda lame. It's fun for a couple of hours, most because of the unreal nostalgia experience. No one is playing this any longer on the internet. Probably more players in UT99, lol.So if you can get it under 5€, it can be worth playing. But remember, you will probably only be playing against bots.			"

My reaction to vehicles is mixed. They work, but I feel it doesn't fit the idea of a tournament, but as there is a different setting behind this game where you play as a soldier, this is excusable.Overall, it's fun to play and has all the grit and gore to make an over-the-top hype shooter.

												UT is back in it's 3rd (or would that be 4th, if you count the buried UT2003), installment in the series. While the graphics have been well overhalled, the AI is now a bit dated. They either ignore you, or stratigically frag your♥♥♥♥♥in the best way possible, making a gental lunch time quick game leaving you wanting to throw your keyboard and mouse away in frustration. The Singleplayer campain adds something new to the UT series, while all the excitment of the previous games is retained.Sadly the game is not without it's bugs (and bugs), and so logging into your account for online gameplay can leave you fragged.8/10			"

												I've been playing this game franchise since I was very young, and even before that I use to watch my father play it. I didnt get really into it untill UT3 came out. It is by far my favorite, not just because it is easier that its predecessors. The maps have expanded so much, and the user interface for the game has come a long way. The game missions as well as multiplayer remains capture the flag, and deathmatch/team deathmatch centered. They have also integrated new gamemodes which are refreshingly challenging. While the weapons have stayed the same name wise, they've gotten technologically better. Legendary guns like the Flak Cannon, still pack a punch, but look way more futuristic and alien like. I cant say as to wether a lot of people will feel the same about it as I do. It is a first person shooter, but the alien technology isnt for everyone. I've always described it similar to halo, but better in my opinion. Only way of finding out is giving it a go yourself!			"

UT3 is much more difficult on PC than xbox 360 (I have played both)So be prepared for hard difficulty, graphics are 10/10 for a game released in 2007OIne major issue is the online hosting, its a huge bug where everyone is having trouble hosting multiplayer games, so be on the lookout for that. There is a way to bypass this however, you need to download stunserver files in order to host.Overall 9.5/10			"

												UT is back in it's 3rd (or would that be 4th, if you count the buried UT2003), installment in the series. While the graphics have been well overhalled, the AI is now a bit dated. They either ignore you, or stratigically frag your♥♥♥♥♥in the best way possible, making a gental lunch time quick game leaving you wanting to throw your keyboard and mouse away in frustration. The Singleplayer campain adds something new to the UT series, while all the excitment of the previous games is retained.Sadly the game is not without it's bugs (and bugs), and so logging into your account for online gameplay can leave you fragged.8/10			"

												I have played untold hours of this game and never did I get bored of the pwnage you can deliver with the diverse weapons, the size of the maps, the vehicles, and most of all the massive amount of modding that this game has benefitted from. Being a single player nerd though, don't expect much of the campaign. But why would you when there's endless amounts of rockets you can fire into your opponent's face on multi?Definitely recommend this one			"

												I STRONGLY recommend this game, its even more action packed than UT99 and UT2004, with awesome graphics and action packed first person shooting action that deeply immerses you inside the game, it is worth buying it! Epic games, you are my favourite gaming company, i hope i'll work with you guys in the future. My childhood game was UT99 and i didnt regret having it, and when UT3 came in, i litterally excited, now, UT4 is comming in, and I AM PSYCHED TO DEATH for it! Epic games, keep up the good work, you have my support as a fan of the Unreal Tournament series!			"

												Funny thing: I bought this game way back near to the time it came out, as I was super hyped for it. Unreal Tournament has always been my favourite FPS series. Anyway, I got my copy as the regular edition of the game from a retail store. I never bothered registering the key on Steam until years later, as I think I tried it once, and, it didn't work. Then I tried it again, and... it did. Not only that, it gave me the Black Edition. I'm okay with this.Anyway. The game itself is pretty good. It's like a shinier, prettier UT 2004. I... don't really like it that much. The guns just feel all wrong. It's not a BAD game by anyone's standards. UT3 (which is a very stupid, VERY very stupid title, I mean, it's not the third Unreal game, it's not the third Unreal Tournament game, where did they get the number 3 from... just wtf) is a fantastic game in fact. It's just that I think UT 2004 is a bit better. UT3 doesn't really have many issues I don't think. It just doesn't feel right.Pick it up on sale, I guess, if you're really devoted to the series. I'm not sure the multiplayer isn't dead.Also, to address the title situation in more detail... lets see here. Unreal, then Unreal Tournament, then Unreal Tournament 2003, then Unreal II: The Awakening, then Unreal Tournament 2004, then Unreal Tournament 3.So... where do they get the 3 from? The third Unreal Tournament game was 2004. If it were Unreal 3, that would make it the third Unreal game. But it's not called that. It's called Unreal Tournament 3. What were they thinking? Seriously, I guess the fact this game actually has a campaign of sorts makes it a bit more of an Unreal 3, but at the same time... what?In Unreal, you're a prisoner who ends up crashed on a planet, you escape the dead vessel, and then you go out into the world to find a way off the planet, and in the process, rack up an insanely huge body count, tear through an alien temple, and destroy the mother of an evil alien race. Among other things. It's awesome, and crazy.In Unreal 2, you're a space marshal guy who does objective based missions in space. I don't really have much more to say about it. You hang out with your spaceship pals, learn some tragic pasts, get a whole pile of awesome guns, and massacre hundreds of mercs and aliens. Great stuff.Then... what, you're telling me this is meant to be Unreal 3? Is it? Maybe it is. The campaign feels tacked on, and as is usual with the Unreal Tournament series, it's still basically just Unreal Tournament matches, but the game puts tidbits of story in with things so it feels like an actual game.This ended up taking like half the review, but, hey, it needs to be asked, why? Is this Unreal 3, or Unreal Tournament 4? It can't be 3, that was done already. There wasn't even an Unreal Tournament 2, if you're not counting the two yearly games, 2003 and 2004. Which would make this Unreal Tournament 2. But that's nonsensical. I just don't see where they got 3 from. On top of this, Epic Games DID have a hand in all three of the previous games... I don't get it.But yeah, get Unreal Tournament... uh... 3. It's good!			"

												Killed a great franchise. Graphics are great, but number of maps, number of weapons, overall gameplay and number of game modes have all been reduced greatly from UT2004. Also, UT3 was given a proper storyline, which is not a bad thing in itself, but it was a poor effort that doesn't really make sense in the context of a tournament-style game. Sadly all the game modes that would have been sensible with the story such as assault (personal favourite) and bombing run have been ditched for this version. The thing that really killed it for me is that the main characters are clearly recycled from 'Gears of War 2' which was released around the same time. The graphical improvements made in UT3 are outweighed by the content lost, so I recommend not buying this game.			"

												This game is the best UT game so far. Installed UT4 two days ago to feel the difference, here's the comparison:UT4 is a cut version of UT3, looks worse, plays worse (9 years passed since the UT3 release). I think devs try to do exactly the same thing ID software did to Quake 3 and Quake Live.Ok, you can say it's because of alpha/pre-alpha/etc but who gives a ♥♥♥♥? It won't change much anyway.- no vehicles and hoverboards, that supposed to be better? Lol. They could just add an option to turn them off;- weapon design is worse (just look at the ♥♥♥♥ing sniper rifle, who designed this♥♥♥♥♥♥);- weapons don's shake while you fire them (hello Quake Live);- player models are MUCH worse (the only better part is the face) with thin and small arms and hands;- voice acting - ♥♥♥♥ing terrible (ok, you can say pre-alpha placeholders);- perfomance is much worse with almost the same graphics;- less game modes;Literally the only good thing about UT4 is the UT99 Facing Worlds map remake. I do not understand why people overrate it. Good thing EpicGames decided to publish UT4 only in their platform, it would be a ♥♥♥♥ing shame to publish it in Steam. "

												Despite some hate from Epic towards PC gamers and a bit too much of eyecandy, UT3 is a great addition to series (well, minus the Bombing run mode). Marvelous level design and smooth gameplay were always the trademark of Unreal Tournament series  and, by all means, you should give this one a go even if you're not the fan of anything post-UT99.Two minor flaws - AI in onslaught mode is very dumb and FOV is somewhat narrow. Everything else is just what you would expect from an Unreal game.			"

Really good game, but Epic Games didn't have to make this one look like Gears of War. 9/10. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"

												Another game I hate to see fall, Its a fun game but at the end of the day once you look at it after all of the hype has come to an end, its not that great. I really want to like this game, but I just can't. And I can't stand the blind Unreal Tournament fanbase saying that this is the best Unreal of all time, when in reality its probably one of the worst. To sum it all up, its a first person shooter multiplayer version of Gears of War (In my opinion one of the most overrated video game series in gaming) Unreal Tournament 3 is fun, don't get me wrong, but compared to Unreal Tournament 2003/2004 or the first Unreal Tournament, its no comparison. The single player is mixed bag, at times its great fun and addicting, and at other times is just frustrating. I really appreciate the attempt to add a story to the campaign, but this is also again where it falls flat. They tried to give you options on which battle you choose and said it would impact how you played the next match and they also added something called player cards you can collect to even or add an advantage, almost like an RPG. However choosing a certain battle over another never seem to do anything of importance in the next match, and the player cards to me are stupid addition. The whole point of the arena FPS was so everyone was on an even playing field and the fact that you need player cards to make the battle even or that can give yourself an advantage, goes against everything the Arena FPS stood for, an even playing field. But after all that it begins to get very repetative, the graphics are what most people complain about because they have a strange tinge of Brown in every map (even in cave and ice themed maps) and I can't believe no one has criticized the AI, THE AI IS ♥♥♥♥ING BRAIN DEAD!!!!! Why does Epic insist on using the same AI from 1999? and why do the Unreal Tournament fans choose to turn a blind eye to it every time? The AI are by far the most frustrating part of the whole game, Especially the friendly AI, because you can't give them orders, there were so many times in Vehicle CTF or Warfare maps when allies would pile into a Leviathan, (for those that don't know, has a very powerful secondary cannon on it, but to use it you have to anchor it to the ground and so it can't move) They will pile into it and just sit there and fire at enemies, leaving you and 1 other friendly AI to complete the whole mission, which is impossible since the other team have more players, because you don't have a player card to even the teams. My advice to Epic in the future Unreal Tournament games is simple, FIX THE DAMN AI!!!! Another strange addition is the Ord in Warfare. (What it does is, it capture nods instantly, and if you stand next to a already captured nod, it protects it from damage or capture) Now sometimes it works very well especially on maps with secondary points that hold a certain purpose, like the countdown nod in the mine map, that does damage to the enemy core without them needing to be linked or ones that can create heavy vehicles giving you a stronger push, however on other maps its frustrating and just makes some games go longer than they really need to.Multiplayer is also a mixed bag as well, at times its great, but most of the times its frustrating. This really pisses me off more than anything, because Unreal Tournament is known for its multiplayer, and in this game the single player campaign is more fun than playing multiplayer. Most of the multiplayer fanbase is populated by Unreal Tournament veterans, that essentially wipe the floor with all new players. Not to mention, finding a match in general is frustrating, sometimes you will look for a server and it says that it has 11/32 players on it, but when you finally get to play after it takes 10 minutes to load all of the stupid mods, you find that its completely populated by bots, and you completely wasted your time. The Shock Rifle is probably the worst weapon by far, for those that don't know you can fire the secondary fire, then shoot the ord you just fired with primary and it creates an huge explosion, this has been in unreal since the beginning, however in Unreal Tournament 3 the explosion is ever bigger than before, so now you die so easily, even if you have max armor and health, its even worse on small confined maps, most of the time you die from behind.At the end of the day Unreal Tournament 3 is not the best Epic could do, I hope that in the future Unreal Tournament games these problems do not persist, because Unreal is a great franchise. But in my opinion this game is not worth 19 dollars, don't buy this game unless you are an unreal addict			"

												I don't recommend this game, only in comparison to the previews entries to the series. This game attempts to bring the Unreal Tournament universe onto the war field, using ""Tournament rules"" in awkwards ways. You will find yourself 'Capturing the Flag' and 'Dominationing' in a futuristic war setting, which in my oppinion takes too much away from what used to make the game feel fun.Previous Unreal Tournaments were colorful, light hearted death tournaments with an exciting 'gameshow' feel, and although this game takes the manditory steps forward in the mud-like gritty ""realistic"" graphics, it takes too much away from what made the previous games so great.

												So, heads up, this game is a downer. If you've played the previous installments of UT and then decided to look at some reviews for it, HEAD MY WARNINGS. This is nothing like the previous installments just because it slaps a sticker that says that ""I'm legit! Buy Me!""Firstly, the game itself is a selling point. If you've played the series before and wanted something to look back to, this is not something you want. This is the rejected siamese brother to what this series is based on. Sure it has shooty shooty bang bang, but it also has a story that nobody really asked for... I don't see why this was necessary in the first place but whatever. It isn't really that good either. They looked like they were trying to go for something mixed between the Hot Wheels Acceleracers 'Big Foot' thing and CoD.Secondly, the weapons were completely revamped and not in the good way. Take my advice, the Flak Cannon shouldn't be used anymore. It's a load of crap. A few of the weapons were just nerfed to make it more ""Level for all weapons to deal correct damage"". That's not how it was meant to be played, some weapons were DESIGNED to be overkill, like the Flak Cannon or the Rocket Launcher. They decided to nerf them, sure there's blood and gore, but I believe there are mods to revamp damage to ""exposive"" levels again.Thirdly, the A.I. is bull. Now before you ask specifics, lemme explain. Either your team is as useless if not more than a steamy pile of bile mixed with burnt rubber, or the opposing team is as smart as a rocket scientist to know exactly where you are at all times. This is both good and bad. Good because it shows the A.I. is dedicating itself to taking out the most advanced player (i.e. you) and Bad because, again, your team is just useless. I wouldn't have them on my team anywhere... Not even a science project, lord knows they'd let me down there too. Aside from those points, they're just annoying overall. They now use voice actors to display what they're saying instead of typing or, y'know, shutting up and doing it. It's like they want the enemy to know ""HEY! GUESS WHAT?! WE'RE GONNA GO FOR THE EXPLOSVES! JUST LETTING YOU KNOW! OH AND GG MATES!""Finally, this game was the final game in the series. Disappointing as it may seem, the series took one faulty game and ended up dishing out this undeniable turn of events. Being as it's probably the only real disappointment in the Unreal Tournament series, you'd think they'd have made another one to make up for this error, sadly not. Both a gift and a curse if you think about it in the context of ""They won't make another game, but they won't make another craptastic Unreal Tournament"".So that pretty much sums up all I have to say about this game really.TL/DR: This game is like going to see Metallica live in concert and getting falsely advertised into a Justin Bieber marathon with the volume cranked to 11.

												(even though it says just a few minutes on record, I actually played much more, but it was retail non-Steam version)If you like old school online FPS, gameplay will likely suit you. It's pretty great. Never play campaign, though. The game is online shooter, I don't really know why they included campaign in the first place. Every UT game included one, though.Some people argue that UT2004 is better in terms of gameplay, but I believe it's a matter of taste. I have played and enjoyed both games.There's large assortiment of maps (both official and community-made, everything for free, no stupid DLCs), characters, and other mods. Some people even find enjoyment in trying various maps and mods with bots offline. As for me, playing offline is largely useless, but YMMV. It's pretty easy to mod the game, though it's the case for other UT games as well.Graphics is largely outdated, but so many years have passed since the release, and who cares, anyway? What I don't like is the style. It's dark, gloomy and overdetailed. I liked UT2004 more. Community-made HOLP map pack for this game has maps that better suit my taste.The soundtrack is great, but so-called dynamic music wasted it, in my opinion. I play with in-game music turned off, but sometimes listen to OST separately. What really ruined the game is lack of developer support. Although several patches were released that had addressed outright bugs (honestly, Valve games like TF2 faced much more disgraceful bugs during their lifetime), Epic Games never seemed to really care about this game. It's hard to tell what's exactly should've done about this, but for some reason TF2 is still alive and well, despite being released roughly at the same time and failing into the same niche of old school shooters. There's a lot of small issues that aren't exactly game-breaking, but still prevent from enjoying the game fully. Like fragile replay support (try to play a demo recorded on server with mods on), buggy dedicated server on Linux (and no client whatsoever), frequent issues with GameSpy middleware, technical issues with with custom gametypes (to be precise, cooking map made for custom gametype causes trouble if gametype is ever updated), lack of proper custom crosshair support, inability to switch to spectator from player, and a lot of other problems that were certainly mentioned on Epic Games forums multitude of times.As of now, game is almost dead. I do play it occasionally, you can find some players online, but still. If you like playing custom maps with bots, though, you still might enjoy it.			"

												I want to like this game, I really do, but I just can't.Having bought this game 3 times now (PS3, PC collectors' ed. and now Steam) and playing well over 100 hours across, as an arena shooter this game has some things going for it, but as a UT sequel and in light of the plethora of good team-arena shooters out there falls painfully short. First of all, one staple objective-driven gametype (assault) and another innovative football-like gametype introduced in UT2K4 (bombing run) have been axed entirely. Warfare (formerly onslaught) has undergone a number of questionable design choices (insta-capture orbs) which altar game flow dramatically. Many of the movement options which made UT2K4 a hit with the competitive scence as well as 'adrenaline' combos (admittedly a controversial addition in the first place) are no longer.However perhaps the most glaring design failure was the direction Epic decided to steer this game. Hot on the heels of Gears of Wars' success and with plenty of unused art assets, Epic tossed out the Tournament canon in favor of an extremely lackluster filler campaign akin to those that ship with the yearly COD releases. Furthermore, many prominent and loved tourney combatants were either removed or attached to an unrecognizable body. Graphically these bodies have been disfigured and hyper-muscularized and the lush arenas of previous titles have been tossed out in favor of the muddy, bloom and postprocessing-heavy urban jungles so characteristic of its generation. It's also worth noting that unlike its namesake, this game came out on console first and shipped to PC with a (since partially fixed) console UI. This disrespect for canon and shoddy presentation make clear one thing: on release, Epic simply valued money over their fan base.Sure, Epic didn't completely abandon the title, to their credit releasing several solid maps, patches and the Titan bonus pack, as well as sponsoring tournaments and the Make Something Unreal contest, but it was still only a band-aid over the aforementioned lacerating flaws of this title. Note that this support (long-since ended) came and went 3-years-ago, the community having dwindled to, at the time of this writing, one-to-three scantly populated servers per game mode (compared to 10-20 near-capacity in UT99/UT2K4).Did Epic release a few interesting new features for this game? Sure, the hoverboard/grapple is invaluable over larger maps and Warfare's bonus nodes bring variety to the mode; several of the new maps are also well-designed. However, it's a big loss compared to what you are giving up from the previous titles and I'd recommend that if you're into the larger-scale or competitive aspects look into UT2K4, quake-like team-arena modes UT99. Viewed apart from the series, it's a mediocre team-arena shooter with a weak community, and even Tribes: Ascend will serve you better.ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: If you do own a retail PC copy of UT3, you can save yourself the expense and redeem the key for a free Steam copy.

												This game has less customization than 2004. You can't really get into the game, feeling like you are the one playing. You can't really customise your team to the degree you could in 2004 unreal tournament. You can't choose your own hero, and you don't have many characters to choose from and all of them look stupid and on steroids, except for bishop who is white and bald. This was a really stupid mistake by Unreal franchise. You also don't have more skins to choose from with weapons and the multiplayer is not as full and hasn't got accurate numbers of players that are in the lobby (+7 - turns out there are none or 2 and it turns out again none). In addition they don't have assault and there is no choice for adranaline. Compared to 2004 this was a failure and a waste of money. The focus is on graphics and not really quality. If you liked 2004 UT don't buy this game. It's a stupid mistake by Unreal, they actually didn't listen to players what they liked about 2004.			"

												Has anybody ever heard of the Mandel effect?Remember when comedian Howie Mandel died in the late 80's? So do most people.Despite this, many are surprised to find that he is alive and well today, and hosts the hit TV show ""Deal or No Deal""The leading theory is that some people have shifted realities to one where Mandel never died, or else that some powerful entity is capable of manipulating our collective memories.

												What have I done?I didn't realize the version I -err- found online was stripped of all nonsense, Oh Dear, Oh My. Savegames don't save unless you make a new account, campaign progress randomly resets, it doesn't remember ANY SETTINGS, AT ALL, not keys, not resolution, video settings, anything. And the crappiest thing is, the INI files are written TODAY so it DOES write them, it KNOWS where the settings are, it just chooses to not save anything. This isn't a misunderstanding, lost permissions or a read only checkbox.What are you doing on Steam, asses? That's why I carry an entire platform on my back, so I don't have to make new accounts on every game, so I don't have to be online to play, and so I can have my progress saved.What were you thinking, not saving my campaign? What were you thinking, not saving key bindings? And what on Earth were you thinking when you decided to scr.w me over for not giving you my game to hold hostage? Since when do you dictate when i can load up a save or not? Asses.This is what happens when you don't get refunds. Screwed over.Here's another lovely thing: not only torrented version saves campaign, it's how it saves it that's funny. There are workarounds online in which if you mark the file read only while playing and then exit, it does save. So it's not an unavailable feature, it's a brave and screen centered FU.November 2007, Epic releases UT3. Little ""bug"", it doesn't save settings for offline users. ANY setting, including key bindings, graphics, saved weapon orders, etc.11-14-2007 - EpicForums[...] when i play off line my player name is just 'player' and none of my keyboard settings or graphic setup is remembered, even if i adjust the .ini. settings. win xp pro, and i do have admin rights.08-29-2008 - EpicForumsHowever, the game settings and campaign progress still aren't being saved. 04-05-2009 - EpicForumsHave you noticed that UT3 patch version 2.0 doesn't save settings for profile offline?08-10-2010 (meimeiriver) - SteamForumsHow do I get my Unreal Tournament 3 install to remember my settings?03-22-2011 - (Plumb_Drumb) BeyondUnrealForumsOkay, I went to play my Steam copy of UT3 toaday and noticed EVERYTHING has been reset to default.This is not a bug. This is a middle finger to every user who has bought your game and wishes to play offline. You can take this game and shove it.Originally posted by Beckizzle, epic forums, 2007:(quote) It might work after you submit your email, etc. Didn't ask me again after I did that.(/quote)No.Thats dumb.Good boy, beckizzle.

												The unreal tournament series is full of pedigree, when I first playing the original UT I was ecstatic with the awesome fast paced twitch focused firefights, so of course when Epic released UT 2003 and 2004 subsequently I did not hesitate and they were both masterpieces.Sadly this is not the case for UT 3, while the game in itself is awesome (albeit not as good as past interations, nostalgia much?), it suffers from some annoying bugs, one of which has made this game unplayable for me from the first 5 minutes of being owner and it hasn't let up, forcing me to peruse forums and whatnot to find a fix (hence the laughable amount of invested time in game, although I played it extensively with a friend before I bough my own copy).This annoying bug, for what I've found out, has been around since the game was released with no viable solution in sight, at first people blamed it on gamespy (RIP) and even though GS is long gone it still plagues the multiplayer throwing off the game servers with the message ""a duplicate login has been detected"".tl;dr: Good game but bad support renders it unplayable as intended (online)			"

												Probably the worst installment in the Unreal Tournament franchise (at least for single player). The campaign is supremely disappointing considering how terribly made the AI is. Opponent team AI seems to have been made more adept than the player's team AI. I realize how ridiculous sounds but you'll realize what I'm talking about when you have to single-handedly capture the flag, capture points, do objectives, etc. while they're busy running into a corner (like a lagger) or standing out in the open getting shot to smithereens.

												A once great game left damaged by the depature of Gamespy. The multiplayer feature is a shadow of its former self with broken mechanics and dodgey menus. It is a struggle to host and play with just friends. You have to mess around with ports and ip's and stuff which would be fine for anyone with knowledge of these things. However me and my friends don't so were left unable to play with one another. Needless to say we walked away from the game after trying for a bit and thoroughly would not recommend this game to anyone hoping to play privately with friends (this includes co-op campaign, 1v1's etc) unless you have the relevant know-how.

												Bad. Game is made via several shades of brown. New maps are bad, they took out the best game modes, changes to the old weapons are awful. This has contributed nothing at all to the series. The community is very dead these days, even Unreal 1999 has more players than this does. The new vehicles are pretty stupid and over powered. The combat doesn't feel smooth anymore and the modding community is pretty low and abandoned. They removed 80% of the player models from UT04. The new map editor is horrible and barely usable. If you really want to try this game, think twice. If you want to try the Unreal series, get the original one. 2k4 was okay as well. The only thing they possibly changed in a positive way was the campaign, they tried adding a story which was still a flop and not as good as 2k4. 5.7/10			"

												If you're a big fan of UT Classic and 2003/2004, then my suggestion is to not get this game. After finally playing through it's campaign, I can finally say that. It's just not good. At all.The storyline was bland, the characters stiff and fake, and a lot of old UT charm is just gone. If before it was about a TOURNAMENT, then this time that word isn't even said once. It's just Gears of Warish type of plotline, that's very, very boring. And the missions are incredibly repetitive.Gameplay is just not the same as in previous UT games. In UT3, shooting and moving feels a lot more....Quake 3 like than UT/2004 like.But yeah, just.....don't. Don't get this game, it's pretty bad, k?			"

Half of the UT3 single-player campaign levels seem to feature vehicles.  It is not uncommon for 3 teammate bots to run straight for one of the vehicles, get it stuck in your base, and then sit there inactive for the rest of the game.Otherwise, the graphics are nice and everything else is reminicent of UT2004.

												Bought this game because it was for sale, very glad it was only 4 bucks, otherwise I would've returned it immediately after the first level. The controls suck and aren't very customizable like in UT2004. Ex. Can't use tab key to hotkey a weapon, in my case I used the tab key to quickly switch to the flak cannon, now I cannot even bind anything to it. Ex2. Using the translocator has become cumbersome whereas in the past it was easy to quickly switch back and forth between weapons by pressing the right and left mouse button in quick sucession, that was removed in this case. Also there is no more translocator camera where you could hit Q a second time to view exactly where the translocator was landing, which would give more of a flow. Ex3. Double jumping and wall dodges seem useless now, you don't cover a large distance as fast as you could in UT2004. I played UT2004 religiously in the past and got really really good at it to a point where I'd be accused of aimbotting and banned from multiple servers. This game was created for the casual FPS gamer whose used to slower arena fights like Halo and COD (I like those games but seriously just watch a Quakecon tournament and you'll see what ""real"" FPS shooters are)4/10 graphics are nice but the music and map selection also suck			"

												Okay here's an honest review:I gotta give this one a big ""NO"". Not because I think it's a bad game. It looks good. And I'm sure the UT purists out there hate it for it's lousy Console-to-PC port. I can't say I blame them. But it's definitely not an unplayable game, as far as multiplayer mode goes. The big problem with UT3 is there are no players playing it. So what you're left with is a morsel of servers, with a few players here or there. But no real community behind it. It's a sad thing to see.Aside from that mess, the singleplayer experience is dreadful. A very boring campaign mode. It's lack luster at best, I always felt the single player modes in the UT series were unnecessary to begin with. I always skip right over them to play the multiplayer game.Anyways, it's quite unforunate to see what happened to this series. Here's hoping Epic fixes things for UT4. I just can't reccommend this game to anyone.			"

												Pretty meh compared to the earlier games. I suggest getting the original or UT2004 instead.The environments are all bland and gray/brown now. Your character feels a lot heavier. Onslaught has been replaced with Warfare. It's generally the same, but it has this strange system where you can instacap a node using a special power orb. It completely ruins the mechanics of whittling down a node until it falls, and then rebuild it for your own team. It's all about rushing the orb ASAP. Campaign is not as good as the typical tournaments were. The new lore about respawners and them being powered by flags (CTF) is just stupid.Overall, it's kinda fun, but also kinda dead. Get UT2004 instead, you will not regret it.			"

												Nearly piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Single player campaign sucks. Above all, multiplayer is dead. Buy first Unreal Tournament or UT 2004.And UT99's single player campaign not that bad. That's simple, ok, but its story is more reasonable than UT3's story: ""...Crush your enemies to win the tournament!"" And UT99's multiplayer is still alive.			"

												A major letdown after the previous ""Tournament"" games because of removed multiplayer modes and a ""storyline""-based single player campaign. Feels like a consolified, dumbed down tech demo for the Unreal 3 engine. Not worth playing when UT2k3 & 2k4 are both superior, cheaper, and still have players.			"

												I bought this game to play on a lan and it keeps on saying i'm not authorised to play. It's the only reason i bought this game and now it does not work. Apparently this is an issue going on from the release of UT3. It's shamefull that they still haven't found a solution even though the game is released in 2007. I wasted my money on this one. When the LAN game works it's a pain in the... You'll get so frustrated restarting steam/ UT3 that it's not worth playing with friends.Thank you Steam...			"

												DO NOT BUY!!!This game is now feature less and does not and will not keep any stats. (this issue could be resolved but EPIC clearly doesnt support this game) + there are no badges to be crafted here while there are steam badges for UT 2004.Graphics are great but for the most part distant objects are blured.There is no story here.Competitvness: - Noone is playing this game anymore so no online multiplayer with real opponents, - Weapons and the overall killing schema is mostly based on luck for an average UT3 player, - If you somehow do manage to find populated server youll be wrecked and by wrecked i mean GET DA fffffff-c-k OUTA HERE NO KILLS FOR YOU!Conclusion:If you wanna play this download it from t-o-r-e-n-t-z youll get the exact same game. FOR FREE!This game is not worth the purchase after GameSpy services went down.Side note for me:EPIC can provide Kick♥♥♥♥♥engine but crapy unsuported games.

												As fun as this game is, I just cannot see a reason to recommend this in a world where UT2004 exists.The previous iteration in the Unreal Tournament franchise has a better selection of modes, with assault, bombing run, and double domination all included, while the only truly new one to UT3 is vehicle CTF. UT3 also has betrayal and greed, but both are just variations on deathmatch for the most part.The weapon selection is fine, I personally miss the ripper and lightning gun, but its not that big of a deal. The updated graphics are quite nice, as well as the new vehicles and an actual story of some sort, but the lack of Assault mode is killer, and Bombing Run was a very fun introduction in UT2004 that sadly didn't make it here.Do yourself a favor and buy UT2004, it's a truly great game. This game isn't bad by any means, but it is lacking a lot of what it's predecessor brought to the table without much in the way of innovation to replace it.			"

												The Black Edition of Unreal Tournament 3 adds much needed new maps and gamemodes to add more content and is the definitive version of Unreal Tournament 3. UT3 is often forgotten and when it's not, people criticize it as being the worst Unreal Tournament game. Well, they're right. The games campaign is absolutely atrocious. Instead of the idea of the tournaments like in the other games and the managing that made UT2K4's single-player tournament ladder so fun, we instead have an actual story in which there's a war between the Necris and humans or something like that. It's absolutely forgettable and the way it tries to tie itself into the idea of respawning and doing things like Capture the Flag in a fully fledged war is just hilarious. It also features surprisingly atrocious acting (not exaggerating) and some of the worst writing I've seen in a game. The Unreal Tournament games had cheesy dialogue on purpose but when this takes itself so seriously it's just really hard to watch. The main issue with the game however is how heavy and weighty the movement is in this game. UT'99 and UT2K4 had fluid movement, which was needed for a fast paced arena game, but this along with muddy, bland graphics just makes it a game to skip and absolutely unnecessary when there are two far superior games and an incredible single-player focussed game, the original Unreal.Pros:+Music features some nice reinditions of UT99 classics+Sound effects are meaty, very well done+Fantastic particle effects+Vast amount of graphical setting options+Weapon array is nice as usual+Character customization is neat+Good atmosphere+New vehicles are awesome+Vehicles handle well+Onslaught is much improved from UT2K4'sCons:-Voice-acting goes beyond cheesy-Campaign should be skipped-Though music is good, there's a lack of new stuff-Graphics are bland and ugly despite having decent textures-Heavy feeling movement is a big negative in a game like this-Controller support leaves more to be desired-Less maps and gamemodes than the UT'99 and UT2K4-Characters all look big bulky and generic and aren't faithful to original designs-AI still hasn't been all that improved-Less mutators-No tournament style campaign like UT2K4-No people playing...never wereSound: 8/10Graphics: 4.5/10 Gameplay: 7/10Content/Replayability: 7/10Overall: 5.5/10I recommend UT3 if you're going to play as on easier difficulties to just mince some people, but there's no use spending time to relearn mechanics to play on harder difficulties if you played the others. Just skip it. Worse in most ways to its predecessors.			"

												Of all of the UT games made after 99, this might be the least bad.The gameplay is sub par, but it is a lot easier to get 10 people to download UT 3 off steam than it is to hand out UT99 CDs.  Actually that's not true; we had a bunch of authentication problems playing UT 3 on a LAN even though we all purchased it.The game DOES have a sniper rifle, and does NOT have that stupid♥♥♥♥♥lightning gun, so that's a huge plus.The rocket launcher's alternate fire only fires 3 rockets.  The only weapon with a lamer alt fire is the bio rifle.There are some classic maps which cool improvements, like Deck 17 and Facing Worlds.The single player campain is incredibly annoying.  Plotwise, they try to sort of invent this unecessary, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ story backwards from deathmatch to explain people dying and respawning all the time.  It seems complately unrelated to the ""plot"" of UT99.  The worst, though, is that you can't choose to play only deathmatch levels and/or completely ignore certain game modes.For multiplayer, they also try to force you onto some lame social media thing (which does not connect to steam) in order to play with other people.  I wish I had known that before buying.  At the last lan party I attended, no one was able to connect this way, so we all opted to play in disconnected/offline mode or whatever they call it.  Unfortunately when you do that, there is no UI for changing your name; you have to open the console and type something every single time you join.  Also, so far, I haven't found a way to save your single player progress in offline mode.A lot of very simple configurations and settings that I took for granted have been removed.  For example:  you can't do random map rotations.  UT 99 had a simple checkbox that let you enable map rotation to avoid playing the same order every time, or disable for people who hate fun.  It does seem like they've opted to have ""mutators"" take the place of simple configuration options, and I don't have a strong opinion on that, but they didn't include a mutator to put the random map feature back.The bot skill levels are a little wacky.  ""Skilled"" level bots spend a lot of time standing in one place waiting to be shot.  That seems like something that maybe only the first bot level should do.There is some new war mode thing with spheres.  Its kind of cool, although the vehicles are pretty lame.  Especially the hover board.  And Assault is gone.			"

												I can't believe that this game still exists. I like to believe that UT3 never happened and I regret ever buying this game, and I'm saying that as someone who used to be a huge fan of the Unreal Tournament games. This game is, in my opinion, THE reason why Unreal is a technology engine that's used for creating games and not a game itself. They make good technology but fail miserably at making actual games with that technology.Seriously, UT3 went backwards. It is missing game modes that were present in previous Unreal games. The game modes that do exist are uninspired at best. It's a lame beast.			"

												It's pretty much the same as UT2004, but with improved graphics, more vehicles and a few new modes. Since I liked the previous ones, I sure like this one too.Unfortunately, the number of players in the multiplayer will probably decrease rapidly in a short time due to the more popular shooters like Battlefield and CoD.Still, you can have some fun using instant action with bots or going through the campaign solo.

												Remember the golden days of UT99? Of course you do. This♥♥♥♥♥♥is epic yo (totally not flogging the studio...) UT3 is the continuation of what 2k3 and 2k4 tried to do, just a little better and with a far superior graphics engine. Heck, you can even try this on previously unthought machine hardware and you might get lucky. UT3 is by far the best out of the series and yet, that's also the most harshes downside.UT2k4 was the most community driven and creative scene game you can think of. Look at TF2 now, now look at UT2k4, they did it first. Just wasn't official sponcored. Oh wait, yes it was. Just that this one didn't get the same treatment, which is a shame, because this game deserves just as much attention as its predecessors. Still, worth a go, you won't regret it, I mean, ""Headshot"" never sounded so statisfying as it does coming from whence it came...3.7 / 5			"

												Another underrated avant-garde game from the Unreal saga, but something that has been admitted by the Epic Games Inc. as 'neglected'. The graphics are comparable to what we suppose would be the graphics of 2020, with additional applicable 3D options to enhance the experience. The issue that this game states is that 'feel' that unearthed when roaming UT2004; those options of being able to control the arena are lost, and the ability of the player degraded (I've certainly found that the 'Experienced' level on this is in some way harder than the 'Skilled' options of its direct predecessor (equivalent level 3 and 4 respectively). Notwithstanding, it is a credit to the Unreal series, and deserves to be pursued in future. It has set the precedent.			"

												Unreal Tournament 3 really is an incredible game, after playing the very earliest of the series for the majority of my childhood, 'Unreal Gold', then slowly, marching through the sequels, it seems that this is sits amongst the top of the series.  The gameplay is great, but as a game designed to be played multiplayer, as you progress through the campaign, it can get exceptionally difficult to complete, as your bots become more and more useless. But the general gameplay, graphics, sound, is great.If you've never played any of the games from the series, imagine halo with more guns, more vehicles, and insane fun!			"

												All those positive recommends be like ""good game, no players, but buy it!"" Come on, really? What kind of logic is that?I can understand only nostalgic value of purchase of this game, because honestly, this game sucks on many points of view and I would bore you to death if I try to list and explain them all. The main critics points would be slower pace than its' predecessors', less game modes and ultimately bad visual design with overbloomed flavour. Yes, it is fun to play ONS/WAR mode, mainly due to necris vehicles, but you need actual players to play it, and if hardly anyone plays it, then what's the point of purchase? A singleplayer campaign, which is exactly a squence of bot matches with uneven odds? Dozens of empty servers with minimal bot count set to 4-6? Frustratingly dumb but accurate bots? All this dancing around game account, logins and CD keys? Don't lie to yourselves, this isn't the game you would actively play. Get it only for collection and nostalgia, but don't hope for a really great match.			"

												The super-rifle servers in Unreal Tournament have always been a sort of Valhalla for veteran FPS players. You typically spawn surrounded by every weapon available in the map, and it rarely takes longer than 2 seconds to find yourself in combat. The gravity is low, the speed is high, and the maps are enormous. One would expect things to degenerate into a lacksidasical camp-fest, but victory and a huge pile of enemy heads usually fall to those who fight like true warriors: the lightnight-fast, strafe-jumping, run-and-gunners. The only problem with this game is that there are not enough people playing it, and this is truly a sad thing, since the next best thing, Quake 3, pales in comparison to the frenetic insanity that is the standard in UT super-rifle servers.

												Truly, one of my top and most beloved shooter of all time. Unreal Tournament. <33333333! Unreal Tournament 3 is a fun time, I don't care what ANYONE says. This game's got style, amazing music, crazy insane futuristic settings...its truly a masterpiece in my eyes and ears. So much damn fun. UGH! Come on people. You ever find yourself quoting ""Headshot! Double Kill! GODLIKE!"" Yeah...you can thank Unreal Tournament for that ^_^			"

												One of the greatest game series ever made.  I LOVE the art style in Unreal Tournament 3 and the more offensive approach that the vehicles have compared to Unreal Tournament 2004.  The action is still solid, fun, and brutal.Most of all, I love being so mobile and having such variety in weapons.  The semi-realistic shooter trend is not as enjoyable to me.  It feels so wrong to be forcibly slowed down and to have games that feel they must plagiarize the real world.  Imagination and pure fun are something I always revisit.I have many hours in the whole Unreal Tournament series not recorded on Steam.  Console AND PC versions.I recommend the HELL out of this game!			"

												I've been a fan of the Unreal series since the original Unreal, but i find UT3 to be the most disappointing of them all (yes, i liked Unreal 2 more).I hate how consolized the menu is, i hate how Epic tried to pander to the Gears of War fans with those bulky and incredibly ugly player models that all look the same, i hate how all the maps have been ""modernized"" by removing colors and making everything grey & bloom, and i hate how they scrapped the single player tournament, a feature which i personally loved especially after how awesome and interactive they made it in UT2004, and replaced it with a generic war story i could have found in any other action game.However, UT3 has a redeeming factor: the modding. Just like in the previous games, you can download new and interesting player models made by the community, or even some older ones from the previous games. As always you can download hundreds of interesting maps ranging from the silly ones and giant rooms to classic remakes to the more impressive well-done maps. Mutators and total conversions are also still available, my favourite one being The Crucible, although many good ones from the past like ChaosUT and Ballistic unfortunately didn't go beyond demo stages.To top it all off, you can replace the whole menu with one worthy of a PC game by using the MapMixer mod. I especially like how it also lets you ""clone"" bots to customize and rename them, a feature which hasn't been around since UT99. If you're like me and still hold a grudge on the art style direction they took with UT3, the ability to block off GoW bots and default maps from ever being played is also quite nice.I can't say anything about the online aspect because i haven't been able to find any servers, possibly due to my game's settings not wanting to work.All in all i still recommend this game to UT fans, but only if you're planning to download custom content for it. And if you're not a UT fan, i suggest checking out UT99 and UT2004 first.			"

												Unreal Tournament is back. In black. Ever since the first Unreal Tournament, there's been a lot of ""new versions"" released, and while they were funny and full of awesome weapons, enviroments and good old fashion rampage, they never quite lived up to the awesomeness that the first one brought. This one however, does the impossible. It takes all the amazing fun and carnage of the first, adds some neat graphics, a short but meaningful story for singleplayer, some more bad♥♥♥♥♥weapons, couple of vehicles, few new game modes, and even manages to take it to the next level! The time you can spend blasting friends, foes, bots, and everything else to pieces, it surprised even me!			"

The gameplay is still fun and excellent. however they removed some gamemodes which is minor. the weapons are great they have great sound design, they even brought back the enforcers and the impact hammer. now the style i rather like now granted its very gears of war-ish but its still nice. the campaign is meh its not worth playing honestly. now the community is very good, and the mods are awesome. my personal favorites are ballistic weapons, the crucible, and real guns.9.5/10 awesome game highly recommended but UT2004 is better "

This game controls awesome, feels great, looks good, and has some nice weapons for an FPS combat game.  HOWEVER it lacked flare and personality.  To be brutally honest, it felt like Painkiller Mutiplayer... but better graphics, guns, and controls.  Kind of lost its charm from the original and the mods out there are rather boring and small.

												I cant believe i havent recommended this one yet. Also it probably doesnt need one, its the church of PC FPS'ing. Anyone with a pc should really own a copy of one of the Unreal Tournements or the ... umm pc gamer fps police with come take ure pc away i guess. This is the latest instalment of the Unreal series and im starting to suspect it may be the last. Nexuiz is a more recent attempt to better this game but unfortunatly falls well short of the mark.  This style / genre of FPS's i believe are currently on a big downswing because of just how much people played this sort of thing back in the day. And now opt for more of the realist cover based / modern mockery shooters - not that theres anything wrong with that. But like the Unreal era i dont think it will last.Never the less its great, theres bugger all people playing multi, but the bots are still fun, its fast it flows and its generally fun in short bursts.

												Most people play this in multiplayer mode.The storyline is about revenge for an ambush at the beginning of the game. You travel from location to location hunting down the one who took your squad down. In the end, you end up on her home world and are in a fight for your life. I had only wished they would have made an expansion for that cliffhanger ending.Story mode out of the way, you have the same Unreal game with major updates to just about everything.1. The graphics look outstanding. Even at fast speeds.2. The music is low key so it does not get in the way.3. Hover boards to fast travel. Not to mention other vehicles.4. Revised weapons. (however the ripper is not in this game)5. Levels are unique and look quite impressive.6. Online rooms & players are still plentifulIf you love NON-Realistic FPS games. Pick this one up. If you cannot handle teleporters, antigravity, etc go back to BF & COD. This game playes fast and furious, with campers getting killed real quicklike.			"

												this is probably one of the best and deepest shooters on the market.  often overlooked because anyone can step in and use the standard controls never realizing there is depth buried in the system.not as twitch reflex as one would think, with a little map knowledge, skill, and utilizing all the options the great controls afford you, you can easily dominate the opposition in this game			"

												Unreal has a varied and rich history dating back to early gaming on home computers, like the x486. This particular iteration has fantastic graphics, and fun gameplay in a deathmatch VS style setting. There's even a single player campaign in which you can guide your own course, and make your own decisions. Lots of fun weapons, some classics, a few new, and fun ways to combine primary and alternate fire. This game includes some new vehicles as well. I particuarly like the new tentacle style set, each with unique uses and functions you can maximize through strategic use. Like any deathamtch game, it's all about the maiming and killing, and full of gore, violence, and revenge for the 12 kills made on you by somone else.			"

												Bought this way back when it was released. Just started playing it again. It's too bad they tried to put a story on top of this game. It really kinda detracts from it.I've been a big fan of the Unreal series since the original UT way back in... 1997? And strictly speaking, this game should be titled UT4. But whatever. On with the review.Same gameplay you've come to expect from NotQuake. I've always felt that UT was a bit (not a lot) less twitchy than the Qake series. A bit more... gritty I guess. Quake for me was about the crazy maps, whereas UT has always been about the gameplay. This one doesn't add much to the gameplay, but it's a BIG facelift, and it doesn't add nothing. In place of the relocater, you sometimes get a hoverboard. And vehicles and turrets work much better than in previous titles.Controls are quite good, graphics are top shelf, weapons are interesting but easy to figure out. Gameplay modes are what have come to be standard. Again, the story is just stupid.If this was a movie, I'd be telling you it's so bad you have to see it. Unreal Tournament doesn't need a story, and actually suffers for having one. It's so stupid I don't even want to talk about it; I just want to ♥♥♥♥♥ about how mindless it is. Seriously, I will watch Go Fish: the Epic Miniseries before I sit through a cutscene or listen to a dialog in this game.			"

												Lots of fun, this pretty much a modern Quake III. It's what Nexuiz should have been, plus there's a campaign (although a bit bland). The strength is arena battles, which are very fast paced. The game features an array of gamemodes in both multiplayer and campaign, and they all have plentiful weapons that drop in a Quake-esque way. The framerates were high even at the highest settings (the menus had a lot of features to enable/disable), and that made it really easy to track and get kills without clientside lag.I found the way the campaign explained the respawn and weapon drops a little silly, it's generally better for it to remain a mystery unless your excuse is really good (looking at Assassin's Creed).If you liked Quake, get this game. If you were disappointed with Nexuiz, get this game. It's pretty cheap, and defiantly worth the money.			"

												Most people play this in multiplayer mode.The storyline is about revenge for an ambush at the beginning of the game. You travel from location to location hunting down the one who took your squad down. In the end, you end up on her home world and are in a fight for your life. I had only wished they would have made an expansion for that cliffhanger ending.Story mode out of the way, you have the same Unreal game with major updates to just about everything.1. The graphics look outstanding. Even at fast speeds.2. The music is low key so it does not get in the way.3. Hover boards to fast travel. Not to mention other vehicles.4. Revised weapons. (however the ripper is not in this game)5. Levels are unique and look quite impressive.6. Online rooms & players are still plentifulIf you love NON-Realistic FPS games. Pick this one up. If you cannot handle teleporters, antigravity, etc go back to BF & COD. This game playes fast and furious, with campers getting killed real quicklike.			"

												While not as feature packed as its prior incarnation (UT 2004), UT3 is however one of the best ""realistic looking"" FPS games still available for purchase on the market (with the added bonus that its system requirements are now only a fraction of what modern dull looking FPS games demand), however the only thing lacking from UT3 is rebindable keys for gamepads (the game despite the lack of Steam store description has native support for the XBOX360 controller) but this is for most people a minor/non issue.At the time the Unreal games were so groundbreaking that even current FPS games are nothing other then a copy & paste affair in their feature (double jumps, power armor mechs in an FPS etc..) list; in fact I remember that when the original Unreal was released the 'Internets' and the ancient stone age technology known as BBS were full of people offering advice/guides (or begging for such advice/guides) on how to optimize their PC for Unreal, unsurprisingly when the original Unreal was released just like when the original Doom and Quake was released there was an upsurge in people getting new computers and/or upgrading their computers.  We owe a lot to these games as they were at the time the principal driving force behind the rapid processing power/technological advancement of household computers, it was also the principal cause of many young adults going bankrupt in the 90s.

UT3 is the continuation of what 2k3 and 2k4 tried to do, just a little better and with a far superior graphics engine. Heck, you can even try this on previously unthought machine hardware and you might get lucky. UT3 is by far the best out of the series and yet, that's also the most harshes downside.UT2k4 was the most community driven and creative scene game you can think of. Look at TF2 now, now look at UT2k4, they did it first. Just wasn't official sponcored. Oh wait, yes it was. Just that this one didn't get the same treatment, which is a shame, because this game deserves just as much attention as its predecessors.

												The super-rifle servers in Unreal Tournament have always been a sort of Valhalla for veteran FPS players. You typically spawn surrounded by every weapon available in the map, and it rarely takes longer than 2 seconds to find yourself in combat. The gravity is low, the speed is high, and the maps are enormous. One would expect things to degenerate into a lacksidasical camp-fest, but victory and a huge pile of enemy heads usually fall to those who fight like true warriors: the lightnight-fast, strafe-jumping, run-and-gunners. The only problem with this game is that there are not enough people playing it, and this is truly a sad thing, since the next best thing, Quake 3, pales in comparison to the frenetic insanity that is the standard in UT super-rifle servers.

												I cant believe i havent recommended this one yet. Also it probably doesnt need one, its the church of PC FPS'ing. Anyone with a pc should really own a copy of one of the Unreal Tournements or the ... umm pc gamer fps police with come take ure pc away i guess. This is the latest instalment of the Unreal series and im starting to suspect it may be the last. Nexuiz is a more recent attempt to better this game but unfortunatly falls well short of the mark.  This style / genre of FPS's i believe are currently on a big downswing because of just how much people played this sort of thing back in the day. And now opt for more of the realist cover based / modern mockery shooters - not that theres anything wrong with that. But like the Unreal era i dont think it will last.Never the less its great, theres bugger all people playing multi, but the bots are still fun, its fast it flows and its generally fun in short bursts.

												Gorgeous game with great run and gun play. Has all the classic weapons you'd expect and they feel great, though the rocket launcher's different fire modes are needlessly complicated to switch. The flak cannon used to be my go-to UT weapon but the stinger mini-gun definitely takes the cake this time! There are some cool new gameplay modes and tons of fun maps but I do miss  the old Assault and Domination modes. The vehicles are really cool too! The single player campaign is a bit of a let down, the gameplay is really fun, but the story is hard to follow. A few characters seem cool but never get developed, the few cutscenes and mission briefing voiceovers do not effectively convey the story. It's a shame there weren't more teams/factions/clans introduced, and I was particularly bummed that the Skaarj didn't make an appearance. Character models sadly seemed more like Gears of War leftovers than of Unreal Tournament design. So while the sloppily thrown together single player campaign is a tad disappointing, the overall gameplay is still great fun and it looks great. More fun than UT2k3 and UT2k4!			"

												A game for only the most hardcore of players, you either are amazing or terrible at this game.  The insanely fast pace and powerful weapons will definately be a turnoff for people used to the slower pace of console shooters.  Sadly not many people playing this game lately which means a lot of fighting braindead bots or playing against of few inhumanly good players.			"

												Gorgeous game with great run and gun play. Has all the classic weapons you'd expect and they feel great, though the rocket launcher's different fire modes are needlessly complicated to switch. The flak cannon used to be my go-to UT weapon but the stinger mini-gun definitely takes the cake this time! There are some cool new gameplay modes and tons of fun maps but I do miss  the old Assault and Domination modes. The vehicles are really cool too! The single player campaign is a bit of a let down, the gameplay is really fun, but the story is hard to follow. A few characters seem cool but never get developed, the few cutscenes and mission briefing voiceovers do not effectively convey the story. It's a shame there weren't more teams/factions/clans introduced, and I was particularly bummed that the Skaarj didn't make an appearance. Character models sadly seemed more like Gears of War leftovers than of Unreal Tournament design. So while the sloppily thrown together single player campaign is a tad disappointing, the overall gameplay is still great fun and it looks great. More fun than UT2k3 and UT2k4!			"

												I cant believe i havent recommended this one yet. Also it probably doesnt need one, its the church of PC FPS'ing. Anyone with a pc should really own a copy of one of the Unreal Tournements or the ... umm pc gamer fps police with come take ure pc away i guess. This is the latest instalment of the Unreal series and im starting to suspect it may be the last. Nexuiz is a more recent attempt to better this game but unfortunatly falls well short of the mark.  This style / genre of FPS's i believe are currently on a big downswing because of just how much people played this sort of thing back in the day. And now opt for more of the realist cover based / modern mockery shooters - not that theres anything wrong with that. But like the Unreal era i dont think it will last.Never the less its great, theres bugger all people playing multi, but the bots are still fun, its fast it flows and its generally fun in short bursts.

												Most people play this in multiplayer mode.The storyline is about revenge for an ambush at the beginning of the game. You travel from location to location hunting down the one who took your squad down. In the end, you end up on her home world and are in a fight for your life. I had only wished they would have made an expansion for that cliffhanger ending.Story mode out of the way, you have the same Unreal game with major updates to just about everything.1. The graphics look outstanding. Even at fast speeds.2. The music is low key so it does not get in the way.3. Hover boards to fast travel. Not to mention other vehicles.4. Revised weapons. (however the ripper is not in this game)5. Levels are unique and look quite impressive.6. Online rooms & players are still plentifulIf you love NON-Realistic FPS games. Pick this one up. If you cannot handle teleporters, antigravity, etc go back to BF & COD. This game playes fast and furious, with campers getting killed real quicklike.			"

Opening dozens of ports, disabling firewalls, running stunservers etc. Sometimes it works with one other player, sometimes with 2, and once you disconnect from a map it may stop working altogether, It's extremely random. Epic's refusal to address these widely reported issues is really quite shocking. Get this on sale only!			"

												Unreal Tournament has been a great series, including this game. The Action is fast paced and fluid with beautiful, yet smooth graphics. for a game made in 2007, it really puts other games to shame. There are plenty of Game Modes, Maps, and Settings that will keep its replay value high, even 7 years after its release. The ingame AI (Bots) play like a human so having good internet really isn't a huge requirement to fully enjoy this game. This game also comes with a Map Editor using the Unreal 3 Engine so you can make your ideas come to life. Like most other Unreal Games, this game has plenty of Mod Support.			"

												Unreal Tournament 3 really is an incredible game, after playing the very earliest of the series for the majority of my childhood, 'Unreal Gold', then slowly, marching through the sequels, it seems that this is sits amongst the top of the series.  The gameplay is great, but as a game designed to be played multiplayer, as you progress through the campaign, it can get exceptionally difficult to complete, as your bots become more and more useless. But the general gameplay, graphics, sound, is great.If you've never played any of the games from the series, imagine halo with more guns, more vehicles, and insane fun!			"

												While yes the campain is just a bunch lame excuses to make you play the stock maps and therefor rather.. lame. Thats not why you play this game. You play unreal for the epicly fast paced multiplayer. CoD and halo palyers wish they could play a shooter this fast paced! Also the mod support isnt that bad wich is good beacuse of all the awesome maps and mutators out there.also this is where MONSTER KILL!!! comes from so thats a plus :D			"

												Another underrated avant-garde game from the Unreal saga, but something that has been admitted by the Epic Games Inc. as 'neglected'. The graphics are comparable to what we suppose would be the graphics of 2020, with additional applicable 3D options to enhance the experience. The issue that this game states is that 'feel' that unearthed when roaming UT2004; those options of being able to control the arena are lost, and the ability of the player degraded (I've certainly found that the 'Experienced' level on this is in some way harder than the 'Skilled' options of its direct predecessor (equivalent level 3 and 4 respectively). Notwithstanding, it is a credit to the Unreal series, and deserves to be pursued in future. It has set the precedent.			"

												Don't be fooled by the playtime, I actually own a hardcopy and have played it for weeks (maybe months playtime) over the last couple of yearsUT... oh the hours I've spent playing this in my youth. First blood, the greatest honor one could get. Everybody was out to kill and the pros hunted for ""first blood"". Capture the flag, team matches or just kill them all. Now, after all those years, it is just a great way to relax, 'cause hey, what is there to loose, run, shoot, kill, get kille, you'll respawn almost instantaneously anyway, so just have fun.Yes, the graphics are a little last decade, but that's only because that's where this game is from.Fortunately, the fun is also a little last decade i.e. uncensored mayhem with ultra-cool weapons, you'll probably get mixed up but still have fun shooting your way through the other team.

												The pros:It has all the great basics of Unreal: nice graphics, the classic Unreal series weaponry, and intense combat.The neutral:The general visual appearance is darker and gloomier than in the previous titles. I liked it, from the aesthetic point of view. In online matches, it might make it harder to spot your opponents, which I believe is the reason why some people complained about it.The cons:Even though single player has not been the main target in any of the Tournament series games, this does it worse than the previous titles. Forcibly introducing ""respawners"" and ""FLaGs"" into the original UT story was just lame. I'd rather have confronted Xan once more. Also, most characters look like they had been overdosing on steroids.Recommended? Yes and no. For hardcore fans of the Unreal series or the genre, why not. But if you're looking for a state-of-the-art online arena shooter, it's probably a better idea to get UT 4 right now. Even though it's still ""pre-alpha"", it probably has more online players than this, and it will do most things even better when it's complete.			"

I enjoy this game very much playing just with bots, which are relentless..Recommended buy for every UT fan. Also, you should try the UT4 which is under development, that one is even closer to UT99.

												Cool gfx but what happened to the RL and Flak Cannon?  The flak is useless at more than one meter and the RL is nerfed in that you need 2 direct hits before your enemy dies.  Where's the splash damage gone at??UT99 is still way better, smoother and faster.I'd still recommend it though, like the weirdo makes-no-sense guy that I am.			"

												Well its the most recent of the UT series so is it as great as 2004 well let's find out. Now graphics are still awesome even in 2012. The gameplay is still fun and excellent. however they removed some gamemodes which is minor. the weapons are great they have great sound design, they even brought back the enforcers and the impact hammer. now the style i rather like now granted its very gears of war-ish but its still nice. the campaign is meh its not worth playing honestly. now the community is very good, and the mods are awesome. my personal favorites are ballistic weapons, the crucible, and real guns.9.5/10 awesome game highly recommended but UT2004 is better "

												Disregard playtime, I have about over 500 hours outside steam.No matter what are people telling you, this is not a bad UT game! It was bad at launch, yes, but the game changed a lot since then. It's definitively better than it's predecessor.It has the best weapon balance yet (hell, even the Bio rifle is useful for once). People are just mad because the characters look straight outa Gears of War.Regarding play-style it's much like the original UT99 - faster than UT2k4, not as floaty as UT2k4 and not all hitscan.That being said, a new Unreal Tournament game is coming soon for free, so there's not much point in buying this  outside of the Unreal Deal Pack anymore (or any UT games for that matter).EDIT: You might want to play this instead of the new UT afterall... at least for now x)			"

												Unreal has a varied and rich history dating back to early gaming on home computers, like the x486. This particular iteration has fantastic graphics, and fun gameplay in a deathmatch VS style setting. There's even a single player campaign in which you can guide your own course, and make your own decisions. Lots of fun weapons, some classics, a few new, and fun ways to combine primary and alternate fire. This game includes some new vehicles as well. I particuarly like the new tentacle style set, each with unique uses and functions you can maximize through strategic use. Like any deathamtch game, it's all about the maiming and killing, and full of gore, violence, and revenge for the 12 kills made on you by somone else.			"

												Bought this way back when it was released. Just started playing it again. It's too bad they tried to put a story on top of this game. It really kinda detracts from it.I've been a big fan of the Unreal series since the original UT way back in... 1997? And strictly speaking, this game should be titled UT4. But whatever. On with the review.Same gameplay you've come to expect from NotQuake. I've always felt that UT was a bit (not a lot) less twitchy than the Qake series. A bit more... gritty I guess. Quake for me was about the crazy maps, whereas UT has always been about the gameplay. This one doesn't add much to the gameplay, but it's a BIG facelift, and it doesn't add nothing. In place of the relocater, you sometimes get a hoverboard. And vehicles and turrets work much better than in previous titles.Controls are quite good, graphics are top shelf, weapons are interesting but easy to figure out. Gameplay modes are what have come to be standard. Again, the story is just stupid.If this was a movie, I'd be telling you it's so bad you have to see it. Unreal Tournament doesn't need a story, and actually suffers for having one. It's so stupid I don't even want to talk about it; I just want to ♥♥♥♥♥ about how mindless it is. Seriously, I will watch Go Fish: the Epic Miniseries before I sit through a cutscene or listen to a dialog in this game.			"

I'm able to overlook it because multiplayer is fun and thankfully always works--it's got that classic old school shooter appeal without the lame leveling you see in newer games today that give players an unfair advantage because they have played more hours and are given better perks than you. It still has a decent community of players making it easy finding a game.			"

Chewing on their welfare wheat from Carthage.But this game is dead meat by comparison. Frankly... it fails. "

												Wow... What a game this is! I sorely misunderstood it's strengths and underestimated this game for years. I've always tried to play through the single player campaign and always bounced right off it as that mode is genuinely terrible, repetitive and boring. However as I'll go onto explain, this was a mistake.Firstly, the reason for not enjoying the campaign mode is due to it focusing on the ""Capture the Flag"" and ""Warfare"" team modes. Capture the Flag (CTF) is a familair game type and Warfare is about Capturing Control Points which includes vehicles you can use to fight your battles along with the usual weapons. Warfare matches in particular are normally set on huge sprawling battle fields for it to take place across... so why is this terrible?It boils down to the Bot AI specifically for Warfare (CTF isn't too bad to be fair)... simple as that. They cannot play this team mode in any fun way and these long.. drawn out...  tug of war matches get mired in stalemate and boredom. There are only so many times you can spend minutes trekking across a huge map to be killed pointlessly and then respawn to do it again. With human teams, working together to co-ordinate attack and defence, I imagine it would be great... but the bots know nothing of a high strategy and the game degenerates into pockets of combat that just chew up and spit everyone out resulting in a grind. No flanking, feints, different paths of attack or even retreating, just running at each other, fighting, dying and doing it again which is ultimately what the player is drawn into as well. Awful...  and so UT3 was in my view the worst game of the series... UNTIL! I ignored the campaign mode and just worked through every available map via the Instant Action option (i.e. Custom Match Mode), sticking to the game types I enjoyed. Playing like this is BRILLIANT...  I played Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Greed ( a form of deathmatch CTF) and Instagib deathmatch (one hit kills) all on Adept difficulty and just ignored the other modes I didn't like or just weren't enjoyable to play with bots... and man alive what a game!The speed, the sound, the graphics, the weapons..  adept diffculty was the exact amount of challenge for me at the time of writing. Every match was an unknown and I never went into a game confident I'd win or sure I'd lose. UT3 is on par with the mighty UT 1999 (IMHO) when it comes to playing with bots on the main Deathmatch modes. It is great!I ended up playing 145 matches across those 4 modes on every map to eventually win them all, and that doesn't include the games I played on the campaign in co-op with Steam friends, or the experiments with some of the other modes like Betrayal or CTF. Truely an excellent game when you stick to it's strengths and I enjoyed ""completing"" the game per my own rules for doing so. I think making my own objectives within some games is going to breathe new life into them where I have stopped playing due to a lack of direction from the game or a terrible single player story / campaign mode. It's not something I have done before... as silly as that sounds, and I am glad I did here as it opened my eyes to an excellent game.Although I have completed my ""Adept"" run, I'll be trying again on harder difficulties and downloading user maps for sure. This game will likely stay on my hard drive for a long time and the ""time played"" (currently 35hrs) will increase beyond what is recorded here, just like UT 1999.			"

												A  fast paced FPS based off of the quake games and a sequel to the other unreal games UT3 offers many gamemode, insane weapons, epic vehicles, and a character making menu where instead of selecting a character you can make one. The campaign is a actual storyline unlike the tournament style singleplayer from previous unreal tournaments and you can have friends play with you through the campaign. If you like fast paced shooters this is a great game			"

												The 2007 version of the Epic's renown first person shooter is on with the new Unreal Engine 3. You can expect no less than action, gore and an infamous campaign that can be played in a online co-op (or solo, as well). The visuals are sick, and can entertain the player in every map. If you're a fan of the Unreal series, that's your call - if you're not, maybe it's time to re-think your FPS skills. ;-)			"

												Though I can't say that this is the best of the Unreal series, it's an incredibly fun game to play, online, or by yourself.The good? It's quite beautiful indeed, definitely a show of what the Unreal engine is capable of. The weapons are for the most part fun to use, all with a secondary mode that makes the battle more interesting. The AI on your team are always a little duller than the rest, so you're forced to join the carnage on a more tactical level.The bad? The campaign is a pretty average, as you would expect. The usual ""you wronged us and now we're gonna go to great lengths to kill you even though it won't solve anything in the grand scheme of things"" storyline. The AI tend to get stuck on each other (or snipe you with Enforcers from the other side of the map if you're giving Godlike a go), and great Scott, if you just add a chainsaw machine gun and a working cover system and you've got Gears of War. Seriously, the armour style, the main antagonist is some crazy chick who wants nothing but pain as far as the eye can see. And not to mention your stereotypical upbeat wise-crackin' black guy.I'd recommend this game to anyone interesting in the new and old takes on arena-style first-person shooters.			"

												While the graphics aren't anything special now, you gotta remember that this was the first game that used the Unreal Engine 3, and at the time it dropped our jaws to the frikkin floor.The weapons and modes of the much beloved and excellent UT2004 return, along with a rudimentary campaign/ladder thing, yet the meat of the game lied in multiplayer. So, in short, this was everything that UT2004 was, but with much better graphics. Which is the puzzling thing: UT2004 was immensely popular. This one wasn't. It felt slightly clunkier. Slightly heavier. Slightly slower. Slightly less fun. Or maybe the world was fed up and/or saturated with online FPS games with otherworldly environments and weapons when it came out. Whatever the case, this was not very popular, and the years haven't been particularly kind to it and its playerbase online.That being said, for newcomers to the series, it's worth playing today, even if it is with bots, if only to familiarise yourself with the franchise till the new one is out properly.

												For the TlDR's..If your after some intense singleplayer jump right in fragfest with nice visuals get this game. the bots suit all levels of ability up to godlike players to casuals. dont expect much for multiplayer matches..  this games commonly on sale for £6 usually.. then its worth your money :) wouldnt recommend paying full price.I've played Unreal since UT99 GOTY And love the series. Pros-fast paced game play with favourite weapons from the old games-the graphics are amazing.. low end systems will easily get 100 fps on highest quality which is a massive bonus-bots are smart with massive variation in difficulty for new and veteran players-Lots of maps, game modes & mutators-single player campaign isnt too bad.-like the originals.. theres tons of community contentCons-warzone game mode is irritating and some what unplayable.. I didnt like warzone in earlier games so this isnt a big deal to me-multiplayer is dead.. if your looking for multiplayer UT, go for 99 2004 & the UT4 free alpha game on epics website-maps look visually pleasing but just lack pacing & gameplay quality to older games.
