												The best and only true Co-op mod for Half-Life 2's. It is little bit buggy, but aside of that having friend next to you bugs dosen't really matter. You are more likely to laugh to them than raging over them. I highly recommend this to people who are reaching together with friend for fun co-op experience that is of course Synergy.			"

												Well/\........I dont know where to begin......this game is the symbol of anarchy....if you have half life 2 GET THIS GAME.  Synergy is a game about just playing half life with your friends, but no, its not even that.  IT IS CHAOS IN A GAME.  First time I played this I was in a game with 16 players.  Mainly it was about getting to the end of the level as fast as possible doing whatever it takes.  Its not as easy as you think though, YOU WILL DIE MANY TIMES. Me and a few random players started rushing through the game, if we met a antlion guard, we would beat it down with crowbars then fire rockets at it.  We would cover the map in our own sprays while spamming mics and killing ourselves.  Running full-steam ahead into a pile of combine and all of us dueling out with crowbars.  Out of all of it my favorite map would be Highway 17 or Nova Prospect.  The only problem I have with this game is how Hectic it is, Even though its fun at times it can still be horrible trying to walk across a single plank without being pushed off, or lose your partner and attacked by a horde of Zombbombs. Also the crashing os horrible ;(.   Extras:Wanna good song to listen to while playing? Sonic X theme song                                                                             Also the community is derranged: One server at night I went in had 7 guys                                                                                         and 3 women talking about politics while attacking Combine.                                                                             Another one had a bunch of kids crying over getting killed XD                             10/10 STILL PLAYING AGAIN			"

												When 15 of the one and only Gordan Freeman run into a hallway and simultaneously get whacked unconcious by the same cop, you know it's gonna be a good game.  You start your journey by cooperatively breaking the mini teleporter in Kleiner's  lab faster than a 10 year old on xbox live can realize when his internet has just cut out.  Proceed to race your fellow chums to numerous respawning copies of the same laser mounted airboat before you have to wait in line with nothing but the sound your crowbar makes when it hits other players to entertain yourself.  Stomp all over that antlion awaking sand because you brought an army this time and no one gives a ♥♥♥♥ about whether or not that rebel loser's friend is gonna get killed due to your lack of self reserve.  Get vaporized at least 50 times in the combine elevators from violent swarms of electric balls launched by your cackling comrades.  Lastly, break the shock and awe that resides in the silence of the game's final, time stopping, life endangering, jaw dropping, moments with a subtle ""sometimes I dream about cheese"" sounded off by using your keen dialogue wheel.  99/10, A player took out a whole server with an explosive barrel and followed it up by singing the national anthem.

												Half Life 2 and GTA: San Andreas have a few things in common - they're both single player, they were both released in 2004, they're two of the best games ever made, but best of all: they both had communities which were technically capable of creating multiplayer experiences. GTA SA has Multi Theft Auto and HL2 has Synergy!As well as being able to experience the whole HL2 story with your friends you're able to play a variety of other co-operative maps and you can even make one yourself with Hammer. Like any modification though, Synergy is not perfect. Server stability was bad and there are some annoying bugs like not being able to pickup ammo. But these problems won't stop you from experiencing a co-operative HL2 campaign.			"

												I feel like people in this game who reviewed it, did it with obvious hollow bias. Most of the reviews say ""It's good, I can play with friends"" and such, but none of them go into detail of the games current state.For starters, the community is practically dead. You'll only find about 50+ servers, with a total of about 12 people, the most in one place you'll find is 2 or 3. Even Sven Coop, the game's predecessor, has far more people playing.The developer has Soon™ syndrome. Yes, I know he's working on Black Mesa Source and other games, I'm not bashing him. But I’ve seen it several times on the forums where he promises an update, only for it to never be announced. The last time he said anything publicly outside of the forums was May 28th, 2015. It's been over a year since content has been updated.Combine are insanely overpowered; Weapons have been nerfed. The SMG1 is the most notable. In HL2, you could take the SMG 1 most of the game and it would do. In Synergy, the SMG1 is a pea shooter that can barely kill metro police. The Combine have been mega buffed; they take forever to kill (Even with the new LMG). They'll gun you down in seconds and you'll even be lucky if you manage to harm one considerably.Most of the built in maps are outdated and near impossible to beat since there is no checkpoints. You die, that's it. No setting can change that. Since the maps aren't built around the Combine Weapons changes, you'll be lucky if you even get past any level with combine.The modding community is scarce, barely any mods and they're not very diverse. You can't add player models unless you're a donor, and the only way you can become a donor is if you donate, but you have to wait until the next update for perks. And with a developer suffering Soon™ Syndrome, the approximate time you'd get perks is between now and when Half Life 3 is released. Most of the mods were ripped or stolen directly from Gamebannana, and you could easily make your own just by renaming a few files and swapping things around and then just plopping it in the custom folder like it's nothing.I'm not trying to stomach punch the game or the developer. But people should know the truth instead of hearing the bias in these recent reviews. All I see is ""The game is gud I can ply with friendz"" or generic copy pasta. I hope this game gets revised and revived somehow, at some point. Because if the games predecessor, Sven-coop is doing better than its successor, then there's quite an issue, isn't there? If you really want a source engine coop game, I'd suggest Obsidian Conflict. Sven-coop if you're on a potato.			"

												Synergy is not a game, it is a brilliant way of satisfying a human's need for social interaction with friends. Now players can play one of the best Source games to date with friends, and it's completely free if you already own the HL2 base game, or multiple other source games. And it's not just regular old HL2. This is remastered, with weapons that were planned but never released for the final game, new mechanics, and plenty of hilarity where cheats are involved. Have you ever wanted to fly on top of cliffs and skip portions of the game? With the right server you can do that. Have you ever wanted to drive an 8-seated truck and have all your friends do drive-bys on CPs? With the right server, you can do that.My final rating for this mod is a 9.89/10 on the richter scale to the 8th power divided by the square root of 3.8. Yeah, it's that good.			"

												This mod is what many half life players have wanted for years. 9/10.The second half life online game is what I have wanted to do with my friends for a very long time, but it did not exist. So you can imagine how happy I was when my mates told me about this.The games brother (Sven) is extremely addictive; The same can be said about this.Synergy does have speed runners like Sven which is the main disadvantage. But this can be prevented by hosting a server with your friends.One last thing would be that almost every server has custom music that can be triggered by any player at any moment. This means it gets spammed over and over until you go mad and have to leave the server, which really gets on my nerves.This is a 9/10			"

												Wow, never knew how much fun I could have with random strangers playing a game that's meant to only be singleplayer. I spent about 12 hours playing through Half Life 2, then Episode 1, then Episode 2 (currently my time says 11, but Steam went down about 5 times during the whole thing) and it originally started out with me and a friend just playing around in the very beginning of the game. By the time we got to Route Kanal (or whatever the chapter is that you get the airboat) the server already had 10/10 players. Over time people came and go, but we still had fun. WHen we got to Episode 2, we had a group called ""The Originals"" which was the people who had been on since the first Half Life 2. I made about 6 friends that day, and one of them even bought then installed Episode 1 just so he could continue to play the game with us. THis is one of my favorite mods around and I hope to have more fun in time.Edit: I also ended up getting an hour of sleep before waking up and violently puking. Worth it.			"

												WOAH, I almost forgot to review this game. This is Synergy and it is also a Half-Life 2 MOD and no it does not come with the HL2 Content SO you need to buy Half-Life 2 first. Do I enjoy this game? Yes but I want to ask you something now. Was HL2 or any other HL2 Mod REALLY hard with 1 person? That my friend is why they made this a CO-OP version of HL2. It supports HL2, HL2 EP1 and HL2 EP2 IT EVEN WORKS WITH MINERVA: METASTASIS. Which all 4 of those are REALLY fast paced action and sci fi games. So why not give this game a try. It has a Steam Workshop and it is really fun I think you might actually enjoy this game. I give this game a rating of 9/10 It could use some work on the difficulty on the maps that are bundled with this game but I think that really that is the only problem with this game.			"

												If you love playing Half-Life and co-op as much as I do then this is the free piece of software to bond them together!  Half-Life 2 is great playing with friends.  Synergy enables Half-Life 2 to be played co-op.  Here is what I did to get it working.Enjoy!!Playing Half-Life 2 co-op using SynergyBoth game host and client:Download and install Half-Life 2:Download and install Synergy (free):Game host:1) Open port 27015 TCP and UDP on your router2) Get your REAL internet IP address (shown at the bottom left hand corner) and give this number to the client joining your game:http://www.speedtest.net/3) Start up Synergy4) Start server for Half-Life 2 from the Synergy menu optionsNote: Them trying to join your game via Steam friends or sending them game invites will NOT work. It will try connecting to the actual IP address of your PC (usually 192.168.x.x) which is local and not public. You will get host connect failures. Client:1) Start Synergy2) Enable Developer Console:The console starts disabled by default. To enable it, load the game and visit Options > Keyboard > Advanced. There will be a pop-up that will include two options, one of them labeled ""Enable Developer Console"". Once enabled, it can be opened and closed by pressing the button above Tab ⇆, known as the ""tilde."" ~3) Enter Developer Console with the ~ key and enter connect command to the host internet IP address:~ connect xx.xx.xx.xxYou then should be connected and able to play co-op!

												The best thing about this game is that you can play a good number of single-player Half-Life 2 mods in co-op. There’s 7 mods with built-in support (Calamity, City 7: Toronto Conflict. Dangerous World, MINERVA: Metastasis, Offshore, Riot Act, Rock 24) and a lot of unofficial mod supports you can get from the workshop (21 as of April 2017). Check out the complete list here: 


Mod Supports 

By: Balimbanana

			Mod Supports are collections of map edits and content loaders for being able to play Source Mods co-op. This list will be updated with any new mod supports.		


If you find the game too hard or too easy, you can adjust the difficulty by changing some server variables in skill_mod.cfg. For example, if you set sk_dmg_take_scale3 to 2.5 and sk_dmg_inflict_scale3 to 2, the enemies will be very dangerous, but at the same time not spongy.Turn off player respawns (mp_respawndelay 0) and you’ve got yourself a hardcore survival game somewhat similar to No More Room in Hell or Left 4 Dead on Expert.

												It's a lot of fun to replay the HL:2 series with friends as well as strangers. It's like playing it all over again in a new way. Nobody gets left behind because there is a required amount of people before it will progress to the next level, depending on the amount of people present in the game. My only gripe (a major one) is that there is hardly ever someone actually playing the game. I resort to having to play with Steam friends, which isn't a problem. But if they arn't online, good luck finding a game with more than 2 afk people. Great game/mod, highly recommended if you havn't played HL2 in a while!			"

												When 15 of the one and only Gordan Freeman run into a hallway and simultaneously get whacked unconcious by the same cop, you know it's gonna be a good game. You start your journey by cooperatively breaking the mini teleporter in Kleiner's lab faster than a 10 year old on xbox live can realize when his internet has just cut out. Proceed to race your fellow chums to numerous respawning copies of the same laser mounted airboat before you have to wait in line with nothing but the sound your crowbar makes when it hits other players to entertain yourself. Stomp all over that antlion awaking sand because you brought an army this time and no one gives a ♥♥♥♥ about whether or not that rebel loser's friend is gonna get killed due to your lack of self reserve. Get vaporized at least 50 times in the combine elevators from violent swarms of electric balls launched by your cackling comrades. Lastly, break the shock and awe that resides in the silence of the game's final, time stopping, life endangering, jaw dropping, moments with a subtle ""sometimes I dream about cheese"" sounded off by using your keen dialogue wheel. 99/10			"

												Let's get the story straight. Everyone loves to play together. Half-Life 2 is a great experience to go through by yourself. To play as a character like Gordon Freeman, awake and alive, never selling his soul... In Synergy you are not alone. It's fun to mess around with your friends, while you make your way to the end of the game. I played with a friend. You can play on public servers, or make your own. This can be pretty difficult, cause you need to open some ports. There are guides for that.The game is free! :D You just need Half-Life 2, as a minimum. You can go through the Episodes as well. So why not give it a try?			"

												For those avid HL2 fans out there, I must reccomend Synergy on a raised level. Relive the dramatic and action-installed story of Half-Life, but no longer are you alone as Dr. Gordon Freeman; have a buddy or group of online friends by your side, and together, reconquer the combine in epic battles with tales to tell. And after you've (hopefully) defeated Dr. Breen in HL2, you can move on to HL2:Ep1, HL2:Ep2, and... well... I'm pretty sure it ends there, right? Wait- Synergy... multiple people, possibly 2 including you... add the amount of HL2 games... that's 5. Then, subtract 2, becuase this is only compatible in HL2... AH HA! Half-Life 3 confirmed! But seriously, just get this mod. I can say, I've had quite a lot of fun with it, and no doubt, you will too! (Oh, and do look over your list and be quite sure you own all of the games you wish to play with this mod; you're not getting a free-ride through a mod, you bloody bugger!)			"

												Synergy is one of those little Source mods that can really add a lot of replayability to Half-Life 2. Synergy is simple in what it does - you can play through Half-Life 2 with up to 4(?) friends, but tweaking the maxplayers cvar lets you go up to 16. But that's not all for Synergy. The community have created all sorts of maps for this little mod, most of them being incredibly difficult co-op minigames or objective maps. There are also physics-based puzzle maps where you have your wits and your gravity gun to complete usually around 20 puzzles per map. All of these custom map types are very fun to play, and take Synergy from a co-op Half-Life 2 experience to virtually it's own game. Unfortunately, Synergy hasn't aged well - the server list is very sparsely populated, and there are only a few servers remaining that have any sort of active player base.With that said, if you can get a group of friends together and grab some of the custom-made coop maps, you can have a blast with Synergy. (Quite litteraly, friendly fire is a thing that is toggleable)			"

												This is probably the best mod since Garry's Mod. It makes Half-Life 2 worth 50$ when you can play with up to 9 friends. The developers did an amazing job at making it work great for more than one player. Now, you can even play other HL2 mods and episodes with this mod. Is it perfect? No. but its an amazing way to play the game in a different way.			"

												Allows you to play Half Life 2 in Co-op mode, so you can play your favourite game with your favourite friend or friends! Getting serves up are annoying if you dont know how to port forward, but typically its just go to your router website something like 182.999.111 (EXAMPLE) and just put, allow all Steam Games and you're done! Once you've created an up and running server, you can go from there.N/A Score.This is a mod, and all it does is allow HL2 Co-Op, its not the actual HL2 "

												Hello Fellow Rebels,Of course, I recommend Synergy! A multi-player version of Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode One, and Half-Life 2: Episode Two with some of your Steam friends makes for a great time! There are also several other servers that allow for deathmatch or other game modes! It's a wonderful modification to the great series, although, make sure you have the three games because if you don't, then this game is almost impossible to play as there will be several missing textures! It's a great game, definitely worth the download, especially because it's free!-Kyle James			"

Seems powerful... wait... it only uses 20 bullets... -_- Oh well, again, better than nothing right? OH WAIT WHAT IS THIS! IS THAT, IT IS! It's a MP5k! It's also new! Seems so useful too... powerful, but 15 bullets less than the MP9 you have in HL2. Oh look, new maps! I want to try these out! OH NO WAIT IT'S A DARK HEADCRAB GET ME AWAY *Loud Scream*. *Dissconect*...My reaction to one of the maps. (Only I didn't scream, I jumped. I am manly! (Not really))So, you still wanting more? Fine, I'll add the Pros and Cons. (As usual)PROS:1. Co-op, where else are you gonna find a Source Co-op game that has to do with HL2?2. Looks like it runs on a new Source engine... reminds me of the engine BM:S uses.3. So much fun... just play it.4. Tweaked maps that the creator(s) did.5. New weapons. Seriously, you can't go wrong with that.CONS:1. Sometimes buggy, like the first level (the trainstation), where you can't go up the ladder and jump out the window. Much much bugs, but that's what you have to deal with.2. Wish there was a Gordon Freeman model... oh well, I can wait for Sven Co-Op 2 to come out.3. Very Hard, that's why you have friends!4. Can't think of anything else.All in all, I give it a 9/10. Yes there are bugs, plus it's hard. But all in all, it's a great game. It puts that smile on you when you are sad and want to play with friends.Hope this review helped!			"

												It's a great mod, really fun when you bring a couple friends along the ride. However, one complaint of mine is that the mod made the enemies really tough, and you really weak. If there's only two players, they're gonna be dying constantly, especially in the sections where you have to hold out. Setting the difficulty to easy does not help against that one bit, and it's overall really frustrating. So as i said before, i recommend you play with more than several people, otherwise you're not gonna have a good time.			"

												Best. Half-Life 2. Mod. On. Steam. HANDS DOWN.This mod adds cooperative multiplayer support, while trying to retain the Half-Life 2-like experience. It not only adds coop support for the levels of Half-Life 2, but it also adds coop support for Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Half-Life 2: Lost Coast, MINERVA(: Metastasis), Dangerous World, Calamity, Rock 24, Riot Act: Part I, City 7: Toronto Conflict, and Offshore. Unlike Synergy's competitor, Obsidian Conflict, the fanbase is much larger and always (or at least, almost always) online. There are even servers that offer you the ability to play custom community-made coop maps, along with support for other Half-Life 2 & Episodic Mods, such as Mistake of Pythagoras, Ravenholm, They Hunger Again, Coastline to Atmosphere, The Citizen Returns, Causality Effect, Half-Life: Precursor, and even Half-Life 2: Episode Three - The Closure (<----ew)! There is even an official Steam Workshop page that contains additional community-made coop maps and even reskins of models, textures, and sounds! Plus, it's easy to upload your own content to this workshop (srsly, why doesn't gmod use this method?!)!And another thing! Although it's been quite some time since we saw an update, the devs are currently working on adding support for Black Mesa, Half-Life: Source, and Half-Life 2: Update; so now I'm  really  looking forward to it!

												What game would be the best game to play HL2 with friends? This game. Combine the HL2 campaing with an friend so you can make this more easier and mess around and work together to complete HL2 with your friend or friends. This has to be one of the best HL2 Co-Op Games. I rate 9.5/10 because it has extra weapons.			"

												It's Half Life 2, but you get to watch people who are better at the game than you beat most of the monsters and drive you off of cliffs when you ride with them.Really though, Synergy is a great game. It makes re-playing HL2 worth it, even if you've played it a lot in single-player. Inevitably it almost ends up like a speedrun contest, with all the players vying to be among the first four to the end of the level. Quite an entertaining challenge for someone who's familiar with the game already. I haven't seen many custom maps for the game, but from what I've seen there are some great ones. Plus, c'mon, it's HL2. Even if you're not doing as much as your teammates you can still enjoy being in a Half-Life game.My only serious criticisms (aside from trusting total strangers to help you survive) are thus:--Some levels aren't scaled up in difficulty, so the first few people to the scene get to kill everything and everyone else has to play catch-up.--Healing and kill assists don't count for points on the scoreboard.Though there aren't a lot of servers around for this game, there's usually someone on a server somewhere. Even if there's not, there's enough empty ones around that you can invite a few friends over.Overall, I'd give Synergy an 8.5/10.			"

												Got stuck inside my friend in the pod. Broke all the fonts on the intro to Ep.1 Got stuck in an infinite death cycle on the elevator that also caused my friend to get stuck in a loop. Died 400 times. Friend changed game speed to 9,000,000. Timed out from server. Friend got completely trapped in his own server. Spammed Windows + E. Opened 800 File Explorers. Friend's GPU hit 200 degrees. Friend got mentally scarred for life and is now terrified of all Source Engine games.10/10 Would break HL2 and utterly f*** up everything in the game again.			"

												Rating: 7\10A very smart designed game by valve called Half life 2 was only single player. Until one who felt so great that he made the ultimate Coop experiance for a game that is still famous to this day. Synergy! One of the best coop experiances i have had in a extermly long time made a kick in for my library and made me as happy as can be! Not only you may ask questions on coop options as it has its own. and the air boat and jeep. They are sorted out as much as the setting. Even if there are bugs i still find this Game mod has alot of potential. All and all its a very enjoyable habitat and i would love to see more interested in this.			"

												This mod pretty much plays exactly like the game it's based on, but with Co-op elements. If you want any opinions about the graphics and the gameplay, just simply go look up any Half-Life 2 review. My only gripe with this mod though is it is unstable beyond belief, and for some reason some of my settings don't stay saved (could be just on my end though). If they cleaned up the updates better than they do and make the game at least stable, I would recommend this a lot more.Overall (TL;DR), this game isn't a bad idea and is actually pretty fun (especially with friends), but in the current state it's in at the time of writing this review, it feels rather unfinished despite it being on Steam for a long-♥♥♥ time.

Dá até 10 amigos, entao imagine jogar com todos eles, a zuera vai ser 2much. Os probleminhas são que você precisa de Half-Life 2, e seus amigos também.

												This mod is one of the worst coop mods I have played in a long time. There are so many reasons why I think this mod is bad but heres a few.Unfair enemy placementExtremely high health for enemys and bossesLOTS of Bugs which include lose of the gravity gun if you die, glitched animations for weapons, glitched vehicles that include not being able to enter the vehicle, bugged controls of the vehicle, these are only some bugs that reoccured a lot while I was playing the game.What could be done with this mod? If the creator fixed a lot of these bugs and glitches within the game and also would allow for a more fun time with the half life 2 campaign which would be allowing difficulties more then just the hard difficulties that the creators included. Also if you are wondering the server side of things did not contribute to the rating of this mod.			"

												The game itself is a great mod, works well.It's just limiting that it comes with no special maps of its own, since you seem to need HL2:Ep1-2 for the ones that allegedly do come with the game (ultimately meaning that all I have at the moment are HL2:Ep0 maps), and there aren't many good maps online made for this game. I guess I'll just have to wait for Sven Co-Op to revert to what it was and just play that for now.			"

												Name: SynergyPrice: Free (if you own half life 2)Rating: Worth PlayingSynergy is a mod for half life 2. The game runs very smoothly and looks like half life 2. What this mod is about is that you play through half life 2 with your friends or other random people. You can have up to 18 players in one server. If you own just cause 2 then you probally know that just cause 2 has a multiplayer mod. This game is like that only that this isnt just cause 2 its half life 2.

												have you ever wanted to explore the Half-life series with a friend? well with this free mod for hl2 (find in store), you can play with 10 friends in all of the half life series past half-life 2. this is reasonably free becasue you need the game of your choice in order to play with friends. i would give this game a rating of 9/10 the reason it isnt 10/10 is becasue the servers are a bit wacked up and you cannot make a private one and have your friend join via message. but this game is perfect for a LAN party.
