												As of the recent patch, Rockstar ruined the game for everyone for literally no reason. The patch, which is MANDATORY to play the game through Steam now, replaced the original game with the garbage ""HD"" mobile port that was released on the Xbox 360, which;-removes 18 songs (""Critical Beatdown"", ""Running Down A Dream"", ""Woman To Woman"", ""You Dropped A Bomb On Me"", ""Yum Yum"", ""Running Away"", ""I Don't Give A f*ck"", ""Express Yourself"", ""Killing in the Name of"", ""Hellraiser"", ""Ring My Bell"", ""Personal Jesus"", ""Don't Let It Go To Your Head"", ""Rock Creek Park"", ""Grunt"", ""Soul Power '74"" and ""The Payback"")-revokes all mods created for San Andreas on PC-deletes all of your previous save files-removes 1280x700 resolution-has various textures missing and things like foilage completely removedThis update does nothing but suggest that no GTA game on Steam is safe from future backstabbing, downgrading, game breaking updates and I am truly ashamed that I gave my money to Rockstar for this game which not only I, but a plethora of fans love to death.This is a cancerous update and I highly recommend you get a physical copy of the game or get a download somewhere else of v1 or v1.1, because this is disgusting coming from Rockstar. If you already own the game on Steam, then immedietely write a bad review for this game and complain to Rockstar Games about this.EDIT: As of 26th February, Rockstar still haven't said a word about this and have delayed GTA V on PC for the third time to improve their quarterly sales report. They sure seem to care about the consumer.			"

												San Andreas is one of my all-time favorite games, and for very good reason. It's a fantastic entry to the series, with enough content to keep you occupied for weeks. That's not even including the highly populated and still, very much alive multiplayer mod (SA-MP) and the plethora of other mods you can obtain for this amazing game. However, since Rockstar is so hell-bent on ruining the PC user's experience, I can't recommend the Steam release of this game. The latest patch has removed a number (18, to be specific) of key songs from the once fantastic soundtrack. There is still no 1080p support. Previous save files will no longer work and you -will- more than likely crash if you are playing this game with a dual-monitor set up. Although despite these downgrades, at least they were 'kind enough' to implement very basic Xinput support, so you can play it with a controller. Woo.Rockstar has all the right to do this. The removal of once available songs makes sense due to copyright reasons. You can't exactly sell your product when it contains content you no longer have the license to use, let alone monetize. But when the game is deliberately patched to take away content that users have already paid for, and to hinder the experience once again, you're just hurting your PC fanbase. Which, I suppose is nothing new if you've played any PC release of Grand Theft Auto post-GTA3.The best way to enjoy this game is to purchase a retail copy. It'll probably be cheaper, it'll look good on your shelf, you can mod it by default all you want, and you won't have any of your content patched out without warning. With that said. Don't bother buying any other GTA games on Steam either. If they've already removed content in one title, then expect it again in the future from other installments of the franchise when licenses inevitably expire, or can no longer be obtained. TL;DR: Great game but ruined by Rockstar's anti-consumer attitude. Go buy it elsewhere for the full experience.			"

												This is a ground breaking release that I own on PS2 and PC. It increased the scale of the previous GTA games and introduced addictive RPG game mechanics into the series. Samuel L Jackson as officer Tenpenny is some of the best celeb casting in a video game ever. This is a game that precedes the dumbing down of AAA gaming, where the mass market was encouraged to enjoy a complex and sometimes difficult title.Sadly, I can't recommend the game in its current state. Rockstar has decided to gimp the soundtrack by removing several important songs that contributed to the atmosphere while roaming open world. This would be a hard sell even if they only did this to new customers, but in my case they have removed songs that were once in the game that I paid for. The situation is unacceptable. It underpins the ridiculousness of license agreements, when they make a title worse for all the paying customers, while leaving those who download the title illegaly with the experience as it was originally intended.

Did he just get an epiphany of his OG lifestyle and is thinking about going to art school? Why is he wearing socks with sandals? How can we see that he's wearing socks with sandals if hes in his car? Why are we, a gang in the corner of a burger joint, questioning this man enjoying some tunes in his ride? Then the gangsters walked away in silence and became philosophers. But dat music tho.			"

You done ♥♥♥♥ed up, RockStar. First you go and do ♥♥♥♥in' around with GTA5 (still waiting on those heists), then exclusive♥♥♥♥♥♥with the PC and ""Next-Gen"" versions (GTA5 again), and now with this update.

												Ok first off, this is one the best GTA games because it is the longest GTA with over 30 hours of storyline and you have 3 cities to explore unlike other GTA games where you're just stuck in one city and best of all there are RPG elements to it that give this game a big + from all the other GTA games. The cities you get to explore are Los Santos which is based on Los Angeles and does a really good job with detailing the area and putting the ghetto into it and makes you feel like you actually live in the hood. You have the countryside between Los Santos and San Fierro and feels like you live in California with its lush forests. San Fierro which is based on San Francisco also does a good job and feels like a believable Bay Area city, The dessert between San Fierro and Las Venturas feels like a realistic mojave desert and is perfect(especially if you're a fallout fan) to explore. Las Venturas is based on Las Vegas and does an amazing job with its neon lights and casinos to make it a realstic metropolis. The game mechanics in this game are very heavliy improved from Vice City because you can now see your target's health and driving feels more loose in SA. You have gang wars which are pretty fun and lets you recruit your own gang members and take over other hoods by playing a little survival mini game. The soundtrack is amazing in this game and is very believable and feels you are actually living in the 90's and is my second favorite soundtrack after Vice City. Oh and using the jetpack is so much fun. Now the flaws on this game is that even though GTA SA is challenging it is also has very tedious missions, especially missions that involve using an airplane. Those missions are terrible, not fun at all and have the worst controls that I have ever seen in a video game. The story is flawed in many ways too and there is some character flaws here and there but the story isn't bad at all and it's very deep. The characters are also memorable too and good voice acting from Samuel L. mutha♥♥♥♥in Jackson. Yes he plays the main antagonist which also gives this game another +. Like I said earlier, this game is challenging and tedious at times but it's very rewarding and that's what makes a good video game. This I would say would be my favorite GTA game after Vice City and this game was worth playing through till the end and is a masterpiece.			"

												I want to recommend this game but i can't. This game is amazing for many reasons. It feels nostalgic... familiar. Or at least DID.... but here is the thing;BOOM, 10 years later, Rockstar decides to update the game. I was pretty surprised myself.Worst update ever.Save files are broken, they removed multiple songs and resolutions.And that sh""tty mobile port.Now i know most of the negative reviews consist of the new update and so on. But my complaint is modding. THEY COMPLETELY REMOVED MODDING. Now i know GTA SA on steam was never mod friendly, but there was a way to mod it anyways, and i was happy. Why Rockstar? Why would you remove modding capabilites? You removed the ability to play SAMP! Why? The best thing ever!I read a review a couple months back suggesting adding Steam Workshop to this game. GREAT IDEA.Now Rockstar, would you please tell us why you came back 10 years later to break the game, but can't add Steam Workshop after MULTIPLE REQUESTS?As i said, i woud've highly recommended this game a while back, but for now, i feel like i just got robbed.Get your sh""t together Rockstar.Sorry for english mistakes, it is not my primary language.-SpTmBrThanks :) "

With that, even users who had purchased the game long ago are now stuck with an even poorer port of the game, fewer songs in the game's soundtrack, and paltry graphics/resolution options.Rockstar has perfectly exploited and demonstrated all of the real and perceived flaws of a digital distribution platform.

Grand Auto IV was best game for me but this is legendary too, it's hard to believe how Rockstar Games made huge and awesome game like this back in 2004. This game rocks for long time and i will never forget this classic when im older. Everything in this game is perfectly made and finished, if you got bored you can always do some cheats to have fun and tons of mods just adds playing.

												What can I say about this game? One of my first GTA... and one of my favorites. I will always love this game. Great story and a very large world (in 2005 it was cool) and a lot of opportunities and freedom of action. Lots of interesting (and not) missions, as well as many other interesting places. I could continue to describe this game... but better to play it and rate it. Thank you RockStar for this wonderful game.			"

												GTA San Andreas in general is a classic game no doubt, but this release is truly a horrible port. It took nearly 10 years for Rockstar to add true controller support (November 2014) and even that is mediocre at best. It's worthy to note that in the November 2014 patch, Rockstar disenfranchised its current customers by unnecessarily removing content and apparently stripping out higher resolutions options. The patch also caused the in-game graphics to appear worse (though this could just be isolated to my experience). Overall, the steam version of GTA San Andreas is more like the ""Frankenstein version” and I wouldn't recommend it to those seeking the authentic GTA San Andreas experience. If you don't mind your game constantly transforming on you, then I suppose this version may be for you. Rockstar's track record of poor GTA PC releases undoubtedly continues with their latest revision of this great game.Recommended Fixes/ModsFor those who already own GTA: San Andreas on Steam, you should consider installing ""Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - Enhanced Edition"" mod per the Steam User Guide:

												Well not much to say about this game anymore after the update. Read below why you should not buy it anymore.BEFORE THE UPDATE:- Vanilla GTA- Mod support where no problem. ( i could actaully add my things to the game without it crashed at loading)- Well all the best songs where there.- I enjoyed this game so freaking much.AFTER THE UPDATE:- The game can't even load when you run it the first time and has sat everything on fullest( i need to play this game in the lowest res now, untill the first mission is done and has been saved, then i can change graphics)- Songs need- the game can't load half my mods anymore.    - If you are like me that needs to run Oblivion and SRT 3 this game is not for you on steam the Exe file doesn't allow major changes or multiple exes for each mod, this makes it impossible for me to test the new U-boats i made and several planes as they somehow now uses more memory than the steam version allows - i've given up trying to find some fixes for this game- oh yeah and the mouse keeps disabeling itself now, so you got to go to the main menu use the mouse a bit and then get back into the game.I love GTA SA and have more than about 500 hours of gameplay and even more testing mods i make. but the steam version dont work correctly. ( in the off steam version, dont include my steam game time, that is only the hours the game spent crashing and causing problems)			"

												Growing up as a white kid in a non-white neighborhood, I got a lot of bikes stolen from me. I would say over the course of my life I've had about 10-12 bikes stolen. This used to make me really sad, but in GTA San Andreas I got to role play stealing a bike from a white kid and riding off into the sunset with it. I had no idea it was so much fun to steal bikes from white kids. Now that GTA taught this to me I'm not sad about all my lost bikes, because I know how much joy stealing them from me brought to other people.			"

This is a great example why there should be a downgrade/no updates option on steam.

												Now before I start here: Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a really good game. I love it to the point where I own both the physical copy and the Steam version.But recently, Rockstar made a patch that is just absolutely unacceptable.Here's what they did:Adds Xinput controller support (Xbox 360 controllers)Now this is good. But it's the only good thing about the patch.Makes “Steering with Mouse” enabled by defaultThis is an odd choice but usually I'd let a quirky design choice like this slide as long as it's toggleable.Removes several songs from *all owners* and from future purchases (the same ones that were removed in the mobile version)Even if certain licenses expired, it doesn't excuse outright removing certain songs from the game. The physical and retail versions still have them, are they gonna get banned globally now? Of course not.Removes several resolution options, including 1920×1080This is the worst part of all. How the ♥♥♥♥ can anyone defend this? At least with the last part I could kinda see where they were coming from copyright-wise, but they're straight-up removing features from the game for absolutely no reason.Loading a saved game starts a new oneAgain, absolutely unacceptable. What good does it do to literally break the save feature of a game?Final verdict: Please, if you haven't played it already, either buy it physically or pirate an older version of it. This version is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that no consumer should ever deal with. Rockstar is never getting another penny from me, and it's such a shame that I need to do this with GTA V coming out on PC soon, but I cannot support any companies who think it's a good idea to literally REMOVE CONTENT FROM YOUR GAME FOR ABSOLUTELY NO ♥♥♥♥ING REASON. ♥♥♥♥ YOU ROCKSTAR.

												By its impact and overall features complexity, the greatest Grand Theft Auto title ever made. Yeah, even after the GTA V PC release. How's that, you may ask? Since when some junk based on the engine dated like 15 years away, is better than all the licked clean and glossy Euphoria engine stuff?Well, Euphoria is a good engine, sure, but not perfect. It's great with some physical effects, and all... But some things it can't do, while its competitors - can. Like when you need to exit the car and the doors are blocked, Euphoria still just respawns you outside the car. And Wei Shen from Sleeping Dogs will exit the car like he should - by smashing the front window with a kick and climbing out on the hood! And that's only one example! If you look around, you'll find many cool options that Rockstar haven't implied in their games, and that's really sad!But not when we're talking about San Andreas. For its main selling point at the moment is obviously not the visuals or engine complexity. No, people, it's all about the spirit, the mood that the game is providing. San Andreas - it's a raging youth, a bit crazy but overmighty and unstoppable. GTA 4 and GTA 5 - are quite different, and much more grim and unattractive by the same basis - the mood game's providing. Yeah, Luiz from the ""ballad of Gay Tony "" and Franklin from GTA V are slightly more cheerful guys you'll might even roll with someday... But Niko Bellic, Johnny Klebitz, Michael and Trevor - especially Trevor - they're all so horrid guys that I wouldn't like to walk the same road with. And it's the same thing as with the character from Mafia 1 in comparison with characters from Mafia 2 & 3! I just don't like those guys, I don't feel compassion for them - so I don't like to help them with sorting out their troubles, and so on.So there is the thing why San Andreas is better than GTA V. Compassion. Sympathy. Carl Johnson, being just the same mass murdering criminal as the whole other bunch of Rockstar characters, is still a better person to hang out with.And talking about the technical side, San Andreas even by the year of 2004 is tremendously big game. I've played it in 2005, in 2008, in 2011 and only the 4th time through I've found the triathlon event there. Stunning feeling.So, my mark is obvious 10/10, and not of some nostalgia, but just as the feeling after I've made it through GTA V, which I'll mark lower. Peace, people.			"

												This is, perhaps, the best GTA game in the history of the franchise. I think that pretty much anybody who's ever played GTA knows about this game, and I'd dare to say that, in most cases, this is the one people remember the most. While the other games from the 3D era were pretty good as well (I'll always have a soft spot for Vice City, which was my first GTA ever), this one takes the cake. Rather than being limited to a single city, like previous games (or a bunch of cities divided in levels, like the original GTA), this one's set in an entire state, with three large cities (Los Santos, San Fierro and Las Venturas), a bunch of small towns, and lots of countryside to explore.The game feels HUGE. And it's not just a big map that's pretty much empty unless it's a plot-essential area. You can easily go around exploring and find places with great detail (for the time) that are completely irrelevant to the plot; in fact, there's large areas of the map that you'll never go to if you only focus on the story, and this includes some small towns. Still, they're there, to make the world feel alive. When it comes to the main cities, they're pretty good, and, again, there's lots of details here and there to make them feel like scaled-down versions of the real cities they're based in.The gameplay is what you'd expect from GTA. There's shooting, there's carjacking, all the good ol' GTA stuff. However, this game was the first in the series to introduce some light-RPG elements. Not only could you customize the way CJ looked by changing his clothes and haircut, but you could also make him fat, or have him train at the gym making him stronger and learning new combat moves. And his skill with vehicles and weapons could improve as well the more you used them. There's also tons of side missions and activities besides the main plot, including the classic odd jobs like Vigilante on Paramedic, and a few new ones as well.The storyline of the game is great. It begins with CJ returning to the hood after 5 years, and, like many GTA games, it's a story of working your way up from the bottom. However, what makes this one stand out in my opinion is that it isn't only about the rise of a powerful criminal, but it's also about family and friendship. Pretty well written, with some serious moments, along with some great humour. Not to mention a lot of references and callbacks to previous games from the 3D era.The ""soundtrack"", or rather the in-game radio stations are pretty good; there's a wide variety of genres, and the actual soundtrack played during cutscenes and such is good as well. Not to mention that you can add your own music for the radio stations, so you can always listen to something you like while playing.Well, I think that's pretty much everything I've got to say about GTA:SA. I really recommend it, as it is one of my favourite GTA games, and the one I played the most (both on the PS2 and on PC).			"

												Somewhere, someone in Rockstar Studios decided to ""update"" their game, nearly ten years after release, to make it ultimately inferior - a worse product. They removed songs, replaced textures, removed details, and generally downgraded it. They decided to take away developers from certain development teams (such as the Grand Theft Auto V development team) to make this version worse.This is absolutely and completely stupid. I beg of you to not purchase this product, and, if you already own it, to write a poor review for it to inform Rockstar Studios of their mistake so that this version may, possibly, be fixed. I want only the best version of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas to be on Steam. This is truly a fantastic game, though this is a poor version.			"

												Heya. This game will  guarantee an authentic groove life experience. The way you make contact with this life, it's one of a kind. It's not all about thugs, drugs, thefting and many others like these. It becomes really funny when you discover such a large world, a replica of early '90 years, in which you can transform this game into a role-play one. You will feel me after you will play it. They brushed every single object, excluding the sky-scrapers. You can even enter in some gigantic boats of army.I bought this game for almost 3 euros. I did because it was the game I was obsessed to play when I was younger, like 4 years ago. I even gifted few to my friends. This game has been a massive impact upon Action Games; a tremendous jump from GTA Vice City; no one would have expected such a real game.Now some particular issues:Pro:- huge map; so well detalied;- plenty of characters you will make contact with;- variety of vehicles(tanks, choppers, boats, cars, bicycles)- many missions, all achievable;- sound track, voice lines between characters;- weather types, all again neat;- good radio stations, well suited to that period;- you can find more by playing it.:Cons:- nothin' ;- just to fill this space- this game has lost its delight because many gamers now play only by their attention given to graphics details. I know it's an old game. Still, you don't know it untill you don't play it.All in all, shall you ask yourself if you should buy this game? No, just do it right away. It's not expensive, not by a strecth. It's a neat game, it calls you! Buy it and play some SA-MP with your colleagues, this is the most epic childhood for an early-gamer.Cheers!			"

												This isn't a real review, just a reminder: Rockstar in the last patch removed content from the game, even from people who already bought it. Just by the songs they were removed I think it's enough to not have the same experience. 1080p deleted, glitches, mod support broken, save files pre-patch don't work anymore.Consider looking into the PS2, Original Xbox or retail physical version of the game. Avoid Steam version. Yeah, hurts to say that.			"

I simply got  NO WORDS  to describe that immense and wonderful feeling. Just as stealing a Jet Pack from the Restricted Area and flying all the way across  San Fierro , watching the gorgeous sunset intensified on the  Tierra Robada . San Andreas is not a simple-made video game, it is an epoch-making step in the game industry, it is an art and it is a special box full of memories; blended with its own atmosphere -both visual and auditory. This is a  special  game, folks, seriously, a ♥♥♥♥ing special and a cult game for the generation that can be called my own. And lastly, ♥♥♥♥ you, Ryder.			"

												My god! It's been almost 10 years since this game was released! That was quite a long time ago. And to see it released after Vice City it was a big deal. Seriously, the game employed at least 10 times the area Vice City had. And here there are 3 different cities available not to mention the countryside in between these. This game is huge and just by completing all side missions you can easily go over a 100 hours of gameplay time!This game still did not have any physics as in order to get the next gen feeling we needed to wait for the 4th instalment of the franchise. But this is not a problem as in case you look at it as Vice City's successor you can appreciate what San Andreas offers: greater playable area, hundreds of vehicles, minigames, car modifications, gang wars and the ability to purchase clothing, tattoos and even to have your own haircut.I had only an issue with the game's RPG elements: for some reason some stunts are not available at first and you need to keep driving a car until you unlock the next level. To be able to sprint further or have stronger punches in melee you need to visit the gym often. From time to time you need to eat but junk food will soon make you obese. So you need to visit the gym again. These side activities stole some of my time and I never liked paying any attention to them but I had to. I liked how these were skipped in the next episode which, unfortunately, skipped the car modifications and this is the only GTA with bikes in it! And to date, in my opinion, this game has used the best voice actors in the series: Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Penn, Ice T and James Woods just to name a few. This is a classic and if you like the ""old"" GTA games but for some reason skipped this one now is to time to purchase it. Or when it's discounted as 10 bucks is a bit too much for such a title but I'm sure the price will soon drop.			"

												Easily the best Grand Theft Auto, in my opinion. It has everything you could want in a GTA game. Gun variety, decent story, likeable characters, a nice balance between city, country, and desert, etc. There are also nice smaller touches, such as eating and being able to get fat, or not eat and get skinny over time. San Andreas also gives you the option to work out, an activity that has been abesnt to every other Grand Theft Auto since it's debut in San Andreas. The cities are one of the best parts of the game as well, IMO. You have the gang infested ghettos that is Los Santos, based off the real life Los Angeles. Red County and Flint County are your country sides, from Mount Chilliad and the Back o' Beyond to the small towns of Palomino Creek and Montomery. San Fiero, based off the real life San Francisco, has your fair share of narrow streets and steep hills, as well as some of the more interesting missions in the game. The final city unlocked in the game is Las Venturas, as well as the neighboring desert that is Bone County. Although your time in Bone County is short, you will experience some cool missions, some interesting individuals, and the dreading pilot school missions. Las Venturas on the other hand really shakes up the gameplay compared to the rest of the game, in terms of mission variety. Though Las Venturas has many sights to see, you'll likely be spending most of your time in the Strip.The only real cons with this game rest with the fact that some of the radio music has been removed because of licensing issues, and planes can be pretty tough to control unless you plan on playing with a controller. This is one of my favorite games of all time and I don't think I wouldn't recommend it anyone.			"

Well done, Rockstar...I have a lot of play time in this game and the latest update is rather depressing.What happened?It seems that Rockstar have decided to ruin this game by introducing a new patch which, quite essentially, breaks the game. Numerous songs have been removed from the game for licensing reasons (why not only remove them for new purchases?) and widescreen support is apparently gone as well as some resolution options?I managed to pause the download and create a backup of the game, I think I've lost the songs but I still have an old, slightly-modded exe which allows for 16:9 at 1080p and most importantly: the ability to load my old saves.What Rockstar did was callous, and unforgivable. This will definitely harm consumer confidence, but they probably don't even care.As much as I want to get GTA: V, I'll probably avoid it or wait until it's on sale a few years down the line. I mean, can we really trust Rockstar? What next? They downgrade GTA: IV?If you want to find out more about the latest patch, read the other reviews that go into detail and provide a removed song list.Also, if you really are thinking about buying this game, I wouldn't blame you if you ""find"" it available somewhere around the internet (I don't even support piracy, but in this case I'll make an exception).

												Thanks a lot, Rockstar. You had a great game and now you've ruined it. You can't just switch a good version of the game with the mobile one and say it's okay. Where are my 16:9 resolutions? Where are my songs? I payed for that, you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.I'm not buying your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games anymore.Don't buy this♥♥♥♥♥♥ This version is not feature complete. Play it on PS2, or find the good version through other means.			"

												It's a great game, but damn the latest patch puts a sour taste in ones mouth. Rockstar removed radio tracks due to liscensing issues. Admitedly these changes are pretty minor, but they're in conflict with the game's core remaining audience.It's an old game. Folks who play old games like the idea of those games staying the way they were or not changing without their direct involvment (i.e. content/graphic mods). Furthermore, when they do make changes to their games they generally put content in rather than take it out as Rockstar has done here.On the side of rationality though, fans will probably unofficialy patch those tracks back in eventually and this version of the game now has 360 controller support. So it's kind of a mixed bag. If it still really bothers you, then there is always the retail  pc version which has been floating on the internet since 2005.			"

												So yeah, this Steam version is really bad. I can't mod the damn game, so I can't play SA-MP if i wanted to because its not supported due to this stupid mandatory update. 18 songs have been removed, most of the resolution support is gone, and save files are deleted. What's funny is that they finally decided to update the game after 10 YEARS! I have an old CD copy of the game and guess what? Has everything they took away from us. I got my money back and I'm just using my old copy of the game in which is still in perfect condition. Don't buy this game on Steam, either find a copy on Ebay, or pirate the damn thing because this version is not worth it.			"

												If you touch the wall with the front of your car very gently, then your whole bumper/hood cames off.Pulling out camera at Police Departament is more punished than murdering two policemans with knife.You have police radio in your head.You are eating your food immediatley at the cash desk.Even after drinking thousands of Sprunk cans, you wont need to pee.You cannot have spray can and camera at the same time with you. Police is not going to react if somebody is shooting at you, they will react only after you are going to shoot back. First blackskinned character in the series, gets arrested before the game even starts.You can't just drink one beer, you always have to get drunk like a pig, even with a girlfriend you wanna impress.When you shoot at the trees, sparks are pouring off of it.Your fatso friend shoots everywhere but not at the enemies then says its all your fault that you didn't catch them all.Even a dirty, drunk, stinking old hobo will drop clean, new packs of money after death.You are just a guy from poor neighbourhood, but you can use military jets and hellicopters. Even a rocket launcher cannot destroy a bike.You visit hospital only after you die.Enemy gang member with baseball bat will attack you while you are sitting in a tank with two uzi machine pistols.You can easily walk next to counter terrorists while having minigun in your hands.After installing proper mod, your girlfriend can invite you for a coffee and then licks your pants.You are escaping from the FBI in panties, then you are putting off your hand watch and nobody recognizes you anymore.                                10/10, nostalgia + Korl Dżansyn.

Posted: September 28, 2014
												My childhood mostly consisted of drawing, stuffing my face with sweets and of course, the PS2. At that time, I was given two games, both in the same series, being GTA: Vice City and of course, GTA: San Andreas which was pretty new for it's time. I instantly fell in love with both games, what with both of the game's poop-crazy storylines, well developed and memorable characters and of last but not least, the multiple crimes that will rack up those classic wanted stars! Sadly, I had lost this game a while back, due to moving and such and I was absolutely devastated. Looking for an alternative, I stumbled across Steam, with it's little miracle of putting the entire GTA series bundle on sale for an unbelieveably cheap price.	 I immediately smashed £20 into my steam wallet and hastefully slammed that purchase button and I've never looked back. This game astonished me, what with it's massive and immense game world it has. The chunk of data on that one compact disc still amazes me to this day.Going back to the hood, as Carl 'CJ' Johnson a young representant of the Grove Street Families, an African-American street gang and one of the oldest street gangs in Los Santos, San Andreas. ''After five years on the east coast, it was time to go home.'' was the exact words from CJ's mouth, as he arrived to pick up his luggage at the L.S Airport. His motive remaining clear, after he received a call before the planned flight from his older brother, detailing that their mother had been murdered by a mysterious hustler. Giving a warm welcome by his grieving older brother and sister, along with his two Grove Street comrades, Big Smoke and Ryder, you soon find yourself spraying graffiti, drive-by shooting, exploring the far and wide sprawling sun-drenched state of San Andreas, popping some caps in the asses of the corrupt ''bustas'', and of course putting other sworn rival gangs in their place.The gameplay on foot is top-notch. Interactivity with NPC's and overworld objects are very simple and the character animations are clear and very personified. Though the driving in this game is what I found a little problematic, what with the controls being a little messed up, but it's hardly noticeable over the irresistable charm the game has at it's repetoire.I definitely recommend a controller for this game. Since, it's argueable to say that again, I found the controls somewhat 'sloppyish' and a little finicky, with just using a mouse and keyboard.  All the while it does feel just right when using a PS3 controller, if you can wire that up to your PC's controller port. Truly adds to the nostalgic flare, since the reminiscence of both the Dualshock 2 and 3 controller.The only problem I've recently discovered is that a notorious patch has bestowed upon this classic game, thanks to Rockstar and now I believe that this game is now unmoddable and a handful of songs have been removed due to legal copyright reasons, which kinda sucks now.Now looking back, I still do recommend this game, but not so much for Steam now. Definitely either get it on the Playstation Store or the Xbox Live Marketplace.			"

												And then 2004 came, after 2001's GTA III and 2002's Vice City, the time came for San Andreas county to make his appereance. In GTA: San Andreas you will play as Carl ""CJ"" Johnson, one of GTA's most infamous protagonists. He comes back to Los Santos after he received a call telling him his mother died, and that's exactly where the story starts. In this new installment released in 2004 you will play not in one, not two but in three different cities located in San Andreas county: Los Santos which is modeled after Los Angeles, San Fierro which is modeled after San Francisco and Las Venturas, modeled after Las Vegas. Yes, Las Vegas got GTA'd and it's awesome. The San Andreas map was a huge achievement when it was released as it was one of the biggest the videogaming industry had ever seen until that point. But what was most surprising was that it was not as empty as one would believe, the map had several side-missions and activities to do. You could modify your character and make him fat, muscular or skinny. You could date girls. You could fight gang wars. You could rob houses. You could go to the gym. You could race in bikes. Or you could simply continue the story missions. As usual as with the other games, San Fierro and Las Venturas are blocked at the start, making Los Santos the only available area until you advanced through the story missions you could unlock the new areas and you could travel there. Otherwise you'd get a really nice 5 Stars Wanted Level if you dared to cross to the blocked areas. One of the most notable differences from previous videogames was the addition of an ability to the protagonist, and that was swimming. For the first time in GTA history a character could swim. Tommy Vercetti couldn't, Claude couldn't but CJ did it! Either way, this is one of the most fun installments in GTA history, rivaling the newest counterpart GTA V. If you don't have this game in your library, then you should by all means save to get this. Are you ready to order? Don't let Big Smoke order first or he's gonna empty the restaurant! 10/10Buy it, play it and don't regret it.			"

												I actually don't write any reviews and especially not bad ones, but this move of Rockstar touched one of my most loved games.I would seriously recommend this game to you, but after the latest update (Yeah ... an update after almost 10 years) they just F*UCKED it up ... YES THEY DID!So basically they ''updated'' al lot of stuff in the last patch. In my opinion they just removed a ton of stuff like almost 10% of the orignal music, your previous save-games (even no luck if you have a back-up, It keeps starting a new game), 1080p support and the list goes on...Lucky for me I still got an old CD copy of the game from back in the days with the first version on it. If you are thinking of buying this game... get a used one from eBay or at a used game store, only then its stil worth for your money.			"

												Nice going, Steam/Rockstar, removing EVERY review for this game after a lot of negative reviews were posted. That's not censorship and damage control at all.Well, San Andreas is one of the best games ever. The Steam version of San Andreas IS NOT the game you played ten years ago though. This would certainly be a positive review, if not for the latest patch (November 7th 2014). That update has REMOVED 18 songs (including tracks from NWA, 2Pac, Rage Against The Machine, Ozzy Osbourne and Tom Petty) and HD support from a game you owned for years. Yes, you read that right. A patch removed content you PAID FOR when you bought the game. That such a thing is legal and was allowed by Steam, says a lot about the current state of the game industry. It sets a very dangerous precedent.Not only that, but the patch has also pretty much changed the game into the iOS/Android version - buggy, often crashing, with low resolution - and yet, bugginess is not as bad as REMOVAL OF CONTENT.While the game is pretty much the Game of the Decade for the '00s, I CANNOT with a pure conscience recommend it to anyone in the current state of affairs. I'd even go as far as saying that Rockstar has fallen down from one of the best game devs to EA-level.			"

												San Andreas is a third game in ""3D Universe"" which was heavily based on real-life events such as rivalry between Crips, Bloods and Hispanic gangs, crack epidemic, Los Angeles riots and severe police misconduct in LAPD which involved unprovoked beatings and shootings, stealing and dealing narcotics, planting of false evidence, frameups and bank robbery. It is one of the rare games that features black character as main protagonist. Besides San Andreas, I can only remember that The Suffering and GTA V did it.Map is almost four times bigger than its predecessor, and consists of 3 big urban areas Los Santos, San Fierro and Las Venturas which are inspired by Los Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas respectively. Countryside in game effectively serves as a 4th area due to its large size and diversity. There are many recognizable landmarks (which are named different) such as Area 51, Hollywood sign, Hoover Dam, Golden Gate bridge and many others.You play as Carl ""CJ"" Johnson, who returns to Las Santos after spending five years in Liberty City when he hears about his mother's murder. He finds his life very hard immediately upon arriving. Relationship with his brother ""Sweet"" is cold since he accuses him of leaving the family and friends. Crack addiction has affected many in his neighbourhood, and on top of that he gets on Frank Tenpenny's radar, a corrupt LAPD C.R.A.S.H. officer. Situation is grim, and he decides to rejoin his former gang, to get brother's approval and help making things better.Whole getto vibe and jargon are omnipresent, they are delivered through excellently written dialogs and voice acting. Besides CJ's Groove Street Families, other gangs include their arch enemies Ballas, Vagos and later in the game Vietnamese Da Nang Boys, Triads, Russians and three families of Italian Mafia.Gang wars becomes a thing later in the game when you need to defend your territory when enemy gang tries to take over. If you successfully do it, members of your gang will hang out in the area, and you can recruit them for helping you in missions. Stealth elements are also incorporated from Rockstar's previous game Manhunt; there are couple of missions which were specifically made with stealth in mind.Role-playing elements are new part of the series. You can visit the gym and learn hand-to-hand combat, work on your stamina by running or driving bike and build up your muscles by lifting weights. It has effect on your appearance which is important because you can date girls, and not all of them love the same thing. Muscles will open you a way to some of them, while others won't appreciate it at all, so you'll have to visit fast food restaurant to gain some fat. You can customize your looking by getting different haircuts, clothes, jewellry and tattoos.RPG elements that have effect on the gameplay are in driving and handling firearms. The more you drive certain type of vehicle or use specific weapon, the more you excel at it.Swimming and diving are also introduced, so you don't have to be afraid of water anymore. You can even pilot a plane after acquiring license for it. Bicycle, offroad vehicles such as tractors and combine harvesters, even jetpack and using parachutes are now on the table. There are driving, bike, boat and pilot schools which will help you learn many tricks.For those who love to hunt for hidden stuff, there is a plethora of it. Original 100 hidden packages are replaced with spray paint tags, but in addition to them there are hidden camera shots, horseshoes and oysters which will keep you preoccupied.My favorite side activities in the game were definitely street races and trucker missions. There are over twenty street races and they include cars, bikes and aircrafts. You are given specific vehicle for each of them and you compete against 5 AI opponents. They are absent in aircraft races, they just consist of getting through checkpoints in a certain amount of time.Eight trucking missions are separated into three types; delivering cargo within certain time limit, delivering illegal cargo whilst being pursued by a police with a three or four star rating and delivering a fragile cargo without damaging it. There are eight missions in total that successively become harder by having tighter time limits, stronger police attention or easily damaged cargo, all that by covering larger areas to reach destination. Last two missions are combination of fragile and timed objects as well as police attention, and can be quite challenging.There are 11 radio stations in the game with over 10 hours of material. My favovite one is WCTR; Rockstar is always spot on with satire used in talk shows and advertisements, laughing is therefore guaranteed.Voice cast lineup is led by phenomenal Samuel L. Jackson who gives voice to main antagonist. William Fichtner and Danny Dyer reprise their roles from Vice City as Ken Rosenberg and Kent Paul, while the rest of the cast include James Woods, David Cross, Peter Fonda, Wil Wheaton and many famous rappers.Game has sold over 27 million copies by 2011 and remains best-selling PS2 game of all time. It has been remastered and ported to many other platforms. It is the last game in ""3D Universe"", Rockstar launched a new canon (""HD Universe"") with GTA IV and GTA V.			"

												I know I've only played this game for 2.6 hours currenly when writing this review. Besides that this game when i started playing it again brought back so many childhood memories when i would play on ps2 and original xbox. This games is a very juicy and rich storyline from you doing driveby shootings to bouncing in your lowrider you have. You can do anything in this game within the boundries but people think gta is just a game where you can have sexx with hookers, run them over and kill cops.

												I have had many memories playing this game on the PlayStation 2. And I know the game is great, but this Steam port is a little damn sketchy. Let me break it down.-CLEO mods seem to be unsupported. (crashes the game upon savegame load)-The User Tracks do NOT work. (this crashes the game during gameplay)-Random crashes upon themselves.-A bunch of other problemsMoral of the story is; if you're going to port a game to PC for Steam, do it right. Other than that, this game was literally the best of it's time and went as far as being the best-selling game on the PlayStation 2. The story is AMAZING, the soundtrack fits the atmosphere of the game and the whole game is just awesome. But the Steam PC port? Not so much. I wish R* still released patches/fixes for the PC port but, of course, they are far too busy with ""other stuff"".Scores: PlayStation 2 version: 10/10Steam PC version: 8/10""So what are we supposed to do if the Ballas roll through?

												Unfortunately, as amazing a game as this is, I cannot in any good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.First, if you've come from having this game on the Playstation 2 (as many of us have) and want a digital version to play on your pc, don't. Just download an emulator and use the PS2 disc. The main reason I say this is that the most recent update has not only removed 16:9 resolutions from the game entirely (despite a previous patch fixing 1920x1080p resolution) but they have also removed many of the songs which made this game's soundtrack absolutely iconic.Songs removed from which stations:RADIO XOzzy Osbourne - HellraiserRage Against The Machine - Killing In The NameK-DSTJoe Cocker - Woman To WomanPLAYBACK FMUltramagnetic MCs - Critical BeatdownBOUNCE FMThe Gap Band - You Dropped a Bomb On MeFatback Band - Yum Yum (Gimme Some)Roy Ayers - Running AwayRADIO LOS SANTOSN.W.A. - Express Yourself2Pac - I Don't Give A F*ckK-JAH WESTBlood Sisters - Ring My BellBlack Harmony - Don't Let It Go To Your HeadMASTER SOUNDS 98.3Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band - Express YourselfThe Blackbyrds - Rock Creek ParkThe J.B.'s - GruntMaceo & The Macks - Soul Power '74James Brown - The PaybackSo as you can see, a lot of superb songs were removed, and the only good thing to come from this update? Xbox 360 controller support... which in consideration, isn't worth the tradeoffs. I'd rather stick with MKB and keep all my songs.The only actions I can recommend regarding this game is to go onto Amazon and buy a new copy of the game (£4.99 at the time of this post(£5 cheaper than this poor excuse for a game)) and while your 1080p res will still be broken, it will exist, and you'll have the full compliment of the original songs.The only downside to this? You have to have the disc in the disc drive to play it. I can live with that though, considering what's been done to the digital version.Or you could just pirate the game.			"

She has a huge favor to ask you. She needs to go away for a week and can't take Cream with her. Amy is busy this week. Would you babysit Cream? She gives you the keys to the house, and money for expenses. She promises both of you ""BIG"" rewards when she comes back. As of right now there is a newer version called V093.The object of the game is to seduce Cream the Rabbit into as many sex acts as possible. Your score is based on the number of times you manage each of the following:Showered with CreamSlept with CreamGroped CreamCream gives you a blow jobJerked off on CreamHad sex with CreamUsed the Carrot toy on CreamMade Cream ♥♥♥			"

												Hang on, hang on. Put your pitchforks away and hear me out for a sec.I love this game. This was the game that changed gaming back when people were mad that you played as someone not white. I played this game from hours to days on end and it is still one of the best games out there.Unfortunetly a recent patch destroyed it in multiple ways, the main reasons being...1. Due to Rockstar's legal papers expiring they removed all music from the game. Rock, Paper, Shotgun  goes into it a bit better than I can.2. This created an odd bug with some of the cars causing cars to... act up or bug out I guess.3. The update destroyed all save files. It wouldn't matter if your buying it but still.4. For whatever reason the resolution was messed up and now ""don't quote me on this one"" you can't play at 1080p and the game wasn't made to be played at a lower resolution making it look like sh*t.Overall I have to say, WTH. I mean this isn't going to remove the songs on Xbox or ps2. And the songs are still on all mobile copies of gta. So why only pc? *sigh* Rockstar. I'm somewhat scared if they are going down the same path as Ubisoft with the bad choices they're making and their 'Social Club' you need to sign up to play newer Rockstar games.In the end, your better off getting this game on mobile, witch is an odd thing to say for me because I hate mobile gaming but any smartphone can now play it, so might as well. Or hook up your dusty ps2 and go shoot hookers in flying cars over area 52.			"

												It has an interesting story with funny characters and though it's quite dated, still the best GTA ever. There's collectibles, stunt jumps, you can rob people at night, no drowning like in previous titles and pickups across the map ensure you can have fun without using cheats or being forced to save money. There is a multiplayer mod that I personally recommend, MTA (Multi Theft Auto) for it's network stability and simplicity as well as not requiring any overwrites so you can keep single and multiplayer separate! :D  I haven't even finished it yet, but I'm sure I'll have plenty to do after the story. (Map is a bit smaller than GTA5's, but still huge.)The best thing about older games: Anyone can run it easily. or almost anyone... You just need a PC from early 2000's or newer. 90's and older obviously can't. Sadly, GTA 3 and Vice City haven't aged so well. I always hated drowning too...I can't really think of any cons, so 9/10. I save 10's for the absolute best games with crazy high replay values. Battlefield 3 and Left 4 Dead 2 are good examples, but it's just my opinion.			"

												I loveddd this game to death, and it still remains one of my favorite games if not my favorite GTA. It's one of the first games I sunk over 100 hours into, and even more so with the many user mods released over the last decade or so, including two multiplayer ones and the CLEO mods. I figured I'd grab it on Steam a couple years back for convenience instead of continuing to use my scratched up disc copy. But a recent major patch for this game actually strips away content rather than add any. It has removed 1920x1080 support, 17 songs from the great soundtrack (most likely because of expired royalty/copyright), and replaces most of original menu/HUD with the mobile version similar to the recent Android/iOS releases of this game. You can find the full list of changes elsewhere.I only wrote this as a warning to any friends who may not be aware of this recent change and add a negative review to that column on the Steam store page. I'm fully aware how old/irrelevant this game may be at the time of this review.			"

												The original version of San Andreas was one of my favorite games to play long time ago. Now not anymore. Why? Rockstar screwed it up by replacing the original verison with iOS port,,, Seriously what... Why? So stupid.The port version is absolutely terrible. Lacking graphics options. Modding abilities are removed! Yes, removed... A lot of great music got taken out. It looks more cartoony than before. It does not feel San Andreas anymore. Extremely disappointing.At least I still have an original PS2 copy of San Andreas and thanks god for the AMAZING Grand Theft Auto V port... Now that GTA V version is the best version out there over all other console versions. Don't buy this game ever. Go buy GTA V instead. Original San Andreas version: 9 out of 10Now: 5 out of 10			"

												I was only nine years old. • I loved Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas so much, I had it for the original PS2. • I pray to Rockstar every night before bed, thanking them for the games I have been given. • ''Rockstar is love'' I say, ''Rockstar is life.'' • My dad hears me and calls me a console peasant. • I knew he was just jealous. • I called him a PC master faget. • He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. • I'm crying now and my face hurts. • I lay in bed and it's really cold. • A warmth is moving towards me. • I feel something touch me. • It's Gaben. • I am so happy. • He whispers in my ear, ''-70% Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.'' • He grabs my wallet with his powerful bribing hands and puts me on my hands and knees. • I'm ready. • I agreed with the Steam terms and conditions. • He pilfered my wallet hole. • It hurt so much, but I do it for -70% Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. • I can feel my wallet emptying as my eyes start to water. • I want to please Gaben. • He roars a mighty roar as he fills my inventory with his coupons. • My dad walks in. • Gaben looks him straight in the eyes and says, ''It was worth the weight.'' • Gaben rolls through my window. • Gaben is love, Gaben is life.

												I fondly remember playing this game behind closed doors and hiding it from my parents. The sprawling open world, taking over the city, all of the different cars to collect and store in the big four car garage in San Fiero (if you played the game, you know), everything! It was fun revisiting the game and remembering the wonder I felt when I first played it. One of the great games of the 00-09 decade.			"

												This game is in my opinion still one of the great games that has ever been created and I would love to see it getting a remake like TES V: Skyrim is supposed to receive in the near future. Gameplay-wise it sure has it's flaws like some weird physics (it's an old game so.. duh). But all in all I would recommend it to everyone searching for a good old sandbox shooter. Or people who wanna do some crazy stuff since this is probably the game with the most cheats (and the weirdest ones) I've seen to date. The only negatives I could see in this version are - Low Rider challanges seem to have reversed vertical controlls (Means: The arrow on the screen tells you to press ""up"" but you have to press ""down""The most annoying thing for me is not the game's fault, Because it's the censorship. As a German I have to deal with the probably most annoying censorship worldwide. I don't even care about heads not exploding when you shoot them with a sniper rifle or not being able to beat up corpses (Why do people actually wanna do that anyways?) What bugs me is that they removed the money drops when killing people. I see that they are trying to prevent people maybe thinking ""If I kill some stranger on the road I get rewarded!"" but damn.

The game crashes a lot, I find myself having to run all the way back to a save point after every mission from being scared of the game crashing.Some things just don't work - For some reason the cars just break all the time when you're not pressing the gas (not as in slow down, but actually break) Water plane (Skimmer) will barley move, probably to do with the random always breaking if no gas.

												Over the years Rockstar Games has continually downgraded the quality of the Steam version of this product. Because of this, I cannot recommend the Steam version of Grand theft auto: San Andreas upon download.Poor Business Decisions● Resolutions Above 1680x1050 Are Not Supported. Upon first downloading Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, resolutions above 1650x1050 are not supported. If you would like to go higher, you will need to download an older version of the gta-sa.exe.● No Steam achievements. Users of the Steam service have been lobbying for Steam achievements for San Andreas for years. Here we are, almost 10 years later (at the time of writing this review) and there's still no Steam achievements. The slap in the face is that Rockstar Games released an ""HD"" remake of San Andreas in 2014 for Xbox 360 with achievements.● 2014 ""Update"" Savegame Incompatibility Issue. On the 7th of November 2014 Rockstar released a ""patch"" that not only removed 19 songs for all users who legally purchased the game, they made all game saves created before that patch incompatible with that version, corrupting them along the way. This is quite serious as some individuals invest hundreds and in some cases thousands of hours into their save files only to have them get corrupted. Then again, you would think anyone that spends hundreds if not thousands of hours on their save would have backups, wouldn't you? This brings up the question if they're going to pull this stunt with Grand Theft Auto IV or Grand Theft Auto V a few years down the road.● Controversial Removal of 19 Songs Featured In The Original Release of The Game!On the 7th of November, 2014 Rockstar Games removed nineteen songs featured in the original version of the game, released on the 7th of June, 2005. The controversial business descision is that they didn't leave these tracks in the game for the users who have legally purchased this product before the 7th of November. So to this into perspective, Rockstar Games has essentially removed a great deal of content that users of the Steam service have legally paid for.Additional Information:When Grand theft auto: Vice City's music licenses were about to expire back in December of 2012, Rockstar Games removed the licensed songs from the game but allowed every user who purchased Grand theft auto: Vice City before December to keep their songs.List of Tracks Removed From The Steam Version:Bounce FMRunning Away - Roy AyersYou Dropped A Bomb On Me - The Gap BandYum Yum - The Fatback BandKDSTRunning Down A Dream - Tom PettyWoman to Woman - Joe CockerK-JAH West RadioDon’t Let It Go to Your Head - Black HarmonyRing My Bell - Blood SistersMaster Sounds 98.3Express Yourself - Charles WrightRock Creek Park - The BlackbyrdsFunky President - James BrownSoul Power ‘74 - Macer & The MacksThe Payback - James BrownGrunt - The JB’sPlayback FMCritical Beatdown - Ultramagnetic MC’sRadio Los SantosI Don’t Give A f*ck - 2 PacHood Took Me Under - Compton’s Most WantedExpress Yourself - NWARadio:XHellraiser - Ozzy OsbourneKilling in the Name - Rage Against the MachineI cannot recommend this product here on Steam and heavily recommend going elsewhere to obtain this product.

												The first law of gaming is that a video game must first and foremost have fun and this Grand Theft Auto San Andreas does ... and does it very well.The title is improved a lot compared to the previous episode, while presenting a linear plot, without much intrigue and twists; many sub-main missions (those wonderful stealth to recover some powerful weapons, or the music game-positioned to play in your car stereo stolen with a ball), so the various locations and different approaches to situations (you can, for to impress even get tattooed images on the body), make this unique title, despite being in effect a PC-game.The more than one hundred missions lead to use of the product for an average of about sixty hours of play, a time worthy of the best Final Fantasy.Our part venal takes over but we must admit that the sixty euro for GTA San Andreas are worth all, a title that will please those who waited for months now, who drooled over pictures and those who grew up in the 90s; after all graphics, sound and gameplay mixed for good are the true essence of the game is not it?

												While San Andreas in itself is a good game, I cannot recommend the Steam version of the game due to the update they released over a year or so ago now.Reasons being:- Game is alot more unstable, crashes more than GTA IV.- Mouse will randomly not work for no reason i.e. not being able to move the camera being a crucial thing in the game. Along with that I can't use weapons when the mouse doesn't work and the default keybinds in this version are horrendous.- Lack of 16 by 9 resolutions, though I seem to have 1280x720 and 1600x900 resolutions.- No intro video, not a game breaking thing but why remove it from the newer version I have no idea.- Some music removed from the game. This is unstandable due to licensing issues, again nothing game breaking, although it is for me as sometimes entering cars will make the game crashBefore the update the game ran perfectly fine, if you really want to get this game, try and pick up a retail copy second hand somewhere, that way, it is ""optional"" to have updates on the game. Thank Steam for removing the option to not update games. Did I forget to mention this is a mobile port?			"

You can't stop the update or even play the game until the update is complete.Seek out a physical copy, which could be easily found online for very cheap!It would of been nice for Rockstar to renew the licences for these songs, with all the success they have gotten from GTA 5.

Ha ha ha ha!""""I'll have a two number nines, a number nine large, a number six with extra dip, a number seven, two number forty-fives, one wit' cheese, and a large soda.""Set in the fictional state of San Andreas (most likely based on California) and features the fictional cities; Los Santos (based on Los Angeles), San Fierro (based on San Francisco) and Las Venturas (based on Las Vegas). The protagonist is Carl ""CJ"" Johnson who has returned back to his home after living in Liberty City (New York City) for 5 years to bury his mother.If you haven't already, I would recommend watching Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - The Introduction. Its a 20 minute video filmed in the San Andreas game engine.Have put numerous hours into the PS2, PS4 & Android versions of San Andreas.			"

												This game has a lot of weed smokin in it. That's what I was doing while playing this game when it came out for PS2. Well.... actually I wasn't smoking then. I was going through a bad OCD/anxiety period where I was worried I was gay. I'm not gay, but I was worried I was and that I really didn't like women. but I love the ♥♥♥♥♥, and am back to roasting bowls alll day. Im 32 years old now, this game came out when i was 23.			"

												Frankly, GTA: San Andreas is the game which got me interested in the franchise. Extremely well-written, expansive, innovative and incredibly fun. CJ is one of the strongest characters Rockstar has ever developed, along with the rest of the character list. The voice acting is incredibly well-done, the music selection is (or was) second only to GTA: Vice City in my opinion. The variety of things you can do in this game is arguably second-to-none in the entire franchise, which helps Rockstar in its portrayal of a truly open world.The graphical stylings, while outdated by today's standards, still please the eye and many parallels can be seen between this game's environment and that of Grand Theft Auto V's more recent version of Los Santos which I can't help but think about as I play this game. GTA V's environmental design would undoubtedly have suffered in my opinion had Rockstar not made GTA: SA previously.Overall, I'd consider it a must-play for anyone interested in sandbox games, GTA as a franchise or... hell, historically notable games. This game is widely considered one of the best of all time, which makes sense, considering it was the best-selling PlayStation 2 game ever.However, the Steam version has just been updated (after several years with no updates whatsoever), and there are a few unfortunate setbacks I have to point out for people who are considering buying the Steam version. Years ago, Rockstar updated GTA: SA for Steam with version 3.0. Among some bugfixes and miscellaneous improvements, the patch somehow inexplicably broke 16:9 resolution support entirely. This problem is still around in the latest patch, which, if you're like the majority of PC owners these days and have a 16:9 widescreen monitor, will mean you will encounter letterboxing and a lower resolution than your monitor is capable of rendering. Only with an unofficial modification can you get around this, and it's deeply disturbing that Rockstar still hasn't noticed this problem yet.Alongside this, Rockstar, apparently pressured by music publishers whose tracks they licensed for GTA: SA's soundtrack, has removed somewhere around 20 tracks from the game entirely. This was done retroactively, meaning that previous owners of the game before the latest patch, like myself, have no choice but to play the game now without musical content they purchased. If you don't play GTA games for the radio stations, this may not impact you as much, but regardless, Rockstar's approach to enforcing licensing restrictions with this patch was in my opinion heavy-handed at best, criminally deceptive at worst. It can set a precedent for AAA publishers to unilaterally remove content at will, and while the change of content with/without notice is disclosed in most games' EULAs these days, that just doesn't work in an economic system where one pays for the ownership of a good.Some of the artists in this game I first found out about thanks to GTA: San Andreas, including Helmet, Rage Against The Machine, NWA, Eazy-E, Ice Cube and Public Enemy, and it's a little heart-breaking that the game no longer reflects my childhood memories of it after a decade, with some of my favorite songs conspicuously absent. These are songs everyone who bought the game before the update paid for.Rockstar hasn't even mentioned the update at all on their website (par for the course, though, they're very sporadic with their PR), or on the News page on Steam for the game, so I'm not sure whether or not they were even going to announce this. We shall see what happens.I will be fair and include the latest patch's implementation of (apparent) DRM-free implementation and XInput control support, however. The XInput implimentation is not perfect but still playable and hopefully it is beneficial to people accustomed to GTA console controls. Basically, if you try using an Xbox 360 controller's triggers for throttle control for vehicles similarly to GTA IV you've got your work cut out for you, as all inputs besides the thumbsticks are treated as digital buttons including the triggers. This makes it very difficult to regulate the speed of your vehicle in my personal experience, which is extremely important in multiple missions. Other than performing steering with thumbsticks, I gained absolutely nothing in playablility because of this but was still capable of beating the game.It's due to these less-than-ideal changes to the game, as playable as it still is, that I cannot recommend you purchase the Steam version of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, because at the end of the day you get less content than you would have had a week ago for the same price (at the time of writing) and have no choice in the matter. You owe it to yourself to find an original retail version with the soundtrack and resolution compatibility completely intact, at least then you won't be forced to update the game according the whims of music industry executives.(As the update to the game was very recent and may change in the future, I will accordingly update this review if things develop further.)

												★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Still the best open-world game to date.You play as Carl Johnson, an ex-gangbanger that moved to Liberty City to live the good life. After years away from his old mates, he goes back to Los Santos to attent to his mother's, only to find himself back into the life he desperately wanted to get away from.Unlike Grand Theft Auto III and Vice City, the gameplay hasn't aged at all. Anyone who played IV or V will know what to expect, as it is the basis for every new GTA title. You can climb anything you want, look anywhere you want without the camera bothering you, interact with pedestrians, climb a mountain with a bike and much, much more. It's not about what you can do, it's about what you can't do. As this is the first 3D open-world game ever to have multiple cities, it leaves a lot to be expected. Fortunately, it does not disappoint. The cities (Los Santos, San Fierro and Las Venturas) are incredibly huge and detailed, fiddled with minigames, side-activities and crazy characters to spice up the formula. All accompanied by a large countryside for you to look for the Bigfoot explore.When you attach all that with an awesome licensed soundtrack that takes cues from dozens of different genres with the voice of Samuel L. Jackson himself, you realize that this is a game like no other. The world that Rockstar created using this engine feels like a living charicature of 90's USA, even if it's held back by the game's primitive visuals. It's just one of those rare videogames that everyone just needs to experience atleast once in their lifetime. I still find myself in awe from time-to-time with the outstanding atmosphere the state of San Andreas provides.			"

												Lets get this out of the way; the current, non altered state that the game is in is entirely unacceptable. Rockstar's decission with the latest ""patch"" is very much a slap in the face as well as running contrary to what they did when Vice City found itself in a similar situation (expiring music licenses). It is inexcusable and needs to be fixed.That being said, the game in it's present state is likely unplayable for a myriad of reason. The recent update is effectivly forcing you to use the same 'HD' version they was released for mobile devices, which gives you texture issues and problems with 1080p resolutions (not to mention broken controller and mouse support).To actually play this game, you are now forced to downgrade it to a previous version.The game itself, all current issue aside, is still a classic GTA game for a reason. And if you can get a non-Steam version or just simply downgrade this one, it is worth your time to play. However, I will not recommend buying this game until Rockstar either fixes the things they broke with the latest ""patch"" or issues an apology for how this was handled. If this is how they treat an older game, what's to stop them from doing the same with GTA IV or V?EDIT: I feel I should clarify, in case someone sees my playtime and calls it into question. I have owned this game on the PS2 for many, many years and have sunk many hours into that version. So yes, I am experienced with this game, but have only recently gotten it for the PC for various reasons (mostly my being lazy and it having been gifted to me by a friend who got it from preordering GTA:V).

												The game itself is very awesome and has much fans and players even nowdays, but the things are that that've made it worse in the latest patch.There ARE good side of it: it now supports new OS (windosw 7, 8(.1) are working good).But what's the cost! The main thing i've noticed is realy weird video mode. it now supports only few resolutions and all are not bigger then 1280x768. The next thing i've noticed is a crash from the main manu as you try to go into ""advanced"" video settings. this way I cant setup a normal resolution. Some folks also report such stuff like missing songs, textures and so on. The thing is that they've put a silly port from Xbox 360 into steam instead of the original PC version. This sux much.Upd: It is possible to tune a normal resolution with a third-party patch (""SilentPatch"")			"

												**A FAIR WARNING: THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO THE UPDATE TO THE GAME ON 11/07/2014**If there is any definitive proof that Rockstar Games hates PC gaming, this is it. Removing songs, fine, I can understand: the music industry has and will always be♥♥♥♥♥♥ Besides, I can always have Steam Player on full blast.But to remove resolution capabilities and destroy your save you've worked on for all these years all for ""XBox 360 controller support"" is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the highest caliber. And stealthily, too, I might add.Go back to the times GTA IV was released: you think you played that game like a champ on first try? No. You fixed .inis, you downloaded mods... and it took more than four years to kill that monstrosity they attached to it called GFWL.And now GTA V will be released on the PC on January, and with it another DRM that *ehem* was worked by the original monsters that started it all: SecuROM. You really want that jelly on your party?Who am I kidding? You'll buy the game. You've probably preordered. And you'll spend hundreds of hours laughing at what kind of a horrible human being Franklin is ingame. To that, I say: ""Enjoy your cancer.""To those who are sensible, though: BOYCOTT ROCKSTAR.			"

												Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas takes us to the city of San Andreas, which is loosely modeled after California. You play as Carl Johnson, former banger for Grove Street, who returns to Los Santos in San Andreas after several years.In San Andreas, the gang warfare system, is an interesting addition, allowing you to control territory and push out rival gangs. San Andreas has more of a focus on building the Grove Street gang into an empire, which was different from the way Vice City played. The soundtrack is pretty cool and there are newer features from previous GTA titles, such as muscular changes as you build stamina, or gaining weight from eating. San Andreas has a great storyline, memorable dialogue, and a kick♥♥♥♥♥jetpack you can steal and fly around on. Graphically it is better than Vice City, but not as smooth looking as GTA IV.  Though it is 10-years old, It is still fun to play and worth your time if you are a fan of the series. If you play or have played GTA V, you will undoubtedly recognize some landmarks from San Andreas.			"

Break the resolution all you want, that's fine. I don't run with the original Steam version of the gtasv.exe because I live in the second decade of the twenty first century and high resolution, 1080p gaming is what I'm used to, and there's a warez app for that.

												This game got me into Grand Theft Auto and into sandbox games in general. I loved this game so much I played it through, completely, unmodded, twice in a row (I never do that).I used to hang out with gang members so, living the life through CJ brought back memories of good times and bad times. I grew up with rap music eventually moving to rock and metal. I loved the soundtrack!Fortunately, GTA: SA is not rooted in reality and that's what made it so fun. Ever see gangbangers flying military jets and jet packs? Exactly!Another thing I loved about this game was that they took three big cities (based on three real-life big cities) and put them on one map and then put life all in between them.This was such a fantastic game and there's so much to say. But now.... (read the reviews below)I will say this, we all should have seen this coming.			"

												Rockstar's recent unannounced patch that they released to the PC version of the game has ruined the game for me.What are the damaging changes, you may ask?-Multiple songs have been removed from the game's soundtrack (Id assume this is caused by expired licenses, which is something i could understand)-Removed higher resolution options. I believe this was an issue back in the day, which got the game updated with higher resolution options, why on earth would they remove this later?-All save games prior to this patch are no longer usable. If you try to load a save prior to the patch, the game will start off new and fresh. And oh lookie, me who spent hours and hours trying to get 100% and finally did it, until a month later the save gets destroyedThe only GOOD thing this hidden patch gave was simple controller supportI would recommend anyone to refrain from buying this off steam, and grabbing an old CD instead, that doesnt get sudden patches 9 years after releaseEDIT:It seems that this version crashes or freezes more often during loadingI ended up losing 30 minutes of progress because the game had frozen, and this has happend 3 times now			"

												The Grand Theft Auto series is like comfort food. It's one I've always been able to go to for reliably charming characters, enthralling story and gameplay, with presented moments leaving me curious to dive in and see what's new and exciting.San Andreas is not an exception to this! In fact, in my books, it defines those exact values.As far as the story goes, the protagonist returns to his hometown, where he then finds his family and friends going downhill. Then framed by two high-ranking and corrupt policemen, he's on the run getting into all sorts of hijinks and shenanigans, traveling far and wide meeting and getting involved with all sorts of interesting characters!Simply navigating the variety of environments in the vehicles provided feels good. The weight of the cars is just right and though the friction their wheels provide against the ground could be called a little slidey and difficult to maintain, it's rewarding to feel yourself master the way it works as the game progresses, both through in-game stats and your own technical ability. The gunplay isn't anything too special, but every weapon does what it should and there's one or a few in every expected category (though some are definitely outside of what you'd expect) for getting the job done and more.There is absolutely no shortage of missions, and while some can be stubborn, every one is fun in premise. It's important to be careful, because any one mistake no matter the size can screw the whole gig over and cause you a lot of time! On missions where you're driving somebody important, which there are many of, flipping the car upside-down will cause it to catch on fire and, in time, explode. The person inside won't leave, and instead will sit there waiting for their demise, giving you a long time to think about how much they must hate you and an even longer time to think about how much you hate them. If you fail a mission, to try again you must make it all the way back in the world to the starting point... and this can lead to awkward and tedious situations, since some missions can take you pretty far away from where you began. Not to mention that if death is the cause of defeat, you'll lose all your guns and some of your cash you could use to help get them back! Any indoor segments can be clunky and frustrating, with the game's on-foot mechanics of navigation and battle noticeably designed overall to work better outdoors. It adds a good amount of pressure to not screw up when you know things can go wrong at any time, but it can be hard to keep sane when half your mistakes can be so easily blamed on the game!With missions put to the side, there's still much to play with outside of them. The world is full of things to do like play basketball, pool, or arcade games; you can go racing, disco dancing, gambling, or do some work as a paramedic... and that's just the start! The protagonist can change and be customized in many different ways: you can fatten him up with junk food, buff him up at the gym, get him tattooed at the tattoo shop, change his clothes to your liking, or take him to the barber for a trim! (Or an afro, seemingly straight out of nowhere?) While one of the few things you can't change about him is what he says and how he acts, throwing him in a pair of boxers with hearts on them as he goes about his business will seem to change his tone a bit. On a bit of the downside, there are a lot of collectibles, with no clues as to where they would be, all over the place in odd locations. This is an absolute pain to anybody who's picky about getting everything done, but resources can be found online which list the location of every one, and if it's not something important to you then know that you're not missing out on much! All rewards are something nice to have, but are pretty much all superfluous, as you can already obtain just about everything they offer otherwise. (There are a few exclusives, but still, they're nothing fun or exciting, only helpful, so don't worry!)For the age of the game, the graphics stand up well to the test of time. Not in their realism, but in the style they are consistently represented in. Everything is solid from one thing to another, and the world is beautiful to look at from every angle, though it shines especially when everything can be seen complimenting one another at once from a distance! Indoors the attention to detail can be lacking, especially in some of the mission-exclusive locations, but you'll be finding yourself outside most of the time anyhow, and it's nothing that will break the experience when you aren't.The soundtrack consists of licensed tracks, and is represented through the different radio stations you'll hear while driving, which offer from one to another a good selection of just about anything anybody could be into. It sticks true to the early nineties setting, the list of tracks being full of nothing but memorable songs! Each radio station has commercials brimming with heavy satire, alongside an eccentric disc jockey who chimes in every now and again. There's no shortage of both hit classics and hidden gems which anybody should be happy to hear again or to be introduced to. It's all top-notch, and compliments the time you'll spend in cares quite well! Even if you don't like what's presented, since this is the PC version of the game you can add your own tracks into the game if you'd like, which will have their own radio station.For anybody new to the series, I'd suggest this being the place to start. To get through the story alone takes fifty to sixty hours, but if that seems like a bit much, don't worry! It'll be hard to notice the time flying by when there's so much fun to be had. With a wide variety of weapons, vehicles, side-games, and a gigantic world to play with all you find and gain within, the game lives up well to the title of the series, which even outside of context gets to the point: it's grand, there's theft, and loads of auto! ...Auto meaning, y'know, automobiles...

												Simply one of the best games ever made. If you haven't played it, you haven't lived. If you have played it, you know exactly what I'm about to say and you shouldn't even be reading this, you should be out there playing this game.Openworld, missions, a good storyline, silliness, seriousness, activities, weapons, driving, there's SO much you can do in this game. Want some excitement? Go for a good race (with or without cops chasing you),. Want some sightseeing instead? Drive through the countryside or the cities. Not too excited for all the freeroam? Doesn't matter, play the story instead, which is amazing and pretty long too. You'll never get bored in this game, and if you do, you can always install SA:MP or MTA and play this game multi with some friends and try some fun little gamemodes :)			"

												In my top 3 games of all time, but the recent patch kind of killed it for me. The visuals downgraded and for some reason, my gun smoke isn't grayish/white like it usually was, it is now green like the spraypaint mist while use the spraypaint. The Soundtrack was altered and tracks were removed but those songs technically could just be added back into the game with the custom radio station, but still, Rockstar, GO EAT A SAC OF BABYDIKS.Buy a hardcopy or torrent it (at your own risk), because I give this game a 10/10, best GTA i've ever played, and that probably will never change.OH YEAH, ROCKSTAR ALSO RELEASED THE REMASTERED VERSION WITH MUCH BETTER GRAPHICS ON THE XBOX360..GRAPHICS THAT ARE BETTER THAN THE ONES BEFORE AND AFTER THE UPDATE.

If you warned me that this patch would remove 17 music tracks, 1080p video mode and save data, I would not have accepted.If anyone from rockstar or steam are actually reading these comments, I can assure you that I'm going to contact trading standards and citizens advice ASAP to see if this is even legal in UK law.

PROS:+ amazing & awesome story+ cool soundtrack+ really great gameplay & combat+ TONS of side missions+ character customization+ vehicle customization+ you can finally swim+ no Rockstar Games Social ClubCONS:- compatibility issues with newer OS- lots of glitches - audio, graphic- mouse control issues- game freezing in menusComment:No I have not made a mistake, I DO believe this game is fantastic, but I DO NOT recommend this game on Steam. The game itself is amazing although with a few issues. The most apparent issues are with compatibility, mostly on Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10. Problems ranging from audio and graphic glitches ... screen/game freezing .. to mouse controls not working properly. Same as in Vice City. But you could expect these for an old game and many (if not all) can be fixed by adding fixes, workarounds and mods. Now I remember how my friend bought me this game over a decade ago. The huge amount of content ... cool story ... I had lots and lots of fun. To this day I still own the DVD and I even got my girlfriend to play it. And she loved it too. So I thought I would have digital copy just in case something happens with my DVD. An added bonus is also that you do not have to deal with RGSC in this game. But just like Vice City it suffers from licensing and how Rockstar treats digital distribution of games. Because you DO NOT OWN IT when you buy it here, you just borrow it. They change the game when they wish and as recent events have shown they can remove stuff. Songs, options, fixes and in this way also all of the mods made throughout the years. In this case they swapped it with a mobile port entirely. And this will go on in the future. So as time goes your copy of the game on Steam gets worse and worse ... while old disk copies (like mine) and even pirated versions remain the best quality available. THIS is why I do not recommend buying it here. Which is a shame because it is one of the best games I have ever played and mods just made it even better. Most of those mods got invalidated when they switched the normal version with this clumsy port. Yes, you can download files to return it back to how it was. But then what is the point of having a legal digital copy if you need third-party files. Very very disappointing. Also this review and a TON of others were pushed away to erase the ""Mostly Negative"" score on Steam, real classy Rockstar & Valve...			"

												Real life isn't real, GTA:SA is real life!  This game will improve your real life gangsta skills!  I purchased GTA:SA and listed it on my application for my local street gang and voila! I became a low-level gang member risking years of imprisonment for less than minimum-wage!  Life is so great now!The 'fo rizzle' review:  It's a good game.  Graphics are obviously dated, but honestly not that bad considering when this was made.  Install some of the graphics enhancement mods and it's even better.  There is no first-person, only third (driving has a bumper view).  Controls can be a little 'wonky' at times, but again, that's to be expected for an old game and it does not take anything away from the overall experience.(Some people experience a bug where the character moves forward constantly.  A few found the problem to be a virtual controller in the Device Manager to be the cause - disabling should solve that.  Look to the forums for a detailed solution.  All I had to do was unplug my joystick and steering-wheel.  Either way, easy fix.)Basically you're a gangster who does gangster things:  kill, rob, drive-bys, etc.  You run with the Grove-Street gang while gaining ""respect"" and moving up the ranks.  At some point, you'll be able to control territories and expand your gang's influence while defending the turf you have.  There is a decent story line which I won't go into, along with multiple girlfriends you can date if you choose to.  Rival gangs chase and shoot at you; police chase you after committing crimes; paint your car to lose your wanted status or simply hide out and wait for it to go away.  If you've played other GTA titles, then it's all very familiar.I played this as a kid and it brought back good memories.  There are a couple of software 'updates/mods' you'll want to install to make the game run better.  To play higher resolutions (ex. 1980x1280, etc.), you'll definitely need these updates/mods - simple to install.  They can be found on others' reviews.Purchased during the July 4th sale (around $3.00) and well worth it!  Rated 8/10 stars.			"

												Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.. come on, do I even need to review this? This game takes you on a journey of a young adult by the name of Carl Johnson who receives news of his mother's passing and as a result he goes on to find the person who did this.Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, for its time, is a phenominal game. While I did play this during my younger years, I don't think I'm looking at it with nostalgic goggles. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is packed full of content, features and things to do. Many of which are not even found in newer titles such as Grand Theft Auto V. The world is rich in life, variety and constrast between areas. Again, who would've imagined such a gaming world back in 2004? I certainly didn't, and I was peeing myself seeing Half-life 2.I don't know what more to say, this game is what it is.. that's why I questioned myself why did I need to review it, it's simply amazing. Everyone needs to try this game.			"

												Absolutely great game......before the recent patch that removed songs, broke saved games, made mods incompatible, limits available resolutions and so on. I would be even willing to let removing of the songs slide since its the music industry that screws everybody there, but why mess around where it is not needed? This is a mobile version now, so you might as well buy it on iOS or Android if thats enough for you.For the PC I recommend getting it *cough* elsewhere *cough* with all the original songs and moddability intact. You can use SAAC and / or Pinnacle game profiler to map gamepads to work better with the game than you can with this newly released abomination.Thanks Rockstar!By the way, my playtime on Steam copy is so low because I've used downgraded exe for mods. My real playtime since latest install is about 80 hours. I also have owned this game on the original Xbox and have bought it on iOS just to support Rockstar.			"

												This game was a very good game up till now.Instead of a great PC game made for it now he have lost close to 20 songs, 1080p resolution and we've got port of a mobile port of this excuse of a game.Rockstar is going down, also pulling their games down with them. I used to think that rockstar is a good developer, i've bought most of their games including gta v on ps3 but what they pulled now makes all the previous actions not important.Important thing is we've had a good PC game, now they switched it for a stinky smelly piece of crap. Congratulations Rockstar, good luck selling a version of a game worse than pirated copy downloaded from the p2p (torrent). Not many studios can destroy already good game like you do!Better look for a box copy of the game to experience the only true feeling of San Andreas PC(i recommend this version). Digital downloads can easly change the game and rip us off.			"

												After the Update, this game is not worth buying now. it's unacceptable to even think about doing something like this. Removing classic songs from the game? I can maybe understand a little due to copyright but still, the music was what made my long driving in Gta: San Andreas worthwhile, and they took out 18 songs (18!!!). They also deleted all my saved files (which included one where i was more than halfway through the game, it took forever) now i have to start all over with 18 songs cut out. The only thing worthwile from this patch is that now it supports Xbox 360 controllers, thats it. other than that its abyssmal. Now i have to replay all of GTA: San Andreas on a dumbed down version. Great.			"

												The new game steals music from users who legally purchased the game while the license was still active. This is not okay nor is it legal. There is no law that forces or even allows any company to retroactively steal music from customers who legally purchased it while the copyright license was still active.Putting up a new copy of the game online so that new customers don't get the expired songs music is how this should have been handled, but they had no right to remove the songs from copies that were legally purchased by the end user while the license was still active. I can't believe they would be this stupid and lazy.It's no different than if they illegally hacked your X-box to remove access to the songs from the hard copy of the game or if a music company hacked your computer to erase some MP3 files that you bought and downloaded because the publisher lost the license for some of the songs on it.This was illegal for Rockstar to do, there is no licensing law that forced or even permitted them to do this. This move was entirely on them and I expect they will have a class action lawsuit on them for it in the near future.Regardless of what they would like to believe, no ELUA makes it legal for them to do this. The enforcability of many ELUA elements is already questionable, but this is actual theft and the ELUA agreement will not protect them in this case.			"

												This game was great, the last update ruined it in a lot of ways, the frame limiter turned off causes game breaking bugs, and with the limiter on the game looks horrible. They removed songs from a game i already bought, which seems very wrong to me. The last update supposedly gave us a different version from a mobile port or something, i dont really care. I had a great review for this game before the update trashed it. Whether it is Rockstar or Valve or Steam who is to blame i dont know, but this issue has brought up the scary idea of publishers going back and removing liscensed content from games in your library. beyond that fear, the console versions of gta san andreas got full HD versions, PC did not, it will not play in true 1080 and is overall much worse. I fear the success of console games has made developers stop valueing their pc customers.Terrible treatment of fans and customers.			"

You are making a very good case AGAINST buying games digitally.I hope this move bites you bigtime.			"

												Rockstar recently updated the game; well, I shouldn't say ""updated"", I should say ""replaced"". They replaced the game with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mobile port that the 360 got. This new port has a reduced song count, worse performance than the original port it replaced, and the resolution options have been crippled. On the bright side of things, you can now OFFICIALLY use your 360 gamepad, instead of spending two minutes setting up an easy-to-use and free third party program that offers literally more benefits than GTA:SA native gamepad support. If you do end up buying this, make sure you get the unofficial patch to revert the game back to its 1.0 version, which also supports mods.			"

												Personally my favorite GTA, with one of the most diverse game worlds ever created. I could write a giant essay on this one game and how awesome it is. Only problem is that this is the Steam version we're talking about, which removed a lot of songs that helped give this one the personality that it achieved more then 10 years ago. Don't buy this version unless you're willing to snoop around the forums or the web to find a downgrader, patch, etc.			"

												Grand Theft Auto: San AndreasStory - One of the best campaigns I've ever played. Not going to say anything at all because it will spoil it. Just play it! Story is just. Amazing. 10/10Storyline Length - Around 10 hours. A day or so.AI - Fun to play with, not too hard to kill, not to easy to fight against. It's great. 10/10Experience - At times, you'll laugh way too hard, you'll call Big Smoke a fat ♥♥♥♥, you'll look for Bigfoot because of those fake myth videos, you'll cry at the end. Simply amazing. *The one thing I hate (it's my PC's fault, not taking away points) is that the car brakes by itself. And I don't like turning frame limiter on. 10/10Graphics - Erm. It's a game from 2004 or something, so I really can't complain. All I'm gonna say is that it looks good enough. I love how cars have a lot of detail in them. And the Mod shop for the cars! That's one of the reasons I still play the game! Graphics are cool. 10/10Sounds / Voice Acting - Perfect voice acting. Catalina's phone calls mid-game that mock you, car sounds, gun sounds, helicopter sounds, plane sounds, the radio! You even get to have your own radio with your own music. Love it. 10/10Controls - Takes a while to get used to, especially the lowrider ""jumping"" controls. Apparently it was the numpad, and not the arrow keys. 9/10Overall - 10/10""What? No ""All you had to do was follow the damn train, CJ!"" comments?""No, honestly, I found that mission easy and did it in one go. I don't really see the difficulty in it.""I'll have two number 9's, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, number 7, two number 45's, one with cheese, and a large soda.""Wanna guess who said that?When you finish the story, play this song and drive around San Andreas

Grand Theft Auto: San AndreasOpen-World Action-/Racing-Game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games on the 26th October 2004 for Sony Playstation 2,and on the 7th June 2005 for Microsoft Windows and XBOX.Story:The Story is set in the State of San Andreas,which is based on Areas of California and Nevada,with the three major cities Los Santos(Los Angeles),San Fierro(San Francisco) and Las Venturas(Las Vegas).The Main Character,the African-American Carl 'CJ' Johnson,returns to his old hometown Los Santos after five years of living in the fictional city Liberty City(A city that also appears in several other parts of Grand Theft Auto,such as GTA 3,GTA Vice City,where it only gets mentioned by the main character Tommy Vercetti, and GTA 4). After an Introduction Sequence CJ gets to meet several old contacts such as his older brother Sean ""Sweet"" Johnson,his sister Kendl Johnson,and his old gang mates Ryder and Big Smoke. Several plot twists bring CJ to the cities San Fierro and Las Venturas,where he does Missions for several old and new contacts.Gameplay:The player starts with getting dropped off in a district of Los Santos.In the beginning the Player has to do a few Missions first to unlock all the World's content such as clothing shops,hairdresser's,tattoo and gun stores,restaurants and tuning garages. After unlocking the whole content the player is able to find the mentioned features all around the map.With playing the Story missions,the player starts to unlock more of the map,such as the countryside around the cities as well as the cities San Fierro and Las Venturas themselve.The player can travel through the world of San Andreas by using cars,bikes,motorbikes,boats and later even helicopters and planes.For fighting,the game offers a big amount of guns and other weapons that can be found all over the map or bought at one of the several gun stores.The game also includes several minigames such as races,lowrider competitions and dance contests.Atmosphere:The Game's World attracts the player with a realistic,plausible setting and map.Eleven Radio Stations can be heard while riding a vehicle,also players can do their own radio by dragging mp3-files into the user files.Conclusion,Pro's and Con's:Pro:- Funny and addicting gameplay- Huge,beautiful and interesting map- Cool characters- Interesting story about betrayal, family and the Drug War between Gangs- Huge amount of weaponsContra:- Sometimes weird and unplausible moments in story- Car and motorbike stearing got much worse than in the prequels- Irritating MinigamesConclusion:Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a funny,addicting Game which has a huge amount of content and is absolutely worth buying. Although it sometimes has it weak moments,most of the time it is awesome to play!Rating: 90/100Important!The stearing of cars,motorbikes,etc. gets better the longer you drive em'(driving skills improve with time spent riding the different types of vehicles),but without cheats it takes a while to get 'pro' on driving a car!

												A great crime game, worth every penny.Depsite having outdated graphics and an options menu with an anti-aliasing option that you can't activate this game is great fun. I picked it up cheap in the summer sale and I'm glad I did as it's so much fun. I used to think GTA IV was amazing but playing this has made me realise that GTA IV is only a GTA game by a thread. This is the proper crime simulation while GTA IV is more of a casual game this is more realistic (not physics wise but simulation wise).If you can't run or afford GTA V, I would recommend this. I hear they're very similar, and this will satisfy your GTA needs (hopefully). Also don't forget to try out the multiplayer mod that was made for this game, it's great fun!Good game, worth a purchase!9/10P.S. Notice my low playtime. In reality I have been playing SAMP (San Andreas Multiplayer) for a LOT more time than what is displayed here. Sadly Steam doesn't track Non-Steam games and executables (Maybe one day...).			"

Because this game is so damn good it deserves two playthroughs, hell it probably deserves five. It's definitely the long cherished gem of the GTA series for a reason, whilst the much heralded GTA IV might beat it on gameplay depth, GTA: San Andreas sure as hell beats it on everything else.			"

												I have held back on writing a review about this but I shall be silent no more!Note that this is a review or the CURRENT steam version of the game .All right R* you effed up , and you effed up hard. Here I was , thinking that the whole idea of patches was to make a game better. Instead what do we get? Lower resolutions , black screen freezes and dubious controller support. Wow , thanks I guess, I'll just mod it for 1080p and to use analog triggers for gas/brake on my 360 controller. What is that R*? I cant? Your brilliant state of the art update made all the mods incompatible? Well at least I still have the great soundtrack. What? I dont have that either? You have removed some of the best songs because you were too stingy to pay royalties? IRONY ALERT:CJ actually sings fragments of some of the removed songs when left idle  (""You dropped a bomb on me"" for instance )R* advertise the PC version of GTA 5 having 160 songs more than the console version and at the same time they remove songs from the other game set in the same city.Personal note:I bought this game in hopes of reliving my adolescent years but I guess that was too much to ask for.  I have been now stuck on Fender Ketchup  , the scare-o-meter fills up but nothing happens. That is if the mission starts at all , most of the time the game just freezes when walking into the mission blip or the casino.TL;DR: Not modable, less songs , glitches and freezes.  Dont buy this crap , in this state this is like a beta version of the game we used to know and love. We are paying the same amount of money for less content , which hardly seems fair.			"

You start the game performing an ancient ritual of African American culture: performing the theft of the two-wheeled strength-dependent vehicle (Stealing a bike), and as the game progresses, you will be able to perform other activities that are common with colored folk such as eating fried chicken, playing basketball, and engaging in gang warfare.5 ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS FOLLOW THE DAMN TRAIN, CJ's out of 5			"

												""One of the greatest games ever made.""That's what I said about Vice City and that's also what I think about San Andreas.The game is set in the nineties in a fictional state called San Andreas. You play the role of Carl Johnson (CJ), who has been living in Liberty City. But then he got a phone call. His mom was killed by a drive-by. He rushes home to Los Santos to do honour to his mother. Back at home he has to put in work for his hood. A cycle of violence begins: drugs, gang wars, corrupt police... Welcome to Los Santos!What GTA San Andreas delivers is classical GTA gameplay with many improvments:- the huge world with 3 different cities, smaller towns and varying environments like desert, farmland, forests, hills- an amazing shooting and movment system compared to Vice City   You can duck, swim, dive, climb on rooftops etc. Which gives you a new feeling of freedom- there is even a bigger variety of vehicles: bikes, bicycles, sport cars, SUVs, pick-ups, boats, helicopters and planes!- customisation: tattoos, clothes, hairstyle, tuning cars- RPG elements: you have to eat, you can level up skills - many details and mini-games: robbery, basketball, video games, billard etc.- amazing music: especially rap music (nwa, 2pac, ice cube, eazy-e), but probably not as good as Vice City's musicThe story of GTA SA is okay, but sometimes confusing and hard to follow. I also think that parts of it are a bit over the top. However Rockstar Games did a good job connecting the story of Vice City, San Andreas and GTA 3. They also did a good job with the characters.Some of the missions are a bit annoying, but overall the missions are very good. I really like the addition of stealth in some of the missions.Rockstar added a lot of details and mini-games, which often made me wonder: ""Wtf? You can really break into a house and steal TVs? This game is amazing!"" I love such moments.What I also really liked was the hood part of the game. Getting green shirt, rag and shoes, spray a car in green, call your homies to join you, drive through other gang areas, provoke a gang war... even if the KI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and could have been improved. Of course it's a matter of taste and actually not the whole game is about the hood life.Conclusion: GTA San Andreas offers so much content, that everyone will get countless hours of fun out of it. If you haven't played it yet, go get it now or you'll miss a part of video game history!			"

												NOTE: I'm reviewing this game while using a (legal) downgrader to 1.0. This changes from the steam version (which sucks) to the good, old one. The first version, that was on hardcopies, etc. The game as it is (without a downgrader) is a ruined game which deleted 18 of great songs and many other content YOU PAID FOR. If it wasn't for the downgrader i'd not recommend it. Now, to the review.Old, but gold. Simply the best.You all know of this game, if not, you were born too early. It's one of the BEST open world games EVER. The story is great, map is huge, there is MYTHS and LEGENDS and EASTER EGGS everywhere. The mod community is the BIGGEST in the world. Songs are GREAT. The whole soundtrack is perfect. There is an unofficial multiplayer mod ""San Andreas: Multi Player"" which is better than GTA Online. I just wanna confirm this game is great. If you didn't hear of it before (which would mean you're kinda left out a bit) just try it. 10/10.			"

 ""All we had to do, was follow the damn train, CJ!"" ~ Melvin ""Big Smoke"" Harris Back when I was a little snort other kids were afraid of me because I've been setting dogs on fire. I had only one friend. That friend introduced me to the world of GTA. My first GTA was Vice City. That game was a true experience. It made me feel all tingly in the places I now pay women to lick and suck. Results, unfortunately, cannot be compared to the pleasure Vice City gave me. And then my only friend said:  ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ negro, wait till you play San Andreas.""   MY♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥GOD  That game wasn't like anything I played before. It was bigger, faster, better. It had everything my developing body and mind needed. Rockstar had always been great with writing plot and making cutscenes but they outdone themselves in San Andreas. It had it all. Gang wars, bouncing lowriders, classic rock, sunset over the desert, robbing the casino, murdering harlots to get your cash back, etc, etc.I mean, you started as a low gangbanger from the ghetto with no rep, no name and then BAM you're stealing a fighter jet from an air carrier just to blow Russian spies to kingdom come. Is there anything better? Of course not, you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.I've been playing it with my mouth open and my underwear leaking with j1zz. From blastin dem balla fools through exile from Los Santos, passing  THOSE MOTHERFUKING DRIVING AND FLYING SCHOOLS,  stealing a jetpack, all the way to blastin balla fools again that game was just... just... it was... DAYUM SON IT WAS THE♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ NIQQA, IT WAS THE♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I played that game not long ago and I know whatchu sayin,  ""Ah but shiee, dawg, dat game is hella old and it looks terrible and check muh CS:GO skins, shieee.""  If you do that and please follow Robin Williams' example and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥KILL YOURSELF. This game has flaws, yes, but it is, even today, one of the greatest achievements of game industry.Such names as CJ, Sweet, Cesar, Kendl, The Truth, Toreno,  motherfukin Tenpenny  are part of my life. They will stay with me forever. That game shaped me. Made me a better man.Final Rating: ★★★★★ That's right, beyotch. 5 motherfukin stars. That game means more to me than my mother.			"

												I loved this game when i played it on the ps2 and i was looking foward to playing on pc to get my childhood memories back but after playing not even an hour i cant recommend this game.Rockstar Updated the game for no reasons... have you ever heard the term leave well enough alone? well we all know rockstar did not hear that because with the update nearly a decade later. The updated removed songs form the radio station people report about broken save files and they even removed resolutions... i play on a 1366x768 and they dont even have that resolution... i think they have four or five resoltions you can choose from and if you have a higher resolutions that what gta sa gives you then to bad you have to play on one of the lower resolutions.Also my game freezed up by trying to enter the pizza shop close to grove street! What i never had a game freeze up on me and i have played arma 2 and 3 farcry 4 assassins creed 4 and many more and i can play them just fine but i cant play a 10 year old game without it freezing? Also people have reported that you cant mod gta sa no more... why the **** not rockstar, you took away SA MP why would you do that to us. One of the most popular if not the most popular gaming company gave us the worst update they could have ever done. you should put gta sa on the steam workshop that would be amazing but you wont will you rockstar... no you wont, you took away many of our childhood memories with that update, you need to reupdate the game taking away all the stuff you put in this update.I have also noticed that the textures in the game are messed up as well, at the begining of the game when officer tenpenny and the other 2 officers gun down carl i noticed there guns clipping through the hands and it was very noticable so yes it is true that there is glitches with the textures in the game.Another issue is that when i start up the game i cant use the mouse i have to CTRL+ALT+DEL many times to get my mouse to move the camera which makes no sense... and yes you can use a controller but you dont know what to do because it say stuff like use joy 9 to do this or joy 11 to do this... why not just say use y to enter and car and use x to jump... so unless you know all the 16 buttons and where they are at on the controller you wont be able to play with a controller. and yes i know you might be thinking that well if you have played gta sa before you should be able to play with a controller right... wrong because when i tried to use the controller everything was swapped around on the controller making it impossible to figure out what was what and where was where.So i wish i could recommend this game but no i cant i feel it would be a sin to recommend this game that was one a amazing game to now a run down game full of missing songs to broken save files to texture glitches... and its sad knowing one of the very best gta games has been ruined by there own creator's... i never thought the day would come.

												Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas boasts an exceptional soundtrack, a well-written story line and a slew of plot twists and other surprises. The dialogue between CJ and his crew is raw but convincing, and some big-name celebrities contribute their vocal talent, including James Woods and George Clinton.Without question, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas isn't for kids because of its graphic violence, sex, and coarse language, but mature fans of this 32 million-unit-selling franchise who want to know if this sequel lives up to its hype, the answer is a resounding yes. Few video games pull off everything successfully, but San Andreas does so in spades. Indeed, this mature-rated game may be deemed offensive for its depiction of life as a ""gangbanger,"" but if taken for what it is -- an interactive action-adventure for adult gamers -- you won't find a title that's more difficult to put down.

												I always played this game on PS2 but I love the PC controls a lot more. Look, do not play this game on PS2 anymore because the graphics and lighting compared to this pc port are so damn washed out, I just can't believe it. This game is a classic and if you want a good written story with good voice acting than, you would like this as well. The only bad side to this game is the default controls. They are just terrible and hard to get used to. Totally change the controls as fast as you can. It's kind of disappointing that most people won't go out and get a 10 year old and just buy the newest GTA, but you don't know what you're missing out on. Graphics might be really dated but the story will never be. If you're a retro kind of guy like me, then you should reconsider your next buy.			"

You can swim, you can fly, you can shoot with 2 weapons, the map it's as big as Liberty City and Vice City together and you can create the apocalipsis with the cheat codes.The storyline was big... but I think San Fierro was the most forgetable part of it.

												Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is what I consider the best of the series. I am constantly surprised Rockstar managed to put this game on the PS2. It features a massive open world, with a simply sublime soundtrack and cast of characters. The gameplay was far more dynamic then it's predecessor. With being able to climb walls, to having a parachute, to finding a jetpack and doing drive by shootings from 50 feet in the air.San Andreas was just as amazing when it first came out as it is today. Almost every modern sandbox game takes leaps and bounds that Rockstar first carved in 2004. If you only buy one Grand Theft Auto game, buy this one. You will definately not regret, nor forget, San Andreas.			"

												I really enjoyed playing this game. Before i played only Vice City and decided now to finish San Andreas before i start GTA 4 and 5. Even it's so old it was real fun to play it. For me GTA San Andreas has everything what game needs to deliver real joy to a gamer. Thanks to developers for really cool 4 days of gaming. I would play more and more if there would not be GTA 5. But first i will finish the 4th part :D			"

Sure, R* totally ruined Steam version with its license-bullsh♥t patches, but GTA modding community is one of strongest and didn't give up and let GTA:SA hurt too much.

There isn't that much to say, engaging story, great gameplay, politically incorrect american humor, and lots, lots of violence. With a result of lots and lots of fun. GTA San Andreas ladies and gentlemen, a milestone. We don't need to say anything else (Sorry for my bad english)Italiano:Non hai veramente giocato a GTA finché non hai giocato a San Andreas. E' uno dei titoli migliori della serie, se non IL migliore sotto certi aspetti.

												GTA: San Andreas.. A game that opened up a lot of enjoyable and memorable moments. I remember being by the coast and a blonde woman in roller skates flying past me saying ""I'm so thick that I can♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;, I cried away at this for quite a while and never forgot it. This game exposed what was supposed to be the life of a drug dealer and the struggles that came for Carl Johnson. Playing this on the PS2 was great simply because I would have one of my friends play with me, the coop was a great idea which I loved after playing this alone which would get pretty boring. The missions were very fun and exciting; moments of rage were present very frequently when I failed.			"

												All this time, years and years after being released onto this world, San Andreas has remained one of the best GTA games ever to be made. Compared to the present ones, yeah, it lacks graphics, that's the only flaw it really has.   So, you are a black man - Not being racist here - And your life is just... awful, care to make it better? This game is all about it, making someone's life better. You start has a lowlife gangbanging balla killing machine.. and at the end? The exact same thing, but rich, the whole city is at your feet.  In my opinion, this game makes me feel great, riding bikes on the desert at extremely high speeds, jumping off a plane without a parachute, hearing Cj's remarkable comments everytime.. pure comedy. Besides, having a mature and dark story, if you are willing to hear it, the surreal experience makes you feel part of it.   This game is old, hell yeah it is, but so is your mom.. and you still love her don't you? That's what i fell, it has everything GTA V has, except great graphics and online gameplay. You can steal houses here, buy ridiculously expensive massions, make great cars (Racing Ones), participate in lowrider events, races... or even, just parking your car somewhere, doesn't matter where really, and listen to the music this game has.. (+ adding your own to the game) At the end of the day, to me, this game beats GTA V - 100/0- No doubts. Wanna know why? Groove is Life ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"

												Well Rockstar, you've just ruined one of my most favourite games, a childhood game. Well done you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ To add huge insult to the injury, you're not even responding to the gargantuan complaints of your consumers. Yes, I know the notion of modding content back in has been put forward, and thanks to all who have suggested that but the point is that this shouldn't even be happening in the first place. True, it will cost a lot to get back the licenses and restore the old version, but ask yourselves R*, what is your community (the people who buy your games) worth to you?			"

												Phenomenal open-world sandbox. Great gameplay with a variety of missions and things to do, an excellent story that knows when to be serious and when to be funny, and a phenomenal radio setlist that really captures the feel of the early '90s. However, you're better off pirating it or playing it on a PS2 emulator because of the patch Rockstar put in that removed a bunch of songs from the in-game radio (they took out Killing in the Name and Hellraiser, would not buy), removed resolution options, and broke everybody's saves. Or you could just buy it on steam and download the unofficial patch that fixes the the game and the stuff Rockstar removed, but that would mean giving them money.			"

												Even if the Grand Theft Auto series has always been good, this was one of the best games in the series. In many people's opinion it was better than GTA IV. Although it wasn't perfect, the sheer size of San Andreas was something that could not be denied. It had country sides and even the city of Los Santos. This was R* (Rockstar's) best game until GTA V. Even thought GTA: SA is old I still enjoy playing it and it's still  great game. The story is great and the open-world is fun too. I highly recommend it.(it's better than minecraft)			"

												I am playing the GTA serie one after the other.Finished GTA III and Vice City. (see my reviews)What's different / new compared to Vice City (VC)Same like VC1) Overview map : Can be accessed via the game menu, in addition to VC you can add a marker.Still the lack of a hotkey 'M' for direct map access.....because it is a console port.2) Cash income : slow so you are 'forced' to do side missions. Later in the game, you haveaccess to race missions and can export cars at the harbor which are really helpfull in cash generation.3) Buying properties and as such having a save point or an asset (cash generation)4) Weaponry : +/- same, in addition knife or silenced pistol for stealth.5) Music score : Same quality which means superb, choice for everyone....rock, hip-hop, rap, alternative, country.6) pop-ups of cars and buildings even at high drawing distance settings7) frame limiter needs to be set 'on' just like VC and GTAIII to avoid strange physics of cars.Better then VC1) Windows 10 : Unlike VC and GTA III, i didn't need to apply the Silent patch to run the game smoothly.2) Map size : hughhhh, three cities connected with green land, mountains and local villages.Each city has it's own typical lay-out with references to Las Vegas - San Francisco - Los Angeles3) New vehicles : bike, truck, train, tractor, harvester, buggy, go-cart4) Besides the story line missions, there are plenty of side missions. The classic ones like ambulance driving, be a fire fighter, playing the cop and chase criminals, find hidden collectibles, do unique stunt jumps, start illegal races but also newones like driving a truck, going back to school (bike - plane - car - boat), playing the burglar, driving a freight train, dance with the low rider car, ......5) Graphics, it is not a major jump forward but people can walk (no zombie walk), Anti-liasing can be turned on and there are blur effects to mimic hot weather or fast speed during racing.6) Like barbie or Ken, you can 'modify' CJ with tattoos, shoes, trousers, hair style for improvinghis sex appeal and attract women's attention.7) If you train or just by playing, you will get better in shooting, driving, fighting, swimming etc.8) In-game references to previous games like pictures of Candy SUxxx and Love Fist, the appearance of characters of GTAIII and Vice City which is fun. Certainly the Britisch lads.9) Police and passengers are more agressive.10) In VC and GTAIII, water is deadly, in SA you can swim and dive.11) No screen loadingsLess then VC1) Story line : somehow pointless, neccessary to make connections between missions but that's it, VC is simply better.2) Main character CJ : Errand boy.... dull character compared to Antonio Vercetti (VC)3) NPC's : some SA-characters are nerve cracking and very childish -> Catalina, The Truth and OG Loc4) Humour (characters and radio stations): less refined.5) Flying a plane (not heli) with mouse and keyboard is horrible. For finishing the main game, one needs to finish the flight school and that is really painfull and frustating.Overall it is a good game don't get me wrong but it has it's flaws.The proper balance between quantity versus quaility.Vice City is smaller (David vs Golliath) and offers less play time, but beats San Andreas when it comes to story, characters and humour.Now, it is time to move on to GTA 4 (which has it's installation issues)			"

												Back when the game first came out for PlayStation 2 I quickly fell in love with it, it felt so revolutionary.. the amount of freedom and the variety of content completely blew my teenage mind. I remember waking up early in the morning booting up my console and spend entire weekends alone and with friends, just messing around, using cheats, and myth hunting on the local multiplayer.So a few years later when I first bought a computer, I re-purchased this game to reminisce the good old days, that was when I discovered modding for the very first time, I remember spending countless hours a day just fiddling with the game files, so it felt like a completely new experience every time I played. Ever since then, I've beat the storyline a total of 22 times on both platforms, and I've been playing this game for almost 10 years now... I don't think I will ever experience something like this in my lifetime ever again.This game will forever be remembered by me as the pinnacle of the Grand Theft Auto franchise.(Re-write pending) "

												I thought i would never give a game a 10/10. I was wrong.Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a game that separates itself from all others. San Andreas' combination of a great story, great game play and much more is why.Story - 10/10I think the story is very good. You are Carl Johnson. You are coming back from Liberty City because you got a call from your brother Sweet saying your mother just died. All this crazy stuff happens. Its great and really sucks you in. You will want more when you finish the game.Graphics - 8/10The graphics are average at best, but the animations are great. The rest of the game makes up for the graphics.Sound - 10/10The sound in the game is phenomenal. There are many radio stations with a huge variety of music. You can even have a custom radio station with your own tracks! The sound affects are perfect. The voice acting is even BETTER than perfect! Young Maylay completely nails his voice acting role of Carl Johnson (The main character in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas).Controls - 9.6/10The controls are great. It can be confusing at first, but you will get used to them very quickly. If you are used to playing the PS2 version of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, you can buy a PS2 to PC converter so you can use the PS2 controller with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas for the PC. Game play - 10/10Wow. Simply wow. Playing this game is so much fun. I just can't get enough of San Andreas. I still play it today. You will be playing it forever. There is so much to do. You can do missions, destroy crap, dating a girl friend and MUCH, MUCH, MUCH more! I am so amazed at how much fun this game is!Bonus Features/Mods - 10/10After you beat Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, you will still be playing for months, maybe even years like me! You can download mods like a Bigfoot mod, car mods, and all kinds of mods! You can do anything you want after you finish the game. My favorite thing to do after beating the game is searching for Easter eggs and myths. San Andreas is full of them!Final Score - 10/10Simply put. This is the greatest game ever made. Props to Rock Star for making such a amazing game! BUY THIS GAME NOW!			"

												You start as CJ, a black male who is coming back to the hood to defeat rival gangs and doing missions for your homies. You are able to drive bikes, vehicles, boats, planes, etc. You can collect many things to unlock secrets. A lot of missions that needs to be solved, even sidequests like car races, etc. With many mods from the internet you can modifier this game to the maximum. It seems like you can play San Andreas on Multiplayer Mode, i saw a guide on steam about this feature, but im not sure if it's working. But even without the feature, there is a lot to do or things to have fun with. Why u should buy it:-The main characters are talking like gangsters and insulting each other, very cool atmosphere (not like GTA3 were Claude isn't speaking a single word). -You are able to swim and climb over lower walls.-You can do sidequests missions like police, medic or firefighter which rewards you with secrets.-Many things to collect, like 100x graffiti tags, 50x horseshoes, 50x oysters, 50x snapshots.-Rival Gang Territorial Fights, defending or conquering rival gang territorials.-You are able to buy houses/properties so you are having more savegame houses or garages for your vehicles.-Monster Stuns or burglary missions.-You can dress your character individual with new clothes or accessiores, you even get new haircuts.-Tuning your car with new spoilers or body kits and fill it with nitro/nos so you can drive like a boss through San Andreas.-Many things more i just forgot... ;)This game is a must have buy, it's still the best GTA game in my Opinion.

												Given the wonderful environment design, new RPG elements, and extremely well done ""gangsta"" theme, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas comes as close to perfect as anything could.Sure, the instant replay feature was left out, but this is a mostly untouched Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, one of the best games ever made, and now a version of it can be played on the PC with the best controls and graphics available.The soundtrack is inspired, with a heavy emphasis on late-'8s/early '90s rap and alternative rock. What does make it great is that it actually delivers on nearly everything it promises while still being fun to just pick up and play.			"

												Do not buy. 0/10After latest patch, (Which seems to me it ruined PC version because Microsoft own San Andreas and since Xbox has the 10 Year update it has ruined it for everything else.)If you have already bought it, Download a lower patch (v1 or v1.01 - V1.01 is a little better as it contains some bug fixes whilst maintaing the main files for modding in v1)Im not sure if anyone else has this issue, but the game now forever keeps crashing, if either its 5 mins or 1 hour. it'll crash. Some indoor locations also crash. (So please note this could be an issue for you)If you still want San Andreas, Pick up a PS2, Xbox, or the ORIGINAL PC disc retail version.			"

Product received for free
												OK. I'm supposed to write a review for the game that I've been playing for more than 23 hours but loaded page directed me to somewhere else. Speaking for playing hours, 0.1 is for Windows version and the other one is for Mac version. There's no any difference between the two except for the platform which the two are based respectively.In spite of being presented prior to this decade it's still a really a good game, featuring the second largest payable area in the whole series. Main storyline and side missions are challenging, interesting, and durable. One can simply stick to it for months, just like my little brother and young me did.There are bunches of cheating codes there. I'd like to recommend them if you are gonna explore more trivia of this game, but it doesn't apply to missions. Completing whole missions without using any cheats might be hard but it's a good way to enjoy the story itself. Don't worry about money accordingly. You will earn a lot through missions and your properties would ensure you are an upcoming millionaire of the State and San Andreas.Enjoy it!			"

												Game itself is great, don't get me wrong on that. The reason why I'm not recommending this is because the PC port is dreadful. The mouse is automatically inverted(not a problem really, just an opinion), other than that I get about 20 FPS average with V-sync on with my GTX 760, I get better performance on watch_dogs with V-sync on. The part that really gets me about the PC port is when you change some of the mouse settings, the mouse automatically freezes when you're in-game so you can't look around until you reset the settings to default. The mouse sensitivity is horrible, even with the lowest mouse sensitivity possible and turning my gaming mouse down to the lowest DPI possible it was still very sensitive. Really wanted to enjoy this game but the PC port isn't all that good.			"

												One of my biggest pet peeves is when people complain about how hard the mission 'wrong side of the tracks' is. There is a reason why it's one of the first missions in the game people, just keep up with the train, don't crash the bike and you will beat it. JUST FOLLOW THE TRAIN CJ. Thats my little rant aside, this is hands down the best GTA of all time in my opinion. Just the size of the world and the variety of missions alone make it the best. Missions like you driving a bike into a plane before it takes off, blowing up the plane and then jumping out with a parachute. Stealing a plane, jumping out the plane into another plane, killing everyone in the plane then flying that plane back to the airport.Sneaking into a military base, killing everyone there once you're inside, stealing a jetpack and escaping the base by flying out of there using the jetpack while choopers and planes are on your a*s trying to shoot you down. The casino robbery and the final mission, there are so many others like that i could go on forever. It also has the best story in the series in my opinion as well as the best characters like big smoke, ryder, catalina, mike toreno, tenpenny, woozie etc. And the length of the game as well and all the side missions and activities is crazy even though i can beat the game fairly quickly now because i played through it so many times. A first time playthrough will take you around 30 hours. I also have to mention the amazing soundtrack and radio stations its great stuff. This is more of a love letter then a review, its one of my favourite games of all time.10/10 (Masterpiece)			"

												Where GTA V focused on story-telling and immersion, GTA:SA focused on /fun/, and it shows more and more as time goes on..I enjoy the ""immersion"" of V (going to a movie, smoking a bong, watching TV), but I think the game would have been.. more of a game??.. if that content was scrapped in favor of elements you /actually/ interact with, in some way..Where GTA V gives you a hollow mystery that's so mysterious that it /might/ be about a jetpack, SA just /gives you a jetpack/ :) This ""More mature, more serious, ingenious storytelling!!"" angle that Rockstar adopted after San Andreas left a gaping void in the fabric of the gaming universe, and then Saints Row was born. Or Saints Row flourished, at least, because of the general lack of honest /fun/ in the newer GTA entries, anyway..SO! SANNY ANNY! Go find you a lawnmower and bust the nitro cheat on it! Go to the top of that super-tall building with the parachute on top, cheat-spawn a four-wheeler and ride it all the way down to the ground! Go abuse the RC Baron for some miniaturized stunt-flying! Get fat as hell and attempt to run! Do a cross-country wheelie! Sell ""ice cream""! Accidentally fall off of a steep coastal area into the ocean and spend a whole day swimming back to land!! ;) Enjoy not owning a smartphone! Take over a hood in the hood from some hoods while wearing a hood! Read the word hood til it makes no sense!Bias and potential rose-tinted glasses aside, GTA:SA is loaded with goodies, has fine controls, and still has an active modding and (modded) multiplayer community..

												""All you had to do was follow the damn train CJ!""It may seem like a relic from when games were less cushioned. There were no autosave features, no HD textures, and no friends asking to go play darts. Nevertheless, GTA San Andreas is still a stellar example of wonderful and varied world design, and it's attention to detail rivals that of many modern open-world games. This game will provided nearly limitless hours of fun and ridiculous freeroaming, with a decent story to back it up. GTA San Andreas is well worth a pricetag of $60.00, let alone $15.00.			"

												Nope, nope nope nopety nope, do NOT get this game on Steam. GTA San Andreas is one of the greatest videogames in history, however the Steam version is garbage.Pros: Do I really need to talk about how great this game is? If you're not familiar with this game, then you probably don't know that much about videogames.Cons:1- It crashes too much, and the mouse usually stops functioning with the game.2- The Steam version is mod-proof, meaning that if you attempted to install a mod, the game would crash and you might need to reinstall the game.3- It doesn't function with controllers, though I'm not sure if that's a problem with the Steam version or all versions of the game.If you want my advice: Get V1 of GTA San Andreas on the PC, or get it on a PlayStation or an Xbox console. If you can manage to overlook the cons of this version, then there's no problem with getting it here.			"

												My personal favorite of the PS2 Grand Theft Autos - an absolutely massive world, tons of things to do throughout the entire environment, a decent story spanning three entire cities, wonderful music....this game has it all. I can't recommend this game enough.The one mark against it that I would give the PC version is that it does not have any 16:9 screen resolutions by default - you'll have to do some modding yourself in order to get it to work in the appropriate resolution which is extremely disappointing. But aside from that minor technical issue, an absolutely wonderful game, and a must-have for any person looking to build their game collection.			"

												♥♥♥♥♥CJ WE GOTTA GET BACK TO THE HOOD*ahem*A word of warning: Rockstar has changed the Steam version of San Andreas from its original release. It has native Xbox controller support and higher-fidelity graphics on par with the 2014 re-release, but also less resolution options, less music tracks (check here[www.neogaf.com] for a list of what was removed) and breaks some old saves. You can find information on unofficial fixes here. Gamers' Steam reviews, as always when things change in any way, are 'taking Rockstar to task' over this. Not that they don't have a point, but still.Anyway.San Andreas is the fifth game in the Grand Theft Auto series, released in 2004. You've probably heard of the series if you're browsing this website, but if you haven't it's basically an open-world crime simulator that also lets you simulate low-rent gangster movies. This particular release has somewhat clunky controls and the graphics were bad even when it came out, if still charming in their own way.But I ultimately think San Andreas is the best game in the series, and not just because it has 'the most to do'. Grand Theft Auto V is technically higher on the 'fun scale' with superior gameplay, superior graphics and more optional side activities; it's certainly fun to play. The titles before SA are really more valuable as gaming history, since they were even more janky & limited, and even more cliched, than SA. And while SA is a functional game that absolutely has its charm - I'm partial to its pastiche of the 90s myself - that's not the main reason I'm saying it's the best.No, my reasoning has to do with the story and the tone. GTA V's story is interesting enough in a doofy crime capers way, but the tone of that game is ultimately aggressively nihilistic and uncaring about almost anything within itself. Not to say these elements aren't present in San Andreas, but they're not nearly as strong or disheartening here.GTA IV is better in this regard, I'd say, but it's not off the hook. It tried to be more serious, and while it made strides in that direction, the weight of its open-world gameplay ambitions ultimately hamstrung its story. I didn't mind its more muted tone, 'realistic' driving and lack of cheat codes (for the base game anyway), but there's no getting around the fact that having a main character who bemoans the atrocities of the Balkan Wars he survived but is perfectly able to wantonly run over pedestrians is...odd. The final act of the story resembling a cheap mafia film didn't exactly help either.San Andreas, by contrast, doesn't just exist primarily to ""poke fun"" at American society so much as it tries to tell a story about a West Coast gangbanger with a heart of gold, trying to do right for his lower-class neighborhood, family and gang within the moral construct (and repressive society) he was born and raised in. It's ultimately more genuine than V because it cares enough about its characters not to utterly derail itself every time the game displays pathos for them. It's also not self-important enough to pretend that it wouldn't be a bad thing if it did do that. Perhaps most importantly, it's self-aware enough not to be stony-faced at every turn it takes.The characters themselves might not be particularly more savory, and certainly there's stereotypical/exaggerated behavior going on, but at least SA doesn't furiously punch in every direction or practically flash ""LAUGH AT THESE SAD LOSERS WHO ARE ALSO YOU, LOSER"" on the screen every time you see them interact with each other.Not that this game is a literary masterpiece by any means, but it's the closest the series has come to that level. And while GTA IV was also trying to operate on the same level, albeit with its own direction and its own flaws, V was just a step back in this regard. There's always been puerile satire of society and voyeuristic displays of women in the 3D GTA games, including in San Andreas, and it's always gotten disheartening if you played for long enough, but SA...isn't quite as bad in this regard, I feel. There's enough determination and hope in the story for the game not to crash and burn at least, although it's long enough that it does drag in parts.I still resent whenever the game shoves boobs, 'sexy wimmins' and other series-standard female objectification in my face without comment, of course. Nothing is perfect. I also think it's still a bit weird that CJ comes across as a pretty decent dude, perhaps the most 'good' in the series, trying to do what he can and make the best of a pretty bad situation, and yet the game still gives you the option to go on classic GTA rampages.Maybe there's something to be said for the tension between open-world game structure and any semblance of a plot. Whatever the case may be, San Andreas doesn't gel perfectly. GTA IV suffered from this problem too, and both games - hell, pretty much the entire series - also suffer from a number of frustrating missions. Following a damn train was never so difficult.The game world is obviously not as realistic as V's due to the technological constraints of 2004, which means that the game isn't trying to sell itself as a perfect graphical model of Real Life™ that's fatally flawed by crazy AI behavior. The game looks enough like a game that it's not quite as jarring when something insane happens on the street next to you. (San Andreas' modding support is at least better than V's, and I say this because I couldn't find anywhere else in the review to stick it.)Honestly, I don't know if I'd call this one of the best games ever made, but I think it's still a classic in its genre. Pick it up if it's on sale and you're interested.			"

												Ok. This game is absolutely amazing in every way possible. I just wanted to get this out of the way right here:Here are the specs of my PC:Processor: Intel Pentium CPU: B980 @ 2.40GHz RAM: 4GB Operating System: Windows 10 Type: 64-bit operating system x64-based processor Graphics Card: Intel HD GraphicsAnd guess what? I'm getting over 100FPS! This game is well optimized, and has a great story. There is so much you can do on the PC version that you can't do on the PS2/XB versions. Amazing mod support, great story, great gameplay, and good graphics and frame rate for a terrible PC like mine! Even though I'm running the game at low graphics, you can't even tell a difference.The game's story is very long, but it's so open-world, that it feels like San Andreas is just as big as the GTA V version of Los Santos. I also noticed that this game along with a couple other GTA games has gore in it, which makes it a little more graphic. I'm totally ok with it too, just thought I'd bring it up.The gameplay mechanics are a little different than the PS2/XB versions of the game. There's no auto aim on PC (unless if you play with the controller mod), but PC gaming is really advanced and I understand why they don't have auto aim for mice. It'll be really easy to get a shot with auto aim if your playing on PC. I also know that the PC version is missing a cheat code from the console version, and there are a few changes to the environment, because the console version and the PC version are not exactly the same either. It's alright though.I'll give this a 9/10, and here is my list of PROS and CONS on the PC version:PROS:Great mod supportGreat storyGreat gameplayGreat performance/optimizationOPEN WORLD BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Well, that should go under gameplay)And it actually works on bad PC's!CONS:Missing cheat codeEnviromental changes between PC and consoleSlight gameplay mechanic changesBad controller support (you have to use the controller mod to have good controller support)No intro at the beginning of the game (for me at least, I don't know about other people)Well, this is my review for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas on the PC. I love it, and I'd play it any day.			"

												Don't get me wrong, I LOVE san andreas, but I just don't love this PC adaptation of it. There are frequent bugs and control problems and they have recently released patches that remove some of the songs from the radio in the game because of copyright disputes. This is one of the few cases where automatic patching is a genuinely horrible thing			"

Then when I launched the game, my mouse wont click and the screen wont move when i try to look around.The BUGS are so annoying as hell and I'm raging because I wanted to play this again. I can forgive you removing the songs but please fix the bugs. Good thing I bought this on sale.			"

												As other reviews have stated, I would have recomended this game several weeks ago. I got it on a steam sale for $1.99 and it was one of the best deals I've gotten for such a great game. However ♥♥♥♥♥tar and Steam have literally broken this game. In order to even accept saves from previous versions, a mod must be downloaded (if they weren't deleted when you started the game). They also removed 17 songs from the radio stations. Things such as this prove to be the fly in the ointment of auto-updated games. Sadly, I must agree with the conesnsus: pirate this game or buy a physical copy so that you may enjoy the game as originally intended.			"

												The game itself isn't bad. It's my favorite gta game. But, i'm can't recomend this steam version to anyone. It's been absolutely butchered. I've only been able to play it about 5 times, 4 times when i first bought it, when suddenly it stopped working and wouldn't launch. I tried everything. Then, after the update deleted my save files i was able to play it again for a few minutes. Today it it refused to launch again. Besides all that, a lot of songs from the original game have been removed and the controls are a bit difficult. I haven't even been able to play the game long enough to tell you what's wrong with it because it simply doesn't work. 6/10 if you can get it to work,Save yourself the pain and either download it elsewhere or snag a ps2 and a physical copy of the game.Update: After the patch i was able to play, but lost my save files and had to start all over. It works okay. I still wouldn't recoment buying it.			"

Thanks for showing us the paying customers that if you buy something you don't own it or deserve to. B.S like this needs to change as it is belived that if one pays for something they own it complete. In my opinion to sell something then to take something out its wrong and is and should not ever have happened. Furthermore the industry is so money hungry its sick and its sad to see how everything now can be striped and taken from you even though you payed for it. Its theft in my opinion.			"

												Ahhhh, the classic Grand Theft Auto Series, so many good memories of this game, from younge and old... this game was a staple of the GTA series often said to be the BEST GTA in the whole series. So let me go over the Pros and Cons.Pros:- LONG Story MANY hours will go into this game and most will not be Regretted.- The Game has a HUUUUUUUGE map to explore, and find the oh so many secrets.- The Customization of your character is almost infinite, with so MANY different variaties to choose from you could deck out your character as much as you'd like.-SO many cars to choose from, including Bicycles and and Motorcycles, most cars able to be customized and outfitted.-Your character can learn different fighting styles as he travles, making him versatile in brawls.-You can Swim, HOLY CRAP a Grown man who can swim.-You can recruit grang members into a posse, and do drive bys or have massive gun fights.-You can claim territory and have massive gang wars with the 3 other Opposing gangs.-SO MANY weapons to pick from, including Assualt Rifles, SMGs, Pistols.-Many shop interirors and building interiors to check out and see.-Many Secret Interiors and other Secrets around the world, for you to explore and find.-Its made by Rockstar I mean COME on Rockstar games is BAD♥♥♥♥♥-Lag is non-exsistant.-Nice Musical pieces on all Radio Stations, and a few Radio Talkshows have some funny dialogue.-The game isn't too easy or too hard, some missions being SUPER easy, while some will be a challenge.Cons:-Graphics are not exactly the best.-Controls on PC can be confusing (Especially for thoese of Us who played it on PS2)-The save feature in this game, is annoying. (You have to drive ALL the way back to a home you own JUST to save.)-The Music and Speech in the game, can often feel repetitive and just plain boring.-Missions have NO checkpoints, so if you die YOU have to do that mission ALL over again.-Modding is hard to do in this game.Would I recommend this game? Yes, I would infact i'd recommend it to anyone whos already played the game, or IS completely new to Rockstar Games, or the GTA franchise. The game is overall one of the few games I play, that don't require mods to BE fun or MORE fun.			"

												Hmm, depends what you mean by ""reccomend,"" as to what my answer would be.Firstly, I got this as a free D/L with GTA V (pre-order) so, it was free. However, I had the non-steam (retail disk) version a few years back, so thought it would be fun to relive the old days, before GTA V came out. The game is crappy now. It is poorly optimised, most of the songs I remember are gone, and the resolution is very low, even on its highest settings. I thought this was perculiar, as the resolution was great, when I first got the game in 2010/2011. Having done some research, I found out that R* patched the game, to the point where it was essentially a port of the MOBILE game. This dissapointed me greatly. In conclusion, no, I don't reccomend this. If you got it free with GTA V, its okay, because it's free. However, don't buy this on it's own.Really, my honest opinion is, if you want to play this game, torrent it. This gives you the genuine experience of what the game was intended to be upon release. However, if you don't want to break the law, GTA V is my answer.			"

												In October San Andreas became 10 years old. I replayed it because of nostalgia and I was shockingly surprised to see that a big part of its soundtrack was removed (18 songs = 11% of the total number of songs if my information is correct). And I felt it while progressing through the game. Towards the end I was flipping radio channels to get a song I haven't heard that much and it was becoming increasingly difficult to do so.Even though I enjoyed it, I can't recommend it. Not like this. This recent patch which did more damage than improvements (the game crashed a few times for me but usually it ran ok). If you want an old school GTA game, get Vice City. It has better mission structure and a better world (SA has a bigger world and a better setting for a GTA game but it doesn't use it as well as Vice City did).			"

												My Opinion About The Game (Without Story Spoilers) : Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas is an Open World TPS made and published by Rockstar Studios . I probaby don't need to intouduce you to the series. I didn't play Vice City (I will and when I did I'll delete this part of the review) and all the others before that but I played all the others after this one. For me it seems like this one has the biggest world that you can actually go to. Like I said I didn' played the other games before this one (yet) but I think this has the best story out of all of them. I like all of them though. The only con I can think of this game considering it's age are the flying tutorials and missions they are awful hard. You can say that I'm a noob but I've seen a lot of people having the same problem. So I recommend playing atleast that part of the game with a controller but overall I recommend a controller for the game because of the vehicles. There's a small negative part of the game which is small because it doesn't  happen if you do this like I say , there's a part of the game where you have to take over territories . And theres a small territory named Jefferson Motel. That territory is so small that enemy gang members doesn't spawn there , so you need to lure them from other territories nearby. But if you took over all the territories except that one you gonna have a hard time capturing it. So I recomend capturing that one first. There are other negatives  which I did a researc on when I noticed the same things which  are regarding the Steam version not the game itself. Rockstar added a patch to the game which removed songs , option for changing resoultions and something with SAMP isn't right either . I played the crack GTA SA with SAMP and it barely had crashes but with the Steam version it crashes at least 1 time in 1 hour but usually around 2-3 times. And they messed up people's saves but that didn't affect me because I got the game after that. I completed the game's story 100%  all the missions all the territories all the stats like Respect , Stamina , Muscle theese kind of things , schools etc. I really like the game's story I like the characters I like that I don't have to go to bowling in every second. If you have Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 and SAMP doesn't start properly run Steam in administrator mode and set both GTA SA and samp exe to run in Windows SP3 (on Windows 8.1) , Windows 98 (on Windows 10)  and both in administrator mode. This made the multiplayer worked even tho you still gonna have crashes because of the crappy port.Graphics : 9 (The game came out in 2005)Audio : 9 (The Steam version itself would be 7 because of the removal of some songs)Gameplay : 10 (If you want to play SAMP on the Steam version you gonna have a hard time and I don't even know about what's up with the modding in it , considering GTA V's status on that)Story : 9 Replayability : 8 (8 because of the hell in the flying missions)Value : 6 (7 If you only buy it for the Single Player )Overall I recommend the game mainly if you only want to play in single player or if you don't mind a lot of crashes then multiplayer too. Well I wouldn't complain much about it after the GTA IV port. Enjoy the game !			"

												===WARNING SPOILERS BELOW DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT THE PLOT TO BE SPOILED===Grand Thegt Auto is a game developed by ME  at my house in 2006. IT's a flash indie game made with the source engine and it has cross compatability with both lindows and windux. Right off the bat you are thrust into the shoes of Coldsteel the gang banger aka Carl Johntron working for the illuminati fish capers known as CRASH who are corrupt and work to further the secret agenda of single black women everywhere. After a plane crash the preisdent calls in Chill iron to come sell drugs to kids across california so CRASH can operate in secret and save the world from the russian mobsters importing illegal lobsters to suburban housewives in the US. But the game takes a twist when Icemetal the gang banger is thrown in crime for a prison he did not commet. His brother Small Vapor turns out to be working with the russians and you must break out of prison using your streeet knowledge to board a giant airship made of lobsters and kill your brother. Afterwards you are shown a cutscene where your mother turns out to be a lobster and you kill yourself wiht your brothers corpse due to your grief. If you get the bad end then CRASH loses all their funding and the russians ivnade us and the cold war breaks out. There is no good end yet because I haven't got it yet. 7/10			"

												In October San Andreas became 10 years old. I replayed it because of nostalgia and I was shockingly surprised to see that a big part of its soundtrack was removed (18 songs = 11% of the total number of songs if my information is correct). And I felt it while progressing through the game. Towards the end I was flipping radio channels to get a song I haven't heard that much and it was becoming increasingly difficult to do so.Even though I enjoyed it, I can't recommend it. Not like this. This recent patch which did more damage than improvements (the game crashed a few times for me but usually it ran ok). If you want an old school GTA game, get Vice City. It has better mission structure and a better world (SA has a bigger world and a better setting for a GTA game but it doesn't use it as well as Vice City did).			"

												I've had a phyiscal disc of this game for a long time now, and purely for convenience I picked it up on Steam a while ago. However, the recent update essentially stripped content and broke saves. As of this time I recommend pirating the game instead of purchasing it on Steam, because right now you would be paying the same amount for less content than you would have gotten a few months ago. Either that or find a used copy on Ebay. I have tried contacting Rockstar on the issue and of course they haven't replied at all. Rockstar has gone on my list of companies to not buy games from anymore, right next to Ubisoft and EA... so good going with that. Wonder how much content they will remove from GTA IV/V in a few years.			"

												Finished this a while ago, but today figured I'd load up the old save and wreak havoc. Problem is, when I loaded the game, it brought me to the first cutscene and the beginning of the game. I try a restart. Again, same thing. Pity, it's a good game, but this port is ruined by a sloppy system of saves being ruined by updates.There's apparently a user made save editor that can convert the game's saves to newer versions an save them, but I tried it and it isn't working.All I can say is Rockstar, we get it.

There are still some things the Saints Row series does better (ability to shoot out of cars with more than a SMG, 360 aiming while in a car, cruise control, gang warfare is better), San Andreas is STILL worth playing.

												GTA San Andreas is, in my opinion, one of the best gta game ever made and even seeing the game cover brings back so many wonderful memories of playing this masterpiece.This game has an interesting storyline packed with nice voice acting and humour. Trying to help CJ achieve the greatness is very challenging.The reasons why GTA San Andreas is so highly rated are it's huge map, never-gets-old game play and fantastic soundtrack. The missions are always new, fresh and non repetitious, that's why it has a great replay value.			"

												I'll be honest: I like San Andreas a HELL of a lot more than I do GTA IV. There are still some things the Saints Row series does better (ability to shoot out of cars with more than a SMG, 360 aiming while in a car, cruise control, gang warfare is better), San Andreas is STILL worth playing. Just don't do any of the gang wars during the first Los Santos chapter. You don't get to keep any progress in it when you're exiled.			"

(By the way, the song is also in the game. Coincidence? I think NOT!)[Verse One] Just wakin up in the mornin gotta thank God I don't know but today seems kinda odd No barkin from the dog, no smog And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog (damn) I got my grub on, but didn't pig out Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out (Whassup?)

												Having been a fan of the series since GTA III, and seeing that each game has its own pros and cons (not excluding this one), I have to admit GTA: San Andreas is still my favorite.  The stoyline / voice acting is arguably the best in the series, with no shortage of wacky characters as you'd come to expect from a Rockstar game.  Plently of diverse missions and locations to explore (a massive map for its time) with exellent character customization.I only recently purchased San Andreas on Steam but have sunk countless hours since its intial release on the PS2.  It's definitely worth the price tag for this classic, and a no-brainer if you happen upon it on sale.			"

												First of all , I would like to say that this game is a triple AAA clasic!One of the classic games that everyone should have the opportunity to play !But lets get this review organized:Graphics - 65/100To evaluate the grapics you have to keep on mind that this game is , effectivelly , a game from 2004, so you cannot be expecting to be tremendously beautyfull, it is beautyfull if you compare it to the other games from this especific generation.But one thing I have to admit, I love those beaches! Los Santos <3Sounds- 75/100Oh gosh , how I love to get in a car and live again those 90s musics . One of the things that I did not like about it , is a recent update that took some of my joys off. Copying one guy ----- ""Rockstar you a busta! "" Story-98/100.PERFECT STORY ! In this game you can live the life of Carl Johnson ( C.J) that came back to his city to assist to his mother funeral. As he gots here , he realizes that his gangsta crew was weak and dying and the others crew like the Ballas were getting better and bigger.He knew that he cannot turn his face around and ignore his familly , so he does a couple things to help the crew. He feels part of the team again and starts to live the thing again. You will be CJ that will try to seek the truth about his mothers death and will try to raise once again the glory of the Groove Street gang.Gameplay- 80/100You have 3 citys - Los Santos , San Fierro , Las Venturas , and 2 ""country "" zones , the Desert one , and the mountain one .Thats enough ! You have 10000000 things to do!In the end i consider that this game evaluation is 80/100 because it is an analyze from 2015, if this was an analyze from 2004 I would give without any doubt 99/100			"

What I liked about the game 	Likable characters, like Carl, Big smoke, Rider and Caesar who are well voice-acted. Samuel L Jackson also does a fantastic job of voice acting officer Tenpenny.	Brilliant and well done cut-scenes which have a comedy element to them. 	Fantastic story, you re-build your reputation in San Andreas. The game is very well paced. Sub-missions, new areas and weapons unlock as you progress through the game.  	This game seems to have an endless about of missions. You have the main missions plus you have a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of sub-missions like ambulance, cops, taxi, Freight, arena, the list goes on. The sub-missions are very rewarding as well, for example, once you complete the ambulance missions your health increases to 150% and the cop missions increases your armour to 150%. When you complete the arena unique vehicles spawn in the arena car park. 	Plenty of things to spend your money on; like clothes, jewellery, businesses, cribs and cars. 	Large selection of vehicles to drive, from cars, planes, boats, and motorbikes. Each vehicle type also has its own driving school which when you complete unlocks unique vehicles. 	An amazing soundtrack. My favourite radio station was probably radio Los Santos.	San Andreas has loads of cheats. I remember me and my friend used to try out each cheat; good times.      What I disliked or was disappointed with	It's a same they couldn't have added more weapons to the game.	You will be better off using a controller for this game, because flying isn't easy with keyboard and mouse and you also can't use auto aim.	The original version of San Andreas has been replaced with a HD version from a mobile port and as a result 16 songs have been lost. The music hasn't been restored to the game. (link below to songs which have been lost).Conclusion One of my all time favourite games and in my opinion is the best game in the series. San Andreas is up there with half-life 2.  If you like vice city, GTA 3 or any 3rd person open-world shooters, then I highly recommend you buy this game. Final In game progress 86.10%. 96/100Linkhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/12120/discussions/0/613941122659584549/ "

												Even with it's age, this game is still one of the best Grand Theft Auto games out there. Funny and nostalgic.If you get bored with Vanilla, there's;+SAMP+MTAand +tons of other mods to mess around with, so quit reading reviews and catch this on a sale.			"

												Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is by far one of the greatest GTA games of all time! Don't let the graphics fool you, this has a great antagonist, an amazing storyline, hilarious characters (I'm looking at you big smoke! :D) and just an overall great feel to the game. I remember playing this when i was a kid and it was on the PS2, it was so good, and to be able to come back to this game after all these years is amazing, If your new to the series, I'd 110% recommend either buying this game or Vice City. Don't bother with GTA V, now don't get me wrong, GTA V is great and its your choice, but San Andreas is just amazing in every single way and you can do a lot more in San Andreas than you can in GTA V.

												GTA: SA is probably the pinnacle of the GTA gaming experience. Still one of the best sand-boxes in my mind. The world is so open, and interesting, and there is no comparison. A brilliant game! Excellent graphics (for the time), and filled with so many things to do, you probably will eventually find yourself going nuts because it will engulf you and all your time!			"

												Don't be fooled by the low amount of hours I have on this (I originally played over a trillion hours on this game on my PS2 back in the day).Now, GTA SA is in my humble opinion the BEST GTA game in the series.. It was just right....Great storyGreat mapGreat gameplayGreat music in stereoGreat gunplayEPIC CHEATS (Come on... ANY GTA player who played this game will tell you they googled some cheats for this and started playing with flying cars and no police and and inifinite ammo with cars that basically DESTORY other cars upon BARELY touching them XD)Great graphics (For the time ofcourse... around 10 years... looks good to me)Overall I played this game soooooooo much and I just love it. Buy it. Love it. and play the crap out of it untill GTA 5 Hits us soon on the PC :D10/10 Grove street 4 life dawgs P.S BALLAS SUX			"

												Terrible since the last patch as of 11/2014. Ignore the mostly positive reviews - they are almost entirely from before the game-wrecking patch. Most of the reviews for the game today are rightly negative.The patch basically breaks functionality and removes things that were there and/or working fine before. Songs have been pulled from the soundtrack. Certain standard 16x9 resolution options are no longer available. See the other negative reviews for other problems. It is appalling that a Company would break functionality to any game after users have paid for it, to say nothing of wrecking an old classic after leaving it intact for years. Just because the EULA allows them to do so doesn't make it proper or ethical.			"

												Last week, I'd have said this game was a fine set of mammaries. Now, however, without 17 songs that helped to solidify this as an incredible game, less resolution options, and newfound save game incompatibility, it's now just a dull shadow of it's former glory. I'm uninstalling this game now.  I realize it may be sorta petty, but at the same time, it has but a modicum of the appeal it had a week ago.Rockstar must not distribute a single regard about the community. But, with a name like Rockstar, should it be a suprise that they just do whatever the fxxk impulsive, and irrational crap they wish?			"

												I would pass on this unless it is dirt cheap.  I've run into at least three progression stopping bugs that, considering the amount of time this game has been out, no one seems to care about enough to fix.  It looks alright on high resolutions and settings, but things like dodgy controller support (inverting camera will invert the movement during minigames, generic 'press joypad 4' prompts, etc), the aforementioned bugs, and all of the little hitches make this a really poor pc port that I hope will not be indicative of the GTA V port.

												This game is a classic Grand Theft Auto and it has a great storyline. It has many customization features that the other GTAs don't have. It's graphics aren't as good as the newer ones, but were good for it's generation of games. The gameplay overall is great and I reccomend it to anyone who loves the Grand Theft Auto series. One thing that you can't do though is flip your car over, wich is a bit annoying when you are driving on a mission.			"

												Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is by far one of the greatest GTA games of all time! Don't let the graphics fool you, this has a great antagonist, an amazing storyline, hilarious characters (I'm looking at you big smoke! :D) and just an overall great feel to the game. I remember playing this when i was a kid and it was on the PS2, it was so good, and to be able to come back to this game after all these years is amazing, If your new to the series, I'd 110% recommend either buying this game or Vice City. Don't bother with GTA V, now don't get me wrong, GTA V is great and its your choice, but San Andreas is just amazing in every single way and you can do a lot more in San Andreas than you can in GTA V.

												GTA: SA is probably the pinnacle of the GTA gaming experience. Still one of the best sand-boxes in my mind. The world is so open, and interesting, and there is no comparison. A brilliant game! Excellent graphics (for the time), and filled with so many things to do, you probably will eventually find yourself going nuts because it will engulf you and all your time!			"

												Don't be fooled by the low amount of hours I have on this (I originally played over a trillion hours on this game on my PS2 back in the day).Now, GTA SA is in my humble opinion the BEST GTA game in the series.. It was just right....Great storyGreat mapGreat gameplayGreat music in stereoGreat gunplayEPIC CHEATS (Come on... ANY GTA player who played this game will tell you they googled some cheats for this and started playing with flying cars and no police and and inifinite ammo with cars that basically DESTORY other cars upon BARELY touching them XD)Great graphics (For the time ofcourse... around 10 years... looks good to me)Overall I played this game soooooooo much and I just love it. Buy it. Love it. and play the crap out of it untill GTA 5 Hits us soon on the PC :D10/10 Grove street 4 life dawgs P.S BALLAS SUX			"

But worst of all having completed the game a few times it seems that now even the mouse is not working as it should, having to pause the game 10+ times i short succesion just to get the mouse to unfreeze is simply unaaceptable because it used to be fine before this absolutely unnecessery update.

												GTA SA is one of the best games I have ever played. However, since I love it so much I have created an idol out of it in my life. As a Christian, I am not allowed to play it as I asked myself, ""would Christ play this game with me?"" So, I put to death that which I love and deny myself since Christ, when he came down to earth, denied himself to do the will of The Father and died for our sins. I challenge my brothers and sisters in Christ to do the same and follow Christ, our forerunner and saviour. Be strong and deny yourself to do His will and not ours. I know it's tough but, when you realize what Christ has done for us and remove yourself (deny oneself) from the throne of your life and allow Christ to sit there. Only then can we truly serve Him. God bless and Godspeed.			"

												For the past ten years, GTA: San Andreas has been one of my all time favorite video games, unsurpassed even with the release of GTA V. However, I can no longer recommend it. I got the steam version free as a complimentary gift for preordering GTA V, and decided to relive a bit of nostalgia, only to be horrified at the result. A game that worked even a year ago while I was tinkering with it, is now completely unplayable.The resolutions have changed to cause constant stretching even with fixes, including higher resolutions completely removed, and a plethora of graphical mishaps to boot. As mentioned before, though this is a more minor issue for me, a great deal of the music has been removed from the game completely. The game has always had poor performance on PC, with a cap of 25 fps, and completely broken physics if you dare to surpass it, but now it is even worse on all fronts, to the point where random events in the game will cause fatal crashes. Mods are also no longer supported, just in case you thought you were going to install a fix for that.This makes me fear for the game I just spent $60 on, and proves to me that Rockstar's PC support has not improved at all since GTA IV's abysmal port. Hopefully I'm wrong. Stay the hell away from the Steam version of San Andreas.			"

But what I love in this game the most are myths, one of the most interesting things in this game, you can drive around whole San Andreas visit many places investigate them find something plus there are many interesting easter eggs too... I won't tell you more you better play it yourself you will definately enjoy it.			"

Rather than pay for new license they removed the songs and made the game even worse as a port of the mobile version. Geez thanks a lot R*. I don't know what happened to the company, R*used to be good and trustworthy but has gone to♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's shameful that the greed of big corporations ruin the game and rip off the customers who bought this. I'm happy that I still have the ps2 version and it still works although the disc is kind of scratched, hopefully R* won't send someone to pick up that retail version. Because this feels almost the same, time for me to get a retail version somehow for pc as the update ♥♥♥♥ed up all the mod support as well. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OLD REVIEW BEFORE THE RIP OFF PATCHIgnore my playing time on steam, I use a downgraded version for mods sake. I used to have this on my ps2. After that I got this for PC, just because with mods this classic gets even better than GTA V in my opinion.			"

												Terrible since the last patch as of 11/2014. Ignore the mostly positive reviews - they are almost entirely from before the game-wrecking patch. Most of the reviews for the game today are rightly negative.The patch basically breaks functionality and removes things that were there and/or working fine before. Songs have been pulled from the soundtrack. Certain standard 16x9 resolution options are no longer available. See the other negative reviews for other problems. It is appalling that a Company would break functionality to any game after users have paid for it, to say nothing of wrecking an old classic after leaving it intact for years. Just because the EULA allows them to do so doesn't make it proper or ethical.			"

												This game is old but gold.GTA San Andreas is the most sold game in the history of the GTA series. There are a number of good reasons for why this is the case. The first game where you could do whatever you want. Fly airplanes and helicopters. Cars and motorbikes. Tanks. Boats. Even JETPACKS. Unlike some GTA's (GTA IV) you can even swim under water.You can personalise your style by going to the barbershop. You can even go to the gym to get ripped! :D You can learn new fighting skills by practicing boxing in the gym... How long do I keep going? YOU CAN EVEN PLAY ARCADE GAMES IN THE GAME ITSELF. A GAME WITHIN A GAME :DOkay, now to the story line. The missions are great and exciting. The characters have distinctive personalities which allows you to bond with them. For example, ""Big Smoke"". He was fat, funny, friendly and generally likeable. There was OG LOC. Funny gansta wannabe. I dont want to spoil the story, you just have to play it to understand.This is truly a golden and original game, especially for the time it was released. The graphics arent as good as GTA IV and V. But you have to understand that it's not always about how good the game looks. The story and all the other small details matter more that how good the graphics are. Games these days need to learn from original games like these.			"

												This game has everything. Better than GTA V ? Yes. GTA:SA is a bloody classic. The storyline, the weapons, missions ( we don0t talk about the learning how to fly mission ). Yes the graphics are not great but mods exist. Alot of them infact. Besides the missions,  story etc there's is always the amazing feeling of having a swaggy♥♥♥♥♥suit and car and go to the forests/lakes in search for the numerous myths!

												In my childhood, this game was a holy grail in gaming history. Mainly because it was my first free-roam game I played that I could aim in. If you're looking to play this game, you're probably going to need a PS3 USB controller to play, otherwise the controls can get complicated. Also, make sure you look up the cheats for this game. Many of the cheats are worth using when you're alone and bored.			"

												This is an awesome game in itself. However, this is one of the few times that the PC version is not exactly the best. This version can be very, very glitchy. I don't recommend using cheats on it, because that can mess up your game if your not careful. The controls can also be a problem, and you may want to configure with them. I do not have too big a problem with flight. If you have the console versions, don't feel obligated to buy this version. If you do, just be careful. The game is very fun, and the overworld is amazing. However, there are some very tedious missions, and buying a console version won't fix that. All these problems really cancel out with what is great with this game.			"

												GTA San Andreas takes place in the State of San Andreas, composed of 3 main cities (Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas) and other smaller onesit takes place in the year of 1992, and we play as Carl Johnson, aka 'CJ', a Gangster that returns to Los Santos after the murder of his mother.+ MASSIVE open world for the time, and it still feels big today+ Varied locations, like the 3 different big cities, countrysides, desert, beaches, mountains.+ Great graphics for the time (looks a bit dated now, but tolerable)+ Great gameplay for the time+ Big selection of cars, Motorcycles, bikes, boats, Planes, Helicopters and even a Jetpack!+ Good arcade driving physics+ The story mode is very big, with many fun missions and memorable characters (Though IMO the story itself is not that great, but it's still good)+ Great, varied selection of weapons+ The GTA game with the most side missions and stuff to do yet.+ Parachuting was introduced to the series for the first time+ Swimming got introduced to the series for the first time+ Vehicle customization was introduced (some cars, like lowriders and tuners, have more options than most)+ RPG elements added, like Stamina improvement, fat/muscular system, multiple fighting styles, independent weapon skill, driving/riding/flying skill (and schools for each), etc.+ Massive character customization, besides the clothes, that can be changed independently (stuff like hats, chains, watches, bandanas, jackets, shorts, pants, etc.) , we can change the Haircut, beard, add tattoos, get fat, skinny, muscular, and everything in between.+ Great soundtrack, as expected from a GTA (The Dust is my favorite radio station, but most of them are great) + HUGE mod community- Collectables, there are SO MANY of them (only matters if you want 100% completion and don't like collectables)- Gets stretched visuals on widescreens (To fix this I recommend the widescreen Patch by ThirteenAG)- The ""Gangsta"" style can get a bit annoying, or fun, it's a matter of taste. (I'm not really into this)I also recommend the ""silent patch"", by silent, that fix many bugs of the gameOne of the best games (the favorite of many) and the one that introduced me to the series, part of my childhood, even better than V in some ways, Completely recommended!

												This is the best GTA game ever in the series for me. I have played GTA V on the PS3 and PS4 and GTA V comes a very close 2nd to SA. GTA SA is all about the 90's; gangsters,drugs,guns(in a video game though) and being a 90's kid it brings back many memories back too. It's amazing how well done the characters are from the likes of the voice acting to acting to even visuals(even for an old game). The story line is briliant too, it just keeps you coming back for more. The gameplay mechanics and graphics surely will seem old but you will still be able to have great fun. The only shameful thing with the PC version is with the updates that have removed certain stuff such as songs but you can easily use community mods to work around them. Do not be put off buying this game because of the removal of stuff because there is a work around! You can also get a really cheap disc copy from Amazon which will be the original game from day one. As ICE CUBE would say""chickity 'get the game' yo self before you wreck yo self"". Grove Street awaits you my ♥♥♥♥♥z. "

												Sitting back years after having beat this game I thought that it was totally worth buying and playing it through one more time. One more time to try to do the most from what there is to be done in this game and 60 hours were not enough to do not more than 70% of what I had aimed for after after beating it. (But there's so many other games to try out there, so I decided to move on)GTA: San Andreas is one of the best mafia openworld sandbox action 3rdPS games i've ever played in my life.The graphical improvements from GTA: Vice City are noticable. The voice acting is perfect. The map is huge compared to the games before it. In a big world full of choices you make your way through a very interesting, fun, crazy, and dramatic story about brotherhood, friendship, hunger, corruption and betrayal. GTA: San Andreas is the 3rd  instalment of its kind and the 5th in turn within the franchise (excluding the special editions of the titles of that time).Lots of vehicles to use, lots of guns to choose, lots of characters to meet, lots of places to explore, lots of easter eggs to find, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of side quest missions and achievements to accomplish. A game easy capable to stay playable for a ton of extra hours after finishing the main story.And even after all that said, with the game supporting mods and with millions of those out there to be downloaded and tried, the amount of extra playtime that can be spent in this game even today is insane.Its like the Elder Scrolls of its genre. There are noticable cons in this edition to be fair. Some crashes here and there and very few but hard to miss bugs, but they didn't take away from the tons of fun i had. Also some missions, taking their length and places under consideration, could use a checkpoint mechanism (though you can still manage them after a few tries at worst).Totally and fully recommended.

												i like playing GTA games but this just bad first the control does not work sometime espacially on the camera movement making it hard to turn or shoot.Secondly the physics in this sucks.For example i pickup a crate i was glitch in and out of the wall somehow and died.Then for the cars it shake for no reason.Police literally died in a U shape when in water.Swimming in water look like going around 3km/h even with freestyle and in some cases i swim on land when i am beside the river.Plus the collision detection is very bad why becauase the car hit the lightpost even when there is like a space there and once hit the car spin around making me lose the race sometime.There are many more bugs i haven said it yet cause too many to type in but what i hope is rockstar fix at least the controls and car physics.I did not bought this game i got it when i pre-order GTA V.But those who planning to get it dont buy it			"

												This is still the best violent sandbox game ever. It's cool playing this and observing all the wicked cool a­ss s­hit and good game mechanics and thinking to yourself, ""yep, they screwed that up in IV. Yep, they forgot about that in IV. Mmm-hmm, they didn't include that in IV"". For variety you can occasionally get a tiny bit frustrated and go ""now this is something they did a lot more of in IV"" or do something tedious and Un Fun and think, ""hmm, now this is an element they paid a lot of focus to in IV"" or drive a s­hitty car and go ""hey, now this is the kind of handling and speed that IV is all about"".GTA IV is probably the worst game ever, simply for the crime of coming after this one and being completely, completely inferior in every way, shape and form. Bigger disappointment than Duke Nukem Forever.			"

												I grew up with this game and I am inlove with this game. The negatives in this game are that the options menu isn't as great as vice city's. In this game you play as CJ (Carl Johnson). Our friendo CJ has been kicked out of the state of san andreas to Liberty City. CJ tries to live a normal life there. One day CJ gets a call from his brother Sweet then he finds out his mom died so he returns to San Andreas. CJ is soon held up by Officers which he all ready knows and is blamed for the murder of an officer. The Officers take CJ's cash and drop him into ballas turf (your rival gang). From then on you take control of CJ and help Grove st. (your gang) get back on its feet. The story in this game is brilliant. It will make you think twice about your friendships as some of the people you grow to love will turn your back on you and the people you hate might become your friends. This game tried to add RPG elements which worked well although I didn't like that you have to go to the gym to get muscle otherwise you become weak. There is a stat for eveything in this game. There is a stat for every gun, A stat for your breath, A stat fo you muscle, a stat for your stamina, a stat for driving, a stat for bikes and more which will keep you playing the game to max them all up (appart from fat, unless you want a heart attack.) And you will soon learn that money is something that you don't want to spend as you will not get it back quickly (unless you do the fire truck missions which give you $30,000 each 12 levels of fire trucking.) The better you get at certain things you might get certain buffs, like having the ability to dual wield shot guns. In this game you can gain turf for grove street which will make the streets a safer place for you. To gain turf you must kill 3 gang memebers on that turf then you will start a gang war which will send waves of gangsters at you. You can make this easier by bringing more grove memebers with you. Once you have killed the members of this turf grove members will spawn here and you will gain income from this turf. Like in vice city you can buy buisnesses and do missions for your buissnes helping you gain cash from it. This game is probably my second or third faviourte gta game and I love it. This game gets a positive from me!			"

												i'd only recommend this if you're going to downgrade the game first. Rockstar ""updated"" the game and removed a bunch of songs as well as getting rid of resolution settings, so if you want to truly enjoy this, downgrade it so you can use mods, map modifications, character models, script mods, etc. basically, doing all of the above will allow you to enjoy the ACTUAL GAME THE WAY IT WAS MEANT TO BE PLAYED!

												Game crashes when you are messing with the files.Its a great game but....Rockstar needs to make it the following happen.1 and formost It needs achievements and Cards for this game. No ifs ands and butts.2. It needs to have a Steam Workshop embedded into this game. Should be simple to do right? I mean its kinda a pain in the **** to try a mod this with higher graphical detail then its current Steam version has.3.Fix all the known problems that causes the game to glitch and crash on play. Needs to be fixed up but at the same time let it be more Mod friendly to streamline all the mods. And I mean all of them in the GTA community no matter how Suggestive they may be. Its a 18+ game is it not? Make it one.4. Aside from the top things I said before. Please allow RockStar Official Servers into making Multiplayer for this game. It would be outragous and fun at the same time. Oh but disable the MP Codes kay?If Rockstar can do all this and update it to a point where its previous version can allow modding to it. Do it and make it so. Because I can't afford redownloading this game again on my Satellite. As well as the many mods that are needed for its Prime version.			"

												GTA San Andreas is a great game but this steam PC port is terrible. Firstly, if you want a good San Andreas vanilla experience, I'd reccomend the Xbox 360, PS3 and mobile remastered editions as the game is more clear, more detailed and less clunky. If you are getting it on PC for mods, DO NOT get the steam version. This version disables mods. If you do want mods you'll need to go on dodgy virus prone websites to download illegal pirated files from the non steam version of the game in order to use mods. Most of these downloads to it have been taken down. If you want GTA San Andreas on PC, then get the non-steam version. I requested for a refund and got my money back.			"

												Grand Theft Auto: San AndreasThis game is one of the greatest Grand Theft Autos to date, coming in at a close second behind the recent Grand Theft Auto V.Positives:+ A gripping story of street life and living in the Hoods, you play as Carl Johnson, grove street gang member. The plotline follows him and his homies Ryder, Big Smoke and Sweet, throughout the country, desert and 3 cities. There are lots of blockbuster main missions and side tasks to complete, along with girlfriends to date (who provide some very useful abilities). Drive-bys, vehicle stunts, plane hijacking and flying, stealth, shooting, gang wars - you name it this game has it!+ Gigantic selection of weapons, with RPG elements of leveling - the more you utilise a gun, the more accustomed you become to it, improving accuracy and damage, or even unlocking dual wielding for pistols, uzi's, tec-9s and more. To add to this, you can build muscle at the gym for more melee damage, or eat till you're obese at fast food restaurants. There is a nice chunk of customisation in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, with plenty of clothes, hats, jewellery and other accessories to personalise your character. + Around 30 hours content for the singleplayer story, although there is definitely more for first time players, with many hidden collectibles to find.       + Incredible assortment of radio station music, even the country channels are good.Mixed:~ The graphics are old and it definitely shows, but it shouldn't detract too much from the enjoyment. They are what you would expect from a game released in 2004. Negatives:- None!Overall Score: 9.5/10Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is one of my fondest childhood memories. Truly an infallible game for its time and well worth picking up.			"

												So. GTA San Andreas, my childhood. This game is like GTA 5's big papa. It's like Straight Outta Compton in video game form. I remember always asking my brother if i could play this on his Xbox, and when i got to play, i played ALOT. When i had freinds and relatives over i'd play split screen.Enough with the nostalgic review and on to the real one.Short about the story: In GTA SA you play as Carl Johnsson (CJ) who ""after 5 years on the east coast"" comes home to his brothers in Groove street, but things have changed since he was last there and he now finds himself in a city full of street gangs and criminals and must get himself to fit in again.Gameplay: Gameplay is overall pretty good, can get a bit clunky at moments and the game has a few bugs.Map: The game is set in an completely open world based off of Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and San Fransisco. You start of in Los Santos but to get to the other cities of the map you have to complete main story missions.Characters: The game has some really intersting characters, some even based off of real people like Eazy E. Voice acting is great.Side missions and minigames: After you've beat the game there are still tons of things to do, like purchasing properties and apartements, a few minigames and sidemissions. And still after you've done all that you can mess around with cheat codes.The game is not the same as you remember it if you played it a few years back, recently they released a patch that removed a few songs and broke saves wich you might have guessed caused the fans and community to outrage, but it was copyright issues so what could they do. If you wan't the ""FULL"" game i recommend buying a physical copy online or at a local game store.I'd give this game a solid 8.5, would be a 10 if they didn't release that god forsaken patch.Sorry if the review felt lacking, but it's my first atempt to a serious review and i hope it helped someone.

												Grand Theft Auto: San AnderasExiste cara nova na cidade. Carl Johnson - ou CJ para os outros membros da gangue - é o mais novo membro da família mafiosa de ""Grand Theft Auto"". Aliás, cidade não é o termo correto - San Andreas, diferentemente de Liberty City e Vice City, é um estado e esse salto é uma boa analogia para compreender a escala da mudança na mais nova obra-prima da Rockstar.Assim como ""Grand Theft Auto III"" explorou o mundo de ""O Poderoso Chefão"" e ""Vice City"" revisitou a história de ""Scarface"", ""San Andreas"" não esconde sua inspiração nos filmes que retrataram a violenta situação das brigas de gangues na Califórnia dos anos 90. Surpreendentemente, CJ é provavelmente o mais honesto de todos os protagonistas da série: depois de passar cinco anos trabalhando em Liberty City, ele volta para Los Santos (inspirada em Los Angeles) para o enterro de sua mãe - e encontra os habitantes do bairro sofrendo nas mãos de outras gangues. A sua prioridade é, antes de mais nada, defender as famílias de Orange Grove, o que nem sempre é feito da maneira mais pacífica e educada possível.			"

												So GTA San Andres is the real deal I think...I modded and played this game a lot, and I could not stop with this game.It is not really a role play game but still, it has sooo many options and so many small games in the game what keeps this game fun all along...I always wished for a SA multiplayer so I can play it with my bro and surprise we met with the unoffical SA multyplayer what was pure awesomeness and none of the other gta games dont have that kind of multiplayer what GTA really deserves.Too bad that the better SA servers dead or the servers has legal healt and cheatlike commands what you can just put on a hotkey and you have infinite healt.... :/San Andreas multiplayer was one of my best gaming moments and me and my friends are still talk about it as a good memory.GTA San Andreas was the last GTA what could give you back that real GTA feeling I think..., GTA 4 and 5 are just not the same anymore...Maybe I feel like this cuz the older GTA games were placed in the 80's and 90's and cuz of this you felt like you are a 80's mob or a 90's gangsta :D and this gave you that oldies feeling, and GTA 3 well...., its awesome cuz its GTA 3 lolCant wait for the GTA 5 pc version tho, it was pretty good on xbox!

												Bored waiting for GTA V coming to PC? (if it even will). Buy this. Best game in the series apart from V. IV is good as well, but apart from better graphics it just doesn't have the variety of landscapes, characters, and missions that this game does. Plus, the soundtrack is awesome and IV's sucked. 100/10.			"

												Possibly the best entry in the GTA series, if not the best game released by Rockstar full stop. I remember playing this game sooooooo much on PS2 in the mid 2000's and even in the world of HD it still hasn't lost it's charm. + Great storyline which you can easily get immersed in and keeps you entertained for many hours.+ Magnitude of minigames and submissions as well as Easter eggs which keep you entertained along side the story line.+ Huge map with plenty to explore.+ Many different cars/planes/boat which match the part of the map you are exploring.+ Lots of weapons each with a unique feel.+ Challenging police/army especially at 5-6 stars.+ Moves away from the awkward aiming seen in GTA 3 and GTA Vice City.+ Plenty of mods to enhance the game, although I personally like to play it how it was on PS2.+ The multiplayer online mods are probably better than GTA Online (but that's not really saying much)+ Runs really well on PC, unlike the other GTA console ports (ie GTA IV which runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥even on a beast)+ Gang wars, drive-bys and territorial conflicts are so much fun, these features are missed dearly in GTA V. + The soundtrack/radio is fantastic. Easily the best radio of the GTA series. + Kill people with d!ldos.- Graphics are certainly dated; although still maintain their charm and are certain to bring nostalgia.- The controls if using keyboard/mouse are a bit awkward at first and some controls will need rebinding.- Expect some glitches and game crashes.If you have never played this game before, you really are missing out. This is a game which everyone should experience before they die. I was a bit reluctant to pick it up on PC after such a long time as so many games feel dated and just not quite the same - but not GTA:SA. It retains it's charm and is still a great playthrough in 2016 - imo so much better than GTA V storyline and general gameplay.			"

First the map is so intresting it has that nice classic feeling to it and your not going to find a military base with a jetpack in gta 5 are you. Second the custominzation is great although some cars should have been able to have more upgrades. Another great thing is the police chases are awesome and the police are fun to mess with and the dark humor in the police chases is funny an example being ""I dont want a nighstick up my♥♥♥♥♥ One of the few things wrong with this game is some of the houses look similar score 9 out of 10			"

												Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a great game itself, it's my favorite Grand Theft Auto after Vice City.Having played Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas version 1.0, I must say, the 3.0 (Steam Version) is real bad.Sex scenes are censored, well yeah, I don't care about seeing pixels fu**ing themselves, it's just a game so why removing it then? If a kid wants to masturbate to it then that's his problem.The mods, oh damn, that. You know how Rockstar hate mods? Well, they do hate mods, the 3.0 (Steam version) should not be played with mods so you'll have to downgrade to 1.0.The mobile ""HD"" textures, oh man, please, It's ugly, it's hurting my eyes, 80's and 90's games had better graphics for Christ's sake, what the heck is that, a downgrade? So you're telling me, that I have to downgrade the game to ""upgrade"" it? That doesn't make sense at all, come on Rockstar.Oh and they removed some songs from the radio, I must say, I mostly use the custom radio but the music was pretty good in San Andreas (unlike GTA V) so why not listening to it? But hey wait, they removed some songs.The same crap happened with Vice City before, we paid for that game so we paid for that music too so can't you not be a bunch of pathetic ******* and let us keep our stuff?Damn developers these days I swear.The game itself on version 1.0 deserves 9/10 but after all what they did to it it deserve a 3/10.The game is uglier, songs were removed from the game even for those who bought the game way before, mods are unplayable on this version and there are many other problems.I'm still recommending this game because you can always downgrade it to an older version if you want so that's that.

												Not only is this my favorite GTA game, but it's also one of my favorite games of all time. It's so unbelievably fun to play, and it's all around filled with great content and things that give it a surprising amount of replayability. The game is more complex than other GTA games in a few ways, like the fact that you can build muscle/gain fat/level up certain skills. It also has the same typical GTA charm where you can just cause destruction on massive scales.Best GTA, pretty good port.			"

On this negative side of this game it has some very difficult missions which I have broken several of my mouses on.

												I'm for now setting my review to negative. I dont think it is right to remove lots of features during an update without bringing in new updates.  Sure, they might be legally allowed to but a lot of people are displeased with it. I've heard things about a secret update and I certainly hope that is happening, because that'll make me recommend the game again. For now there's one recommendation which is to pirate it. At the moment pirates simply have more features than people who paid for the game.On top of that GTA SA keeps crashing constantly now when entering a vehicle because of Rockstar not even removing the radio stations properly. #f*ckrockstar			"

You are wrong. GTA SA has amazing physics minus the occasional glitch. Also For the time the graphics are outstanding and are considered to still be okay. (To my standards) Now i might have said the map was small but it is not at all! the map is huge! but not as huge as GTA v. Basically, if you modded the graphics on GTA SA and mabe the physics. you would have GTA V.8.9/10			"

												Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was a pinnacle of the gaming scene back in 2004. The game had so many more possibilities compared to the previous two 3D universe games, and is a fun experience. A disclaimer to note is that before you play, I would suggest downgrading your game to version 1.0, so you can actually mod the game and get back some graphical features which were oddly removed. Overall, stellar game, and would definately recommend this to people looking for a GTA game that they can run.			"

												Many people find it hard to enjoy this game or even start it up anymore because of various issues arising on newer hardware. If you are one of these people then the modding community is back again to save the day! There are various patches on the internet that fix many problems with the PC version of GTA San Andreas. I've taken the time find all the links to them and make them available here in this review. Please rate it so other people can see it!Steam to V1.0 Downgrader:(Undos the newest update and adds back the content that Rockstar removed, and makes the game moddable)~ http://gtaforums.com/topic/753764-steam-downgrader/All in one ZIP which includes: (All these files just need a simple copy and paste to GTA SA's directory)-Silent's ASI Loader (Needed for almost everything below to work)-Silent's Patch (Fixes various issues such as the 25 fps lock, Mouse locking up ingame, adds missing visual effects, etc)-Widescreen Fix (Corrects the size and position of the HUD to fit in with modern 16:9 screens)-PS2 GFX (Adds the PS2's reflections, grass, sky effects, and much more back to the PC version)-GInput (Adds support for modern Xbox and Playstation brand controllers)-ENBSeries (Quick config i made to make the shadows look softer / darker, there's barely a difference in performance)~ https://mega.co.nz/#!wlMxQSqK!5oq68wZvRnrbq7BnwFUrlh6hf2kH4IBBvkEPShPAyBYLast but not least, you wouldnt fully expereince GTA San Andreas on PC without a online multiplayer mod! ~ Multi Theft Auto:  http://www.multitheftauto.com/ "

												Everyone seems to be giving the Steam version of this game bad reviews because of the few missing songs and resolution support loss, but as retail copies are fairly hard to come by nowadays, this is still a great way to experience Rockstar's classic game. Don't be scared away by the negative reviews; San Andreas is as good as it always has been. However, $15 seems kinda pricey for a game this old, so I'd wait for it to go on sale. (I got this bundled with III and Vice City for $6)			"

												For me, this is one of the best, if not the best, game of all time. San Andreas is packed with content and even today i find it a blast to play. It doesn't have the setting or the music that made Vice City so iconic, but everything else is greatly improved. The map is huge and diversified, with 3 distinct cities, countryside and desert. There's tons of vehicles. The RPG elements aren't overused. The shooting mechanics are more fluid. The story has it's flaws, but it's well written, and there's plenty of great characters, even with some cameos. The soundtrack is also great. The missions are well designed and varied. There's plenty of side content, although some of it is boring. The list goes on and on. Almost everything you could do in GTA III or Vice City, you can do it better here. For me, this is the definitive sandbox experience. And i'm not even talking about all the mods that you can get, which increases the replayability and fun that you can have. No game is perfect, but this one gets very close to that, especially when it came out. Just get it.To have the best possible experience you'll need to tweak the game a bit, with some essential mods.1- You'll need to downgrade the game to it's 1.0 version to be able to mod it.2- Install a .asi loader to allow mods to be loaded.3- The most important thing is the SilentPatch, fixing many bugs and issues and also raises the FPS from 25 to 30.4- Widescreen Fix if you're playing on a widescreen.5- GInput, if you wanna play with a controller.There's also plenty of other options, but i think these are the essential ones that everyone should install to the base game.

												Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a ""sandbox/openworld crime simulator"" as some people have dubbed the genre. In this game, you take on the role of Carl Johnson (aka CJ for short), a man who recently came back to San Andreas from Liberty City after his mother was killed in a driveby shooting. During the course of the game, CJ will have to earn money and respect by doing tasks and missions for others. Now that the summary's out of the way, let's get onto the game itself. The PC port isn't as good as the PS2 port in terms of features. For some reason a lot of features were left out in the PC port. Even at version 3.0, the game still lacks things the original PS2 version has. Most notably, car sheen is missing from most of the cars. Some sound effects, such as when you invite hookers into a car, are also missing (the moaning sounds mostly). The moon and night skies are also less detailed and varied. In addition, a few cheats don't exist in the PC version (such as ""drive on water"" and ""hookers pay you"".)Another unfortunate issue is that you can't mod version 3.0 or 2.0 (which is technically 3.0 but without steam support.). This was done because of a controversy a few years back. Thankfully, you can downgrade the game to either 1.01 or 1.0 with a downgrader program. (google it)  Despite some saying it's illegal, Valve hasn't removed forum posts from the Steam forums which means they probably don't care. (they're heavy supporters of modding as you probably know. And removing something like that wouldn't be good for their userbase or their business.)The PC version also boasts a special radio station for players to play their own music. You'll usually find it in your ""My Documents"" folder in a folder under the name ""GTA user files"" Another feature that uses this folder is the camera. Take a picture and it saves here.Gameplaywise, the game plays pretty well and it's just as fun as the PS2 version, regardless of problems. Most if not all of CJ's dialog is there. At first, being used to playing GTA IV, I was a little confused about how the wanted level system worked.  But after a while I figured it out. The weapons are responsive and the controls are fluent. Even the hand-to-hand works well. The pedestrian AI is very good for such an old game. They'll do things from conversing with eachother (though sometimes the conversations make absolutely no sense) to fighting eachother and getting into police chases. they'll even ram you until your car explodes if you hit theirs (such as the stupid Taxi drivers) That being said, it's not without flaws. The plane AI is simplistic and will often wreak for no reason. This is because the planes were only programmed to fly over the player's head in a straight line, which often results in them colliding with high objects like skyscrapers and mountains. The resulting explosion can injure or even kill CJ if he's too close too.Graphically, the game is dated by today's standards. This can easily be seen on character models. While the lips move, the individual fingers on the hands don't, which results in a "" classic Resident Evil esque"" cutscene where characters point with their whole hand. Some cars also lack detail, such as the ZR-350 which just looks like it was textured in MS paint. Thankfully, there are mods out there that can help the game look nicer so it's not a total loss. (most will require you to downgrade to 1.0 or 1.01 to actually use though unless they use the 2.0/3.0 installation method.) It's also not as impressive as the PS2 version graphically due to the lack of detail on some cars mentioned above and the moon thing mentioned earlier. It can go higher res than the PS2 version, so that is at least somewhat a redeeming quality.Sound. As stated earlier, some sounds are missing. However, most if not all the typical dialog and sound effects are there. CJ will yell at pedestrians and police if they attack him or get in his way. What he says depends upon how expensive the clothing he's wearing is and how much money he has. The game features a voice acting cast including favorites like Samuel L. Jackson (Officer Frank Tenpenny.) As with most GTA games, the music doesn't play unless you're driving. The variety of stations ranges from R&B, hardcore rap, to even rock and country. The User Track player function mentioned above allows you to customize your own station. The Radio commercials and talk shows are just as enjoyable as well. With many humorus parody commercials and talk shows with the nonsense and humor that the GTA series' radio channels are known for.Overall: 9/10. The PC port has its flaws but it's well worth the 14.99 price tag here on steam. Buy it if you want it. Though if you want to mod, it would probably be easier on you to buy the original version of the PC version (version 1.0) off of ebay than downgrading steam's version 3.0.			"

GameplayI really like this game. There's so much stuff to do and even still I'm discovering new things. The main story and the characters are well written according to traditional standards. I've seen people complain that it's sort of unforgiving since you have to redo the whole mission if you die, but if you're having lots of trouble, try doing some side activities. Along with some rewards, you learn the geography of the city which at least makes me feel a lot more attached to the virtual location.There are also lots of cars and weapons to drive aroung and the RPG stats. At first I felt like they didn't change much, but I can definitely feel a difference between the max driving and minimal driving skill. The portThe game is locked to 25fps. You can turn off the frame limiter in the options, but because parts of the game use the framerate to time the scripts that make the game function, things go either slowmo or too fast. Vice City has similar problems, but as an example the fountains in the game emit more particles when the framelimiter is turned off, which seems to indicate that the timing on the emitter is using the framerate instead of x per second/minute or other measures.It does have gamepad support. If you want to play with the mouse and keyboard, there might be issues with the mouse suddenly not working. This can be fixed by downloading a file called ""DINPUT8.DLL"" and putting it in your San Andreas folder where the .exe is.You may also come across a bug where the game crashes instantly after an explosion happens. This can be fixed by running the game in Windows XP Service Pack 3 compatibility mode.			"

												For me, this is one of the best, if not the best, game of all time. San Andreas is packed with content and even today i find it a blast to play. It doesn't have the setting or the music that made Vice City so iconic, but everything else is greatly improved. The map is huge and diversified, with 3 distinct cities, countryside and desert. There's tons of vehicles. The RPG elements aren't overused. The shooting mechanics are more fluid. The story has it's flaws, but it's well written, and there's plenty of great characters, even with some cameos. The soundtrack is also great. The missions are well designed and varied. There's plenty of side content, although some of it is boring. The list goes on and on. Almost everything you could do in GTA III or Vice City, you can do it better here. For me, this is the definitive sandbox experience. And i'm not even talking about all the mods that you can get, which increases the replayability and fun that you can have. No game is perfect, but this one gets very close to that, especially when it came out. Just get it.To have the best possible experience you'll need to tweak the game a bit, with some essential mods.1- You'll need to downgrade the game to it's 1.0 version to be able to mod it.2- Install a .asi loader to allow mods to be loaded.3- The most important thing is the SilentPatch, fixing many bugs and issues and also raises the FPS from 25 to 30.4- Widescreen Fix if you're playing on a widescreen.5- GInput, if you wanna play with a controller.There's also plenty of other options, but i think these are the essential ones that everyone should install to the base game.

												Grand Theft Auto: San AnderasExiste cara nova na cidade. Carl Johnson - ou CJ para os outros membros da gangue - é o mais novo membro da família mafiosa de ""Grand Theft Auto"". Aliás, cidade não é o termo correto - San Andreas, diferentemente de Liberty City e Vice City, é um estado e esse salto é uma boa analogia para compreender a escala da mudança na mais nova obra-prima da Rockstar.Assim como ""Grand Theft Auto III"" explorou o mundo de ""O Poderoso Chefão"" e ""Vice City"" revisitou a história de ""Scarface"", ""San Andreas"" não esconde sua inspiração nos filmes que retrataram a violenta situação das brigas de gangues na Califórnia dos anos 90. Surpreendentemente, CJ é provavelmente o mais honesto de todos os protagonistas da série: depois de passar cinco anos trabalhando em Liberty City, ele volta para Los Santos (inspirada em Los Angeles) para o enterro de sua mãe - e encontra os habitantes do bairro sofrendo nas mãos de outras gangues. A sua prioridade é, antes de mais nada, defender as famílias de Orange Grove, o que nem sempre é feito da maneira mais pacífica e educada possível.			"

												There is not much else left to be said about Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.  It is one of the greatest games ever made and it pretty much left us all speechless when it came out. It's funny how after SO many years, I can easily remember the map and even where all the hidden items and guns were located. Countless hours, countless mods and all the countless stories we made up as we were playing this game as kids... That's something hard to forget. The map feels huge, the music is amazing and the gameplay is great. All the customization, minigames, hidden items, vehicles, landscapes, the driving schools, the war gangs... There are just too many things this game does right. After playing it recently, the missions and races that I found almost impossible are a piece of cake now. Nevertheless, they are still a lot of fun. As for how the game looks, yeah, well, it does look kind of old now (the game was released in 2004!) but a few texture packs here, an enb there and a mod here, and you've got yourself a beautiful looking game. Regarding the recent patch... Yeah, it sucks, but I wouldn't personally punish the game rating it bad as everyone seems to be doing. I wouldn't want anyone missing this game just because of the patch. Just use a downgrader to get it back to 1.0 and there you go! All the amazing songs that used to be in the original game are back and you can add a few extra mods. Takes less than 10 minutes. Enjoy your stay in San Andreas!			"

												In a way I wish I could have the ability to share the incredible experiences that I had while playing this game with this review.I sadly don't think i'm that aware of myself, nor am I familiar with my ability to express myself purely, and completely, honestly.I can only say that Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is in a lot of ways the ""epithome"" of not only the Grand Theft Auto series, but in my opinion, of open world games.This is the formula that Rockstar created, refined and polished to perfection, and while the game might have technically some issues that range from minor, to abysmal, I don't think anyone can deny that this game, at the very least, has had a significant impact in their lifes, in one way or the other.This is a game that is beloved by people that played it way back when it originally released, up until newcomers to the series that are simply curious about the legacy of this game.The story it's excellent, the characters, the missions, the complete an utter range of jokes, ideas, concepts, and experiences that are packed with detail in your journey are merely the fragments of what this game holds. In it's attention for developing an enjoyable experience, and a heartfelt one at that, Rockstar turned the flaws of their games in benefits and values, that are shared perfectly with this example of a game.Even when everything in the game feels dated, old, and mechanically flawed, objectively flawed (whatever that means) the game somehow manages to revert difficult and often hateful missions into pieces that conform something bigger, something memorable.Even after years from the game's release you can see that people still share their memories trying to beat missions like ""Wrong Side of the Tracks"" a mission that is not only difficult thanks to the ""tight"" controls over your vehicle, but also because of the dependency of the game's a.i.Altho as much as I can praise the game's story, the game's incidental experiences that you can get sometimes by simply driving around listening to the incredible selection of songs that are available in the game's radio.There's a significant problem with the game's pc version.For starters, the game is missing a lot of content from the consoles versions of the game, cars, effects, enviroments, textures, etc... There's a lot here that conforms an incredible atmosphere and enhances what is already an excellent game, that's simply missing, with the only ability of instaurating this ""features"" with the use of mods, thanks to the incredible, and still active community that still keeps itself passionate even after 12 years from the games release.As I said, a true testament of the legacy of this incredible game.However if it wasn't only the missing content there are other issues, the game has problems running at framerates higher than 60 framerates per second, while there are other people that debate the game also has problems while even surpassing 30 framerates per second, either way it's something that I haven't personally experience in my time with the game, that as you may see from the Steam's recorded time, it's not much.This is simply because I have had to ""downgrade"" my game's version from 3.0 to 1.0, the first, and most compatible version with the modifications created by the community now a days.It's been the only wat that i've found myself actually enjoying the game, (as much as I resent the phrase) that the developers intended for me to play.If that wasn't enough, new versions also eliminate certain songs from the different fictitious radio stations in-game. Something that as I said I haven't experienced thanks to the ability to downgrade and mantain the original first game's released version intact by also having to, sadly, move the game away from Steam's game directory.At it's core, I love this game, I have incredible memories with it, and I think it's a game that you owe yourself to play, if you love games, and certainly, if you love Gta, this is a game that in my opinion deserves all the praise and remembrance that it gets even now a days, it's a game that can have frustating missions, repetitive ones at that, other times it can be sad, but for the most part I don't think anyone can't deny the game it's a fun and entretaining time to experience through and through.This in a lot of ways is also the last Grand Theft Auto game released for the Sixth generation of consoles, and similarly to how in a way Grand Theft Auto 5 was that for the Playstation 3, and the Xbox 360, even while they re-release that game for newer platforms, including pc, this is a firm, a departure and a letter of love from Rockstar games towards its fans.The gameplay, the characters, the different places and diverse cities that you encounter while exploring the map, the small fragment of time that the leaved since this game up until Grand Theft Auto 4, was enough for people to show there love as well, sharing experiences, creating mods, and even stories that end up becoming part of videogame's culture.Grand Theft Auto San Andreas it's essentially the definition of what, in my opinion, a great game can be, a great game not only in sales, nor in scores, but in heart, and in memories.That's the true definition of a successful game for me, a game that 12 years after release people still talk about, still get involved with, both by playing it, as well as in by creating features for the game.I just wish in a way that ""love"" had also been shared at it's fullest with the pc version of the game, altho after all this years, I frankly can say that I just don't care...Mainly with all the mods that are out there.

												Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a ""sandbox/openworld crime simulator"" as some people have dubbed the genre. In this game, you take on the role of Carl Johnson (aka CJ for short), a man who recently came back to San Andreas from Liberty City after his mother was killed in a driveby shooting. During the course of the game, CJ will have to earn money and respect by doing tasks and missions for others. Now that the summary's out of the way, let's get onto the game itself. The PC port isn't as good as the PS2 port in terms of features. For some reason a lot of features were left out in the PC port. Even at version 3.0, the game still lacks things the original PS2 version has. Most notably, car sheen is missing from most of the cars. Some sound effects, such as when you invite hookers into a car, are also missing (the moaning sounds mostly). The moon and night skies are also less detailed and varied. In addition, a few cheats don't exist in the PC version (such as ""drive on water"" and ""hookers pay you"".)Another unfortunate issue is that you can't mod version 3.0 or 2.0 (which is technically 3.0 but without steam support.). This was done because of a controversy a few years back. Thankfully, you can downgrade the game to either 1.01 or 1.0 with a downgrader program. (google it)  Despite some saying it's illegal, Valve hasn't removed forum posts from the Steam forums which means they probably don't care. (they're heavy supporters of modding as you probably know. And removing something like that wouldn't be good for their userbase or their business.)The PC version also boasts a special radio station for players to play their own music. You'll usually find it in your ""My Documents"" folder in a folder under the name ""GTA user files"" Another feature that uses this folder is the camera. Take a picture and it saves here.Gameplaywise, the game plays pretty well and it's just as fun as the PS2 version, regardless of problems. Most if not all of CJ's dialog is there. At first, being used to playing GTA IV, I was a little confused about how the wanted level system worked.  But after a while I figured it out. The weapons are responsive and the controls are fluent. Even the hand-to-hand works well. The pedestrian AI is very good for such an old game. They'll do things from conversing with eachother (though sometimes the conversations make absolutely no sense) to fighting eachother and getting into police chases. they'll even ram you until your car explodes if you hit theirs (such as the stupid Taxi drivers) That being said, it's not without flaws. The plane AI is simplistic and will often wreak for no reason. This is because the planes were only programmed to fly over the player's head in a straight line, which often results in them colliding with high objects like skyscrapers and mountains. The resulting explosion can injure or even kill CJ if he's too close too.Graphically, the game is dated by today's standards. This can easily be seen on character models. While the lips move, the individual fingers on the hands don't, which results in a "" classic Resident Evil esque"" cutscene where characters point with their whole hand. Some cars also lack detail, such as the ZR-350 which just looks like it was textured in MS paint. Thankfully, there are mods out there that can help the game look nicer so it's not a total loss. (most will require you to downgrade to 1.0 or 1.01 to actually use though unless they use the 2.0/3.0 installation method.) It's also not as impressive as the PS2 version graphically due to the lack of detail on some cars mentioned above and the moon thing mentioned earlier. It can go higher res than the PS2 version, so that is at least somewhat a redeeming quality.Sound. As stated earlier, some sounds are missing. However, most if not all the typical dialog and sound effects are there. CJ will yell at pedestrians and police if they attack him or get in his way. What he says depends upon how expensive the clothing he's wearing is and how much money he has. The game features a voice acting cast including favorites like Samuel L. Jackson (Officer Frank Tenpenny.) As with most GTA games, the music doesn't play unless you're driving. The variety of stations ranges from R&B, hardcore rap, to even rock and country. The User Track player function mentioned above allows you to customize your own station. The Radio commercials and talk shows are just as enjoyable as well. With many humorus parody commercials and talk shows with the nonsense and humor that the GTA series' radio channels are known for.Overall: 9/10. The PC port has its flaws but it's well worth the 14.99 price tag here on steam. Buy it if you want it. Though if you want to mod, it would probably be easier on you to buy the original version of the PC version (version 1.0) off of ebay than downgrading steam's version 3.0.			"

												I am not really a huge fan of GTA, even though I have thoroughly played a lot of them. With San Andreas, however, I have to say I unexpectedly enjoyed it a lot. The characters are definitely the highlight. They -- especially the main character -- grow and change, which is crucial to good storytelling. They range from ambitious underdog gangster to oblivious hippie to blind Asian casino owner to nerdy RC enthusiast to corrupt policeman villain voiced by Samuel L Jackson. The story branches off into unexpected turns, and does it with flair. Even the final mission proved to be more thought-provoking than I thought, for the villain who was once the protagonist's best friend ends up destroying himself by living it up at the top and betraying those who trust him. Isn't this what the protagonist does as well? Moreover, while many missions prove to be a bit frustrating, they still provide a good challenge, and you can still strategize a bit. Buying properties is almost a joke since you'll spend way more money on other properties that basically let you do the same thing: save and change your clothes. I have yet to thoroughly play IV and V, but this is by far my favorite GTA game so far in terms of story.			"

I saw many people complaining about the removal of mods, etc. For me, I quite enjoy the game without mods, and I really enjoy the gameplay.

Follow the damn train.The gameplay is good, music is eh (you can put your own playlist in this game and listen to it thru an ingame radio station, also Vice City has the best soundtrack).

												While the PC port does need some tweaking to get things running smoothly, It shouldn't discount the fact San Andreas is an amazing game. Sure in some areas it hasn't aged all to well but to put it in perspective, San Andreas was the GTA V of the PS2 era. The story is also pretty good in my opinion, Unlike GTA III and Vice City's more mafia-esq stories, San Andreas put's you in the role of one of the most beloved gangbangers Carl Johnson. After returning from Liberty City, Carl is reunited with old friends and enemies as he tries to get revenge on the people responsible for the death of his mother in a drive-by shooting. With 100 story missions traveling across the entire state of San Andreas, There's no doubt it'll keep you busy for quite some time. The soundtrack is great too, Sure the Steam version is lacking some of the songs from the original release, Granted it isn't really Rockstar's fault licensing ran out, It's still a bummer. As for issues with San Andreas running smoothly, I suggest getting Silent's Asi loader and Silent's patch. The patch fixes numerous graphical and gameplay bugs such as framelimiter be locked at 25 FPS and various fixing lighting and shader issues. Overall, Give San Andreas as shot, It's fairly cheap and is loaded with all sorts of stuff to do. Also the modding community is incredibly strong still so paying $15 is a fair trade off for what you're getting.			"

												I absoloutly loved this game, with the huge map and all its myths and legends! I think the detail could have been like GTA:5, but that would probably take a while though. But I do reccommend this game, if you want a Grand Theft Auto not too hard or too easy, even though this has like 160 missions!			"

												For me, this is one of the best, if not the best, game of all time. San Andreas is packed with content and even today i find it a blast to play. It doesn't have the setting or the music that made Vice City so iconic, but everything else is greatly improved. The map is huge and diversified, with 3 distinct cities, countryside and desert. There's tons of vehicles. The RPG elements aren't overused. The shooting mechanics are more fluid. The story has it's flaws, but it's well written, and there's plenty of great characters, even with some cameos. The soundtrack is also great. The missions are well designed and varied. There's plenty of side content, although some of it is boring. The list goes on and on. Almost everything you could do in GTA III or Vice City, you can do it better here. For me, this is the definitive sandbox experience. And i'm not even talking about all the mods that you can get, which increases the replayability and fun that you can have. No game is perfect, but this one gets very close to that, especially when it came out. Just get it.To have the best possible experience you'll need to tweak the game a bit, with some essential mods.1- You'll need to downgrade the game to it's 1.0 version to be able to mod it.2- Install a .asi loader to allow mods to be loaded.3- The most important thing is the SilentPatch, fixing many bugs and issues and also raises the FPS from 25 to 30.4- Widescreen Fix if you're playing on a widescreen.5- GInput, if you wanna play with a controller.There's also plenty of other options, but i think these are the essential ones that everyone should install to the base game.

												Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a great game itself, it's my favorite Grand Theft Auto after Vice City.Having played Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas version 1.0, I must say, the 3.0 (Steam Version) is real bad.Sex scenes are censored, well yeah, I don't care about seeing pixels fu**ing themselves, it's just a game so why removing it then? If a kid wants to masturbate to it then that's his problem.The mods, oh damn, that. You know how Rockstar hate mods? Well, they do hate mods, the 3.0 (Steam version) should not be played with mods so you'll have to downgrade to 1.0.The mobile ""HD"" textures, oh man, please, It's ugly, it's hurting my eyes, 80's and 90's games had better graphics for Christ's sake, what the heck is that, a downgrade? So you're telling me, that I have to downgrade the game to ""upgrade"" it? That doesn't make sense at all, come on Rockstar.Oh and they removed some songs from the radio, I must say, I mostly use the custom radio but the music was pretty good in San Andreas (unlike GTA V) so why not listening to it? But hey wait, they removed some songs.The same crap happened with Vice City before, we paid for that game so we paid for that music too so can't you not be a bunch of pathetic ******* and let us keep our stuff?Damn developers these days I swear.The game itself on version 1.0 deserves 9/10 but after all what they did to it it deserve a 3/10.The game is uglier, songs were removed from the game even for those who bought the game way before, mods are unplayable on this version and there are many other problems.I'm still recommending this game because you can always downgrade it to an older version if you want so that's that.

												This is a fantastic game. It started me on the GTA series and I still to this very day think it is easily the best GTA in the series. It has that amazing west coast atmosphere that is rare in video games (and if you like west coast rap, you will love this). The gameplay is very fun and intuitive. The only thing that is wrong with the game is the graphics; yes it is old I know this but it simply hasn't aged very well. In addition to this, the game suffers from extreme screen tearing when it doesn't have the FPS capped but when it is capped it runs at 24FPS and looks poor.But all in all play this game, it's fun and unique with a great story. It has some iffy missions such as the train chasing mission and the RC plane mission but apart from that it is a solid great game. I would recommend you use a controller for this as well since it is indeed hard to drive and fly with a mouse and keyboard.Happy Hustling!			"

												All you have to do, is follow the damn mission markers, CJ.Seriously though it's a good game. I used to have it on disk, but then I lost it.  At any rate, I've found its replay value surpasses all the other GTAs. Or maybe that's my nostalgia talking, I don't know.  I do like the level of customization, from skinny to fat, every type of clothing you want, and  a larger hair selection than GTA V (singleplayer).  The missions can be tough sometimes, but most of them are fun.  Weapons are satisying enough, and I used to spend my time writing down all the cheats.  I still have some memorized, like ""JumpJet"" and ""HESOYAM"".10/10 would waste entire weeks until my laptop melted near the last mission so I lost all my progress and then I didn't play it for years again.

												Many years later, this continues to be my favorite Grand Theft Auto game. The game world (especially at the time) was absolutely massive and spanned 3 (or four depending on how you're counting) different regions with full-sized cities. It has quasi-RPG elements allowing you to alter your appearance based on how you eat and work out, as well as gaining skill in driving. Then there was a massive amount of different missions, side missions, activities, etc. so that it always seemed there was something more to do. I've lost a large chunk of my personal time to this game and I keep coming back to it even now. Can't recommend enough.			"

												Growing up as a white kid in a non-white neighborhood, I got a lot of bikes stolen from me. I would say over the course of my life I've had about 10-12 bikes stolen. This used to make me really sad, but in GTA San Andreas I got to role play stealing a bike from a white kid and riding off into the sunset with it. I had no idea it was so much fun to steal bikes from white kids. Now that GTA taught this to me I'm not sad about all my lost bikes, because I know how much joy stealing them from me brought to other people.			"

												Excellent game, but I advise against buying it via steam, since there were 18 songs removed in the latest update. If you want to relive your childhood memories, go buy a disc version of this game somewhere else, or ""borrow"" it from somewhere wink wink ;). There is also no 1080p support, so you have to get mods in order to get your songs back and fix the resolution.I highly reccomend this game, but I advise against buying it from steam, and therefore I will give this a negative review.

												The 90s were a special time. The International reputation of the USA was more closely aligned with baseball, basketball Disney and a naughty President than the decidedly militaristic and dark cloak it would come to adopt in the coming century. The internet had not made information instantly accessible and the world therefore felt so much larger, so much more varied and unknowable. NWA, gangsta rap in general and various news stories had suggested the dangers of gangland Los Angeles, among other places, but these things were all distant, almost mythological.Poking above the waves in the late 90s however was a series of top-down crime simulation computer games known as GTA which would eventually bring this entire world of crime right to your TV or computer screens. A catchy title, the first two installments (and an expansion or two) had the players navigating a city viewed from above, running their little sprite around shooting people, stealing cars, jumping bridges and delivering bombs. Addictive gameplay was given an edge by a high degree of polish, vaguely black humor, outlandish micro-plots and satisfying - if unrealistic - vehicle gameplay to be enjoyed alongside some hilarious radio channels.When GTA 3 came out at the turn of the century these things were translated more or less directly into a 3D world, meeting with huge success and revolutionising the public concept of exactly how much we would be able to expect from computer games going forward. An entire, full scale city was rendered for us in seamless 3D (a short draw distance not being noticed as there was no real precedent to hold the game up against) Beyond the graphics, the gameplay was every bit as darkly fun and raunchy as it had been in the 2D games, only this time in full 3D with a distinctive visual style - and of course the car driving was still there, satisfying as ever, with those radio stations becomming a core feature of the game - ah, Lazlow.The exceptional expansion GTA Vice City had come and gone - arguably staking a solid claim to being the best game in the entire series with the quantum leaps the game offered in terms of gameplay and, if less noticably, graphics - and before you knew it a new title had been announced: GTA San Andreas.Things were different this time around. Consumer commitment would be tested by a huge change in tone from the white trash east-coast earlier games to a Gangsta Rap-inspired west coast rendition of Los Angeles gang warfare, headlined by an African American protagonist, and radio stations which would be booming out rap classics. Rockstar by now was building a third title for the ageing PS2 system, and the technological bottleneck which meant that the graphics in this game were only separated from Vice City by aesthetic margins - more polygonal detail on cars and most other objects, more vibrant colours, a more evocative set of terrain types - meant that a huge amount of attention was fixed on shoehorning more and more gameplay innovations into the package.Looking back each GTA title released on the PS2 was a quantum leap ahead of previous titles in terms of gameplay. GTA IV would arguably buck this trend - perhaps they ran out of ways to innovate, perhaps the power of the new system was too potent for them to focus on their other obligations - but San Andreas really was a bigger, badder, better game than any previous title. As such this review stands as a solemn assurance: buy this game, and you will be getting extreme value for money, you will be getting the best crime simulation experience that was available to the world for half a decade, you will be getting a bona fide good game. Don't let age fool you, San Andreas is a lush, vibrant, jam-packed world of crime with half-forgotten gameplay tweaks and additions that will out at you out of the shadows of the past and cause huge grins to break out on your face.You play as Carl [Williams? I forget], an African American man returning home from the East Coast to bury his mother and - exactly to what extent this was part of his plans at the outset is unclear - reconnect with his initially grudging former gang bretheren and wrestle control of the San Andreas region from anyone else who might wish to stake some claim to it. Small fish prevail at the start, as a corrupt cop, double-dealing gang member, pathetic music artist hopeful and a few other similar characters have you running the kind of jobs that are best accompanied by NWA or Cypress Hill, but after a highlight of the game has come and gone - an all-out gang war in which you are free to dominate an entire city if you can be bothered - you are ejected out the refuse pipe of the starting city and sent scurrying across the redneck alpine regions between the SA towns, ending up in a different town full of different crooks and continuing on your quest for relevance and power.The game is long, the missions varied and often challenging, the vehicles more varied than ever and great fun. The list of characters is endless, and the gigantic environment offers hours upon hours of entertainment even when it is cordoned off into smaller regions at the start.Buy this game! It is guaranteed to be good value no matter the price, and it is a holdover from a time in gaming when things like the console wars persisted and the idea of single companies like EA or UbiSoft holding sway over vast spans of offered products was, while emryonic, merely background noise to the single-player offerings being offered for the iconic gaming platforms of the day. Of those offerings, GTA: SA is without a doubt in the topmost echelon.			"

												Oh, San Andreas.  Honestly the best GTA ever, with a map and story so large it would take any person a least 30 hours to just run the story.  It has loads of mini-games that actually feel integral to the game, not just tacked on for the sake of content.  It was the first GTA to have a deep vehicle customization, but none of this ""instantly recall your car after you wreck it"" nonsense.  Its not without its flaws, but it is so deep rooted in nostolgia that I can only reccomend this game immensely.Also works well on new systems, runs fine on Windows 7, FX 8350, and a GTX 960.If you don't have it already, do yourself a favor this winter and replay this PS2 masterpiece, you won't regret it.

												I remember 7 year old me walking into a dingy computer room. A washed out sign read above the doorway ""GameZone"", if I recall correctly. It was a tight 6x6 space, a dimming light above several desks, there were maybe 6 or 7 computers. Cigarette smoke rising in the air, flattened coke cans on the floor. Smelly teens with a face full of pimples and grease in their hair, children of all ages, gathered all around the fat CRT monitors, playing Counter Strike 1.6, Diablo II and then there was this game... Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.   For 0.50¢ and hour you could have this game all to yourself. And we didn't even do the missions! We just rode around on motorcycles, sped up in cars and had massive shootouts with the police. And the cheats... Oh, all the glorious cheats! Everyone knew them: HESOYAM, OHDUDE, BUFFMEUP, UZUMYMW... A single kid paid the price, but 10 kids played the game together in harmony. Sharing cheats and showing off hacks and tricks. ""Grove Street. Home..."" ♥			"

												The 90s were a special time. The International reputation of the USA was more closely aligned with baseball, basketball Disney and a naughty President than the decidedly militaristic and dark cloak it would come to adopt in the coming century. The internet had not made information instantly accessible and the world therefore felt so much larger, so much more varied and unknowable. NWA, gangsta rap in general and various news stories had suggested the dangers of gangland Los Angeles, among other places, but these things were all distant, almost mythological.Poking above the waves in the late 90s however was a series of top-down crime simulation computer games known as GTA which would eventually bring this entire world of crime right to your TV or computer screens. A catchy title, the first two installments (and an expansion or two) had the players navigating a city viewed from above, running their little sprite around shooting people, stealing cars, jumping bridges and delivering bombs. Addictive gameplay was given an edge by a high degree of polish, vaguely black humor, outlandish micro-plots and satisfying - if unrealistic - vehicle gameplay to be enjoyed alongside some hilarious radio channels.When GTA 3 came out at the turn of the century these things were translated more or less directly into a 3D world, meeting with huge success and revolutionising the public concept of exactly how much we would be able to expect from computer games going forward. An entire, full scale city was rendered for us in seamless 3D (a short draw distance not being noticed as there was no real precedent to hold the game up against) Beyond the graphics, the gameplay was every bit as darkly fun and raunchy as it had been in the 2D games, only this time in full 3D with a distinctive visual style - and of course the car driving was still there, satisfying as ever, with those radio stations becomming a core feature of the game - ah, Lazlow.The exceptional expansion GTA Vice City had come and gone - arguably staking a solid claim to being the best game in the entire series with the quantum leaps the game offered in terms of gameplay and, if less noticably, graphics - and before you knew it a new title had been announced: GTA San Andreas.Things were different this time around. Consumer commitment would be tested by a huge change in tone from the white trash east-coast earlier games to a Gangsta Rap-inspired west coast rendition of Los Angeles gang warfare, headlined by an African American protagonist, and radio stations which would be booming out rap classics. Rockstar by now was building a third title for the ageing PS2 system, and the technological bottleneck which meant that the graphics in this game were only separated from Vice City by aesthetic margins - more polygonal detail on cars and most other objects, more vibrant colours, a more evocative set of terrain types - meant that a huge amount of attention was fixed on shoehorning more and more gameplay innovations into the package.Looking back each GTA title released on the PS2 was a quantum leap ahead of previous titles in terms of gameplay. GTA IV would arguably buck this trend - perhaps they ran out of ways to innovate, perhaps the power of the new system was too potent for them to focus on their other obligations - but San Andreas really was a bigger, badder, better game than any previous title. As such this review stands as a solemn assurance: buy this game, and you will be getting extreme value for money, you will be getting the best crime simulation experience that was available to the world for half a decade, you will be getting a bona fide good game. Don't let age fool you, San Andreas is a lush, vibrant, jam-packed world of crime with half-forgotten gameplay tweaks and additions that will out at you out of the shadows of the past and cause huge grins to break out on your face.You play as Carl [Williams? I forget], an African American man returning home from the East Coast to bury his mother and - exactly to what extent this was part of his plans at the outset is unclear - reconnect with his initially grudging former gang bretheren and wrestle control of the San Andreas region from anyone else who might wish to stake some claim to it. Small fish prevail at the start, as a corrupt cop, double-dealing gang member, pathetic music artist hopeful and a few other similar characters have you running the kind of jobs that are best accompanied by NWA or Cypress Hill, but after a highlight of the game has come and gone - an all-out gang war in which you are free to dominate an entire city if you can be bothered - you are ejected out the refuse pipe of the starting city and sent scurrying across the redneck alpine regions between the SA towns, ending up in a different town full of different crooks and continuing on your quest for relevance and power.The game is long, the missions varied and often challenging, the vehicles more varied than ever and great fun. The list of characters is endless, and the gigantic environment offers hours upon hours of entertainment even when it is cordoned off into smaller regions at the start.Buy this game! It is guaranteed to be good value no matter the price, and it is a holdover from a time in gaming when things like the console wars persisted and the idea of single companies like EA or UbiSoft holding sway over vast spans of offered products was, while emryonic, merely background noise to the single-player offerings being offered for the iconic gaming platforms of the day. Of those offerings, GTA: SA is without a doubt in the topmost echelon.			"

San Andreas is my faviorte GTA game ever, If you ever wanted to be a gangster in the 90s etting this will be the perfect game for you. Besides the ocasianly killing and going on unimaginable killing spress or commting crimes this game has one of the BEST story in the whole gaming world. I would say even if you are not a GTA fanatic I would sure pick up this game from the endless fun doing anything you can imagine.			"

												A very strange PC port indeed... Changing resolutions can lead to a number of bugs forcing me to quit the game and come back. The singleplayer does feel a bit limiting since you have to finish all the missions to leave Los Santos without the entire police force coming for your♥♥♥♥♥ Some tracks were actually removed from the game in an update (win for the people with physical copies). As someone who didn't notice that at first though, it never bothered me, and it doesn't bother me now. You might be better off with a physical copy but who has optical drives these days? It's a decent game and I was into the story (until I forgot to back up my saves when doing a clean install of Windows 10). Buying this game for full price on steam is a bit of a stretch though. If you REALLY want it on your steam library wait for a sale or better yet buy a used copy of the game for PC. If you don't mind losing mods then other versions of the game such as the ps2 version might be a consideration. The only mod I've used so far is San Andreas Multiplayer which works better with a physical copy. Modding for the steam version is actually a chore itself which leads to the physical copy master race once more... In fact, I myself would consider samp a very strange thing to play... You might deal with scumbags but it might be fun. I had a lot of fun and I also hated playing it at times. The people who play it are absolute dickbags though. It is EASILY the worst community I had ever dealt with in a while, maybe all time. The owners on this server leave ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t loopholes as well allowing donators to choose their spawn and if they wish spawn at YOUR house and your spawn and be a total♥♥♥♥♥♥to people that didnt play GTA San Andreas since it launched. It doesn't help that door camping on that server is only camping if your crosshair is on the door and you shoot right as they leave, but standing on the top of their house is fair game. Now while this was one server, it was in a weird way the best one. A both better at the game community who happened to be a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s ruined it. Other servers with decent game modes are Mexican which can be a fun gimmick at first but the weirded out effect runs out eventually and the US servers are stuff like cops and robbers which is pretty lame IMO. Maybe my talk on samp went on too long but my original point still stands; if its on sale buying it might be a good idea but this isn't a full price game thanks to mods being somewhat broken on steam and used copies of the game having more content. All you need is a 1080p patch or something if you get the physical.			"

Nice Port! And it works on modern O.S.... GREAT (Y)One advice for gamers with modern PCs: Turn on ""Force V-Sync"" and ""Tripple Buffering"" with ""Frame Limiter: Off"" in your graphic card settings and then it will work greatly with 60 fps.A lot of vehicles (Cars, Trucks, Bikes, Planes, etc....) and one of the best ""open world"" made this game in my opinion to best game of Rockstar.You are able to go into missions or just drive around and make a lot of trouble ;-)A specific aspect was that the developers took care about a lot of details in the play set. That made GTA San Andreas unique.			"

												So I picked this game up in a trade for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game I did not want, and decided to play it since I have never played a 3D GTA before.  And I have to say, GTA: San Andreas is awesome.  From what I found, this steam version is a censored version, but great nonetheless.  Even on my potato, I get enough FPS to be able to play it, and the world is awesome, as are the ground and water vehicles (riding bicycles straight up mountains :D).  The story, at least as far as I have gotten, is good.  My biggest gripe however, are the planes and helicopters.  Controlling them is no easy task, and you are forced to fly both to continue the story, which is where I am currently stuck.  The aerial vehicles make me want to kill myself.Update:   I collaborated with a friend and he steered the plane while I controlled the acceleration and rudder and managed to make that work.  Pretty gay experience though.			"

												OK I'll be honest the update that removed mods and music and other stuff: It sucksBut when people say that the game doesn't work, that's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because your computer is most likely too advanced for it. Windows 7 is the best OS for this and if you have anything over that it most likely won't work.

												What can I say about this game? Well this is my favorite Grand Theft Auto title, I owned this game on Original Xbox, PS2, Xbox 360 and PC.  Yep.. I love it so much. On PC you can even play this game online, I spent over 100 hours on roleplay server, have amazing memories of this game, regular edition and with mods on PC, if you do not own this game yet I have to ask WHY??? The atmosphere is interesting, the storyline is interesting (apart from few bits I did not like a whole lot), the freedom this game offers is great as well. I replayed the story most likely 3 times, enjoyed it every time [Maybe I am bit crazy when it comes to San Andreas]PS. I will admit that I am a Rockstar fanboy so my opinion on their game is a bit biased but in all honesty only game Rockstar made that I played (almost all of them played) that I did not ''enjoy'' is Vice City Stories, simply didn't get into the story as I got tired of my PS2 days so never finished it.  Not saying it was bad, would like to see it on PC but whatever.To finish the review I will state something, GET GTA SAN ANDREAS, play trough it, either downgrade then steam version or back it up and play SAMP. If you did not enjoy San Andreas as much as me please let me know why.			"

												GTA: San Andreas is still the best Grand Theft Auto game in the series. After replaying this shortly after GTA:V i noticed a ton of architecture and city layouts that ended up in V the map in GTA:V may be larger but San Andreas fills the map to the brim with activities, areas of interest and gives you a great story that takes you on an odyssey across the diverse landscape of San Andreas. You dont have weapon attachments but there is always a tool for the job and SA is the first game in the series to feature stealth mechanics, functional silencers, and knife excecutions.  The voice work in this game is amazing with a star studded cast featuring James woods, Samuel L Jackson, Ice T, and more.The current steam version is a bit buggy and doesnt support mods so it is advised to roll back to avoid issues and use mods (if that's your thing). I played through with the latest pach and had to tweak the options and force some settings in NVIDIA Control panel but i eventualy got it running smooth as a fresh shaved goat. FYI i got this running on WIN10.10/10 Would lose the train again.			"

												     Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is one of my favorite games. But the only way I was able to properly enjoy it was through mods. I started to play the game a few years ago and stopped soon after, I found the mechanics of the game outdated and drive-bys a really big problem. Not to mention that there was some scaling problems which hindered the experience.      A few years after I stopped playing it, I saw it in my steam library, and then I decided to look through the guides of the game. I recently came off modding Skyrim and wanted another game that I could play for hundreds of hours. I heard that this game had a pretty good modding scene. So I installed the game and began to mod. Soon after, I realized that many of my little problems, could be fixed by modding. Then I marathoned the game, and loved it.     People have mentioned that to properly enjoy Goldeneye, you have to mod it for keyboard and mouse. But after that it  becomes a very competent game. I can say that Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was way ahead of its time in so many aspects, but some of the factors that way it down, can be fixed with mods.Verdict: Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a classic, but in order to get the most out of it, you have to mod it.

												A 2004 classic, that everyone has at least heard of. It's an amazing game for its time, but does it hold up today? Story The story has a lot more depth than you'd think for a GTA game. It's a story of grief, betrayal and revenge. It's a story of a family, and how they survive through the thick and thin. Even though some of the themes can be grim, the writing still makes you laugh. Graphics The graphics look like they belong in a Playstation 2 game, and that's because they do. The graphics are outdated, but what did you expect? It's a 2004 game. If you're bothered by the graphics, you can search for a graphics overhaul mod.  Gameplay This game made a lot of innovations in terms of gameplay. This was the first GTA game that allowed you to vault over obstacles and move while crouched. If you've played GTA IV or V, the controls might feel a bit clunky in comparison, and some things are missing entirely, like the ability to take cover behind a wall and to blind shoot.  Conclusion I'd say the game still holds up today, even if you've played the later ones. At the time San Andreas was considered to be a huge game, but GTA IV and V are probably larger than it. There's still loads of things to do, even if you only stick to the story missions. If you're interested in the game, I'd say give it a shot to see if you like it.  TL;DR The story is decent, the graphics are outdated and the gameplay is a bit clunky. If you're still interested, try it. You might just find a game you love.  "

												Outstanding. A very good game for those who want to go on rampages.Cons;I can't really list any cons. I had a overall amazing experience on this game, with no bad things about it.Pros:1) Los Santos2) A fairly large map for an old game3) Stats; unlike GTA V, theres a status for sex appeal, respect, and fatness.4) Cars are super fun to drive while using a keyboard!5) You can drive planes, unlike in GTA IV6) You obviously don't need a ""gaming pc"" for this game that came out in 2005. A regular pc or laptop will do.7) This game has a very good ""cheating"" system. With very fun cheat codes you can become a unstopable killing machine!!8) You can swim unlike in GTA III and GTA Vice City.9) I'm not sure about this, but when you flip your car upside down it takes around 5 seconds for it to light on fire unlike GTA III and Vice City when it lights on fire instantly.10) This game is more active than you think.

												Still an amazing game after all these years. The dated graphics are not as much of a turn-off as you might think, although the PC port is an occasional nightmare as far as stability and controls. You're going to want to mess around and reconfigure to make it remotely playable, especially for the flying missions. I also recommend saving your game often, because it freezes/crashes every couple hours or so. If the minor headache seems worth it to you, I definitely recommend playing this, if only for the nostalgia factor.			"

												Oh GTA:SA... the game that started it all..The year was 2008 and this was one of the first open world games i played. I was in 1st grade.I remember the only thing in my mind at school was to go home and play it.And the only thing i did at home was playing it.If i was not playing it, i was watching videos about the game on youtube. People recording their gameplay with unregistered hypercam, 007 sound system or drowning pool bodies playing in the background :))The entire game felt like an adventure, like i was in a another dimension. San Andreas had no rules, unless i made them. I could live as a law obeying citizen..or as a total jackass.I remember watching videos about bigfoot and leatherface at youtube...It brings back alot of memories such as me being too scared to go to Shady Creeks at night etc... :)It was a really unique game at the time and still is to this day.I dont care if GTA V is a better game or not, GTA:SA will forever be in my heart.If you havent played this before, i am jealous you can experience this masterpiece for the first time..10/10			"

												I've been playing this game since 2011. I don't mind for this game to be on PC. Actually this PC Steam Version is quite good so far. However, I've only encountered 1 minor issue that wasn't really major. I tried to save but it crashed. Though it does not crash now when I try saving my game.Originally posted by author: I will change this review if I encounter any major issues that just endlessly pop up.	So far recommend this! I'm enjoying the game once more.  Bugs Crashes   No bugs yet. Crashed once when tried saving but now it stopped.  "

												Without a doubt the best GTA-game to date. The large island of San Andreas is huge and contains three very large and detailed cities. The nature of world is also very varied, with mountains in the west, desert in the north and hilly grassland in the south.Between the three large cities of Las Venturas, Los Santos and San Fierro you have a pretty large amount of small towns, lakes, railroads and much much more. Combine the huge world with a seemingly unlimited amount of side missions and activities and a very well written story and you get a extremely entertaining game.This is one of my all-time favorite games and is still in my opinion Rockstars greatest title to date.

												So I picked this game up in a trade for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game I did not want, and decided to play it since I have never played a 3D GTA before.  And I have to say, GTA: San Andreas is awesome.  From what I found, this steam version is a censored version, but great nonetheless.  Even on my potato, I get enough FPS to be able to play it, and the world is awesome, as are the ground and water vehicles (riding bicycles straight up mountains :D).  The story, at least as far as I have gotten, is good.  My biggest gripe however, are the planes and helicopters.  Controlling them is no easy task, and you are forced to fly both to continue the story, which is where I am currently stuck.  The aerial vehicles make me want to kill myself.Update:   I collaborated with a friend and he steered the plane while I controlled the acceleration and rudder and managed to make that work.  Pretty gay experience though.			"

												I used to play this when it first came out on Xbox and PS2 and had a lot of fun and the old GTA pack was on sale so I decided to purchase it no bring back some good memories. I wound up getting pretty far in the game but got too lazy to finish it. It's still fun, I haven't tried the mods but I hear they're pretty good. Sadly this game doesn't have workshop support. There's only one GTA with a better campaign than this one and in my opinion that's GTA IV. I don't regret purchasing this, however I do regret purchasing the pack as I never play the other included games.			"

												There are already plenty of brilliant reviews for this game. I just want to add a very simple ""thumbs up"" and recommendation here as well. SAN ANDREAS is one of the finest games ever created. Pioneered and revolutionized the genre (singleplayer, open-world, action, adventure). Enormous world to explore, from Los Santos, to San Fiero, to Las Venturas. Endless fun to be had. Quality writing, story and creativity, as always from ROCKSTAR. This is a must-play game. My rating for GRAND THEFT AUTO: SAN ANDREAS: 10 out of 10.			"

												A 2004 classic, that everyone has at least heard of. It's an amazing game for its time, but does it hold up today? Story The story has a lot more depth than you'd think for a GTA game. It's a story of grief, betrayal and revenge. It's a story of a family, and how they survive through the thick and thin. Even though some of the themes can be grim, the writing still makes you laugh. Graphics The graphics look like they belong in a Playstation 2 game, and that's because they do. The graphics are outdated, but what did you expect? It's a 2004 game. If you're bothered by the graphics, you can search for a graphics overhaul mod.  Gameplay This game made a lot of innovations in terms of gameplay. This was the first GTA game that allowed you to vault over obstacles and move while crouched. If you've played GTA IV or V, the controls might feel a bit clunky in comparison, and some things are missing entirely, like the ability to take cover behind a wall and to blind shoot.  Conclusion I'd say the game still holds up today, even if you've played the later ones. At the time San Andreas was considered to be a huge game, but GTA IV and V are probably larger than it. There's still loads of things to do, even if you only stick to the story missions. If you're interested in the game, I'd say give it a shot to see if you like it.  TL;DR The story is decent, the graphics are outdated and the gameplay is a bit clunky. If you're still interested, try it. You might just find a game you love.  "

												When people think old school, tetris may come to mind, well. For many people Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a strong choice. The land of drug-dealers and gangbangers will see the straight busta CJ, come back to Los Santos. Become rich and kill some fools. If you want nostalgia and a real good blast of a game that at 10 o'clock makes you think, oh no where did my afternoon go, I recommend GTA:SA			"

												Oh GTA:SA... the game that started it all..The year was 2008 and this was one of the first open world games i played. I was in 1st grade.I remember the only thing in my mind at school was to go home and play it.And the only thing i did at home was playing it.If i was not playing it, i was watching videos about the game on youtube. People recording their gameplay with unregistered hypercam, 007 sound system or drowning pool bodies playing in the background :))The entire game felt like an adventure, like i was in a another dimension. San Andreas had no rules, unless i made them. I could live as a law obeying citizen..or as a total jackass.I remember watching videos about bigfoot and leatherface at youtube...It brings back alot of memories such as me being too scared to go to Shady Creeks at night etc... :)It was a really unique game at the time and still is to this day.I dont care if GTA V is a better game or not, GTA:SA will forever be in my heart.If you havent played this before, i am jealous you can experience this masterpiece for the first time..10/10			"

												Oh, San Andreas.  Honestly the best GTA ever, with a map and story so large it would take any person a least 30 hours to just run the story.  It has loads of mini-games that actually feel integral to the game, not just tacked on for the sake of content.  It was the first GTA to have a deep vehicle customization, but none of this ""instantly recall your car after you wreck it"" nonsense.  Its not without its flaws, but it is so deep rooted in nostolgia that I can only reccomend this game immensely.Also works well on new systems, runs fine on Windows 7, FX 8350, and a GTX 960.If you don't have it already, do yourself a favor this winter and replay this PS2 masterpiece, you won't regret it.

												I remember 7 year old me walking into a dingy computer room. A washed out sign read above the doorway ""GameZone"", if I recall correctly. It was a tight 6x6 space, a dimming light above several desks, there were maybe 6 or 7 computers. Cigarette smoke rising in the air, flattened coke cans on the floor. Smelly teens with a face full of pimples and grease in their hair, children of all ages, gathered all around the fat CRT monitors, playing Counter Strike 1.6, Diablo II and then there was this game... Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.   For 0.50¢ and hour you could have this game all to yourself. And we didn't even do the missions! We just rode around on motorcycles, sped up in cars and had massive shootouts with the police. And the cheats... Oh, all the glorious cheats! Everyone knew them: HESOYAM, OHDUDE, BUFFMEUP, UZUMYMW... A single kid paid the price, but 10 kids played the game together in harmony. Sharing cheats and showing off hacks and tricks. ""Grove Street. Home..."" ♥			"

												Extremely good game, expands on the established norms in the GTA 3D world and exception story with very likable and believable characters. Lengthy story will keep you hooked and preoccupied for at least 30 hours, and another 20 hours exploring San Andreas and accomplishing side missions and quests. Story is bar none probably one of the best so far in the GTA Series, second to maybe the HD Universe. Old and new characters alike are involved in this journey of one man trying to restablish his ties with his family, but along the way get caught up in a much more bigger plot. The only drawback and downfall of this game is the relatively large empty areas some cities have contained, as the playing field is very large, but has very little to offer in terms of size and it seemingly feels like the areas could have been more condensed with more focus on one area rather than expanding out with little to see. 8.7/10			"

												If you didn't already play this on the PS2 or Xbox, then you really must play it. It's revolutionary in the GTA franchise as far as gameplay elements go. It's almost like an RPG with the stats system and the attitude of having to maintain your characters physical appearance was a bonus. Sure, the graphics haven't aged well, but the 14 square miles have plenty to explore.The story is sprawling like a historical epic. You are CJ, a busta living in the hood just trying to get by in life, but is caught up in gang related issues involving your brother Sweet and childhood friend, Smoke. While helping take control of Los Santos you are forced into exile from corrupt cops and this is where the exploration gets amazing. San Andreas has three cities and a massive open range of hills and mountains to drive around, aimlessly if you like. Or you could look for bigfoot.As the story progresses, you'll fall in love with the game's aesthetic for deciding if your CJ should be fat from eating a lot and not exercising, or is a beefcake. You will buy homes and safehouses where you can store cars. You will take control of the city.I never found bigfoot though.9.5/10			"

												The 90s were a special time. The International reputation of the USA was more closely aligned with baseball, basketball Disney and a naughty President than the decidedly militaristic and dark cloak it would come to adopt in the coming century. The internet had not made information instantly accessible and the world therefore felt so much larger, so much more varied and unknowable. NWA, gangsta rap in general and various news stories had suggested the dangers of gangland Los Angeles, among other places, but these things were all distant, almost mythological.Poking above the waves in the late 90s however was a series of top-down crime simulation computer games known as GTA which would eventually bring this entire world of crime right to your TV or computer screens. A catchy title, the first two installments (and an expansion or two) had the players navigating a city viewed from above, running their little sprite around shooting people, stealing cars, jumping bridges and delivering bombs. Addictive gameplay was given an edge by a high degree of polish, vaguely black humor, outlandish micro-plots and satisfying - if unrealistic - vehicle gameplay to be enjoyed alongside some hilarious radio channels.When GTA 3 came out at the turn of the century these things were translated more or less directly into a 3D world, meeting with huge success and revolutionising the public concept of exactly how much we would be able to expect from computer games going forward. An entire, full scale city was rendered for us in seamless 3D (a short draw distance not being noticed as there was no real precedent to hold the game up against) Beyond the graphics, the gameplay was every bit as darkly fun and raunchy as it had been in the 2D games, only this time in full 3D with a distinctive visual style - and of course the car driving was still there, satisfying as ever, with those radio stations becomming a core feature of the game - ah, Lazlow.The exceptional expansion GTA Vice City had come and gone - arguably staking a solid claim to being the best game in the entire series with the quantum leaps the game offered in terms of gameplay and, if less noticably, graphics - and before you knew it a new title had been announced: GTA San Andreas.Things were different this time around. Consumer commitment would be tested by a huge change in tone from the white trash east-coast earlier games to a Gangsta Rap-inspired west coast rendition of Los Angeles gang warfare, headlined by an African American protagonist, and radio stations which would be booming out rap classics. Rockstar by now was building a third title for the ageing PS2 system, and the technological bottleneck which meant that the graphics in this game were only separated from Vice City by aesthetic margins - more polygonal detail on cars and most other objects, more vibrant colours, a more evocative set of terrain types - meant that a huge amount of attention was fixed on shoehorning more and more gameplay innovations into the package.Looking back each GTA title released on the PS2 was a quantum leap ahead of previous titles in terms of gameplay. GTA IV would arguably buck this trend - perhaps they ran out of ways to innovate, perhaps the power of the new system was too potent for them to focus on their other obligations - but San Andreas really was a bigger, badder, better game than any previous title. As such this review stands as a solemn assurance: buy this game, and you will be getting extreme value for money, you will be getting the best crime simulation experience that was available to the world for half a decade, you will be getting a bona fide good game. Don't let age fool you, San Andreas is a lush, vibrant, jam-packed world of crime with half-forgotten gameplay tweaks and additions that will out at you out of the shadows of the past and cause huge grins to break out on your face.You play as Carl [Williams? I forget], an African American man returning home from the East Coast to bury his mother and - exactly to what extent this was part of his plans at the outset is unclear - reconnect with his initially grudging former gang bretheren and wrestle control of the San Andreas region from anyone else who might wish to stake some claim to it. Small fish prevail at the start, as a corrupt cop, double-dealing gang member, pathetic music artist hopeful and a few other similar characters have you running the kind of jobs that are best accompanied by NWA or Cypress Hill, but after a highlight of the game has come and gone - an all-out gang war in which you are free to dominate an entire city if you can be bothered - you are ejected out the refuse pipe of the starting city and sent scurrying across the redneck alpine regions between the SA towns, ending up in a different town full of different crooks and continuing on your quest for relevance and power.The game is long, the missions varied and often challenging, the vehicles more varied than ever and great fun. The list of characters is endless, and the gigantic environment offers hours upon hours of entertainment even when it is cordoned off into smaller regions at the start.Buy this game! It is guaranteed to be good value no matter the price, and it is a holdover from a time in gaming when things like the console wars persisted and the idea of single companies like EA or UbiSoft holding sway over vast spans of offered products was, while emryonic, merely background noise to the single-player offerings being offered for the iconic gaming platforms of the day. Of those offerings, GTA: SA is without a doubt in the topmost echelon.			"

My favorite from the GTA franchise, to be precise, but there's one thing that made me refund the game.First thing I do after launching the game for the first time is adjust the settings. There's one problem, though. To get a satisfying 60 FPS I must disable frame limiter; which I can do without issues. This is where the problem reveals itself. Although the game runs smoothly, when driving a vehicle, it seems as if the brakes are constantly used. After several hours of trying to solve the problem, practically nothing has changed.I will still give it a thumbs up. There's literally no other reason why I chose to refund.			"

												Oh GTA:SA... the game that started it all..The year was 2008 and this was one of the first open world games i played. I was in 1st grade.I remember the only thing in my mind at school was to go home and play it.And the only thing i did at home was playing it.If i was not playing it, i was watching videos about the game on youtube. People recording their gameplay with unregistered hypercam, 007 sound system or drowning pool bodies playing in the background :))The entire game felt like an adventure, like i was in a another dimension. San Andreas had no rules, unless i made them. I could live as a law obeying citizen..or as a total jackass.I remember watching videos about bigfoot and leatherface at youtube...It brings back alot of memories such as me being too scared to go to Shady Creeks at night etc... :)It was a really unique game at the time and still is to this day.I dont care if GTA V is a better game or not, GTA:SA will forever be in my heart.If you havent played this before, i am jealous you can experience this masterpiece for the first time..10/10			"

												This is far the best Grand Theft Auto game from the series. Some may say that ""Vice City"" is the best but everyone has their prefferences. Anyway, this game is really good, and I recommand it to everyone who loves the series, but instead of buying it from Steam, try to buy it from somewhere else because GTA SA Steam edition has a lot of content cut, and you can't mod it using cleo3. But if you wish to buy it from here just to have it in your games collection, like I did, go ahead. The Steam edition can be fixed anyway with some patches from the internet.			"

Nice Port! And it works on modern O.S.... GREAT (Y)One advice for gamers with modern PCs: Turn on ""Force V-Sync"" and ""Tripple Buffering"" with ""Frame Limiter: Off"" in your graphic card settings and then it will work greatly with 60 fps.A lot of vehicles (Cars, Trucks, Bikes, Planes, etc....) and one of the best ""open world"" made this game in my opinion to best game of Rockstar.You are able to go into missions or just drive around and make a lot of trouble ;-)A specific aspect was that the developers took care about a lot of details in the play set. That made GTA San Andreas unique.			"

												I used to play this when it first came out on Xbox and PS2 and had a lot of fun and the old GTA pack was on sale so I decided to purchase it no bring back some good memories. I wound up getting pretty far in the game but got too lazy to finish it. It's still fun, I haven't tried the mods but I hear they're pretty good. Sadly this game doesn't have workshop support. There's only one GTA with a better campaign than this one and in my opinion that's GTA IV. I don't regret purchasing this, however I do regret purchasing the pack as I never play the other included games.			"

CJ buys an aircraft graveyard under orders of Toreno.Toreno wants CJ to learn flying, and CJ becomes a ACE Pilot. then he gets invited to Las Venturas, and then He does more jobs with Wu Zi Mu. Then he does jobs for the caligulas casino because of the crooked lawyer, Ken Rosenberg. then the Leone family tooks over the casino because of Johnny Sindacco's death. and he works with Mr. Leone.  who gives the hardest ♥♥♥♥ing mission in the game  after some missions, CJ robs caligulas casino with the triads, and then leaves for Los Santos.when he is in Los Santos, he works as madd doggs manager, where he also does missions involving stealing a military jet from easter basin naval base under orders of toreno again, and in return, Toreno releases Sweet from prison. he and Sweet take over grove street again, and idlewood too,after 2 missions, Tenpenny is in court and found not-guilty for lack of evidance.  Which causes Los Santos to burn in riots. CJ and Sweet kill Big Smoke during the riot, and then they kill Tenpenny to end the riot. Tenpenny dies of traffic crash to grove street, after falling down to the street from bridge with a firetruck. and the credits roll. after the credits, WCTR News report that Tenpenny's body was mutilated by the homeless.in shortCarl ""CJ"" Johnson went zero to hero, then hero to zero instantly then wents zero to multi-millioner hero (oh and Ghetto hero too), WHY ARE YOU READING THIS, BUY THE DAMN GAME ALREADY			"

												All you have to do, is follow the damn mission markers, CJ.Seriously though it's a good game. I used to have it on disk, but then I lost it.  At any rate, I've found its replay value surpasses all the other GTAs. Or maybe that's my nostalgia talking, I don't know.  I do like the level of customization, from skinny to fat, every type of clothing you want, and  a larger hair selection than GTA V (singleplayer).  The missions can be tough sometimes, but most of them are fun.  Weapons are satisying enough, and I used to spend my time writing down all the cheats.  I still have some memorized, like ""JumpJet"" and ""HESOYAM"".10/10 would waste entire weeks until my laptop melted near the last mission so I lost all my progress and then I didn't play it for years again.

												What an insane classic game, GTA San Andreas takes place in 1992 San Andreas (Los Santos, Las Ventures, San Fierro, Flint Country, and Bone Country which is now known as Blain Country in GTA 5) which San Andrea sis based on Califronia, Las Ventures is based on Las Vegas which isn't even in California but whatever, and others which are pretty well known so I'm done explaining the locations. Wait, one more thing the locations are all bordered up due to a storm or some stupid excuse to not explore the entire map at the beginning of the game which I guess they knew you were going to, they eventally all are taken down and the player is allowed to explore the game as the main story unfolds. Anywany CJ (Carl Johnson) leaves Liberty City which he stayed at for six years to Los Santos and on the way to Grove Street while taking a Taxi, he is pulled over by our main villian, Officer Frank Tenpenny (Voiced by Samuel Jackson) with the help of Officer Eddie Pulaski (I don't know his actor infact I only know Samuel Jackson voiced Tenpenny and James Woods voiced that bussiness guy that is also in the main story but I'm not getting into that) and Officer Jimmy Hernandez. If you seen ""The Introduction"" which is set before teh events of GTA San Andreas and after the evnets of GTA Vice City and GTA Vice City Stories though nly GTA Vice City is refrenced with Ken Rosenberg appearing and he main villian Sonny from GTA Vice City who spolier alert, one more time. SPOILER ALERT SKIP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH SO YOU AREN'T SPOILED ABOUT THE END OF GTA VICE CITY, anyway who was killed by Tommy Vercetti at the end of GTA Vice City and his death is mentioned in GTA San Andreas's introduction and on a billboard in GTA Liberty City Stories which a documentary is said to be made about his death. Woah, I need to start talking about the game, a little more about the story and I go on about the gameplay and some other stuff. Anyway Officer Tenpenny arrests CJ as he is a corrupt cop along with Officer Pulaski, but, Officer Jimmy Hernandez isn't a corrupt cop and later on it is revealed, also spoiler alert yeah I can't talk about this game without talking about the story to much, anyway, it is revealed Jimmy alerts the higher ups and Officer Frank Tenpenny and Officer Eddie Pulaski are caught which leads to alot of story and stuff and Jimmy is killed by Eddie after trying to save CJ, CJ kills Eddie right afterwards, and Frank s killed by really himself after crashing a Fire Engine off a bridge. Jesus Christ I'm done with the story I'm sorry, great story really great but I'm talking about gameplay now. GTA San Andreas focuses on Cars, Boats, and Helicopters like GTA 3 and GTA Vice City did before but this time GTA San Andreas includes airplanes (I know the Dodo was in GTA 3 but that was it and was a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to control in the first place so just calm down). Also, you could swim in this game for the first time unlike GTA 3 and GTA Vice City where it appears Claude and Tommy skipped swimming classes back in school, luckily swimming was Carl's favority class and we can even dive down which isn't as good as GTA 5 looks but hey it was Rockstar's first try and they did an okay job, pratice makes perfect which GTA 5 isn't perfect but come on it is probably the best Rockstar game out there. Also the cheats in GTA San Andreas are so good, well, more funny then good I guess but still cool. I wasn't able to play mutiplayer which I am planning on playing soon, looks interesting. Anway, GTA San Andreas is a great game, classic, with all those myths and legends which I was planning on talking about but I think I am going in this too much. I would instantly give GTA San Andreas a recommendation no questiosn asked.  "

												Without a doubt the best GTA-game to date. The large island of San Andreas is huge and contains three very large and detailed cities. The nature of world is also very varied, with mountains in the west, desert in the north and hilly grassland in the south.Between the three large cities of Las Venturas, Los Santos and San Fierro you have a pretty large amount of small towns, lakes, railroads and much much more. Combine the huge world with a seemingly unlimited amount of side missions and activities and a very well written story and you get a extremely entertaining game.This is one of my all-time favorite games and is still in my opinion Rockstars greatest title to date.

												So I picked this game up in a trade for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game I did not want, and decided to play it since I have never played a 3D GTA before.  And I have to say, GTA: San Andreas is awesome.  From what I found, this steam version is a censored version, but great nonetheless.  Even on my potato, I get enough FPS to be able to play it, and the world is awesome, as are the ground and water vehicles (riding bicycles straight up mountains :D).  The story, at least as far as I have gotten, is good.  My biggest gripe however, are the planes and helicopters.  Controlling them is no easy task, and you are forced to fly both to continue the story, which is where I am currently stuck.  The aerial vehicles make me want to kill myself.Update:   I collaborated with a friend and he steered the plane while I controlled the acceleration and rudder and managed to make that work.  Pretty gay experience though.			"

												Arguably one of the best GTA titles.Be aware that this game was not meant to be played 60 frames on a pc. So configuring controls, sensitivity can be a chore. Running it on 60 frames will break a few mechanics of the game (swimming for me). Optimal to play with a controller. Have fun!			"

												A definitive classic, and a must-play game of every person who lived in the early 00s. GTA:SA was pretty much one of the foundations of the 00s gaming era, and I'm pretty sure that it was part of every gamer's rooms back then. Be it on the PS2 or on PC, that doesn't make any difference at all. Because no matter on what platform you chose to play this, it provided you with the exact same type and amount of fun, joy and entertainment. From carjacking, carrying rocket launchers on the street, riding tanks on the road, killing pr*stitutes (for some reason Steam censored this word lmao), participating in and/or inciting gang fights to infiltrating Area 51, riding jetpacks and dominating the city, this game definitely delivered what it promised, and with that also helped a lot with shaping Rockstar's signature game-making style once and for all.

												Easily one of the best GTA's ever made. This game was one of the last GTA's to offer a true sandbox and roleplay experience with several side activies to boot. These features would be ethier very lacking or missing entierly in the major modern era GTA games (gta 4 and 5 respectivly) in comparison to San Andreas. While personally i like GTA 4's story more GTA San Andreas story is a close second. The only downside to the PC port is the controls are inverted in places they shouldn't be (the lowrider rythem minigame is a good example of this). Overall if you feel like playing one of the older GTA's start with this one as it's easily one of the best ones.			"

												My actual playtime for this game is off-record, based off of the years I spent on it via disk, when I didn't actually own Steam. I would say 300+ hours playtime.San Andreas remains to be my favourite of the series.- Great story, great music.- Full character customisation- The map is gloriously huge, with 3 different ambient settings- Huge variety with side quests and tasks- Character skill building via gym. RPG element is GO.K-Rose remains to be my favourite radio station. Everyone else in my house as a child hated K-Rose. Or at least my singing to K-Rose. Or maybe it was just repeating the whole thing over and over in a badly imitated accent, including the pool table birth part.One of my favourite things to do, was see how many vehicles I could destroy by parking my car in the middle of the road and shooting the gas tank. You'd be surprised how many people need eye tests. I swear another 10 cars would drive right into that thing without stopping.Best way to make cash, ever.The 5 star police chases when I flew my plane over area 69, resulting in a hasty parachute down in a complete panic, were intense. One of the most comfortable games to play ever. If you haven't tried GTA before, I recommend playing this one before GTA V.			"

I would recommend buying the physical PC version of this game or (god forbid) pirating this game to tell Rockstar that this sort of patch is unacceptable in this day and age.			"

Increasing your swimming level consists of going into some water for a bit. Nothing interesting about it.			"

One of the most diversified open-world maps of gaming history despite not being particularly large. The chaotic environment and skyscrappers of Los Santos, the misty and modern feel of San Fierro, the countryside between them and the desert hosting an infamous parody of Area 51 (Area 69 in the game) and a purchaseable abandoned aistrip where you can take flying lessons.

												*WARNING THIS HAS SPOILERS, THEY ARE ABOUT THE INTRODUCTION AND THE WEAPONS, ALSO I TALK ABOUT A CERTAIN VEHICLE YOU GET IN THE GAME LATER.  ALSO THIS IS FROM THE TOP OF MY HEAD, SO SOME INFORMATION MAY BE INCORRECT, FINALLY I TALK ABOUT AN INAPPROPRIATE THING, THIS IS YOUR WARNING*This game is SUCH a great game, while the graphics do seem a bit lack-luster considering it came out in like 2004, if you compare it to Half-Life 2.  Also some of the controlls are hard to learn on the PC.  Also diving and swimming under water is a problem, i still don't know how to do it, but it is important for a mission of the game luckily i still beat it by climbing on a rock and jumping to a rock in the direction I had to go (Name of mission is Amphibious Assualt, you also need a decent lung capacity skill to actually start the mission, to train that you need to dive underwater alot and it takes a decent ammount of time, also the rock I was talking about is where you jump down but you have to look behind you down there to see it, it's like right behind you), also there are various glitches and you should save your game alot, like getting killed by a bush or standing on a car and dieing.  Ok enough of that let me go into details.  I probably took about 30 hours to complete it, 30 HOURS, for a 15$ Game that's really good, and while the game frustrates me at times it still is a great game.  I can't really talk about the story very much cause of spoilers and stuff and I skipped through A LOT of the cutscenes cause im impatient.  Here's the introduction, you are CJ (Carl Johnson) a gangster who was part of the Grove Street Families (GSF) whose older brother, Sweet, is the leader of.  CJ left San Andreas after his younger brother was killed and went to Liberty City and had a decent life with crime.  But when his mother was killed in a drive-by it's time for Carl to come home.  Some key features are gang warfare in which you take over other gangs territories (Ballas and Vagos) to become the biggest gang and to generate more money which will be generated at the Johnson House.  Also there is a HUGE ammount of weapons.  The weapons include:  pistol, sub-machine gun (two variants), smg, ak47, m4, rocket launcher, shotgun, sawn-off shotgun, combat shotgun, heat-seeking missile rocket launcher, flamethrower, MINIGUN, desert eagle, silenced pistol, knife, katana, chainsaw, baseball bat, shovel, flowers (can also be used as a gift for girlfriends,  a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(also can be used as a gift) for girlfriends), maybe a vibrator (not exactly sure about this one), spray paint, and a fire extinguisher (can also be used to put out fires).  Im not sure if these are all the weapons but this is most of them.  YOU CAN ALSO GET A JETPACK YEAH!!! There's also a skill system.  Sorry but this is all I can do for now maybe I'll add to this later, but maybe not, sorry it's 11:53 PM and I'm tired.If you found this review helpful please give it a thumb up, please because this took me like 15-25 minutes.  ALSO I APOLOGIZE IF I DIDN'T INCLUDE SOMETHING OR SOME INFORMATION IS INCORRECT! "

One of the most diversified open-world maps of gaming history despite not being particularly large. The chaotic environment and skyscrappers of Los Santos, the misty and modern feel of San Fierro, the countryside between them and the desert hosting an infamous parody of Area 51 (Area 69 in the game) and a purchaseable abandoned aistrip where you can take flying lessons. The luxury and casinos of Las Venturas. And there's more to it, waiting for you to explore.Best game ever.			"

												Great game, one of the best GTA games due to the amount of content. GTA 5 is missing many features GTA SA had such as, food/drive thrus, working out, playing video games in a video game, dating, hot coffee, easter eggs, and many more features that make this game a classic and a amazing game in general.

												yes this version has some problems and cut out some of the music but it is by no means unplayeble, or at least in my experience. If you still have an origional XBOX or PS2 at home you're better off buying it on those consoles (unless you want to mod it), but if you haven't this version will do just fine. in my opinion this still is the best GTA and the best 6th generation game out there and maybe even the best game ever (or at the very least a very close second). If you want the PC version before the patch and with all the music DON'T get it on steam. there are plenty of copies out there and you can probably get V2.0 or even lower (which is better if you want to mod it) for less money than the steam version.

Grapics are old, the sound kinda bad, but nonethless i still love this game. The story itself is amazing, leaving me guessing what's gonna happen next, craving for more.All in all, if you like killing, old dating sims, shooting, racing, or flying, this is a game for you!			"

												This is one of my all time favorite games. The freedom of running around in a huge world with so many fun things to do and create your own fun is incredible. I am strongly against altering a game in a way that degrades the experience also without users consent. Several songs were removed without consent of the customers. Imagine if this were any other medium. Imagine if you put your favorite movie into your player and they removed songs from your copy that you purchased. This is something users should not stand for. There needs to be protection for both artists and consumers from this type of treatment. Your artistic creation should remain intact as you intended it to be and the consumer should be confident that the latest knee jerk reaction to some event won't be able to automatically steal or censor your content. Make no mistake, this behavior will continue and only get worse unless we stand up for our rights.			"

												Five years ago Carl Johnson escaped from the pressures of life in Los Santos, San Andreas...a city tearing itself apart with gang trouble, drugs and corruption. Where filmstars and millionaires do their best to avoid the dealers and gangbangers.Now, it's the early 90s. Carl's got to go home. His mother has been murdered, his family has fallen apart and his childhood friends are all heading towards disaster.On his return to the neighborhood, a couple of corrupt cops frame him for homicide. CJ is forced on a journey that takes him across the entire state of San Andreas, to save his family and to take control of the streets.			"

												A classic, must play for all shooter fans! Although i havent completed the game ever (Too caught up terrorizing the city), i still find myself thinking of this, as the best game ever made. If i had to choose, i'd even pick this over GTA 5! Grapics are old, the sound kinda bad, but nonethless i still love this game. The story itself is amazing, leaving me guessing what's gonna happen next, craving for more.All in all, if you like killing, old dating sims, shooting, racing, or flying, this is a game for you!			"

												I have spent quite a bit of time listening to people talk about how great this game was.  Prety much from the time of it's release many of my friends told me about how much fun it was.  Myself I cannot get past how awful the controlls are, and perhaps thats just a sign of a bad port to PC.  For a game that spends so much time driving you'd think the cars would be drivable, but the driving in this game is laughable.  It's more frustration than anything else, only being usable due to the lack of other cars on the road.  Most of the time the road either in your lane or oncomming trafic is clear so you don't have to worry about room to drive.  If you do happen to bump something the pinball collision bumpers will engage and through you completely off course, even if it's low speed bump against a light pole on your rear you may be sent spinning... The on foot controlls are just as bad, most especialy the combat.  Being another major factor in the game play the guns and melee combat are horribly underdeveloped.  Aiming a gun using the mouse is clunky and less responsive than the original Doom.  The melee is just as bad making the melee in Morowind look like and advaced hand to hand combat simulator.  In several quest mandatory minigames I was left high and dry to figure out the controlls, and even worse durring at least one quest (Cesar Vialpando) the controlls were reversed to what the on screen prompts asked for. One of the most frustrating things about this game is the save system.  In order to save a game you must return to your safe house... no mater how far away that safe house is.  It is simply absurd that there was not an option to save on the spot even if loading a save spawned the character at the safe house being forced to return there any tiem you want to save means that saving your progress could take five minutes or more.  Saving should not be an exercise in patience.Finally, a big disapointment for me was the lack of anything interesting to do or see outside of listening to the radio and missions.  The city is very large, and well designed.  Driving around however it is just a bunch of buildings you can't enter  with NPCs milling about.  Occasionally you might hear a snip of conversation that may make you chuckle but the city is quite dull... whats the point of an open world sand box if there isn't anything to do.  I found this game to be a little ore than a struggle against the controlls with little to speak for it other than a beautifull, static city			"

												Having played and finished GTA: San Andreas on PS2 I bought this to relive the game and possibly try out some mods,after Rockstars update from last year though, the game has gotten incredibly hard to enjoy.What seemed like a nice upgrade, adding Xbox-controller support for example, ended up ruining the game with plenty of technical issues, such as, but not limited to; Stutter with Vsync / AA enabled Voices of NPCs being morphed into strange robot-like voices Cars always braking whenever you choose not to accelerate UI not adapting to Xbox-controller (left Dpad being 'JOY1' and right Dpad being 'JOY13' for example)Yes, it's the same GTA: San Andreas you used to enjoy, with the great voice acting, but since it has such an array of technical issues I can simply not recommend this.If you'd like to enjoy GTA: San Andreas on PC, try to find a disc-version.They're easier to mod and seem to work fine.

												How dare Rockstar remove songs from a game you already purchased before they lost the rights to it. I can maybe have let it slide if they removed the songs from any copies bought after the date in which the rights were lost but no they will just take it from anyone that has a digital copy. And this is what's messed up with the digital only world we have made for ourselves. We have waived our rights of ownership for the convenience of downloading. We no longer purchase games, we rent them and can have them taken from us or modified at any point of time. Can we do anything about this? Well no because when downloading these games you are agreeing to a bunch of legal nonsense that pretty much says we are screwing you over and there is nothing you can do about it. The best part is the consumers of digital games don't get a break anywhere, digital games cost the same as a hard copy, you can't let a friend borrow it, you can't trade it or sell it to a gamestop and on top of all that if they want to remove a bunch of content from the game in the future they have every right too. What do we get? We get F'ed in our A for the luxury of downloading something instead of going to a store and just buying it off the shelf. I have fallen for this con many times myself and after dealing with stuff like this I am no longer a consumer of digital goods. Thanks Rockstar, Steam, Microsoft, Ubisoft, EA and the rest of you, you all suck.			"

The version on the Windows app store is better than this.*Edit*I figured out my controller was plugged into my usb 3.0 slot and that was the problem, or at least I think it was.

												This is one of my all time favorite games. The freedom of running around in a huge world with so many fun things to do and create your own fun is incredible. I am strongly against altering a game in a way that degrades the experience also without users consent. Several songs were removed without consent of the customers. Imagine if this were any other medium. Imagine if you put your favorite movie into your player and they removed songs from your copy that you purchased. This is something users should not stand for. There needs to be protection for both artists and consumers from this type of treatment. Your artistic creation should remain intact as you intended it to be and the consumer should be confident that the latest knee jerk reaction to some event won't be able to automatically steal or censor your content. Make no mistake, this behavior will continue and only get worse unless we stand up for our rights.			"

												This PC port is the absolute worst. Whoever created this needs to pull their heads out of their rears. I can make a game on Microsoft Powerpoint that runs better than this. I got it free with the pre-purchase of GTA V, but in no way shape or form is this worth the trouble. It runs flawlessly on ps2, but this is absolute garbage on PC. Save yourself the time and money and don't even buy it, unless it's for ps2 or xbox.			"

												Shot at a Cop got one star, the shooting caused a traffic jam in which a civillian ran a second cop over. I got blamed for it, 2 stars and ran off listening to Black and Tans by the Wolfe Tones :D 10/10Been playing the heII out of this game, tryin to be a stand up OG baby. People say some recent patch f**ks the game all up but I have had no troubles minus some light mouse issues that can be fixed with hitting the Esc button a few times. Recived this game I think Friday Night (January 2015). This game is top notch.			"

												I already have the retail version of this game on PC which I have spent countless hours playing the SA:MP mod alone and achieved 100% completion, so please ignore my playing time on the Steam version.It really sucks how Rockstar took out 18 songs from the in-game soundtrack in the recent 'update'. You can no longer wreak havoc in the city with a Hydra while listening to Killing in The Name or fly over the desert while blasting to Runnin' Down a Dream. Well you can, but you would need iTunes or some other media player running in the background or just manually add the songs back in to the custom radio station, but even then you still wouldn't get to listen to the DJ's witty and snide remarks at the beginning or end of each song.Do I recommend this game? Definitely. San Andreas has been a monumental game in the open-world genre since its inception in 2004. But don't the Steam version - get the retail version if you can - unless if there is a mod somewhere that adds the original audio files back in to the radio station. However, be aware that the retail version does have compatibility issues with Windows 8/8.1. I have the Steam version only because I got it for free with my pre-order of GTA V.			"

												(This is more of a rant than a review, but I am really upset about this and I am sure many people relate to me on this due to Rockstar's history of Porting)This port has graduated into a ♥♥♥♥ing mess. Unfit for modern systems.I spent the last three days attempting to get this game to work on my Gaming Laptop only for me to realize how broken it is. I won't talk about the changes from the PS2 aesthetically. There are mods for that and that is a subjective topic anyways.No, i would like to talk about how the first setting for anti-aliasing brings my laptop that can run Fallout 4 on Max settings to its knees. I got to Whetstone 4 years ago on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC with 1 GB of RAM, Pentium 4 and an Intel 82865G GPU. Then I beat it on the same thing, except with an extra GB of RAM and a Core 2 Duo.So why is this game nigh-unplayable on my GTX 960M GPU!? It's not that im running too new of a PC, that doesnt stop everyone, I got every essential improvement I needed. SIlent Patch, everything, but even with AA off, sure I get a solid 30 FPS, but the tiniest bti of activity on my screen has unresolvable stuttering problems!I didn't even get into the removed songs and features, along with all the work you need to do to get this game into a POSSIBLY playable state. I personally have terrible internet, downloading a 1.3 GB downgrader is annoying. After all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I decided to just get the PS2 version, and if possible, I recommend you do too. Hey, you cant get those pretty mods and graphical stuff...But at least it's playable, and has the San Andreas I've grown to know and love. Grove4life!			"

												Honestly The BEST Grand Theft Auto game ever created! (In My Opinion)I would have more hours on this game but I recently bought this in the Summer of 2016 and transfered my saves over to the steam version.Personally I prefer this map over GTA V's map because it feels A LOT bigger then GTA V although that is only due to the complicated road system that San Andreas had.The Story is pretty good! Takes place in 1992 during the Crack Cocaine epidemic during the 90s and takes real events from the LA Riots and the CRASH Scandle. Although the game seems pretty ghetto, thats only in the VERY beginning and VERY end of the game! I also prefer the gameplay over V's gameplay. Carl is more customizable than Michael, Franklin, or Trevor. As Carl, you can upgrade your skills RPG style like getting stronger or if you want to be a fat man then you can be a fat man or if you want to be some buff guy then you can totally be a buff guy. If you want to learn karate then you can learn karate and use that fight style or if you prefer to be a wrestler then you can be a wrestler! There is also Gun stats which increases your accuracy with a all of your guns unlike GTA V where it just says shooting. In this case to increase your stats for guns, you have to use a gun in the same category(e.g. Pistol/Rifle etc) which increases from gangster to hitman. Also, the more you drive, the more the driving stat goes up making it easier to drive and deducing the percentage of not colliding into other cars/objects(Same goes for bikes and planes).I don't think we need to talk about graphics.One last thing... a few years back, Rockstar made a patch removing songs and deleting old saves. This can all be fixed from downloading a downgrader patch which doesn't only fix the songs but also lets you install mods again.Oh... And One Last Note. Rockstar, you should actually remaster this game! It would be much better than GTA V and make no sense for a GTA VI to come out.			"

												Forget the fact that GTA San Andreas started life as a PlayStation 2 game. The ugly caterpillar has become a beautiful (if foul-mouthed) butterfly. The fifth in a series that since its 2D birth on PC (back in 1997) has celebrated despicable gangsters and drive-by/-thru/-into and -over crime. San Andreas reaches new lows of depraved morality, senseless violence and alpha-male aggression. But it's the fact that it's one of the best games ever made that has already propelled it to console ultra-success.GTA 3 struggled to make the technical leap to PC with its code intact, but months of finger-crossing and animal sacrifices to nameless gods have paid off. San Andreas runs like a dream, with the excellent mouse and keyboard control system of Vice City, extended visual range and atmospheric effects.Like its two more recent predecessors, San Andreas puts you in the shoes of a central character about to embark on a life of crime. However, CJ – aka Carl Johnson – is no career mobster in the mould of Vice City's Tommy Vercetti. In fact, he's been away from the 'hood for five years to try and escape the gang violence endemic in his home city of Los Santos. He's brought back by his mother's untimely death. Hooking up with his brother Sweet and old friends, CJ is inevitably drawn back into the world he had left behind; a world of guns, drugs, territory, casual violence and 'respect'.Respect is actually a measured factor which is raised by performing notorious criminal acts. High respect means you can reinforce CJ with extra gang members when attempting to take over enemy territory. Although, initially, CJ doesn't even get respect from his brother. It's a good system, which draws you further into the game. As you complete missions, you start to gain the grudging respect of those around you. Eventually they adore you. San Andreas is no conventional RPG, but there's a definite feeling of character progression in this game.Or is it an RPG? CJ has several other stats which have subtle but noticeable effects on the game. Driving, cycling, stamina, motorcycling, flying, pistol, rifle... every mode of transport and every type of weapon has an associated skill which increases as you employ it.Better gun skills mean more accuracy with that weapon, while a higher motorbike skill means you won't fall off as easily if you nick a car or lamp-post. There are even scales for fat, muscle and sex appeal, variously dictated by what and how much you eat; your work in the gym; what you wear; your haircut and your tattoos. Some of this is frippery, but it'll also affect whether you can attract girlfriends (and their subsequent side missions), how much damage you withstand (fatties can take more lead, apparently) and some people's responses to you. Like so much in San Andreas, these statistics are carefully woven into the game's structure.If you thought that Vice City's twin islands offered a huge playground, prepare your mind for a boggling. San Andreas offers a whole new world of largeness. There are three cities: Los Santos, a version of Los Angeles and your home town; San Fierro, standing in for San Francisco; and Las Venturas, a dusty, neon-bright Las Vegas squatting in the desert. Not only is each vast in its own right, but the intervening space is expansive and packed. After the first ten hours or so, you're 'encouraged' out of Los Santos and introduced to a world of hicks, country music, tractors and remote, winding roads. The game's sense of place is so distinct that, as black CJ, you actually feel out of place in the small towns that dot the countryside.As you get sucked further into the nefarious scheming of the corrupt cops excellently voiced by Samuel L Jackson and Chris Penn, you're dragged through the rolling countryside and north into San Fierro, all the time meeting and working for bizarre and intriguing characters. With a much more memorable layout than the first city, it's an even more exciting place to be, and you'll be rushing back and forth between the cities too, through the countryside. Throughout the game, the variety of the 100-plus missions never fails to delight. Steal a combine harvester. Infiltrate a secret army base. Chase down thieves on quad bikes. Rob a bank. Shoot down remote-controlled planes with a minigun. Rescue a bunch of stoned English rockers from the desert. Fly a plane to Liberty City to carry out a hit. From the simple to the devilish, from the grimly criminal to the comedic, from the sublime to the ridiculous, San Andreas retains the power to surprise and entertain throughout its lengthy structure.Not just in terms of the missions, either: you'll be infiltrating, burgling, flying, following, swimming, and shooting as a passenger as well as the more usual shooting and driving. My only quibble is that CJ never questions the reasoning behind the hundreds of casualties he's asked to inflict. “Kill that man? Aiight,” sums up his usual response, and at times it's hard to empathise with such a cold-blooded hero.As in the previous two GTA games, you can invest your cash in properties, some of which will provide an income once you've established a business there, and others which just act as new save points. These special locations often require you to complete a series of missions, offering yet another avenue to pursue. At any given time you'll have between one and half a dozen mission paths on offer, for you to take up in any order you want, or ignore completely in favour of a spot of pimping, exploring, police-baiting, male grooming or just riding around.At once a giant, living playground and a smoothly contoured story, San Andreas still manages to be coherent despite giving the player the opportunity to ditch and pick up the storyline at will. The world doesn't have to depend on cutscenes for consistency, because there's always something going on, even if just in the background, to provide colour, life and atmosphere. The radio stations, legendary in GTA 3 and Vice City, are back with a dozen to choose from. As ever, Rockstar's cultural references are spot-on, and anyone older than their mid-20s will be powerfully reminded of their youth with the likes of Public Enemy, Primal Scream and Guns 'N' Roses. The interludes and chat shows are superbly scripted, if not quite as bizarrely hilarious as Vice City's. Again, the PC version enables us to supply MP3s and have them played on a dedicated radio channel.San Andreas does the simple things well. Just stand on any given street, and within seconds you'll see little tableaux developing. Pedestrians bump into each other, pass comments at you and others, and get run over. If you're in an unfriendly 'hood, thugs wearing enemy gang colours will swagger up, offering threats, and eventually attack.Just existing is more gripping than before. Your 'wanted' level is again represented by stars, but here just one star will have the cops shooting and crashing cars like their doughnuts depended on it. Wanted stars are harder to get rid of, and even civilians will react angrily if you nudge their cars. As a result, you can't afford to be too carefree while cruising the streets. This, combined in particular with Los Santos' gritty, often run-down atmosphere, makes the overall experience quite different to Vice City's cartoon world. 'Actions have consequences' seems to be the moral message.That's not to say that San Andreas is humourless: quite the opposite. From the missions and  cutscenes, to incidental dialogue and even tiny signs in obscure shops, you'll see Rockstar's trademark comedy style, ranging from the juvenile to the very explicit. San Andreas isn't afraid to say anything. Minor graphical scars left from its painful transformation into a PC game do nothing to dull San Andreas' inner beauty. The best of the series, and already a contender for game of the year.			"

												This game is literally my entire childhood. I have so many great memories from this game so I cannot say anything bad about it. Yes it's old but so is Half-Life: you don't need to look at the graphics to define a good game and this is truly the best Grand Theft Auto out there. Grand Theft Auto V is a very good game and one of my favorites also but I cannot put that before this game because of the memories.Seriously, try this game and just don't concentrate on the graphics, then you will appreciate how good it is. This game was way ahead of it's time.			"

												After hours of gameplay, I'm saying that NO you should not buy this game!Here's some reason.Rockstar completly abandonned this game,I don't care about the 12 or so song that got removed but they know that the game have A LOT of issue and still no fix since Vanilla version.Those who speedrun this game must be some god or something like that,the game is random with surprise which is cool.But the BUGS the GLITCHES are going to get you insane,I tried to finish this game without *cheats* I got to the second last mission,then boom ceaser can't move and any other gang member too. I had to pickup ceaser in a car and make the gang everywhere cheats.... I can't stand this game anymore.There's this thing some people call boostocops,spacecops. Which in resume say that Cops AI is Dumb but way too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that you can get busted if you drive your car and bam a police car spawn over your head,BUSTED.I died more than 15 times byyyyy jumping! Hell yea!play this game for fun,not for the story.Oh did I say that you can't beat all mission at 60fps, *what do you mean*? You can't swim,you can't drive,you can't fly proprely if the frame limiter is off and some mission LITTERALY DESPAWN the ones that you need to protect!100% Bug freePs:I know this game isn'T made for Windows 7...

After the first ten hours or so, you're 'encouraged' out of Los Santos and introduced to a world of hicks, country music, tractors and remote, winding roads. The game's sense of place is so distinct that, as black CJ, you actually feel out of place in the small towns that dot the countryside.As you get sucked further into the nefarious scheming of the corrupt cops excellently voiced by Samuel L Jackson and Chris Penn, you're dragged through the rolling countryside and north into San Fierro, all the time meeting and working for bizarre and intriguing characters. With a much more memorable layout than the first city, it's an even more exciting place to be, and you'll be rushing back and forth between the cities too, through the countryside. Throughout the game, the variety of the 100-plus missions never fails to delight. Steal a combine harvester. Infiltrate a secret army base. Chase down thieves on quad bikes. Rob a bank. Shoot down remote-controlled planes with a minigun. Rescue a bunch of stoned English rockers from the desert. Fly a plane to Liberty City to carry out a hit. From the simple to the devilish, from the grimly criminal to the comedic, from the sublime to the ridiculous, San Andreas retains the power to surprise and entertain throughout its lengthy structure.Not just in terms of the missions, either: you'll be infiltrating, burgling, flying, following, swimming, and shooting as a passenger as well as the more usual shooting and driving. My only quibble is that CJ never questions the reasoning behind the hundreds of casualties he's asked to inflict. “Kill that man? Aiight,” sums up his usual response, and at times it's hard to empathise with such a cold-blooded hero.As in the previous two GTA games, you can invest your cash in properties, some of which will provide an income once you've established a business there, and others which just act as new save points. These special locations often require you to complete a series of missions, offering yet another avenue to pursue. At any given time you'll have between one and half a dozen mission paths on offer, for you to take up in any order you want, or ignore completely in favour of a spot of pimping, exploring, police-baiting, male grooming or just riding around.At once a giant, living playground and a smoothly contoured story, San Andreas still manages to be coherent despite giving the player the opportunity to ditch and pick up the storyline at will. The world doesn't have to depend on cutscenes for consistency, because there's always something going on, even if just in the background, to provide colour, life and atmosphere. The radio stations, legendary in GTA 3 and Vice City, are back with a dozen to choose from. As ever, Rockstar's cultural references are spot-on, and anyone older than their mid-20s will be powerfully reminded of their youth with the likes of Public Enemy, Primal Scream and Guns 'N' Roses. The interludes and chat shows are superbly scripted, if not quite as bizarrely hilarious as Vice City's. Again, the PC version enables us to supply MP3s and have them played on a dedicated radio channel.San Andreas does the simple things well. Just stand on any given street, and within seconds you'll see little tableaux developing. Pedestrians bump into each other, pass comments at you and others, and get run over. If you're in an unfriendly 'hood, thugs wearing enemy gang colours will swagger up, offering threats, and eventually attack.Just existing is more gripping than before. Your 'wanted' level is again represented by stars, but here just one star will have the cops shooting and crashing cars like their doughnuts depended on it. Wanted stars are harder to get rid of, and even civilians will react angrily if you nudge their cars. As a result, you can't afford to be too carefree while cruising the streets. This, combined in particular with Los Santos' gritty, often run-down atmosphere, makes the overall experience quite different to Vice City's cartoon world. 'Actions have consequences' seems to be the moral message.That's not to say that San Andreas is humourless: quite the opposite. From the missions and  cutscenes, to incidental dialogue and even tiny signs in obscure shops, you'll see Rockstar's trademark comedy style, ranging from the juvenile to the very explicit. San Andreas isn't afraid to say anything. Minor graphical scars left from its painful transformation into a PC game do nothing to dull San Andreas' inner beauty. The best of the series, and already a contender for game of the year.			"

												My friend says this is the best of the series, and while I think Vice City has the slight edge, San Andreas is a very fun game.  By today's bleeding edge standards the graphics may be a little dated, and the acting is a little over the top, but the gameplay is rock solid.If you've never played an open world adventure game, give this a try.  It's far cheaper than the newest incarnation (GTA V) and while it may be missing a few bells and whistles, it'll remain a 'return-to' classic.			"

The graphic of SA tbh it's not great (consider it's 2005 i won't complain about it)So i try it and this is my reviewPros, Cons and TL;DR (At the bottom) Pros Great Open World with a lot of mysteries and Easter EggsGood story as far as i goesAddicting afSupport joypad (i only know it support X360 Controller)In-game CheatsAddicted with Gym, Teritories, Silent approach stab people with a knife, and Killing people with a silencer pistol Cons New patch 3.0 removed 18 Songs and 1080p supportIf you want to fly a plane you need practice and i mean MASTER IT!No taxi (If you want to use taxi buy GTA IV and above or mod it)The game crash a lotThe animation is somehow annoyingThings like some people ram my vehicle with his/her vehicle for no reason and the worst part it won't stops until you kill themThe vehicle can damaged quite easilyChanging button can help you a lot in this game TL;DR Great game for people with 64 MB VRAM (Intel Chipset mostly), Open World and mysterious easter eggs, great story and it feels big than GTA VNotes: Google for the 1.0 Patch.

The version of the game that is sold on Steam, is different from other versions that were released. For example, some textures and radio songs are removed, and the game is completely unmoddable.

												I would definitely recommend this game. For something that came out in 2005, it's still a really good game. The story is good, and it actually has people still playing the game daily - especially with the multiplayer mods roaming around. The roleplay servers on the mods are about the only ones you can go to if you want to play a RP set in the 21st century.So yes, I recommend it. It's a really nice game. If you get bored with the singleplayer, install SA-MP or something. You (hopefully) won't regret it.			"

If it wasn't for SAMP i probably wouldn't be here reviewing this game because the fact is, I learnt about Steam from a user on SAMP.The Single Player is really Fast-Paced and exciting as you would expect from any GTA Game, Now that i think about it everything in this game is exciting, Even the ♥♥♥♥♥♥. :DI would always recommend this game and i doubt my decision would change, Everything in this game is perfect.10/10			"

												Oh man. What an amazing game this is. Yea, the graphics might feel a bit dated, but the size of the map, the mechanics, the humor are all a basis for the success that GTA V is. The soundtrack alone makes this game a best buy. Faith No More, GunsNRoses, NWA... so many early 90s classics. Its just a fun experience that doesn't take itself too seriously. I had a blast playing this on Xbox (the origial) and its great having this in my library to revisit when I want on my PC. Highly recommended.			"

												IMO, this is slightly better and I mean SLIGHTLY better than GTA 5. An actual character upgrade system, better gang wars, a gang recruiting system, a better super kickass soundtrack, more cities, more accessible buildings, funnier characters, more story missions, mods that won't get you banned and NO STUPID SOCIAL CLUB CRAP TO RESTRICT GAMEPLAY. I just find it awesome that an 11 year old game still manages to be a true masterpiece when compared to it's successors. Don't get me wrong, I love GTA 5 (4 is alright) and both 4 and 5 has advantages over San Andreas, but they are slightly edged out by San Andreas in my book. Also, mods. That is all.			"

												I had played this game originally when it came out in 2004. For some reason I abandoned it without finishing the main campaign, or doing any of the side missions. More than 10 years later, with some luck getting it running on modern computers I was able to replay a game which I now consider the best open world game made. Closing in on almost 100% completion, I try to think of the other GTA games I've played and for some reason they don't compare to the fun I've had in San Andreas. Just the sheer amount of things to interact with, missions, side quests, hidden quests, safe houses, business assests, driving schools, races. The fact that you can gain more skills in driving cars, bicycles, motorcycles, boats, planes, increase your muscles, stamina, health. The amount of it is staggering to me looking back at a 10 year old game. To top off the content San Andreas offers you, there is the obvious GTA universe over the top mayhem and destruction to look forward to. The main campaign is pretty great, and will take you from a young busta living in the ghetto on grove street, to a multimillionaire with legitimate business assests and fantastic mansions. CJ is a really fun character to play, and he surrounds himself with a great supporting cast with lots of high quality voice actors. This is seriously one of the best open world games made, and easily in the top 5 of my favorite games.			"

												This game was my ""childhood"" even though I had the fortune of playing it when I was grow enough to understand it. I literally learned english (its not my native language) with it, and the first run was SO good. For that time the map was huge and fun to explore, the interactions seemed to be infinite and gameplay/storyline a continuous surprise and no videogame in my past as a gamer felf so ALIVE as the world of GTA SA. As a kid, this game left me enamoured with the american west coast, the 90s, and their music (despite being based in a fictional universe). Maybe now, with the eyes of an adult person and after 11 years from it's first release I see this game less deep than before, as the plot isn't really a masterpiece and the game certanly doesnt give the same sensation of freedom a modern and well made free roaming game would give.However, those good memories and sensations are still there (including the trill of looking for Bigfoot in game, even though it was revealed to be a hoax xD) , and they truly make me think this was the best GTA ever made. So even if the graphics/cutscenes are not comparable to a modern product, I HIGHLY recomend it, I believe it can still give you those things.			"

												This is a great classic game. Unfortunately this PC version doesn't work with a control pad or it's unplayable at least as you can't adjust the camera angle when on foot.			"

												The unbelievable latest patch (November 2014) it deletes everything and cause several problems with save games, etc.Be careful if you want the original SA. I recommend first, if you really want this don't buy it or buy it and do a downgrade instantly. Othewise I can't recommend this game, not this version.			"

												While the PC port of the game is kind of bad, this game is still gold. The only problems I have are glitches with the frame limiter, and the really bad controls. But, the story's great, the side-characters are memorable, and the environment is huge and endless. I'd only buy it if you are a strict PC gamer, or if you wanted to download mods.			"

												I had played this game originally when it came out in 2004. For some reason I abandoned it without finishing the main campaign, or doing any of the side missions. More than 10 years later, with some luck getting it running on modern computers I was able to replay a game which I now consider the best open world game made. Closing in on almost 100% completion, I try to think of the other GTA games I've played and for some reason they don't compare to the fun I've had in San Andreas. Just the sheer amount of things to interact with, missions, side quests, hidden quests, safe houses, business assests, driving schools, races. The fact that you can gain more skills in driving cars, bicycles, motorcycles, boats, planes, increase your muscles, stamina, health. The amount of it is staggering to me looking back at a 10 year old game. To top off the content San Andreas offers you, there is the obvious GTA universe over the top mayhem and destruction to look forward to. The main campaign is pretty great, and will take you from a young busta living in the ghetto on grove street, to a multimillionaire with legitimate business assests and fantastic mansions. CJ is a really fun character to play, and he surrounds himself with a great supporting cast with lots of high quality voice actors. This is seriously one of the best open world games made, and easily in the top 5 of my favorite games.			"

												Everyone is ♥♥♥♥♥ing about the update that removes some music or whatever... listen to be honest it really doesn't impact the game that much (hell i don't even listen to those songs anyway i just import my own music in the custom radio channel) i bought it and was expecting terribleness as everyone in the review section has been ripping it to threads... but if you are looking to revisit a classic game there really isn't anything stopping you. The recent update isn't GAME BREAKING as some over the top players may put it. Sure there's a few less features but from a gameplay perspective it's pretty much the exact same game it was before. definitely worth a buy.			"
