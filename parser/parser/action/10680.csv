												People say the game is mediocre, and perhaps that is justified. However, I feel the game is at least in the higher end of mediocre games, and can produce a lot of fun. At least for fans of the different creatures the game tried (and in my opinion, succeeded) to bring alive.I am not in a position to review the multiplayer so consider this to be mainly a single player review.People are usually concerned with the duration of gameplay, and what many have said is true, it's short, with the marine campaign being the longest, Predator in the middle and the alien the shortest. It's a shame, as I found that the alien was the most fun, then the predator, and lastly the marine. Though this is not to say that it isn't fun to play the marine, it's just the weakest of the species. All three species campaigns adding up to perhaps 12h, though I might be slow - spending a lot of time in the shadows as an alien, watching how the marines patrol, and cloaked as a predator, deciding which marine to pick off first.What this game has that the earlier AVP games didn't have, was a more polished experience as the different species: Aliens feel like more than just a floating camera with floating arms and a tail that shows up every so often. Now you move as your body moves, you can feel with every turn of the camera as your playable xenomorph changes position and sometimes the tail shows up when you turn around fast enough. The way you can leap, look, attack, all are improvements to a first-person-shooter experience of sneaking or leaping and attacking in close quarters, always in the same brutal sense you pick up from the films.Predators too feel like they move, behave and look like a predator from the movies. There's nothing like re-enacting a scene so reminiscent from the films: Leap up a tree cloaked, observe the marines below, say you want the smart gunner first, you distract the marine with some distorted human cry, wait for them to get closer, then leap (focus+attack1) on them and pick a trophy.And that brings me to the full-body awareness. It's a small feature, but I still value it when developers pick up on the little things which can mean a lot to make an experience feel just right. the trophy kills and stealth kills seem to have been the baby of the project to hammer out a smooth way to behave with the character, with little distracting buggy animations, if any at all, just going up to a human and impaling them with your tail, literally, or just stabbing an alien with your wristblades, lifting them up in the air, seeing the dangling xeno giving its last painful shriek, then becoming motionless, and you, the predator, just casting it aside.The story isn't anything new or particularly gripping, but it's okay, and what you could expect, though the AVP2 game had a better story, this game has a better story than the avp movies, so there's that.If only they'd extended the Predator and Alien campaigns, I think the game would have gained more popularity. Also, since the games are trying to be close to the movies, I think it's time to make the ""marine"" human character female, if you want to copy some of the defining features of the films. Which isn't bad, just saying.Graphics do justice to the details of the predators and their swinging dreadlocks, and the shining, slimey aliens, coupled with great animations, which you can admire both while hunting the different species and while playing them, made it a fun experience.Personally the game didn't suffer from issues (and I have a mediocre laptop, win7, intel dual core 2ghz, 4gRAM, graphics card shares its memory with ram, only 64mb dedicated), only a flickering mouse in the mainmenu. I'm mentioning this because I've seen so many games suffer from multiple bugs, though often repairable, this didn't really have any issues for me.Lack of survivor maps as a predator or alien felt like the greatest sorrows of missed opportunities for this game (which I think could have been very feasible additions, as I write in a post on the forums of the game here on steam).

												Aliens vs. Predator is a first-person shooter, released in early 2010 and has almost one million owners on the PC alone. There are three campaigns in this game, one for each character/creature - the Predators, Aliens and Marines. All three of the campaigns have their own individual story line, but all link together in the main story plot.  Each campaign puts you in control of a different race. The Predator is a stealthy, agile race, allowing you to stalk your prey from the tree tops and sneaking around the back of enemies. You also have different vision modes, which will seek out the other races very easily. Each different vision mode however will make the other class invisible. Aliens are able to see through the predators cloaking device while the marines are able to gun down a predator with ease. Aliens, which was by far my favorite race to play as, pushes you to fight in close-quarters with claws, teeth and tails. You have the ability to climb on walls and jump long distances. You can stalk in the shadows and pounce on an unsuspecting enemy. The Marine campaign is that far more standard to a first-person shooter. You are able to carry your pistol along with two other firearms, ranging from shotguns to pulse rifles.  To help you work your way around, you are equipped with a torch, flares and motion trackers.The graphics are nice; even though this game is a couple of years old now, it still stands the test of time. There are the odd time when you can tell its five years old, but you can't really complain that much as this is easily one of the better looking games from that year. The swamps and forest are lush of greenery, while the alien hives are also very pleasing to look at. As with all horror games, the audio in Aliens vs Predator is top notch. Any sudden change in music will get your heart racing, but like all jump scare games, once you start to get used to them and the way they happen, they soon don't effect you at all and are able to just take them in your stride. Once you hit about three quarters of the way through, any horror aspect is lost sadly. Voice acting is very well done here too - all of the main characters are voiced, granted the only campaign with much voice acting is the marines, but you still get bits here and there in the other missions. I played this on Normal difficulty; and didn't really have any problems - the only one which stands out for me is on the Alien mission when you have to climb through an air tunnel; this took me a while to work out how to progress and had to result to Youtube in the end. Other than that, there are no real hard points to be found, all objectives are clearly marked along with a way-point system arrow that points you in the right direction all of the time. Playing all three campaigns on a normal difficulty; I was able to finish Aliens Vs Predator in just under six hours. You can replay the missions on a higher difficulty for an achievement if that is your thing; but once you play it through once, there isn't really any other reason to play it again. The multiplayer scene here is also pretty barren too; so you are really paying just for the single player story.  For me, I am happy with the regular price of Â£9,99 for this title. This is really well put together game, all of the gameplay and story elements are very well presented. It does the franchise justice and fans of the series will love it. I wholeheartedly recommend Aliens vs Predator. If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Let's start with the fact that the campaign is quite challenging but short. Each possible for us to play ""race"" has own climate. As a Marine it is really part of panic and fear accompanied by elements of horror by exploring the dark corridors filled to the brim with aliens, using a crappy flashlight. A lot of difficult things to do that keep us on the edge. As the Predator, I must admit that at the beginning I had a problem with a huge amount of control, which allowed us to hunt this creature, but it was very rewarding when it started to pretend. And the game as Alien, or so-called Xenomorph was really an interesting experience, walking on the walls, stalking the ventilation shafts, killing groups of people or fight against predators. The graphics in this game is well made, has own charm. I would absolutely recommend this game to everyone regardless of whether you're a fan of the series or not. The only sad thing for me in this game is that such a small number of people playing multiplayer.			"

												REVIVE THE MULTIPLAYER COMMUNITY!This game is really under rated, and there is only a few servers with alot of people in them. If you were crying in disapointment from colonial marines, buy this, it's great! Most will buy this for the multiplayer, but the campaign is pretty good. The marine campaign is great with it's dark theme, at times ammo can be TOO plentiful, if it was a bit more resident evil style survival horror it would be amazing. The alien campaign is fun in general, pretty good. Predator campaign is great as well, maybe a bit easy except for not knowing where to go once or twice.7/10Highly above averageIf you are a fan of the alien films or games, buy it now!			"

												Significantly better than that trash Aliens: Colonial Marines.Warning: Multiplayer's kinda dead, though not surprising considering it's been 5 years since its release; its death can also be attributed to the fact that the multiplayer isn't exactly the most balanced and it takes almost no skill to play as an Alien or a Predator (Just spam Heavy Attack or Plasma Caster gg no re) -- with the exception of Marines, the only race of the game that actually requires skill.TL;DR: Do not buy the game if your reason is to get a multiplayer experience.

												This is the 2010 first person shooter video game release based on the Fox movie franchises, Aliens, Predator and Aliens vs Predator. There is a highly acclaimed Aliens vs Predator game already. This is not a remake of that game, but an all new installment with an original (brief) story.Aliens vs Predator is broken up into three campaigns (it has multiplayer games as well). One campaign you play as the Xenomorph aliens, another you play as the Predator and a third played as a human space marine sent in to combat the two. Each species / character (Predator, Xenomorph, space marine) plays differently. Space marines play like traditional first person shooters, Xenomorphs can climb on the walls and ceilings and use stealth to drop down and kill enemies because they die VERY easily and Predators use a combination of the two. They can jump far distances, stealth kill and change their vision to see in different ways.As a space marine, there are a few good and useful weapon types, shotgun, pulse rifle, pistol, flame thrower and more. You can carry three weapons at a time, which feels like enough. Shooting as the space marine feels very imprecise, because you can barely see your crosshairs, the enemies move quick and most of the time, you're shooting at black Xenomorphs on dark walls. The game makes use of light and shadows, because it gives you a flashlight and flares. Both the flashlight and flares are limitless and it felt like there should be sparing usage of both. The flashlight can flicker or go out a few seconds. Your enemy radar can cut out for a moment.Movement and mouse aim feel clunky, slow and sluggish. At least there is a run button for a few moments of speed when running down straight corridors. Speaking of the run button, a lot of times it feels like I can just run through from the enemies instead of dealing with them.There are in your face moments when you need to melee enemies to get them out of your face. Xenomorphs will pounce on you, face huggers will jump in your face, but not so much that it gets annoying like in other games. You even have some cool melee kills that you can use.Enemy AI and variety is good, Xenomorphs effortlessly crawl everywhere, they can turn in circles on walls, ceilings, nooks, crannies and eves. Face huggers will avoid your crosshairs, Predators will sniper you and even big lumbering android soldiers take some aim to kill. None of the enemies feel particularly deadly or powerful... just difficult to shoot when compared to other games.The game sets a great atmosphere that is diverse from section to section. The Xenomorph areas are dark, futuristic and gritty, while the Predator jungles are a foreboding, luscious beauty with a sense of something watching you. The music is good and all background music matches the area.The only big gripe is the fact that there are level conclusions. The level ends and you are sent to a screen with your score and where to save or continue. This really breaks immersion especially when the next level takes place the moment the last level ended. This should have been made into a seamless transition with no halt in the action. The score could have been shown on screen, auto saved (which the game does autosave) and keep the action going. Even playing audio logs is cumbersome and could have been done much better instead of having to pause the game... find the audio log and then return to the action. There are better ways to do that without taking yourself out of the action. Apparently there are audio logs (and other tedious collectables), it is a shame that system is so cumbersome that I don't care to listen.There are voices in your head telling you what to do, however they don't sound all that believable for the situation you're supposed to be in. It is like they are too pleasant for a situation that has dozens dying. But perhaps having someone barking orders and yelling at you might not be the best to stay focused.The objectives are pretty simple and its rinse wash repeat. Go here... clear a wave of enemies... open this door... find the power supply and bring it to a door so you can open it and go through. The level design offers a nice path... going upstairs and downstairs, and weaves around areas, but it is all one way with little chance of getting lost. The game is painfully short with the marine campaign being the longest and taking around 3 hours to complete the first time. It feels more like the campaigns are to teach you everything for multiplayer.In conclusion, there are better first person shooters out there more worthy of your time, but if you are a big fan of the franchise, you can pick the game up for $5 or cheaper and have hours of fun with it. I keep thinking of ways this game could have been better, such as more variety with what to do. Sentries you can put up yourself. More friendlies to fight along side. A crouch button to crawl through air ducts. More secrets or exploration, because it feels like the game has zero secrets. More situations that require stealth or thought instead of running to fights or from fights. Light and BRIEF turret and or driving sections (Aliens movie had a driving section). Maybe for the sequel...			"

												So throughout I only played as Predator which required a lot of micro management regarding his kit. It was less disorienting as an Alien who could climb on walls and ceilings. Playing as a Marine was fun but they threw in a weapon that had aimbot assist.The Aliens were fast and could move faster if you wanted to. Predators can use stealth as well as the ability to kill from a distance with mounted laser or javelin.Cons - You could just know where the Predator perks spawned and just camped in those places. Group hug so Aliens cannot attack, but grouping up against Predator was just a simple job of throwing javelin or using mounted laser to kill Marines.Nice game modes - FFA, Species DM, and personal favorite was Marines vs Predator but not as forgiving as it was a timed mode so you had to attack and not wait. Also a few maps to that showed variety.Recommend this on sale and with friends.			"

												Isolation, vulnerability, dreadâ¦ Not only does it cover the basic survival-horror elements, it also applies to what made Aliens vs. Predator such an undeniable hit in 1999. Although Rebellion decidedly never attempted to elevate the element of story-telling, providing a coherent plot rather than a series of detached levels, it was the superb level design, terrific environments and effective lightning coupled with relentless dread that reinforced an already satisfied gameplay in a believable setting that through implicit presentation was faithful to the famous movie franchises.The sequel by Monolith, however, expanded and surpassed the original by far and the release of Aliens vs. Predator 2 turned out to be one of the best (shooter) games of 2001. The three compelling campaigns that not only took place simultaneously but also intersected at certain points were just as distinguished as the complex underlying structure of the story. Truly capturing the essence of a faithful Alien and Predator movie, the careful attention to detail and coherence against the elegant script was outermost outstanding. The frequent use of engaging voice-overs and excellent music only strengthened the overall impression that Aliens vs. Predator 2 very much unfolded like a great movie. Furthermore, all campaigns were just as terrific and consistent, with the exception of the marine that, by obvious reasons, kept most of the first-rate suspense intact and exceeded the gameâs ability.The return of Rebellion, however, is questionable regarding inconsistency, gameplay issues and uninspiring plot. Out of three campaigns, one is solid, the second mediocre and the third bad. Since there is a sense of story attached to at least one of them, the marine is the given highlight.  Dark, moody and overall good-looking surroundings, presenting a loyal (yet pretty much recycled) audio direction and amazing music, is a fairly good start. Besides, decently dramatic voice-acting (somewhat ruined by poor dialogue) and a sweet return of veteran actor Lance âBishopâ Henriksen are always considered strength.There are a few decent levels of solid tension and the occasional sequences of narrative, but the lack of dread is remarkable and the brutal violence, although spectacularly atrocious to witness, does rarely compensate the absence of fear and substance. The straight forward story of the marine suffers from routine-like clichÃ©s without finesse and is mediocre at best, and it only goes downhill in the remaining campaigns. If predator has a less intriguing part except being a pretty much pointless hunter, then the aimless alien is utterly useless.Although not as prominent, mediocrity also applies to a quite linear level design as well as inconsistent AI. Sudden, inexplicable limitations tend to appear in the surroundings for no apparent reason and stagnated civilians prefer to be killed rather than escaping. The mention of awkward controls seems inevitable too. While the marine campaign works fine, the command of both predator and alien feels clumsy and uneven at times, causing unnecessary retries (advising not to play on hard difficulty unless having a great patienceâ¦), but being a magnificent creature might suppose to be that harsh.The striking brilliance of Monolithâs masterpiece is hardly recaptured in Rebellionâs addition, despite good intention in an actual overall decent presentation. Certainly too much mediocrity and too few substantial shortcomings cannot become as classy and characteristic, but lesser cons ultimately means more pros. And yes, last yearâs Aliens: Colonial Marines definitely had more cons than pros.6,5 / 10			"

												This game is awesome. Let me tell you what I do think of it-> PROS+The gameplay is very fluent with many sound effects which makes your experience feel that you were there and you were actually fighting those â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es :D+The graphics are decent+There aren't game breaking bugs :)+The multiplayer is just simply awesome. Everyone who says it is dead it is WRONG. Everytime I find like 4 servers full of players. Now, let me tell you the servers slots: 18/18 16/16 12/12 and i think 10/10 (which means that there are like +50 palyers everytime playing which is really good).+The stories are well built, especially for the marine. Around 15 hours on your first story completition on Normal difficulty.(Marine+Alien+Predator, so the campaign itself is short).+The game itself is complex and it will take some time to master the race you want to play. When you will do that, it will be just awesome.+In multiplayer you got ranks. Once you advance in ranks, you get skins. +The classes/races are well balanced. Don't think that a predator can easily kill a marine. or opposite. It depends on your skill with every class and the weapons you pickup on the road :) Sometimes it matters the map too. For example , Refinery is a perfect map for an alien.+There are many game mods: Deathmatch/Species Deathmatch/Mixed Species Deathmatch , Domination, Infestation, Predator Hunt and Survivor. The DLCs include some survivor maps, so it should be a must buy if you want to play survivor. -> CONS-The game is not recieving support from their developers because the game is old. So do not expect to report a bug and find it fixed. The game will remain as it is.- Even though the multiplayer has enough matches to play good, the modes you will find there will be mostly played by the players in the following order: Species DM, Mixed Species DM, Infestation, DM, Predator Hunt. You will surely find servers into these modes. But the rest, much harder. You need some friends if you want to play Domination or something. If you are lucky enough you can join an empty domination or what gamemode you want and someone joines you and then the server will grow in population. Happened that to me a few times-Only 5 maps to play. If you want more, you need to get the DLCs too. The problem is, the DLCs maps are not being played. You need friends if you want to play MP on the DLCs maps.-> CONLUSIONInspite it's cons, the game is mostly perfect. A little of updates in the future and the game will be just fine(even tho this will not happen). Another sad part is that the game is very underrated by many players. Trust me, the game is good.My opinion? Buy this game, but not with the DLCs. If the game is on sale, then buy with the DLCs and find some friends to play with.I am strongly recommanding this game to everyone.-> RATING : 8,5/10			"

												If you were burned or disappointed by Aliens: Colonial Marines, then I'd highly suggest picking up a copy of this game. Aliens vs Predator is a solid, polished shooter reminiscent of the original game from 1999, and is guaranteed to thrill and surprise you.The player experiences three different campaigns; predator, alien and marine. Each campaign has a different playing style, and I'm very impressed by the way Rebellion has managed to polish each style so efficiently.Firstly, the marine campaign. Probably the best of the three, you use classic weapons from the Alien films and comic books such as the pulse rifle, smartgun and double barrelled shotgun. The shooting is surprisingly tight, and you'll get into a nice rhythm of blasting and reloading. The darker levels are great at creating suspense, and the xenomorph models are beautifully animated. They take you by surprise and can swarm you very quickly, which creates moments of panic that I haven't felt in a shooter for a long, long time. You also fight other enemies like Weyland Yutani androids, who are unsettling in their own way (probably those creepy voice recordings and expressionless faces). You can also experience classic movie moments like blasting the Alien Queen out of her egg sac, which is awesome to just about anyone who has seen Aliens.Secondly, the predator campaign. As the Predator, you'll attempt to stay stealthy and pick off enemies using the range of tools at your disposal. You have a plasma caster, a spear, throwing discs and of course, the classic wrist blades. Much like the Batman: Arkham games, you'll navigate high vantage points and isolate enemies with x-ray vision until you are able to safely dispatch them. However, the game will also make you fight Aliens in close combat, which is frustrating and clunky; this consists of repeatedly mashing buttons while aliens continuously leap at you, which makes for a frustrating experience. Also, while the execution animations are quite awesome, they also take a long time to complete and make you vulnerable to damage, which is extremely annoying on harder difficulties.Finally, the alien campaign. Playing as the alien also focuses on stealth, and you'll climb over different surfaces while attacking with your claws, teeth and tail. The wall climbing mechanics mostly work, though they can be confusing and hard to use at times. The constant movement of the alien is also quite dizzying, and is especially noticeable when traversing the inside of buildings. Whilst this campaign is still fun in its own right, the confusing wall-climbing and lack of interesting attacks means that this campaign is the least interesting of the three.The game looks fantastic visually, but all three campaigns take place in the same location, so it can get quite repetitive due to the re-used locations. Despite this, it is fun to see where the other species has gone after completing each campaign. For example, when playing as the Predator, there is a level where you find the dead Alien Queen after the Marine segment where you kill the Queen yourself.Overall, Aliens vs Predator is an awesome game that doesn't disappoint. The three entertaining campaigns are immensely satisfying, despite odd design choices and irritating game mechanics. 8 / 10			"

												Better at being Colonial Marines than Colonial Marines was. A great game with 3 campaigns (and 3 perspectives) to choose from. Lovely visuals, decent graphics and some neat gameplay mechanics combine into a well-rounded and solid shooter set in the Aliens and Predator universe.Jimbo Rating: 7/10			"

												A beautiful edition to the AVP franchice, with unfortunately some big flaws, so let me count the ways. But before poking at each individual race. here some universal things that are bad across the game. 1. Repetitive levels: each campaign seems to copy and paste the levels. Soooo you basicly just play the game 3 times with each race2. Combat: Alien and Predator have to play rock-paper-scissors when they melee fight... wtf.Marine Campaign: is boring and long, I wish there were more guns like previous installments, and that life bar bothers me... its like have hearts in zelda I just cant take it seriously in this game.Alien Campaign: is so much fun but, way to short (messing with AI's is the best thing ever)Predator Campaign: fun but story line wise doesnt really feel relevent (as with most AVP Predator campaigns). and like the marine, Predator has a very tiny weapon beltBUT!!! overall i got one of the best (and prettiest) Alien expereinces ever 7/10			"

												Well, I've got my flashlight ON the entire time, I can't possibly have enough flares, I'm always low on ammo, it's dark, creepy, and I'm sweatin' it out fighting like mad for my life because ""they're comin' out the walls, man!  They're comin' out of the godd@mn walls!""  So, yeah, it's nothing groundbreaking as far as the story goes...but it's Aliens to a T!  Nice graphics, furious action, fun and worth the money, in my opinion, especially if you're a fan of the franchise.			"

												I picked this up for about $5 wanting a shooter set in the Aliens universe (that isn't Colonial Marines).  At first it felt a little clunky and cheap but once I got used to the feel of it I found it to be relatively immersive and I ended up enjoying it quite a bit!The graphics and audio are reasonable for a 2010 game and they hold up fairly well in my opinion.There are 3 single player campaigns: Marine, Predator & Alien.  I played them all in that order and found each one to be unique and entertaining.  I completed all 3 campaigns in 7-8 hours total.The game isn't so immersive that you'll force yourself to stay up late playing it but it's definitely worth at least one playthrough through each of the campaigns.  This is an area where the short length of the campaigns may have been a benefit, because if it were any longer it may have become monotonous and tedious to complete.Marine CampaignThe marine campaign was what I was mostly looking for and I was satisfied with it.  You start with a semi-auto pistol with a burst option and an assault rifle that sounds just like the ones from the movies.  Eventually you pick up a pretty sweet shotgun, a heavy machine gun, a flamethrower and a scoped rifle.Predator CampaignThe predator is a lot of fun to play as, definitely overpowered - as it should be.  You get a lot of tactical options here, including stealth, melee attacks, a throwing spear, a 'smart disc', proximity mines and of course the shoulder cannon.  You can even use auditory distractions to lure marines, just like in the movies.  There is also a very cool and intuitive method for making huge leaps from location to location and 3 different vision modes you can cycle through to better see humans or aliens.Alien CampaignI really didn't know what to expect from the alien campaign but was pleasantly surprised with how unique it was.  You can walk/run on just about any surface and move through ducts.  As an alternative to executing enemies, you can harvest them which means you hold them down while a facehugger comes out of nowhere and latches onto their face.  The NPC's reactions when you do this are pretty unnerving honestly, and each time I did it kind of made me a little sick.  You can also hiss to lure enemies closer, or just because.MultiplayerI have not tried multiplayer - I would if there were a pure coop mode vs AI.			"

												Marine:This game easily recaptures the panic and fear of maneuvering through dark halls with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ lighting and unexpected aliens. Lots of things to shoot and challenging enough to keep you on your edge.Predator:I'll admit I was a little overwhelmed at first with the amount of controls and means of completing a level but felt very satisfied overall with the experience of playing as a predator.Alien:I felt slightly underpowered and a little defenseless on several occasions while playing as the Xenomorph but overall the whole game is quite pleasant and a decent experience.Good looking game, good use of character models and not too too demanding. Controls are decent, overall, a decent AVP game, although dedicated servers would probably have made the multiplayer a lot more enjoyable like AVP 2000. 8/10.			"

 Aliens Vs Predator (2010). âIf it bleeds we can kill itâThe Aliens and Predator franchises have had there ups downs, and when combined into films it was the ladder. In gaming however they really worked! Starting back in the Arcade as a âFinal Fightâ style beat-em up, the Atari Jaguar in 1994, the PC version in 2000, and a sequel in 2004. All were fun games for their time. So how does the latest in the series hold up? Well it helps if your a fan of Alien, and The Predator movies, and I am so my review may be biased. The game is broken into three campaigns that tie in the main story. Players can choose a Colonial Marine, the Alien, or The Predator. Each class plays very unique with their own abilities. The Marine campaign was my favorite, it captures some of the Aliens feel. There is a great line-up of movie weapons, tense scenes, and a lot of action. My complaints for the Marine are minor. I really wish they added âAim Down Sitesâ. Firing from the hip in gaming is just old school, I need my sites! Second complaint is the motion tracker, It's all but useless in the game. I know I'll get some heat for saying this, but Aliens Colonial Marines made far better use of the motion tracker.  My second favorite campaign was The Predator. With all of his tools at your disposal, you will feel like an unstoppable hunter. My only complaint on The Predator is the âpred jumpâ. At times it can be a pain to line up, but once you know the map its less frustrating. The Aliens campaign was my least favorite. The Alien can transition to walls, and run in 3D. It has some interesting fatalities, and is extremely fast. However This is extremely disorientating in first person view, and I can't tell you how many times I ran right by an enemy because of the speed the Alien runs at. This could have been easily fixed if the Alien had 3rd person perspective. The game offers a decent amount of multiplayer modes, and a decent number of maps. The only thing I wish is there was a little more variety in the scenery. Your either in a Jungle, or a pyramid, and thatâs about it.  The game will run on almost any PC if you adjust the resolution, and graphics options (Not your Apple II, but anything from 2010 and up should be fine). Overall this game despite its flaws is a very fun play, and I recommend it. If you've been passing on this one, and your a fan of either franchise you should pick it up. You can typically find it during a Steam sale for $5 OLDER GAMER APPROVED  POTATO PC CERTIFIED  Visit our Currator Page "

												Bite Size - AvP ReviewThe Good:- 3 Separate Single Player Campaigns (one for marines, aliens, and predators)- Each story covers the same events but from the 3 different perspectives, which is kind of cool- Sound and art style really brings back memories of the movies- Multiple weapons and abilities for each race to use and experiment withThe Bad:- The Campaigns are only 2 hours long each (longer if you play on higher difficulties or spend time hunting for collectables)- The weapons and abilities of each race do sometimes feel clunky (don't expect Call of Duty feeling smooth shooting etc. and jumping from surface to surface as the aliens can be confusing)- The grab and kill animations for the aliens and predators look cool, BUT take so long to do that you are actually better off just stabbing people (also if you are caught executing someone, you are not invunerable, so you can easily loose 3/4 of your health by doing it at the wrong time)- Most of the levels from each single player campaign are reused for each story line, so it can be repetative - Multiplayer as of January 2017 seems to be deadThe Verdict:I was itching for some alien shooting fun, and for $4 I got a good 6 hours of entertainment so I really can't complain. The controls can feel a little bit clunky but you do get used to them. The campaign is relatively short, but honestly, I found it kind of nice that I could sit down one weekend and finish a game, rather than spend 20 more hours with it. For the price I acutally enjoyed my time with this game. My only knock against it is this - MULTIPLAYER IS DEAD. If you buying this for the multiplayer, skip it, no one is playing this anymore. If you just want to hear and see the iconic sounds and images of AvP this game is a cheap way to bring you back into that world.			"

												Aliens vs. Predator is a first-person shooter video game developed by Rebellion, the team behind the 1999 original Microsoft Windows game and published by Sega.AvP 2010 by Rebellion - My personal thoughts.After playing the heck out of the old AvP 2 (by Monolith) I had high hopes for this 2010 release, I stayed away from it for a long time till I picked it up on a sale (also, the game is worth is current 15 $ price) only to be a bit letdown by some of the design choices that we're taken during the development of this game.Let's talk a bit about what's good and what's bad with it, first off the good:Good graphics and atmosphereAwesome lighting effects and level designPolished sound design and decent voice actingThree campaigns that can offer you up to 10-12 hours of gameplaySolid multiplayer modes (Infestation on the pyramid level is simply amazing)Overall nice touches to the source materialPredator gameplay is really refined this time aroundThe bad:Weapons limitWeak storylineHorrible melee combat systemThe xeno campaign is the weakest and the most chlice of them allDead multiplayer matchmakingRecycled levelsMarines weapons feel underpoweredUnskipable finishing moves (and too repetitive too)Multiplayer XP is really useless (you can only buy skins, which is stupid)Bad ending (cliffhanger for a sequel maybe?)This is pretty much all I can say about this game. For an Aliens/Predator fan this is a no brainer, you must own this as it is a way better game than the sad A:CM and it offeres you tons of hours of fun. I give this game a 7/10, being drawed back from an 8 by the recycled enviroments and lame Aliens campaign. "

												This game is probably my favourite space game right now.  The game includes quite a few weaponry that would make your eyes widen and includes 3 different species for you to play as.The game's melee combat is a bit clunky and can be extremely frustrating at times, the way the melee system is this:- Light Attack Beats Heavy Attack  (Stumbles You - If they hit you with a light attack after hiting you, you will Fall Over)- Heavy Attack Beats Block  (Makes You Fall Over)- Block Beats Light Attack  (Stumbles You - If they hit you with a light attack after blocking you, you will Fall Over)The best way to do combat in Aliens vs. Predator is to always block, if you see them charging their heavy attack while you are blocking, hit them with a light attack and then again and finish them with a brutal kill or by hiting them over and over again while they're down OR if they go for a light attack, let them hit you while you block and then hit them to make them fall over and then brutal kill them or just repeatedly him them over and over again.The game includes games modes such as Free-For-All (Everyone versus everyone), Species DeathMatch (Humans vs Predators vs Xenomorphs), Mixed Species DeathMatch (Any species on any team versus eachother) and one more (i think) but i can't remember it. Overall the game deserves a 7/10 because the melee combat is annoying and when a predator gets his hands on a plasma cannon the xenomorphs have to either be obliterated or work together to bring him down. The humans are fine when this happens because all it takes is a human with a sniper rifle to shoot him in the head.  Also the xenomorphs wall climb can be super frustrating and disorientating when it makes you jump to the wrong wall or when your in a tight space where your xenomorph automatically goes on the walls (You can turn off auto-transition in the settings) so in my opinion this game is good but i would love to see them fix these issues or make an AVP 4 with better control for the xenomorphs.  Finally, you may not believe this but the HUMAN is actually the MOST OVERPOWERED species out of the three but feels the least coolest.  When the humans are in groups they are unstoppable, when the humans have shotguns or sniper rifles or have grenade launchers (which is a starting weapon!) they are unstoppable.  The only way to kill a human as a predator is to use stealth or long-range weapons and the only way to kill a human as a xenomorph is to catch them offguard by jumping on them from ceilings or ambush them or use flanking techniques.SPECIES INFORMATION:HUMANS:(Have Medium Health)(Have Medium Attack Speeds)(Are Better At Attacking At Long-Range And Are Really Powerful When In Groups)Primary: Pulse Rifle w/ Underbarrel Grenade Launcher (High Damage Assault Rifle with 99 shots, Super High Damage Grenade Launcher and is the starting weapon), Flamethrower (Sets enemies on fire and deals damage overtime), Sniper Rifle (Long-Range Rifle With Super High Damage with 6 shots i think), Shotgun (Super High Damage at Short-Range with 6 shots), Smartgun (Auto-Locking Weapon that deals Medium Damage with a Really High Firing Speed and can see enemies through walls with the Targeting Box - can also switch between auto-locking and manual aiming)Secondary: Pistol (Low Damage Pistol with a Medium Firing Speed)Stim: Heals You (Can hold 3 at a time)Block: Blocks incoming light attacks ONLYLight Attack: Medium Attack Speed with Low DamageHeavy Attack: Humans Do Not Have Heavy AttacksPREDATORS:(Have The Highest Health)(Have The Slowest Attacks)(Are Better At Being Stealthy And Doing Damage With Their Melee And Long-Range Weapons)Claw Blades: Light Attack (Fast Attack with Low Damage) and Heavy Attack (Slow Attack with High Damage AND Breaks Blocks) and Block (Blocks Light Attacks ONLY) and Long-Range Attack (Leap Towards your enemies with Medium Damage Attack that knocks enemies on the floor)Gadget (You Must Pick Them Up - You Can Switch Between Them Once Picking Them Up): Plasma Cannon (High Damage Lock On Weapon that takes time to lock on and knocks enemies back - Hold The Button AND Medium Damage Freefiring weapon that doesn't lock on - Press The Button), Spear (Instant Kill Weapon), Saw Blades (Instant Kill Laser Pointing Saw Blades that follow your beam and return to you  and bounce off walls), Plasma Mines (Almost Instantly Kill when enemies step on them)Health Shards: Heals You (In Multiplayer It Uses Energy - In Campaign You Pick Up Health Shards and can hold 3 at a time)Cloaking Device: Turns You Almost Invisible (You Uncloak if you attack, manually uncloak, perform a Brutal Kill and you can be partially seen when sprinting and leaping)Leap: Long-Range JumpBrutal Kill: Press [Action Button] on a knocked down enemy or from behind an enemy in order to instantly kill themEnergy: Can be recharged at terminals (Plasma Cannons, Health Shards and Plasma Mines use energy)Visions: Thermal (Highlights Humans and Predators - Can help you See Cloaked Enemies) and Xeno (Highlights Xenomorphs - Can Work As Night Vision) and Normal Vision (See Normally Like Humans)XENOMORPHS:(Have The Lowest Health)(Have The Fastest Attacks)(Are Better At Flanking And Making Enemies Disorientated)Claws: Light Attack (Fast Attack with Low Damage) and Block (Blocks Light Attacks ONLY) and Long-Range Attack (Leap Towards your enemies with Medium Damage Attack that knocks enemies on the floor)Tail: Heavy Attack (Slow Attack with High Damage AND Breaks Blocks)Passive Ability: Wall Climb (Climb on any surface and jump from surface to surface - Your crosshair will tell you which direction is the ground incase you get disorientated)Vision: See All Species Through Walls That Are Close To YouHealing: Regenerate Health OvertimeBrutal Kill: Press [Action Button] on a knocked down enemy or from behind an enemy in order to instantly kill someoneShadows: Hide in the shadows to be Almost Invisible To Humans and Predators using Normal Vision (Your crosshair will tell you if you're in the shadows)Lure: Hiss to Lure an Enemy To YouTerminal Destroying: You can destroy Predator's terminals to stop them from recharging their energy			"

												Great game, had a lot of hype to live up to. The campaigns are quite good, ranging from the very Cod-like marine campaign to the better of the three, aliens and Predators. Aliens is a fun hide and seek type character with losing resulting in a bloody death. Predator is where morst people are going to have fun, pretending to be other marines whilst taking their skulls as trophies. The multiplayer was great fun, but is now unfortunately dead. Hopefully this game will come back on sale and we get the multiplayer experience we deserve.			"

												After my joke review, here is the real one.AvP 2010 is very underrated in my opinion, only problem with it nowadays is the lack of people in multiplayer, which you can run into Hackers since there is no VAC protection, I recommend getting some friends to play this with you. You can play as 3 characters/classes: Predator and Alien obviously, but also marine, here is their playstyles.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Predator: Think of him as a strategic hunter, you have a choice of 4 weapons that are scatted around the area, he also has 3 visions:Normal, Alien, and Thermal. Alien helps you see aliens which will be highlighted in Green, and thermal helps catch other Predators, but here are his list of weapons:1. Plasma Caster, a weapon that tracks down your target almost like an aimbot, but it's easy to avoid as an Alien.2.Smart Disc, a projectile you can control, 1 hits Aliens if it hits their head. Also stuns.3. Spear, a  projectile that while is hard to hit is a 1 hit kill guaranteed.4. Mines, as the name implies, THEY'RE MINES. If you can track your enemies movement patterns, you can lay these in areas they might go in. As they are hard to see unless you are another Predator.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alien: He is hard to see in the Dark and his tail whips are a vicious weapon, especially if used on the walls. With Alien, you want to stay on the walls as much as possible, never stop moving either since this makes you an easy target, as Aliens have extremely low health, but high kill potential. The Aliens best move would be his Heavy attack since it stuns longer than the predators does. Aliens can't fight Predators alone, that is a death wish, get another Alien pal to help you take one down, similar to the movies, they like to swarm instead of attack alone, like ants or bees.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Marine: If you want to be under constant pressure of hearing Aliens growling and Predators roaring... Marine is for you!But in all honesty, Marine is quite good if you can use him right, he of course uses guns to fight, so here are some of his guns:Pistol: Unlimited Ammo, but very little damage. You most likely will not want to use this.Pulse Rifle:A good, all around weapon.Shotgun:If you like to get in an Alien or Predators face, you can use the shotgun, it's buckshot is extremely powerful and it stuns.Flamethrower:Not used very much, pouring Gasoline can help do extra damage.Sniper Rifle: Almost an insta-kill if headshots, very good.Smart Gun: Can track enemies through walls, has an Aimbot, reduces your weapon slots and speed though.Bad if you are trapped by them, mainly because it can only focus one at a time. But good if you are trying to deal with one at a time.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, that is all I got, this a very fun game I think that should be revived. The graphics are very good, and the gameplay feels nice. Campaigns are fun.My personal rating would be about an: 8.5/10			"

Aliens vs Predator 3Karl Bishop Weyland: ""This has been a high-cost operation. Let us hope that my predecessor's faith in it was justified.""The AVP series returns! AVP 2(Which isnt even on steam!!) was released a whopping 9 years before this game! Thats definetely too long to be waiting!.Anyway this game's main strong point in SP is that you have 3 campaigns to play (much like the earlier games.) Obviously you have the Path of the Predator , Alien and the Weakest of them all...Marine

This game gets lots ""correct"" as expected, but most are already standard this kind of series but many gameplay mechanics and controls are awkward and there are many imbalances in Multiplayer unfortunetely. But ill cover all that in the Pros and Cons below.Pros:+Campaigns (15 hours on average)+Many Collectibles to read (Backstry+Hot Corporal xD+Interesting Story for the Marine and the Predator that show very unique motivations!+Amazing Multiplayer Modes! The three Species really combine for some real chaos! (Across 7 Gamemodes!)+Weapons are Creative and have different ""Classes"" for each species too.+A new Planet (BG-386) with about 6 Large Environments to explore. These Maps are ""recreated"" slightly for multiplayer but the unique feel that each one brings still remains.+Soundtrack and General Sound clarity (Especially for the ""Rookie"" Marine). This mixed with the environments really help immersive the player! (Some examples of great sound effects being used include: Rocks Crumbling in the Pyramid and Ruins, Frogs, Birds and even other-worldy creatures make their calls and even Noisy Dust Storms on Barren Areas of the Surface.+General Mechanics are very unique for each species. Some Examples include: Blood Stained Motion-Tracker HUD for the Marine, Simplified but Advanced Predator HUD with Special Symbols representing Health, Energy and even 4 View-Modes (Including the Infamous infra-Red/ Marine-Doom Vision). The Predator HUD is especially awesome though because its like an ancient language native to the species with very few icons/symbols on-screen at once, power and health only show when they are affected but the Environment/Enemies. +Alien Traversal- Climb Everywhere! Maybe...Behind you+Predator Traversal- ""Jumpin, Jimmies! Hes fast..""+Very Gory for players who like that sort of thing (I know i do ;D)+Finishers in Multiplayer are amazingly creative and is more than equivalent to backstabbing someone in COD (Thats why its special!) A Short-scene will play showing the Gory finish and aftermath of the enemy you just dominated! (Similar to DooM 4...in a Way)

			Hardened Marine, Strategic Predator and Swift Xenomorph come together in an epic showdown. All about Reflexes...and if he remembered to grab some extra  ammo 		


Cons:-The majority of maps are boring and lack interesting Features in Multiplayer. For Example, there are no items to interact with, no environmental traps or danger zones, and ZERO Light adjustments when in very dark areas! (Marine's sh*tty flashlight isnt going to do anything!!)-Marine is so underpowered compared with the Predator, but more even when compared with the Aliens abilites. (Motion tracker was made for the Xenos!)-Story is so short for each species. Although decent, its lacking in any effort to make the player really care for/trust/love/despise/ interested about. There are about 5 characters in the Marine story that i was interested in. Especially after reading the Logs. But Many Marine Grunts, Allies and even the main Antagonist (Lack of history about them when playing..have to rely on more logs to really understand their intentions.) Make a noticeably small impact on players. Of course this is an Action FPS but more connection with fellow squad members would be very interesting (something that Colonial Marines has instead!?)-Speaking of Marine Grunts, the Voice Acting is repetitive and unimportant ""obvious"" commands can easily be ignored/misheard due to the proximity you need to be.. :(-The Graphics are Terrible for a Game of its Reputation and time period! at 2000 and 2001 it didnt really matter about that sort of thing, but this isn't good at all!It definetely not grainy, but instead it very glossy/reflective and doesnt handle darkness well at all. This is good for the Predator and the Alien, but once again the Marine comes off worse!-Alien Campaign's Plot and Levels is very predictable, crawl here, escape from here, harvest those people, etc. least interesting story of the 3 but the ending is very good :D-The Marine movements are slow and clearly Flawed when compared with the other enemies. It also suffers some painfully Bad Controls (and LACK of some controls) such as: he runs out of breath after 5 seconds of running, no crouching of prone, no ADS or Iron-Sights and he even jumps a whopping 5 centimetres in the air!-Multiplayer unlocks (Rewards for HARD WORK)are bland and the alien skins are Very Similar, out of the 3 species youd expect the natural predator with elite organic claws and fangs to have the most variation! But only 2 of the Alien Skins really stand out (Out of 6)-Unfortuntely there isnt enough maps to go with the large ammount of gamemodes! (It should be reversed!!)-Speaking of Multiplayer, It has Died a Pitiful, Lonely Life..-The Lack of intereactive elements in levels, especially in multiplayer! this is not good for the marine, who could really use a sentry unit to set-up and assist them!Or a Crusher door which could trap and Squish the enemies!-Marine Ending wasnt as good as it could have been.. The Endings of the Xeno and The Pred were much more satisfying!! Although the Marine is much easier to learn to control than the others (Maybe Because hes just a human?)-Lots of Visual Effects (eg:Explosions) on screen can cause freezing or some noticeable frame rate drops.-The Alien Controls are VERY sensitive and irregular for your average FPS Player, Finish the Story before trying out The Cute little Xenos in MP.Lots to Understand obviously when it comes to this game. SP and MP are Seperate realms really. Overall I'd say this game tries too hard to give a generic action-guns-blazing kind of feel (Inspired by Aliens?) But i would have prefered the Marine to focus on horror and a deep storyline that involved a Corporation sized Evil. I would have prefered the Alien Plot to Follow some kind of hive-Growth or exploration for a new colony! With Co-op Partners even (I know its asking lots) to help harvest the masses! I thought that Predator Plot was actually very Good! Once you get the hang of all their controls (Takes the Longest time to master.) The Parts of it that really stood out to me included: Finding an ancient artifact, destroying an Lethal abomination that the Predators themselves Bred and all while growing from a Training Young Wolf into a Lord!-(Pred-Ranks)This game in SP i found  interesting but each campaign was obviously cut short due to storage space and developing time. Not Good!This game in MP i find lacks many crucial Features/Physics/Gameplay Options of an Standard FPS, but this is AVP...with 3 different Species to choose from, (Let alone characters..) so ill let it off with a warning this time.I Rate SP- 7/10 (Predator has the most unique Plot)I Rate MP- 6/10 (Lack of Maps and Weapon-Balancing ruins the good chance it had promised.)So Overall that is a 6.5/10 if you want to be Specific! So buy this in a Sale...but Good luck finding Matches in MP! (Theres many groups for the Determined)

												This game, to many people, is a blow off game that you play 20 hours of and all the campaign. You play 1 hour of the multiplayer, get destroyed, and leave. But if you keep playing, you will find freinds who will also be addicted to this game you guys with have some of the best times of your life. The multiplayer is a little glitchy and unbalanced at first, but master it and its all equal: and addicting. It super fun, even after you might get bored of the gametypes, get a group of friends and create a gamemode. All in all, one of the most memorable games of all time.			"

												A lot of people were complaining about this being mediocre. Trust me it is not mediocre. Ride to hell, and Alien Colonial Marines is mediocre. This is a solidly built game, with three different modes of gameplay. You truly feel slithery as an Alien, Agile as a Predator and Lethal as a marine. Game plays well, and is varied in regards to the three titular characters.			"

												A good example of how fun a aliens/predator game can be when they are combined. The game allows you to play either marines, aliens or predators; each with their own unique story and gameplay that gives you that ""feeling"" of being one of these creatures...well besides marines not being able to crouch but you can find mods to fix that. ======The Good======1. Being able to play as any 3 speices, using their abilities and weapons seem from their films. 2. Story - I felt the story for all 3, rather interesting. Even though there are a few plot holes in the story, they all come together rather nicely and keeps you interested on moving through the game. 3. A.I - I felt the a.i was good for this game. The aliens would crawl all over the place and even run off to regroup or to flank you, so did the marines. The only issue I did have was the predator which they seem very aggressive just charging in instead of using the environment to their advantage or their abilities but this might be just a oversight with the limitations of the game for it's time or may be a bug with their a.i. Overall they kept me moving...not like Aliens CM======The 50/50======1. I felt the online was alright, the horde mode was rather fun having to hold locations while waves of enemies push towards you. However the pvp aspect felt boring for example AVP 2 had evacuation which had marines fight their way to do objectives to reach a dropship while the other team played as aliens with unlimited spawns aiming for one thing....kill all humans. It was a fun mode that had marines working together creating hold points while other teammates pushed on to get to the end. 2. Plot - There are a few issues here and there that felt missing in the story. One example is in the alien's story but I won't spoil it. Even though the game does try to cover some of these missing points, the end result felt unsatisfied. 3. Maps - I felt the maps were a little boring to be honest. Most times your fighting in a orange looking place (colony exterior) or a forest like area. Would of been nice for more mixture such as other planets, onboard a ship. I felt AVP2 had a good mix of locations for each spieces which gave you a good feel of not getting bored or sick of your play area.======The Bad======1. Controls - There are a few issues with controls for example alien's wall movement doesn't feel right to me and most times feel very strange to control and end up making me feel completely confused on where I'm at. For marines not being able to crouch while aliens are crawling all over the place such as under tables...makes it annoying to fight sometimes. Even though you can just run around the place to draw them out it just feels leaking in the overall immersion. ======Overall======I do recommend this game until a hardcore Aliens like game comes out where we can wield doors, setup turrets, drive the apc and use smartguns while screaming ""GAME OVER MAN,GAME OVER"". Until then though I recommend this game as Aliens Colonial Marines just felt lacking in regards to the overall feel. This game even though adds predators to the mix it feels more of a marines vs aliens game most of the time. If your a fan of the universes and watch to be able to play as either side, then make sure to pick this up. Also it's very cheap now adays.			"

												Itâs a bugâs life, and moreAvP has an unusual structure, offering three single player campaigns plus several multiplayer modes. You have the chance to play as marine, alien, and predator and although the story line in each campaign is independent of the others they do exist within the same story arc. I really enjoyed all three campaigns, although the predator gameplay and mechanics were the least satisfying. The marine campaign is the most challenging, as you often feel underpowered against the aliens, but itâs not frustrating and this vulnerability certainly adds to the already considerable tension. Playing as an alien can be disorientating at times and the movement system takes some getting used to but itâs worth it for the fun to be had stalking the marines and scientists. Playing as a predator, although still enjoyable, was not quite as much fun, and I found the gameplay and combat systems in this campaign less convincing than in the others. The atmosphere throughout is impressive and the graphics are good (although some animations are a little muddy in colour). The voice acting is also good, which helps to add to the compelling atmosphere. It isnât a long game (I took my time, but still completed the three campaigns in about 15 hours) and the multiplayer seems pretty much dead (I did manage a few games, but only with friends) but if you can get it on sale, as I did, itâs well worth a few quid. Despite its flaws this game successfully recreates the atmosphere and edginess of the movies and should not disappoint fans of the two franchises. 4/5			"

												So, I bought this game a week ago and this is my review for this game:1)This game supports old grapich cards (Mine is GTX 470) and you can play normally (on low settings of course), I thought this game won't work on my computer but it is the only game I play on my account.2)The multiplayer is not very dead at this game (3 full servers at once) and you can always find a server that you can play one, however there are some hackers at this game and it will make you â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, when hacker is entering the game just leave the server and let the hacker play on his own, by the way hackers are reported as well.By the way the multiplayer has a ranking system,(1 is lowest, 43 is the highest) as you getting higher in your rank you get new skins from movies and the game itself (campaign).3) The campaign in this game is amazing, very interesting and you can play the campaign in 4 different difficulities (Easy,Normal,Hard and Nightmare), I played the campaign and finished it in all 4 difficulities.4)The community of the game is very united, everybody talking with each other and helping each other, you can see this when we report hackers and making them to leave to game.I hope you'll join us and help us to make this game great again.

												The combat itself is very tense and the aliens will attack you from all sides. Whilst you must keep an eye on your motion tracker it's hard to do so when you are aiming at an alien on the ceiling and can hear the Predator laughing at you and get attacked from behind. You start out in an industrial complex and the feel and tone of the game are much like Doom 3 as it's very dark and you must rely on your torch (or flashlight if you will) although there are some larger inside and outside areas. The game breaks you in gently with movement showing up on your motion scanner but not actually appearing whilst you get accustomed to your range of movement and controls which are standard FPS controls. The sounds are awesome though. A lot of work has been done in this area and all the sound effects from the films are there.The story for each race is fairly short; the Marine probably gets the most out of it all, followed by the Predator & Alien. Each race also plays quite differently due to their differing abilities. The Alien is fast but surprisingly fragile - you must be stealthy at all times; the Marine relies on ranged weapons while the Predator & Alien mostly need to get in close, and so on. All in all, it's an interesting mix and the differences in the storyline are played out quite well. There's also a decent selection of multiplayer modes for all species and a wave-after-wave ""survival"" mode for the Marine. "

												Aliens vs. Predator is a reboot of the extremely successful Aliens vs. Predator PC-game franchise, whose only 2 releases were in 1999 and 2001.  The 2010 release is made by the same team as the originals and features much of the same gameplay and features. I played through the Predator campaign and tried some of the Alien and Marine levels for my first impressions.The Good:* This game features three separate campaigns, each with completely different control schemes and game mechanics. Although they are all FPS-action, the similarities between the three campaigns sort of end there. The Marine campaign plays a lot like a horror FPS game, you are stuck in dark hallways with a flashlight and loads of weaponry. The predator game is a bit more stealth & platform-based: the predator campaign gives you control of a character with super jumping power, the ability to go semi-invisible, and the ability to perform stealth takedowns. Finally, the alien campaign allows your character to walk on walls and ceilings, run extremely quickly, and also regenerate health over time. The alien campaign also features stealth elements but has a remarkably different feel from any other FPS game due to your avatar's low viewing position and extremely fast speed.* The jumping mechanics for the predator are excellent: fun and intuitive. The game is fair in its level design regarding the implementation of a playable character that has super-human jumping abilities.* The game's plot is interwoven across all 3 campaigns. You can experience the same story from 3 different perspectives.* Great ""kill"" animations, but there are too few of them.The Bad:* Field-of-view is locked at around 70 degrees or so. Not the worst, but annoying.* Inconsistent graphical quality. Some things look amazing, other times I felt like I was playing a Half-Life mod.* The predator gameplay, which I was most looking forward to, is lackluster. The stealth technology hardly seems to work on the Marines, and it does not work at all vs. Aliens.* Melee combat never really does well in FPS games, and 2/3rds of this game is melee combat. The developers needed some sort of gimmick or game mechanic to make the combat interesting, rather than just repeatedly mashing down the LMB.* The auto-save checkpoints don't work if you're trying to play all three campaigns at the same time. For example, your savegame in the predator campaign will get overwritten if you try to go play the marine campaign. This problem can be fixed by manually saving your game, or restarting levels from the very beginning. The Ugly:* The single-player game is essentially three long hallways with objectives clearly pointed out for the player with plenty of hand-holding. I am getting sick of games like that.* The wall-climbing aspect of the alien is unintuitive and seems to only work half the time. Rather than giving me a button to click to go on a wall, my character should just automatically start climbing it. But that is not the worst part: the game puts in things like computer banks and bookcases against walls to purposefully restrict you from using certain walls. It is incredibly annoying that a super powerful alien can decimate an entire spaceship of marines but cannot climb on walls that happen to have computer banks at the bottom of them.* Multiplayer, which is supposed to be a large chunk of the game's playability, is completely dead.The Verdict:Although Aliens vs. Predator is a solid FPS with some innovative game mechanics, it does little to enhance gaming as a whole. The game will not be remembered five years from now and will most likely never make it onto anyone's top 10 list for anything. But the game is a fun diversion worth checking out if you can find the game on a deep sale. However, I don't think you will make it through any of the campgaigns before getting bored so I cannot recommend it.			"

												Grabbed this title when it was on sale. I played it plenty more on console back when it first came out so ignore the small time it shows me on itSummary (WAT YOU NEED TO KNOW)This game covers another entry into the popular AVP series. Though there really isn't any consistancy between the games its worth noting that this is the 3rd entry. with the last two entries being outstanding and very popular. You get to play thourhg a campaign as either the Alien, a Predator or a Colonial Marine each with its own distinctive gameplay, plot and levels. Usually the campaigns criss cross at some point.Presentation:The game looks great first off, even when it shows its age it still looks damn impressive at times. Much of the tech and level design is faithful to the lore of the setting (Though not as much as say Isolation) The Aliens look sharp and well detailed, the predator looks just as big and mean as when Arnie fought him and the marines look every bit the bad â¥â¥â¥ muthas that you expect them too.Gameplay: I'll break this up into 3 parts to represent each campaign as they vary drastically depending on which you go with each campaign starts with a through (almost annoyingly so) Tutorial so you can figure out how each character works easily enoughAlien: The Xeno campiagn is mostly based around you being a sneaky â¥â¥â¥â¥ and getting the drop on your enemies either through suprise, hit and run or simple bait and lure tactics. You are often at a disadvantage against your foes as you have no range alternative and your HTH options are suprisingly limited. (Basically do whatever you can to stagger your enemy than eat his face) failing that just get behind him an well...eat his facePredator: As the galaxy's best hunter you have a decent array of options at your disposal including bombs, a laser cannon, wrist blades, razor disc etc etc...all of them draw from a energy pool that you never quite seem to have enough of so you'll spend much of your time using the same bait and lure ambush tactics as the Xeno except your HTH options are bit more fleshed out. A personal favorite of mineMarine: The Colonial marine campaign is a pretty standard FPS fare, being more of a ""OH NOES SPOOKY ALIUMS!"" throughout most of it. Still its got it's charm, many of the classic weapons make a appearence including every ones favorite pulse rifle. Sadly this feels like the weakest campaign in the game and probably the weakest one of the entire series (AVP2 had a amazing marine campaign) You'll also notice some almost cringe worthy dialogue in this campaignMultiplayer: Absolutely dead. It was fairly entertaining on console but it just never quite took off.Summary: get the game when its on sale.			"

												In Aliens VS Predator you are able to play three different Stories as three different species, the Humans, the Aliens and the Predator. It took me not much more than 3 hours to finish each of their own stories on the Normal difficulty without looking for every collectible the game has to offer. Considering itâs a game from 2010 I was really satisfied with the visuals. The forests look dense and the water looks crystal clear. Light and shadow look good considering itâs been awhile since the game was released. If you are an Alien movie fan from the very first movie when it was released in 1979 by Ridley Scott then you may find more enjoyment in Aliens VS Predator then, say, in Aliens: Colonial Marines. The Marine Story was the first one I experienced and among your typical FPS shooting action and objectives, I managed to find some tense moments where light could be as useful as bullets. Setting a proper mood when playing can improve your experience quite a bit so a darker room with some sort of surround headphones can be a big changer. Some of the weapons were accurate when portraying the sound from the original movies, yet, there were many times I felt overpowered against such terrifying enemy. The predator Story was my favorite from the three. Right from the start, as predator, you will have to proof you are worth to join the most elite soldiers. Hunting and stealth tactics will be your best weapon. Divide to conquer is the best strategy one can find while trying to get your precious human trophies. Some may find an extreme satisfaction by taking their time to caught the enemies by surprise while finishing them off with a decapitation while others may prefer a more direct, ruthless approach. Itâs up to you how you play, just remember that itâs a good idea to adapt as you play different species.Playing the Alien story was the most hard for me. While it took me some time to get used to the controls by climbing the ceiling, walls and so on these missions gave me some harsh motion sickness, turning the experience really different and less enjoyable from the other two. After (if) you get used to the fast walking and crawling between walls, floors and ceilings you will feel the horror is about to arrive to those poor Marines. Waiting and stalking the prey when they less expect feels amazing and I found myself to avoid killing all the soldiers if it was not required. The notion of panic from the Marine soldiers is well noted and if you are spotted they will try to find you and terminate you, hence why it makes such a difference to wait in order to deal the final blow to the enemy. In the end I had great fun with the game and I still believe it holds up in this time and day. If you are an Alien or Predator fan Iâm sure you already played this game, if not, I think it deserves a good chance, for the right price. The Online portion of the game may be absent considering nobody still plays by now but either way the three different campaigns remains a solid experience that may be worth your attention and also your time.

												Aliens vs Predator 2010 Game, I originally bought this on Ps3 back when it first came out and it was a hell of a blast for the first 3 months until the player base fell sadly, the good news is that there are alot of people still playing this game on Steam.The game has 3 different single player modes for each species (Xenomorph-Alien, Predator, and Humans-Marine) but the game is most fun playing Online with and against others, it also has a Co Op game mode where you team up with 3 others as marines and face waves of Aliens so its basically Horde mode. Overall I would recommend this to anyone that is a fan to the series, 8/10 from me :)			"

												This Aliens vs. Predator game is the third one made, so therefore for further reference I'm going to be referring to it as AvP3.AvP3 was my first date with the Alien and Predator franchises, and for what it's worth it did get me hooked and really interested in the lore of both series. The thing that makes the Aliens vs. Predator games unique from any other series in its genre is that there are three playable races, each with their pros and cons and benefits.You have the Alien; a very fast killing machine that can climb on walls, leap considerable distances, murder people from behind in spectacularly gruesome ways, and can pounce on unsuspecting prey. The Colonial Marines are more or less standard shooter controls; the Marines carry two primary weapons (only one if using the Smartgun, which is an autolocking machine gun that tracks its targets and follows them as they move) and a handgun with infinite ammo; their most valuable asset is a motion tracker that works as radar for any movement, which can help the Marines track any moving Aliens or Predators.The Predator is, to me, a blend of the Alien and the Marine - the Predator uses powerful weaponry: a laser cannon, plasma mines, a giant spear, wrist blades, and a spinning battle disc, and is able to engage a cloaking device that makes him very difficult to spot, though with enough observation they'll eventually become a bit easier to notice. The Predator, like the Alien, moves like the wind and is capable of leaping tremendous distances, more so than the Alien.These three species have their own singleplayer stories that all link together; the chronological order of each story's events being Alien > Marine > Predator, though certain moments interlap. These three campaigns play out in the same way as their respective species do - the Alien's campaign is just a lengthy killing spree; the Marine's is a struggle to escape the planet, and the Predator is on a hunt for his missing clan mates, as well as to kill Aliens and Marines for sport. The Marine and Predator campaigns are pretty good; the Alien campaign is brutally short and repetitive as hell, unfortunately.Then we have the multiplayer... and that's where the waters get rough and the boat begins to shake. The multiplayer is intense and fast-paced; you have access to your standard modes; free-for-all, team deathmatch, control point(s) on the map, horde mode, etc., and you're free to play as whichever species you'd like. The problem is that the species are horrendously unbalanced. Aliens, in particular, are underpowered since they have no ranged attacks, and unlike the Marine, who uses morphine shots to heal bars of health, and the Predator, who uses magical heroin needles to revive himself, the Aliens have no method of quickly regaining health. Predator players are gigantic â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s in that the plasma caster (that cool thing over the Predator's shoulder) does one-shot kills when fully charged up, and can track targets from ludicrously long ranges. So as a result you get Predators spamming plasma caster bolts and getting loads of one-shot kills. Marines generally don't have much a need to pick up different weapons, since they spawn with a pulse rifle with 99 rounds loaded, and almost 300 in reserve; not to mention the pulse rifle is highly accurate, fires quickly, and can shoot grenades if picked up on the battlefield.This game is pretty good, I would say; the multiplayer is good in short, controlled bursts; the campaigns tell an interesting, interconnected story; the graphics are great; the gameplay of all three races is unique and not a copy-and-paste of each other, and is ultimately worth checking out. But in terms of an actual recommendation, this is by no means the BEST AvP game. AvP2 - Aliens versus Predator 2, a 2001 game, has that honor. That game isn't on Steam right now, unfortunately, but I can't begin to explain how cool and unique that game is.			"

												âââââ - ""Worth your time, give it a bash""PROS:- Design of this game this brilliant and right down to a tee as far as the movies are concerned.- Multiplayer, its a  huge part of this game as why I played it back in 2010, its intense and great fun.- 3 parallel single player modes which allow you to play as Marine, Predator and Alien. This means variety as you switch between the three between missions and each have there different abilities and weapons with the Predator particularly having the best mix of weapons including laser, mines, disc and spear.- The marine single player was my favourite, only for the reason that it felt great looking desperately around for Aliens crawling around the walls in the darkness.- Animations, they get repetitive but they look great.- Being able to launch in DirectX11 means that even today the game looks pretty good.- Collectables, if you get really into it theres plenty of things to look for in each story.- The arena fights between the three enemies are pretty fun and there are a couple of decent boss like battles, the one as you play as the Predator against the Queen stands out.- Sound in this game is superb, the calls of the Aliens/Predators, the sound of your rifle and the bleep of your radar. CONS:- Whilst the 3 stories are parallel the plot is pretty rubbish, I didn't care for it as I was only in for the action and whilst each have there own little endings the environments you reach in stages depend on the timings you play the stories, this means the environments run the risk of being repetitive.- Lack of Marine weapons, there aren't enough and the flamethrower will end up killing you more often than your enemies. No grenades either? Stupid!- Androids, they're tough. Harder to kill than the Alien and even the Predator, a shotgun is there only real weakness.- Alien controls are clunky at times, transition between walls leaves you lost and there aren't really enough types of attack.VERDICT?By no means the most polished game, nor the best single player but it offers something a bit different and lots of variety in the 3 game styles and a brilliant multiplayer on dedicated servers *cheers wellen1981			"

												This is another game that I got on Xbox when it launched. This AVP might not be as good as some of the classic AVP games, but I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed the three single player campaigns when I played them all the way through on Xbox.  The single player is pretty good, an opinion not shared by many people.  As mentioned above there are three campaigns, one for Predators, one for Marines, and one for Xenomorphs. Each is a different length and the play style for each character is radically different. The biggest issue with the game, at least in my opinion is the multiplayer. The single hit executions are all fine and dandy in the single player game mode, but they quickly become boring and just generally un-fun in multiplayer. You end up spawning and dying multiple times a minute from all these insti kill attacks. Another issue is that the melee, a huge part of the game for the two alien races is generally terrible. There is a ton of stun spam, and while there are ways to break out of this you die so fast (from insti-kill button prompt attacks) that to me makes the multiplayer feel not even worth it. Couple that with the low player base and the cheaters and I just dont know what to say.  There are indeed cheaters though, speed hacks and all sorts of stuff along those lines.  Perhaps my experience with the PC version of multiplayer AVP is abnormal, I dont know. what I do know is that after playing a bunch hours I was completely prepared to never come back to multiplayer in this game.  I still recommend the single player though to anyone looking for a new AVP game! But I would hope you waited for a sale and bought this super cheap.  Overall I probably forgot to touch on some of the more important parts of the game, I still hope this will do as an acceptable review for now.			"

												Dissappointed by Colonial Marines?  Good, here's your solution.  Aliens VS. Predator is straightforward.  There are Aliens, there are Predators, there are Marines, go nuts â¥â¥â¥â¥ everything.  Graphically it's not that impressive, sound design is alright.The game's campaign is split in three.  Theres an Alien Campaign, Predator Campaign, and a Human Campaign.The Alien Campaign is alright.  Gameplay is average, you run around on walls and can drop down and attack people.  Enemies are highlighted.  It plays a bit like a stealth game.  Since the Alien doesn't have alot of Health you have to sneak around.  You can destroy lighting to hide yourself better, and you have to rely on speed to catch up with your target.  The story for the Alien Campaign however is predictably weak, and gets really repetitive after awhile.  Problem is, there's no Predators featured at all until the final level's Boss Fight.  It's an Aliens VS. Predator game with no Predator fighting in the Alien Campaign.  AI tends to be a bit dumb at times too, which makes it even more dull and mundane.The Predator Campaign is probably the best part of the game.  Predator has thermal vision and stuff that highlights enemies, and can cloak and run around and has all the cool Predator weapons.  The Predator Campaign is the only campaign that prominently features all the factions as enemies.  You fight a mix of Humans and Aliens.  AI is still a bit dumb.  The Predator also had the best final boss in the game.  Fighting it was an absolute blast.  Story here is once again a bit weak.The Human Campaign is a semi-generic FPS with Colonial Marine gear.  There are different weapons and you shoot things with them.  You run out of ammo really quickly so you have to actually be careful and time your shots well.  This can be tricky though because you'll panic.  Alot.  This game manages to make you afraid alot.  The Aliens although still a bit dumb, are far more intelligent and threatening than the ones in say, Colonial Marines.  They're also alot tougher and a prolonged encounter with them gets really tense.  The game doesn't quite stay as true to the asthetic and gear of the Marines used in Aliens, but it's still entertaining.  My biggest problem is once again, the lack of any actual Aliens VS. Predator here.  Most of the game you spend fighting Aliens or Androids.  There's a brief segment where you fight a Predator about halfway through, but with the buildup of the Predator's appearance in the Human Campaign, you'd expect more.  Story is absurdly weak and predictable, even though the Human Campaign should have the best storytelling potential.All of the events of these campaigns take place concurrently.  While it's a neat narrative idea, the story in each campaign is still weak and linking them all together doesn't help it in anyway, and TBH it feels like a lazy excuse for the dev to recycle the same levels for the different campaigns, which it does to the point of frustration.  Each faction also gets hyper gory execution animations, which are done very well and certainly earn that M Rating.Not even going to talk about Multiplayer, which is mostly dead.  Anyone still playing is either a hacker or someone who just bought the game and will be gone soon.Overall, a seriously flawed game, but still better than most Alien games on the market.5/10, buy it on sale only if you're a fan of the franchise.

 Aliens vs. Predator  The game offer us three campaigns singleplayer and multiplayer servers which are completely empty. Marine campaign is fun and quite easy however, in multiplayer it is frightening because no one of players do not want to play them. The Second one in the queue are aliens which playing on multi there is a lot of fun as well as playing as the Predator. However, the controls can result in attempting to vomit. Last in line is a Predator, thanks to which the game takes a lot of advantages. The story itself and the control has been well made. Predator has a lot of tools that you already have or you need to find them that will help him in murdering the humans and aliens. The advantage of this game are also pleasing to the eye finishers. Personally, I had a lot of fun while playing this game and I'm totally able to recommend this production to anyone especially since it can be purchased for a very small amount of money.  "

												I played this game awhile back on the Playstation 3 when it first came out and logged in close to 200 hours and had a complete blast with it. The PC version has a relatively active community and it's just as fun as it was before.The negatives are that Predators in the multiplayer section are vastly stronger than both aliens and marines, there should be a limit of 1-3 predators per game, it really ruins deathmatch and TDM. There is also a very real issue of high ping users so stick to dedicated servers. The aliens also have very (very) awkward controls and take some time getting used to, especially when transitioning onto different surfaces. Multiplayer in general is poorly balanced.Even with these issues it is still a fun game with an actually enjoyable story mode that can be replayed in order to collect items. Honestly, with some tweaking to balances and controls, a remake of this game would be an instant purchase for me.  "

												If you love the Alien and Predator films but did not enjoy their versus films (don't even get me started on AvP: Requiem) this is the game for you. 3 split campaigns that all offer up a different playing experience and style.Human:A standard FPS with a variety of weapons and Xenomorph killing. The most story driven campaign and least intersting gameplay.Alien:Very stealth oriented and has cool features such as climbing on any surfaces,.The least story driven campaign and the most interesting gameplay.Predator:A combination of stealth, melee combat, and long-ranged combat. The intermediate between the Human and Alien with a good story and good gameplay.Before you make this purchase however, make sure you are not buying this game strictly for the multiplayer. The multiplayer is very dead, so the most reliable way of playing with friends is through LAN.			"

												Much like the previous two, an action FPS tailored around the alien and predator franchises, but with better graphics, improved level design and much more gore, at the cost of being slightly more linear (especially for marines). As the multiplayer is pretty much dead you'd be paying Â£10 for the three in game campaigns, and having beaten all three atleast twice (including on nightmare) I can say its worth it.This entry does a much better job at getting the feel of the marine (and how slow and sluggish he is), the predator (and his overpowering strength & impressive agility) and especially the alien, getting just how nimble and agile these creatures are. Xenomorphs can easily transition between walls and ceilings, harvest humans with facehuggers, pounce unsuspected enemies from the dark and even destroy lights to make your job easier. The alien also has regenerating health, which is something I missed in the other two games (because xenomorphs don't need to feed, they survive on their blood alone).Though if bug hunting, facehugging and trophy collecting isnt your thing, I recommend Alien: Isolation, as it swaps out the action for horror.

												Aliens vs. Predator is a great modern remake of a classic PC game. Having played Aliens vs. Predator and Aliens vs. Predator 2 in the early 2000's, I had high expectations for this game and it did not disappoint. Graphically speaking the game is sleek, detailed, and surprisingly good for a 2010 release. As with previous incarnations of Aliens vs. Predator for the PC, you can play as a Marine, Alien, or a Predator, each with their own story and gameplay. There are several games in the series before this remake, and one sequel Alien: Isolation, released in 2014.			"

The graphics look great for a game made in 2010 and make use of DX11 well.Weapons are as close to sounding, working and feeling as in the films.Great for Nostalgia induced from fandom.However this game also has a multiplayer which for a game of its age, has decomissioned servers.There are 3-6 active player owned servers but my connection from the Bundus in Namibia is bad and I can rarely play and enjoy some PVP. Ranking online is near impossible as you make very little xp for hard effor.My recommendation is: Buy it. WHEN ITS ON SPECIAL. FOR 75%, otherwise don't bother if you are looking for PVP AVP action.

(In my opinion)The longer this game you play the more you feel stupid.Singleplayer is a simple process with a pretty good story that will go on your nerves up on Nightmare difficulty.-They say it's the best AvP game. Hard to say.-Multiplayer plays a few dozen of people so you always find a server.-The game is highly repetitive.

												I got this as a fan of the Aliens vs. Predator franchise, and I honest-to-God liked playing its Single-Player campaign.ProsBeautiful, realistic visuals.3 campaigns of connected stories. Playing as an Alien,  Predator, or low-rank Colonial Marine.Allows you to see your hands and feet (or tail in the case of the Alien)!When playing as the two titular extraterrestrials, it actually kinda feels like you're... well, in their claws! Subtle or less than subtle references to the movies.ConsThe Marines' voice acting isn't really the best, and their voice lines can get repetitive. As a first timer to the game, I found certain parts in the Predator campaign to be a little confusing, leaving me in the midst of aggressive Xenomorphs. Before I even played the game, I kept getting messages saying ""In order for Steam to run properly on this version of Windows, the Steam Service Component must be installed"". Otherwise, this shouldn't be much of a problem and doesn't really affect the game adversely.Overall, I found this game to be quite fun, especially when playing as the Alien and Predator.Buy if you're a fan of the series or simply want to take some human spines.

												A 2010 game that is still being played today.Now dont expect a long singleplayer since you can do it in pretty much one day.I finished it and I must say its a solid title to be honest.Now there could be more weapons for Marines and some more easter eggs but its no use complaining about this for a 6 year-old game.You can still hop into the multiplayer and have some online fun in some team-dm if thats what you're looking for.Currently there is 1 dedicated server that has a lot of players on it,but dont expect people to always be playing on it because of the timezone.I loved playing as the Alien because  well,youre a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ed alien what else do you want.The Predator is an absolute monster and you feel pretty badass while playing as one.While as the Marine feels like he walked into a Predator-Alien orgy and is wondering ""What the hell am I doing here?"".Jokes aside,you can still do some damage as a Marine and its nice to feel like you could be attacked from all sides all of a sudden.If you can wait for the sale snatch it and try it out.My final verdict is a 8/10.

												Aliens vs. Predator is a game that offers you 3 campaigns each following a different character through a derivative narrative.The Marine campaign gives you a shallow first person shooter putting you in the shoes of a rookie marine whom has crossed far too many black cats in his life.The Alien campaign gives you an interesting stealth adventure as an Xenomorph that managed to show some character and became the Teachers pet.The Predator campaign gives you a unique stealth/melee combat experience very reminiscent of the original movie.Or atleast on paper you do, in reality you get to experience one campaign through the eyes of a Marine an Xenomorph and the Predator. You traverse through the same levels time and time again making the game feel very slow at times.The game will constantly hold your through the marine campaigns and it is very linear but some of the Predator and Alien levels really open up and let you tackle the levels in a few different ways.The Ai in this game varies from good to bad. Sometimes the Xenomorphs will run along the walls and sneak up behind you making the game incredibly tense and atmospheric, Other times the Marine and Synth Ai will have Stormtrooper aim. This is even more prevelant in the Predator campaign, you are either constantly locked into a 1v1 melee battle with an Xenomorph or you are just stabbing it in the â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over while it runs away. I would say overall the Ai was decent but flawed in some aspects.The Campaign I enjoyed the most was absolutely the Predator one, it felt very unique and fresh to play. The only problem was a distinct lack of weapons to choose from, you get 4 weapons in total that would become available to you as you progressed and the standard melee attack. The game could have been so much better if they had chosen to add more weapons and gadgets to the Predators arsenal, It would have added much more needed depth and replayability. The Predator campaign had some terrible pacing issues, Towards the second half after a boss battle the game gives you his 4th weapon the combistick. This weapon allows you to one shot any Synthetic, Marine or Alien. This removes any need for Stealth or tactics and felt totally overpowered.The Marine campaign is the most mediocre of the bunch. Shooting the Xenomoprhs was satisfying but there wasnt much of a variety in weapons to choose from. It followed a strict formula of Run here, Shoot this, Cutscene the entire way through and felt incredibly repetitive and lackluster although it did definitely have its moments reminiscent of the Aliens movie. The Combat Synthetics you face are an absolute bore to fight, simply put they are just bullet sponges.The Alien campaign was the most flawed of them all. The only options it gave you to kill were luring somebody over, Sneaking up on them and grabbing them for a one shot kill, Or just beating them to death with light and heavy melee attacks. It also featured a harvesting system which was the most poorly executed aspect. Sneaking up behind a civillian allows you to trigger an animation that holds them down letting a facehugger jump on there face, This was cool to do the first time but it reaps no benefit in game and has only 2 animations.The game was not very hard to beat, Even playing on Hard difficulty most of the game was a total cakewalk. The game will hold your hand through the entirety of all 3 campaigns. I played all 3 campaigns in about 7 hours, the Marine campaign taking 3, the Predator another 3 and the Alien campaign being 1 hour long. Boss battles can range from a 5 minute slow grind to a 10 second sprint, Each providing no real challenge.For Â£10 I can hardly complain though, The game may be flawed in many aspects but it still offers you 3 Distinct playstyles, Great visuals and gory animations and Multiplayer with a bunch of maps. Final Score: 5.5/10 Nuke the site from orbit.			"

												As a huge fan of both the Alien's and Predator's franchise and of course the Alien vs Predator franchise, I decided to give this game a try and its actually not a bad game, for starters you get to play as both Alien and Predator and also as a marine which if you want the best gameplay as a marine, play in pitch black and listen to the motion tracker, being scared is the way to play it!Now the story is rather short with the Alien story being the shortest and the Marine story being the longest, but the gameplay for each of the faction's is great, as an Alien you can virtually walk on any surface and then leap onto your enemies with of course darkness being your greatest ally. As a marine you can be scared with your motion tracker and being ready to shoot anything that appears, but my favourite faction is obviously the Predator, you can jump practically anywhere, you can use the combi stick and all the other cool weapons that a Predator has equipped, but the coolest thing about the Predator is that you can turn invisible! and then use that to sneak up on enemies and take their heads as a trophy! Each of the faction's has unique collectibles as well as a Nightmare difficulty which if you die, there is no checkpoint so you must restart the level.The game runs really well from an optimization point of view, I was able to run the game at 60FPS! at 1080p with all the graphical settings including the Directx 11 exclusive options maxed out, unfortunately this game really suffers from screen tearing, even with V-Sync on the screen kept tearing constantly, more so for the Alien Campaign then others, but other then that the game is really good on PC.Overall i really enjoyed the game and have had lots of scary moments on the Marine campaign while having fun tearing them apart on others, If you are fan of the series i would pick up the game and have some fun with it, there is Multiplayer in the game but the servers are dead and the ones you can get into are filled with hackers, so if you do get the game then I would Stick Around! to having fun on the Campaign.

												Overall not bad. Graphics are decent for the time it was released. Gameplay is OK.Only real complaints:     single player campaigns seem a bit short and repetitive      the way it runs the cutscenes it's not immediately obvious you're in one except you seem to have lost control     you're almost herded into the proper direction and items are obviously highlighted so there's not the open exploration feel I got spoiled with in games like Skyrim.So buy it on sale and have a blast :)			"

												Alien vs Predator is pretty cool, I guess. Back in the 70's, a movie directed by Ridley Scott came out about a strange, phallic alien that drags people into it's disgusting poop caves. It's considered one of the greatest horror movies of all time thanks to terrifying designs and foreboding atmosphere. Thanks H.R. Giger, you twisted â¥â¥â¥â¥. In the 1980's, another movie was released about a team of crack commandos that could be the action heroes of their own movies being hunted down by a merciless alien killer who is practically invisible and sneaks up on you and tongues your butt. Directed by John McTiernan, it flipped the action hero genre on it's head and had a pretty cool fist fight scene near the end. Now Get this.What if...We made them fight! Alien Vs Predator is a long running comic book series turned video games series about the titular Aliens fighting the titular Predators. Set in the distant future where xenomorphs and Predators (Or Yautja if you're a huge nerd) fight one another while humans try to survive in the center of their little frenemy bromance. The Weyland-Yutani corporation, a stinky idiot corporation, is led by Karl Bishop Weyland, the stinkiest idiot. For a few games now, these stinky idiots thought that it was a not stupid idea to capture xenomorphs and try to turn them into bioweapons. This goes as well as you think and the xenomorphs escape to create new poop caves on a new planet.The predators, smelling the poop caves, and in return, spicey Alien butts to tongue, travel to the planet of BG-386 so that they can hunt both xenomorph and the most dangerous game...MAN, the spiciest of butts. Now with the humans at the mercy of both the alien poop caves and the Predator butt groping, a distress signal is sent out that is answered by the United States Colonial Marine corp, who's sole job is to clean up Stinky Idiot Corporation's messes and getting dragged into alien poop tunnels. You get three campaigns, which is a nice but the Marine campaign is clearly the most fleshed out. In the Alien campaign, you play as Specimen 6, an alien who is apparently the best and creating slimy poop caves and dragging poor humans to make more aliens in said poop caves. This campaign is more focused on stealth as you sneak around and beat up humans who are just doing their job and happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. You awful, awful monster.Predator campaign is a mix of both stealth and action, while you sneak around and beat up humans once again, every now and then the xenomorphs show up for a good butt tounging and you have to oblige them. The stealth in this one is also pretty cool, but the beat-em-up alien sequences kind of lose their luster really quick. It's not bad, but it's not that good either, it almost feels like an after thought, like they remembered that the Predator was there to tongue aliens butts last minute instead of just bullying humans. The Marine campaign, I will admit I enjoyed immensely. There's this foreboding sense of dread in every thing you do, especially during the first hour or so of the campaign. It almost feels like one of the original AVP games or even Aliens while you skulk around an apparently abandoned colony. You don't even see any enemies for quite some time until an alien decides to bully you, unlucky for them you are unbullyable and shoot the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ right in his little mouth. This being said, the campaigns are still rather short, especially the Alien campaign which can be completed in 2 or 3 hours or so. But enough about that, what about the multiplayer? AVP is known for it's online mode, with AVP 2 standing out from the rest of them in my opinion. Once again, you pick between Predator, Alien, and Marines in a fight for supremacy between yourself and the 20 or so Brazilian guys who still play this game. I ended up playing with a few fellow hobos. Out of all the game modes we ended up playing Deathmatch the most while one of us usually played as the marines, the others would pick alien or predator. The sense of dread stays with you as you play marines in multiplayer, only this it's your friends trying to eat you with their little mouths or bully your butt. But that sense of dread is quickly passed on to the alien and predator once the marine finds grenades or the smart gun. The melee...Works, I guess,  the alien and predator both have a strong attack, a normal attack, and a block, while the marine only has a block and a rifle butt to stop the alien from using his little mouth on you. You can block and counter normal attacks which knocks your enemy on their backs, but the block can be broken by a strong attack which in turn can be countered by a normal attack. This sounds alright in theory, but in practice, it's kind of janky, the first person view doesn't do much to help in this matter. The predator and alien can also lunge at you from a distance which can knock you down at the right angle. Alien players need to rely on speed and stealth, skulking in the shadows or camouflaging into one of their many poop caves that litter the maps. While predators can take a more patient approach with the use of stealth camouflage as well as their many gadgets like the spear, the plasma caster, or the stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥ing boomerang blade that NEVER WORKS EVEN IF I'M LOOKING RIGHT AT YOU ISNT THAT RIGHT DIBBIN Even with it's faults, the multiplayer is still fun and takes me back to my younger years when I would play the AVP2 multiplayer demo for hours, always picking marines because it doesn't feel right if my white undies aren't a strange mix of yellow and brown. It's fun to taunt and tease your friends as you hunt them, little mouth and all. But should you play Gayliens vs Redditors. Eh... Sure. It's basically the epitome of mediocrity. It's not amazing, but it's not offensive either. The online community is practically dead, you can find some games every now and then, but there really isn't a point to staying with it in the long run.  Get it on the cheap, no more than 5 bucks I would say. Mess with the single player a bit, play with a few friends, get your money's worth and then call it a day.Alien presents: To catch a Predator gets 2.5 slimy poop caves out 5. No, really, Alien biomass looks like a poop cave to me.Ridley Scott presents: Curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation "

												This is DEFINITELY a ""rated M for mature"" game, so don't let kids near it. That being said, it is as scary as advertised, bug-free for the most part (not entirely) except for xenomorph bugs (hee hee), & is a very very dark experience, as is the intended effect. It is a bit much to take in for more than a half hour or two at a time as it is somewhat depressing & sinister and so it is a bit of a downer. If you are in the mood for & are looking for sort of a newer-ish DOOM3 but with a team context and a somewhat realistic non-cheesy sci-fi feeling, you've come to the right game.The graphics are ""realistic enough"" to where you feel sort of immersed in the gameplay but the game can also even be played on older machines, as the new DOOM (Doom 4) can NOT. It is better than Red Faction: Armageddon, which seems cheesy & kidsy in my opinion. If you think the whole Aliens thing is super cool & scary you will be in to this sort of thing. The alien intruders are more scary & intense than the ones in Crysis 2. This game goes well with Taco Bell & a Full Throttle energy drink, as I just discovered for myself today.Negatives: No crouching is allowed, for some reason, & I don't know why, that is a tiny bit irritating. Especially the Alien's controls are optimized for use with a controller and so the keyboard & mouse use isn't as good. No biggie though. I think that things are maybe a little TOO dark for the Marines, in terms of plot, & that is a bit of a downer. There are no major gameplay flaws or crashes and it is a thing that works as intended & is pretty fun to boot.At this point there probably could be some new Alien-type thing out there that is better, perhaps an FPS Starcraft game or something, as the whole Aliens idea is a relic from the 80's. It is still pretty dope tho I think.Rating: 8/10. Worth playing. Would buy again. NOT for kids. Somewhat dated formula that folks seem determined to stick to & not update like in the way that the Call of Duty franchise is updated every few years.  "

												Hunter. Survivor. Prey. Which will you be?The deadliest species in the universe return to bring you mayhem in the jungles and swamps of planet BG-386. Here the Weyland-Yutani research team led by Karl Bishop Weyland discovered a Yautja Pyramid. They hope to unlock the advanced technology contained within and are simultaneously studying the Xenomorphs found there. Like always the Aliens find a way to escape, prompting a response from the United States Colonial Marine Corps, while the Predators also send three of their members to investigate.As with previous titles, Alien vs. Predator features three campaigns, one for each race (the Predators, the Aliens and the Colonial Marines). These campaigns are separate in terms of individual plot and gameplay, but form one overlapping storyline.

Following the storyline of the campaign modes comes the multiplayer aspect of the game. In the multiplayer mode players face off in various ways across various game types.PredatorLike in the movies, the Predator prefers to stalk its prey from the safety of treetops, the player leaps from branch to branch with the help of ""focused jump"". The Predator has different vision modes, an infra-red thermal imaging scanner that detects targets by their body heat and an alternate ultra-violet spectral range vision mode for spotting Aliens. Each vision mode only allows for targeting a specific race, for example: the thermal vision makes human and Predator targets obvious while rendering Aliens nearly invisible, making battles between two or all three species a tactical juggle to prioritize enemies based on their threat to the player. The game also incorporates a ""normal"" vision mode for gameplay reasons, which is comparable to typical human sight.Predator gameplay is more based on stealth and tactics than the average first-person shooter. The player has to be aware of their most worthy foe, the ""serpents"" (Aliens have the ability to see through a Predator's Cloak), while also trying to not reveal themselves to Marines too early, as the humans' weaponry and numbers are more than a match for the Predator. The player is able to utilize vocal mimicry to lure out human prey and make them easier targets. For long-range weaponry, the Predator is equipped only with the Plasmacaster, but over the course of the campaign manages to secure a Smart Disc, a Combistick and gets the ability to drop Proximity Mines. For close-range general combat, the Predator has two retractable Wristblades on each of its arms. Unlike many other games featuring the Predator, the creature's cloak does not consume energy when in use and can be used indefinitely, although it will automatically cut out when firing weapons or attacking an enemy. Energy is needed to power the cannon and mines, and must be refilled from recharge stations scattered throughout the levels when depleted. Health is recharged through the use of Health Shards, which can also be scavenged.With the Wristblades the Predator can perform a trophy kill, just like in the movies, where they take souvenirs (usually skulls) from their defeated enemies to show their prowess in the hunt. The trophy kill mechanic was labelled as so ""spectacularly violent"" that it was believed it would be cut from the final game to avoid an Adults Only rating in the United States as it was ""several measures more graphic"" than any other recent games. The majority of the Predator's trophy kills revolve around dragging its enemy off-balance, before impaling it with its Wristblades and decapitating it. AlienThe campaign begins as Specimen 6 in the Weyland-Yutani research lab. The player is made to attack human test subjects as a tutorial. The lab, however, gets hit by the EMP from the temple and the player rescues the queen and other captive Xenomorphs.The Alien campaign forces players to get in close to their enemy, as their only methods of attack are physical: the Aliens' claws, tail, teeth and inner jaws. The alien's sight is based around the use of pheromones, which enables it to distinguish between hostile prey and passive civilians (it can also deduce whether the Marines or the synthetic humanoids are alert and ready to fight, and is also able to see through the Predator's Cloak). Players can climb over every surface in the game as an Alien. In confined spaces, the wall-climbing can cause some confusion, but once mastered it's a powerful weapon in your Xenomorph's arsenal.Like the Predator, the Alien also has sort of a trophy kill system - firmly grabbing a Marine or android before either headbiting it or impaling it with the Xenomorph's tail. A Headbite on a corpse will recover all health, similar to a vampire, although the Alien's health automatically recovers fast enough anyway. If Specimen 6 comes across any civilians in its rampage through the Freya's Prospect colony (the colony in which this game is set), it can 'harvest' them to expand the hive, by pinning them down and attracting a Facehugger to them. Colonial MarineThe Colonial Marine campaign is far closer to that of a standard first-person shooter than the other campaigns, with the focus on ranged weaponry with only a light melee-attack to knock back Xenomorphs and Predators that get too close. The campaign is the only one in the game to include survival horror elements. Weapons available to the Colonial Marine you play include the iconic Pulse Rifle and Smartgun, as wells as pistols, shotguns and flamethrowers, along with the motion tracker made famous in Aliens. The key to the marine campaign is the sheer terror of facing off against the two movie menaces of the title. Most of the levels are also dark and very claustrophobic, forcing the Marine to resort to a torch and a supply of flares to combat the darkness that Xenomorphs are so fond of. Most of the cutscenes take place from the perspective of the player's character. Rebellion stated that the point of the campaign is to simply survive. The Marine campaign also contains the most information about the game's plot, the others simply feature conversations between Marines heard shortly before you rip them to pieces. Developed by Rebellion and published by SEGA in 2010, Alien vs. Predator was the best-selling game on Steam and on the PC game retail charts for that year.Two DLC map packs have been released, The Swarm Map Pack and Bughunt Map Pack. Both provide new multiplayer and survivor maps.As a long-time fan of both the legendary Alien and Predator science-fiction franchises and unlike some of the artists that worked in their movies, I was thrilled to see them clash and blown away by this sequel featuring distinctly new and hardcore FPS gameplay.

Aliens vs. Predator ReviewThe highly acclaimed British developer Rebellion is striving to scare the hell out of you again with the new Aliens vs. Predator game. Re-capturing the pulse pounding game play from the original PC gaming classic, players once again get to play three different campaigns from three different perspectives. Aliens vs. Predator is a thrilling gaming experience no matter what part of the campaign you play. The clash this time around takes place on the deep space frontier world being colonized by humans. There on the the colony on a far off planet an ancient pyramid is found. Of course, scientist and archaeologists can't help, but go exploring this historic find. This of course triggers the ultimate confrontation between Colonial Marines, Aliens and the Predators.The single player of the game is a rather unique playing experience. You can play any of the three species, each with strengths and weaknesses. The Colonial Marines, while rather fragile, they have a heck of a lot of fire power. The Predator has it's stealth and cloaking device, and the Aliens have the claws, the speed and numbers. Each character type requires a different skill to play to it's full potential. It all comes down to the skill of the individual players really.The Colonial Marine makes due with the human technologies, from pulse rifles and pistols and auto turrets to motion trackers. The over all feel of survival horror and thrill when dozens of Aliens start clambering at you from every possible angle is exhilarating. Moving along through the darkness with only your beam of light illuminating small portions of an area is such a thrill.The Predator is pretty awesome to play, I mean really who did not long for a game with this character after seeing the films? All the Predator equipment is at your disposal here, from the personal cloaking device which aids you in your stealthy approach to human targets, on to the unique ability to target a Marine and then throw a recorded mish mash of a voice to a point where the target will go investigate. This is perfect for luring target's out of a much more dangerous group. They will not fall for this tactic though if they are on alert. Predator also has it's view modes, each species has a special view mode that can spot them best. For instance if the player is in a view mode for hunting Marines, they have to take care because the Aliens are next to invisible in that mode. Getting around as the Predator is achieved by the standard running around...but what's fun is that the Predator has a focus jump mode - a circle representation of where you can jump to shows up, then hitting the right button and off you go. One would think the Predator would be the be all end all power player of this game, but there are things in place that balance it out pretty well. Some of the Predator's weapons have to be recharged, so just blasting away with the shoulder mounted plasma cannon is not advised.Playing the Alien campaign the player is the creature that the scientist named âSixâ - a poor captured Alien. The Wayland - Yutani company has some special plans for Six, oh the greed and nastiness of this company, who is the real monster here? Playing as an Alien requires a lot of tactical skill to fully utilize this character types natural defensive and attack capabilities. Claws, teeth and spiked tail and special senses. Sort of a natural enhanced sense mode that aids in seeing the prey. Blending with the darkness and easing in on a target is what the Alien does, or can attack in great numbers. Of course, the Alien can run along walls and ceiling, making it a very cool character to control indeed. As noted, darkness is your friend so, the Alien can also break light emanating sources, to plunge an area into darkness. Getting in close and personal is what the Alien does best. It's a good balance of character abilities and environment based survival abilities.Other than the atmospheric single player campaigns there are several different multi player matches to be had in the game and all of them have something different to offer:Deathmatch / Species Team Deathmatch / Mixed Species Team DeathmatchA staple of the online gaming, there are three variations of deathmatch featured in Aliens vs. Predator. There is the standard free-for-all deathmatch mode where no species allegiances matter. Youâre on your own here and itâs every man/extra-terrestrial for themselves. Species Deathmatch is basically team deathmatch. The players are separated into three teams based on the three species and pit against each other. Mixed Species Deathmatch is just what the name implies. There are two teams considering of each of the three different species. It adds an unusual element to the game due to the three different styles working together.All three modes are based around the usual deathmatch conditions. You or your team either achievements the frag limit to end the game, or the game ends after a certain time and the team with the most kills is the victor.DominationDomination is based very loosely on a capture the flag kind of mechanic. You play as either marines or Aliens. The objective is simple: To take and defend as many âControl Pointsâ that are scattered throughout the level. You accumulate points based on the amount of Control Points you have and how long you keep them. The victor is the one who reaches the score limit or the team with the most points when the time runs out.InfestationInfestation is a very similar mode to Survivor from Alien vs. Predator 2. Every player begins the match as a marine. One player is selected at random to become an Alien. That Alien then has to hunt down and kill the marine players. When a marine dies, he becomes an Alien. The game ends when everyone has been killed and turned into one of the Alien hive. For the marines it is key to stick together, to have all 360 degrees covered. As an Alien, you must stick to the shadows and use the heights to your advantage. It maybe hard at first but once you kill one or two marines, the rest will fall.Predator HuntLike in Infestation, all the players start out as marines with one randomly selected to be the Predator. As a Predator, you have a time limit in which to kill as many marines as possible. For each kill you make as a Predator, your score increases and as does your time limit. As you the marine, your job is to kill the Predator. The only way you can become the Predator is if you kill it or the time limit runs out and another player is selected at random to be the Predator. At the end of the match, the player who scored the most points as a Predator wins.SurvivorSurvivor is an online skirmish mode. With up to four players, you play as marines against never ending waves of AI controlled Aliens. As you defeat each wave, the next wave throws more Aliens at you, eventually you will face off against different and stronger variants of the Alien. The weapons on each map are limited, as is the space you have to escape the swarms. Itâs an enjoyable mode on your own but far superior with your friends. With only one life each, the game ends only when all marine players have been killed.VERDICT: Overall Aliens vs. Predator has succeeded in bringing to the table so much newness with an old concept. It just does not get old anytime soon in it's playability.Rating: 9/10 "

												I'm not a huge fps fan but I found this game pretty fun.I played the marine campaign first and enjoyed the atmosphere and tension. Some parts where you are fighting off swarms of enemies is pretty nerve-wracking. The boss fights against larger aliens and then predators are also well done. There's a decent selection of weapons and nice changes of locations (jungles, bases, the pyramid).I found the alien campaign less interesting. You have to focus on stealth and wait to pick off individuals who are alone as you can't take many gunshots.The predator campaign was my favourite. Although you have less weapons than in the marine campaign they are much more fun. Overall I'd give this a 7 out of 10- well worth buying for $5 or so when on sale.			"

												Aliens, Predators and Humans. Review of Aliens vs Predator for PC (2010). Compared with ACM (2013). Made by RebellionReleased in 2010----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Spoilers ahead. Aliens vs Predator is the latest AvP title from Rebellion. The first game was AVP (1999). The second was developed by Monolith and realised in 2001. The first version was improved (AvP gold) and can be purchased at steam. AvP 3 was released on february 19, 2010 in Europe and features three distinct story lines. You can play as Alien, Predator or Marine. It has no connection to the AvP films other that it features three characters and some familiar organisations like Weyland - Yutani. (tip: before you play this game, you should have seen the Alien films and/or played other Alien related games)Story and gameplay The story is mediocre. But it offers unique perspectives on the Alien and Predator franchises. Weyland - Yutani is the main 'villain' in this game. This game let you play as Alien, Predator or Human. - Compared with the story off ACM, this story is not quite as good. Because it has no connection to the films. ACM is better in this regard. The Alien is nicknamed 'Number 6' and you will try to escape the facility and return to your queen. In the end you must fight the Predator. The Predator is nicknamed 'Dark' and you will try to obtain a weapon that the marines captured. In the end you must fight the Predalien. The Marine is nicknamed 'Rookie' and you will try to unravel the secrets of Weyland - Yutani and fight deadly Aliens. In the end you fight with Mr. Weyland. The Alien campaign is the shortest. Crawling against walls and objects can be a bit difficult. You have no longe range weapons. You are the weapon. You can perform fatality moves with the 'E' button just like the Predator. You see with a 'fish - eye' perspective. The Alien can crawl into vents and airducts. The Predator campaign offers high - tech weaponary and is quite entertaining. You can perform fatality moves just like the Alien. You cannot crawl but you jump from tree to tree. You have the ability to cloak yourself. With your helmet you can view in three 'modes'. The Marine or human campaign is the longest. It is the standard FPS genre. You have weapons and you have a flaslight to illuminate dark areas. You are the 'soft' character, compared to Alien and Predator.- Compared with ACM, the campaigns are original and fresh. You can play different characters. AVP is better in singleplayer aspect. ACM does offer co - op campaign unlike AVP. Artifical IntelligenceThe A.I. of the game is very good. You can set your difficulty and the enemies will become tougher. If you play on the highest setting: only for die hards. - Compared with ACM, its a tie (difficulty settings). MultiplayerIf you play multiplayer, you will play team deathmatch. It offers the three main characters in a brutal war against each other. You can also play other modes like survival in which you fight waves of enemies. Just like other games (Left for Dead for example). - Compared with ACM, multiplayer is quite the same. It offers less modes but you can play as more characters. In-game bugs and screen tearing in singleplayer and multiplayer.There are no bugs - except the Aliens themselves - in this game. - Compared with ACM, there are no bugs or screen tearing. AVP is better. GraphicsThe graphics of this game are really good. If you compare this game to A:CM, AVP offers much more detail. With DX11 you will enjoy high end graphics. If you have a good pc you can play this game with maximum settings. Humans, Aliens and Predators look very good. Facial expressions are good. Lightning effects and environments are exceptional detailed. AVP is the best looking Alien game until now. - The graphics of AVP are much better then ACM graphics if you focus on detail. But ACM offers an 80's setting. If you like detail go for AVP. If you like 'old school' style and resemblance to Aliens (1986), go for ACM. All in all, AVP offers superb graphics. SoundThe sound of this game is really good. The Alien and Predator sounds are very good. But if you compare the sound of the weapons in this game with the weapons in Alien,  Predator or AVP movies, they are not the same. ACM offers better sounds. - If you compare the sound of this game to ACM, both are quite good. Although I prefer the sound of ACM weaponary. The sounds of the Alien in AVP are very good. Sounds of both games are good.ReplayabilityReplayability of the game is high because of the three distinct campaigns and the multiplayer options. It offers no co - op mode like ACM. - Both AVP and ACM offer high replayability if you are Alien fan like me. ACM offers co - op unlike AVP and more multiplayer modes. ACM wins. ConclusionAVP 3 from 2010 is a game that delivers the AVP universe in a fresh setting. Because it offers unique campaigns, you will play this game again. The graphics of this game are unique. Much better then ACM graphics. They are not so good like Crysis 3 for example, but they are still very good. The story of the game is mediocre. The latest installment of the AVP series offers superb graphics and animations, a mediocre story, good sounds, three distinct playable characters and fun multiplayer modes. AVP has better graphics then ACM, three campaigns with different characters and fun multiplayer modes. It is not movie related but it offers a decent story. All in all, AVP is not as good as ACM. Co - op, upgradable weapons and better multiplayer modes and DLC belong to ACM. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The good* Based on a existing franchise;* Very good graphics;* Three distinct stories;* Multiplayer and survival mode are very good;* Fresh and innovative gameplay. The bad* No co - op modes;* No upgradable weapons;* Less multiplayer modes compared to ACM. * No canon story. FINAL VERDICT: 7.5 out of 10.			"

												Aliens vs. Predator plays out similar to the same titled 2004 film Aliens vs. Predator, experience multiple campaigns with simultaneous events through the viewpoint of each the Colonial Marines, Aliens and Predators.   Each campaign brings unique perspective and gameplay to their personal journey as they fight for domination and survival.  Great play through for any fans of either Aliens or Predator franchise and or casual gamers.			"

												Great graphics and original gameplay come to add-up to the already top quality AvP series. The single player campaign keeps true to it's predecessors, with a suficiently cativating story to make it worth playing alone. The multiplayer also adds many new game modes (survival co-op being a great plus) that could keep you going for hours without notice. Changes to the combat system and controls make battles more diverse and bring up the game's pace, in such way it feels not only as a mere update of the late AvP 2, but gives the sensation of a whole new game (as every good sequel should). The only negative point would come not such from the game itself as from the community. Few weeks after launch, hacks were already common in multiplayer, spoiling much of the fun of online playing with strangers, and little changed as far as the last time I played. Anyway, if you have a group of friends of any size, the diversity of multiplayer modes makes up for the short commings of cheating players, giving you planty options to serve different numbers of players.If you like the prequels, or enjoy alternative shooters with original gameplay, fret not, it's worth the money.

												The Aliens and Predator franchises have had there ups downs, and when combined into films it was the ladder. In gaming however they really worked! Starting back in the Arcade as a âFinal Fightâ style beat-em up, the Atari Jaguar in 1994, the PC version in 2000, and a sequel in 2004. All were fun games for their time. So how does the latest in the series hold up? Well it helps if your a fan of Alien, and The Predator movies, and I am so my review may be biased. The game is broken into three campaigns that tie in the main story. Players can choose a Colonial Marine, the Alien, or The Predator. Each class plays very unique with their own abilities. The Marine campaign was my favorite, it captures some of the Aliens feel. There is a great line-up of movie weapons, tense scenes, and a lot of action. My complaints for the Marine are minor. I really wish they added âAim Down Sitesâ. Firing from the hip in gaming is just old school, I need my sites! Second complaint is the motion tracker, It's all but useless in the game. I know I'll get some heat for saying this, but Aliens Colonial Marines made far better use of the motion tracker. My second favorite campaign was The Predator. With all of his tools at your disposal, you will feel like an unstoppable hunter. My only complaint on The Predator is the âpred jumpâ. At times it can be a pain to line up, but once you know the map its less frustrating. The Aliens campaign was my least favorite. The Alien can transition to walls, and run in 3D. It has some interesting fatalities, and is extremely fast. However This is extremely disorientating in first person view, and I can't tell you how many times I ran right by an enemy because of the speed the Alien runs at. This could have been easily fixed if the Alien had 3rd person perspective. The game offers a decent amount of multiplayer modes, and a decent number of maps. The only thing I wish is there was a little more variety in the scenery. Your either in a Jungle, or a pyramid, and thatâs about it. The game will run on almost any PC if you adjust the resolution, and graphics options (Not your Apple II, but anything from 2010 and up should be fine). Overall this game despite its flaws is a very fun play, and I recommend it. If you've been passing on this one, and your a fan of either franchise you should pick it up			"

Multiplayer	First off, multiplayer isn't completely dead. Go to MultiplayerâPlayer MatchâBrowse Games, then change the Server Type to Dedicated (Internet) and press Browse. There are normally about 20 to 30 players on. Sometimes more, sometimes less.	With that being said, the multiplayer is pretty fun. There are a total of 7 game modes: Death Match, Species Team DM, Mixed Species DM, Predator Hunt, Infestation, Domination, and Survivor. Death Match	This game mode is your standard free-for-all death match, where your devotion to your species does not matter. Species Team DM	This game mode is similar to Death Match, but has 3 teams. Whatever species you select, either it be Alien, Predator, or marine, that will be the team that you fall into. Mixed Species DM	Like Species Team DM, this death match mode has teams, though you pick what team you fall into. This means you can have an Alien, Predator, and a marine on the same team. Predator Hunt	This mode, everyone starts as a marine, except for one randomly selected Predator. The Predator's job is to kill as many marines as possible in a short time limit. As the Predator does so, its time limit is increased and its score is as well. The marine's job is to kill the Predator. The only way to become the Predator is to either kill it, or have it run out of time and then another marine is randomly selected to become the Predator. At the end, whoever has the most points as Predator, wins. Infestation	Everyone starts as a marine except one Alien who's selected at random. The Alien's job is to kill the marines. Once a marine is killed, they turn into an Alien. The game ends once every marine has been killed and turned into an Alien. Domination	In this mode, you play either as marines or Aliens. Your goal is to capture and defend as many Control Points as possible. You gain points based on how many Control Points you have and how long you keep them. The victor is whoever reaches the score limit, or have the most points once the time has run out. Survivor	With up to 4 players, you and your team play as marines fighting a never ending swarm of AI controlled Aliens. With each wave you survive, the next wave throws more and different varieties of Aliens at you. The game ends once all marines are dead. This mode can also be played solo. 	NOTE: the only game modes that seem to be played online, is mainly Species Team DM and occasionally Death Match.Campaign	There are 3 campaigns for Aliens vs. Predator. There is marine, Predator, and Alien. Marine	Not much to say, seems like your average first-person shooter, except with far more horror and suspense. You face dark, claustrophobic environments with only a flashlight and a flare to guide you. The guns feel good, and the controls feel solid. Predator	Predator campaign has a real merit to it. You focus on eliminating marines and Aliens (obviously) using your weapon of choice. As you proceed through the levels, you gain more weapons to use, such as the Plasma Caster or the wrist blades. The jumping mechanism feels sturdy; easy to use and very handy. Overall, the controls are solid. The executions are gruesome, gory, and very fun to pull off. However, the fact that you cannot cancel the execution halfway through baffles me. If you are getting shot at by a marine or hit by an Alien, you can't cancel executions. This isn't game breaking, but can be annoying. This is also applies to Alien. Alien	The Alien hides in the shadows, eliminating it's targets (mainly marines) using stealth. Like the Predator, Alien executions are gruesome, if not more gruesome, but cannot be cancelled. Regardless, they are still fun to pull off. The controls for Alien feel clunky. Once you get used to them, they aren't too bad. Climbing onto walls can take a moment and camera angles, when moving on walls, are simply weird. Jumping onto walls is often easier than climbing, but despite the controls, the Alien campaign is definitely the weakest. Not bad, but not great.Verdict	Aliens vs. Predator is an action first-person shooter, with aspects of horror. The single player is a great experience and the executions are just brutal. Multiplayer is also quite fun, despite the low amount of players. However, finding a packed server is often easy. Overall Aliens vs. Predator is a great game, and well worth it. "

												I have been a avid AvP fan since the original game's launch back in 2000. And this iteration delivers a solid AvP experience with a beautiful graphics engine. My only real complaint is the lack of diversity in weapons seen in AvP 2. If your an Alien or Predator fan this is a definite purchase.Final Score: 85/100			"

												As a major AvP geek who collected the comics from the very beginning... I even had issue 0, I can safely say that this is the last semi-decent thing made in the franchise(EDIT: I have not played Alien Isolation). But... there are no surprises here and some huge disappointments. If you like to be scared, the human single player campaign has it's moments. If you are interested in the single player, give it a go. I think it's worth the money--if it's on sale. This was the game, by the way, that introduced me to Steam since it required a Steam account to play. Whether or not that's a good thing, I'll leave for you to decide. I never finished the campaign, however, because I just didn't find it that compelling. If you like the franchise a lot and for some reason haven't yet tried this game, maybe you should see what it has to offer yourself the next time it goes on sale.The reason I stopped playing, and my greatest cause for hesitation in recommending this title, is that the multiplayer is broken in terms of balance. When playing online, my typical experience as a player attempting to play as an alien would be that a few predators would essentially wipe the map clean in no time. Again and again. In order for the alien game to work in multiplayer, you have to have a well-coordinated team working together, like in the comics and movies. Otherwise you get what you have in the mp games online--too many predators, not enough aliens, or even marines. Also, I don't usually whine about cheats and hacks, but I have some concerns because of the (albeit limited) interactions I experienced online. If you have a large group of friends or a clan, this could be a lot of fun with clear limits set forth on how many players per species to keep things balanced and in proper ratio. So, with those concerns stated, If you like this franchise, give it a go if you don't think you'll mind the problems I've stated here. One more thing, the last few times I played online it seemed that the mp community was dying, probably for some of the very same reasons I've mentioned here. So you may or may not have much chance to experience online play depending upon the current state of that aspect of the game.			"

												The gameplay is fine enough, and the sides are definitely varied in ability and tactics, but the game does have a couple of issues.  The single-player campaign is very short, 5 missions of varying brevity per faction, and they aren't the best in quality.  The controls for the alien, especially if you have the auto-scale-walls option enabled, can take a very long time to get used to.  The multiplayer is almost dead - though there are people playing, it's comprised solely of those who have been playing this game non-stop since launch and are therefore much better than you ever will be.  If you want to be the allen there really isn't another modern option (Colonial Marines doesn't exist), but if you want to get it, get it cheap. 7.5/10			"

												1st I thought this is only a movie like Point and click, Episodic, Visual Novel and story rich, because this was a film. Then after I download this, it was actually a game!  A 1st person shooter, there are 3 campaign, Be a Marine? Alien? Predator? Each of it have their own individual story line. Predator can stealth, allowing you to stalk your prey by sneaking around the back of enemies. Predator also have different vision modes, which will seek out the other races very easily. Predator cuts the head of the Marine then they collect it.Marine have radars to detect stealth predator but runs out of ammo really quickly. Well I didn't play much of marines, because they are more simple. I think? Easy to die, runs out ammo quick, Aliens are very fast creature, they can climb through walls can stalk in the shadows and pounce on an unsuspecting enemy. They can't detect stealth predator eaisily. Not like Marines.The game was good, awesome graphic and enjoyable to play Multiplayer.			"

												This is not a bad game.The graphics, the gore and the gameplay are all fairly strong and well-implemented facets of what is a really solid experience (aside from the less-than-impressive implementation of the stealth). However! The fact that locations are recycled over all 3 campaigns is straight up lazy, uninspired, and disappointing. The further you go, the more you feel like corners have been cut, and you have been cheated. Although, I only felt this way because I wanted more, which says something really good about the game, yes?AVP2 is easily the best of the series, in my opinion. But if you can grab it cheap, this game is worth it for the spectacle.			"

The predator has a good campign but it has little story, it is also very gory. I tore a guys head and spinal collum out and slit someones throat so it definatley has a stealth driven campaign. Finally the marine campign. I liked it but didnt play again on all the difficulties like the predator. It plays well and has more than decent voice acting and amazing weapon sounds but you cant get close up to someone and rip their head off. Overall its a great game and I think any predator or aliens fan should own it.			"

												AvP is a really solid game, the single player has 3 parts in which you play as marine,alien and predator while the multiplayer is all the factions versues each other. I love the authenticity this game has the smart cannon feels like what it is and playing the predator is an absolute delight you really feel like youre playing as the predator as you have all the iconoic weapons and gadgets of the predator, the alien feels a bit out place as the controls can be a bit hard but the agility of the alien really makes up for any flaws.My biggest problem with the game is the developer chose to focus on the mp instead of the sp and the mp is really average at beast, the biggest problem the multiplayer is that the faction with the highest number of people group up and murder you in a few seconds after you spawn and the multiplayer just is not as engaging and fun to play because of that and is mediocre at best.The problem with the sp is that the levels are rehased in all the 3 campaings and there is absolutley no charcaters and the story basically non-existant.The rehased levels are somewhat to be expected but with the verticality of the 3 various races it doesnt feel that painful to go through it once or twice again.I recommed this game solely on the single player which is bare bones but is good if you want to expeirnce what a great game this could have been instead this is just an abover average game as the devs chose to focus on the multiplayer instead singleplayer, it could have been one of the best games of 2010 instead it wasnt and its a damn shame coz its pretty good.We have tacked on multiplayers in games these days but i wish this was the case here as had the focus been of the main 3 race campagin with a good story and strong characters this woudl have been a much better game.

												If you're familiar with AVP series, you'll most likely enjoy it. As a huge horror, sci-fi enthusiast, I loved every single campaign of AVP. They are kind of short (hourwise) yet still fun. Controls are a bit tricky as Xenomorph and Predator at first, but the physics, generally, are easy to understand. It has over 15 hours of gameplay which you'll have a blast. However, there is only one con: the multiplayer is completely dead.9/10			"

												TL;DR Fun as hell, but short.I am a huge fan of both the Aliens and Predator franchises, and as such I love the amazing games both series have to offer. This, is a game that combines both series, and does it quite well. The gameplay is rich, the story is cheesy but enjoyable (and really warrants a sequel if you ask me.) and the atmosphere is spot on. There are 3 campaigns to choose from, each broken into little missions. The terror-inducing Alien, the fearsome and formiddable Predator....and the puny marine. After beating a mission as one of these races, you have the option to play a mission from a different species, or continue the one you are on.Alien: The gameplay as alien is pretty fun, but challenging. You have to outsmart enemies, as you have no ranged attacks.  Stick to the shadows to stay hidden, climb on walls, ceilings, and through air vents (how original.) to get the jump on the poor marines below. You are the only species that has the ability to regen ALL lost health, and you can also heal by eating the heads of dead enemies. (Metal level: Over 9000)Predator: FUN. AWESOME. GORY. Nothing stands in your way. Slice through enemies as if they were paper mache arts-and-crafts projects made by 2-year olds. Use your heat vision to spot enemies, and use the xeno vision to spot Aliens. You can leap onto rooftops, sprint at a speed that makes Usain Bolt fall to his knees, and most of all, TURN INVISIBLE! My favorite species by far.Puny earthling: To be honest, kinda generic. Its basically CoD without ADS. Although, there are some genuinly scary moments, such as going through areas with eggs. (FACEHUGGERS.) You do get a motion tracker that is always on screen (Not lore friendly! Uh-oh!), but it is more useful that the versions, in say, halo. In this game, your motion tracker makes noise when spotting movement, so you can focus what is ahead of you, rather than dart back and forth between your tracker and the reticule. The only real mechanic that breaks away from generic FPS formula is the smart gun. It automatically tracks and homes in on targets. Sweet. Just wish it saw more use. But, all-in-all, this is MUCH better than Colonial Marines, and this isnt even the real focus of this game. Says alot about gearbox, doesnt it? Conclusion: Buy this game. Please. Do youself a favor.			"

												Overrall it's a pretty good game. Loved the graphics and the atmosphere, I've had a lot of fun playing all three campaigns. A few stupid things here and there but not enough to hamper the good experience.The game doesn't feel very long and it's the same maps all over again with the three species, in part it's unavoidable but a little more variation and lenght would have been appreciated.The Alien is probably the best and simplest campaign where you have the most fun. You are considerably more vulnerable than the previous games and you have to be careful not to get killed because the Marines have a lot of firepower, you have to rely on stealth and speed more than brute aggression.The Marine campaign is pretty immersive, although in some points it gets too tough, particularly in the temple bridge part where you have to keep at bay a huge wave of aliens and two praetorians and you're slow as a turtle and the sentry gun is almost useless. With the smart gun you can't run, so if the aliens get past your fire barricade it's game over in a moment. I could only beat that part on Easy, and barely.The Predator campaign is pretty great too but some things just don't cut it (ha-ha). The plasmacaster has become virtually useless since it does a lot less damage, without the auto aim it's hard to hit anything and it drains like HALF of your power reserve for a full, aimed blast. The prox mines from the AvP2 movie are nice, but the Marines will see them if you throw them in their visual fied. The disc is funny too but it no longer has auto aim, programmers shouldn't expect you to keep your aim straight when you're being attacked from all sides. And the spear is... simply overpowered, it can take out any normal target even from pretty far away.The one thing that irritated me both in the Alien and Predator campaigns is the long killing moves when people are shooting at you, isn't it kind of stupid for the Pred to look how beautiful a severed spine is when the victim's friends are taking you apart? Or even worse the long fatalities on the Aliens while you're being cut to shreds from the other Aliens that you didn't know were there, and you're helpless to defend yourself as long as the cutscene isn't finished. I got killed a lot of times in this manner. At least they stopped giving the Pred an unlimited amount of energy and medipacks, it made him way too strong.I rate it 8 out of 10.			"

												For fans of AvP universe this position is a must have. For everyone else? Well...First of all - the game has a nice story to it, unveiling itself through three separate campaigns. There is Lance Henriksen playing You know who, whose voice You'll be hearing throughout the game. Arsenal of weapons for each race is as it should be - nothing fancy and new - everything You already saw in movies.All three campaigns use the same locations. It can be boring to see same places over and over, but You will navigate them differently, as every character moves differently. Most maps are too narrow and You can feel lack of depth and choice to pass them through. AI can sometimes be immensly stupid, be it xenos, androids or humans.Now, for 100% You will have to play multiplayer. It's almost dead, but don't look for games in lobbies - go to servers and search there. You will need many friends playing to get all cheevos though.			"

												As a single player FPS, this game is about 15 hours of non-stop fun. I'm sure it's even more fun if you're familiar with the three movie series: Alien, Predator and Alien vs. Predator, and their sequels. The game shows a lot of respect for the lore established in those movies and expands a little on it. The aliens and predators look great. The music and sound effects are spot on. I found it impressive how the storylines of the three campaigns (marine, alien, predator) are nicely interwoven. As you can imagine, the way to play each campaign is completely different depending on the species you play and their weapons and skills, but each campaign even has a different HUD that really fits the species, which adds to an already immersive experience. You can adjust the difficulty to fit your play style and your (in)experience with FPS games. You can play the game with a gamepad, but I'm not used to the 'twin stick' thing where one stick moves your character and another stick moves the camera. So I quickly switched to mouse and keyboard, which was a lot smoother for me. You can bind keyboard keys for each species seperately in the options menu. I haven't tried multiplayer but I gather from other reviews that multiplayer for this game is dead, so if you're looking for a good multiplayer FPS, I suppose you need to look elsewhere. This also means that steam achievement completionists will have a hard time because 12 of the 50 achievements require multiplayer action.All in all, I'd recommend this game to anyone who reads this because that means you're at least remotely interested in FPS games or in the movies this game is based upon. But since three single player campaigns of about 5 hours each is all you'll get out of it, I would advise against paying full price for the game and instead waiting for it to be on sale.			"

												I really enjoyed playing the Predator and the Aliens campaign, because I havenât experienced that kind of gameplay in any other game yet. Everybody who likes a mix of horror and action should play Aliens vs Predator.Given the garbage most fans have had to go through in recent years, including one luke-warm Aliens vs Predator movie, this is a welcome addition to the series.The controls for Predators and Xenomorphs may be a bit tricky and the AI sometimes doesn't show any ""Intelligence"" at all, but nevertheless: AvP is a must-have for fans of the movies, as well as the games - especially if you're into absolute multiplayer-mayhem and dont mind ""some"" gore.Overall Aliens Vs Predator has succeeded in bringing to the table so much newness with an old concept. It just does not get old anytime soon in it's playability.			"

												My time played explains it all...the only down side is the (now) small multiplayer community. Great game that i would recommend to anybody. To the point, this game's single-player is quite short for all sides and the predator's missions almost entirely revolve around Xenomorphs which, i'd rather kill humans then Xenos any day. And the game is quite easy, but it is considered without replayability which while mostly true, i found that if you use different strategies it makes it much more replayable especially with stealth involved (Hard to be stealthy in Marine campaign).Pros:-Nice graphics for 2010-Awesome finishing/stealth kills-CoD/Halo like Marine gameplay-Awesome lightingCons:-Semi-replayability-Minor bugs/glitches-(Now) Small multiplayer community-Short campaigns (beatable in like 30 minutes if your quick for each campaign)Overall: 8/10 (as is)            9.5/10 (when Multiplayer community was huge)			"

												A very entertaining game, that some critics panned without giving it a fair chance. The single player is not very lenghty but it compensates for that  with variety, offering the possibility of playing with 3 unique and completely different species, meaning specific gameplay mechanics for each of the characters. As a Marine you have a tipical FPS experience, but with a very high amount of tension and atmosphere that gets to the nerves of those of you with a faint heart, and is no slouch in action as well, as hordes of enemies are lurking around almost every corner. As a Predator you feel like you are a total badass, with all the arsenal and gizmos we all know and love. It is especially gratifying to stalk your prey from afar, distract it and then lure it to it's untimely demise. As the Alien, you have to rely on speed and surprise to ambush your prey. As a totally melee based specie, you need to stick to the shadows and pick your battles carefully, but it is possibly the most gratifying of all the species you can choose from in this game, it relies mostly on skill and less on acessories (by acessories I mean weapons).It is far from being perfect though, the game suffers from a huge amount of glitches that were never properly patched and fixed by the developer (Rebellion), and if you plan to play this game online versus other people... You are in for a huge dissapointment. The amount of hacking and glitching in this game is fairly high, and the AvP community despite being small, it is one of the worst uneducated, childish and ridiculous group of children you will likely to ever meet. I recommend this game for it's single player mostly, and if you can get a decent group of people to play with you on fair matches, the MP can be a lot of fun, with the modes Species Team Deathmatch ( 3 teams, one alien, one predator and one marine), Mixed Species Team Deathmatch (2 teams, all species allowed in each of them), Predator Hunt (one player is a Predator while all the others are Marines. The Marine who kills the Predator becomes the hunter and therefore has to try and kill the Marines; Highest scoring player as a Predator wins), Infestation (one player is an Alien, all other marines, the Alien player must kill the marines; When a marine dies he then respawns as an alien to try and kill the remaining humans) and Domination (two teams, one alien and one Marine fight over the control of checkpoints in the map).Also worthy of mention is the co-op, there is a mode in the game called survivor, in which you fight waves of unending Aliens as a Marine with up to four people, and it can be a huge challenge, and it's fairly fun as well. I recommend this game mostly for it's single player, the three different campaigns are unique, even if they are a little short. MP can be fun, but try to stay away from public servers. The rage, hacking and glitching is usually big on those places. The Good-Three different campaigns, and three different perspectives on the same story-Good visuals and sound, particularly the sound effects-Lance Henrikssen as Bishop-Trophy killsThe Bad-Glitches are abundant on MP-Hackers are common on public servers-Most of the AvP community are raging 10 year olds7.5/10			"

												I was very excited to play the Aliens VS Predator for the first time ever and it met my expectations to allow me to say its a good game. The enviornment is very well detailed, gameplay is accurate to the films, same with the sounds, campaigns are extensive and are well done; especially the Marine campaign.Let's take a look at the negatives: The voice acting feels uninspired, AI on the marines is terrible, limited multiplayer content without the DLC maps, Multiplayer seems to be effectivly dead (and yes, I do have the dedicated servers installed, stop yelling at me.), only 2 survival maps without DLC, Predator's and Alien's cheap combos/moves in multiplayer, no female marines in multiplayer, cannot cancel executions (this leads to alot of cheap deaths in multiplayer since the animation takes 7-10 seconds to complete).Despite all the game's negatives, Its still very good. I got it for $3.79 while it was on sale. I also bought it as a gift for a friend, and he loves Aliens Vs Predator.I rate Aliens VS Predator with a 7/10         Until next review!                 Let's form up! ~Stealth 1548			"

												Aliens Vs Predator is a pretty good game predator has a good story line and it is very fun to play with his skillset and alien is fun af.Marine campaign is fun if you like a more challenging campaign / survival shooter (on marine hardest difficulty).The only down side to this game is that the multiplayer really fun when you can actually get a game however sadly multiplayer is dead because the game has been out for so long i had hoped that the sale would've brought the multiplayer back to live however it is still almost impossible to get a game.I'd give it a 8/10 for story and how much i enjoyed the campaigns but the multiplayer is not playable and lets the game down (unless you want to wait an hour to possibly get a game)			"

												Very fun single player, with each faction having pretty unique mechanics. I would consider the Alien faction the most unique but the other two had their moments.I will say they are fairly short, but I would say you could reliably get 10-15 hours if you are playing a difficulty that is challenging to you. With that in mind, you may want to wait for a sale.			"

												I don't much care for the human campaign and the Predator one was iffy but if you're a big fan of alien and want to go around taking out humans this is pretty fun.  You even get to fight a Predator squad and then a Predalien towards the end.  I remember playing all the way through on PS3 and having a lot of fun, but I was disappointed with the Predator story.  Not a great game if you were looking for a good Predator game where you get to be an awesome hunter killing things looking for Xenomorphs.  Overall I'd say get it if you're big into Alien but not if you're bigger into Predator.  The human bits are just an average shooter with barebones and stupid Xenomorph AI so that's not that great either.			"

												Yes, i would totally recommend it, 'cause it's a good game that was made with gameplay on the 1st place. Levels are vast and well-lit. Well, well-lit for the overrun with aliens facilities. Everything in this game is big and bulky so it ""reads"" perfectly. Guns are neat and every one of them has its purpose. I didn't even notice how friendly the motion detector is and took it for granted. The screen of it's pretty big and it doesn't require you to select it every time you would like to check on it. As far as FPS goes, it's a very good one with barely noticeble old-school qualities to it, mostly in visual design and story department. Opposite to the modern games it doesn't try to be a movie and sticks to the immerse gameplay.The alien controls perfectly, it moves very fluidly so it's like fliding on the surfaces, it may cause a little dizziness, but the freedom of movement it provides is outstanding. Alien's very sleek and its stealth gameplay suits the creeper.The predator's kinda dull (""Me's big and strong, me kills for da fun, Grrrr!""), but may be it's because he's not my favourite.Overall story is pretty interesting, but not too complicated so you can't track things down, it doesn't annoy you with its presence and generic as it is it has some creative details.Multiplayer mode's ok, every specimen controlls well, but marines, IMHO, too slow for the multiplayer action. Their slowliness is good for singleplayer, but in deatmatches they feel sluggish.Overall it's 8/10 for me.			"

												While far from the best Alien or Predator game this is a very solid effort, as usual the marine campaign and gameplay is best with the alien being to slow(since it was released on consolses as well). And the predator campaign being to easy.The games bigest flaw is over focusing on the melee system, it is hillarious to block enemy attacks as a marine vs an alien. haha you canot touch me while i hold this rifle infront of 10% of my body			"

												Avp Its awesome FPS based on alien and predator movies. At game we are able to play 3 different Campagains: Marine, Alien and Predator. All of them are awesome and brings a lot fun playing them. Game difficultys give more or less chalenge. Graphic is also very good and levels are amaizing, you can feel that atmosphere of the surronding environment.The worst part of game is multiplayer, it is at bad performance, cheaters kiling your fun and some actions shoud be remove from some fractions. Like a ultra speed runnig to xenomorphs and stealth kills at the back or plasma-spam-jump for PredatorsI reccomend that game highly because of the Singleplayer. It is nessesery for anyone who likes Sci-Fi FPS. "

												such a brilliant game, especially playing as aliens.  its currently dead sadly. thumbs up for the game itself, including multiplayer. Pros:+ 3 Playable races (aliens for stealth, crawling and leaping from walls to ceilings) (Predator, Stealth and Massacre, variety of weapons) (Marines, well. just guns and enemy radar)+ Multiplayer is great! especially playing as alien, eliminating humans  from the shadows.+massive replayability!+ Multiplayer progression! earn visual characters of each raceCons:- Marine story is very difficult and long, and boring.- Alien running around from wall to wall can get very confusing, end up running into a foe.- Predator in multiplayer is too broken.  too tough to eliminate (alien players, stay away from him.  marines, git gud)- Multiplayer is dead, (some servers are still alive but its not worth it)I'm hoping there would be a remake of this game, or hell! a game focus on playing as the Aliens!

												6.4/10 - Fast Paced FPSOverall, I like this game. Most of the maps are dark and hard to see though. I hate using a flashlight,, etc. The graphics are good though, and the story is well done. There are 3 shorter in length campaigns on this game which is pretty cool. One for each race including: Marines, Aliens, Predators! Multiplayer still had a few servers floating around which is impressive. I wouldn't pay $8-10 unless specifically an AVP fan.

												In my honest to god opinion... THIS is what a game should be... It was tense at parts, scary at others, and thrilling everywhere else.  If you were a human, you need them damn flares to see them damn alien, or if you're super unlucky, a predator.  As an alien it is too much fun to run around killing all the humans in the worst ways, especially the unarmed ones! Finally as the predator, YOU ARE KING OF THIS JUNGLE, THIS IS YOUR GOD DAMN SHIP! You are a God to these plebs and they should worship you! Anyhow the easiest mode is probably predator, followed by alien, and last and unfortunatly least the petty humans and their silly guns and toys and whodingys... Ah the screams.... Great Game.  9.2/10I cannot stress how much fun I had in this game... Oh my god... SO MUCH FUN.			"

												*Clears throat* I like it.No, really, though, if you're, first of all, a fan of the whole ""Aliens vs Predator"" universe, then you're going to love this game. If you're not? You'll probably love it even more!This game may seem short, (Perhaps)unoriginal, fast paced, etc. n' such, but by all means! It's not!This game has so much more potential to it than most realize! Now, by saying this, I am of course referring to my OWN opinion - Yours is YOURS and all that.Come, let's go over a few things;Graphics; The graphics ain't the best I've seen for a game released in the year 2010, but nevertheless delivers! The graphics are still astonishing, still incredibly detailed, but in it's own way, own pace, so to speak.It does have it's moment of mind-blow-itis, yes - It does have it's moments of .... Disappointment, but doesn't every game have containment of such? Come on! If you're not sure, then look it up! Youtube, people! Max settings! Gaming on the Pc Friday night with a bag of your favorite chips and some Mountain Dew, curtains closed, doors closed - absolute silence - absolute darkness. Only focus; The game, and surviving it, you'll try- ohoho! If you want a challenge, then put it on Nightmare difficulty and you'll have yourself a nice evening, trying to complete the 3rd level over and over again, thinking of dozens of ways, strategies to complete that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ level!.... It's an amazing experience, or at least for me; I enjoy difficulty in my games, but hey, there's always easy, or medium for that sake.Anyway! Back to the matter at hand! The graphics are overall good, nothing too fancy-smanchy, nothing too... Ew. The game itself doesn't require your computer to be top notch - A decent computer will do just fine on high settings! The visuals, environment n' such is what really gives me that 'tip of the iceberg' feeling! Ugh! Amazing! Haha! Now, I've already been writing too much on the topic of graphics alone! I might shorten this down.. another day at another time, hehe...Gameplay;Ohohoho! Awqh! I can't express it with mere words! You can basically play as all three parts known to the universe! What really amazes me is how every and each campaign has it's own uniqueness! Every campaign felt like a whole different genre overall! In general, yeah, it was all about the same thing, sometimes had to do something that seemed equal as opposed to the other campaigns, but it didn't ruin the expericence! Because with every campaign, you were playing as another 'part'! A.K.A being! *Sigh* Words are so hard to find these days, and people prefer to rather skip the long ones. If you're still here; thanks, I appreciate the time you've used to read this 'review' of sorts. Let's do it like this;- The Marine; Frightening, thought-provoking, creepy atmosphere (undergoing the section scary, I suppose) , shocks here and there, intriguing, and best of all; Aliens! If you're new, oh... You'll love them little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, ha! The rush you get when shooting them in the head, ah! Wondrous!The Predator; Bloody, intriguing, thought-provokin- Aw! You know what? F**k this! xD This review is already way too long! My hands hurt and, well, honestly, based on what I've been telling you so far, aren't you the least more tempted to buy this game? It's WELL worth the money. I promise you; even if you're unfamiliar with the whole thing, theme, universe! You won't be bored, you will not be disappointed! I might make this longer as time pass, but right now, I'm beat! It is currently Saturday noon and I'm devastated after yesterday's late night awesomeness, gaming you-know-what. *Wink wink* Okay, I'll stop.I hope this not even half-done review will make you buy this game, hell! At least consider it!This is Perspective, signing out! Peace! Long live the queen! (LV-426, that's all I'm saying)There is so much more to cover, but hey! I did my best in the condition I'm in.*Sigh* I need some re->zZZzzzz...Edit; This review is old, but shiiit, I still agree with myself on most parts!			"

AVP(2010) is a pretty awesome AVP game , but i personally want more.i mean ... for me it was really really short ( i mean the Singleplayer campaign itself , i invisted a lot of time in Multiplayer )  Alien campaign is weak and the worst of the three. Predator has a  pretty awesome campaign and the Marine has the best. The Multiplayer  is often played ( today you can still find servers with full players ) , and not THAT bad ( expect the Hackers , Plasma spammers , tail spammers and other cheating stuffs ) Pros :-6 hour campaign with 3 playable character-Predator is awesome-Marine campaign is awesome-The graphics look superb!-Multiplayer is ton of fun! Bad Things :-Alien Campaign ( not the Alien itself ) is weak. I want a good Alien campaign too!-Multiplayer is often ruined by cheaters , hackers.-Many multiplayer gamemodes are dead. -Noone plays Survivor :/// ( wich is my favourite game mode )7/10			"

												Being new to this game after playing the first 2 ""Aliens vs. Predator"" PC games, I actually found this game to be pretty enjoyable.  Granted, it isn't quite as good as the original 2 games (especially that of ""AvP 2""), it still was brillantly done in its own right.  Not much of a multi-player type person, but the single-player missions can be extremely intense in many parts.  So i'd highly recommend this game whether if you're into multi-player matches, or if you just like the exploration and storyline aspect of the single-player campaigns.			"

Underrated.I really don't see why this game is so underrated. Yes, it's different from the previous AvP games, but that doesn't mean it's a bad. Yes, the story could be much, much more interesting, but you don't need it, when you can become a bloody predator! Yes, the AI isn't brilliant, and that is a big con. Yes, multiplayer isn't perfect, but the game has a lot to offer nonetheless. Beatiful graphics, nice gameplay, good level design - you will not be able to stop playing until you finish the story.PROS:  Species Description   Marine Classic modern shooter/horror. Nothing extremely bad, but I don't have much to say about it.   Alien I am an alien! Hssss...   Predator Unless you play on easy/normal, you really need to think fast when you are fighting aliens. Killing humans is still easy - hard difficulty doesn't make them any more intelligent. CONS:  Species Description   Marine Hmm... Could be more interesting if they added features like welding doors, working in team (with good AI, of course), installing/controlling turrets, etc.   Alien Gameplay is repetitive. They could add evolution egg > facehugger > chestburster > queen and realistic hunting without this whole press E to win, and with good enemy AI.   Predator Gameplay is interesting only on hard and hardcore. Humans are stupid as hell, and aliens are weak. The multiplayer is unpolished, but it still is somewhat fun to play.

												I had very low expectations when I started playing this game simply because of the fact that we have had so many Alien related games that failed to meet expectations. This game surprised me though and it's able to have enough variety with it's 3 separate campaign modes. Having said that, each campaign is fairly short with each one clocking in at about 2 hrs or so. It can also be frustrating to control the Xenomorphs in the Alien campaign due to the fact that much of it is based in tight corridors. Meanwhile, the Predator and Marine campaign are both solid. As a whole, AVP is somewhat fun but flawed experience. It's not a great game by any means but it's also not terrible.			"

Underrated.I really don't see why this game is so underrated. Yes, it's different from the previous AvP games, but that doesn't mean it's a bad. Yes, the story could be much, much more interesting, but you don't need it, when you can become a bloody predator! Yes, the AI isn't brilliant, and that is a big con. Yes, multiplayer isn't perfect, but the game has a lot to offer nonetheless. Beatiful graphics, nice gameplay, good level design - you will not be able to stop playing until you finish the story.PROS:  Species Description   Marine Classic modern shooter/horror. Nothing extremely bad, but I don't have much to say about it.   Alien I am an alien! Hssss...   Predator Unless you play on easy/normal, you really need to think fast when you are fighting aliens. Killing humans is still easy - hard difficulty doesn't make them any more intelligent. CONS:  Species Description   Marine Hmm... Could be more interesting if they added features like welding doors, working in team (with good AI, of course), installing/controlling turrets, etc.   Alien Gameplay is repetitive. They could add evolution egg > facehugger > chestburster > queen and realistic hunting without this whole press E to win, and with good enemy AI.   Predator Gameplay is interesting only on hard and hardcore. Humans are stupid as hell, and aliens are weak. The multiplayer is unpolished, but it still is somewhat fun to play.

												It's an alright game but its way to short you could problay complete the 3 campaigns in about 5-6 hours. It holds up well for a 2010 game. the only issue I had with it is the AI, they are so dopey. Aliens would sometimes run around in circles and do predictable patterns, one of the bosses in the predator campaign is a downright joke and with the predator cloak ablity I was getting spotted from far out which didn't make any sense since with the alien you could pretty much sneak up to marines and tickle them. I didn't try the multiplayer due to the fact that it's pretty much died off, and the people left playing are either hackers or badmins according to the forums. (Inb4 someone comments saying it hasn't and it has its peak time and thaangs.) So if you haven't played 2010 aliens vs. predator before I recommend you pick it up if its cheap enough and if you want a laugh head over to the forums and watch people claim there clan is the best in a dead game. Pro tip bois: this isn't an Esports game.			"

												If you feel cheated by Aliens: Colonial Marines, you better buy this!Aliens vs Predator while it is an old game, the graphic is still the best there is! Not only it give the sensation of the creepiness and the horror of it, it give you lot of action and at least, the AI is not that stupid! They still move around, try to avoid you, and strike whenever they have the chance. The Single player although the story is short for each faction, it give a continuous story as  one story so it's interesting. The multiplayer give you alot of action and challenge!Play as the marine if you want to try the horror of the game as Aliens try to swarm you and Predators want to take your head! Play as Aliens as you make your way into Marines and then stab them or eat them on the head. Or chase Predators as the role of the hunter became reverse. The Hunter become the hunted! Play as the Predator as you hunt the marine to reclaim honour of the sacred place or brawl with the Aliens to prove your worthy of the Hunter!Buy this game now and you will not regret it!			"

												:: Welcome to another game of the ""Aliens vs Predator"" franchise ::  Let me answer the most popular questions for this game. - Why would anyone play or purchase this game?Owners of this game simply purchased this game for an addition to their ""Aliens vs Predator"" games on PC but with updated graphics, gore and playback value. - Where is the fun in this game?Unlike most FPS (First Person Shooter) games, there are three different species (Marine,  Alien, Predator) to choose and play the single-player campaign as. All individual specie campaigns have different goals and missions to complete, but throughout their campaign the main plot/story will be connected.  [ This game is not a continuance to the movies or comic books]  - Can you play this game online?Yes, there are co-op, death and species matches with various maps to play with friends or others online.The popularity of playing this game online is very low due to not enough maps available or players joining games.  - What??? This game is not popular for online gaming? Why? Although this game provided new updated graphical changes for the ""Aliens vs Predator"" game series, this game lacks in movement and control. To elaborate on this, the ""Alien"" specie is known for its agility to run and leap from walls, however this game provides a slower attack and jump speed than previous games. Similar problem is with the ""Predator"" specie controls and movement when switching weapons or visual displays while combating. ( As a ""Marine,"" rapid fire from any weapon seems slow and cause less damage on enemies. Even head shots are ineffective at times during game play.) - Now what?Play and purchase this game if you are a fan of the Sci-Fi Horror genre, but don't forget to get your parent's permission first.

												One of the most underrated games of all time with fast gameplay and smooth grafics. The lack of colectables may cause some to stay clear of this game, becouse you can only unlock skins and cosmetics but not weapons. There are 3 ,,classes'' to chose from.Alien: The fast, brutal and wall runing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s with their infamous E grabs.Predator: The stealthy, laser shoothing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s which everyone loves.Marine: Da guyz wit gunz.There are different campagnes with every race, which are good, but the real meet of the game is the multiplayer.With good maps ajusted to every race; Dark corners where aliens will eat your face off, open areas where Da guyz wit gunz will shoot ya, and trees and forests for the stelthy predators.The MP can feel chaotic at times but strategies are not missing, but most players just kill everything that moves.The hand to hand combat needs skill to be done correctly and can be action packed.I RECCOMMEND this game.8/10 IGN, Gaben overlawd.

												People actually hate this game? Are you nuts?Okay, lets back up a sec.Lets talk about what it gets right.Visuals are crisp and great to look at, the enemies look how they should and the enviroments are filled with a dark foreboding atmosphere that fits the two franchises very well. The Xenos and the Preds are represented faithfully to the source material and the setting and story are actually better than the first AVP movie. Yes the occasional AI teammate is painfully stupid and much of the voice acting is terrible. But it makes up for that with challenging difficulty and a short-but-sweet set of campaigns for each side. Multiplayer is alot of fun, it is terribly unbalanced and many times unfair but if you can look past that the multiplayer itself is fun to play. Overall this game is a decent addition to the franchises. Much better than a certain abomination made by Gearbox...			"

I found most enjoyment from the campaigns out of loving the aliens movie and the universe. the multiplayer is where the game really shines in my opinion with alot of game modes to choose from and some pretty good maps, my favorite is survivor but with the 2 maps the game comes with its gonna get old pretty fast (without the dlc). grab some friends and have alot of fun but if they make a new one they have to stop blaming weyland yutani for EVERYTHING!!!! if you want a good multiplayer experience with really good graphics, excellent lighting, great sound and perfect atmosphere this is your game. 60%P.S new Marine futuristic design is awesome			"

												AvP 2010 has very haphazard opinions if you google it on the internet. The general consensus of the title is that it's alright, but could have been better had the developers spent more time on it.The single player portion of the game is where it shines the most. The three campaigns are alright, though their length is a primary concern. All three wont take you very long to complete, and this is particularly jarring since the previous two PC games AvP and AvP2 both had very long campaigns.The biggest problem with this game is in it's multiplayer. The races are absurdly balanced, to the point where it's not enjoyable for anyone. The Predator is an overpowered demigod, the Marine can knock away Xenomorphs and the Alien is a fragile speedster that is fragile as â¥â¥â¥â¥. This is possibly the biggest sin this game committed since AvP2 had amazingly good balance for it's three races. If you end up finding yourself in a multiplayer game all that ends up occuring is players spam the melee counter button.Add in the lack of modding support (something that added longevity for AvP2), and lack of dedicated servers (For a series previously renowned for it's multiplayer clans) all you have here is one of the biggest examples of wasted potential. AvP2010 depresses me moreso because of how average the game is, and had they spent more time on it the game could have been the greatest in the series.Thankfully it still isn't as bad as Colonial Marines.

												This game for people who like Aliens film and Predator film, maybe Predator 2 film.  All other film like Alien versus Predator is solid camel â¥â¥â¥â¥.Single player is 3 game in one.  Very good deal in market.  In first campaign you play as marine shouting ""Game over man!"" to tune of Puff Daddy singing every breath I take.  You have radar that either beep loud making you do turd in robes or sound like LP at end of tracks.  You have torch that has very little power.  Maybe batteries made in Islamabad.  Bad lighting add to atmosphere because it is very dark and everything you kill is very black.  Keep throwing flares like you just don't care.  I find that everything you try to kill get in your face.  This is very bad because headshot means Puff Daddy is spewing in your face.After changing robe you can play sneaky â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ predator campaign.  Sound track change to Ja-la-la-bad... Ja-la-la-bad... I'm gonna make you sweat.  Campaign much easier on heart as you only need to sneak around map.  I found that you can run past Puff Daddy no problem.  You have invisible skin ability and many gadgets like Predator 2 film.Once you are done running around crazy but no one even know it, it will be time to try alien campaign.  In this campaign you crawl over ceilings and walls trying to whip marine in â¥â¥â¥â¥ before they see you.  Most of the time I am visiting toilet with motion sickness like riding camel over many dune.Each campaign not very long, and maps repeated for each campaign.  This is only downside.  Campaign atmosphere very good for all three.  Very worth trying.  I do not know why metacritic reviews very bad.  Game play nice and look nice.Multiplayer also good experience but need to find match first.  Try changing search options to dedicated servers in player matches.  I always find game that way.  Ranked match or using default player hosted matchings do not work for me, my affendi.Multiplayer is predator kill everyone, and alien die to everyone.  Marine okay but not best.  All three character type take time to master and very different to each other.Multiplayer also have game mode where marine team kill many wave of alien.  This game mode also fun for while but get boring after some wave.  Some map open more with more wave but still boring after while.			"

												In my honest opinion 8.5/10Singleplayer 9/10Multiplayer 7.2/10Soundtrack: 9.5/10Horror/Fear: 7.9/10Graphics: 10/10 (From it's release date standpoint)Overall gameplay: 8.7/10The singleplayer is extremely fun; for all three campaigns. No real cons there. Good stories on them all, even if two are left unsaid.However the multiplayer feels a bit rushed; The predator is easily overpowered givne the high attack speed of their melee, strong heavy attack, at ability to easily run from a fight. Not to say the obvious; but the Plasma a Predator can use is extremely overpowered (One-Shot kill on a non-charged shot)Playing as the Alien (Xenomorph) is easily the most fun part of this game; the ability to run, jump and climb on any surface at high speeds is a very unique experience (And fun.)Playing as a Human is aimed more at fast-reaction FPS gamers, forced dim lighting; fairly limited ammunition, and sprinting too long will easily ruin your fun.Playing as the Predator is essentially playing as a walking tank; Slow-moving, extremely tall, armed with dual blades that will tear you a new one, and a health bar to support a mini-boss battle from Dark Souls. Not to make it sound overpowered; they are easily killed if snuck up on or ambushed.			"

												Aliens vs. Predator is a 1st person shooter that continues the tradition of the earlier Alein vs. Predator games. There are three campaigns, each starring a unique character. You can play as a Human Marine, Predator or Alien, and each character has their storyline and playstyle.Having recently played some of Alien vs. Predator 2000, I knew a little of what to expect. What I was hoping for was a modernization of that game, because I found that while it may have been a worthy title in its time, it did not really stand up to the test of time in my opinion.  That is an issue with early 3D games and FPSs in general. This game delivered on that, and more so.The first improvement to address is the tutorial. AvP 2010 gives you a short tutorial as an introduction to each character so you can become accustomed to the controls. I found myself quickly mastering the majority of controls, although walking up walls as a Xenomorph was still a bit tricky. Aiming your various weapons is easy enough, and the button placement seems to make sense.The graphics are really fantastic for what is now a 4 year old game. This was a huge improvement from AvP 2000, and shows you just how far games have come in 10 years. Better graphics help add to the atmosphere, which can be downright scary at times as a Marine.The voice acting and sounds are another high point. The beeps on your motion detector mixed with the gutteral sounds of your Alien attackers will begin to fill you with dread. The rave like scene of an early set piece really uses music well to add to the intensity.With 3 campaigns, there is a lot of variety to this game not usually found in FPS games. I found that the Marine campaign played much like a Survival Horror FPS, the Alien campaign like a Stealth shooter, and the Predator campaign like an overpowered mixture of both. It really is quite an accomplishment that they could pull all of this off in one game. Being able to switch easily between campaigns after missions is a nice touch.One thing to keep in mind is that Aliens vs. Predator is a licensed game. A lot of your enjoyment will be derived directly from that universe. If you enjoy that license, I can whole heartedly recommend AvP. It's an enjoyable FPS on its own accord, and you will love being able to play as all three species. If you are not a fan of Aliens and Predator, I'd still say this is worth a try. The concept is pretty unique, and the gameplay as the Alien is some of the most enjoyable I've experienced. You will, however, probably find that the story does not do much for you since it requires a bit of knowledge from the movies to fully enjoy.Grade: B "

												The amazing AVP3.  One of the best multiplayers in the last decade, [these days you have to search for player internet only hosted servers].  I was initially disappointed with some of the level design especially the trees on the swap levels.  I was never in love with the single player campaign and though it was strange that you couldnt be the predator or that there were no predator  waves on the survival mode.  IMHO alien colonial marine has more advanced graphics and single player.  But AVP3 is all about the multiplayer, with art inspired by famous AVP comics.			"

												Although inferior to 2001âs âAliens vs. Predator 2â and its expansion, this is a fun game.The biggest difference from the other AvP games is that the Predatorâs gameplay now has a higher focus on melee combat, with light attack, heavy attack and block.			"

												Personally, I got this because I really liked playing as the xenos in an earlier incarnation. I haven't tried the multiplayer because the multiplayer scene seems to be dead. The single player aliens missions are satisfying and fun, but unfortunately there's only a couple of hour's worth of gameplay for each faction. If the game is cheap, or if you're super into it, you'll probably have some fun, but don't expect much replayability.			"

												When I recommend this game its with gritted teeth and a flinching demeanor about me. Though it is a fun to play FPS set within the Aliens & Predator universe, it ultimatley isnt anything overly special.Play as either Human, Alien or Predator across three two hour campaigns all of which weave in and out of each other quite nicely. A lot of action and reasonably good FPS gameplay, its certainly better than Aliens: Colonial Marines.			"

												Aliens Coloniel Marines should have used this game as a touch stone for the level of graphical quality from the very very beginning of it's development. This game shouldn't be confused with the formerly mentioned title, as the attention to details and the level of replayability as any of the 3 main races of the aliens universe is nigh impeccable and does the series a fair amount of justice as far as quality of gameplay goes. The story all around isn't this games -strongest- point, sticking to some of the most heavy tread story cliches of the entertainment industry, but it still stands on it's own legs, supported by Lance Henrickson's support of the titles as Mr Weyland himself. This is definitely a game I'd reccomend. I wish they would do away with the rubbish lobby-multiplayer in a belated patch and replace it with a more traditional PC  multiplayer where one can join/leave a dedicated host or server at will without the wait to find a group or squad. Which goes two fold with a couple -bigger- maps for survival modes.. It's 4 years old but it still graphically holds it's own to modern titles... an update or infusion into this older title could help bring some faith back to the disappointed fans who like myself, despised the insult that is Aliens: Coloniel Marines.I give this game a 8/10 overall. Definitely worth a play through or two on each of the campaigns.			"

												I liked Aliens movie from all in Alien universe, so no wonder I like this game (and previous as well). I played only single player campaign. It's a bit short. You can say that same events You see with eyes of all three parties involved. Graphics is still ok, but gameplay is awesome. You will never forget the feel when You hear aliens coming and You don't see them and try to secure Your position (or when You see/hear on Your move detector that somethings is coming) or when Predaor is hunting You. Gameplay changes when You play hunter side. Generally You need to have diffrent approach when You play each side.			"

												Amazing game, which was established in 2010. The story itself, graphics - everything is great. I'm a fan of the game series. And the creators of this game is very tried.Multiplayer:In multiplayer, there are a lot of bugs that need to be corrected, but the developers do not even think about it. The multiplayer is still very cool, fun to play. But newcomers will be very difficult to play on multiplayer servers, as they will be playing against very experienced players. For me, when I went the first time in multiplayer, it was very difficult. But when I played more and more, I learned to play normally.Outcome: Aliens vs Predator - a terrific game, with graphics, storyline. My rating - 10/10			"

												A well done action FPS game that seemed to slip through without being noticed by most people. Play as all 3 species, each with thier own story and goals. GameplayThe gameplay feels fluent and smooth. FPS drops were very few and far between on my medium end PC on high settings. You spend most of your time traversing through mostly linear levels completing objects along the way. In some areas objectives make you kill waves of enemies or solve puzzling problems such as figuring out how to enter a room, which helps keep that game a little more interesting rather than traveling through from place to place shooting everything in site. Where controls are concerned, each species plays differently with thier own style of movement and controls and some are better than others. Playing as the marines feels like your typical FPS game, basically shoot your way through the level with a variety of guns. You feel more vulnerable as a marine as well as Aliens are very quick and come in hordes, and predators are much more powerful. Playing as the Alien and Predator is where this game stands out from other FPS games. The predator has a variety of gadgets such as the laser cannon to fight from a distance as well as a spear and claws to tear your enemies to shreds up close. You are able to jump high and far using an ability, this allows the predators to have alot of verticality to combat. You can also go invisible to catch your enemies by surprise, however get to close and the humans with see through you camo. The Aliens are very quick and agile, while playing the Alien you are able to crawl up walls and leave very far. These contols are hard to get the hang of at first but once you get the hang of them you feel pretty deadly. You are quieter but all these perks come with a price, and that is your health. As the alien you will need to learn to be stealthy on your approach to clear rooms as well as know when to run and hide. Both of these species have special instant kill stealth moves and grab kills, however for as cool as they look, they also leave you very vulnerable to attack, their is also no way of cancelling this action and they take a few seconds to finish. If you are attacked during thease few seconds you will most likely die or barely get away.GraphicsOn high the graphics looked really good, they felt like real areas and fit the setting of the Alien/Predator universe. The levels are pretty well designed, and their is a variety of settings to traverse through as you go through the story such as the forest, ruins, structures and a few others. The gun fire flash looks good in dark rooms and the lighting is done very well adding to the spooky theme of some areas. The design and animation of the Aliens and Predators look well designed and look like their movie counterparts. The animation looks good, especially the Alien looks like it had a lot of work done to it to make it look and move realistically as it crawls over the walls. The animations during the stealth/grab kills are very well done and look badass and gory the way they should be in this style of game. AudioThe audio is decent, although some of the guns sounded terrible and wimpy. The sound design during the levels does a pretty good job of making you feel on edge and adds a little bit to the suspense. The aliens sounded like the aliens from the movies however nothing special, same with the predator, you hear his significant and unique sounds but its nothing really special or new. The marines are terribly voice acted and their likes sounds cheasy. For the most part the audio is decent and will add to the feel of the setting but nothing special.StoryThe story are different and each species has their own goal in mind however their is crossover between each story. As a marine you are trying to fight back the Aliens and find out what happened after a problem occurs in a research facility your goal is to find out what happened, where they are coming from, and how to stop it, but end up crossing paths with the predator down the line changing some of your objectives. The Alien story line has you playing an Alien captured by humans and tested on. When the queen calls you seek to find her, only to be restrained by the humans, however after an issue arises during an experiment you are able to break the shackles that bind you down, allowing you to fight back, escape, and find your queen to learn why she is calling you.The Predator story arc has you playing as a predator needing to prove himself to the elders to earn his right to be a hunter. This has you traveling through multipul areas killing Aliens in trials from the elders, through your trials you will cross paths with the marines leading for some objectives to become skewed as you destroy the resistance.SummaryAliens vs. Predator is a decent FPS action game that goes off the path from your basic FPS game. Being able to play as all 3 species with thier own unique abilities, movements and story arcs is fun and helps the game feel fresh. The story is decent, with some being better than others. They did a good job of balancing the characters out with thier own advantages and weaknesses making each species feel like it should. The world looks good and well designed. The controls feel good and tight, the only one that took a while to get used to was the aliens movements because of its quick pace and ability to climb on walls and other surfaces.This is a good game that would be good to get on sale. Fans of first person shooters may enjoy the originality of playing as all 3 characters in this game, however if you are looking for a horror game, this may not be it. While it seems to try to be one, it doesnt seem to commit to the idea as the game progresses, at most this game may hit the creepy feeling at some points but thats about it.I can not comment on the multiplayer as I never tried it myself, but for the most part from what I've heard is that its fun but almost always dead. So maybe with a few friends it could be fun for a get together.			"

												Not much to say other than; ""I dare thee to play as a Marine either in singleplayer or in multiplayer without nearly defecating in your comfortable looking trousers after the first two minites into the game."" Other than that whip out either the Predator or the Alien and let the funtimes roll in sinister DX11 high definition. Also it should be cheap enough by now, and graphically the game still looks great; so turn your motion tracker to full volume to let the all the Aliens know where you are, get your buddies to shout at you with confused and terrified chatter and make sure the pulse rifle is unslung ready to blast away wildly at your own shadow.

NEVER, has I played a game where, after playing for 10-15 minutes, moving up and down the walls as an Alien is JUST as easy and normal than moving around as gravity accepts it.Multiplayer: Blink - For a second and you will have 4 meters of tail piercing your body, blink for two and you will have your spine pulled from your body by a Predator.Nothing feels better than giving the final blow to your prey, in this immersive game, full of potential.Sadly the lack of players make this game a sad thing to play in multiplayer.

												Iâm not sure whether this game is honestly enjoyable or if my expectations going into it were were so low that I was able to enjoy it. The story is based around 3 campaigns(that may or may not be interlocking, some parts seem that way while others donât), one for each race and each with their own separate playstyles. The human campaign started out really creepy, like something taken straight out of Alien, but then quickly became a really fun shooter but whoever decided to add a thump sound to the radar is dumb.  The alien campaign was the least enjoyable of the 3, in theory it should have been really fun because it has you climbing up walls and running on the roof but it is really disorienting. The predator campaign was also enjoyable but the stealth elements were pretty much useless so good thing the melee combat was enjoyable. It flirts with outstaying its welcome and it is almost too tedious but it ends at a good point and itâs not too dragged out. Overall I feel like this was a fun game, nothing amazing or anything but enjoyable.			"

												This is one of he few games that can blend different characters, storylines, amd actions, to a t. You basically have three different games and storylines. The alien is pure stealth and speed, the marine relys on gadgets and guns, and the predator relys on techinal and stealthy assaults. Each character has a set of view modes (Pred - Heat vision, Marine - Nightvision), and a set of movement modes. The bosses are a bit easy, but definatly some challenging gameplay at some points.  I dont have a specifically high end computer, but the game looks and runs beautifully. Like night and day compared with console versions, which I also owned, and also returned the day after it came out. It just was very buggy and grainy on my ps3. Im glad I bought this for 4 $ on steam sale, or I would have went through my entire life thinking this game was trash. On pc though, this game can bring some pretty incredible gameplay experiences. If your looking for a cheap game, that lets you kil!!!!!! I recommend!			"

												Amazing game! Though, I reccomend a realy strong computer/laptop if you want to play this without any major FPS issues. 8/10. I have a crappy computer, if I had a better computer I would definitly give this game a 9.5/10 its dropped the .5 because its hard to control the alien and is weird to properly play the Alien campaign without raging every few minutes for going up a wall when you didint even aim at it or hold the button, and the game can be so disorienting.

												Single player isn't too long but is enjoyable enough to give a whirl, covering the 3 races well. Covers a decent range for difficulty too, Nighmare is always a challenge.Main reason for purchasing this game would be for the multiplayer. If you can look past the vanilla game having few maps, Survivor mode and PvP with friends is extremely enjoyable.For a franchise game, I rate this highly.Good enough for me to own on Xbox and PC anyway.

												This is a very strategic fps, if youhave a premade team with friends to play it, it will be very fun, the 3 spieces it has have a different way of playstyle and cooperation on multiplayer and the campaign of each is challenging on the max difficulty but sadly it cant be played as coop-campaign, it would be epic to play a campaign of 2 players. In general i dislike shooter games but this one i play it and enjoyed it truly and doesnt make me bored at all as oher fps do as its just shoot run shoot and so on. I highly recommend it. If this was at warhammer universe it would have been Kroot Vs Tyranid among guardsmen bastions LOOOOOOOOOL XD			"

												For a FPS, this game is actually quite long. It takes an average 14 to 17 hours of gameplay to finish it as you play through 3 different types of entities. The enemy AI is really great and sometimes even challenging in certains parts of the game even in normal difficulty. You can play in which ever order and each one gives you a slightly different experience.As the Marnie, the game takes the traditional route like any FPS with you typical arsenal of weapons but with a survival horror twist. When playing, you really got to be on your toes and stay alert as the xenomorphs can pop out of nowhere.As the Alien, the game shifts to a 1st person stealth game as you lurk through vents and pick off the enemy one by one. Stealth is the key and the darkness is your friend. To regain health as the Alien, you must devour your prey. Playing the Alien is my personal favorite.As the Predator, the game is a mix of stealth and the ability to use your wide varity of gadgets with a touch of brute strenght. The predator is the more powerful of the 3, but however don't get too cocky. Predators can be killed too. To regain health for the Predator, he uses a gadget in his arsenal with also drains power. Just remember, electric weapons such as the blaster and should cannon use power.The game's story is not as great as the previous two Aliens vs Predator games and at times can be murky but it makes up for it in the gameplay. If you are a Aliens vs Predator fan, you will not be disappointed as it stays true to the Aliens vs Predator lure. I rate this a 8/10.If you know know nothing about Aliens vs Predator than this game could look average to the casual FPS gamer and may come on as a 6/10.			"

												Action-packed Alien vs Predator game. Three solo campaigns (Marine, Alien and Predator) cover three sides of more or less the same story but with different athmospheres and gameplay which is pretty interesting. However I'd recommend getting this game on a sale price because the current price is a tad too much for the game as a single player experience. It won't last long and is very linear, there are collectibles but they don't add a lot of replay value. The problem is : the multiplayer mode is just like space, ""Online, no one can hear you scream."" That's because the MP mode is a desert.Anyway, without taking MP (ergo, SP only) in consideration I'd rate this game 70/100			"

												Aliens vs Predator is a great game based on the Unreal Engine 3 focused on 3 main parts, 2 of them are 2 different types of stealth action and 1 survival horror (the marines, aliens and predators respectively). The game is always in the first person view, making it highly realistic but a bit confusing when running on walls and it takes some getting used to.The sounds are highly emersive and very realistic, adding to the atmosphere of the game.The graphics are very good (as already mentioned the game is based on the unreal engine 3 , so there isn't really a way to could look bad anyway ), naturally I found one or two places where the textures glitch out but those are random spots on the terrain where the majority of players wouldn't probably visit.The gameplay is solid, the Marines campaign gets a bit tiring since it's pretty much a lot of the same. The aliens campaign is the best however the shortest, (you can't have your cake and eat it too) the predators campaign however kind of doesn't fit in... What I mean by that is that the entire battle between the aliens and humans doesn't really leave much space for the the predators story to develop, but then again I'm just nit-picking at a really solid title.

												This game is a hell of a lot of fun, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  You just have to make peace with its flaws.Like in previous AvP games, the campaign is split into three parallel mini-campaigns, which intertwine in a fun and interesting way, allowing each species to use common elements of the setting's colonies and ruins in different ways for different purposes, and to different ends.  This may end up dissapointing some who will see the campaign as lazily reusing map assets so they don't have to tailor make levels for each character, but I find this complaint falls flat.  The level design smartly builds a unique playing space for each of the game's three species in each game level, something which must have taken much deliberation and iteration, whether or not you agree with the design decision.  Each storyline is really successful in acheiving a different feel and imparting a unique importance to each character;  The marine campaign is a terrifying account of a human just trying to stumble his way through this whole mess alive, the Predator campaign is full of bravado, badassitude, and honor, and the Alien campaign is all about essentially trolling the other two species in a deadly way and undermining everything anyone else is trying to acheive.  Of the three, the Alien's campaign is easily the weakest, although there is still a lot of fun to be had terrifying marines and pinning scientists to the ground for facehugger implantation.The campaigns themselves are surpisingly challenging, though short.  I found that the difficulty of the singleplayer game is mostly fair, harshly punishing stupid mistakes, though your mileage may vary.  A huge part of the game is a keen awareness of your own limitations as a human, Alien, or Predator, and also a smart but controlled exploitation of your own advantages, leading to an experience that can get surpisingly cerebral for what otherwise presents itself as a big, dumb action game (and the story IS big and dumb). The checkpoint system in single player is bizarre and terrible, unfortunately.  This meshes incredibly poorly with how difficult the game can get, leading to moments I just wanted to give up and walk away from the entire game. Ultimately, on the single player side of things, expect a dissapointingly short, dumbly written, but absolutely exciting and relatively unique (at least, in this day and age) romp through the built up mythos of all three species.Multiplayer, unfortunately, is a bit of a mixed bag.  At the best of times, Alien vs Predator's multiplayer is just huge loads of fun.  It's action packed one moment, tensely silent another, and totally empowering the next, just before you realize you're outgunnned or outnumbered and you start running away from other players in terror.  Unfortunately, people's complaints about rampant stupid garbage in multiplayer are SPOT ON ACCURATE.  The different deathmatch modes highlight this game's unfun nonsense way more often than other, more mechanically interesting and unique game modes; unfortunately, TDM is far and away the most popular game mode, drawing in players for its simplicity and action.  Be prepared to scream impotently at your computer as you, a slavering, 7 foot horror from outer space leap at a hapless marine from across the room, only to bounce off and land stunned on the ground as if the guy were made out of steel and bolted to the floor, simply because he saw you or heard you and blocked.  Prepare to occasionally see marines beating predators and aliens in melee combat.  Prepare for plasmacasters still being rage inducing, even 13 years after AvP2.  Prepare, even, for a stealth kill mechanic that encourages players to just run circles around each other to see who can get enough of a glimpse of another player's back to hit the ""E"" key and get an easy instakill.  At this point in the game's life,  players are obliged to play by their own made up rules about when it's okay to get an ""E kill"" or when weapons like the plasmacaster are permitted.The matchmaking, additionally, is absolutely terrible (although there is a server browser), and at this point in time there are very few players, making it a chore to find a game running, let alone a game running something more interesting than Team Death Match.That all being said, when you can get a good game going, the game is really good.  Even through multiplayer's bull, fun shines through.  The Hunt mode from AvP2 returns as Predator Hunt, featuring one Predator vs a team of marines, and is excellent and very evocative of the movies.  The Infestation mode is somewhat similar in set up; the entire team starts as marines, and one of them is chosen randomly to spawn as an alien.  When the alien kills a marine player, the killed player switches sides and joind the aliens, and this continues until the dwindling human group survives for long enough or is wiped out.  Aliens vs Predator also features its own co-op horde mode, Survivor, where marine players take on waves of alien bots. While tense and fun in its own right, Survivor is a bit too light on features compared to the horde modes of other games to really hold my attention.  These sit alongside the game's own point capture mode and three different rulesets for Deathmatch, adding up to a fairly large catalog of different ways to play.All in all, Aliens vs Predator got an unfair shake, I think.  Huge hype combined with mixed reviews to convince the public that the game was a middling cash in, when in actual fact I think that the developers put a lot of thought and heart into bringing back the mechanics of an old multiplayer classic while still trying to innovate.  A lot of the moves they made in production are clear missteps and there's no hiding that, but if you can accept or work past the game's obvous problems, there's quality fun to be had here, and the game certainly offers an experience that simply can't be had anywhere else.It's certainly more fun than Aliens: Colonial Marines, and manages to feel more authentic even with how much effort A:CM's team put into recreating environments and elements from the Aliens film.  I just wish AvP's Survivor mode was more like A:CM's Bug Hunt.			"

												TIME TO COMPLETE: 12 hoursUnfortunately the game doesn't live up to its name and is only a castrated version of the franchise when compared to its predecesors.The campaigns themselves are very short with no more than 3-4 hours with each species. You'd think they'd make up in quality then but unfortunately that is not the case. Like I said the story is a very dumbed-down copy-pasted scenario fans of the extended universe will be familiar with and none of the characters could manage to be likable with all their generic traits the developers inherited them with. Not even the Marine protagonist could stand up as something more than an empty shell of a badass, black dude. The Predator has subtitles but not even those could help. It's quite laughable when you compare it to the silent descriptions of the two alien species from AvP2.Gameplay-wise it has been dumbed down a lot to accomodate for the consoles (and lazy programming, perhaps) with clunky controls and the inability of crouching - not that you would need it but it also shows how mediocre the level design is. My guess is that they had tried to modulate the gameplay but ultimately failed as it's either trophy kills which leave you vulnerable or good ol' stabbing which is not much good either. There's a decent story to go along with but not enough to hide the fact that it's a repetitive ""start the generator"", ""enter lift for exposition"" or ""protect thing"" sequence all over again. The campaigns are short so you might not see it at first but it truly becomes obvious when you move on to the next. The boss fights are not too intimidating either as the joke of ""when in doubt, shoot"" can be applied here.On a positive note the soundtrack is great and it fits quite well, adding some sense of drama or tension to certain moments. Too bad the rest of the story doesn't hold up to it.Overall it's an ok game if you enjoy the newer, dumbed down kind of FPS games but little dedication is seen to have been put into it. I never felt as if it were made by people who were genuinely interested rather than those who wanted to fully profit from it. Get it on sale if you are dying for more AvP stuff but don't expect much as it doesn't live up to what its predecessors have managed to deliver.			"

												Such a strange game, but truly a memory to remain. Offering a great approach to asymmetrical gameplay, AvP allows what few games will ever dare : True choice. Want to run and gun, CoD style? Humans for days.Got that freaky side that loves to tease your friends? Aliens â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ 'ery body out there.Are you the killjoy that your friends murmur about with sharp disgust? Yeah, Predator's know that feel. They got you.All in all, a diverse experience. Even if you don't care for multiplayer, then you still have the THREE campaigns to play. Each incredibly different, you'll get to enjoy your pick of a horror, action, or even a stealth-focused campaign. As a biased player, I still must beg you, my unfortunate reader, to truly consider the human campaign. It's like the Michael Bay's version of Alien: Isolation. You need this in your life. 9/10, would get dismembered/anally probed again. "

												Bought it on sale for 4 bucks. This game is great and very fun. 3 campaignsMarine, Xenomorph, and PredatorPros: Fun and challenging story (especially on Nightmare difficulty. No checkpoints)Each campaign has a unique play style. Marine is surviving from xeno attacks, Alien's and Prdeator's have a stealthy feelMultiplayer is very fun, especially with friendsCons:The campaigns are fairly short. About 5-6 missions each classYou'll occasionally find that one casul in multiplayer that's a hacker teleporting around the mapSome game modes are harder to find a match for than others8.5/10 "

												As a fan of the Alien franchise as well as the Predator, I personally think this is a great game. This game puts you in the eyes of your favorite species: Xenomorph, Predator, and Colonial Marine, all with unique characteristics and abilites. Xenomorphs can traverse on walls  and sneak up on enemies only to tear their head off. Predators can go invisible for a short time and have thermal optics to better see enemies, slashing them to bits. And Marines, well.. they have guns. Being able to play as all 3 species puts a whole twist on the franchise, and allows people to finally realize what it feels like to be a bloodthirsty Predator. While this game is old, it is still a classic. My one and only complaint is that the campaign is rather short for all the species. You basically play for awhile completeling various objectives, fight a boss, then switch species. It can be over quick, but still very enjoyable. If you enjoy the movies, you'll love the game.			"

												This game is amazing! All the unique factions, weapons, skins, and gamemodes make this game an awesome fps!Single Player: The single player is a basic campaign mode. There are three different campaigns, each about 3 hours long. You can play the Alien campaign, Marine campaign, and Predator campaign. It's cool how all these stories are connected but with different perspectives.Multiplayer: The multiplayer is a standard fps online multiplayer. You can play as the 3 different factions, play all sorts of unique gamemodes, and level up to unlock skins for your factions. As a marine, you use guns and grenades to eliminate your enemies. The guns are a pulse rifle, pistol, shotgun, sniper rifle, flamethrower, smart gun, and rocket launcher. Playing as a marine is a basic fps basically. The Alien faction is a speedy faction which can climb up walls, go in vents, and do parkour. They use their tails, claws, and stealth takedowns to elimenate enemies. The Predator faction uses all sorts of weapons and gadgets. Spears, missile launchers, and razor blades. Predators can also cloak and use heat vision. It is pretty easy to find a server, and a decent amount of people play.Gameplay & Modes: The game is basically an fps. The factions are balanced with unique skills and skins. In the campaign, there are many stealth missions which you have to use stealth and takedowns to eliminate enemies. The modes are species TDM, TDM, DM, and Domination.Skins & Leveling Up: As you play AVP multiplayer, you will rank up depending on how good you do in a match. You gain xp by getting kills and doing awesome stuff, and the ranking system is basically just COD's ranking system. As you level up, you will unlock skins to make your characters look awesome. The max rank is 99. 10/10 "

												Most feel the game was a disappointment, when in fact to me I felt it was a great addition to the AVP family of games. Though many of the older ones the one that started this one avp 2000 classic isn't used much & the AVP 2 which servers for it are no longer around except a few die hard groups for example ARC who still have it going. Point of this is I feel this game is a master work of a game. I can only hope it stay going strong for many years to come.			"

												First, while I admit this game isn't as close to being as good as the one developed in 2001 (AVP 2), it does have some perks, but I'd give this game a 7/10 for effort.Perks:1)  Great atmosphere, you will get some level of fear playing as the marine (which is where the main story is)2)  Predator and Alien campaigns are pretty well done, while adding depth to the species3)  Enjoy the limiting of the marine's weapons, requiring you to make valid and calculated choices.4)  Lance Henrickson . . . enough said5)  Fighting off an alien hive in an adult bar . . . epic and scary at the same time.5)  Being able to attack the Preds with a cohort of Xenomorphs.Flaws:1)  The melee combat for humans?  WTF is a pistol whip going to do against a Xeno or Pred about to shaft you?2)  Predalien that can hop through lava?  Come on, downing the queen early on was more plausible, as was the Praetorian.3)  Voice-less main character?  In this age of story-telling, having a silent protagonist is kinda lackluster to the product.4)  Doesn't seem to be enough fear and suspense in some areas for a game based on two classics of the same genre.So, while I give the game props for decent level design and graphics, along with some interesting play options . . . it's kinda lackluster for the series compared to the two originals.  I recommend this game to those who truly love the series or like the potential in the multiplayer . . . other than than, it's kind of a meh level thumbs up.			"

Movies and games,the predator is like the ultimate hunter. He is very powerful, when taking down marines this can require patience if there are mutiple of them. The predators advantages consist of his health, his weapons, and his claw speed. For his health he has the most health in the game. Him being the biggest one of the three this is not suprising. His weapons are godly poweful. He has four weapons. The campaign starts you with them in this order. Plasma caster, Mines, Smart disc, and Spear.  The plasma caster is a very powerful weapon. If you charge it long enough if it hits it is an automaic one hit. The plasma caster automatically predicts where youre target is going to go and fires there. The proximity mines are essentialey plasma clamores that detect in all directions. This is most effective against marines as they arent fast enough to escape one if they set it off. The smart disc, my favorite weapon, Is a edged disc that is guided by the laser on your mask when you throw it. It can bounce off of walls an absured amount of times and make the enemy â¥â¥â¥â¥ their pants. If it hits the body it leaves any species with one light melee attack left in them. On hitting the head the target will instantly die. This works against predators often as their head is pretty big. Now finally for the spear. I feel like this one would have made first if it werent for my love of the disc. The spear is a skillshot weapon that can miss often. If it does hit it is a guaranteed kill. That is it for the predator other than the fact that it is harder to knock him down and while his light atack is slower than the aliens his heavy attack is much faster. ALIEN: The alien is a more aggressive charcter in general. The alien has only its melee, to make up for this it has the most mobility in the entire game. It can climb on any surface. Its heavy attack is an insant if they are on the wall. It wont do full heavy attack damage if you dont hit them in the head. If you do manage to hit them in the head they are pretty much screwed. As it stuns and does alot of damage. A second tail will usually kill them. The alien can be very prone to dieing if they fight up too close to their target and make their approach obvious. The alien has the second most health in the game. In melee combat what they have superior to the predator is their light attack is much faster. Their heavy attack although slower stuns longer. Their finishing moves AKA grabs are usually faster. This can be an upside or a down-side depending on how you look at it, but the alien automatically regenerates health.MARINE: The marine is sterotyped as the worst character in the game. He is not. The reason his seems to be is he is very difficult although when mastered is a hell hole to deal with. The marine has the lowest health and mobility. The marine fights with guns.GUNS: Pistol: It is his weakest weapon although it has unlimited ammo.Pulse rifle: It is his auto-matic assult rifle. It is the all around weapon. It has alot of ammo its mag size being 99. Jesus. PS You also get to start with this is multiplayer when you spawn. Its secondary fire is a grenade. AKA Noob toob for cod players.Shotgun: If you have enemies that like to pounce at you instead of blocking try to hit them with this last second. The shotgun is a very up-close weapon its secondary fire is a buckshot that will stun and instakill if close enough.Sniper: My favorite weapon. If you hit all shots in the body it will three hit. Don't let that fool you into thinking its bad. Its semi automatic so this seems op to some players. The second shot will stun too. If you hit an alien or predator in the head they will be stunned so finish them with one more bullet as headshots will leave them with low enough health to die to this.Smartgun: The marines last but not least weapon. This is like a minigun except with a square on your screen that it has aimbot in. This thing is the bain of predator players. It will detect them while they are invisible. The only downsides to this weapon are having low ammo. Cant run while holding it and it takes up two weapon slots.In my oppinion this is one of the most under-rated games of all time. This game derserves so much love that it doesnt get. The only thing that ruins my fun is hackers which arent too common but you will see one of you play this enough. I want you to try this game. Its not even that expensive. To me if it were 100 dollars I would still get it. I hope you have fun in your journeys of this game! Bye bye!			"

												played this game a long time ago along with AvP 2, and i didnt like it much back then.  played it again now, and i like it more now than back then.+ graphics, the level of detail in the design of the charecters and creatures is AMAZING.+ alien AI, it is simply the best alien AI to date; the way they move, the way they use the enviroment to sneak up on u and dodge ur shots.  i would say the alien AI here is even better than the more recent Alien isolation (ANOTHER FREAKIN AWESOME GAME)+ the predatore campain, the presentation of this particulare campain and how it runs is just great, makes u feel liek the hunter (as it should)+ the predalien+ sound design is fantastic, and the music is scripted nicely to fit the situations- the art style is meh on close inspection, and â¥â¥â¥â¥ that outline thing around the charecters.- predatore AI, the complete opposite of the alien AI, the predator AI is so bad to the point that the predator boss fight in the marin campain is too easy (i didnt get hit once FFS)- the marin campain, the marin story has always been imo the weak link of the games; tying down the alien and predator to the marin story line just limits the other 2 stories that have potential to much better and more supstantial if left un constained by the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ humans.- the controls, this was wat made me hate this game back when it was new, the movement is stiff, the animations r heavily delayed and just...stiff.  everythign about it feels stiff and constraintive, as if this game was tryign to be more scrripted than free.- campain length, i finished the game in 6 hours.- predator weapons, where is the arsenal of weapons the predator had in the previous game? the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ marin has more weapons here than the predator DA â¥â¥â¥.- the repetitve levels, u go thro the same 6? levels on the 3 campaigns and its dull near the end- the 3 story lines dont tie up satisfyingly as in AvP 2, by the end of my second playthrough im still not sure wither the predator campaign happens before, during, or after the marine.  its just confusing and ends up feeling without purpose in the end.over all, i love this game, but still like the previouse one a whole lot better.  and this one is good treatment for the horror stress of alien isolation, high recommend playing that first then playing this to give the aliens some much needed revenge.

												Really awsome game, i am this person that do like having some gore and being the stealth person, this game have most of it. its story is good and fun to playthrough for the xenomorph and the predator while the marine campaign is just, plain boring.the game also looks really nice in graphics standard, multiplayer is kinda dead but if your lucky you will find people to play with.the game aint bad as people claim it to be, playing as the fast xenomorph and standing in the dark and climb on walls and the predator with they high tech arsenal and cloak.if you like the avp franchise then this is a good game for you to pick up.9/10			"

												Although this game doesnt compare to the original AvP1 (Gold Edition) and AvP 2, this game is pretty much fun on its own. You get to play as three of the original species in the AvP universe: the xenomorph, the predator, and the humans. Probably the most fun I've had is playing as the Predator and sneaking up behind human and gutting them.  Shooting aliens is also very fun as the marines too.  The only thing I disliked was the fact that when you climb walls as the Alien you will get a major headache and this game lacks the CROUCH control!! Really... a FPS game that lacks crouching!?!?! Overall, this game is fun if you are a big fan of the AvP universe, the graphics are nice, and the environment is great too.  Sooo are you guys ready to ""GET TO THE CHOPPPPPAAAA!!!!""			"

												This ain't the game of the year, no arguing here but if you enjoy even a little the ideas of hunting, hiding and surviving well it would be a shame not to get your hand on this title. It's definitly not worth 50â¬ but it sure as hell is worth 5â¬. Primary interest of the game being the multiplayer, it just brings in a gamer's life something rather ""fresh"" to have fun with, weither you choose the brutal Predators, the sneaky Aliens or the over armed Humans you've no choice but to be delighted with every kill you grab, literally.The two DLC wich are just map packs are in my opinion just a racket, although the 2 of them at 3â¬ instead of 12â¬ make it well worth it. Get it now or never. See you in game.			"

												By far the best Aliens/Predator game out there. Gear Box and Sega should have taken notes to avoid the mid air plane collision that was Colonal Marines. Pros:-3 paralell story lines following each race, each giving a diffrent play style and expirience.(Marines - survival/horror/shooter, Aliens - stealth/assassin, Predator - Hack n Slash RPG <Serriously)-Faithful representation of the source material-Manages to add new enemies without making it feel shoe horned in. -Marine Mission awesome-Alien Mission awesome-Predator Mission AMAZING!!!Cons: -AI can be dumb at times, Aliens tend to run in circles when on walls when confused.-Marine dialogue can be cliche' (which seems to be a problem with any game that has the Colonial Marines in it)TL/DR: Didn't like Colonial Marines and not interested in Alien Isolation? Get this game.			"

												Very fun game. Granted, it is 5 years old now, it has pretty impressive graphics. Now, I've had this game for a while and never really downloaded it because I expected it to not work on my computer. I recently decided ""I might as well try it"" so I downloaded it, and played it. It ran perfectly. But I'm not here to talk about the Graphics, I'm here to talk about why it's fun.First impressionsWell, first thing I thought of when I loaded the game up was Metroid Prime. Why? Well the Main Menu, as well as the gameplay just kinda reminded me of it. Especially the Predator's playthrough. I still can't shake the Metroid Prime vibe it gives me, but I like it x3Now, onto the campaigns:The PredatorSo. The ultimate bounty hunter (next to Samus Aran of course) in your control. I didn't really know what to expect at first, but I went through the tutorial and was like ""hey this game's pretty neat!"" I liked how the predator could jump to areas (it's a bit weird that it didn't let me sometimes, but then I realized you have to be at a certain distance). The Predator has a variety of weapons at his disposal (who doesn't know that though) and has an interesting playstyle. I kept uncloaking accidently when I mean to use the Predator vision, but that's my own fault xD I eventually stopped the confusion, and managed to play the Predator alright.The MarinesNow this was the second campaign I decided to try out, because I wanted to get a feel of all the playstyles before I go through the entire Predator campaign. This was a drastic change from the Predator, mainly because you can't exactly jump around or use special vision to see your enemies. I didn't mind it though, I actually liked the ""helpess"" feel it kinda gave. It gave a more serious, and spooky, playstyle because you only have a flare and a flashlight to see in the dark, and although you do have a gun, and a radar, you still need to be on your toes. If you want a good ""scare"" (and I mean that lightly, more so creepy if anything), I'd say play as Marines.The AliensYou know the saying ""Last but not least"", or, ""Save the best for last""? Well, I didn't intend to play the Aliens last, but the Predator just caught my eye first. When I played as The Alien, I actually got a very strong ""I'm a pet dog"" feel. I dunno, I found it entertaining to act as if I were the humans' Alien pet. But aside from that, the gameplay of the Alien was AWESOME. I don't know about you, but the mobility of the Alien, and knowing you're a huge threat to humans (and maybe Predators) gives me the biggest boner most excitement when I play as it. Why, you ask? Well, my reason is that the Alien is the coolest freakin' thing in the game (next to the Predator) to play as. I just love being able to climb on walls, hiss whenever I want, and crawl SUPER FREAKIN' FAST, as well as have a huge tail. I love the tail. I can't even explain anymore why I love the Alien so much, it's just my favorite one to play as. He's so fast, and so sneaky. Gotta love it.MultiplayerI know this game is 5 years old, but hey, I decided why not try the multiplayer? I searched for a lobby, and managed to find 2 other people. Yes, the multiplayer is unfortunately very very dead, BUT I do believe that if you get a bunch of friends to play with (which I have yet to do, but I really want to), you'll most likely have a great time.Anywho, I really do recommend this game, and it's actually on sale now for like $3.74, so get it while it's still cheap!! It's worth it, trust me.For any tl;dr peoplePredator
 Predator first playthrough I chose Predator is pretty cool, variety of weps, interesting playstyleMarines
 Gives ""spooky/creepy"" feel Almost helpess, only source of light is flare + Flashlight You have guns, but watch your backAliens
 My favorite playstyle Super freakin' agile/fast/awesome You have a very awesome tail to kill with Being a huge threat (to humans and maybe Predator) feels awesomeMultiplayer
 Ded :c Could potentially be VERY fun with friends Worth it if you have a lot of friends to play withSo yeah. That's my review of Aliens vs. Predator. Try it for yourself, see which playstyle is your favorite. :)			"

												The game is perfect for fans of the alien and/or predator franchises giving u the option to play as alien, predator or human. There are seperate campains (one for each race) which is good if you don't enjoy playing a certain race. The only draw back is that not enough people play multiplayer and you can end up waiting an hour only to find one person. However over all this game is fun to play so i do recomend it especially if u like the franchise.			"

												This game's three campaigns are really barebones.  They aren't really fun or engaging, but are playable.The multi-player is extremely fun.  One of the most fun I've played, altho the Predators are by far the most capable.  That's why the game uses a balance of 1:2 concerning them in team balancing; but, in the wild frontier of private servers, it's safe to expect a usual team of true predator heroes.			"

												Good game. Just first missions are scary and you can feel frightened only while playing marines. Alien and predator missions are easier i guess. Playing missions of all races makes the game better and better. Graphics are cool, very good for a 2010-released game.If you are a fan of AvP, you gonna love this game.Except of a dead multiplayer that is like desert, the game is good and worth playing.			"

												Multiplayer is still up. Play with friends, make new friends. I've made about 7 friends playing this game, and at the same time I've had countless Game Nights with friends too. We love to just run around, killing each other a multitude of times in a number of gruesome ways. Play predator? Sneak up behind a human player and rip their head off infront of their teammates. Play Alien? Rush the enemy players with your fellow bugs and even as your numbers fall, your blood kills the enemy. Play Human? Prepare to â¥â¥â¥â¥ yourself as you run in a group, making sure to keep one another alive while making sure you survive. The game is great, the storyline for each race is decent, and the multiplayer gamemodes are just wonderful.			"

												An amazing game both for campaign and the multiplayer! Works perfectly with the XBOX controller for windows and I found the controls easy to use. Game runs smoothly, though I recommend for less lag turning down the resolution. I noticed when I was playing the campaign, it would lag a bit and some enemies seemed to teleport by the time I would try to shoot them; I would end up dying because of this. The story for each campaign connects and you get 3 different views on it! I found it to be engaging and fun. An experience you will never forget!As for online, I know many people were worried about not many people playing on the servers, but when I went on there were various servers to choose from. People still play this a lot! Especially since it is on PC. If you are playing the console version, yes, the servers might be dead, but PC? That hardly seems to be a problem.If anything, join groups to find others who frequently play online. Highly recommend if you are looking for an action game with some scares in it! (Marines campaign is the scariest)			"

												This is one of my favourites games I've ever played, very nice graphics and the game it's from 2010. The thing that disappointed me is the campaign from all the 3 species.. The Alien one is short, ended like in almost 2 hours.. and one more thing, the mutliplayer is dead.. it's so sad that the game is not played anymore by some people, at least you can play with friends. I really recommend it, but the campaign is short... all you can do after you beat it is inviting some friends to play multiplayer with you (it's very fun) or search for people to play together.9/10			"

No checkpoints)Each campaign has a unique play style. Marine is surviving from xeno attacks, Alien's and Prdeator's have a stealthy feelMultiplayer is very fun, especially with friendsCons:The campaigns are fairly short. About 5-6 missions each classYou'll occasionally find that one casul in multiplayer that's a hacker teleporting around the mapSome game modes are harder to find a match for than others8.5/10 "

												Incredibly fun game! In fact, this is my second favorite AVP game(The first being AVP2, which unfortunately isn't available on steam) The graphics are incredible and each of the three single player campaigns are quite long, and let's you choose to play as either Alien, Predator or Lunch. In fact, each is like a game in and of it's self! My favorite Campaign is the Alien campaign....it's ALWAYS the alien campaign!In fact, if I were told to find fault in the game I would be very hard pressed! The game is very well polished as far as FPS titles goes. It's very well fleshed out, and I am quite pleased! I guess though I would like to see the game more active in the online area. However I am more interested in the SP aspect of games, the Multiplayer capabilities is just an added bonus(unless it's a co-op mode...i love those).If you love Aliens(or Predator), and love a solid story driven single player experience, then I highly recommend this game! If you are only interested in Multiplayer then you might want to reconsider due to the few people who do play online.			"

												By far the best Aliens/Predator game out there. Gear Box and Sega should have taken notes to avoid the mid air plane collision that was Colonal Marines. Pros:-3 paralell story lines following each race, each giving a diffrent play style and expirience.(Marines - survival/horror/shooter, Aliens - stealth/assassin, Predator - Hack n Slash RPG <Serriously)-Faithful representation of the source material-Manages to add new enemies without making it feel shoe horned in. -Marine Mission awesome-Alien Mission awesome-Predator Mission AMAZING!!!Cons: -AI can be dumb at times, Aliens tend to run in circles when on walls when confused.-Marine dialogue can be cliche' (which seems to be a problem with any game that has the Colonial Marines in it)TL/DR: Didn't like Colonial Marines and not interested in Alien Isolation? Get this game.			"

												Very fun game. Granted, it is 5 years old now, it has pretty impressive graphics. Now, I've had this game for a while and never really downloaded it because I expected it to not work on my computer. I recently decided ""I might as well try it"" so I downloaded it, and played it. It ran perfectly. But I'm not here to talk about the Graphics, I'm here to talk about why it's fun.First impressionsWell, first thing I thought of when I loaded the game up was Metroid Prime. Why? Well the Main Menu, as well as the gameplay just kinda reminded me of it. Especially the Predator's playthrough. I still can't shake the Metroid Prime vibe it gives me, but I like it x3Now, onto the campaigns:The PredatorSo. The ultimate bounty hunter (next to Samus Aran of course) in your control. I didn't really know what to expect at first, but I went through the tutorial and was like ""hey this game's pretty neat!"" I liked how the predator could jump to areas (it's a bit weird that it didn't let me sometimes, but then I realized you have to be at a certain distance). The Predator has a variety of weapons at his disposal (who doesn't know that though) and has an interesting playstyle. I kept uncloaking accidently when I mean to use the Predator vision, but that's my own fault xD I eventually stopped the confusion, and managed to play the Predator alright.The MarinesNow this was the second campaign I decided to try out, because I wanted to get a feel of all the playstyles before I go through the entire Predator campaign. This was a drastic change from the Predator, mainly because you can't exactly jump around or use special vision to see your enemies. I didn't mind it though, I actually liked the ""helpess"" feel it kinda gave. It gave a more serious, and spooky, playstyle because you only have a flare and a flashlight to see in the dark, and although you do have a gun, and a radar, you still need to be on your toes. If you want a good ""scare"" (and I mean that lightly, more so creepy if anything), I'd say play as Marines.The AliensYou know the saying ""Last but not least"", or, ""Save the best for last""? Well, I didn't intend to play the Aliens last, but the Predator just caught my eye first. When I played as The Alien, I actually got a very strong ""I'm a pet dog"" feel. I dunno, I found it entertaining to act as if I were the humans' Alien pet. But aside from that, the gameplay of the Alien was AWESOME. I don't know about you, but the mobility of the Alien, and knowing you're a huge threat to humans (and maybe Predators) gives me the biggest boner most excitement when I play as it. Why, you ask? Well, my reason is that the Alien is the coolest freakin' thing in the game (next to the Predator) to play as. I just love being able to climb on walls, hiss whenever I want, and crawl SUPER FREAKIN' FAST, as well as have a huge tail. I love the tail. I can't even explain anymore why I love the Alien so much, it's just my favorite one to play as. He's so fast, and so sneaky. Gotta love it.MultiplayerI know this game is 5 years old, but hey, I decided why not try the multiplayer? I searched for a lobby, and managed to find 2 other people. Yes, the multiplayer is unfortunately very very dead, BUT I do believe that if you get a bunch of friends to play with (which I have yet to do, but I really want to), you'll most likely have a great time.Anywho, I really do recommend this game, and it's actually on sale now for like $3.74, so get it while it's still cheap!! It's worth it, trust me.For any tl;dr peoplePredator
 Predator first playthrough I chose Predator is pretty cool, variety of weps, interesting playstyleMarines
 Gives ""spooky/creepy"" feel Almost helpess, only source of light is flare + Flashlight You have guns, but watch your backAliens
 My favorite playstyle Super freakin' agile/fast/awesome You have a very awesome tail to kill with Being a huge threat (to humans and maybe Predator) feels awesomeMultiplayer
 Ded :c Could potentially be VERY fun with friends Worth it if you have a lot of friends to play withSo yeah. That's my review of Aliens vs. Predator. Try it for yourself, see which playstyle is your favorite. :)			"

												Definitely worth the purchase, although not completely worth $15, I bought it on sale which I recommend you do too. It's a fun game with lots of blood gore and intense action. The marine campaign mixes the moods of both the original Alien and Aliens films which works perfectly. The Predator campaign is fun and ripping heads off makes your spine tingle. Multiplayer is very active every once in a while, but at other times is a desert. So if you want to play multiplayer all day, you'll only be half satisfied. I recommend this game.			"

												Violence can't buy my love.Aliens vs. Predator  it's a decent game for me, it starts off with an undoubthly good setting presenting itself as a high production Aliens and Predator game that the fans have been waiting for a very long time.However that's only half the reality, the game starts getting boring when you start noticing there's not many more than the wonderful graphics and scenarios, as a matter of fact, the scenarios trascend to all three campaigns as beign the same (this beign marine, alien, and predator) If there's anything good to be said it's that the campaigns tends to have it's moments and keep itself off from trying to be pretencious and overboard it's own expectations.The problem it's that the game it's extremely repetitive, this making it fell off a pattern that doesn't go nowhere rather than just force the player to keep playing through moments that he already been in. Overall it just wasn't a fun or even enjoyable ride, it sure keeps it's moments the executions from the predator and the marine campaign are something definitley worth your time but the little to no worthwhile details don't seem to cut it for me.The price is also excessive, this game should be ten dollars, maybe seven, But fiftheen? For a game like this is just not worth your time, however i like it and this is why im giving it a recommendation. "

												A side from the ""bad"" story in single player, it's a blast in multiplayer. Well if you're not a noob that is. Anyways great combat system, acts like rock paper scissors in a sense. Marines have a long distance advantage, Xenomorphs get the melee advantage, while predators are a combination of the two. Everything balances out in combat, cept the xenomorphs randomly walk on walls during combat. Other than the bad story and difficult controls of the xenomorphs. Great Game! 8.5/10			"

												Bought it on sale for 4 bucks. This game is great and very fun. 3 campaignsMarine, Xenomorph, and PredatorPros: Fun and challenging story (especially on Nightmare difficulty. No checkpoints)Each campaign has a unique play style. Marine is surviving from xeno attacks, Alien's and Prdeator's have a stealthy feelMultiplayer is very fun, especially with friendsCons:The campaigns are fairly short. About 5-6 missions each classYou'll occasionally find that one casul in multiplayer that's a hacker teleporting around the mapSome game modes are harder to find a match for than others8.5/10 "

												This is one of my favourites games I've ever played, very nice graphics and the game it's from 2010. The thing that disappointed me is the campaign from all the 3 species.. The Alien one is short, ended like in almost 2 hours.. and one more thing, the mutliplayer is dead.. it's so sad that the game is not played anymore by some people, at least you can play with friends. I really recommend it, but the campaign is short... all you can do after you beat it is inviting some friends to play multiplayer with you (it's very fun) or search for people to play together.9/10			"

												The DEMO does NOT do this game justice!  This game is very fluid in feel, the plot is simple enough but you know what you're getting with an AVPVM game.

												While AVP doesn't exactly do anything special in a first person shooter it still is a lot of fun. Every faction has it's own unique gameplay style.  The game is a bit more than average and $15 is a pretty reasonable price, but if you can grab it on sale for about $5 it would be a solid buy. The only con is that the multiplayer is practically dead except for about 3 game lobbies. Oh btw if anyone was wondering... PREDATOR CAN KICK ALIEN'S BUTT ANYDAY!

												Aliens vs Predator was a blast with not one but three story modes and a great multiplayer. When playing the alien story mode you get to play as the mighty Xenomorph, bitting and slashing predators and humans in brutal ways. When play the Predator in the predator story mode you to kill aliens and humans with hi-tech equipment like the laser gun and the claw. In the Marine story mode it mainly consist of marines vs aliens and not much of the predators.  For people which like Call of Duty and first person shooters, the marine mode is for you. If you like Adventure games or action games the alien or predator mode will suit you.6/10			"

The gameplay is immersive and you actually feel like you are walking in the shoes/claws of each of the species! Each of the stories intertwine into climactic battles of their own and theres a lot of hidden collectibles!And fyi, the multiplayer is definately NOT DEAD!

Marines have a long distance advantage, Xenomorphs get the melee advantage, while predators are a combination of the two. Everything balances out in combat, cept the xenomorphs randomly walk on walls during combat. Other than the bad story and difficult controls of the xenomorphs. Great Game! 8.5/10			"

												While this latestet iteration of the Alien Vs. Predator franchise is perhaps not nearly so terrifying insofar as playing a human is concerned, it moves fowards in leaps and bounds towards granting players a true feeling of being a predator and being an alien. The abilities, atmosphere and sound effects associated with playing the two non terrestrial races gives a satisfyingly powerful feeling while still requiring careful attention to avoid sudden and immediate death.There is very little to mention beyond the fact that fans of the AvP franchise will be pleasently satisfied by the experience provided here, at least on the surface.The big downside of the game however, is found in it's length and a multiplayer component that is terribly one sided toward predator players who have skill.If you're looking for a lasting and challenging experience within the AvP universe, this probaby isnt it since the only real challenge lies in learning certain encounters, but if you want to indulge the hunter within and claim some trophies, then pick this one up while it's on sale.

												This version of the Aliens vs Predator franchise is definitely the best I've seen so far, though I still haven't tried Alien Isolation, which is the kind of content the Alien franchise should be producing, for both film and game.This game brings you into the alternate universe brought about in the Dark Horse comic book series, that pits the James Cameron's technological Colonial Marines against Ridley Scott and H.R. Giger's Aliens, along with Stan Winston's Predator (character and costume design anyway).Pros:::: Graphics are great, supporting D3D11 features, characters and environments really come to life...::: Sound and foley is emersive::: Story line is well written as well, involving a separate campaign storyline for each species including characters from the movies (Lance Henrikson's Weyland)::: Multiplayer is fun and can be an exceptional experience depending upon which characters you play as::: Multiplayer maps created from the movie locations, including the Nostromo, Fury 161 and Hadley's Hope (the colony on LV-426)::: Separate mouse sensitivity for both the X and Y axis::: Close combat system for those ""close encounters""::: Skirmish (both single and multiplayer) mode that pits a species against an onslaught of the Aliens which can be quite fun::: The menus have a real Weyland-Yutani feel to them and are very well doneCons:::: Multiplayer can be a little bit unbalanced depending upon which species you play::: Some of the situations in the marine campaign can be very challenging comparitively to the other species::: Controls can take some getting used toThe multiplayer activity for this title has died down substantially but is still available so you might need to ""hunt"" for players to hunt in the game.The graphics and environments are very detailed and can be lead to claustrophobia while playing. You'll be looking over your shoulder quite often in this one if you're a marine or predator. If you're the alien, well the ai characters will spend lots of time looking over their shoulders and you can drop onto them from any surface.There's been talk of a new movie that might open up the story line from between Aliens and Alien 3, with Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and Corporal Hicks (Michael Biehn) working together once again to thwart the spread of the Alien species and Weyland-Yutani from their mandate to weaponize the alien creatures.This title falls in part way in the Aliens universe and part way into the Predators universe. If you like the film franchise (either Alien or Predator or the combined Aliens vs Predator) then this is will be enjoyable even if just for the single player campaigns. Good as an FPS whether you are into the movies or not. Very intense if you like feeling panicked and running for your life.			"

												Amazing recreation of a classic game brought back to life with new technology and better resources. The game offers you mult segmented parts where you play between Marine, Alien, and Predator stories. Each segment may or maynot be tied into each other but you can play on as one character through all the way or switch between each character between missions. First person controls are great and all actions and aesthetics are a perfect match to the movies. aliens can cling to ceilings and bleed corrosive blood, Marines have motion detectors and flares to help locate threats, and the Predator has his multi functional mask and futuristic arsenal. Overall its a revamp of a classic that adds depth that newer games offer. The ambiance of a dark hallway can actually become a dark threat and a predator feels powerful but still outgunned. A must have for fans of either series!			"

												This game is fun if you like the franchise, loved the atmosphere in it, comes from both Predator and Aliens franchises. Music is recognizable, i especially love the Predator parts and as an Alien finally going against them hehe. Campaigns are alot shorter than the older AvP games. Multiplayer is good though map size could have been bigger and more variations, there are map pack bundles but they should be cheaper, and it was one of the reasons many didnt buy the mappacks although myself had bought them just to see and theyre better but no other people seems havent bought because i never seen anyone play them online.Overall good AvP flick with great potential. Hope next AvP will atleast be better than this.			"

												AI is very interesting in this game, they don't react as a normal person would, when finding a dead body, they only look at it and then go back looking for you, they aren't frightened that one of their friends just got pierced with a tail through their head, rather than ""damnit, the black guy died!"" it would appear they said. but despite that i must say, this game was very fun, i enjoyed lurking in the shadows as an alien, sneaking in the trees as a predator, and crying of fear in a corner as a colonial marine. BUT; if you are looking for a game to experience the alien race and it's ways of killing things you might not want to buy this particular game though they haven't worked too much with the alien campaign and lore in this game, i would rather suggest you buy Alien vs. predator 2 though it is way more hard to find it will be a much better experience not only as an alien but all the other races too.

												First off, the game is amazing, i would hope that another game like this would be made again or at least remaster this one. The game tells the story of three species on an alien plane: The Humans, The Aliens, and The Predators. This game was perfecty mixed with elements of action, strategy, and stealth. It requires you to play differently for every species. For humans, it requires you to stay alive using nothing but a recon, flash light, and what ever traces of ammo scatered around the world. As Aliens, it requires you to use stealth and carefuly plan your attacks to get passed motion detectors and a large amount of guards and Predators. And as the Predators, it requires you to kill the humans and rid them of your planet while trying to fight away hoardes of Alien swarms. This game is great and has an amazing story that arches into each different species. The only bad thing is the online community is dead. So, i recommend you and a friend get the game in order to play online.			"

												AVP (2010) has nice graphics, good sound design, solid atmosphere, and an interwoven story for Human, Xenomorph and Predator species spread across three campaigns.  The campaigns can all be beaten in about 10-15 hours of play total - give or take some hours based on your proficiency and desire for achievement hunting.  And it has difficulty settings, xp for rankings, and blah blah blah...  The story isn't bad, but it really only serves as an excuse to move you through each of the rather linear mission areas.  Every species receives communication from a leader that sends them from objective to objective until the mission area is complete and you can move onto the next one.  The story environs allow you to experience the inside of a hive, a colony base, and an ancient Predator pyramid amongst ruins in a tropical jungle.  You'll encounter several variations of Xenomorphs,  Predators, and Androids - SPOILER:  They all want to kill you.As each of the species have different abilities - the playstyle for each is completely different.  Xenomorphs can climb on almost all surfaces, leap at enemies (also vents), claw at enemies, whip them with their tail, and bite into their heads.  They can also ""harvest"" enemies by grabbing them and allowing a facehugger to attach.  Xenomorphs specialize in stealth and speed and to that end they can hide in vents, crawl through tight spaces, destroy lights which helps them hide in the dark, and hiss to lure enemies to their (tasty) demise.  Xenomorphs can see fine in the dark and they can see the auras of enemies (even through walls), so long as they are not too far away.  They can regenerate health, provided they aren't taking damage.  The Xenomorphs have the shortest (or quickest) campaign, it seemed, but also the most fun.  The Predators specialize in gadgets.  They can cloak which is good for disguising their presence from a distance, but they can't sneak up on humans from behind like Xenomorphs can, and they can be seen even while cloaked by the Xenomorphs, or if they get too close to humans and androids.  Stepping into water also decloaks the pred, as does interacting with elements in the game.  As the Predator campaign progresses they unlock (find) new weapons and an extra view style.  Predators have two razor claws on each forearm to melee with.  They can also get the shoulder cannon, prox mines, disc, and combi stick.  The shoulder cannon produces some splash damage, but a direct hit can kill most humans and xenos.  Using it causes you to decloak though and also drains the limited energy you have, which can only be replenished by finding power sources.  The prox mines can be dropped and remotely detonated, but to be honest, I never used them.  The disc is good for range attacks - you guide the disc with a laser sight and it returns.  A careful aim can take a head off.  The combi stick is the most lethal weapon in your arsenal, provided you aim carefully.  A direct hit will kill humans, xenos, and androids.  The Predator can also leap pretty high/far using a mechanic called ""focus"", which also helps point out things in the environment you might not otherwise see.  The Predator has a ""normal"" human vision mode, a heat vision mode (only good for spotting humans and androids), and sometime midway through the campaign or so you gain a ""gray"" vision mode that allows you to spot Xenomorphs (to the exclusion of other enemies).  The Predator also can zoom in from afar using any mode of vision.  They heal using shards - they can carry 3 at a time.  You feel the most badass as the Predator.Humans (Marines) have it the toughest.  They're an easy, doughy, more meltable target for the other species.  They have a motion tracker, sure, but it's really limited in it's usefulness.  They have a sidearm, but it's really not the weapon of choice when being swarmed by Xenos or charged by a Predator.  They can get the pulse rifle which fires bullets and has a limited capacity grenade launcher.  They can use a shotgun, which is very deadly at close range, and a sniper rifle that's deadly at long range.  I found the sniper rifle to be a pretty useless weapon - good for picking off still targets, but not the aliens.  The best part of the human arsenal is the smartgun, but you're limited on it's availability and ammo, and are forced to drop your main weapon when picking it up (humans can only carry two weapons aside from the sidearm).  For some reason the marines don't get the night vision they had in both the movie and the previous AVP games.  This to me is a sore spot.  They do get flares they can toss, but they are, at best, impractical.  While you can putter your way through the darker areas of the singleplayer campaign putting up with this limitation, it becomes a severe handicap in dark multiplayer games against the other two species.  The humans have 3 health bars.  They can regenerate health in a bar provided they aren't taking damage.  However, if a bar is completely emptied it doesn't regenerate.  In order to fully heal then they need to use a health stim - they can carry 3 at a time.  The human campaign felt the longest to me (probably had something to do with all the dying I did).Control-wise I had issues with all three species.  The controls are at times stiff, clumsy, non-intuitive, and downright frustrating.  Part of the problem, I think, is that the game was clearly designed for controller fondling console gamers first and foremost.  It explains the wanky mechanics, the constant handholding you sense as you play, the strictly linear flow of the missions, and the god-awful item hunt to unlock masturbatory achievements.  The idea is these are 3 species fighting for survival against one another, so why am I expected to waste time snooping around for stupid hidden items that serve neither the plot or your survival?The Marine feels like his boots are made of lead.  He's slow, not particularly responsive, he can barely jump - he can't even crouch behind cover for blueberry muffin's sake!!!  WTH?  He can climb onto waist high crates and stuff, but there are only one or two places in the entire campaign where that's necessary.The Xenomorphs are faster and more agile, but you will often find yourself stuck on surfaces struggling to get off, disoriented by the unpredictability of it's movement mechanics when going from one surface to another, or fighting to get things squarely into view so you can leap into, use an interactive element, or bite into some jerks head.The Predator may fall somewhere between.  He's faster than humans, but not xenos, but he also can't crouch *sigh*.  He can leap high and far, but the mechanics in doing so is more complicated than it needed to be.Multiplayer is where this game should really shine and unfortunately it's a bust.  The game is heavily weighed against the Marines.  So, IF you can find a server to play on, all of the regulars will be either Aliens or Predators.  First off, the Predators and Xenomorphs can one-hit kill the Marines, and because both the Preds and the Xenos can leap long distances, move fast, and track you based on vision - you won't even know what happened half the time.  Remember, Marines don't get night vision, and the tracker is completely useless against opponents that can move so quick you're dead before you even register the blip.  If you're looking for an AVP universe game then this is decent, though I'd still recommend AVP Classic 2000 over this game.  To be honest, I'd recommend Alien Trilogy, Aliens:  Colonial Marines, and Alien: Isolation over this, but they don't have Predators *tear*.  The production values are all there, but the end result fell short of expectation.  Recommended if you are a fan of the franchise or are in desperate need of a decent singleplayer FPS game.			"

												Ever since I was a kid, both ""Aliens"" and the ""Predator"" used to both scare and fascinate me. As a fan of both, I just could not keep myself from buying this game. Which is awesome. Amazing graphics (even though it was released in 2010), fairly interesting single-player campaign story, great and intense atmosphere, a variety of characters, locations, and weapons, and of course - Multiplayer !Oh yes, Multiplayer! And guess what, you can play as either the Marines, the Predators, and even Aliens ! Choose you'r side and hop right in. There are a lot of great multiplayer game-modes. Like the ""Infestation"" for example. Where one marine is infected (an Alien) hunts down the others. Infecing them as well until there is just One-man-Standing. Or there is Survival, or the good-ol' Deathmatch.Anyway, lots of fun. Plenty of decapitations and gore. One of the best games in the franchise.10/10 "

												Three races, three gameplays, but three times less developed. Each campaign has his strengths but they are accompanied by very heavy weaknesses. Whether it's a dated gameplay or progression wobbly, good ideas Rebellion walking systematically over a rake and take the full face. If you cross the solo without actual displeasure, it is never openly enthusiastic about so much platitude. As for the multiplayer full of promise, it suffers from a real softness and wholesale balancing problems.12/20			"

												Ever since I was a kid, both ""Aliens"" and the ""Predator"" used to both scare and fascinate me. As a fan of both, I just could not keep myself from buying this game. Which is awesome. Amazing graphics (even though it was released in 2010), fairly interesting single-player campaign story, great and intense atmosphere, a variety of characters, locations, and weapons, and of course - Multiplayer !Oh yes, Multiplayer! And guess what, you can play as either the Marines, the Predators, and even Aliens ! Choose you'r side and hop right in. There are a lot of great multiplayer game-modes. Like the ""Infestation"" for example. Where one marine is infected (an Alien) hunts down the others. Infecing them as well until there is just One-man-Standing. Or there is Survival, or the good-ol' Deathmatch.Anyway, lots of fun. Plenty of decapitations and gore. One of the best games in the franchise.10/10 "

												A great unexpected movie-game. This puts a whole new type of immersion into first person shooters, to be able to feel that fear of your foe and not always knowing where they are, or when they are about to perform a finishing move on you. The game runs, looks, feels, and plays great. Definitely not what I would have expected from a movie game, it was definitely a step up for that genre, and put a much more hefty, positive definition of that category of games. The game utilizes the storyline and multiplayer very well rewarding the player as they continue to play which is a great addition all games must have but not all do, so that was very well though out.  Overall a game like this was never expected but was hoped for, and was made. And we all enjoy it more than we thought we would for it's new twist on first person shooting games, a twist absolutely for the best.			"

												A good reimagining of the 1999 classic. Good graphics & great sound make for a few hours of fun gameplay. Although each individual campaign is fairly short, combined (and I do suggest playing all three), the game is the same length of most FPSs. Although the storylines are quite linear, they blend into one another to create a wholistic picture of what's happening. Each species also feel very different, allowing the player to really emmerce themselves in any particular campaign. Allround, well worth playing, especially if you're a fan of the previous two games... or any of the movies.			"

												Played the literal crap out of this game since in came out. I used to be impressed by it until I explored every glitch and fault of the game mechanics, the rock paper scissor type of melee and how you can it be abused. It seems the developers did not bother to give a second look at their product or hear the community's requests. As they did with the '99  original Rebellion game, they chose to ignore some of the most iconic sounds, whilst having full access to FOX's movie sound database, but didn't bother to use them (my biggest gripe with the game). I had to rely on Mods in order to make up for it. The pulse rifle literally sounds like sh*t. The mods make it sound like the movie because it gradually cycles through multiple pitches of that ionic sound. I ended up replacing the sound for the smart gun as well, the shoulder cannon, predator vision/cycle, predator taunt, predator idle, heal, trophy and many more...The in game player models are fairly accurate and detailed, unfortunately the same cannot be said about the textures. Everything is bland and lifeless, and all the shaders are glossy, all glowing or looking wet even if not required to be.In trying to balance the three characters in the game some mistakes were made.... The alien sounds like it's got army boots while trying to move around and stalk someone, plus it makes dumb idling noises which have nothing to do with it's nature.They interlaced the three campaigns which is not necessary. The Alien campaign is the most lacking and boring to play.The multiplayer still suffers from glitches and unbalanced play, not to talk about casual cheaters which nobody bothers to ban.Final verdict 6/10 if you are a fan of the franchise and have the nostalgia of the 1999 version of Avp.

												The campaign is short and boring, but the real fun is in MP. The animations of fights are made really nicely and I've really enjoyed unmerciful battles. The best mod is classic DM, where fight all the 3 races. Mainly on the map Refinery, there is a hell if you play on some full server. I preferred to play with a marine, but the other races are funny as well. Predators are easier to learn because to play well with the Alien is seriously hard. I recommend this game to the fans of AvP series, but I think that beginners in the universe can have a fun too because the game is very underrated.			"

												Ehm well this is a good game ussaly games based on movies are crap but this is good. Although 15.00 is expensive considering a 2009 game but this is a great idea for this game. I have been a big fan of AVP since i was a kid i went to the remake of the movie on realease I GOT IN AND I WAS ONLY LIKE 11. I wish they made a second game as  no one plays online anymore and if they do you cant find games because of the  online system. But guys you have to give it credirt as it was made back in 09. I think if they expanded the game on a new version they would sell and balence alien a bit more  and expand preditor weaponds and new species of Alien rather then just zenomorph. i would give this game a 8/10 for its not great MP search engine and the campaign was like you were playing the same mission as a diffrent species but high marks for a great MP idea.

												Let me preface this with the important highlight that ~Multiplayer is DEAD~Now that that's out the way... We have a slightly spooky romp of 4 hours or so through the Marine campaign where your ""IS IT IN THE VENTS OMG"" fear of one alien is replaced with lets-kill-a-hundred-of-these-every-level after the initial 10 minutes.The Alien campaign sucks, tearing 360Â° around the environment at lightning speeds is fun on F-Zero X, not in a FPS while you're being shot at while completely disorientated.Predator has potential but his storyline is one hour long and you never get the chance to really fight the swarthes of enemies his weaponry was just begging to tear up.A dissapointing game that is worth <Â£4.99 of your time, the DX11 specular bump mapping does make for some shiny skinned aliens though I will admit.

												This is actually a very good game.  I joined Steam and bought this as MY VERY FIRST GAME!!!  And I was not let down!  The single player element is tons of fun!!!  You get to play as a marine, predator, or alien and really get enveloped in the roles.  The roles also intertwine which is pretty cool too.  The multiplayer is fun as well but good luck in finding a game.  It's best if you and some friends just start a match against one another.  The MP also allows you to play as all 3 species as well, at the same time :)  I originally bought it for $35 and I thought it was money well spent, so if it ever goes on sale you should definitely get it!!!

												In just over six hours I completed the Alien and Predator campaigns, and made progress in the human campaign. Then I got bored. I uninstalled it and I haven't played it in years.Does that mean I don't recommend it? Hell no.I had a lot of fun with this game, although I wish the ""fun"" campaigns were longer. Now the price is down to $14.99, which is a good deal for what you get. If it goes on sale, it's a no-brainer. Buy this game, be an Alien. Then kill an Alien as a Predator. Then pretend it's Call of Duty and kill everything. Then, (insert something funny).			"

												Well, this was an unexpected little slice of awesome.The first time I actually encountered this particular game was via a review of it courtesy of Yahtzee Croshaw (AKA Zero Punctuation). And I have to say, I'm very glad I decided to satisfy my burning interest in this game.Aliens VS Predator is a game set in (You guessed it) the universe of Ridley Scott's Alien, with the Predators also being featured heavily in this universe. The campaign in the game is divided into three; One for the Marines (which is essentially just Generic Dudebro Filler for all the CoD lovers out there), one for the Aliens/Xenomorphs (which has much more stealth and facebiting), and one for the Predator(s) (which is a combination of the two, minus the facebiting). Each of these campaigns is linked chronologically, with the Alien campaign becoming the starting point, and the reason for the marines turning up in the first place. However, the predators have also turned up since the ever idiotic Weyland Yutani Corporation has unearthed a Predator Pyramid, and open it, unleashing an energy nullifying wave. This not only allows the Aliens to escape, but alerts the predators. The rest I'll let you figure out yourself.As mentioned, the Marine campaign is essentially just a standard sci-fi military shooter with horror elements, and the gameplay is so generic you've likely already seen it before in most shooters; you have your infinite ammo pistol, your shotgun, your machine gun, and to make it seem like you are infact in the Alien world, you have an Alien tracking smartgun.As for the Aliens however, their gameplay is completely different. Success in Alien levels relies on two things: Your mobility and your Stealth abilities. Since you're a Xenomorph, you can crawl through vents, across walls, ceilings etc at a lightning speed, making you incredibly difficult to hit when escaping enemies. Your speed is a double-edged sword however, since if you're not mentally prepared first, you may get a tad queasy; the speed at which you go at and the sometimes automatic wall crawling can be very disorientating. You will likely not notice after a little while however, as in comes the second element of the Aliens; stealth. Now unfortunately, rather than hunting Sigourney Weaver, you're hunting an organised Marine Corp. Or at least that's what they call themselves. More often than not you'll be presented with a room/area full of Dudebro marines, all spouting out repeating (and VERY irritating) lines. You'll then have to pick them off one by one, and if you try and take on multiple marines at once, you will likely get filled with bullet holes for you trouble. Because of this, I do feel that the stealth is rather like the Batman Arkham series of games; you have to take out your enemies slowly and with patience, or you'll be punished severely. However, to make up for this, the killing animations you have access to are incredibly satisfying, if not very f**king brutal; you can stab people in the back with your tail, rip people heads off, expose people to the wonders of facehuggers, or just go all Vlad the Impaler on them with your tail instead. Just remember to clean the s**tstains afterwards.And for the final slice of gameplay: The Predator. In my humble opinion, I feel this is the best of the three campaigns, since it manages to successfully balance Combat and Stealth and ensure the two aren't intertwined when they don't need to be. Not only this, but the gadgets the predator has access to are the most interesting in the game by far; you can mess about with the typical claw gadgets, a combi stick/spear, the plasma projector, a Captain America shield esque saw blade boomerang, and some old-but-gold mines. When you play as a predator, (similarly to the Alien) there will be two main aspects of gameplay you will need: Strategy and (again) Stealth. The strategy comes into play because you'll have to ensure you have some form of battle plan before you go charging in headfirst and get killed by some smarmy chucklef**k with a shotgun. You remember how I mentioned the stealth in this game is similar to the stealth used in Batman Arkham? The similarities are much more prevalent with the predator, who has heat vision, and even a jumping and vantage point system similar to the grappling used in Batman Arkham. However, unlike Batman, you don't leave your prey alive. You collect their heads. You blow them into cartilage with a plasma projector, or just sneak up on them and stick claw gadgets in their back and lift them at least one metre in the air whilst yelling like a caveman who just beat a sabre cat in a fist fight. However, whilst most of the Predator campaign (and gameplay) is very fun and pleasantly challenging in areas, the final boss for this particular campaign is complete and utter horses**t, and nothing else. This particular enemy is not only incredibly aggressive towards you, deals a s**t ton of damage that you cannot block or avoid (unlike with other enemies and bosses the predator encounters), and is also very VERY agile. Agile to the point of you being completely unable to hit it without using mines, which slow you down whilst you arm them and leave you open to an attack. Did I mention the high aggression and high damage? To top it all off, the area where you fight contains destructible platforms, lava that kills you instantly and sticks you back at the start, and also a checkpoint that will stick this c**t right back at full health once you die. There's no checkpoint once he'd down at half health, just anger and foaming mouths. The only upside of this fight is that your energy (which you rely on to help you charge your mines and plasma projector) recharges quickly, a quality that isn't shared with the rest of the campaign. However, this is essentially p***ing in the wind with regards to this bossfight, and doesn't help bury the other s**tty aspects.All in all, a slightly flawed but very enjoyable game that is well worth your time, regardless of whether or not you've actually watched the films this game was based on.8/10			"

												This game is VERY good, but many people seem to dislike the shortness and there seems to be general confusion about the time line and exactly how MANY predators get deployed to handle the xeno outbreak, and why so many if they are the ""best"" fighters. There is also a major plot hole that messes with the entire predator story line. You see in the second mission of the predator you visit the hive and it has already been burned down. Here is where a lot of confusion comes in, as you see by the end of the aliens missions aliens cannot live/function without a queen YET you spend all the predator missions fighting aliens who have NO queen which creates not only a paradox but also a massive plot hole.  The next problem is the humans, not just the marines but all of them. They all do stupid stuff and say ""JEE I WONDER WHAT CAN GO WRONG?"" and these idiots always end up dead. The best example is the distraction function of the predator ""oh whats that? all my squad is dead? well even though i know this for a fact i'm going to walk to where i heard voices"" see the idiocy in this? The stupidity is unbearable if you are trying to play as a marine because the AI for the marines is that of a very stupid 2 year old. Not to mention anyone who has ever tried to harness the power of xenomorphs gets stupider and more moronic each time.  On a gameplay level this game holds up, except the xenomorph because that can be disorienting but it will never be as bad as classic 2000. The predator is very fun to play as but despite how bad the marine AI is they can turn you from a big bad murder machine to a pile of swiss cheese in no time. Which would have to be another problem for me, the guns are not as powerful when you use them, but when any other marine uses the guns they tear you apart. The reason i worded it as ""tear you apart"" is because they cannot do anything when you play as a marine, but the moment you switch to alien or predator they shoot up some kind of meth and become super man.  This AVP game is also a huge improvment from the classic 2000 in many ways. If you tried playing AVP 2000 and found it too confusing, this game is dumbed down and easier to play for the most part. Not to mention that there are HUDS that give you proper directions instead of ""go find the switch that i won't tell you exactly where it is, but i can give you an estimation of about where it might be."" making it easier to get about the place.   Over all this game is worth buying and playing through a few times. It has only a small handfull of bugs that never got out of hand or even bothered me that much, the AI is not to bad for the most part, and it is fun to play as the Alien and Predator if you love having superiority and it's fun to play the marines if you like the horror feel. This game lands an 8/10 on my personal rating.			"

												Multiplayer is okay, as long as you dont 900v1 a marine (the 1 being the marine) with a shotgun. Single shot kill and fast firing guns is bad in multiplayer. And that sniper thing. Or as long as you dont fight a predator with weapons as an alien, you might stand a chance. Oh, and the single player campaings while entertaining, are as short as this review.			"

												While it's a little too easy to perform sync kills on players in multiplayer, the single-player campaigns are great and extremely atmospheric. I'd even go so far as to say that the games are better than the ""Alien"" ""Predator"" movies themselves. Of the three races, however, the Xenomorph (my favorite) lost the most in this updated version. It's more easily  countered by the Colonial Marine and the Predator, and since it only has melee options for combat, you have to get your head around playing in a more conservative style as the Xenomorph.On the plus side, the graphics are a huge improvement over the first ""Aliens vs. Predator"", and the eye-candy is nothing to discount. I would definitely recommend the single-player campaigns, especially as an introduction to the controls, mastery of which you'll definitely need for multiplayer. The Colonial Marine campaign was especially well-done in terms of instilling a sense of fear and anxiety for your Marine's safety.			"

												Good graphic, good story, 3 sides, holding in suspense, Scary for marines, awakes our hunting senses playing as Predator, awaiting in shadows for it prey as Xen.If that will (mostly) looks newest Aliens (Colonial Marine) this game could be a little pushed because AvP like previously AvP games is just short (5-6 levels per side)Anyway game is heavy, with coop based multiplayer because of fighting system, easy to learn, hard to master and looks like - if you or your opponent in 1 on 1 battle do a counter attack you are already dead because you fall and before you stand up you're dead.About single player - 3 sides walking through the same locations having almost common storyline but for sure they are linked together. Good game for playing with friends but some things like Survive mode could be better and there could be more coop modes. But still over 100 hours saying was worthy buying game.It have that what AvP Game should have.			"

												I don't quite know how to summarise this game as a whole, however this review should make it clear about what I think of it. It is an interesting reboot for sure and I was quite excited about if after first hearing the news. As time passed I calmed down and a few years later I finally played it and completed the campaigns for the three races. And to be completely honest the game felt a tad.... bland. It felt like a generic shooter combined with some neat, however crude visuals by today's standards, however I do not form my opinions just based on the appearance of a product. I would like to begin talking about the Marine's campaign. I found it to be more exciting as that of the Xenomorph's (alien), but not as captivating as the Predator's. The movement resembled that of a modern, generic shooter such as all the newer CoD games and I don't know why they bothered adding a jump mechanic to the Marine as it felt very useless compared to the Predator's and Alien's for say. The jump height is ridiculously low, like he jumps only about 5 inches in the air and the climbing mechanics felt jerky, inconsistent and very unrefined. I did appreciate the variety of weapons, I really could make my loadout my own by picking out different types of weapons, however I did not appreciate how the game reset the loadout at the start of a new mission, however I assume the developers wanted them to match to the bland cinematic videos. The story itself wasn't too bad as there were some characters more momorable than others, however the drama of the chestburster being inside the latino girl's chest still wasn't enough to bring it all together, still a better love story than Twilight. Right, onto the Alien, because I want to save the Predator for last. I found Alien's campaign to be the most lame, partly because it felt so short and partly because I felt so insignificant, despite the rather cool beginning of the campaign. The movement mechanics for the Xeno weren't as fun as they were in the old AVP games. The jerkyness and the constant transitioning with jump key (space bar for me) were quite immersion breaking as I didn't feel very graceful as the character furiously jumps through a vent. I find that the lack of the old ""tried and true"" mechanics takes away from the fun as these newer ones feel much more complicated, especially for Alien, but I simply dealt with it, however if they were to make a new  AVP game, I'd like for them to revert back to the simpler and more enjoyable mechanics because they shouldn't fix what's not broken. Okay, now for the hunter. Now this is where the game starts to look much more interesting to me... I like the Predator's equipment a lot, just like in the previous games there is a fair variety of it, although some are more useful than others... Nevertheless I probbaly enjoyed playing as him more than the other races. His helmet and vision took me back to my childhood and reminded me of the badass that hunted the poor â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the jungle. The stealth kills did feel satisfying, however I think the animations felt a bit TOO long as I often got killed while shoving my wristblades into fresh warm meat... Some faster animations would have been nice, something like those found in the new DooM, which is something that the developers should keep in mind if they decide to produce a new AVP title. The stoey of the young hunter made me feel more significant than the other two. I felt powerful, silent yet deadly, which is what the pred is all about. *SPOILER ALERT* His story involved cleaning up the mess created by humans and being a badass while doing it. That's not to say it was excellent, because it was far from it. Of course the events tie together when you play all the campaigns of the races, but it still feels lacking. The cinematic sequences were a tad cheesy sometimes, whereas the landing animations in the first level where the character uncloaks are totally badass. The boss fights also felt weak, especially the final boss for the Predator. I must say I expected more from it, however it will not stop me from recommending this game, because it is something different. It manages to mix in various gameplay styles in a way that is not out of place, instead they are shown through the medium of the three races. Now I cannot comment on the multiplayer as I do not see myself playing it, because I do not have much interest to it, although that might change in the future. Overall, I think this game is a tad under-rated and diserves more attention, I do recommend it and I think is something people should try.			"

												What a game! I would've made some changes though: Add more levels, give an option to remove hints and arrow directions to increase game's difficulty.

												This game is pretty good I guess. The marine campaign does have some serious issues with weapon balance though. I mean a direct hit with a grenade barely hurts an alien but then you get the sniper rifle which kills every alien in one hit? Oh well, at least the shotgun is awesome. The predators are so weak it's hilariously much easier to just evade all fights by cloaking and leaping around. Unfortunately half of the playing time is sucked up by scripted events and cutscenes so I just went back to playing F.E.A.R. instead.			"

												This game is VERY good, but many people seem to dislike the shortness and there seems to be general confusion about the time line and exactly how MANY predators get deployed to handle the xeno outbreak, and why so many if they are the ""best"" fighters. There is also a major plot hole that messes with the entire predator story line. You see in the second mission of the predator you visit the hive and it has already been burned down. Here is where a lot of confusion comes in, as you see by the end of the aliens missions aliens cannot live/function without a queen YET you spend all the predator missions fighting aliens who have NO queen which creates not only a paradox but also a massive plot hole.  The next problem is the humans, not just the marines but all of them. They all do stupid stuff and say ""JEE I WONDER WHAT CAN GO WRONG?"" and these idiots always end up dead. The best example is the distraction function of the predator ""oh whats that? all my squad is dead? well even though i know this for a fact i'm going to walk to where i heard voices"" see the idiocy in this? The stupidity is unbearable if you are trying to play as a marine because the AI for the marines is that of a very stupid 2 year old. Not to mention anyone who has ever tried to harness the power of xenomorphs gets stupider and more moronic each time.  On a gameplay level this game holds up, except the xenomorph because that can be disorienting but it will never be as bad as classic 2000. The predator is very fun to play as but despite how bad the marine AI is they can turn you from a big bad murder machine to a pile of swiss cheese in no time. Which would have to be another problem for me, the guns are not as powerful when you use them, but when any other marine uses the guns they tear you apart. The reason i worded it as ""tear you apart"" is because they cannot do anything when you play as a marine, but the moment you switch to alien or predator they shoot up some kind of meth and become super man.  This AVP game is also a huge improvment from the classic 2000 in many ways. If you tried playing AVP 2000 and found it too confusing, this game is dumbed down and easier to play for the most part. Not to mention that there are HUDS that give you proper directions instead of ""go find the switch that i won't tell you exactly where it is, but i can give you an estimation of about where it might be."" making it easier to get about the place.   Over all this game is worth buying and playing through a few times. It has only a small handfull of bugs that never got out of hand or even bothered me that much, the AI is not to bad for the most part, and it is fun to play as the Alien and Predator if you love having superiority and it's fun to play the marines if you like the horror feel. This game lands an 8/10 on my personal rating.			"

 Story  Aliens vs. Predator has a very short and sweet intertwining story between Aliens, Predators and Marines. So with that said, you play as all 3. If you've seen the Aliens VS. Predator movie, you're stepping into the same idea. There really isn't anything special about the story in any of the 3 campaigns but the best one is Marines in terms of this. Gameplay Each character you play as has their own unique set of skills and weapons. Marines are able to use an assault rifle, shotgun, grenades and pistols. Predators have their scanners, claws, stealth mode, distraction (this obviously won't be in multiplayer), plasma cannon, discs, polearms and mines. Aliens just use their claws and tail and rely on the shadows and speed to gain their kills. Aliens are easily the hardest as they have very little defense and health, but this makes them very fun. Multiplayer Multiplayer in Aliens VS. Predator is among the most broken if not the most broken multiplayer system I have ever seen. I went into multiplayer expecting maybe a little bias towards predators and aliens and thinking maybe it would feel slightly unfair until you got the hang of things.....but there is clearly very little if any skill involved being a Predator. You have to rely on your set of skills as each class like in the campaigns, only Predators have no limit to their gadgets. They don't have to wait for a recharge or take their time to aim their charged shots and so all you will see is them camping up on buildings and using their auto aimed plasma cannons. In the event that they do come and fight you face to face, marines cannot knock them back or stun them making them virtually impossible to kill unless you aren't spotted. As an Alien, it's best to work in numbers like they naturally do. Aliens are fun to play and you can defend against them as a predator or marine making the battles with them even. And you already know that predators can just use their plasma cannons to home in on you nearly instantaneously. Basically, if you want to enjoy multiplayer do not play as the marines unless you're a masochist as they're slow and easy targets. Stick to Predator and Alien for the multiplayer experience and you will have fun. Graphics and sound  This isn't a new game but the graphics and sound are very well done. The only thing that will annoy you is hearing the marines say the same few lines over and over again. But this can be overlooked as the game is fun to play.  Overall Singleplayer will take you about 6-7 hours getting through the 3 small campaigns. Apart from the ridiculous balance issues and frustration that followed realizing this, the game is solid and is fun as an alien or predator in multiplayer, and all 3 are equally fun in the campaign. I just wish singleplayer could've been a lot longer. Recommended on sale.			"

												Single player is alright. Story is passable, with voice acting being average to above average. Graphics are decent, especially on the Alien models. game mechanics, diversity and asemetrical gameplay seems fine at first.Where this game fails is in the multiplayer. Multiplayer is legit broken. Imbalanced maps and species' makes playing this game barely fun at all, and more of a rage quit simulator than anything else. The game is full of camping marines who sit in hard to reach areas/corners with shotguns and sniper rifles. Predators also use instant kill, auto-aim plasma casters. And hard to see, instant kill plasma mines to rack up most of their kills. These types of people are cancerous, because they use the OP weapons and methods, and yet they actually think they're good.Alien is severly underpowered. With no means of a ranged attack, they have to use melee only. The problem is, they can't without dying. Marine shotguns will almost always instant kill you, and sniper rifles will kill you in just 1 or 2 hits. And Predator heavy attacks are literally a second faster than Alien heavy attacks, making melee combat against Predators almost undoable unless the Predator player is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.Some people have told me ""Well, if Predators and Marines are OP, why not just play them?"" Two reasons, 1. I'm a Alien fan, and want to play as Alien. 2. I have way to much self respect to lower myself to the standards of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who don't know how to actually play.

												Very cool game. Story mode offers three different characters to show you the overall plot from a different viewpoint; the rookie Marine handles like a FPS hero against the Xenomorphs, Alien experiment '6' strikes from the shadows to sow panic amongst the humans, and the young Predator hunter is a mix of stealth and brutal offense stalking both races. Completing every campaign will take you through almost all of the same levels, each with differing outcomes, but they all lead to a showdown and tease the same reveal at the end of the game. However, the inclusion of hidden collectibles for each race doesn't add much to the gameplay, except for the Marine. Imagine the audio-logs from Dead Space, but not as great (IMO, at least).			"

												Single player is alright. Story is passable, with voice acting being average to above average. Graphics are decent, especially on the Alien models. game mechanics, diversity and asemetrical gameplay seems fine at first.Where this game fails is in the multiplayer. Multiplayer is legit broken. Imbalanced maps and species' makes playing this game barely fun at all, and more of a rage quit simulator than anything else. The game is full of camping marines who sit in hard to reach areas/corners with shotguns and sniper rifles. Predators also use instant kill, auto-aim plasma casters. And hard to see, instant kill plasma mines to rack up most of their kills. These types of people are cancerous, because they use the OP weapons and methods, and yet they actually think they're good.Alien is severly underpowered. With no means of a ranged attack, they have to use melee only. The problem is, they can't without dying. Marine shotguns will almost always instant kill you, and sniper rifles will kill you in just 1 or 2 hits. And Predator heavy attacks are literally a second faster than Alien heavy attacks, making melee combat against Predators almost undoable unless the Predator player is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.Some people have told me ""Well, if Predators and Marines are OP, why not just play them?"" Two reasons, 1. I'm a Alien fan, and want to play as Alien. 2. I have way to much self respect to lower myself to the standards of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who don't know how to actually play. I refuse to use OP weapons like the Plasma caster, shotgun, sniper rifle, etc.And this problem has plagued the game since its release, and probably is one of the leading causes of the games low amount of online players.

 Story  Aliens vs. Predator has a very short and sweet intertwining story between Aliens, Predators and Marines. So with that said, you play as all 3. If you've seen the Aliens VS. Predator movie, you're stepping into the same idea. There really isn't anything special about the story in any of the 3 campaigns but the best one is Marines in terms of this. Gameplay Each character you play as has their own unique set of skills and weapons. Marines are able to use an assault rifle, shotgun, grenades and pistols. Predators have their scanners, claws, stealth mode, distraction (this obviously won't be in multiplayer), plasma cannon, discs, polearms and mines. Aliens just use their claws and tail and rely on the shadows and speed to gain their kills. Aliens are easily the hardest as they have very little defense and health, but this makes them very fun. Multiplayer Multiplayer in Aliens VS. Predator is among the most broken if not the most broken multiplayer system I have ever seen. I went into multiplayer expecting maybe a little bias towards predators and aliens and thinking maybe it would feel slightly unfair until you got the hang of things.....but there is clearly very little if any skill involved being a Predator. You have to rely on your set of skills as each class like in the campaigns, only Predators have no limit to their gadgets. They don't have to wait for a recharge or take their time to aim their charged shots and so all you will see is them camping up on buildings and using their auto aimed plasma cannons. In the event that they do come and fight you face to face, marines cannot knock them back or stun them making them virtually impossible to kill unless you aren't spotted. As an Alien, it's best to work in numbers like they naturally do. Aliens are fun to play and you can defend against them as a predator or marine making the battles with them even. And you already know that predators can just use their plasma cannons to home in on you nearly instantaneously. Basically, if you want to enjoy multiplayer do not play as the marines unless you're a masochist as they're slow and easy targets. Stick to Predator and Alien for the multiplayer experience and you will have fun. Graphics and sound  This isn't a new game but the graphics and sound are very well done. The only thing that will annoy you is hearing the marines say the same few lines over and over again. But this can be overlooked as the game is fun to play.  Overall Singleplayer will take you about 6-7 hours getting through the 3 small campaigns. Apart from the ridiculous balance issues and frustration that followed realizing this, the game is solid and is fun as an alien or predator in multiplayer, and all 3 are equally fun in the campaign. I just wish singleplayer could've been a lot longer. Recommended on sale.			"

												Good graphic, good story, 3 sides, holding in suspense, Scary for marines, awakes our hunting senses playing as Predator, awaiting in shadows for it prey as Xen.If that will (mostly) looks newest Aliens (Colonial Marine) this game could be a little pushed because AvP like previously AvP games is just short (5-6 levels per side)Anyway game is heavy, with coop based multiplayer because of fighting system, easy to learn, hard to master and looks like - if you or your opponent in 1 on 1 battle do a counter attack you are already dead because you fall and before you stand up you're dead.About single player - 3 sides walking through the same locations having almost common storyline but for sure they are linked together. Good game for playing with friends but some things like Survive mode could be better and there could be more coop modes. But still over 100 hours saying was worthy buying game.It have that what AvP Game should have.			"

												I love this game.  It received many negative reviews, mainly regarding the control scheme.  I had no such problem with the controls, though.  Probably the definitive Aliens AND Predator game!  It brings together everything that's awesome about both franchises in a fun and sometimes challenging FPS.  The alien movements are far superior than the more recent Aliens Colonial Marines.  Wish online play was still an option, but that community trailed off long ago.  This is still worth owning for the campaign mode.Also, finishing moves are always fun to perform and witness!  Impaling predators as an alien, or ripping  out marines' skulls as a predator never gets old.  You can quote me on that.			"

												This game is pretty good I guess. The marine campaign does have some serious issues with weapon balance though. I mean a direct hit with a grenade barely hurts an alien but then you get the sniper rifle which kills every alien in one hit? Oh well, at least the shotgun is awesome. The predators are so weak it's hilariously much easier to just evade all fights by cloaking and leaping around. Unfortunately half of the playing time is sucked up by scripted events and cutscenes so I just went back to playing F.E.A.R. instead.			"

												Aliens vs predators did what Aliens colonial mariens failed to do. they delivered the intensity of the aliens movies with the acion of the predator movies. graphics by far are so much better as well as the Mechanics of the game. This game releashed in 2010 beats out alien colonial mariens which was releashed 2013. Youd think that three years would help improve the technology of graphics, story creativity, etc well in this case the 2006 game took the cake. having already played the first bit of the Marine campaign i can honsetly say it is the better of the two games. Im excited to play as a Xeno and predator soon. Cant wait to see how the stories come together in the end. im just really dissapointed with sega and gearbox having not created the master piece they promised with Aliens colonial mariens. Now with the design of the weapons and set pieces we see some differences because of copy right laws and so forth. Aliens CM was suppose to be as perfect and true to the film because they recieved rights to use audio, original set design to help produce the most authentic Alien game. It was suppose to have elements from the Second Alien game to help give you that feel of being there in the Alien universe but i just couldnt feel that when distracted with the crappy mechanics, gameplay, story etc within the game. In the end get Aliens VS Predators you will have a more enjoyable experiance and overall satisfaction. :D			"

												The Aliens vs Predator games have always had mixed appeal for me. The original had wonderful atmosphere but I never enjoyed the gameplay, nominally because it had poor story but in truth because it so cheerfully kicked my â¥â¥â¥. The 2001 sequel had a stronger (if somewhat convoluted) story and I appreciated the gameplay more (read: it was easier) but -aside from a precious few moments- lacked the terrifying atmosphere that made the franchise so memorable. And what of the 2010 reboot?Like the previous games, the series divides itself into three campaigns; one for each species (Human, Predator and Alien). The human campaign was suitably terrifying; I was vulnerable prey running from deadly and hungry non-terrestrial life. Unfortunately, my deadly array of weaponry even the odds somewhat, minimizing the fear... at least until ammo started to run low. But it was by far the best of the three campaigns.The Alien and Predator campaigns were less satisfying; they were just too deadly to provide much of a challenge.  All three of the campaigns also suffered from very linear levels, although this was less obvious with the Aliens and Predators, who could leap across wide areas with ease, which opened up the maps somewhat; the Humans were limited to tight corridors. The story was improved over the 1999 game but was poorly paced and ended predictably. And the game was incredibly short; about two hours per campaign.But for all its shortcomings, the old-school gameplay of Aliens vs Predator was a welcome change of pace. It might not have ""wowed"" me, but neither did it entirely disappoint. It may have been run-of-the-mill as far as design, but it used the iconic franchise well and it was entertaining to boot.AvP 2010 got poor marks because it was constantly compared to its eleven-year old predecessor (a game which I did not care for); the 2010 edition is more akin to a modern corridor shooter like Call of Duty than the almost deathmatch-like first game. AVP 2010 is much more bound by its story and atmosphere, resulting in a more-tightly paced and scripted experience. Maybe this costs the game in replayability and unpredictability but it is something I found much more entertaining. "

												While it's a little too easy to perform sync kills on players in multiplayer, the single-player campaigns are great and extremely atmospheric. I'd even go so far as to say that the games are better than the ""Alien"" ""Predator"" movies themselves. Of the three races, however, the Xenomorph (my favorite) lost the most in this updated version. It's more easily  countered by the Colonial Marine and the Predator, and since it only has melee options for combat, you have to get your head around playing in a more conservative style as the Xenomorph.On the plus side, the graphics are a huge improvement over the first ""Aliens vs. Predator"", and the eye-candy is nothing to discount. I would definitely recommend the single-player campaigns, especially as an introduction to the controls, mastery of which you'll definitely need for multiplayer. The Colonial Marine campaign was especially well-done in terms of instilling a sense of fear and anxiety for your Marine's safety.			"

												Ok so let's start off with what this game gives you.*3 decent campaigns (pretty short)*Lots of multiplayer maps*3 completely different playstyles*Wide variety of game modes*4 player co-op swarm mode*lots of fun to be had with friends*****************************************This game adds a lot of variety just to begin with and is very fun if you have a bunch of friends.Without friends then maybe not so much. (singleplayer isn't worth more than one playthrough)However the multiplayer is decently active and dont be afraid if you see your favorite gamemodes with no players, just join and wait a couple minutes and others will join you (in order to find matches make sure you have the filter on dedicated internet). So should you buy it? Yes, should you get it on sale? Even better and most definately.			"

												About this game.i would say it is simply o-sum!!!!you can play as a marine or even a predator orrrr.. even an alien.the plot is some what same in all 3 campaigns but the game play is super exciting .the creepiness we feel when we play as a human ,the superiority we feel when we play a predator and stealthiness and devilish feel when we play as a alien is projected throughout the game.if u are a fan of the avp franchise u should definitely go for this game!!! the more the powerful rig you have more good looking the game will be. and the price this current level is not bad(decent).if u want a gruesome ,violent ,head popping ,spine chilling action have no thoughts and go for this game ASAP!

												The Marine campaign has a bad storyline, voice acting, script, characters. On the other hand you have a pretty good Predator and Alien campaign that makes up for it. Another annoying thing is that the people on the comms constantly tell you to go go go. What's the rush? I'm trying to listen to an audio log FFS. I recommend skipping the Marine storyline and play everything else. The graphics are beautiful also. The music is lackluster. The AI is a joke. Weapons that make the game good:+M56 Smartgun+M41A/2 Pulse Rifle+ZX-76 Shotgun+VP78 Pistol (secondary fire all the way)+UA 571-C Automated Sentry Gun-M42C Scoped Rifle-Flamethrower (almost useless)			"

												One of the only AVP Games Ever made (There are other games like Aliens, but not Aliens VS Predator) And its an amazing game, the story is awesome, and the beautiful jungles, temples, and lore really set the autmosphere! The game has great graphics, and awesome animations. Though sometimes it seems like some animations are lacking compared to others. Either sneaking up on an enemy, and pressing E on their back, or stunning them enough to do it from the front, you execute one of many satisfying brutal kills! The sound design is also very awesome! )They included some old sounds from the movies as rare pain sounds, such as the Alien's classic pain sound, and the Predator's snarl.) Its an awesome game, and pretty scary at times. Definetly worth a buy! Recommended!			"

												The game suffers from some species balancing issues and a lack of players, but is an extremely under-appreciated game. I love the Aliens vs. Predator game series, I can't understand why nobody seems to want to play this. I have had a lot of fun playing private matches and local games with my friends, and if that's what you're looking for waste no time and get this game. If you want a short but sweet singleplayer experience that actually does the Aliens justice *cough* Colonial Marines *cough*, I would also recommend this to you. Survival mode is addicting even in singleplayer (Im not sure how non-Aliens/Predator fans would find it but let's be honest, if you're considering buying this game you probably are on some level), and again the Aliens act like actual Aliens, not jittery, poorly animated, erect hitboxes like in Colonial Marines. This is probably the best Aliens experience available today, and again if you are a fan and are okay with being limited to singleplayer and private matches, I say buy this game.			"

												The campaign is way too short compared to its predeccesor Alien vs Predator 2. I finished the Alien campaign in less than 2 hours. I've finished the Alien campaign and will add more stuff when I finish the Predator and Human campaigns. This felt like a cheap way to mooch off the AvP franchise name without putting in any effort to create a game. 6 hours to finish 3 campaigns who reuse the same exact maps is just too fast.Bought it on the Steam Sale for $7.50.PROS1. Interesting FranchiseI mean it's AvP. There are a lot of interesting weapons and technology in the lore.CONS1. Short CampaignWay too short.2. Uninteresting CampaignThe campaign is pretty uninteresting compared to AvP 2. In AvP 2, you actually start off as a Facehugger having to find your first victim, followed by being a Chestburster and feeding on dogs then finally ending off as a Xenomorph. This just starts off as the Alien doing repetitive actions.Press E to do an overly complex action before you kill the creature.3. Alien MovementClunky to say the least. You have to keep holding down Mouse 3 in order to run around smoothly. The view is also limited as you can't turn 360 to see your surroundings when you're hiding on top.4. ViewNo more Alien pheromone view. It's just normal mode with enemies highlighted Red, Blue and Yellow. You kill Red and Blues and harvest Yellows and they have to be in your line of sight.5. Enemiesâ¥â¥â¥â¥ poor variety. Only a machine gunner and a flame thrower for human varieties. Predators were seriously weak, a jump attack and a heavy attack, rinse repeat.6. Human WeaponsA Rifle with a grenade launcher, a flamethrower, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, a pistol and a smart gun. Where's the rocket launcher, plasma rifle, rail gun and your hand grenade?7. Predator WeaponsWhat happened to the Crossbow to rip heads off? Why is the spinning disc so weak? It's like a toy ball.Where is the multi-targetting system in infra-red?How did the Predator staff become so strong and teleport back into your hands after each attack?			"

												Alien vs. Predator is the reboot of the original AVP game but will you want to go back to the originals or give this game a shot ?Alien vs. Predator follows on three story lines.  Dark is the elite predator sent out to check out distress calls from a couple of young blood predators. Specimen 6 is a highly intelligent xenomorph, who one day escapes captivity. Rookie is a marine who crash lands on the planet BG 386 and has to find the way off. The gameplay is quite different through each campaign. The marine is more of a fast paced gun play style. The predator is hack and slash and the Xeno is stealth but you can use stealth in the Predator campaign as well. Everyone controls well apart from the Xeno. The controls are really sluggish and take some time getting used to cause switching walls and climbing them are both a pain in the â¥â¥â¥. Graphics are really good. The nice jungles and factories and the ancient pyramids look nice and some of the death scenes are very well animated. They did a really good job with the graphics apart from some few awful looking Marine and Human models.Audio is alright for the most part. The soundtrack is nothing memorable but it's not horrible either. The audio design is alright. The guns sound great and so do the predators and xenos.The game is overall really easy. The hardest campaign is the marine one where I died the most times. But if you want a real challenge than by all means play all three campaigns on the hardest difficulty level.Level Design is this games biggest problem. The alien campaign is a huge maze and sometimes finding a way to your next objective could be a big pain in the â¥â¥â¥, cause some of the doors lead to nowhere and some lead to a dead end. Even though you play through the same levels multiple times through each campaign the objective layout changes. Overall the level design should have used more work on it.Game is really short. Each campaign took me an hour to beat, apart from the Alien campaign which took me around 2 hours. Apart from collectibles there's not much replay value.  There's not many bugs I could find. Some dead bodies started spazing out and glitch into the walls but overall there's nothing game breaking I could find.I wish there was a middle option to choose. The game isn't good, but it's not bad either. It's a fun game but it get's boring too fast and there's not much replay value. The MP is dead unless you find some people to play with. The game is a way better game than Colonial Marines. My suggestion only get this if you're a massive fan of Alien or Predator and only on sale then you should be good. I give Alien vs. Predator a 6/10			"

												I need to say this. Any Critic that gave this an average review must be crazy. Because this game is so awesome! There are 3 campaigns: Alien, Predator, and the Marine. Even though some people didn't like a certain campaign, so far, I think they are all  great. My favorite is the Marine Campaign because its the campaign that Aliens: Colonial Marines failed to be better than. Predator is really fun, especially when you go silent and then sneak attack them. The same thing goes with the Alien. Game is great. Buy it now.Final Verdict: 8/10+3 campaigns+It's Aliens+It's Predator+Long campaigns for each+Very low price-Glitches and bugs-Some stuff is way to predicatable			"

I like this game and really want to recommend it, however, i can't recommend it these days.I am a fan of AvP franchise and this game was my favourite for a long time. I played the campaign over and over, reached highest level in multiplayer and mastered co-op survival mode. And i'm not a high graphics maniac. But the game is not taking any support, so it is hard to recommend it. No anti-hack, no bugfixes...just have a look at RWS; they're updating POSTAL2 since released. But AvP?

												This could be a lot better, but is definitely a decent game. The engine runs flawlessly smooth and never drops below 60fps for any reason whatsoever. The sounds are great and authentic, sounds just like the movies. Graphics are not bad. I had fun playing as the marine, kicking â¥â¥â¥ with pulse rifles and shotguns. The flamethrower is a disappointment because it is weak but I have never liked flamethrowers in games anyway. Playing as the predator rocks: you can pick aliens up and break them over your knee like a world champ, and tear marines heads off and their spines come out too. The alien is the only disappointing character in the game. It does not control so great and has very little actions. They just did not do much with the alien but then again wtf are you really going to do with something so basic? The last fight for the Alien has you killing three Predators and it just sucks.A pretty fun decent game worthy of a once-through. Would have been a lot better if they made playing as the Alien much better. Catch it on sale and only on sale. 7/10			"

												I've played through this multiple times and I have finally come to a conclusion.Artificial IntelligenceThe marines are beyond stupid, they show no recognition of each others existence and they show no emotion when they discover that one of there comrades has mysteriously and violently died. The Alien AI is also pretty stupid, they run directly towards you or they run up a wall only to jump back down again.Marine CampaignThe Marine campaign consists of walking around empty corridors and reaching marines moments after they die proving that the AI is so unbelievably stupid that the developers have to kill them all off using scripted events, there's no point going into detail about the Marine campaign because its really really generic. If you were looking for a Colonial Marines Squad experience you're out of luck because you spend the entire campaign on your own. Also a fellow Marine called Tequila talks into your ear for most of the game and she will annoy the hell out of you.Alien CampaignThe Alien Campaign starts off quite promising but quickly goes downs hill when you meet the mentally challenged Marines who have no knowledge of each others existence, so you spend the entire campaign scuttling about killing off Marines one by one until the game tells you that you've won.Predator CampaignThe Predator Campaign is really really boring, you simply jump about killing off mentally challenged Marines and having the occasional fight against a group of Aliens using disorientating melee attacks.MultiplayerThe multiplayer is a tiny tiny tiny little bit better than the singleplayer but not something I would pay money for. The multiplayer maps are really small and most of them are recycled from the singleplayer. The multiplayer is almost dead and the currently being attacked by hackers.OverallI can't believe that people are calling this the best game ever because its awful compared to its predecessor Alien vs Predator 2. If you want a real AvP experience then go play Alien vs Predator 2 because its a fantastic game that has stood the test of time.Still better than Aliens: Colonial Marines.			"

												I can't say anything good about this game. I remember playing the older AVP FPS, where you had roughly 10 seconds of battery power for your flashlight before being again in the dark, hunting for ammo, alone in a bitter wasteland, while piecing together pieces of an epic horror storyline centuries in the telling. It was scary, it was blood-pumping. You might spend 20 minutes without seeing an alien, just to s*** your pants when one finally popped out. It was nightmarish. This isn't that. Your pistol has infinite ammo, and your flashlight an infinite battery. You seem to have an enormous amount of flares (i never ran out, i don't know if you can), and health stims seem to be everywhere. The audio logs you pick up seem basically irrelevent, and the voice acting on them seems totally phoned-in. Lance Henricksen does an alright job of it, but you can almost hear the, ""I can't believe I'm doing another one of these"" in his voice. On top of that, the aliens seem to dance around to be sure you can see them before attacking, which they are also terrible at. The alien wall-crawling has been vastly improved; that's one good thing. I remember throwing my keyboard several times back in the day. The alien health regenerates far too quickly. Basically, the game is so forgiving that it ceases to be scary. You can just run through it with little difficulty, knowing that another stim pack is just down the hall. It's not a bad game, but its so obvious that they could have done far better.			"

You can play the story from 3 different perspectives as either Aliens, Predator, Or Marines(Humans). I loved the Singleplayer Campaign but as Good as the Singleplayer is.. it falls way short of the Multiplayer. The Multiplayer is where this game shines. You have different modes to play everything from Survival(which is very horroresque), TDM, DM, etc.. and you have so many unique maps to play. And, you can play from any of the Aliens,Predators,Marines..all with there own unique weapons and skills.I highly recommend this game..			"

												The single player is boring.It does not have any variety or adds anything new to make it interesting.All Campaigns share the same story which while interesting story mode is very slow paced and mostly filler to make the game seem longer.Multiplayer is hard to find matches, and when you do you get lots of hackers cheating and even so the Predators are the most strongest species, while Aliens and Marines are struggles trying to fight against any Predator player. Marines are also way too slow and have hardly any health and all characters constantly lose their balance when melee, making it very hard to get back up or have a fighting chance. SEGA does not update or even fixes any of the game's issues. And the game lags horribly, and almost unplayable due to how much lag the servers have. Steam also does nothing to get rid of cheaters so this gets a bad score and not reccomended. IF THIS IS ON SALE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! IF IT IS AT $3 DO NOT. EVEN IF THE GAME IS GIVEN AS A GIFT OR IS FREE STAY AWAY FROM IT! UNLESS STEAM OR SEGA WANT TO FIX THE GAME'S PROBLEMS THEN MAYBE THE GAME IS WORTH A FEW CENTS.			"

												This game wasn't bad, just not quite as good as I was hoping. All three compaigns were relatively fun and varied, but hampered by some control and gameplay errors. As other reviewers have realized, the marine campaign has the most effort. Only a few problems with them,  such as the inability to switch guns by rolling the mouse. You have to press numbers, and I died countless times while trying to switch in the heat of the battle and pressing the wrong button because I didn't know which gun was 2 or 3. There is also no aim button, and a crouch isn't present either, both dumb exclusions. The campaign is relatively long, if forgettable and muddled. The Alien campaign is super short and the predator is relatively short. The jumping to new ground button with the predator doesn't really work, and is the same button for locking on to attack someone. This is a dumb idea and you usually do the one you aren't trying to.

												The only recommendation I can make for this title is the single player campaign, and maybe the mp coop mode for solo play.  The sp content is marginally worth $15, but only if you're a hardcore AvP fan.  I absolutely donot recommend buying this abandonware for multiplayer content.  Multiplayer for this is all but dead.  Even the boters have abandoned this after they drove off what few players did stick around for the unbalanced, cheap gimmicky gameplay. One of the DLC's has coop maps that may be worth buying to play the coop mode, but personally I wouldn't even recommend that on sale because rebellion simply doesn't deserve any extra $ for failed abandonware like this. The other DLC is all MP maps and is absoluely not worth buying, because no servers run the maps in that DLC.This honestly could have been every bit as good as AvP2 was years ago, but as it has been left by the fail developer, it couldn't even pass for a bloated, festering wort on the a$$ of AvP2.

												Buy when it's: $3.75. Let's get this out of the way: AVP2 from 2001 is still the best. So how does this 2010 reboot fare?STORY: Barebones.All 3 races share the same storyline, so mostly it's just perspective and gameplay that changes. There's some planet, another Weyland android tries to capture aliens to get their technology. Go kill each other. Yeah, story's pretty weak.LEVEL DESIGN: Good variety but reused a lot.Most of the maps will be the exact same for all 3 campaigns, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Each level is actually designed to be navigated in different ways depending on your species: the Aliens will go around walls and through vents, the Predators will hop across distances and heights, while Humans will walk horizontally. PREDATOR GAMEPLAY: Fun, but not many combat options.You wish you could toy with your prey more, but the game encourages you to go fist-to-fist. You only get the diskus and the combistick (which can only be thrown) very late in the game, so most of the time, you're just trying to stealth and sneak behind for a quick dramatic kill. It also sucks that you get UNLIMITED CLOAKING, which takes away the suspense of running out of power at exactly the last second.MARINE GAMEPLAY: Good atmosphere, but few weapons.I love the level where you try to escape from a Night Club. You never see this in a space horror game: you're the last survivor trying to get out of a failed rescue mission, and then ... the music blasts, so you're fighting off hordes of aliens while dancing to the music. Unfortunately, you're stuck using the very basic autorifle or pistol most of the time, with the shotgun, flamethrower, and smartgun making an extrance very late in the game. ALIENS GAMEPLAY: Short, and feels weak.You don't have the ""Press E for pounce"" anymore. Instead, you have to hold SHIFT and target an enemy in order to leap onto them. Attacks also feel clunky, and not fluid. You only play as a regular alien drone, never a facehugger, praetorian, or predalien. I really thought you'd play as a predalien, but no. OVERALL: Not bad, but nothing special.Rating: 6/10.			"

												Singleplayer:The game is amazing especially since your not just one race, you get to play all 3 and each has its own story. I went from Humans to Predators to Aliens and found the Aliens a bit disappointing. Compared to the humans and predators, the Alien campaign was like half the length.Multiplayer:DO NOT BUY THE DLC. The DLC is made for multiplayer and multiplayer alone. Why do i say not buy it? Because the online is DEAD. There is no one in ranked or player matches, i was the only one searching for a game so don't waste your money on the DLC unless you plan on doing the survivor maps with friends.Overall:Pretty good game besides there being no one playing online so do not buy it at the price its at now, wait for a sale because all your getting is the campaign. Story alone is amazing and i got a good amount of hours out of it, you can go back and play on a harder difficulty if you want or get the achievements which i plan on doing later.			"

												Its totaly fun to play this game... u can choose between Aliens , Predator and Marines With different kinds.Predator has 8 different skins, Alien has 6 different skins and marines 9! U unlock those skins by playing as them to level up. All I can say for now the rest u have to find out by playing it since everyone has his own opinion! :)			"

												Honestley if this wasn't an aliens versus predator game it would not recieve the recognition it does, and it would be down right bad. Overall, this is a slightly below average game that lacks any polish whatsoever. I'm gonna say right now, I like the aliens vs. predator franchise, but I'm not a die hard fan who knows every single thing about it, so this isn't biased in any way.This is gonna be a long â¥â¥â¥ review, so let's break this down bit by bit.---Sound---Score is okay, if a little generic, but there's this one suspenseful orchestra hit that constantly sounds everytime you look at anything, and it's very distracting and out of place. Also, everytime you get an objective as a Marine, it plays the steam message notification sound, or at least something really similiar, but I'm pretty sure that's it. Voice acting is absolute garbage, unenthusiastic and monotone characters with generic voice samples and personalities. Guns sound okay overall, and the rifle sounds like it did in the movies, so that's a plus.---Graphics---This came out 2010, and while it's not ugly, it's not impressive either. The animations are fine, but the shadows are terrible, if you do anything while looking at your shadow, it's stiff and unnatural looking. The executions are pretty freakin cool, and about the only above average thing about this game. Unfortunately, you never see them, cause they're slow, allow enemies to hit you while you preform them, and give no reward or incentive for using them.---Campaigns--->MarineLack-luster, run of the mill shooter with a few interesting gimmicks that ultimatley do little to enhance the overall game. The motion tracker is neat, and I'm glad they decided to implment it, but it honestley isn't very usefull. Enemies are quite noticable and don't really sneak up on you, like the Aliens should. Controls are rather mediocre, they certainley work and will get the job done, but they're nothing to write home about. You can't crouch, and there are no iron sights, which doesn't matter too much, but it goes a long way to illustrate my point that this game lacks any sort of polish. Story is boring, completely generic characters and horrible, unenthusiastic voice acting. Not much variety to the enviroments.The weapons are cool, however the placement of the weapons is odd, you'll get a sniper rifle in a long hallway, and a shotgun in a sprawling forest. The smart gun was cool, the two times it shows up. However, at the beginning of the chapters  your weapons are stripped away and your given whatever the developers decided you should have. So if you've, say, saved up a bunch of shotgun ammo for an ambush, it's all lost and you get a rtifle you can't even use in close combat.The bosses aren't very creative either. I mean, fighting the predator and mega alien is kinda cool, but it really is just more shoot it till it's dead. It just takes more ammo this time.The final boss is some random â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ with a shotgun. The shotgun kills you in two hits, one if you're close. Using the same shotgun against him, just another human (without any body armor even, which you have) take at least twenty to twenty five shots to kill him. To top it all off, when I lowered the difficulty, just to finish this miserable campaign, it reset me to the beginning of the chapter, forcing me to play more of this â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. The ending of the boss fight is some boring call of duty quick time event. Wow.Pretty standard spoiler bait ending. Meh.>AlienThis is the only reason this game is worth your time. Decent stealth-action gameplay, and actually a pretty fun experience. Controls are worse here, the movement isn't intuitive at all, having to press a button to jump from wall to wall is weird, and the camera is an abosolut nightmare.. Camera is akward and hard to control. Also, breaking stealth is not an option, you get gunned down pretty damn fast, which is fair, but I seem to recall the other aliens being a lot more resillient to damage, so why isn't the super special main character alien poweful? Story here is actually fairly interesting, but again, nothing groundbreaking. It's a shame thre isn't more of this, cause it's where the game shines.>Predator Oh boy, this is the nail in the coffin. The predator campaign is bad, period. Stealth doesn't function. The cloak does nothing once you move in on a marine, and it doesn't work on aliens period. The combat is atrocious, mash left bumper until it dies, and hope you have enough health not to yourself. The heavy attack is supposed to be used to block guards, but it's too slow to use at all. Enemies will counter you if you break their guard, which the heavy attack SHOULD fix, but it won't because it's useless so you'll just take the hit and keep mashing. Guard works, but again, no point. Now, if the whole campaign was like this it would be nearly unplayable, as marines simply have too high dps to take out in a group of more than two. However, you get a throwing disk and spear, that will, nine times out of ten, kill enemies immediatley. This would be okay, but they have basically no cool down, like the other powerful weapons do. So, the melee is broken and the throwing weapons kill people instantly, what happens? Melee becomes obsolete, and the predator campaign becomes a weird clunky shooter. You no longer use your cool gadgets, or any melee attacks or special executions, you simply throw, wait, throw, wait, again and again and again, until you clear the campaign, which is roughly three hours playing on normal difficulty. Now, maybe it would be more challenging on a higher difficulty, but it would still be an unplayable broken mess.Not to mention the jump requires you to look at a ledge, hold left trigger, or whatever the mouse and keyboard equivalent is, make sure it shows you the notification, and then press A. It's not game breaking, but it's an unnecessary step that slows the game farther.There were two bosses, on was just a regular enemy with more health, that I just threw â¥â¥â¥â¥ at. The other was a horrible three stage fight, and overpowered fast enemy that broke the stage up, and could instant kill you by pulling you into lava halfway through the fight, at which point you restart from the beginning of the fight and have to watch the boring thirty second cutscenes again.""But, was it fun?"", you ask. No, I just threw â¥â¥â¥â¥ at it.The story was just as rushed and bland as the marine. ""Some of our friends died and we need you to get the equipment back and kill all the humans cause they shouldn't be here."" That's it, that's the whole plot.I'm sure theres more to say bout the absolutley abysmal Predator campaign, but I'm not gonna dwell on it anymore.The campaigns just weren't that fun. Alien was okay, but the other two I found myself wishing for the end of. Marines got boring pretty quickly, and predator was bad throughout.I can't speak for the multiplayer, but I'm willing to go out on a limb and say it's probably not that interesting or fun, cause it's more of this. Most generic, B-rated games don't have much in the multiplayer field anyway. Also, it's likely dead, as this has been out for lik, six years.Finally, this game is short. It took me about two to three hours to beat the predator campaign, about an hour and a half for the Alien, and maybe four for the Marine. For a fifteen dollar game, that's short, especially one with three campaigns.That's all I want to say about this game. It isn't overly broken or unplyable, it's just not good at all. If you are an absolute die hard Aliens vs. Predator fan, then you might like this. If not, it is not worth your money.			"

												1- GENERAL AVP is a FPS based on the well known cinema saga with the same name. Rebellion produces this new game, and imo they have caught most of the good aspects of the movies. The different campaigns are the most known aspect of the game, and since the game is from 2010, with a dead multiplayer it's the only thing I can judge. All campaigns are well built, despite the fact we always get the feeling that the Alien one is always going with the flow. All campaigns seem well connected, and if you play all at the same time the plot becomes a bitt better. Graphics are OK for a 2010 game, and with direct x 11 it's a kinda interesting game. Sound is very immersive, especially the Predator sounds. 2- GAMEPLAY This game tries to gather some different mechanics, none of those in a specially good manner. If you play as a Marine you will have a more regular FPS experience. The game is kinda darkish, maybe to give some jumpscares, but it fails bigtime. I have not find noticeable bugs, but not being able to crouch is kinda odd. Weapons seem a bit weak, but in the other hand we can melee the Aliens with our hands... The base of the Predator's campaign is stealth, and being able to choose the proper resource of his arsenal. We only have access to the best weapons near the end of the game, and that's unfortunate. Also unfortunate the fact of the plasma custer intensive use of our energy. I love to see the red target forming, and I always choose other weapon just to save energy. Aliens have to use the shadows and their speed, but the controls are very confusing, with some learning curve to adapt to all the twists and turns that we will see. Try not to vomit... much. When we see the alien from the Marine or Predator's perspective their movements seem very elegant, and very well designed, it's a shame that those same movements do not feel the same when we are controlling them. We have some fatality moves. They are quite cool, but after we see all of them they became annoying, since we are exposed to other opponents when we are performing them, and they can take quite a while to finish. 3- CONCLUSION AVP is now marked at 14,99â¬. Before you buy the game you have to keep in mind that this game does not excels in any aspect. Not a especially good FPS, not a remarkable stealth game, not impressive melee hunting game. So what to do? All the interesting environment around AVP game is well built, and if you are a fan of the series you will like this game. On top of that, the game is easy to find in any sale at a very cheap price. So this can be fun for everyone. Be sure to give it a go.As usual, som footage taken from my walktrough.

												While people may have disliked the game, I liked it. It is far from great, it is baraely good, but for all the bad things there is something good. The marine is alright, except for the no crouch, which really is a pain in the combat droids, and the fact that you start with a selection of weapons not necesarly the ones you had at the end of the other. The Alien is fun, but a bit short. And the Best is the Predator, which plays stealthy for humans, which could've been more open-ended, and a sh*tty hack-and-slash for aliens, but I like it.			"

												This game is somewhat underrated. I agree that the three campaigns are really short (2-4 hours each!), but change the difficulty to hard, and I promise you your heath will be pumping (if you die you'll have to start all over). I had a lot of fun completing this game on hard, and the campaigns also seem somewhat longer, since you can't just charge in and kill everything. For the current price the single player is well worth it, since it catches the alien, predator, human aspects pretty well.The multiplayer part could have been fun, but it just seems somehow unbalanced. Either way, multiplayer is close to dead. This also means that you have no chance to get all the achievements, since you'll need 18060 XP for one of them, and you don't earn a lot of XP in each match. Also, don't buy the map pack (since noone is playing).			"

Great graphics.Pros:The 3 campaigns are amazing, though the alien campaign was shorter than the rest, it was still my favorite.The Achievements are quite challenging, but fun. most of them have references from the movies. Cons:The alien is quite unfair to play as in multiplayer if you have a high ping. They can just go behind you and do a instant kill grab.DLC:All the DLC are maps, I was hoping for a another few campaigns.But at the end, this game is quite fun and challenging, and i do recommend it.

The fact that all three races are playable and unique in story and feel is awesome. I'm a huge predator fan and xenomorphs are ok too, so I have no idea how I missed this games release back in 2010.

												What can I say about this game? Well, the gameplay is is great. Each character you play as (The marine, the alien, the predator) feels unique and interesting to play. This game makes you favor caution over balls to the wall action, and it harkens back to the days of old school get the highest score games. The story is interesting, and this game is a must have for any fan of the Alien or predator franchise. That, however, is where my praise ends. this game is short. Six hours short, to be exact. That's how long it took me to beat it. Now, the only thing that will keep you comming back is the differing difficulties, and the fact that this game is fun to play. If you're not a fan of alien, or predator, don't worry. This game stands out on its own. I recomend getting it on sale, as $15 is a little more than this game deserves, in my opinion. I just wish the multiplayer was alive. But there's not much I can do on that front.			"

Graphics are still pretty impressive. Gameplay is simple, but fun. AI can be a bit iffy, but it never really bothered me. Plot is also straightforward and simple, but still better than either AvP film.
