												Most people probably won't play much if anything of Blue Shift, so here's what you need to know for future installments if you skip this one: You play as Barney and nothing he does in this game is ever brought up later in the series. Yeah, Barney is sort of a main character in Half-Life 2, but this game manages to not get mentioned once throughout that one. Kind of weird, huh?The thing about Blue Shift is that it isn't a bad game-far from it, actually, but when compared to the other games in the Half-Life 1 ""series"" it's just sort of there. Opposing Force introduced new weapons, music, characters and a lot to keep it fresh, while Blue Shift doesn't add a single thing and just rides on the coat tails of the fame that came from games before it.So how is Blue Shift (which I just realized has the acronym BS, teehee) not terrible, since I'm bashing it so? Well, it sticks to the core Half-Life gameplay as I said, and you really can't go wrong with it. It's fast paced, balanced, well designed, and is very atmospheric if you allow yourself to be immersed into it. But despite all this, if you've played the games before it, than Blue Shift is just... boring. I don't want to be too rude, because I really do think this is a good game, but there just isn't enough new stuff in Blue Shift to keep it interesting,It reuses Opposing Force's soundtrack, gives you only three fourths of the first game's weapons, and the story is...oh, right! That's a good part! G-Man (a staple of the series) only appears once, in the beginning of the game. He's even absent from the ending. This may sound lame, but it's sort of assumed by now that G-man would be really prominent, so having him just show up once is a surprising and welcome twist. And when you think about it, it even makes sense! Why WOULD G-Man bother following some random security guard? It's actually kind of genius in a way. Oh yeah also the way they explain teleportation is absolutely brilliant and makes a lot of sense (no I'm not being sarcastic) and this is seriously the best explanation of teleportation I've seen in my life.So, in conclusion, Blue Shift is.. okay. It doesn't pack the punch of the other games in the Half-Life Series (let's just pretend Decay doesn't exist,) and really doesn't have a purpose since it has no bearing on the story, but it's okay and can be occasionally genius when it comes to the story. It's too much of a rehash for me to really love it, but it certainly won't upset any Half-Life purists.			"

												you either play as a purple dinosaur or as a caveman10/10------Okay, I didn't expect this to get much attention. Here's an actual review:------Half-Life: Blue Shift is simply more Half-Life. If you loved Half-Life: Opposing Force, the first expansion, you'll probably be very dissapointed with this one, because it adds no new weapons or enemies, but this dosen't mean the game is bad. Also, the game is very short aswell (ignore my playtime). Other than those two problems, the game is actually pretty good, but I would only recommend it to Half-Life fans like myself.If you have to choose between this and Opposing Force, pick the second option, it's miles ahead better than this.

												Blue shift is, practically, any decrease in wavelength. Oh, wait, it is also the expansion pack (the 2nd one) for the critically acclaimed game Half Life! And this one was also developed by Gearbox. Interestingly, it came more than a year after Opposing Force, the 1st expansion pack, and while that one packed a punch, Blue Shift did not really offer anything new.So, there is no real new content here: no new weapons, enemies or new music. But! It is Half Life! And also, you control Barney! The security officer who was bashing the door when you were riding the train with Gordon in the base game. And this is why I liked in Opposing Force, as well. How the new protagonist's story was connected to that of Gordon. You could see a familiar locale in the distance (when in the helicopter in the beginning) or the aforementioned example of the security guard. In any case, while Blue Shift did not really offer anything new (graphics-wise it came with a neat high-res texture pack, though), it offered the same cool atmosphere we loved Half Life for.Blue Shift is a short but all the more entertaining ride! Highly recommended to all Half Life fans!			"

												Blue Shift is the second expansion to Half Life. Released in 2001, 3 years after the original game. The development was handled by Gearbox - who one day would create games like Brothers in Arms and Borderlands. Blue Shift, was in fact their second game, so you could say that Gearbox was still in the process of learning. The game consists of 5 lengthy chapters and 3 ""5 min"" chapters. I finished the game in 5 hours, so as you see, it's a pretty short game.One thing that i did not like is that the plot did not really collide with the plot of Half Life 1 all that much. There were a few cameos, but overall it felt really separated. Basically, you help a group of scientists fix the teleporter and teleport out of the Black Mesa facility. The only cameo is at the start of the game when you see Gordon riding the train.Gameplay wise, it's basically the same as the original game, except there are no ""Class 4"" Type weapons (gravity guns and such). The game also has a few puzzles here and there.In the end though, i like the first expansion (Opposing Force) much more. It had it's own identity i would say.This expansion is short, pretty much all assets are reused from the original Half Life, and thematically it just does not do a good job, unlike its predecessor - Opposing Force.

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE:Also see my: Half-Life (1) ReviewHalf-Life 2 ReviewHalf-Life: Opposing Force ReviewBlack Mesa ReviewINTRODUCTION:Half-Life: Blue Shift is a first-person action game by Gearbox Software and Valve and serves as the third official expansion to the Half-Life franchise.  Unlike Half-Life or Half-Life: Opposing Force, Blue Shift does not introduce new game mechanics; rather, it offers a new type of narrative storytelling through constant interactions with an NPC character (i.e., Dr. Rosenberg).In this game, you step into the shoes of Black Mesa Security Guard and Clone Template Barney Calhoun, a man whose normal routine of offering beers and guarding doors is shattered with a catastrophic accident that opens the facility to an alien invasion and U.S. Military intervention (a direct result of Dr. Freeman's experiment from the first game).  As Barney Calhoun, you try to survive the alien invasion, protect the survivors, and escape the now doomed Black Mesa Research Facility.PROS:+ Good story (NO SPOILERS) that serves as the 'final link' that connects every story (Half-Life, Half-Life: Opposing Force and Half-Life: Decay) of the Black Mesa Incident together.+ Constant interaction with an NPC that is essential to the plot rather than for opening doors+ The first game in the franchise to introduce 'HD' content during its time+ Intense action as can be expected from a Half-Life game+ Satisfying puzzles+ Adaptive enemy AI, especially with the soldiers+ Great level design+ Barney can kill dangerous aliens and highly trained military soldiers wearing only a flak vest and an almost transparent plastic helmet as protection (He would be perfect in the Warhammer 40,000 universe as an Imperial Guardsman).CONS:- VERY SHORT and possibly the shortest game I ever played with only 3 hours of playtime on Hard Mode and Training Tutorial- Existence of bugs despite being 14 years old (Particularly a bug where you're unable to move)- No new weapons, enemy, or gameplay mechanics.- Most weapons from the first game were removed- Relatively easy (even on hard mode) as compared to the other games.  In my opinion, it is because acquiring 'armor' and health kits are a lot easier.CONCLUSION:Story and lore wise, Blue Shift is GOOD but other than that, it does not offer any new content aside from the new player perspective of the overall Half-Life Lore.  In my opinion, Blue Shift is not an expansion but more of a DLC (downloadable content) than anything else, which is not a bad thing by the way, especially one with a good story and fun action sequences.So do you buy Blue Shift?  YES but DO NOT BUY Blue Shift alone! Instead, purchase Half-Life Anthology if you already have Half-Life 2 or get Half-Life Complete. --------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Nostalgia! Just like Half Life, and Half Life: Opposing Force. This game ""Half Life: Blue Shift"" is pure nostalgia! You are security officer Barney Calhoun at the Black Mesa Research Facility and just like the plot for Half Life. You are to fight your way out of the godforsaken research facility as it comes under attack by the military and Xen Forces. This game isn't as long as the original game, just bear that in mind.Everything about the original game will be in this one, or at least some elements anyways. Only this time around you explore different parts of the facility through the POV of Calhoun and not Freeman, Same goes for Opposing Force. If you love the Half Life series, get the Half Life 1 anathology pack that contains (Half Life, Blue Shift, Opposing Force, and Team Fortress Classic) as it's on sale right now for Steam Summer sale for only $3.74!

												Half Life 1 was a fantastic first person shooting game released somewhere around 1999. This Blue Shift is the second rather dull expansion pack for Half Life 1. To be blunt, the first expansion Opposing Force is better, because it offers more guns, new gameplay mechanics and a lot of new monsters. Blue Shift however offers nothing new except new levels that will take you under 4 hours to complete the first time around.Blue Shift takes you through Black Mesa and Xen once again when everything goes wrong and aliens invade. You start the expansion riding the tram to work (just like Half Life 1) after taking an optional training course that is literally the same training course from Half Life 1.The gameplay is more challenging than the original game in both good and bad ways. The good way is the game shows off its artificial intelligence by pitting you... Barney Calhoun, a blue shift security guard at Black Mesa, against hundreds of marines sent into the Black Mesa facility. Usually you fight 10 marines at a time in wide open areas. The enemies will scatter when you throw grenades, run away from you, try to flank you and fan out so you're not shooting enemies like dominoes.The negative ways that the expansion is challenging comes from several dark areas with dozens of head crabs jumping at you around every turn. It feels cheap compared to Half Life 1 and Opposing Force.There are a few shining lights for this expansion and that is rescuing scientists, although it's not much of a rescue, because any of them can die and it doesn't matter. The expansion also dabbles in having an important character Dr. Rosenburg that you will rescue and he will guide you to the end of the expansion. Guide you as in briefly tell you what to do through believable voice acting.In all this is a lackluster expansion compared to the previous one and feels more like a level pack... without levels, just one continuous game. Chances are you can get this expansion with one of the deluxe Half Life 1 games, so save some money and get Blue Shift there instead.			"

												You should really only play this if you like Half-Life. You play as Barney, one of the disposable security guards that you killed for their ammo after they were of no use to you in Half-Life's single player. The campaign is short; it took me about 3 hours to complete. There is no multiplayer, there are no new weapons, no new enemies, and only a handful of new characters. This is like Opposing Force in that it's a new perspective on Half-Life's story, but that's it.Recommended only if you like Half-Life's story.7/10			"

												Half-Life: Blue Shift was released in 2001 as the second Gearbox Half-Life expansion. In this game, you play as Barney Calhoun, a Black Mesa security guard during the time of the original Half-Life's Resonance Cascade, and the subsequent invasion of Black Mesa by the US military in attempt to cover the event up.The game is similar to Opposing Force in that it illustrates a part of the world of Half-Life during the time of the Resonance Cascade, though from the eyes of someone other than Gordon Freeman. In Blue Shift's case, you start in a similar environment to Gordon within the depths of the Black Mesa Research Facility as an employee there, and after a casual introduction into basic mechanics and the neat environment Barney works in, you're thrown into combat quickly after the Cascade hits within 15 minutes into the game.Most of the basic weaponry Gordon has in Half-Life can be used by Barney, from the Shotgun to the Revolver to the Crowbar, and the plot surrounds Barney's attempt to escape Black Mesa and resist against US marines who are pouring in to the facility to cover the whole Cascade up, along the way, you'll solve puzzles, fight baddies, and help scientists to find the way for yourself and others to escape the doomed facility before the impending nuclear destruction of the facility kills your chances.The game itself is pretty great; because it was built around the same engine and built around Half-Life as an independent game, it resists many problems itself; most being attributable to those that Half-Life had itself (the flashlight that could stick to surfaces across the room). That being said, the game has a few glitches (saves breaking, certain elevator scenes near the beginning leading to game-overs, Gordon getting stuck on the tram tracks, etc) but none that were utterly game-breaking or capable of ruining the player's experience.That being said, this game's main problem is its length and the amount of content it introduces. While Opposing Force, the previous Gearbox Half-Life expansion, had within it a fairly long plot, introduced many new weapons, aliens, and even had a boss battle, Blue Shift is fairly short and doesn't really introduce new weapons, (that being said, most of them to my knoweldge use different skins) and in my opinion, serves more as a compliment to the original game by allowing fans of Half-Life to see more of Black Mesa behind the scenes.To summarize: In my opinion the game is great and is my personal favorite of the Half-Life expansions and vies with Half-Life 1 for the best original Half-Life title; I've always enjoyed the character of Barney Calhoun, and I find it enjoyable that there's an entire expansion detailing his own escape from the Black Mesa complex. However, I do recognize the flaws that this game has: This game doesn't introduce as much content as Opposing Force did to be considered a different title from Half-Life, and isn't as long as either Opposing Force or Half-Life to have as much of an impact on the average player post-completion. That all being said, I enjoyed what it was, the narrative and story was solid, and I enjoyed the chance to see the Resonance Cascade and the subsequent invasion of Black Mesa from the eyes of Barney. The game has a certain narrative to it that creates an interesting environment that compliments the plot, and because of its length, you spend more time with other characters and as such are able to more greatly build an understanding of their character because you spend more time together. While it's short and doesn't add much to the Half-Life universe, I myself liked it and found it enjoyable, even if it's only around 2-3 hours long in comparison to the original Half-Life being around 10-12 hours in length.In the end, the game's narrative and plot outshine its gameplay for me; it's interesting to see the quest of a security guard escaping Black Mesa while it's under seize by Xen creatures and the military, and the ending is a complete contrast of the ending of Half-Life, and I can't help but feeling like it hit all its narrative marks in those regards.I myself recommend it, but whether you want to pay 5 bucks for something like this is your opinion in the end. That being said, I myself got it as a part of the Half Life Complete Steam Bundle, which goes on sale during every major seasonal Steam sale. If you were thinking of getting this title or any of the other games in the Half-Life franchise, I'd suggest you turn to that bundle during a sale, as you get discounts for all the games if you buy it, so it's cheaper than buying each game individually.

One words review: Amazing!Half-Life: Blue Shift is an awesome Add-on to the original Half-Life franchise! developed by Gearbox Software and published by Valve on Jun, 2001. In this expansion you play as ""Barney Calhoun""; a mid-level security officer at the Black Mesa Research Facility who will became an actual standalone character with a great impact in the later Half-Life games, it's the day of the Black Mesa incident and your mission is to escape the alien invasion with the help of ""Dr. Rosenberg"" using some kind of old technology portal while fighting both aliens and army. The story is really good and enjoyable with an awesome ending ( it's still cool even despite the fact that there is no final boss fight ), but sadly .. it's the shortest of the 4 expansions! the good thing is that it presents some new levels and areas of Black Mesa, yet no new weapons or enemies at all i don't need to talk about the graphics & voice acting, the expansion was released 15 years ago and yet they still good for nowadays and they don't have any bad impact on the game-play. Tbh, it was really nice to play as ""Calhoun""and i loved how the story was mixed-in with the original story .. you can clearly see how many connections between them exists here. Overall, if you loved the original half-life you should definitely try this one too! it's a great addition to the HL series and i recommend it to everyone, it doesn't matter if you are a huge fan or a newbie! just buy it now!       Final Score: 9/10			"

												This thing is short but sweet. Its basically is a mini package of the original Half-Life with some of the level tropes that were in the original. Some puzzles were also a little challenging and took me quite some time to figure it out. However, I think I finished this in nearly... 2 hours 20 minutes, could be done in less than 3 hours. There were some cameos from the original game, including Gordon Freeman if you're interested.However, I'd suggest you buy it as part of a bundle like Half-Life Complete or the Half-Life 1 Anthology, especially when on sale, cause this short but sweet thing is less than 3 hours long, and its priced at 5$, a price that can get you more with other games.

												Very good addon to the Half - Life. In Half-Life: Blue Shift, the player takes on the role of Barney Calhoun - security guard of  Black Mesa, who trying escape from Black Mesa after Dr.Freeman's experiment fail. Main diference from other addon -  Opposing Force - presence of monsters from the base game only. Arsenal of weapons is also very narrowed, even in comparison with original Half - Life. The main drawback - game is very short. Not very - VERY VERY SHORT. I played at hard difficulty - spent only 4.5 hours for game walkthrough.P.S. We will meet with Barney Calhoun in Half - Life 2)7.5/10			"

												This game is really good, much better than Opposing Force. Gone are the stupid weapons and enemies and back are the really good ones from the original. The first half of the game the quality of the mapping is about the same as Opposing Force’s, but in the second half it does get a lot better. There is also a considerably better flow and story compared to Opposing Force, here there actually is one compared to the no existent one in Opposing Force.There are no reused sections, although some did seem to take a lot of inspiration from Half-Life’s. However there is a heavy use of sections where you need to go a long way around just to open a door, this is done multiple times. Also not all the weapons are used, this is a good thing is some ways since everything in this game was not out of place, but there are still some non-energy\Xen weapons that are not used.The main problem with the game is that is it too short, it really does feel like they made half the game, then ran out of time. This would explain the lake of weapons and also the lack of difficulty increase, there is no end boss and the end point does feel like a mid-point.But this game is really good, if you had to choose between this and Opposing Force, choose this. Opposing Force was not that great, this however is really good, in some ways better than Half-Life.			"

												It's a short 2 hour expansion, and compared to the base game and Opposing force, it seems lacking.However, it was originally for the HL dreamcast port, but when that got scrapped, this and the HD models were salvaged for the PC. It clearly shows, as the game tends to take place in more closed areas, but for 2 hours, it's not bad.The game likes to tease you with the armor chargers, as you can't use them since you don't use a suit, but a regular old vest and helmet, like CS.In all, it does lack any new content, but it takes HL and compresses it really nicely, and I think people give it a little bit more crap than it deserves.

Blue Shift is fine if you feel like shooting through a bit of Black Mesa and moving some boxes and barrels around, it just ends up being a little underwhelming. Don't expect any new interesting weapons. Visuals are dated, but that's to be expected. It's worth playing if you're a fan of Half Life and have a few hours to kill.			"

												Best part of the game: Watching Gordon get dragged by the two grunts whose heads I'd love to smash with a brick. Not because the game is bad and that's the best it offered. Just because I love when games/sagas or, in this case, the expansions of a game connect with each other in such direct ways. Blue Shift was pretty good. Incredibly short, it takes the average gamer four hours on Hard (I presume) to beat, but it was good nonetheless. You simply would expect more from a franchise with an assload of long, and sometimes, very challenging chapters. They didn't add anything new in this expansion (as in guns or creatures), but it's not a bad thing from a storyline standpoint, since the game takes place on Black Mesa, near the same sectors you're in when you play as Gordon in Half-Life. The only ""complaint"", I'd say, is that the game was very short. But I enjoyed it, seeing things through Calhoun's eyes (I love Barney, got a damn crush on him) was interesting, and some parts were very well made and well thought-out. Not going to spoil for those who want to play, but to those who have played it: Chapter 6, ""Power Struggle"". Dynamite detonator box. Barrel on a corner to your right. You played the game; you might understand.I recommend it, but only if you have played Half-Life. I doubt you'll enjoy it if you haven't played it. Quite the contrary, I think you'd find it dull. So buy it and play it if you want some more of Half-Life in the Black Mesa Facility.			"

												The shortest and least substantial expansion pack to the original Half-Life, Blue Shift puts you in the role of Barney Calhoun, a security officer at Black Mesa on the day of the Black Mesa incident. As with Opposing Force and Decay, this game was developed by Gearbox using assets from the original Half-Life. Blue Shift is by far the shortest of the four campaigns, beatable between 2.5-5 hours depending on the difficulty and your experience with first-person shooters.This game's initial presentation is very good, but its short traversal and occasionally awkward puzzles put a ""damper"" on things. There are lots of homages to things that happen in Half-Life, Decay, and Opposing Force. The first chapter is really immersive and is a pretty good setup for the rest of the campaign. Unfortunately, Calhoun is relegated to doing the most mundane stuff in the facility, and it really feels like his story is the least important of the four.****SPOILERS AHEAD****Because of the game's brevity, it has to compress things greatly, which sometimes works to the detriment of the game. The difficulty escalates much more quickly than in any of the other campaigns. The second chapter is probably the best, but figuring out what Gearbox was thinking with two of the puzzles (i.e., the weird machines you manipulate vertically and going down an obscured ladder to a completely different area) are hard for me to understand why they were chosen. The third chapter introduces marines and this is where things really get hairy. Unlike every other HL game in my experience, the marines in Blue Shift seem to spam the MP5's grenades the most. It feels artificially difficult because the grenades are very damaging and hard to see coming to dodge.Also in the third chapter, there is a bit of an escort mission, which is exceedingly annoying because the guy decides to stop following you because he says he's tired. Sometimes this happens after he says he'll follow you and not take a single step. Other times he'll just rush ahead of you, which is also annoying when he gets in harm's way. One of the funniest experiences I think most people have had with him is him saying he won't go another step when he's right in front of the security door that he's been ♥♥♥♥♥ing about getting to.Anyway, after that chapter, you get sent to the alien homeworld and there's a mess of convoluted mazes. This was also the chapter that I discovered Gearbox's proclivity for constantly placing headcrabs right around 90-degree corners in order for them to almost always get a hit on you just because you couldn't see it coming. I thought this was also pretty cheap. There might be multiple ways to get to the destination but I can foresee people getting confused and frustrated with the random organization of everything. Do you take the left path or the right path? It's a lot of trial and error, I think, and I guess I just got lucky. There's also a really annoying platforming section where you have to basically save on every platform. But once you get past that, there's a kind of extended waterfall section that actually feels like it could belong in the original Half-Life. It's certainly better than the factory in Interloper. This is also where you'll encounter almost all of the enemies that Gordon dealt with on Xen, except far, far fewer. After aligning the machinery on Xen, there's again a bit of a head-scratching moment to figure out where to go. You just jump on some crumbled rocks to reach an upper area, d!ck around for a bit (which feels unnecessary), and then find an arbitrary portal back home.The fifth chapter is the longest and in my opinion the most annoying. You have to find a power cell (battery) in a lower section of Black Mesa. Unfortunately things aren't as intuitive as they should be. For instance, you have to use a barrel as a conduit for a broken wire connected to some dynamite and an explosive lever. You also have to lower the coolant levels just to move some barrels, then raise the coolant levels to jump on the barrels to cross to the other side. But the worst offense (and this is the worst part of the entire game) is figuring out the one extremely random hidden button that raises a bridge to cross to a section you probably didn't even see. This is where the game's lack of explanation drove me batsh!t insane. Anyway, once you figure that all out, you charge the battery and send it back.The last chapter is pretty easy, you just have to open the damping fields to let the scientists through, then open them for yourself and go through. This is supposed to be tough because of the military guys, but if you know where they're coming from, you can plant a mine and take them out easily.This game isn't really all that long but it's decent for what it is. There are definitely some moments that are good but probably an equal number of moments that hit with a considerable clunk. It definitely doesn't have the gravitas of the other HL games and some of its puzzles are more annoying than anything. By far the aliens and military spawn point placement in Blue Shift feels the most d!ckish of all the games. But if you can handle those minor annoyances, it's fun to play. But if you're debating between this and Half-Life or Opposing Force, this should be the lowest on your list because it has the least content and feels less substantial (although Calhoun gets the best ending, in my opinion).P.S. I know it says I have only six minutes in the game. I beat it having ""changed game"" after having started Opposing Force.			"

It was interesting to see what this character saw what happened during the craziness of the incident. Anywho it was quick, short and sweet but a really cool side-story game!

												It seems that no matter how good a game series is, it's always destined to have a black sheep, so to speak. Sometimes the game isn't even bad, just not as solid as the rest and people act like by proxy it's the worst thing ever. It happened with Fallout 4 compared to Fallout 3 and New Vegas, and I feel like it happened with Half-Life: Blue Shift.Half-Life is the second and final expansion pack that Gearbox developed for the original Half-Life, and much like Opposing Force, Blue Shift puts you behind the perspective of another Character during the Black Mesa incident. In Blue Shift, you play as Barney Calhoun, a security guard and familiar face to those who've played Half-Life 2. Much like in Half-Life, Barney is starting his day of work at Black Mesa by commuting via tram, and after arriving at his scattered workplace, he gets his gun and presses a button for some rude as hell scientists in an elevator before everything goes FUBAR. As aliens begin teleporting in from Xen, Barney's elevator crashes into the ground, killing every occupant other than himself. Upon regaining conciousness, Barney sets off on a mission to escape Black Mesa, eventually meeting up with a Dr. Rosenberg, and the two partner up to escape the facility.One of the greatest criticisms leveled against Blue Shift is that unlike it's sister expansion, Blue Shift does not add in any new weapons or enemies, without even recycling the ones in Opposing Force. Barney also does not gain access to any of the neater weapons that Gordon Freeman was able to get his hands on like the Tau Cannon or the Hive-Hand, the biggest gun Barney is able to weild outside of console commands being the RPG. While these criticisms are certainly valid, it's not fair to say it doesn't bring anything new to the table. Blue Shift is decidedly much more story driven than Opposing Force, as Dr. Rosenberg is a very important character to Blue Shift's story and is one of the few persistant NPC's in the original trilogy. Dr. Rosenberg explains alot of exposition about his old lab in the facility wile also serving as one of the few charaters with the knowledge and equipment to actually escape the facility. As such, the latter half of the game consists of Barney doing various errands for Rosenberg to help calibrate his antiquated teleportation machines, such as going to set up a machine in the border world and restoring the backup power deep below the lab. Even though this may not seem all that important, it really does help Blue Shift feel like it's own experience, which is also accompanied by the game's unique handling of Armor. Barney is the only protagonist of the GoldSrc games who lacks a form of powered armor, so he must use the armor of his fallen comrades to protect himself. This can make the game feel really tense as armor becomes less of a second health bar and more of a finite resource which is found few and far between the last.That aside, I feel like the strongest point of Blue Shift is it's level design. The enemy placement and the size of the levels is pretty great, and the Xen levels are honestly really well made compared to the ones in Half-Life. While I'd say Opposing Force has the better gameplay of the two, I feel like Blue Shift's level design is much more consistant than OpFor's. Despite this, the other grave flaw with Blue Shift is it's shortness. Blue Shift seems to end just when it's beginning to get really good, and there's some puzzles in the game that don't make alot of sense initially, like the barrel and TNT puzzle.At the end of the day, Blue Shift may not be the best Half-Life game and may arguably be the weakest of the expansions, but it's still a Half-Life game, and it's still just a solid shooter in general. The persistant NPC's in the game as well as the level design and the armor tweaks make Blue Shift still a very positive experience overall, and if you liked Opposing Force or just Half-Life in general, you really should play Blue Shift. While less isn't necessarily more here, you can't really go wrong with a bite sized Half-Life.			"

												My personal favorite of the Half-Life Expansions.You play Barney the security guard, just going through your normal routines. Helping scientists with degrees in theoretical physics and years of experience push an Elevator button. Unfortunately for you, that button somehow ♥♥♥♥s everything up, and aliens invade Black Mesa, killing all. It's much shorter than the first, or even Opposing force, but in a way, it feels much more unique. Give it a try, I'm sure you'll be pleasantly surprised.			"

Though this is a 2001 game, I felt free to explore and roam which is a refreshing experience. The game doesn't hold you hand at all. It is easier than the original game. Still fun and I reccomend this highly to anyone who can live with older graphics, less hand holding, and minor bugs.			"

												Half-Life: Blue Shift is the second expansion pack to the original Half-Life. Much like Opposing Force, you play from the point of view of a Black Mesa security guard named Barney Calhoun. Once again, the events in this game run parallel to the original so it's fun to see Gordon Freeman around. This expansion is the much shorter than Opposing Force, however it's still fun even though there are no new weapons or enemies introduced. For Half-Life fans this expansion is great in offering more gameplay and rounding up the Half-Life 1 storyline.			"

												Having recently completed Half-Life Opposing Force, I cannot recommend Blue Shift. I only feel compelled to write this review because Blue Shift was so underwhelming compared to the original and the expansion. It has half as many weapons as either previous game but none of the new, charming weapons found in OF. Though it includes a few decent Half-Life style physics puzzles, boring and frustrating filler sections bury the good parts. To start with, there is just too much exposition comprised of unnecessary Easter eggs winking at the original or the expansion. For a 2.5 hour long game, the 20-30 minute exposition adds nothing by retracing the steps of the original. The expansion further wastes time with long NPC dialogue sections that consist mostly of pointless techno-babble which does nothing to flesh out or expand the Half-Life universe. The game also contains a needlessly long NPC escort portion chock full of pathing bugs. At the end of the game, the same NPC leads the player through another pointlessly long Simon-says segment with nothing to do but press a button every minute or so.When the action actually happens, the game frustrates by leading the player down long, maze-like corridors with headcrabs behind every box, rock, and corner. Fights with soldier-type enemies similarly become frustrating because the game throws so many at the player at once. Combined with their high ridiculously high health pool (a problem shared with the original), the player spends long stretches shooting at enemies who won't seem to die and who won't stop coming. By contrast, fights with alien enemies simply pit the player against easily dispatched pairs or triples of Vortigaunts or Houndeyes. The most difficult enemies are a few grunts. None of the new, difficult enemies introduced in OF appear.As a whole, the expansion plays more like a fan made bonus level relying exclusively on existing game assets. It lacks the polish and clever moments of the original and the sci-fi schlock charm of the OF expansion. The player learns nothing new about the Half-Life universe that the original had not already covered. As a whole, Blue Shift adds nothing to the Half-Life experience except for a few new short, frustrating levels. It might as well be skipped even if you picked it up as part of the anthology.			"

												A very short but scintillating expansion. I honestly don't know or don't care why the reviewers scolded this little, innocent expansion so much. It shows us that cute Barney is also a murdering machine which is great I say. The game introduced the Half-Life HD pack. It also has some pretty original puzzles, making the copy-paste Half-Life gameplay a little more sufferable, for the third time in a row. It can't compare with Opposing Force with originality though. It doesn't add new weapons, but it is as full of details as the previous two games. It also has a happy ending, without you being obligatorily captured by G-Man. It features a great character named Dr. Rosenberg that you will interact with and help him escape Black Mesa. Oh and you can see Gordon Freeman himself at least 3 times during the play. It's a must for any Half-Life fan, even though it's that short and not extremely inventive, gameplay and story-wise.			"

												Pretty simple review:Did you enjoy Half life 1 or wish to experience a little more of the Black Mesa universe?Give both expansions a go!Did you find Half Life 1 was a little too dated or lacking in action to finish?Probably give the expansions a miss. A couple puzzles may make you stop and give a quick think/back track for a while but other than it it will be 2-4 hours of the same sort of gameplay from a difference perspective.Personally Blue Shift play like a nice segment taken out of the middle of Half Life 1, more story than continual killing seen towards the Zen chapters.

												Another part of the Half-Life franchise, and the blue sheep (hue) of the series, Blue Shift is a small addon to the first game.You're put in the shoes of Barney Calhoun, AKA every security guard seen in HL1. He's really only relevant in HL2, let's be honest.It's a quick adventure, mostly comprising of an escort mission, a small trip to Xen, and a small trip to the basement. The puzzles were a bit confusing at first, but were overall fun. It didn't add any new weapons or enemies, but I can excuse this as there's a clear focus on the story elements. Overall: It was fun, albeit short. Get it on sale.8/10			"

												Half-Life: Blue Shift... I REALLY want to go in-depth with this game, people... but it's just too short to say much about it... so... I'll try...Blue Shift is another expansion pack for Half-Life 1. Much like it's predecassor, you take the view of Barney Calhoun, a security officer working in Black Mesa and a personal friend to Gordon Freeman. Here's the thing that probably many people wondered in their Christmas of 2001. Opening the game up from the box, popping it into their brand-new Windows XP computer, and watching the opening sequence, and noticing something different... the outstanding graphics for the time. Seriously, as far as I know, this game is only famous for two things, Barney appearing as a major character in Half-Life 2, 3 years later, and the graphics in this game for 2001, as Opposed, *ahem*, opposed to Opposing Force and the original Half-Life. If you had essentially the i7 type of computer of back then, and were one of the cool kids already with a GameCube, PS2, and original Xbox in your possesion, you were amazed with the visuals of Blue Shift. But, I'm sorry to say... that's really is almost the only reason this game is... well... was known. The story is about as basic as it can get.Barney Calhoun is doing duty as a security officer in the Black Mesa Research Facility and going down an elevator when, shock, the facility experiences a Resonance Cascade caused by Gordon Freeman submitting a Xen(ian) crystal in a test chamber for analysis, causing confused alien species to enter Black Mesa and vaporise all the remaining employees at every turn (satisfying) and your goal is to, you guessed it, escape the facility with the few surviving scientists guiding your way to a possible exit, while killing all the aliens that you can kill. Eventually, though, Barney is able to teleport himself at the surface of the facility, along with Dr. Rosenberg,  shortly after witnessing a montage of the events Gordon Freeman faced. He supposedly drives away along with a few scientists in an SUV to safety, away from Black Mesa.Pros: Graphics and animations were innovative for the time. The game also served as the basis for Barney's purpose in the next Half-Life game, Half-Life 2, and did it fairly well.Cons: Game felt EXTREMELY short and, personally, I just didn't find Dr. Rosenberg very interesting. Only took me about 2 hours to beat, and 4 more just to TRY Hard difficulty and to see if it made a difference, but just felt like the first Half-Life game on Normal. Speaking of which... the Easy mode of Half-Life: Blue Shift is just about the most boring excuse of a Half-Life game I've ever seen. I'm sorry, but I don't find the constant, constant, CONSTANT health packs, ammo, suit health, and health machines ALL over the friggin place to be like a Half-Life game. To be honest, HARD mode seems to have this down... it makes the health packs, etc. give you LESS health, suit health, etc. But in Easy mode... I think I had a harder time playing the 2nd stage of Portal 1. Also... no G-Man.Overall, it's a passable Half-Life game. It still has the dark humor as the other titles, and the story, while short, still felt like a good distraction from time to time. Only play Blue Shift if you're EXTRA curious about the story of Barney Calhoun. Wanna know how short the game is? Writing this review took longer than the game itself, lol.7.0/10			"

It happens in-sync with the original games time. Opposing Force happens later in the event, making this and the original come first.

												Half-Life: Blue Shift is an expansion pack for Half-Life and was made by Gearbox. You are playing as security officer Barney Calhoun in Black Mesa when♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan. While Opposing Force brought new content to the franchise, Blue Shift didn't, really. + Background story for Barney Calhoun+ Half-Life fans might want to play it at least once.+ Health packs+ More Half-Life to see- Rather short- Doesn't add much to the Half-Life universe- It stops abruptly- Less interesting puzzles than Opposing Force's- No subtitlesI'd recommend buying Half-Life: Blue Shift if you are a die-hard Half-Life fan and can't get enough. Keep in mind though that Opposing Force is superior to Blue Shift in every way. Since Blue Shift is such a short experience, I would recommend getting it on a sale.If you are not a Half-Life fan, but like FPS don't get this game. It's an average game and there are better and longer alternatives to this.Replay value: AverageRating: 6.5/10Recommendation: Yes if you are a Half-Life fan. Otherwise stay away			"

												Blue Shift is the second and last Half-Life expansions.  This puts you in Barney's, the police officer, shoes.  Again, same as with Opposing Force you are caught in the same storyline as Gordon Freeman from the original Half-Life.  You will see Gordon Freeman once or twice, to help you get your bearings on where you are within the timeline of the original game, similar to Opposing Forces.  This game is short, simple and doesn't add much more to the original game or the first expansion.  The storyline is mediocre at best, but since this is a Half-Life game, I must recommend.  Just know that if you're not a fan of Half-Life, this game will not be the entertainment that you are looking for that the other Half-Life games will offer.			"

You go by your day to day life of killing military personnel with weapons that range from a Spaz 12 shotgun to a Bertette Pistol to a Crowbar, helping scientists escape when they really just want to walk a couple steps and give up because they don't like the sun, Go to a parralel dimension and see floating♥♥♥♥♥♥to activate a teleporter with no purpose, follow Gorgeous Freeman as he tries to escape White Mesa and shooting aliens with guns no security guard would have. It provides us with story leading up to Half Loaf 2,  as Barney escapes with some nerds to a City of 17 or something.  If I could say anything, it would be that Barney Calzone is a delicious security guard.			"

												Half Life: Blue Shift, like Half Life: Opposing Force, is another perspective to the Black Mesa Incident where you play as a security guard for Black Mesa who's name is Barney Calhoun.The game is really, really short. My playthrough was about 3 hours but I guess it makes sense since this game was originally an expansion. It has good level design but I'm disappointed that it didn't introduce new weapons like Opposing Force did, or even have any of the new weapons from Opposing Force. Also it didn't have any of the Race X aliens.  Another thing I was disappointed about was that there wasn't a G-Man ending but I guess G-Man isn't going to be interested with everyone.	I'd give this game a nice 8/10 even if it was a bit too short.			"

												Well I remember playing Half-Life: Blue Shift when I was very young (I started gaming when I was 5 or 6 years old). I use to watch my Dad play Half-Life, Doom, and Quake. Blue Shift is a great expansion to Half-Life and adds some really good, enjoyable content. You need to play this. 10/10.			"

Half-Life: Blue ShiftThis is the second expansion pack for one of the best games ever made:Half-Life. In this expansion pack you play as Barney Calhoun, a Black Mesa security guard. After a scientific mishap causes Black Mesa to be invaded by aliens, Calhoun must fight his way to safety.Graphics: The graphics to this game aren't that good. They used to be worse, but they were improved by the High Definiton texture pack.Story: Although Blue Shift is a really short game the story isn't bad. It takes place in Black Mesa but some parts of the game are on another planet. Calhoun must help Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues to escape from Black Mesa.Gameplay: The gameplay is really similar to Half-Life.Calhoun battles through the game alone, but is occasionally assisted by friendly NPC's. Some aliens like headcrabs and vortigaunts return from the original game. PRO'S: Gameplay, MusicCON'S: Really short(6/10)[/b] "

 Half Life: Blue Shift What is it?Blue shift is a standalone mod for Half life 1, or the gold source engine so to speak, that is based around the original half life series. During the game, you play as a security guard, working yet another day at black mesa. But this day is'nt the same as any other. Scientists find a way to another dimension, and where are you when it all happens? In the elevator, like a chum.All of the aspects of Half life, thrown into a smaller and shorter story.  I loved it It may be short, but there are a few puzzles that make you run around a bit, even though the answer was right in front of your face the entire time. Alteast that was the case for me. As I played, I made my own way of what weapons to use against what enemies. How to take them down and so forth. If you know how to B-Hop, then the movement will go a lot quicker. If you dont? Get a script, it will really help with the movement in this game. It honestly would have taken me an extra half hour not b-hopping to finish it.But in all reality, a very good classic. Glad I bought it again on steam. Played the mod when it came out, and now I have the memory attatched forever.Thanks a lot ValvePs: I could tottally get a refund for this game, and then get opposing force instead. 2 for 1 really. But I support you, so I will buy Opposing force and play that too!			"

Liked it better than the base game as well as Opposing Force. Super fun stuff. Still no HL2 though.			"

												Blue Shift, the 2nd of the three Gearbox expansions for Half-Life, re-tells the story of the Black Mesa Incident from Barney Calhoun's perspective. While undeniably short it stays true to the original Half-Life, in my opinion far closer than Opposing Force and Decay, as such if you enjoyed Half-Life you'll likely enjoy Blue Shift. I'd also like a moment to address those calling this lazy. Specifically complaints about lack of added content. Turn your attention to the High Definition Pack, which initially came with Blue Shift (now implemented in all HL steam releases) which added the option for HD models (found within settings) for each of the PC Half-Life games. Various changes were included, most notably increased polygon count on both character and weapon models. You can read more about this here.[half-life.wikia.com] "

What I liked about the game•	Half-life blue shift is short, but sweet. With good level design, there are many secret ammunition stashes to be found and there are many puzzles to solve. •	Not too challenging like opposing force, which makes a more enjoyable experience. •	It’s great to be playing as another character from Black Mesa, seeing his perspective, seeing what events uncover for him and how he escapes from Black Mesa.•	Another brilliant ending.What I disliked or was disappointed with •	No new content( no new enemies, no new weapons and no bosses) •	The game is short, took me less than 3hours to complete. •	The puzzles aren’t as good in blue shift, compared to half-life and opposing force.  Conclusion A very good expansion pack for half-life. I preferred it over opposing force, because the gameplay was much more enjoyable and not too difficult. If you enjoyed half-life and opposing force, I highly recommend you play this. 80/100       "

												Not good at writing reviews but I'll try my best to cover everything :)But before we continue I advise you to play the original Half-Life (Read my review for Half-Life  Here  ) Review Half-Life: Blue Shift (HL:BS) is an expansion pack for Valve's FPS game Half-Life The Gameplay doesn't differ much from the original gameYou play the role of Barney Calhoun a security guard for Black Mesa facility,the game takes place in the same universe as the original Half-Life your obejctive is to evacuate the scientists trapped inside black mesa and escape the with them but things change quickly as you encounter aliens and the commando group affiliated with US government known as the  Black Ops  . I don't want to spoil the story anymore play this game and discover for yourself ;)Let's jump to pros and consPros:+Extremely Challenging+Hard to beat the enemies (even on easy difficulty)+Variety of weapons (About 14-15)+Amazing Graphics (For a video game that was developed in 2001)+Nice Gameplay+The game is challenging you won't be able to beat this game easily in Short It's not your average run and shoot game instead of hunting down waves after waves of enemies there are a lot of puzzles in the game you have to solve in order to proceed to next level only intelligent people are able to do so (Seriously)+Great soundtracks+Physics is perfect (almost)+Maps are very detailed (for a game developed in GoldSrc Engine)+Hard to beat enemies+Great Environment (The feeling of being alone and surrounded by enemies from all sides)+Mod SupportCons:-Extremely Buggy (It was difficult to complete the game I had to keep loading the same save file over and over again at some levels for example:-sometimes a door won't open,npcs wont respond,buttons wont work but loading the save file again would solve the problem xD)-A VERY SHORT storyOverall Rating:-7.5/10Although I did enjoy this game but due its short story I recommend you to buy it during the sale it doesn't deserve $5			"

												Recommended for completionists or those who didn't get their fill from Half-Life 1 and Opposing Force. The shortest of all 3 games and the least exciting: the protagonist Barney Calhoun's primary goal is to escape Black Mesa rather than pursue an antagonist, leading to a somewhat disappointing finale. Made 20% more enjoyable when experienced alongside the very excellent walkthrough by BigMacDavis.- Skinny from the Fat B*stard (curator link) "

												As the Sega port of Half-Life was dropped, it's remains were scalvaged for the PC owners who might otherwise benefit. The result? Half-Life: Blue Shift. Although Blue Shift plays like a fairly average mission pack, it is infact a stand-alone release, not needing the original Half-Life to play. Even so, it is only a couple of hours long in length and doesn't deliver much new content. There is included a HD pack which benefits players of Half-Life in general with more detailed character and object models however it's fairly glitchy, especially on the Half-Life mods. Yet Blue Shift does atleast give some fitting closure to Barney, that guy who owed us a beer in Black Mesa, while going into a little more depth into how the science team escaped following the Resonance Cascade. It is doubtful if the plot can still be called canon by this point, but it is still nice to experience Blue Shift even so. Give it a try.			"

												Blue Shift is an Add-on for Half-Life 1, in which instead of Gordon, you take control of Barney, who in this game is only referenced to as Calhoon, or B. Calhoon. The game is rather short compared to Half-Life 1 (Obviously) and even shorter than the first Add-on, Opposing Force. With my skills, I completed the game in a total of 3 hours, over the course of several days (I think about 2.) Of course due to it's age, the graphics are sub-par compared to todays games, but I know where amazing at the time. It can be a bit glitchy however. Sometimes you will get trapped in walls or obstacles, or certain things will get stuck on walls, such as the transport tram. However these glitches are few and far in-between, so you needn't worry. One thing to note though is that the auto-save feature sometimes takes long gaps between checkpoint saves. It isn't really like Half-Life 2, where it saves right before a big fight, or in the middle of a long fight, so I recommend you save often or you MIGHT find yourself playing the same large section over and over again. But for all it's worth, Blue Shift is worth the money just for the charm of playing as Barney/A Mesa Security Guard (Despite him never speaking), and I believe if you have some spare cash, give it a try.

												I can’t seem to find any new games to play. I see I am left with only one choice, go outside. Ha, not bloody likely. I guess I’ll continue with the retro shooters scene. Blue Shift dynamically changed Half Life by making you play as neither the jocks nor the nerds but the would-be of both groups, the security guards; a prospect that made me shake in my booties. Oh and would you look at that, another double name that refers to both the character and a scientific term. Oh Valve, you unscrupulous little geeks. It’s like next you’ll follow up with a console exclusive called “Half Life: Decay” which had a focus multiplayer. What a sick twisted world that would be, huh. Then again, we don’t speak of the dark times to come. (Cough) AC: Unity (cough).On the surface the game is about an alien invasion, but deep down you see a much more compelling story. The story of Barney the mute security guard who recovers from his lack of speech as is seen in Half Life 2; hint hint upcoming piece (cough) hint. Blue Shift was the shortest by far, but it brought with it updated textures for the graphics junkies for which I have no respect, and yet I have no disrespect. In other words don’t talk to me and we’ll be just fine. This game is marginally more open than the previous titles and I found myself breaking down a wall to a much later part of the game earlier, so there’s that. A concept Eric Hirshberg is still trying to figure out. This piece was made with a tad less effort, yes. Thanks for asking, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												Blue Shift is another continuation of the original Half Life games. This time you assume the role of security guard Barney Calhoun, during the events of the original game. Just like the original game and Opposing Force, your main objective is to survive by assisting fellow Black Mesa Employees, using any weapon or tool to your advantage and by using your wits. Blue shift does just that.Gameplay wise, It's still the engaging Half Life everyone knows and loves. Real Time cutscenes? Check. Aggresive and sophisticated enemies? Check. Reliable friendly NPC's? Check. Clever puzzles and well designed levels? Check. And the epic and intense gunplay that the original had? Yep, it's all here. Graphically, it's just like the previous games. The levels look as varied as ever, and the audio still breaths a great atmosphere into the game. So far, everything that is included in this expansion is good.But it's the worst installment in the series.And why, do you ask? Because, unlike it's predecessors, it's really short. Really, really short. And unlike Opposing Force, it didn't really add anything new. OK, maybe the HEV battery pickups have now been replaced by Body armour since you are a security guard instead of a heavily armoured scientist/soldier. But... other than that... that's it. No new guns, no new NPC types, friendly or enemy, no new level obstacles and gimmicks, no nothing. Hell, it even lacks some things from the original Half Life, such as certain weapons and an end boss. With an impressive expansion like Opposing force being released before this, I was honestly expecting to see a lot more, but instead, it feels like a watered down Half Life. It's still nice, but it could've been so much more.Overall, Half Life: Blue Shift is a fairly decent expansion, although a tad bit underwhelming considering the content it's two predecessors delivered before it. If you enjoyed Half Life or Opposing Force, I'd say you check Blue Shift out. If you never played either of those two, this is not the best place to start. It's way too short and light on content and the other Half Life games deliver so much more. Get those instead, then buy this during a sale.			"

												For my opinion on Half-Life as a whole and it's expansions, go and read my Half-Life or even my Opposing Force review so that I don't have to repeat it here. It was Game of the Year back then for a reason and to me it will ALWAYS be one of the all-time greats in gaming. I don't feel that there is a bad extension to Half-Life, the vast multiplayer extensions and Opposing Force, and yes, even Blue Shift are worth their weight in gold. Blue Shift has received quite a bit of flack from the gaming community and the Half-Life fan base, and I can understand why it's not as popular as Half-Life itself or Opposing Force, but it really isn't deserving of a lot of the criticism it receives. The only real fault with the game is that it is incredibly short, so I don't feel it's worth it's full retail price, best to pick it up for cheap during a sale, but I still think it's a must-have for any Half-Life fan. This small expansion requires you to think before you make an action and to use your ammunition/armour wisely.It is questionable as to whether this game is canon to the entire series, some say yes and some say no, but that doesn't really matter, the point is that it is another way to experience Half-Life through a different perspective, that of a Black Mesa Security Guard - Barny Calhoun. As already mentioned, the game is short, VERY short, so you won't be playing for long, but it is still fun. There are no new weapons or enemies, I'm afraid, but if you have ever played Decay, this is a great storyline to experience as it goes along with that story extremely well (again, Valve proves their story-telling genius).I don't really have much else to say, so to sum it up in a few words: This game is, in my opinion, worth getting despite the flack it has received, but not at it's full retail price (unless you're loaded). You can not have Half-Life without Opposing Force and Blue Shift. Just remember - It's short and you won't be in-game for long, so don't be disappointed when you reach the end much sooner than you may think.			"

												Were it not for a few tedious obstacles towards the end of the game (a puzzle with an obtuse solution to the exclusion of a dozen valid alternatives immediately on hand, and the game's first and only instant-death pool outside of Opposing Force), I would call Blue Shift a head-and-shoulders improvement over the core game.If I had to name three downsides to HL1, an otherwise excellent game and undeniable classic, it's that it drags on for far too  long; late-game weapons tend to get very gimmicky; and your personal motivation is never really more concrete than ""move forward and don't get killed"" until you reach Xen, where it becomes ""find the final boss and kill it so you can stop playing already.""Blue Shift solves all these problems. It's a good deal shorter than the core game, especially highlighted by a scene at the very end that shows that the story wraps up long before Freeman finishes his side of things. Its weapon selection is much tighter, with nothing really left as a useless gimmick - like the core game's Alien Bee Launcher, which pretty much served solely as a last-ditch weapon when you were out of ammo in everything else - or basically anything that runs on what I've come to call ""Science Ammo."" And finally, without getting in your way the plot is much more directed, providing you with actual motive to move from Point A to Point B besides ""because there's no other direction to move in.""

												Remember how the final chapter of Opposing Force seemed kinda rushed? This time the whole expansion seems rushed and unfinished. Don't get me wrong, the game is enjoyable, but sadly short. Another disappointment would be lack of new enemies or weapons, considering that previous expansion (Opposing Force) had both. Unfortunately, what both expansions have in common are annoying glitches. Still, the game delivers a nice story, with each chapter detailed so well. There's also a bunch of cool easter eggs and references, which is always a good thing. So if you liked previous games, then you should play Blue Shift as well. Just don't expect it to be as big as Opposing Force was.Pros:+ Good story with a nice ending+ Interesting easter eggs, references, cameosCons:- Lack of new content- Various glitches- Too short7/10			"

												Blue Shift is like the poor relation in the universe of Half-Life. While it's not a BAD game, it defintely doesn't stack up to the awesomeness of Half-Life.If you've played Half-Life and Opposing Force, you might as well play Blue Shift just to finish the book. But be forewarned that the game is not as well designed as the other two.  But if you want one last trip to the Black Mesa facility, here it is.			"

												I have loved the Half-Life series for years now, to which the Black Mesa parking pass on my car and the Gordon Freeman figure on my desk will attest. But for some reason, I'd never gotten around to playing Blue Shift -- I knew the story, but I'd never fired up the game itself. Feeling nostalgic, I thought I'd give it a go.I can see now why it has a reputation as the weakest entry in the series. The puzzles are a bit tedious, and Xen is as much of a slog as ever. While you do get a glimpse of the G-Man and Dr. Freeman, there's never that sense of mystery that the other games have. If you are a completionist and fan of the Half-Life games, by all means play it (it's short, and just over three hours or so), but there's nothing in either the gameplay or story to really draw you in.

												Half-Life was one of the first FPS to propose a complex story, with graphics still angular but with the best 3D for 1998. You were Gordon Freeman, a scientist turned hero for the Black Mesa staff, in a place where an alien invasion was happening, where Marines and Black Ops were the ""cleaners"". G-Man, mysterious man with a case, was monitoring you.The game was a real success and an add-on was released in 1999. Opposing Force was shorter than HL (normal for an add-on) but with the return of the G-Man, with new weapons, new enemies. One big difference: you weren't Gordon. No, you were Adrian Shepard, corporal in the HECU, belonging to the famous Marines who were adversaries in HL. You were a Marine now but fortunately, you changed your mind: no more scientists or guards killings, as you can suppose that they'll be an useful help.HL, HLOF and Blueshift are the three main games of what we can call, now that that Half-Life 2 and Co. are released, the Black Mesa Era. So what is about Blueshift?The Black Mesa Era is special because of the multiple points of view you can play. Gordon was the scientist side, Adrian the military one, so, it was missing the guard one.Many can argue that we could have played a Black Ops, a Xenian (the mod Point of View is taking the matter in its hand), the woman that was pushing the crystal (the exclusive mission on PS2, Decay, is taking the matter in its hand, as the mod Decay, a port for PC of this mission) or anything else (a janitor - well, a mod is existing, an external person - the mod Half-Life Visitors is... oh well, you know what I mean). But Gearbox choose what was called Barney, the guards of Black Mesa, taking that name for making an hero. It could have been Otis, it would have been really funny to be healed by donuts.So, you're returning into Black Mesa Hell. You're Barney Calhoun, a guard, beginning your adventure before the incident triggered by Gordon. Then, eventually, you will have to fight your way in a chaotic facily, trying to escape, finding a certain Rosenberg and... well, it's not a spoiler, Barney did escape Black Mesa, like Gordon and Adrian, apart from the fact that he was still free.I need to say something: it's a stand-alone, where a lot of gamers tended to call it an add-on.Story is basic, hell, it's just another day in Black Mesa, so don't expect something different. See the community mod for it. But Gearbox did a crime, an offense in the Half-Life Mythology.G-Man is appearing once. What? Half-Life 2 Episode One did the same? Hey, the story was about saving Gordon from him. But G-Man did come back in the next chapter, still following Gordon.G-Man was interested in Gordon and Adrian. But not in Barney Calhoun, who is in the Combine Era one of the most famous Resistance leader. G-Man was involved with Eli and Alyx Vance's story. Why not with Barney, who is one of the few that were really struggling. Where is my fun to spot G-Man?Gameplay hadn't change a bit and I don't complain about that: it's Half-Life, I mean, you have to climb ladders, find a way to kill enemies when your weapons aren't sufficient, you have to be careful when nearing toxic areas and when you're jumping on Xen...The game had a big bug, meaning that you're obliged to download a patch: Flashlight wasn't working. Other negative point is that you can't use the HEV device for protection... in total contradiction with Adrian Shepard, not belonging to Black Mesa, who can use it! Also, BlueShift didn't solve the problems of these dangerous ladders when it comes to climb down.Graphics are still the same if you don't install the High Definition Pack. If you do so, the HDP is making the characters less angular, your environment is less sterile and a new skin is given to your weapons. Anyway, Blue Shift's graphics are good if you're not allergic to ""old"" engines.With an established universe like Half-Life, Blue Shift couldn't forget to make some references to the two previous games: you see Gordon in his tramway when you're trying to enter to your department for work (a scene present in the original Half-Life) or just before he's entering in it. You're seeing him in the Sector C, walking to his destiny, you're seeing the famous crystal that will triggered the portals being carried to its final destination and last but not least, the professor you're rescuing is thinking that Gordon will not solve things, that it's a foolish idea to believe in him. Oh, have I mentioned that the last you'll be seeing Gordon is when he's captured by the Marines? Next time, it would be years later, in City 17 train station. Well, Blue Shift is taking place at the same time of the first part of Gordon's story, so, it's normal to have a lot of references to Half-Life. For Opposing Force, the only mention of Adrian Shepard is made by a Marine when throwing Otis, the fat guard, in a pit you're climbing.Blueshift is really lacking of novelties. It isn't bringing something new besides the story. Barney only uses Half-Life's weapons (no Opposing Force did make it) and worst of it, he has less than Gordon. No more experimental weapon, no more crossbow. Then, the enemies are reduced to what Gordon encountered (less the giant boss like Gargantua), so, no Race X from Opposing Force. And last but not the least (for me), soundtrack is good but isn't renewed like in Opposing Force. No new tunes, no new sounds, well, it's kind of frustrating for me who loves soundtrack, particularly when a game set in an universe has a different music than the others.Finally, Blue Shift, for a stand-alone, is shorter than the add-on Opposing Force... who was shorter than Half-Life. Five hours of playing (and more if your flashing is buggy) isn't enough for Half-Life. Well, the episodic games set in HL2 universe are as short as Blue Shift but the content is more extended than Blue Shift's. Here, we're in 2001, players were waiting for HL2 and well, they're in the right to expect much more for HL. It was like the game was rushed for giving something to impatient fans.			"

												Well, that was shorter than I expected.Half-Life: Blue Shift follows the original Half-Life expansion pack formula, by telling the same story of Black Mesa through a different pair of eyes. And, to be completely honest, I like this take on the Black Mesa incident more than Opposing Force. This time it's not about aliens or taking over the facility as Gordon or Shepard. You're stuck right in the middle as a security guard who's natural impulse is to just get the f*** out of there. There's no G-man (save for a brief cameo), no high stakes, just aliens, marines, and getting the f*** out of Black Mesa. The story is tight enough for the little developments to come when they do and it's has enough investment that by the end you're on the edge of your seat waiting for what's about to happen. In that regard, I think Blue Shift is a more effective story than Opposing Force.That being said though, Blue Shift is a bit lower on the gameplay end. Some puzzles are pretty easy, while some are very oddly designed (like pushing a barrel into a TNT line to blow up a door, even though that was never introduced as a concept in the game before), and there's no addition to the weapon line-up like Opposing Force had. You have almost all the same guns as the original Half-Life and you cover a lot less area in Black Mesa than the previous two installments.However, everything I love about Half-Life is still here, it's just more condensed. I'd consider Blue Shift the cliffnotes version of the Half-Life story. It's short, sweet, and over in about 3 hours. Is it as grand as Half-Life? No. Is it as expansive as Opposing Force? No. But is it still enjoyable? Yeah, I think so. I enjoyed the 3 hours I spent in Blue Shift. It might not be for everyone else, but I still think it's a fine expansion pack to a fine game. I'm giving Half-Life: Blue Shift an 8/10.			"

												Blue Shift is the second PC expansion for the Half-Life games. Originally, Blue Shift was meant to be an add-on for the Dreamcast version of Half-Life, much like Half-Life: Decay was an add-on for the PlayStation 2 version of Half-Life. (Which you can now play as a mod for the original Half-Life: moddb)The fact that Blue Shift was originally just an add-on which became an expansion later on is really visible when looking at the time it takes to finish it. Opposing Force took me 6.6 hours to complete on normal, while Blue Shift took me 2.5 hours. In my opinion, Blue Shift is also too easy with too many health crates laying everywhere. What also makes visible that it was originally just an add-on is that you get no new weapons, and you only get to use the non-alien weapons of the original Half-Life. Even though this expansion of the Half-Life universe is maybe lesser in content. I still enjoyed it. It is short which makes it get to the action directly. Also, you go to the alien dimension more often in this one. The gameplay in this expansion is mostly just shooting and not really any puzzle solving. The game also doesn't have any boss fights. Everything is mostly combat oriented. With some more parts in the alien dimension. This expansion takes place at the same time as the previous Half-Life games with references to the previous expansion and the original game. The only difference this time is that you experience the story from the perspective of a security guard. Throughout the story, you can really see the style of Gearbox once again with adding a lot of humor in it. What I think is funny to mention is that one of the characters is voice acted by the voice actor of Duke Nukem. Years later, Gearbox went on to create Duke Nukem Forever. With Blue Shift I encountered some bugs. One was that every time I loaded a checkpoint the game acted as if I was  holding the mouse button. So when I spawned the weapon just kept shooting. It was fun to play Half-Life again from a different point of view. but in my opinion the expansions like this or Opposing Force don't really add too much to the story. Still, this expansion pack has some nice action during the short time of playing.Reviews of the other Half-Life games:Half-LifeHalf-Life: Opposing ForceHalf-Life 2 "

The story in this game is about escaping black mesa with 2 more scientists, it enlightens u on how barney calhoun escaped from black mesa with the scientist that u encounter in the beginning of half life 2+ Its half life :P+ Adds new elements to the storyline+ has the same addictive gameplay - U only got like half the weapons than u have in the other half life games and there aren't any new- I found this expansion a little too short in comparison with opposing force I recommend u buy this when its on sale cause of the playtime but if u love half life 4,99 bucks isnt expensive and it has replay value.

This is a Spoiler Free Review! This review will contain informations and my personal opinion about this game.Half-Life: Blue Shift is an expansion pack for Valve Software's first-person shooter video game Half-Life. The game was developed by Gearbox Software with Valve Corporation and published by Sierra Entertainment on June 12, 2001. Blue Shift is the second expansion for Half-Life, Opposing Force beeing the first one. As with Gearbox's previous expansion pack Opposing Force, Blue Shift returns to the setting and events of the original game, but portrays the story through the eyes of another person. The protagonist in Blue Shift is a security guard, Barney Calhoun, employed by the Black Mesa Research Facility. After a scientific mishap causes Black Mesa to be invaded by aliens, Calhoun must fight his way to safety. The gameplay and graphics are the same as the original one. There are no new and memorable characters except one scientist, that I won't spoil anything about him. The game is very short, in fact, it's even shorter than Opposing Force, taking about 5 hours to complete. Many people criticize Blue Shift because it doesn't feature almost nothing new compared to the original Half-Life but I don't mind. Barney Calhoun is the one of the very few people who managed to do their goal during the Resonance Cascade. Out of all three playable characters in Half-Life, Barney was luckier and faced less danger, but out of all of them, he faced the most headcrabs. Overall, Half-Life: Blue Shift is very simillar to Opposing Force: short and fun. It's a must get for any HL fans and recommend this one for any casual player after finishing the original HL.PERSONAL RATE: 9/10			"

												It's a good addition to Half-Life. It's rather short, so it's not much good on it's own. But if you have Half-Life already, it's a good expansion of it. I wish it was longer, but it is interesting to see the Black Mesa Incident from another person's POV. Bottom line, if you have and like Half-Life, get this. If not, then don't bother.			"

												This Half-Life addition sees you playing as a Black Mesa facility security guard, Barney Calhoun, as you experience his trials and tribulations to escape the perils of ""the incident"" which occurred in Half-Life.  Blue Shift scraps many superfluous weapons from the first game, settling on a modest but satisfactory arsenal. Its storyline, the events that occur and the spectacular sights, along with some quite satisfying puzzles, will keep you entertained the whole way through; that said, it's not very long, as the duration of the game only spans a somewhat 'measly' 6 chapters, so it barely even has enough time to wear out its welcome. However, several high plot points and subtle (or not) details that serve to further intertwine its story's timeline with that of Gordon Freeman himself make the game wonderfully memorable and worth playing, especially if you've played Half-Life first.  Simplified, short, and pretty dang fun, Half-Life: Blue Shift isn't quite that full of a game in its own right, but it seems ""just right"", with a reasonable arsenal, and a far more manageable length than the first.  Considering it's more of a sister story to the first game, I might even say it serves this function--and then some.  A short but sweet and enjoyable ride.  A memorable experience, it's worth checking out Half-Life: Blue Shift.			"

												Half-Life: Blue Shift is the last standalone expansion for Half-Life and the last game to take place at Black Mesa. (Decay doesn't count and Black Mesa is a remake of the original Half-Life) You play as Barney Calhoun, a security guard who is trying to survive the events of Black Mesa (See Half-Life & HL: Opposing Force). Personally, I find this game the weakest of all the Half-Life games.Pros:-Great to introduce Barney Calhoun as you'll meet him later in Half-Life 2-Same pros as Half-Life (Great gameplay, great level detail, etc.)Cons:-Same weapons used by the great Gordon Freeman (Crowbar and everything) no new weapons like Opposing Force-Relatively boring story-Rarely any new enemies unlike Opposing Force-No Half-Life 3Overall, this game is OK its not the best Half-Life game. (7.5/10) I recommend this game if your a BIG Half-Life fan, or you want to learn more about Barney before the events of Half-Life 2. However, there is really nothing else to it. I felt that Gearbox could've done a better job with this expansion (See my review of Opposing Force to see what Gearbox can really do).			"

												Blue Shift has you in the shoes of Barny Calhoun, it gives you more backstory to the events of the Black Mesa Research Facility , main flaws are that its too short 4-6 hours and your done , it doesnt add any new content , AI is dumb enought not to recognise you even if your close but this didn't happen in Half Life,and most importantly it persist on intercation with a scientist wih kind of makes you feel unimportant it takes away from your shine. My main problem was 20 minues into the game I took an elevator with 2 scientists and the game glitchs making the elevator function as a fall and they both take fall damage and die... which make the game unplayable without the Blue Shift Unlocked Mod which is a shame.to download the use the mod you'll need both the original Half Life and Blue Shift.The only thing I see which was diffrent was the animations which made the game more immersive.But would I recommend this game no unless you want to get involved with the Half Life universe.

												This game is not only fun to play, but it is typical Valve masterpiece. The gameplay is easy to get used to and the events and story add up to the main story of the Half-Life franchise itself. You assume the role of Barney Calhoun, one of the main characters from Half-Life 2, and you experience the hardships he had to go through to get out of the Black Mesa Research Facility. The game is not as long as the original Half-Life, but considering the fact that it is an addon, the game is doing just fine.   I enjoyed every second of the game and especially mowing down those pesky boxes and crates. I give the game a 7 out of 10!			"

This is a Spoiler Free Review! This review will contain informations and my personal opinion about this game.Half-Life: Blue Shift is an expansion pack for Valve Software's first-person shooter video game Half-Life. The game was developed by Gearbox Software with Valve Corporation and published by Sierra Entertainment on June 12, 2001. Blue Shift is the second expansion for Half-Life, Opposing Force beeing the first one. As with Gearbox's previous expansion pack Opposing Force, Blue Shift returns to the setting and events of the original game, but portrays the story through the eyes of another person. The protagonist in Blue Shift is a security guard, Barney Calhoun, employed by the Black Mesa Research Facility. After a scientific mishap causes Black Mesa to be invaded by aliens, Calhoun must fight his way to safety. The gameplay and graphics are the same as the original one. There are no new and memorable characters except one scientist, that I won't spoil anything about him. The game is very short, in fact, it's even shorter than Opposing Force, taking about 5 hours to complete. Many people criticize Blue Shift because it doesn't feature almost nothing new compared to the original Half-Life but I don't mind. Barney Calhoun is the one of the very few people who managed to do their goal during the Resonance Cascade. Out of all three playable characters in Half-Life, Barney was luckier and faced less danger, but out of all of them, he faced the most headcrabs. Overall, Half-Life: Blue Shift is very simillar to Opposing Force: short and fun. It's a must get for any HL fans and recommend this one for any casual player after finishing the original HL.PERSONAL RATE: 9/10			"

Pros+Still looks and feels like a Half-Life game/story.+You finally find out which random security guard is Barney Calhoun. And it would seem that it was none of the Half-Life guards!+Overloaded with easter eggs, especially near the beginning.+HEV chargers are still operational despite the fact that you can't use them. I just found that amusing.Cons-Has some really outlandish puzzles, even more-so than certain Valve puzzles could be. How was I supposed to know that pushing a barrel over two broken wires equals MAKING THE DYNAMITE EXPLODE?-Easily the shortest entry in the Half-Life series, even shorter than Half-Life 2: Episode 1 (and I play games at a snail's pace).-Not much new content in general when compared to Opposing Force. No new weapons, enemies, etc. I mean, there's a new character, so I guess that's something...-The closest you get to a final boss is making sure the teleporter doesn't explode or whatever.-There's a REALLY annoying bug where, if you die and respawn by clicking one of the mouse buttons, your weapon will constantly fire off until you click the mouse button again. I'm not sure if there's a fix for this or even if it's just me, but just be wary of that.ConclusionOut of all of the entries in the Half-Life franchise, this is probably the least impactful. In fact, I'm willing to bet there have been mods for Half-Life that both continue the story in its own way and left more of an impact to the player. That being said though, this expansion isn't bad by any means. Just not quite as good as other games in the series.If you want this game, I'd recommend buying one of the Half-Life complete packs if you don't have a large number of the other entries. You'll get the other entries and save money overall in the process.Score rating: 7/10			"

												É bom como o Half-Life original e a expansão Opposing Force, mas é um pouco mais curto e não tem inimigos ou armas novas, também se utilizando da mesma mecânica e gráficos dos demais. Contudo, é uma história diferente, passando-se entre os mesmos acontecimentos, e você visita novos setores da Black Mesa. Aqui você está na pele de Barney Calhoun, um segurança que visa escapar do local após o incidente em Half-Life ter profanado o caos. Apesar de não ter tantos detalhes de enredo quanto os outros dois jogos, vale a pena pra quem os jogou e quer ver os fatos em uma terceira perspectiva.			"

												Blue Shift isn't as long as Half-Life or even Opposing Force, and doesn't add any new tricks apart from a blue HUD and manual armor pickups, but is still worth it if you're a fan of classic Half-Life. You play as regular security guard Barney Calhoun, who turns out to be more resourceful and good at fighting things than most of his coworkers in his quest to escape Black Mesa. Suffice to say the story is still pretty good even if the stakes are lower than in HL or OPFOR...at first glance anyway.			"

												Goodies and oldies can never be interesting enough!Blue Shift is taking the player back during the Black Mesa Incident. You are Barney, a security guard who's trying to figure out what's going on and trying to survive. And yes, your that the same Barney with the guy who helps Gordon Freeman from Half Life 2! :)The game is pretty good and interesting for its time. A great add on to the Half Life franchise.It has all the cool things the first HL game had to offer (great FPS action, nice setting, spooky survival situations), and it's missing all the irritating things HL used to have (puzzling paths where you can lose yourself and wonder what your objective really is).If you are a HL fan, the chances you haven't played this is slim, but if so, totally go for it.If you are not a fan but are thinking about entering the HL world, then there's no doubt this titles is gonna add more to the fun of the first games :)			"

After playing Half Life: Opposing Force I was glad to have my flashlight and crowbar on full power back. You don't get any special weapons to fight with and you won't fight any new enemies. Your mission is simply to find and save several scientists who will rely on you that you are able to do all the dirty work which leads to getting out of the facility unharmed. You won't get stuck in the map in this second expansion. Yay! Success!  Recommended! Time to move on to Half Life 2!			"

												This is a different point of view of Valve's famous first-person shooter, Half Life. In Blue Shift, you are playing as Gordon's friend Barney Calhoun, instead of Gordon himself. The game starts off with you on a train in the Black Mesa Transit System just like Gordon. After listening to that annoying, 5 minute automated message, you arrive at your station and set off into the labs. However, just as you were beginning to become relaxed, the Resonance Cascade begins and everything goes down hill from there as you are forced to fight for your life and escape the Black Mesa Facility.

I personally  love the fact that this game portrays the events in the shoes off Barney Calhoun a security guard who works for Black Mesa. This is one of the games that I would play again and again and being a vetaran Half-Life player I do just that.The only thing I would say is the shortness of the gameplay however that is irrelevant as the storyline is brill!For £3.99 this game is a bargain!

Blue Shift is a spin off of the original Half~Life game where you are playing through the same event as ""Barny the Security Guard"" who is just trying to survive and make it out alive.  If you have not played any of the Half~Life games I recommend you start with the Original Half~Life and follow the Game series plot line from the start.			"

												This is a different point of view of Valve's famous first-person shooter, Half Life. In Blue Shift, you are playing as Gordon's friend Barney Calhoun, instead of Gordon himself. The game starts off with you on a train in the Black Mesa Transit System just like Gordon. After listening to that annoying, 5 minute automated message, you arrive at your station and set off into the labs. However, just as you were beginning to become relaxed, the Resonance Cascade begins and everything goes down hill from there as you are forced to fight for your life and escape the Black Mesa Facility.

												'Blue Shift' starts at the beginning of 'Half Life' from the POV of a security guard, you will have to master the same puzzle solving skills as Gordon Freeman to survive the alien/military attack on Black Mesa, with the help of scientists, travelling to Xen and back. Although very enjoyable, the DLC is just a tad too short, an extra level where you get to help out Freeman for instance, would have been the perfect conclusion.			"

												I've heard many reviews saying this game is bad. I disagree, this is a great game. It's the original Half-Life from Barney Calouhn's perspective, and Gordon Freeman makes a couple cameos too! The story is just as interesting, the gameplay just as enjoyable, the graphics still hold up fourteen years later, and it's cheap (During the holidays it's 2 dollars, and 5 the rest of the year). One thing that might be a problem is it's length, only six chapters. But if that doesn't bother you then Half-Life: Blue Shift will be a blast. This is obviously the most underrated Half-Life game/ expansion.			"

												half life blue shift is by no means a bad game.... just short. what i mean is that for the same price of this game, you can go and by half life opposing force, which i highly recomend, its longer, has more weapons, better story, and also has multiplayer. again, blue shift isn't bad, its just considering that opposing force is the same price and far bigger and better, go buy opposing force. if you have maybe 2-3 hours to kill and you already have opposing force, then get this.

												A great supplement to the orginal Half Life and Opposing Force. Features- Play as a security guard whom attempts to escape after the ressonance cascade- a short but enjoyable amount of content- a unique view on the Half Life universe and lore- consists mostly of puzzles instead of combat sections, with that said, the puzzles are pretty simple and seem to help pacing.- classic Valve action- can run on practically any pc from 2000's to the modern dayCons-graphically not too advanced (may bother only a few though)- runs with a few minor startup errors, especially on modern pcs- has occasional crashes- no servers running for multiplayer deathmatches- generally a short campaign only 2 to 3 hours longI would highly advise the purchase of this product.

												Half-Life: Blue Shift, released in 2001 by Gearbox Software alongside Valve, published once more by Sierra Entertainment, has often been called the 'lame duck' of the Half life expansions.It's certainly shorter than the others, and doesn't really bring anything new along to the original game dynamic aside from character story.But for those of us that played Half-Life because they thought it was a good story overall, (Even if Xen still made little sense to you) :Blue Shift offers a short sharp return to the world we know. If you wish to know how Barney made it out of Black Mesa, you could spend four hours or so on far worse things.			"

												Half-Life Blue Shift takes place while Half-Life 1 takes place. You play as a security guard who does things while the events of Half-Life 1 unfold.Overall the game is pretty fun, especially if there is any nostalgia feel for you. The game plays almost exactly like Half-Life 1, with the environment, weapons, enemies, and almost everything being the same as Half-Life 1 (DUH its the same time). There aren't as many creative ways to finish some of the levels and overall Half-Life Blue Shift is a bit less complex and a whole lot shorter.If you are a Half-Life fan, this is a great game, especially since it sets up one of the main characters to come.Rating: 8.8/10Recommend Price: $2.49 or below			"

It's ultimately the same story, although you are in the shoes of the other personnel. I love the game! One of the best spin-offs of a game that I've ever seen and I'm glad it was created. If you enjoyed the original Half-Life, I strongly suggest that you play Half-Life: Blue Shift! It's worth every penny!-Kyle James			"

												While this game is in my opinion the worst out of the two Half-Life expansions, but I still enjoyed it. Even though I do think the game should of been longer. It only took me at least two and a half hours to beat. And they're even less weapons in this game than there is in the original Half-Life! Story: In this game, you play as Barney Calhoun (most of you should recognize him from Half-Life 2) and just like Half-Life: Opposing Force, this game takes place the same time as the original Half-Life and much like Gordan and Shepard, Barney has to go though all kinds of hazzards in order to escape Black-Mesa!Pros+ You get to play as Barney+ Nice story+ Its got nice homages to the original Half-Lifes story+ Good charactersCons- Very short - Nothing new addedOverall I do recomend this game to anyone who enjoyed the original Half-Life and Opposing Force.

												In Blue Shift, you play Barry Calhoun, the security guard featured prominently in HL2 and briefly in the first game. Basically, in Blue Shift, your goal is to escape. Barry meets up with various scientists until he finds Dr. Rosenberg who tasks him with setting up a teleportation machine to escape outside of main Black Mesa compound, other scientists are with Rosenberg as well. The story is rather short, about 2 hours to beat if you bum rush it and play on easy, which is what I did. But it was still fun as it expands on the Half Life universe and you get to hear other characters talk about Freeman and even Shepard, the guy from Opposing Force.Graphically and technically, Blue Shift has not aged well. The textures are pretty terrible and Barry slides like crazy after letting go of ""w"". It's kind of annoying. I can't blame the devs for the textures though, the game is rather old. But the wasd controls are so clunky. At least the level designs were still great.Pretty good game, super short story though. And I wasn't as invested as I could have been.8.3/10			"

												Short? Yep. Worst original singleplayer game in the series? No doubt. Still fun as hell? You got it.Despite effectively being a truncated version of the original Half-Life and a limited arsenal (not even a glimpse of weapons from Opposing Force, for instance), this game still delivers a classic HL experience with a new storyline.Plus, you play as Barney.

												What is Half Life: blue shiftHalf life: blue shift is a standalone expansion pack for Half Life. Half life: blue shift was originally meant to be part of the Dreamcast version of Half life just like how Decay is for the PlayStation 2 version but unfortunately before the production of the Dreamcast version began Sega announced that they would be discontinuing the Dreamcast, so Gearbox ported Blue shift over to the PC. Half life: blue shift also was the first expansion to include the HD content which was meant to be for the Dreamcast version originally. What the HD content did was that it replaced things such as the MP5 for a higher quality assault rifle and it replaced some NPC models as well, in my opinion i don't really like the HD models so i have turned them off in the options menu.The storyIn Half life: blue shift you play as a security guard called Barney Calhoun who was later used has a main character in Half Life 2. Before the Black Mesa incident Barneys job was to protect the equipment and personnel within area 3 of Black Mesa but when the incident happens your main goal is to escape the facility.The pros of Half life: blue shift- Good story that fills in the gap of the Half life story line- The game has some very good level design- The AI was very good for its time and still is since they react to different thing such as if you wait near a door the marines will throw in grenades- You have to interact with NPC's in order to progress through game, this is good because your not just opening doors like you did in the original Half life- There are decent puzzles and they evenly spaced out in the game- The game is very enjoyable including the combat even though enemy's can seem like they can take several rounds in the headWhat is bad about Half life: blue shift- One of the most obvious things is that nothing new was really added to the game such as weapons, enemy's etcetera- The game is very short only taking me around 3 hours to complete and that was without doing the tutorial section of  the game- I found that the game was easy even though i was playing on hard- some times i got stuck on the environment such as in between boxes or on the walls located in XenOverall Half life: Blue shift is a very good game but does have a few issues but they don't affect the game too much since the game is very enjoyable, also even though the game is very short it is also very cheap so you do get what you pay for. I do recommend getting this game if you like any Half life game or just generally like old school first person shooters like doom, but if that is the case then you would of most likely would of played a Half life game.

I'm not going to say much else in this review as there isn't all that much content in the game itself, but here goes. Basically, its the story of how Barney gets out. Thats pretty much it. You get most of the same weapons from Half-Life, and there are various references to Half-Life and Half-Life: Opposing Force, but other than that, its a mediocre FPS game in the Half-Life chain, thats a bit less fun than its other two counterparts, and was shorter to play than HL2 Episode 1. Overall, I recommend this game mainly because it fills in a few of the blanks for the later story, but, in my opinion, you're probably better off getting Half-Life: Opposing Force.~Fibcoa7			"

Only recommended if- You have played halflife one(opposing forces is good to have played too)- If you don't mind an old game with lots of small bugs. you have to be a somewhat retrogamer.- If you really love the halflife franchies.(Maybe nostalgic about the game too)- if you want the complete original halflife game history in your library- If you love Calhoun from the later installmentsIf you cannot say yes to any of these, don't bother, Blue shift isn't that good.But for me is was an enjoyment because halflife is my childhood :)As a halflife fan you can skip it, it doesn't matter tribute that much to the story. :)The killers of this game- The game is old, buggy, just like all of the others. No upgrading what so ever in graphic or anything else, shame on you valve!- Lack new content, after having been playing opposing forces with a great range of new weapons, then this seems like a set back, also they seem to have forgot the X-race O.o which they introduced in opposing forces. - This can be somewhat good or bad, but the game has the same way of narrative(or lack of it) in the game like the others. Some people might be turned off- WAAAYYYYY TOO SHORT... Feels lacking, not like a whole ""complete"" game.The sunshines of the game- I am pretty sure if you love Calhoun in the later installment, you would like this one :)- Maybe a piece of lovely nostalgia- Somewhat very much like the original halflife, so if you still need more this can maybe satisfy your cravings.I can only highlight that is NOT something for players who have not played halflife original or hate elder games. But in the end it is a allround game, for me it was lacking and I liked opposing forces so much better, but I still had a craving for halflife, so this was good for me. :)			"

												A neat little side story to the original Half-Life game.If you haven't played Half-Life before then you should look at that game first. Maybe even get the bundle since it's cheaper.Half-Life IS over 20 years old though, so keep that in mind when judging the graphics. The controls and physics on the other hand have aged very nicely and are extremely comfortable to use. I highly recommend it, especially if you're into shooters.			"

												This game shares the same structure and mechanical flaws that Half-Life has, being effectively the same game.  Where this game is set apart from that game though, is in the construction and flow of the game.  This one, (a much shorter game), flows much better, and other than one or two spots, it forgoes the platform game style that Half-Life has.  Only occassionally do you have to leap, duck and weave across impossible terrain and asinine engineered structures, and by the removal of this completely annoying aspect of the original game, this one has not aged as poorly.... Let's face it, games back then, especially of this genre, grew from those platform styled games, and it's what game developers knew, but it's old hat and it doesn't stack up well.  Thankfully Blue Shift doesn't fall into that old game cliche often.The plot for Blue Shift flows better as well.  Instead of just hunting down an alien to kill it, this is a better defined story arc, requiring working towards a non-violent goal of escape (though not without a good dose of alien and military murder-mayhem along the way).  Interesting, considering in the original you're a scientist and this one you're a security guard.For anyone that is curious about Half-Life, this is probably the game for you, since it's short and IMO, better.  (still be prepared for Crate Smashing II - Return of the Exploding Rubbish, and for clunky and clumsy game controls.3.5/5			"

												This game ties with the first Half-Life game and Half-Life: Opposing Force. You play as Barney Calhoun on a normal day to work at the Black Mesa Reasearch facility, but crap goes wrong and just like Half-Life 1 and Opposing Force, you have to fight aliens from the planet Xen. The game is good so I'll put that there, and you just fight off aliens and squads of stupid NPC Marines trying to kill you of course. The gameplay is not too bad, but the annoying part of the game is that if you use Windows Vista or 7, you may be prone to more game problems and crashes due to the fact the game was not optimized for newer operating systems. You use Windows 8, well you probably don't because the game probably doesn't work for 8. I recommend you use an older machine with Windows 2000 at the highest because this game is pretty old, even for XP. If you do use a older machine, like a Windows 2000 machine to play it you might want to make sure you meet the system requirements so you are not angered by the fact your 2000 OS machine sucks♥♥♥♥♥ The games final rating in my general opinion is 9/10.Up next in reviews by Dead Kitty: Half-Life: Opposing Force!

												In Blue Shift you play as Barney Calhoun, the nervous yet rugged security guard from the original. This game was really short but a lot of fun, it adds more to the world of Half Life and more to the story. The graphics are old school but the gameplay is well done and keeps you going. The guns and character design were all very well done and gave the feel the game really needed. It's certainly worth taking a look at if you're a fan of Half-Life, but you better keep your eyes open because your heading back to Black Mesa, but it's going to be over in a ""flash""			"

												A good addition to the Half-Life series, it does not add much of anything new and is a bit shorter than Half-Life, but gives you a good view of the fall of the Black Mesa facility through the eyes of a security officer stationed there. Throughout the game you will see characters like the G-Man, Gordon freeman and a few others as they go through the events of Half-Life and you will get a better feeling for what life was like for those people who were stationed at the Black Mesa facility before and during the ""attack"".

												I was first introduced to Half-Life: Blue Shift by a dear friend when I was in school. Regrettably, he then took ill for a large amount of time and after that I never heard of him again, but before that he gave me his retail copy of this game. Even after all this time, whenever I play this game I remember the good old days drinking Pepsi Twist over at his house and playing this game until we beat it. Having been both fans of the original Half-Life back in the days we both enjoyed playing this new episode, impersonating a security guard in the Black Mesa Research Facility.As for the gameplay, it's the same as in Half-Life but with some changes in what is mechanics and weapons. Just some minor tweaks. Some locations are revisited, some moments of Dr. Freeman's voyage through the installation can be witnessed, and there are many new locations never seen before.As an expansion to the original game, this game is a blast and kicks♥♥♥♥♥ I'd take this over many new shooters.I dedicate this review - my 100th review on Steam - to my friend. Wherever you are, know that I'm still playing this game while drinking Pepsi and remembering the good old times.			"

												My review for Half-Life can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/70I like to call this game Half-Life: But S.h.i.t.Whats this? A NEGATIVE Half-Life game review? Best to downvote it and not read it. As long as something has Half-Life in the title it can't POSSIBLY be♥♥♥♥♥♥ No. Boring at best and flat out bad at worst Blue Shift has the honor of being Half-Life's red headed step child (No offense to red headed step children.). Many will assume that because it's related to Half-Life it's good or that because it's a expansion much like Opposing Force which is one of the best expansions ever made. Opposing Force was pretty damn good as far as expansions go so this being the Yang to Opposing Forces Yin is disappointing. The only worthwhile thing to come from this was one of the many Barney's getting the last name Calhoun. It has dull puzzles, and uninteresting story that tells nothing new, glitchy physics for NPC's on elevators which was something that both Half-Life Oh, and it has lengthy sewer levels. ""How could something made by Valve be bad?"" you say. Opposing Force and But S h i t were made by Gearbox in addition to an often forgotten COOP addon for a PS2 port of Half-Life that was worked on by Gearbox. I don't dislike it because it's by Gearbox as that would be petty but if you are inclined to defend it for the glory of Valve as opposed to based on his own merits than at least you know it wasn't now. Opposing Force is one of the few expansions that was not only great but could stand on it's own. While Opposing Force is non canon dissapointingly all thanks to it's inclusion of aliens called Race X. Meanwhile Blue Shift is canon but that might be because it has no new weapons or aliens. Considering the time and location Shepard arrived at Black Mesa it's not to hard to believe that there may be weapons Gordon didn't find as the HECU related weapons that Shepard would come across weren't very common comapred to the MP5/M4. No new weapons is sort of excusable having played future titles like Half-Life 2: Episode 1 and 2 but considering Opposing Force was probably made by similar people it's ridiculous that they learned nothing and that there was no variety. No Race X? Thats fine. Race X don't fit in with Half-Life's aliens and they and the marines suffered from surprisingly bad AI. In Blue Shift the environments are linear, uninteresting and look really out of place. They are REALLY flat. You have sewers, parking lots, sewers, storage rooms, parking lots, sewers, parking lots and Xen. That's a lot of variety ey? All the puzzles take forever and the peices for them move slow as hell. The combat encounters are also a  bore and primarily take place in these afformentioned parking lots which while outdoors don't seem to be part of the facility thanks to poor artistic cohesion. I don't swear often but I must to get to the point and be brash. You are a security gaurd. In Black Mesa. And luckily you are Barney Calhoun out of all of them. Yeah not much is going to happen this should be pretty grounded. Then again this is Black Mesa. Other then the arbitrary showing Black Mesa go to hell during the resonance cascade whats there to show? How many dull ♥♥♥♥ing puzzles can one gaurd survive? I like puzzles so why is this game so bad at them? Where the ♥♥♥♥ are other friendly NPCs and security gaurds after the resonance cascade? You'll see one get killed by zombies and another thrown in a pit but thats all I can recall. Why doesn't Barney talk? The amount of mutes around here is getting out of control. Not only that but if it's canon why is Barney so quiet? If Barney spoke that would really give it some personality. Also I get Barneys resourceful but without the HEV suit or some protective gear he should look like swiss cheese. The story on offer is just so meaningless and worse yet the gameplay is hampered by the awful design. The fact it's version of Xen managed to be WORSE than Xen in Half-Life is amazing. Not to mention he goes to space with nothing but what you see him wearing on the cover. Who needs a space suit when you can hold your breath right? Stay away and buy Opposing Force or Half-Life if you haven't already!My review for Opposing Force can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/50 "

												Half Life: Blue Shift is an expansion of the first Half Life where we play as a security guard and we relive the Black Mesa incident through his eyes but will you want to play it ? In Half Life: Blue Shift we play as Barney Calhoun who works as a security guard  at Black Mesa. The alien and soldier attack happens and we need to escape. So how is Half Life: Blue Shift ? Well I wish there was a mediocre button cause this game ain't bad, but it isn't good either. Compared to Opposing Force this adds nothing to the original game. No new weapons, horrible level design and incredibly short. This expansion  is really nothing special and it pains me to say that. The gameplay isn't even fun this time as this time it revolves around jumping puzzles and not so much around gun fights. This expansion is also really easy compared to Half Life as there is no threat standing in your way. The game is still fun enough for you to finish it but it is very disappointing. Overall there is not much to say about Half Life: Blue Shift. It's not a bad game but it's not good compared to Opposing Force and Half Life. If you want to finish the entire series than by all means pick it up, but if not than wait for a sale or skip this entirely.  I give Half Life: Blue Shift a 6/10			"

												Unfortunately Blue Shift is not a good game for a bunch of reasons: #1 It brings next to nothing into the Half Life lore, #2 It has EXACTLY the same mechanics as Half-Life, bringing nothing new, and #3 It is actually terribly boring. Sure, It's a Half-Life game, which means that it's going to be fun and ingaging, but I would much rather recommend the far superior original Half-Life - this is basically just a rehash of that. Only get this if you're a hardcore Half-Life fan.			"

												its tough. it was released in 2001 but didn't really make as much of a game as Opposing Force did in my opinion. its cool cause you play as Barney Calhoun and you get to see more stuffs that you didn't in the original, but its still the same except you get Helmets and Kevlar instead of Batterys or Chargers, but the same weapons are used again. and in Teaser, you even got a handheld Flashlight. but that was cut. and it seems the vortigaunts have a differant design in the screenshots, but the same stuff was carried over. no Opposing Force stuff was recycled, except Otis Laury appears 3 times, but you cant have him with you. thats the thing though. you are completely alone. and the guards are all dead when you meet them. find them i mean. if Gearbox really put some effort into this, it would have made a game as good as Opposing Force. overall, a 5.3/10. room for improvement. but i still recomend it as another item to collect in the Half-Life series. hope i helped.

												""Now I wonder if those boys could've made a bigger mess?""Blue Shift takes the perspective of security guard Barney Calhoun during the Black Mesa Incident. Barney would go on to become a major character in Half-Life 2 and its episodes, and playing as such an awesome character brings a lot of fun to Blue Shift. There are no new weapons or enemies, but Blue Shift manages to dish out more amazing action while giving a fittingly different feel from Half-Life and OP4. Playing as Barney makes the player feel ill-equipped and often lowly, due to the limited arsenal and wonderfully condescending dialogue from scientists who give you crap for no reason whatsoever. It may be short, but Blue Shift hasn't a single dull moment and remains a triumph of expansion packs with its intuitive puzzle design, interesting story, and pulse pounding action sequences.			"

												Nice DLC, only took me two hours to complete. Again, nice to see what would've happened from the officers side. Seeing Freeman being dragged off quite shocked me, I'll just assume that the Opposing force and Blue Shift are cannon, but still, great expansions enjoyed them both.			"

												The best feature about this DLC is you get to play as Barney Calhoun. You know, the guy from Half Life 2. And you play from his perspective to escape Black Mesa. Other than that, there isn't much to say. Except that this DLC is the shortest in the original Half Life I've played; It took me a little under 4 hours to play through from start to finish, as oppose to Opposing Force that took me 5 hours to complete.Half Life: Blue Shift gets a 7/10. I would get it when it goes on sale.See you on the next review.   ~Stealth 1548			"

												Well... I did enjoy it... a lot, actually.  Blue Shift is an expansion taking place from the beginning of HL1 to the chapter Apprehension, where Gordon is captured by HECU forces.  But wait, that was still somewhat early in the game, right?  ...Yeah.  We'll get to that.First, I just want to address the things it really got right.  Blue Shift feels like it should-- a complete expansion to the original.  As a security guard, you start off the game first locked out of the office as Gordon slides by looking at you slightly amused, then stopping at the firing range, and watching the Anomalous Materials experiment get prepared on CCTV's.  There's an extreme attention to detail spanning most of the game, and it feels like Gearbox always kept in mind what was happening on Gordon's side.It also does an excellent job of tying together storylines.  While interactions are rare between the stories of Gordon (HL1), Barney (BS), and Adrian (OF), there are constant references and signs where someone who played the other games will recognize key events.  It's definitely interesting to see HL1's plot rewritten from a simple linear story to a whole universal event, now being explored by three radically different roles.On the side, the actual game is... solid.  The levels are decent, the story is good, and overall it feels like more HL1 minus the benefits of the HEV suit, instead opting for standard body armor.  There just isn't that much different from HL1 once you get past the blue HUD and story.  Thankfully, the levels are a completely new deal and while you'll cross paths with key events, the game still stands on its own without constantly relying on you to connect it to the base game.  It's not the kind of game where not knowing the original storyline leaves you completely clueless-- Barney discovers the HECU's mission on his own, he goes through his own escape and survival, and he meets with other scientists in his escape.Still, the biggest flaw I can point out is its time.  Three hours, total.  I'd like to say I got lost or stuck twice.  This is by no means a long game.  Yet, by the end it does start to feel like it overstays its welcome anyway.  It even follows up a teleporter and alien encounter with a fetch quest for more batteries.  FETCHING!  While the pacing in the beginning is exactly as it should be, I feel like the last stage of the game simply dragged on for far longer than it should have.  Still, while not difficult in any sense of the word, the finale is definitely alright for a small expansion-- rather than a boss battle, you more or less follow your fetch quest with an interactive cutscene, which even foreshadows the ""Red Letter Day"" in HL2 to an extent.Perhaps the biggest thing I can say against Blue Shift, though, is that it has no multiplayer.  This was criminal.  Absolutely unacceptable.  For shame!So yes, I will recommend it, but rather half-heartedly.  You'll have fun with it, but HL1 and Opposing Force have much more to offer.  They're both more interesting and better executed than Gearbox's second expansion ended up being.  Not to mention, it offers much less in content than HL1, which went on for around 9-15 hours plus multiplayer deathmatch, and Opposing Force, which while also somewhat short featured an overhauled multiplayer with CTF and more weapons.  Play those first, and when you see a good sale or don't have other games you can get for this price, go for it.==UPDATE==As commanderox pointed out, you may experience a gamebreaking bug in the opening chapter that prevents you from equipping your body armor and helmet (which triggers an event).  I didn't run into this personally, but a restart should be enough to fix it.			"

Unlike Opposing Force wich gave us new weapons, multiplayer map's and just a interesting story all in general, Blue Sh*t gives us almost no weapons, a boring story, NO MULTIPLAYER and was short as f*ck. A lot of the reviews you'll see will praise it mostly because it's just in the Half-Life series. If you want my advice, stay away from it unless you're a SERIOUS Half-Life Fan like me and some of my friends.			"

												Before I go on I want to say a few things about this game. 1. I know this ""game"" is old but if it's a game that is bad than it's bad regardless of age. 2.I'm going to compare this alot to the original half life becuase it is more of a expansion pack to half life which tells the story from a different POV. 3.This is my opinion so if you don't like it than don't say Im high or Im gay or you ironically feel bad for me since you as a human being(the most intelegent speicies on the planet) can just ignore critizm.The actual review:      So after I beat half life 1's campain a bunch of times I decided to see what this piece had to offer and I was slightly disapointed. The graphics were ok, I mean They didn't add anything new in terms of graphics but they could do worse. The gameplay didn't seem so bad in fact just like the graphics it seems to be exactly the same as half life 1 (yes I know this is a expansion pack) so whats exactly bad about this game you may ask in your head? well for one the pacing and dificulty curve. The game is way too short and the campain lasted me 2-3 hours(the 5.1 was becuase I played it multiple times) and most of what made it dificult was spawn a bunch of enemies and see if you can kill them all to advance to the next area (refering to when you find the scientist in a train's box car.). At the end you (as Barney not Gordon this time) escape Black mesa with a bunch of scientists in a car around the time black mesa is getting bombed. In short this game wasn't exactly bad so to say but it felt very bland and lacking. I say don't get this one unless your planning on getting 1/3 bundles this game is attached to like a parasite living off of the other games for reconition.			"

												This review originally written on May 21, 2012 on GameFAQs""The weakest of the Half-Life games, but more Half-Life is always good.""This is a standalone expansion of the original Half-Life, and the second and final expansion. I recommend everyone plays this first after Half-Life and before Opposing Force for various reasons I will explain. The ratings and my feelings of this expansion are gauged in relation to the first Half-Life.STORY: 9/10You play as Barney Calhoun, security guard. You are actually the security guard you see banging on the door at the very beginning of Half-Life, pretty cool how it's all linked. You experience the events of the resonance cascade but at different parts of the facility. Your main goal is to escape with the scientists. The story actually isn't bad, but it ends kind of abruptly and feels like there should have been a little more.GRAPHICS: 9/10These are the same graphics as the original Half-Life which is both good and bad. The good part is it all looks the same and this expansion came with an HD pack for all the original Half-Life games. The bad part is that when this game came out in 2001 the graphics were starting to look dated even for the time. This isn't a big deal to me as I enjoy the graphics (with the HD pack).SOUND: 9/10The sound is the same as Half-Life. Not changing the alien sounds is fine, but I would've liked some new voices for the guards and scientists. Although there is a new voice for a certain scientist, that's it.WEAPONS: 8/10The weapon system works the same as Half-Life but you get a fewer selection of weapons to play with and no new ones. This is very disappointing.ENEMIES: 9/10You see a return of nearly all of the enemies from Half-Life, but that's it. There is nothing new which is again disappointing.LEVEL DESIGN: 10/10This is the only part where this game lives up to Half-Life. The level design is very similar and the few puzzles and situations where you must figure out what to do are very fun. And you get to revisit my favorite level!LENGTH AND REPLAYABILITYThis game is extremely short, clocking in at 2 hours, 2 and a half if you play on hard and take your time like I did. Still, it is fun to play as Barney and re-experiencing the levels in a future playthrough is certainly viable.FINAL SCORE: 9/10The game is good and well made, but rushed and without any real new content. You should play this before Opposing Force because if you play it after you will be disappointed expecting this to at least be on the level of content of Opposing Force. If you liked Half-Life, this is still a must play.			"

Blueshift is half-life played as a Black-Mesa security guard. While playing as a different main character, with different levels and a different perspective on the plot, it's essentially the same game, taking place at the same time as the original half-life game. If you liked half-life, you should play this, as it's just as good. Everyone knows half-life, so why should I even bother going into detail about this game? Just consider it additional levels.			"

He was the real deal back then and he is the real deal now!This game is an expansion/DLC to Half-Life and is a lot smaller, but shows you a different point of view of the incident in Black Mesa. Events from the base game are successfully showcased in this one too and you can even see Gordon at the end of the game. Ending itself is also different and is pretty good.I don't see the point of buying this game if you haven't played HL or aren't a fan though. If you are, then you probably should.			"

												Most people say that this is simply more of the same from the first Half Life. I can't say the same, since every 5 minutes has a new game breaking bug. Sometimes it just crashes outright when loading a new area, sometimes it's an essential setpiece that never moves even though it should, and a few times, the game killed essential npcs near the beginning for no reason, resulting in a game over. Reloading an earlier save does not fix the problems, reinstalling usually fixes the particular bug that caused the problem  but it introduces even more. It makes me wonder if there was any playtesting of this. Buyers beware			"

												A nice addition to the Half-Life universe if not alil short. I felt that the full game had a good focus on both story and combat aspects. Then when I got to Opposing Forces it seemed more on the combat side of things with minor story aspects. This game seemed heavy on the story side with minor combat aspects. It was very short, it took me 3 hours, half as long as the previous add-on and 1/6th the length of the full game. Which is a shame because I actually thought it was better than the previous add-on. The ending was fairly anti-climatic as well...Both add-ons are nice expansions to the full game but do not seem to be necessary to understanding the storyline of the Half-Life universe as of yet... Maybe I'll find out more in Half-Life 2.7/10			"

												I have fond memories of playing Half-life and Opposing Force in my youth, when I read about the new expansion set to come out I was all set to go out and buy it. For one reason or another, I never did. I never thought Id ever revisit the original Half-Life series and never get round to playing Blue-Shift. A bit of free time and a steam sale later, I found myself buying all 3 for £2,74. A bargain!Anyway, I played through Half Life, Opposing Force and then finally Blue Shift, all in the space of about 4/5days. Blue shift is a good game, it is Half-life, but after playing Opposing Force, it just seems like they wern't even trying with this one. It was short, too easy, no new enemies, no new gameplay mechaics, nothing of interest really, it didnt even have a boss/final fight. Im glad in only cost me pence, if I had bought it back in the day I think Id have been really disappointed. I played a lot of Mods on myy original, many of which were better than this official expansion.Play the game, its worth 99p, but dont expect too much.(Anybody know what the zombie game was called and the western, both got released on CD i believe with some magazine.)

												This is the Half Life I have enjoyed the least from the originals. That being said, it's not a bad game at all and any Half Life fan should play through this one if they haven't already. It's only a bit weird to see a security officer fight off large amounts of military and aliens. In the previous games security officers were dead all over and seemed weak without the HEV suit or it's military version. Blue Shift is also really small, sadly, with about 4 to 5 hours of gameplay. Still a brilliant game and there is no reason for you not to buy it and enjoy it.

												Probably still a must-play for anyone who's fond of the original Half-Life and it's first expansion - Opposing Force.So why don't I recommend this one? First of all, it's very short - took me only 3 hours to beat. Second - enemy placement and spawning is just cheap sometimes. Third - at long ranges enemy AI kind of spazzes out and often completely ignores the player, even if the player shoots them, which is very evident at some of the latest stages in the game. Fourth - there is less enemy and weapon variety than even in the original game, and there is nothing added in the previous expansion pack, Opposing Force.But ultimately it all doesn't matter, since you've probably already got it for dirt cheap as a part of Half-Life or Valve bundle and never gonna play it anyway :)			"

												If you liked the original Half Life, you will probably like this too. It's essentially the same, aside from showing the origin of Valve (so many valves you need to turn). This time the story is told from a guard's POV. Man, if only the other guards were as useful as Calhoun, the first Half Life would have been so much better!  Just like Freeman, Calhoun started his ordinary day at his job, until the incident happened. Being that Calhoun was a guard and experienced shooter, Blue Shift is more believeable than the original Half Life where a scientist becomes Rambo. Gameplay and visuals are the same since it's using the same engine. Unlike Half Life, it wasn't too heavy on the platforming, but that's probably because the game is really short. While I wasn't trying to break Half LIfe, I never encountered any problems with enemy AI. In Blue Shift, enemy AI was really terrible at times. At one point where you're locked in a truck with the scientist, they kept throwing grenades at the locked door and killed themselves. Another time I flanked them and they just froze and didn't register me at all after shooting them. Guess it isn't as polished as Half Life.NPCs are once again a chore. When I was escorting the scientist to the lab, he kept stopping and complaining that he's tired. The first time he did that was back in the truck. He didn't even leave the truck and he complained about beeing exhausted. Overall, the game was too short to stand out too much, and most of the gameplay was too similar to Half Life. It was still fun playing it and a nice touch, getting to play as one of the guards. From what I hear, this event gets completely ignored in Half Life 2, but can't complain about that, as nothing much happened story wise in this expansion. 6/10			"

												This is the Half Life I have enjoyed the least from the originals. That being said, it's not a bad game at all and any Half Life fan should play through this one if they haven't already. It's only a bit weird to see a security officer fight off large amounts of military and aliens. In the previous games security officers were dead all over and seemed weak without the HEV suit or it's military version. Blue Shift is also really small, sadly, with about 4 to 5 hours of gameplay. Still a brilliant game and there is no reason for you not to buy it and enjoy it.

												I would only reommend this game to someone whose played the Half-life or any other Half-life game before.  From the same friend that introduced me to the Half-life series, I also received knowledge of the splinter games to Half-life and the impression that this game would be about Barney. Wait... Calhoun is Barney? So, I wasn't lied to. Then why didn't any body refer to him as Barney. Where we suppose to know Barney as Calhoun? Regardless, Half-life: Blue Shift made me want to take back on quesioning whether Half-life was too long. Half-life: Blue Shift's brevity and instatenous action brought  an increase satisfaction for Gordon Freeman storyline. I suspect that the game was used to experiment with new mechanics for future games, relative to the release to this game. I admit a certain number of standstill problem solving took a large amount of my time. Fortunately, I didn't need any guides or cheat to figure them out, but that didn't change the very awkwardness of the resolutions. From the spand of 4 hours that it took to finish the game on normal, you can tell that a large portion of the consistented of more tactical problem solving versus rat-in-the-maze problem solving. I cannot argue since I enjoyed the process of ""How do I take care of these guys? Well, I seem to be safe in this corner and can shotgun any who pop through that doorway... Wait, they have grenades right now, don't they. Crap, speak of the DEVIL!""Although I cannot think of a way to resolve this, I found the ending dissatisfying and unfulfilling. If not for the credits soon after, I would have thought I still had a chapter or two to still go, but without any closure for the game it ended. I also didn't care for the thrid wheel feel to the game. As Barney, You get to do so much, and carry the story to lead into the Half-life 2 saga. Yes, You see G-man, but much like Gordan Freeman, G-man remains behind the seams.My overall thought is that I would not recommend this game. I cannot think of a reason to tell some ""yeah go get this game it has this, and that and so expands on what you would have known about the Half-life series."" The game is not a bad game, but I cannot see myself telling someone that the game's worth their time.Overall, I'd rate this 5/10.			"

												A nice addition to the Half-Life universe if not alil short. I felt that the full game had a good focus on both story and combat aspects. Then when I got to Opposing Forces it seemed more on the combat side of things with minor story aspects. This game seemed heavy on the story side with minor combat aspects. It was very short, it took me 3 hours, half as long as the previous add-on and 1/6th the length of the full game. Which is a shame because I actually thought it was better than the previous add-on. The ending was fairly anti-climatic as well...Both add-ons are nice expansions to the full game but do not seem to be necessary to understanding the storyline of the Half-Life universe as of yet... Maybe I'll find out more in Half-Life 2.7/10			"

												This is an addon, or should I say, a spin off or something, it's basically half life 1 but in perspective of Barney(Gordon's Friend that is more shown in half life 2) This game runs on the same engine as Half Life 1, but a bit more stable. This game is a bit shorter, same good shooter mechanics and great game overall.Cons: -Good story-Great level design-Great pace of the story-Really good characters-Good interactive ""minigames"" I could sayPros:-When quicksaving in some places like the last minutes of the game, you will instantly crash, repeatedly.-Sometimes a bit too difficult, but the difficulty can be adjusted though.-Sometimes some Xen levels are confusing-Only occasionally difficult to find out the objective.My personal opinion:     Overall it's a must buy to a shooter lover, half life series fan or anyone basically. It's nearly 2 decades old, but still is enjoyable until today. 8.9/10. If it were to have some patch updates, I would put 9.5/10.			"

												This game is really good, much better than Opposing Force. Gone are the stupid weapons and enemies and back are the really good ones from the original. The first half of the game the quality of the mapping is about the same as Opposing Force’s, but in the second half it does get a lot better. There is also a considerably better flow and story compared to Opposing Force, here there actually is one compared to the no existent one in Opposing Force.There are no reused sections, although some did seem to take a lot of inspiration from Half-Life’s. However there is a heavy use of sections where you need to go a long way around just to open a door, this is done multiple times. Also not all the weapons are used, this is a good thing is some ways since everything in this game was not out of place, but there are still some non-energy\Xen weapons that are not used.The main problem with the game is that is it too short, it really does feel like they made half the game, then ran out of time. This would explain the lake of weapons and also the lack of difficulty increase, there is no end boss and the end point does feel like a mid-point.But this game is really good, if you had to choose between this and Opposing Force, choose this. Opposing Force was not that great, this however is really good, in some ways better than Half-Life. "

The Xen level was decent though.I got this as part of the valve complete pack when that was on sale for silly little money so I can't complain but I wouldn't spend £4 on this individually, there are better games to spend £4 on.To sum up: this is non-essential Half Life.

												Well this was underwhelming. I'll vote the game down. Why? Because if one buys the Anthology, he won't care about this at all. But if someone checks the individual games, maybe gets a little look into the game, and I hope that can understand this. To be really short: game is too short, quite shallow, less guns, less varied environments - nowhere as good as HL or Opposing Forces.HL Blue Shift currently stands at 90% positive reviews, while HL and Opposing Forces if I remember well has 96% and 95%  positives, and I have to agree with the trend - the game was fine, but not even as good as HL (This is my third, final review of the anthology - in my book Opposing Forces > Half-Life > Blue Shift, simply based amount the fun I had while playing)The game features a really awesome physics based puzzle (barrels in coolant), had a fun part shooting gas cannisters' top to make them shoot at a door, and a barrel-detonator puzzle  which is really questionable in my opinion. Otherwise this game feels like a well-written, longer trailer for Half-Life. Alien contact's majority are headcrabs, there are maybe two Alien Grunts and Masters - the enemy variety could have been better from the gameplay aspect - the lack of stronger enemies really felt like the protagonist is away from the bigger happenings, making him feel like an underdog.The gametime is about 3-4 hours, and the highs of it are the various little physics puzzles,  but other than that this game is everything but memorable.  We have less weapons than in the base game - Glock, Colt, machine gun, shotgun, rocket launcher, granade and satchel charge. (Plus Snarks, based on wiki) It's about the half of the arsenal we had in the base game or in Opposing Forces - this, with the short campaign makes this game nowhere as fun as the other titles were.

												Whereas Opposing Force was Half-Life if Gordon never went to Xen, Blue Shift is just a rerun of the first few levels of HL1. There's no new weapons (even less than HL1 for that matter), very few, if any, memorable set pieces, a handful of easy puzzles, lazy enemy encounters, and the whole experience in general just feels like it's going through the motions.It feels as if it was incomplete, not just because it's incredibly short either, but also because there's no real climax throughout the entire campaign! While Opposing Force was shorter than Half-Life, the tension was constantly rising until it was noticeably more difficult than HL1 ever became. Furthermore, OF introduced many new weapons and (somewhat finnicky) mechanics! You'd think if Blue Shift had nothing new to offer, they'd at least grab everything that made the original so great and go out with a bang, but sadly instead it goes out with a whimper.Shame really, the High Definition patch (circa 2000 standards) is nifty, but I can't say I would recommend going back and playing this one.

												This expansion sucks. I'm serious. In this expansion valve bombarded us with glitches when loading saves, an uniteresting and medicore story as well as the new graphics (they look WAY too qwirky) which they updated to the half life 1 and its expanions, there by TAKING AWAY the classic feel to the games. Also, the level design is even more questionable than HL1's and the puzzles rely too much on your abaility to grapple onto things in time. Overall, this expansion feels boring and unispired. The only good thing I found in it was that I was able to see what Black Mesa was like beofre the alien outbreak. Thanks alot valve. Atleast I have opposing force, that expasion is great. "

The gameplay was the same from half-life which is a plus but one has to wonder, why did valve let another company make this expension game?			"

												This game is a really lazy attempt to cash in on the popularity of Half-Life. The game is disappointingly short, lacks any serious challenge, interesting weapons, or new enemies. The story is also pretty lack luster. You play as Barney, the security guard you see pounding on the door in the intro to Half-Life, who is later used as a side character in Half-Life 2. The G-Man plays no serious role in the game, unlike his direct involvement in the endings of Half-Life, or Opposing Force. The ending (spoiler alert) falls completely flat. Get teleported to a parking lot, then drive away. No enemies, no hurry, no stress, no reward. Huzzah, right? I want to like this game, but I don't. Gearbox and Valve got really lazy. Your money is better spent on Opposing Force, about 10 new guns, about 5 new enemeis, new bosses, a pretty decent story, and an interesting new perspective. Blue Shift offers none of this, and isn't worth your time.			"

												The 2nd and final expansion to Half Life. Half Life Blue Shift puts you in the role of Barney Calhoun where you must help a group of scientists escape the Black Mesa facility. The game offers a fairly straight forward story but it's still pretty cool as now you get to play as one of the security guards.There are no new weapons, infact I accidently skipped the rocket launcher and those Snarks you get to throw at people. The only thing that is new is the HD texture pack which upgrades the textures of the NPCs and your weapons. Again as I said in the last two reviews this is highly subjective and it comes down to personal taste.The game lasted 3 hours for me and it's not as good as the original or Opposing Force but I say you should still play it anyway. It's got a nice enclosed story and still has the same combat and puzzles Half Life has to offer. All in all it's pretty fun and deserves a 7/10.			"

												I am writing this review under the assumption that you are buying this game alone and not in a bundle. Do not do what I am assuming. This game is way less fun and shorter than Half-Life or Opposing Force. That being said, it is not a bad idea to buy the Half-Life 1 Anthology, because that includes Blue Shift and Team Fortress Classic for the combined price of Half-Life and Opposing Force when not in a bundle. If you were looking for a Half-Life experience, but don't want to buy the Half-Life 1 Anthology, then buy Opposing Force because that expansion lasts a lot longer (6 hours to beat Opposing Force, while only 2.5 hours to beat Blue Shift) and has cooler weapons. I would only ever recommend buying Blue Shift alone if you already have both Opposing Force and Half-Life and are interested in learning more about the Half-Life backstory.			"

												I made the mistake of buying this for $5 after i had played through HL1, thinking it would extend the gameplay a little. This expansion, however is terrible as a standalone title. The level design is just not as interesting as it was in the original and ultimately the whole package feels lazy. I found myself feeling more frustrated than elated as i slogged through tests of attrition through gauntlets of soldiers, only to be mortified by more terrible xen jumping sequences from the first game. They were horrible in the first game and they were horrible here. All in all it just felt like a needy sibling, hanging off the coattails of the original's success. Stick with Opposing Force.			"

												Blue Shift has one of the most horrible single player games ever. I had more fun playing the free single player games in HL mods such as Azure Sheep (=very good) and Case Closed (=super short, though better than BS). DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Having played tons of free mods and Opposing Force, Blue Shift sucks big time. Opposing Force gives you cool new guns -- buy that instead if you really want to. Blue Shift was clearly phoned in as a project and that's why it sold poorly. The only good thing that BS added to HL was better quality textures, which you will get anyway if you buy any HL product. There is no reason to buy this garbage. It has a promising beginning and a new security guard model, though it is downhill from there. Don't let this game be a downhill of your wallet. All I can remember from this game is that it was frustrating and boring as hell and it ends suddenly as if the budget ran out. It is even worse than Gunman Chronicles, a retail Half-Life game too weak to get on Steam.			"

												I loved Half-Life as a kid. But this game sucks balls.The controls are overly sensitive, which is a huge factor considering that, atleast for the first part, you need to mvoe objects around, and make jumps from them. I died about 10 times trying to jump from a platform to a ladder. This is frustrating enough, but when you factor in the fact you fall to your death, if you 'bounce off' the ladder, it makes for a very frustrating game. I rage quit with frustration, and will never play again. The graphics are awful too, but it is an old game, so that doesn't bother me.			"

												Blue Shift an expansion to the Half-Life franchise but as with any expansion to Half-Life it feels a little underwhelming when held up against the multitude of magnificent mods available for free.Blue Shift casts you as the security guard Barney, letting Gorden Freeman have some quiet time until Half-Life 2 is released and sends you on your marry way through alien monstrosities and overzealous government soldiers. It plays much the same as the original, the weapons and enemies remain unchanged and the maps will feel eerily familiar as you battle through the corridors of Black Mesa.The game just doesn't do anything new, it's feels almost like a recycled game, like you did all this before only it was fun the first time around. Thankfully the game is extremely short so your pain won't last long and you can safely uninstall this and go back the playing the various superior mods for Half-Life, both single- and multi-player.Perhaps the only redeeming quality is the high definition models pack that comes bundled with Blue Shift that gives the game a little a extra. However it should be noted that Half-Life can look much prettier than even that, you just have to play maps and mods that weren't made by Valve.			"

Much like Portal it's juuus long enough to be fun but not so long that the areas start to drag on or feel padded. The challenge is ramped up due to the simple fact that barney has limited armor... no HEV, PCV charging or energy packs for you... just whatever you can strip off the corpses of your comrades. It adds a layer of tension.The Bad:* Fewer WeaponsThis is about the only con and it makes sense.Barney is conf9ned to the more mundane weaponry.... but again this feels right.All in all a great addition that does better than opposing force at expanding. opposing Force while good suffered from trying too hard .. Blue Shift is confident enought in what it offers that it doesn't need to throw much in.			"

												I had actually never played this before, so this one was all-new to me. This is the other spin-off game that Gearbox made from the original Half-Life. This time, you play as one of the security guards at Black Mesa: specifically Barney Calhoun, whom you meet and shoot people with in Half-Life 2. So here's his story about how he managed to get out of there alive.The only real new thing is that since Barney wears ""body armor"" and not ""power armor"", you get your armor upgrades via scraps on the ground rather than the energy charger cells or those charger stations on the walls. Beyond that, there's little to nothing new here. The number of weapons is the smallest of any Half-Life game, and there are none that are new. You are pretty much exclusively using ""conventional"" weapons like pistols, shotguns, and grenades.This is also even shorter than Opposing Force. Took me 2.5 hours without ever having played this before. That's... rather sad.Anyway, this one gets a no vote from me. It has even less stuff than the game it's based off of, and doesn't have any cool new elements like Opposing Force did. I guess play it if you are *really* interested in finding out how Barney got out of Black Mesa, but beyond that... this isn't really worth it.			"

It has fairly good gameplay as well- until you get futher into the game. Tasks that were previously enjoyable become more of a chore as you have to complete them for the 5th time. There also seems to be no engaging story either- one of my favourite points of the series.Pros:Difficult challenges and gameplaySuspenseCons:Halflife, but blue			"

												When I read all the negative reviews, I thought: ""Hey, this can't be this bad. It's a Half-Life game after all.""I was so, so wrong.I'll start with the length - 2 hours and 40 minutes of gameplay. Ok, not bad for a expansion pack. Shame that Opposing Force is a lot longer and costs the same amount of money.Enemies jumping out at you are too predictable. They are more of a obstacle than a challenge here.When I enter a new area I think: ""Why am I here?"" or ""What's the point of this?"" instead of ""Wow, this is really cool.""Then there's the difficulty and health management - or rather the lack of it. Here, I run around with 100 hp and 50 armour on my first playthrough and 50%-100% ammo to all guns instead of the usual, average 70% health and no armour and striving to find more ammo. Here, Ammunition is just there for the sake od it. It's not a life-saver like in the original game. Same applies to health & armour stations/kits.The Hazard Course is not new. They literally took the identical thing from Half-Life and replaced the hologram. Where you originally first see a HEV charger, the pedastal with the arrow is still there as if they didn't even bother removing it.The only actually interesting thing is the level design of some stages, especially the Xen chapter, which is really cool, and you get to see new stuff.Oh, I almost forgot. This has  no new content. That's right. No new enemies or weapons here.			"

												Besides being short and not bringing nothing new to the table, it's still a fun game. You play as Barney Calhoon, a security guard at black mesa. I'm still suprised that Gearbox didn't make the protagnist talk but thats a just a nitpick.  Anyway if you played half life then the story is the same, but you just have a different point of view.  Later on you meet Dr. Rosenburg who helps you and the other scientists escape black mesa via portal.  At first when you escort Rosenburg, it may seem like a pain but when you get to the lab you start to befriend him.  The foes are still the same and yes, Xen is still a puzzle planet. So overall its a nice different point of view in the half life anthology. Although the game is short, you can explore the stages for easter eggs. So bottom line, if your a half life fan or want to get into half life then I recommend this very well done expansion			"

												Half-Life: Blue Shift.  I wish there was such a thing as a Blue Shift in the real world of work, seeing as a Blue Shift at Black Mesa only lasts 3 hours.  Now Half-Life and Half-Life: Opposing Force are not known for their lengthly storylines but one would come to expect a little more from an expansion to one of the greatest games of all time.Blue Shift places the player in the shoes of Black Mesa security officer Barney as he attempts to escape the Black Mesa science facility during the events of the original Half-Life; which run in parallel with the Blue Shift storyline.  Unfortunately the very limited script and lack of anything that could be considered an expansion of the original Half-Life experience means you will feel rather unsatisfied by the rather lacklustre ending to what feels like no more than a fan made mod.The only reason I can recommend for playing Blue Shift is to that you are granted an additional 3 hours of Half-Life gameplay, which can only be a good thing.2 subligars out of 5.

												I wrote this review when watching I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry on Afghan steaming service Sandflix.Barney Calhoun and Doctor Rosenberg are friends and Black Mesa employees.  Widower Barney, who still mourns the death of his wife Chell, is having problems changing the beneficiary on his insurance policy from Chell's name to his children's.  He is worried about his children's future if he were to be killed in the line of duty, and is contemplating quitting his job for something less risky, but he also does not want to forfeit his Black Mesa pension as he also see it as a safety net for his children.  Barney saves Rosenberg's life during the Black Mesa incident.  So when Rosenberg tells Barney that he owes him one, Barney takes him up on his offer.  Barney's favor: despite both being heterosexual, that they enter into a domestic partnership, in name and paper only, to provide that much needed protection for Barney's children.  Chronic womanizer Rosenborg reluctantly but eventually agrees.  The one person who knows for a certainty that they are both straight is their boss, G-Man.  Their plan hits a snag when Barney believes that they are being investigated by the pension department for possible fraud, which means that Rosenberg has to move in with him and his kids.  They consult the advice of a vortigaunt who adds an extra layer of complexity to the situation as Rosenberg in particular is attracted to aliens and believes it could be the one and only for him.  The vortigaunt's advice coupled with it wanting Rosenberg to be it's new best friend makes it even harder on him.Much like man with dwarfism, this game is short.  Also remind me of not so good Adam Sandler films.  Very sneeky.			"

												Half-Life: Blue Shift is the most disappointing thing since Mr. Plinkett's son. A Half-Life mod that I just can't stand. I was bored playing it because it was the same thing through the whole game, gross 1997 desert textures. There isn't very much variation in level design like there was in Half-Life. Blue Shift is very short, probably for the better. In the end, don't buy this game even if you are a Half-Life fan, which I am. ♥♥♥♥ this game.			"

												I know that I'm going to be hated for this but I don't like this game. It's really not worth it. The game tries little to nothing new or interesting. The story is about one of the security guards of Black Mesa, Barney Calhoun. If you've played Half Life 2, you probably remember the opening where a combine soldier takes you to an enclosed room and reveals to Gordon Freeman that he is one of your best friends. Ok, but that raises the question. If Barney is friends with Gordon then how come you only see Gordon Freeman in Blue Shift once or twice?The gameplay is exactly the same as the original Half-Life. The only difference is that you have fewer weapons than you did in Half-Life 1 and they're all typical weapons that you would find in virtually any FPS ever made and no interesting and or exotic weapons at all; assault rifle, shot gun, pistol, revolver, grenade, satchel charge, rocket launcher, and the  crowbar that was in the original Half-Life game. Oh, and let's not forget that you can't use HEV chargers to charge your armor and can make you take less damage, even though they're all over the game.The enemies are the exact same ones as in the original Half-Life. There are no new ones at all. There is a glitch in the game that made me pull every strand of hair out of my scalp. Right before the residence cascade from HL1, you have to enter an elevator with 2 scientists. Right before the residence cascade, the 2 scientists explode and you have to start over from the last checkpoint and you will go through that glitch again and again, until you start the entire game over.Overrall, this game is not one of the worst game ever, it's just not worth buying. I guess the only redeemable part about this game is the HD pack, which improves the textures, character models, and switches some of the weapon designs to the models from the PS2 port.			"

												Half-life: Blue Shift was a fun exspansion to Half-life but also kinda underwhelming compared to the last one Opposing ForcePros Playing through the events of the original game as a security guard is a pretty neat ideaIt was fun getting another chance to explore some more of Black Mesa before the resonance cascade Overall the level design was still pretty good can't say I ever got lost or comfused and there wasn't that much platforming this timeCons Unlike Opposing force this Exspansion dosen't implement any new ideas no new aliens or weaponsI think the campain should've been a little longerNot a fan of the HD weapons pack it looks odd and theres no option for the classic weaponsSo yeah not a whole lot to say since this is more or less the same as the previous games but less so if you liked Half-life and Opposing force you'll probably enjoy this to but I'd only recomend this game either through a pack or a sale mostly due to how short it isShort simple but still fun			"

												Half Life Blue Shift è una espansione del famoso gioco Half Life. Il gioco ci fa vivere la storia di Half Life da un'altro punto di vista , cioè metterci nei panni di un agente di sicurezza, Barney Calhoun , di Black Mesa. Giocare con un'altro protagonista è interessante , peccato che il gioco dura 3 -4 ore rispetto al classico Half Life che durava ben 15 ore ; inoltre non ci sono miglioramenti tecnici o comunque aggiunte (armi , nemici ecc. ecc.). Ma comunque è un dlc carino da giocare , grazie anche al suo prezzo ridotto di soli 3.99 euro.			"

												Having played the main story for the Half-Life series years ago, I wanted to play the lesser known Half-Life: Blue Shift.  After finishing it, I didn't find it as fun as I thought it would be but that's mostly because of bugs.  Now the bugs may actually be from the original Blue Shift, it may have came along with the steam port, or I'm simply too used to Valve's more recent games, but either way here are my complaints.- Pressing the use key ""E"" stops the player from moving, and pressing it repeatedly makes your character stutter.  If you miss grabbing an object and try to grab it again, you will stutter.- Pressing the use key on an object and pressing left or right launches the object at a high speed, sometimes dragging you along with it.- Whenever loading a saved game, attack is almost always on auto, so if you have a crowbard you'll keep swinging until you press attack again.  If you saved with your gun as your weapon, you'll autmatically be shooting when loaded.- Loading spots can sometimes be near an enemy, so if you're moving back and forth to shoot the enemy, you'll keep on loading and lagging.- Not necessarily a bug but there are some things that look like you can crouch jump onto but actually can't.When there are obstacles that involve moving objects around, it becomes kind of frustrating.  I guess the only directions you should use is just forwards and backwards when grabbing things.If you can get past over these it's not a bad game, but not that interesting either.  I would recommend if you're interseted in another perspective on the Black Mesa incident.			"

												This last DLC for Half-Life is of course not as good as the original, but it's sure is pretty sweet. In this case you see the story in the eyes of the guards of the Black Mesa facility. Opposing Force is more reccomended to play since it's larger, longer and a bit better. This one was really good as well but the buggy doctors which are ''following'' you (they mostly just stay where they are even if you asked them to move) and the same enemies all over again. It was not so challenging but surely not bad. It's worth playing, because after all: it's still Half-Life.			"

												I would like to suggest this game to you, but I have to be careful at the same time. Don't get me wrong, I like this game, but I'm a little conflicted. It has everything I love from Half-Life. the difficult puzzles, simple yet eloquent combat, come to think of it that might be the problem. It's too similar, nothing new really at all. If you want a continuation on Half-Life, which is why I purchased this, you won't be exactly disappointed, but not really impressed either. I did like the addition of getting armor from literal armor and the reticule reacting to being over the enemy, but all-in-all it never made me stop and say ""Wow, they put a whole lot of effort into designing these new mechanics!"". If, like me, you just wanted another run through of Black Mesa, feel free to purchase this, but if you are given the choice, go with Opposing Force.7.5/10+Still manages a nice story if not a little dull at times.+Keeps the good traits from the original.+Neat scenery as usual.+/- The protagonist being treated poorly by the scientists in the beginning of this story seems like it would be cool, but it ends very abruptly. However one could argue the story is him gaining their respect and becoming a hero. -No new weaponry.-Twists on gameplay rather mundane.-Fighting tends to be very far on the lackluster side.-Lack of enemy variety.-Ending is rather abrupt and isn't anywhere near as challenging to get to as the original.

												If you like the original Half Life, you'll also like Blue Shift.  It's a very similar game, with the same type of action and puzzles (and even the same weapons).  Many of the same enemies return as well, both from Xen and Marines.  If you haven't played the original Half Life, I'd recommend starting there instead.  Both have excellent gameplay, but you get more of the story in the original.I'd recommend Opposing Force over Blue Shift, however.  Both are the same price, but Opposing Force is about twice as long, and is also a much more innovative expansion, with interesting new weapons and levels that differ more from the original than Blue Shift's.  Blue Shift itsn't bad by any means, it just doesn't add new content to the series in the way Opposing Force does.			"

												This is the weakest of the half-life expansions BUT it has a very solid story along with the original. There are no new weapons or enemies. There are some cool puzzles though and the gun-play is still great. I'd get this with the bundle pack as I don't feel it's worth getting by itself.			"

												Half Life: Blue Shift is simple, short, and to the point. It's not some grandiose adventure that has you killing an alien mastermind, it's not you stopping an unlimited power from destroying mankind, it's just a guy running away from danger with a few allies. The mapping is solid, the combat is challenging, there are even a few secrets here and there, but I believe the best thing about this is that the levels set in Xen are extremely fun. Unlike in the original Half Life where they felt tacked on, or in Opposing Force where they were basically easter eggs. On a  less positive note, this expansion limits you to only nine weapons, but in a way, this is also a plus as it simplifies your equipment. Though, there goes the beegun, the gluon gun, the gauss cannon, etc etc. Another unsavory thing is that armor is rare; since you wear security armor you can only scavenge from fallen guards such as yourself, there's no suit recharging, which can leave you quite vulnerable.Besides one completely ridiculous puzzle (at least for me, that is), it is extremely fun and engaging. But be warned, this is the shortest Half-Life expansion, in fact, it doesn't even have multiplayer, so if you're looking for something a bit longer (or with multiplayer action) I'd recommend Opposing Force.

												I recommend this game, but only to diehard Half-Life fans, and even then, that may be a stretch. You see, Blue Shift is actually quite good, remaining synonymous with Half-Life, as far as core gameplay goes. That's just the thing, however -  in essence, this game is virtually part of Half-Life 1 reskinned with less weapons, less story, no significant substance added to the Half-Life universe, and only 6 hours max of gameplay in total. While worth the money, and technically in no way bad per se, compared to the original Half-Life, this game just falls short.But I'm not here to compare this game to HL1, am I? Nope, I'm here to tell you whether or not you should buy this game. So, I'll say this: if you felt that you couldn't get enough of the first Half-Life, then you won't regret purchasing this, the equivalent of a level pack, for five dollars, to get six more hours of Half-Life. Otherwise, look elsewhere; this game brings nothing new other than the maps.			"

												It's simply more of Halflife 1 but this time you play as Barney Calhoun who was a security guard in the original game who welcomed Gordon Freeman when he arrived to work, who later becomes one of the characters that appears in halflife 2. You play the day of the alien invasion from his perspective and the goal is to escape and survive the incident. Recommended if you didn't get enough fun from halfllfe1.			"

												Oooh boy, I was able to get this done in 3 hours but it's still worth playing! So you play as Barney Calhoun (Call-hoon), who, like everyone else, is trying to escape Black Mesa, with scientists! Barney is a security guard in his early days at Black Mesa, and helped Gordon get out of many sticky situations. I like the blue HUD that comes with this game though :3. (HINT: You can't charge from H.E.V chargers, you need to scavenge dead security guard armour or any you find!)			"

												Allright, time for a re-review.Blue Shift is the last of the side stories for the original Half-Life and once again it was made by Gearbox with help from Valve. But unlike Opposing Force, Valve decided on the story so we won't get any BS Race-X aliens. Anyway, this Side Story lets you play as Barney Calhoun. (The REAL one.)However, Unlike Gordon and Commander Shepard, G-Man doesn't do a damn thing and You're on your own for this one. So yes, this is the ONLY time in the Half Life series (As of this review) where you work for a happy ending and you GET a happy ending. (Until HL2, that is.)The weapons that you can use are way and i mean WAY fewer than HL or HL:OF BUT, with the console you can access HL's Weapon list.If you wanted to know Blue Shift's Weapons: (Crowbar, 9MM, Revolver, Shotgun, Rawket Lawnchair, Satchel Charge, Hand Grenade and the Snarks.) Not as much as Opposing Force, but let's be honest: We are only going to use the shotgun, aren't we?In all, if you wanted to have a quick stroll and look back through time to Black Mesa without the Slog-Fest of Opposing Force or don't want to go through the un-holy mess that is HL's Xen, I would go for this game.For PC and Sega Dreamcast, It's Half Life: Blue Shift released in June 12, 2001!PS: this game does NOT have the ""ACTION PACKED AMURRIKIA SAVES THE DAY BY KILLIN ALURRENS"" or the ""WHAT HAS SCIENCE DONE?!?!?!?!?"" style that the other two games have. You have been warned.			"

												A couple of years after that whole Opposing Force expansion, Blue Shift came out of nowhere with the prospect of a storyline involving one security guard of Black Mesa out of many, who bust out and help out in the middle of the crazy stuff that was unfolding in the middle of the resonance cascade during Freeman's own story.This is another Gearbox Software expansion pack, but this is where the similarity of opposing force ends.Blue Shift also included a ""HIGH DEFINITION PACK"" that could've been installed across the board with all the Half-Life products that overall improved the much needed quality of a 1998 game. I'm not sure if steam handle the whole thing it also applied to mods like Sven-Co-Op, which at the time, offered a better graphical quality that wasn't offered anywhere else.			"

												Half-Life: Blue Shift is essentially a DLC pack for the original Half-Life game.  However, it contains enough content and play-time, that is was launched standalone.Half-Life: Blue Shift puts you not in the shoes of the familiar Gordon Freeman from the original game itself, but instead in the shoes of one of the Black Mesa security guards.  You participate in your own adventure that parallels Freemans in the main game, with a few interwoven connections, but the story is truly unique.  You even have a similar run-in with the infamous G-Man as well.I would recommend this game to anyone who has played the original Half-Life game and is interested in the story of Black Mesa.			"

But why I ultimately enjoyed it is because of the story elements, and the cool nods to the original HL. It's quick enough to play through, but be aware that this is kind of buggy.

It's Half Life gameplay through and through and should be picked up by any fan though it should be last as it contains references to the other games and as stated it is the shortest of the three Original Trilogy Half Life's.

This game was unique because you got to play as a security guard, Barney Calhoun, rather than a scientist or a soldier this time around.

												Let me say, I thank the friend who gifted me the entire Half Life series. This, the original half life, and opposing force just seem so nicely aligned with each other. While it was short, it really isn't its own game, but rather Half Life in another person's perspective. What really is memorable in this game was when Barney goes through the portal one last time to get out of the facility, and one place he teleports is when Gordon Freeman gets captured by the military, with the exact same voice lines in the same exact cutscene in Half Life. Truly a must-buy, along with the rest of the Half Life series.			"

												This was an interesting game as you got to experience the Black Mesa incident from the perspective of Barney Calhoun, a Black Mesa security officer. If you don’t remember him, he was briefly seen in the beginning of the original game. If you've played Half-Life 2 already, but haven't played this expansion, it will show you how he made it out of there alive, not to mention a few other things that weren’t seen by Gordon Freeman. Although it's relatively short, it's a great game and has the same feeling as the original Half-Life.			"

Since no ""2015"" games run on this advanced office laptop, the Half-Life 1 series make a great substitute to it's Half-Life 2 counterparts. Blue shift is just great. Smooth running and great FPS. I highly advise you to buy this expansion pack. Uhhhh, when did the support for Windows XP end? Ah yeah, April 2014 well didn't effect me.....			"

												Half-Life: Blue Shift is the second expansion pack for Half-Life. You play as Black Mesa security guard Barney Calhoun and it’s a parallel story with Half-Life but short. It’s not that good and I’ll explain why. If you remember from my previous review, Half-Life: Opposing Force featured a decent amount of new content for Half-Life. Now this game is like the opposite were there is no new weapons, NPCs, or weapons but instead just a new 90 to 120 minute campaign just slapped onto the original Half-Life game. However this game does feature the new HD pack, where it basically takes existing models, weapons, and weapon sounds and replaces them with newer, better looking ones. This addon also can be used with the original Half-Life and expansion Opposing Force but that’s really not a big deal for this review. I also noticed that the HD models have washed out looking textures on them for some reason compared to when using them in other Half-Life games. As for the gameplay and everything, it’s really the exact same game but with recycled textures and new maps for the single-player campaign (no multiplayer included). For 2001 this game was just bland by this point especially with titles like Halo hitting the XBOX back in the day. However if you can pick-up this game cheap on steam then get it because it’s certainly not a bad game but nice to play through Half-Life again with a new campaign.			"

												Half-Life: Blue Shift is an amazing, linear game that has you shooting at zombies, headcrabs, headcrab-mounted zombies, and more as a Black Mesa security guard that had survived the horrible incident. The story couldn't be any more creative then it was back when this first game out, and it still warms my heart when I play it to this day. The graphics were a big upgrade back then, introducing all-new transparency to Source-Engine games, something thought impossible when game companies produced games. The style it was introduced in was phenominal, just a different path then just rushing the games out as in today's modern game. All of this is why this game DESERVES this final rating:+-+-+-+Score+-+-+-+Originality: 18 / 20Style: 19 / 20Story: 19 / 20Compatibility: 20 / 20Control: 19 / 20Total: 85 / 100 - 5 StarsI extremely recommend that you buy this game!

												Blue Shift is pretty good. The combat is pretty standard for Half-Life games with the same military and alien enemies as in the original. The weapons are limited somewhat though, without as many as in HL or Opposing Force. The story is ok, shining light on some background characters who could use a story. It's short though, between 3 and 5 hours probably. Overall I'd say keep an eye on this game if you like the other Half-Life games you've played. Once it goes on sale, it's a pretty good bargain.			"

												Half-Life: Blue Shift, the second expansion pack created by Gearbox to continue the Half-Life 1 storyline while Valve has been concentrating on Half-Life 2 once again surprise me going back to Xen one last time and exploring more parts to the story and setting of Half-Life as the final pc expansion pack to Half-Life 1 while Half-Life: Decay is originally a PS2 expansion pack to Half-Life 2.Once again, there one problem that Half-Life: Blue Shift such as story little bit shorter than its predecessors and while the rest does a amazing job as a true successor to Opposing Force.In the end, Gearbox did a good job on Half-Life: Blue Shift and deserves to have the score of 9.9/10.

												A short(relatively) sweet expansion at a little over 3 hours on my first playthrough on medium.  It doen't introduce anything new in weapons or enemies but it doesn't need to to tell it's story.  It's Half Life gameplay through and through and should be picked up by any fan though it should be last as it contains references to the other games and as stated it is the shortest of the three Original Trilogy Half Life's.  A good deal.			"

												I'm gonna be honest, I was confused who Barney was in HL2. He revealed himself and I thought ""... who exactly are you? Are you an enemy or not?"" Then I remember this game, Blue Shift. I remembered reading about this game and the character it spawned, so I paused HL2 for the moment and purchased Blue Shift. It was... decent to say the least. I think taking a character who didn't have a lick of screen time/potential story and making him the main character of his own spinoff is pretty hilarious. In a good way I might add. This game, however had a few really annoying glitches that almost ruined some aspects of the game for me. Everytime I would load after a death, the gun/weapon I was holding wouldn't stop shooting/attacking. While playing on hard mode, where I need every tiny bit of ammo I can get, made this much worse. Something I really love about this game was seeing Gordon at those random parts, those made the whole thing worth while. All and all, I really only recommend this game to fans of Half Life, if nothing else but to experience Barney's adventure.			"

												The original half life is my all-time favorite game. When I first played half life 2, I was disapointed because it was so different from the original (though dont get me wrong, still a great game.) That being said, Half Life Blue Shift and Opposing Forces are great games because they take place at the same time as thr original and are that same original style and setting. In Blue Shift you play as the security gaurd Barney Calhoun, working your way through Black Mesa, and fighting against aliens and the marines. You see things that you didn't see as Gordon Freeman, which is exciting. So even though it took place at the same time as Half Life, it is still its own game. It is very short but if you loved half life you have to get this game. I highly recommend it, but I would also point out that Opposing Forces was significantly more fun than Blue Shift.			"

You could easily finish this game in around 1.5 hours if you just wanted the story. That said Blue Shift is completely pointless and by far the worst of the entire half life series.

												Half-Life: Blue Shift is an expansion for the critically acclaimed Half-Life. In blue shift, you play as the security guard Barney Calhoun, who was present is the vanilla Half-Life, and the next games in the series. You see the story through his perspective, though the two games are rather similar. You get the same guns, same enemies same enviroments and similar challenges. In essence, this is basically a two-three hour version of Half-Life. It's definitely reccomended for the hardcore fans, but for anyone else it's hard to sell. You're paying for more Half-Life, and that's what you're getting. Blue Shift is kinda fun, but not neccesary to play in order to fully understand the story of the following games.Tl;dr:If you loved Half:Life and are craving for more gameplay that is very similar, buy it. If you're playing it for more story, progression of the main characters or variety in the set-in-stone Half-Life gameplay, Blue-Shift will dissapoint. AND DO NOT choose this as your first game to play in the Half:Life series! Play the original first, and then make the choice.			"

												I'm on the fence about recommending this one. It's really short, and compared to Opposing Force, which is pretty fantastic, Blue Shift really feels like a 3rd party mod (although I guess it was,[www.gearboxsoftware.com]heh). Something about the level design combined with the stock assets just makes a lot of the experience feel kind of meh. That's not to say it's all like that; it has a better ending than Opposing Force, and I would say the last part of the game as a whole is quite engaging. I enjoyed a lot of my time with this game, I think, but I was bored a lot of the time too. I think it's definitely something to get as part of a deal, rather than on it's own, so yeah.			"

												This review does NOT contain any plot spoilers. This was a great game for the Half-Life series.  For those of you who have high expectations from modern shooters, then you would be unsurprisingly dissapointed because of your adjusted standards.  This game was made with the original gold source engine back in the early 2000's in which it is apparent to what the engine can and cannot do.The game.  The game can be beaten in a time span of 2.5 to 3.5 hours and it includes the Hazard Course as a tutorial (recommended for adjusting settings before diving into the game.)  It is not long but it is an official story for Barney Calhoun during the Black Mesa Incident.  The gameplay is the same as Half-Life's gameplay except that there is a body armor mechanic that replaces the HEV suit.  The biggest problem in regards to HL: Blue Shift is the Gold Source engine's AI pathfinding issues.  AI characters (NPC's) will only follow you for a certain distance and have trouble going around corners thus making key NPC's frustrating to work with sometimes.  Also, there is no long-jump module.  Out of the 24 times that I've completed this game on the original disc, there were no notable bugs and/or glitches except for a spinning giblet that clips through the wall.			"

												Let me say, I thank the friend who gifted me the entire Half Life series. This, the original half life, and opposing force just seem so nicely aligned with each other. While it was short, it really isn't its own game, but rather Half Life in another person's perspective. What really is memorable in this game was when Barney goes through the portal one last time to get out of the facility, and one place he teleports is when Gordon Freeman gets captured by the military, with the exact same voice lines in the same exact cutscene in Half Life. Truly a must-buy, along with the rest of the Half Life series.			"

												If you're already getting this from the Half Life Anthology along with Half Life 1 and Opposing Force, you have little reason to read this but if you own Half Life 1 and Opposing Force but not yet Blue Shift, this is for you. I'm still listing this as a reccomendation, but Blue Shift is obviously the lesser of the three Half Life campaigns. Granted, it's still more Half Life, and it's a new campaign from the perspective of Barney, the security guard from Half Life 2 back when he worked at black mesa, but while it isn't as exciting or adds as many new things as Opposing Force, there is another problem you may not be aware of which is that Blue Shift doesn't seem to have recieved as rigerous patching as Half Life 1 and Opposing Force have, and as a result it's a tad buggier, looks a tad worse and honestly does feel a few versions back. Granted, it IS still more Half Life and if you beat Half Life 1 and Opposing Force's Campaigns and feel like you need more then this is right up your alley but otherwise it might be best to steer clear unless you're getting this in a pack.

If you've played Half-Life 2 already, but haven't played this expansion, it will show you how he made it out of there alive, not to mention a few other things that weren’t seen by Gordon Freeman.

												Definitely worth the $1.37 for 3.3hrs of entertainment, but I think the full price of $5.49 is a bit too much.This add-on felt to be overwhelmengly obsessed with the original Half-Life and plugging HL references all over the place, instead of developing the alternate point of view. The structure is also very similar to HL: you come to work, ZOMFG! accident, aliens, then soldiers, then you're on the alien world, you come back, and mess about with teleports while obviously being had by scientists.I think this add-on completely missed out on developing the alternate view point. It did absolute *nothing* to show you the HL events from a point of view of a security guard. You were just like Freeman, trying to GTFO from Black Mesa!Surely an armed security guard at a secret advanced research facility has some sort of protocol for such events that happened? Even the titles that flash at the start say equipment is first priority, personell is secondary, and personal life is of low priority, yet the only thing you're meant to care in the game is your own life.A great way to spin this add-on would've been to follow just that recipe: first you try to save some equipment but then realize it's a hopeless and stupid thing to do; we have to evacuate people! Whoever you're helping however are gunned right and left by soldiers and at the end, you're forced to abandon your job ethics, abandon your morals, and fight for your own life.After the first 5 minutes of the game, the only thing different from this and original HL is that you can't use H.E.V. chargers. Pathetic. I'm only giving a recommendation for the sake of nostalgy.			"

												A great old school , First person shooter , Valve did an amazing job on this , If you play other , well newer half life games , You will probably be wondering what black mesa is , ( From Barney , )This tells and explains what happens through a couple hours of great gameplay , and the old weapon a crowbar , just incase you wanna go Gordan Freeman on these miltary/alien things.To be honest , this is one of my favorite half life games . alot of weapons and a lot of challenges 10/10			"

												A fun, short game if you feel like more Half-Life. The one big letdown for me was the final battle. It was a bit anticlimactic, and I was mad I had been stockpiling all my ammo for nothing.I will say, however, that I love Barney. He's not trying to save the world, he's just trying to get the heck outta there. I feel like I understand him more than Gordon.			"

												The Freeman gets all the glory, and Alyx gets all the oggles, but if not for Barney, Gordon would have a one-way ticket to Nova Prospect and the Combine would be unopposed.  He is the unsung hero, the steadfast security guard just there to punch the clock for another day's pay.  For all the classic Half-Life fans, this tells the story of the Black Mesa incident from the perspective of Barney Calhoun.  Learn how he escaped Black Mesa with the handful of scientists that became instrumental in the events of Half-Life 2.			"

Since no ""2015"" games run on this advanced office laptop, the Half-Life 1 series make a great substitute to it's Half-Life 2 counterparts. Blue shift is just great. Smooth running and great FPS. I highly advise you to buy this expansion pack. Uhhhh, when did the support for Windows XP end? Ah yeah, April 2014 well didn't effect me.....			"

												Blue Shift is a good game for any Half-Life fans as addicted to Nintendo series. The game stars Barney Calhoun, the generic security guard. The content is not so new, though it boasted the HD pack while release. The Steam edition has it for owners of the game. Most content is taken straight from the original Half Life, making the graphics kind of dated. Only a few parts have all new content such as certain signs and objects introduced for the game. A new character is in the game, playing the role of a scientist. Enemies and guns are limited, with no super cool weapons that the first or second games had. The gametime is short, clocking in at 4 hours compared to HL's 11 and Op's 6 hours. The levels are nicely designed though they borrow heavily from the Half Life kind of levels with a systematic apparoach to the chapters. While the game has small bursts of ingenuity and fun ideas, it is not so original. That being said, this game is good for fans of Half Life looking for a quick HL game.			"

												Half-Life: Blue Shift is the second expansion pack for Half-Life. You play as Black Mesa security guard Barney Calhoun and it’s a parallel story with Half-Life but short. It’s not that good and I’ll explain why. If you remember from my previous review, Half-Life: Opposing Force featured a decent amount of new content for Half-Life. Now this game is like the opposite were there is no new weapons, NPCs, or weapons but instead just a new 90 to 120 minute campaign just slapped onto the original Half-Life game. However this game does feature the new HD pack, where it basically takes existing models, weapons, and weapon sounds and replaces them with newer, better looking ones. This addon also can be used with the original Half-Life and expansion Opposing Force but that’s really not a big deal for this review. I also noticed that the HD models have washed out looking textures on them for some reason compared to when using them in other Half-Life games. As for the gameplay and everything, it’s really the exact same game but with recycled textures and new maps for the single-player campaign (no multiplayer included). For 2001 this game was just bland by this point especially with titles like Halo hitting the XBOX back in the day. However if you can pick-up this game cheap on steam then get it because it’s certainly not a bad game but nice to play through Half-Life again with a new campaign.			"

												If you already played half-life or just didn't have enough money to get it at the time because you spent it all, this is a good alternative. Here, you play as Barney Calhoun, security guard from the Black Mesa incident, as you may of already figured by now. There isn't really any notable change in gameplay that I think I should mention, but one. Since you are a security guard, not a scientest ""Grunt""(Refers to the new scientest that they make to all the dirty work so that the others don't have to, A.K.A Gordan Freeman and his HEV suit), you will find that you can not use any of the HEV suit chargers found in the game. Instead, you have to find body armor, vests and helmets, often found by dead security guards lying around the facility. The armor works the same as the HEV suit, however. But, the game is only 3 hours long, as this is just an expansion to the original half-life.			"

												Blue Shift is an incredible expansion pack designed by Gearbox for the Original Half-Life game.This time you play as Barney Calhoun, a mid-ranking security guard in the top secret Black Mesa Research Facility. The game begins around the same time as Gordon’s adventure but ends sometime before that game’s story. The level design and story are both excellent, the latter more coherent than Valve’s original.Some may balk at the game’s relatively short running time (Around 4 hrs) but I found the plot pacing just fine.Again this game lacks pad support and for that it loses a mark. Also the visuals are somewhat dated.I give this game 8/10			"

												Definitely worth the $1.37 for 3.3hrs of entertainment, but I think the full price of $5.49 is a bit too much.This add-on felt to be overwhelmengly obsessed with the original Half-Life and plugging HL references all over the place, instead of developing the alternate point of view. The structure is also very similar to HL: you come to work, ZOMFG! accident, aliens, then soldiers, then you're on the alien world, you come back, and mess about with teleports while obviously being had by scientists.I think this add-on completely missed out on developing the alternate view point. It did absolute *nothing* to show you the HL events from a point of view of a security guard. You were just like Freeman, trying to GTFO from Black Mesa!Surely an armed security guard at a secret advanced research facility has some sort of protocol for such events that happened? Even the titles that flash at the start say equipment is first priority, personell is secondary, and personal life is of low priority, yet the only thing you're meant to care in the game is your own life.A great way to spin this add-on would've been to follow just that recipe: first you try to save some equipment but then realize it's a hopeless and stupid thing to do; we have to evacuate people! Whoever you're helping however are gunned right and left by soldiers and at the end, you're forced to abandon your job ethics, abandon your morals, and fight for your own life.After the first 5 minutes of the game, the only thing different from this and original HL is that you can't use H.E.V. chargers. Pathetic. I'm only giving a recommendation for the sake of nostalgy.			"

This void is host to exotic physical anomalies that are impossible in our own Universe and the asteroids that drift aimlessly through this alternate reality are home to incredible alien beings, taken from their native dimensions and left to coexist in the Border World. Suddenly, a mall cop shows up and pistol whips all the aliens.			"

It doen't introduce anything new in weapons or enemies but it doesn't need to to tell it's story.  It's Half Life gameplay through and through and should be picked up by any fan though it should be last as it contains references to the other games and as stated it is the shortest of the three Original Trilogy Half Life's.

												Let me say, I thank the friend who gifted me the entire Half Life series. This, the original half life, and opposing force just seem so nicely aligned with each other. While it was short, it really isn't its own game, but rather Half Life in another person's perspective. What really is memorable in this game was when Barney goes through the portal one last time to get out of the facility, and one place he teleports is when Gordon Freeman gets captured by the military, with the exact same voice lines in the same exact cutscene in Half Life. Truly a must-buy, along with the rest of the Half Life series.			"

												I ended this game with WAY TOO MUCH ammo left over when I played on medium, and that's saying something when you only get about 75% of the weapons from half life. The game is quite short with respect to Half Life, and it ends rather anti climactically. Worse, nothing that happens here is relevant to half life EXCEPT that Barney escapes.......But there's also rumors that this isn't actually the real barney. There was a piece cited by the Half life comic ""Concerned"" a long time ago that cites a different barney as the real barney.Anyway, if you're coming from HL or HLOF, play on hard. I died ONCE from combat.			"

												Blue Shift is a good game for any Half-Life fans as addicted to Nintendo series. The game stars Barney Calhoun, the generic security guard. The content is not so new, though it boasted the HD pack while release. The Steam edition has it for owners of the game. Most content is taken straight from the original Half Life, making the graphics kind of dated. Only a few parts have all new content such as certain signs and objects introduced for the game. A new character is in the game, playing the role of a scientist. Enemies and guns are limited, with no super cool weapons that the first or second games had. The gametime is short, clocking in at 4 hours compared to HL's 11 and Op's 6 hours. The levels are nicely designed though they borrow heavily from the Half Life kind of levels with a systematic apparoach to the chapters. While the game has small bursts of ingenuity and fun ideas, it is not so original. That being said, this game is good for fans of Half Life looking for a quick HL game.			"

The game begins around the same time as Gordon’s adventure but ends sometime before that game’s story. The level design and story are both excellent, the latter more coherent than Valve’s original.Some may balk at the game’s relatively short running time (Around 4 hrs) but I found the plot pacing just fine.Again this game lacks pad support and for that it loses a mark.

												This last DLC for Half-Life is of course not as good as the original, but it's sure is pretty sweet. In this case you see the story in the eyes of the guards of the Black Mesa facility. Opposing Force is more reccomended to play since it's larger, longer and a bit better. This one was really good as well but the buggy doctors which are ''following'' you (they mostly just stay where they are even if you asked them to move) and the same enemies all over again. It was not so challenging but surely not bad. It's worth playing, because after all: it's still Half-Life.			"

												Blue Shift seems to be the black sheep of the Half Life series. Sure, it's much shorter, and the gameplay isn't as fun and manic as it was in the original, or in Opposing Force. Hell, you don't even have access to all the weapons! But then, what did you expect? You're a security guard. Blue Shift wins bonus points for showing a more unusual side of the story, that of the scientists and guards stuck in Black Mesa, following the resonance cascade. The ultimate goal: get out alive.

												Calhoun?!, Holy Mackerel Blue shift totally shifted me yet again into Half-Life Universe once again. Playing as Calhoun is definetly a worthy ride because playing as this non-main-character within Half-Life put a different perspective of how Half-Life came to be today.Nevertheless playing through this wonderful game was worth it*. If your a person just starting out on this series i suggest playing Half Life first, Blue Shift second, and finally Opposing Force last. Calhoun sure did a good job at being a character, for without him the world would be in so much peril. I just hope there'll be a remake of this fantastic game soon, the constant crashing is very annoying to play-through. Yet as long as you are vigil and patient enough to clear this fantastic add-on into Half-Life, by all means play it. And <3 every aspect, gameplay, and even the sound of it.This is one game everyone Should* play...9.11/10GL & HF...			"

												Another entry to the Half-Life franchise, Blue Shift once again takes the player to Black Mesa. This game, although rather short, puts you in the shoes of Barney Calhoun, as he struggles to escape from the Black Mesa Research Facility, after his good ol' friend, Gordon Freeman, not only messed up the facility, but also asked him to pay for that beer he owed him.All joking aside, this game packs the same action as Half-Life and Opposing Force, although in a much shorter package. While some people have complained about its length, I think it's perfect, since making it longer wouldn't add much more to it. Highly recommended.			"

												Taking the same concept behind Opposing Force, Blue Shift showed the Black Mesa Incident through another set of eyes. This was a pretty weak expansion pack from a gameplay view as most of the cool guns were eschewed as the simple secutiry guard, Barney, never came in contant with any of them. It does provide some backstory of Barney for his involvement in Half-Life 2. It also is the first Half-Life game to have consistant interactions with another character, one Dr. Rosenberg.			"

												If you havn't gathered already from other people this game is very brief, 2.4 hours long in my case .  However it's really fun and gives you a little more about the main character Barney Calhoun. Only main difference I see (besides length) between this expansion and opposing force is you dont get nearly as many weapons and instead of charing up at HEV stations you only regain armor points by picking up the helmets and vests of your dead security guard comrades.

												Half Life: Blue Shift is simple, short, and to the point. It's not some grandiose adventure that has you killing an alien mastermind, it's not you stopping an unlimited power from destroying mankind, it's just a guy running away from danger with a few allies. The mapping is solid, the combat is challenging, there are even a few secrets here and there, but I believe the best thing about this is that the levels set in Xen are extremely fun. Unlike in the original Half Life where they felt tacked on, or in Opposing Force where they were basically easter eggs. On a  less positive note, this expansion limits you to only nine weapons, but in a way, this is also a plus as it simplifies your equipment. Though, there goes the beegun, the gluon gun, the gauss cannon, etc etc. Another unsavory thing is that armor is rare; since you wear security armor you can only scavenge from fallen guards such as yourself, there's no suit recharging, which can leave you quite vulnerable.Besides one completely ridiculous puzzle (at least for me, that is), it is extremely fun and engaging. But be warned, this is the shortest Half-Life expansion, in fact, it doesn't even have multiplayer, so if you're looking for something a bit longer (or with multiplayer action) I'd recommend Opposing Force.

												Saying if this game is better or worse than the other 2 Half-Lifes is a difficult task. I played all 3 approximately at the same time, and none differ mechanically in any way. They work the same.So the difference is in setting in length and here it's a good news/bad news situation. Good news is ; the storytelling and setting is significantly improved. Not that there was much higher HF could go in that respect, but you get to interact ever so briefly with NPCs in a way that lends them more personality and interacting with Dr. Rosenberg later on is actually well done. Bad news is, it's much shorter and not nearly as challenging. But since it comes with a bundle and is cheap as chips anyway, I recommend it as an added, well designed HF experience.			"

												I would like to suggest this game to you, but I have to be careful at the same time. Don't get me wrong, I like this game, but I'm a little conflicted. It has everything I love from Half-Life. the difficult puzzles, simple yet eloquent combat, come to think of it that might be the problem. It's too similar, nothing new really at all. If you want a continuation on Half-Life, which is why I purchased this, you won't be exactly disappointed, but not really impressed either. I did like the addition of getting armor from literal armor and the reticule reacting to being over the enemy, but all-in-all it never made me stop and say ""Wow, they put a whole lot of effort into designing these new mechanics!"". If, like me, you just wanted another run through of Black Mesa, feel free to purchase this, but if you are given the choice, go with Opposing Force.7.5/10+Still manages a nice story if not a little dull at times.+Keeps the good traits from the original.+Neat scenery as usual.+/- The protagonist being treated poorly by the scientists in the beginning of this story seems like it would be cool, but it ends very abruptly. However one could argue the story is him gaining their respect and becoming a hero. -No new weaponry.-Twists on gameplay rather mundane.-Fighting tends to be very far on the lackluster side.-Lack of enemy variety.-Ending is rather abrupt and isn't anywhere near as challenging to get to as the original.

												If you like the original Half Life, you'll also like Blue Shift.  It's a very similar game, with the same type of action and puzzles (and even the same weapons).  Many of the same enemies return as well, both from Xen and Marines.  If you haven't played the original Half Life, I'd recommend starting there instead.  Both have excellent gameplay, but you get more of the story in the original.I'd recommend Opposing Force over Blue Shift, however.  Both are the same price, but Opposing Force is about twice as long, and is also a much more innovative expansion, with interesting new weapons and levels that differ more from the original than Blue Shift's.  Blue Shift itsn't bad by any means, it just doesn't add new content to the series in the way Opposing Force does.			"

So it is the same game as Half-Life but your playing as Barny, also just don't look in thirdperson. ________________________________________________________________________________Textures: 10/10Npcs: 6/7Weapons: 60/60Total: 100/100____________________________________________________________________GOOD JOB VALVE!

												Having played the main story for the Half-Life series years ago, I wanted to play the lesser known Half-Life: Blue Shift.  After finishing it, I didn't find it as fun as I thought it would be but that's mostly because of bugs.  Now the bugs may actually be from the original Blue Shift, it may have came along with the steam port, or I'm simply too used to Valve's more recent games, but either way here are my complaints.- Pressing the use key ""E"" stops the player from moving, and pressing it repeatedly makes your character stutter.  If you miss grabbing an object and try to grab it again, you will stutter.- Pressing the use key on an object and pressing left or right launches the object at a high speed, sometimes dragging you along with it.- Whenever loading a saved game, attack is almost always on auto, so if you have a crowbard you'll keep swinging until you press attack again.  If you saved with your gun as your weapon, you'll autmatically be shooting when loaded.- Loading spots can sometimes be near an enemy, so if you're moving back and forth to shoot the enemy, you'll keep on loading and lagging.- Not necessarily a bug but there are some things that look like you can crouch jump onto but actually can't.When there are obstacles that involve moving objects around, it becomes kind of frustrating.  I guess the only directions you should use is just forwards and backwards when grabbing things.If you can get past over these it's not a bad game, but not that interesting either.  I would recommend if you're interseted in another perspective on the Black Mesa incident.			"

												Blue Shift is a good addition to the original Half Life, but not as good as Opposing Forces.With roughly 5 hours to finish, Blue Shift shifts the player (get it?) to Barney Calhoun as the Black Mesa Incident unfolds and shows a security guard's point of view. As far the gameplay goes, it felt a little bit of short in content since it doesn't have any memorable puzzles or plataforms sequence.But still is pretty cool and always welcome to play through the incident with a different point of view and sometimes get to see Gordon leads as he advances.Get it if you love Half Life, but don't expect anything epic.

This void is host to exotic physical anomalies that are impossible in our own Universe and the asteroids that drift aimlessly through this alternate reality are home to incredible alien beings, taken from their native dimensions and left to coexist in the Border World. Suddenly, a mall cop shows up and pistol whips all the aliens.			"

												the controls, graphics, voice acting, audio, and game play are fantastic , the story and variety however is very limited, after playing opposing force i expected this one to top this one with new aliens and weapons and more awsome parts of the facillity like opposing force. blue shift dissapointed me in those aspects but its still a good game. its still nice to see the security side of the story. not my favorite of the series but still recommended			"

												I Love this expansion but honestly compared to opposing force which introduced new weapons like the LMG into the mix. Opposing force also had you playing as a soldier named Adrian Shepard who is trying to shut down the mess just as Gordan is too it Shepard even interacts with the G-man. In blue shift Barney's impact on the story is very minimal plus no new weapons are introduced so overall it's a good side story but nothing compared to opposing force.			"

												This is a nice little addon campaign if you already enjoyed Half-Life 1. Pretty much, you play the game through the eyes of one of the secrutiy guards (yeah?). It fleshes out some of the backstory of Barney Calhoun and contains more of the classic Half-Life gameplay (environmental hazards, crawling through ducts with headcrabs, etc.). However, it is rather short and doesn't innovate much from the base game...the enimes are the same and some show up rarely (zombies) or not at all (black ops soldiers) and it often seems like a  simple rehash. There are few memorable things.The other addon, Opposing Force, was much better made and adds new content. Also, honestly Calhoun just seems too much of a bit player (the game even seems to reinforce this...the one time you see the G-Man, he ignores him...lol).However, if you are a Half-Life fan this will keep you entertained for at least 8-10 hours (on hard difficutly, probably less on others) and is at least worth picking up on sale. 7/10			"

												Half-Life: Blue Shift is an expansion for the critically acclaimed Half-Life. In blue shift, you play as the security guard Barney Calhoun, who was present is the vanilla Half-Life, and the next games in the series. You see the story through his perspective, though the two games are rather similar. You get the same guns, same enemies same enviroments and similar challenges. In essence, this is basically a two-three hour version of Half-Life. It's definitely reccomended for the hardcore fans, but for anyone else it's hard to sell. You're paying for more Half-Life, and that's what you're getting. Blue Shift is kinda fun, but not neccesary to play in order to fully understand the story of the following games.Tl;dr:If you loved Half:Life and are craving for more gameplay that is very similar, buy it. If you're playing it for more story, progression of the main characters or variety in the set-in-stone Half-Life gameplay, Blue-Shift will dissapoint. AND DO NOT choose this as your first game to play in the Half:Life series! Play the original first, and then make the choice.			"

												Half-Life: Blue Shift feels like a bit of a disappointment after the amazing job Gearbox did with Opposing Force, however it is still a fun game and well worth playing if you like the Half-Life games. The main problem with Blue Shift is its length. It only takes about 3 hours to complete which is disappointing considering how Opposing Force was around 8 hours long. It also isn't as unique or original as Opposing Force was.However despite its flaws the experience is still a fun one. Seeing how Barney Calhoun escaped Black Mesa is interesting if you have played Half-Life 2. Gordon Freeman can be spotted throughout the game which ties it quite nicely with the original. There are some really great puzzle sections as well which really require you to think. The gameplay is very good just like in the other Half-Life games.Overall, a great game let down mainly by its short length. Worth playing if you are a fan of the franchise.			"

												Half-Life: Blue Shift is an amazing, linear game that has you shooting at zombies, headcrabs, headcrab-mounted zombies, and more as a Black Mesa security guard that had survived the horrible incident. The story couldn't be any more creative then it was back when this first game out, and it still warms my heart when I play it to this day. The graphics were a big upgrade back then, introducing all-new transparency to Source-Engine games, something thought impossible when game companies produced games. The style it was introduced in was phenominal, just a different path then just rushing the games out as in today's modern game. All of this is why this game DESERVES this final rating:+-+-+-+Score+-+-+-+Originality: 18 / 20Style: 19 / 20Story: 19 / 20Compatibility: 20 / 20Control: 19 / 20Total: 85 / 100 - 5 StarsI extremely recommend that you buy this game!

												The standard-issue guard uniform (given to every single guard, even Otis) probably uses similar technology to the HEV suit according to this game. Either that, or Barney is a god trapped in a human's body, using his divine powers to soften bullet damage and sustain peak physical performance regardless of non-lethal injuries.He does his own thing without the G-man's help, so maybe.If this would be your first exposure to the series, get the regular Half-Life instead.

												It's an expansion for Half-Life where you play a different character, with a slight emphasis on platform puzzles and dark areas. Although it came out afterwards, since it's short and actually ends in the middle of the main game's story, I recommend playing Blue Shift first before Opposing Force. Not a lot of unique mechanics, but still offers the same old good stuff. Is it worth your time? If you like Half-Life, yeah, it definitely is.			"

												Half-Life: Blue Shift is similar to the episodic expansions for Half-Life 2, but in this case it Blue Shift expands of the world of the first Half-Life. Blue Shift has you play as Barney Calhoun, a security gaurd at Black Mesa who gets caught up in the events of the resonance cascade. The objective is the same as in the Half-Life main game, and that is to escape the horrible mess that you are entangled in. The graphics of the game are dated, but are not hard to look at, in fact I would say they give the game a charm to it. The game plays identically to the original Half-Life with no real new gameplay changes; same weapons, and same enemies. There are however a few new textures and characters that are part of the overarching Half-Life story. Blue Shift is an overall great experience that is a must have if you are trying to learn everything about the Half-Life universe.			"

												Half-Life: Blue Shift is the shortest of the two expansions for Half-Life that provides the back story of Barney Calhoun as he fights to escape Black Mesa with other science personnel.  Players may recall Barney's role in Half-Life 2 and in the case of Blue Shift, it felt nice to view the events of Half-Life through a different lense, just as in Oposing Force.  That being said, the game is indeed short and does not really introduce anything new in terms of weapons or gameplay compared to Half-Life.  The only major gameplay difference is that Barney cannot use the H.E.V. charging stations and instead must collect armor vests and helmets (actually a nice throwback to older shooters).  You'll go back to Xen for a short mission but most of the time you will be working your way through Black Mesa resuing scientists.  There are a few nods to other games in the Half-Life timeline too scattered throughout Barney's journey.  For the price and length of the game, I'd recommend getting this on a sale if you enjoyed Half-Life and want more lore.			"

												(English)Fearless COP !Not the best but not the worst addition. The story tells us about an interesting character Barney, that need to keep control of Black Mesa and to serve the law. The main goal is to escape Black Mesa, but not only you alone but also professors whom you will help to get together from this terrible place. Plot points reveal bits and pieces, and would like more. Not quite what I was expecting, but it turned out medium. No changes there, except that now your life, etc. are shown with blue color, and of texture can drop have done better and not the fact. This is not watched, but the faces of the characters look like as realistic. Unfortunately this Supplement the short of all that upsetting. Even more upset that the boss is at the end of the game, and indeed they are not. The ending was very easy when compared with OF. But still have to go, if you want to know more who is this Barney. Because many started playing HL is the second part of the game and asked the questions: ""Who is this ?"",""From where is he ?"". Beer 7 out of 10.(Русский)Бесстрашный коп !Не самое лучшее, но и не самое худшее дополнение. Сюжет рассказывает нам про интересного персонажа Барни, которому нужно держать контроль в Чёрной Мезе и служить закону. Главная цель сбежать с Чёрной Мезы, но и не только вам одному, но и профессорам которым вы будете помогать что бы свалить всем вместе с этого страшного места. Сюжетные моменты раскрывают обрывками, а хотелось бы побольше. Не совсем то чего я ожидал, но получилось средне. Изменений никаких нет, разве что теперь ваши жизни и т.д. показываются синим цветом, ну и текстуры может каплю сделали получше и то не факт. К этому не присматривался, но лица персонажей выглядят вроде бы как реалистичнее. К сожалению это дополнение самое короткое из всех, что огорчает. Еще больше всего расстроило то что босса нет в конце игры, да и вообще их нет. Концовка получилась очень легкой если сравнить с OF. Но все же пройти надо, если вы хотите узнать поподробнее кто такой Барни. Ибо многие начинали играть в HL именно со второй части игры и задавали вопросы: ""Кто же это ?"",""От куда он ?"". 7 пива из 10.			"

There aren't any new NPCs, no new weapons, the HD Pack was outlawed by Valve (Ironically enough, Opposing Force and this game weren't), it's basically a shortened Half-Life with a few different skins. It also has no online mode, but I think we can all see why. Only for the most dedicated HL fan, otherwise go play Opposing Force or wait for its sequel (You know who you are).			"

This game takes about 3 hours, give or take a few, to complete and is speedrun-able after beating the game once or twice.

												Half-Life: Blue Shift is an expansion that was to be exclusive to the cancelled Dreamcast port of the original Half-Life. That game was cancelled, but the game lives on, with HD textures, and a third narrative to the Black Mesa Incident. This time, you are everyones favorite security officer and beer-ower, Barney Calhoun. While the weapons are the same, with a few left out, you do get another oppertunity to gun down hordes of Xen aliens and marine soldiers. It's a cheap game, so you should pick it up if you crave Half-Life, or it goes on sale. Seriously, I got it for $1.24 in a sale, and it was worth it.EDIT: Forgot to mention a couple things. One, the game is a lot more puzzle based than the others. Two, the game is much shorter than the others, with no real end boss either.			"

												Half-Life: Blue Shift feels like a bit of a disappointment after the amazing job Gearbox did with Opposing Force, however it is still a fun game and well worth playing if you like the Half-Life games. The main problem with Blue Shift is its length. It only takes about 3 hours to complete which is disappointing considering how Opposing Force was around 8 hours long. It also isn't as unique or original as Opposing Force was.However despite its flaws the experience is still a fun one. Seeing how Barney Calhoun escaped Black Mesa is interesting if you have played Half-Life 2. Gordon Freeman can be spotted throughout the game which ties it quite nicely with the original. There are some really great puzzle sections as well which really require you to think. The gameplay is very good just like in the other Half-Life games.Overall, a great game let down mainly by its short length. Worth playing if you are a fan of the franchise.			"

												I Love this expansion but honestly compared to opposing force which introduced new weapons like the LMG into the mix. Opposing force also had you playing as a soldier named Adrian Shepard who is trying to shut down the mess just as Gordan is too it Shepard even interacts with the G-man. In blue shift Barney's impact on the story is very minimal plus no new weapons are introduced so overall it's a good side story but nothing compared to opposing force.			"

												When I first played this game, I had never played the original Half Life. I know, that's weird, but this was my introduction. That's probably the reason why i liked this game more than most. In Half Life: Blue Shift, you follow Barey Calhoun througfh the events of the Black Mesa incident chronicled in Half Life. The gameplay is incredibly fun with fast and fun shoot outs with aliens and marines alike. On the topic of gameplay, the physics in this game are a bit off. Everything feels a bit to floaty for my liking. The graphics, in my opinion, still hold up today. The textures aren't overly deatailed and nothing looks amazing. But the graphics are just fine.It's said that this game is too short, with an average overall playthrough lasting 2 hours. But if you're me, the game lasts for six hours. Overall, Half Life Blue Shift is a perfectly fun game, especially if you play it not thinking about how it holds up to the original Half Life.			"

												Oh well. After Playing through Blue Shift on Hard difficulty I have to say that I can understand the criticism this game got. But after all it was a really good ... little campaign. I think the points of criticism (no new Weapons, no Endboss, no new Enemies etc.) are valid considering the original Half Life and its quality. But surprisingly enough these points seemed very fitting to me. I mean after all we aren't the Hero of the story. We are nothing special at all. We are just a security officer that tries to get the hell out of the catastrophy he got into. Why should he use some super powered Weapons ? He uses what he can find. Why should he beat a giant Alien or Endboss ? He is simply trying to get away, not trying to save the world (like Rosenberg pointed out during the Elevator Scene). Other than that I have to say that I found the atmosphere to be really amazing. I felt like a confused lonely surviver trying to stay alive running for his life. All these dark coridors and the environment crumbling away. Electricity shooting out of walls and stuff like that. The biggest personal point of criticism for me is that it only took me 4 hours to complete the campaign on the hardest difficulty. Ultimately, if you enjoy the Half Life Universe I can recommend you to play it. Its short, its atmospheric, its intense.			"

												A decent edition to the Half-Life franchise, this game doesn't add a whole lot new to Half-Life as a whole, but it's still a decent play, so here are some pros and cons. Just like Opposing Force, any pros and cons Half-Life has, Blue Shift has.Pros-No special armor/shielding system, you aren't a scientist or soldier, just a squishy security guard. This mixes things up a bit if you've played Half-Life and Opposing Force.-Storyline running parallel to Gordon Freeman and John Shepard's.Cons-Shorter storyline than both Half-Life and Opposing Force.-No new enemies or weapons that I can think of.So obviously more of a redo of Half-Life with little variation for those of you who've played it . I'd still recommend it because it is enjoyable and gives you the feeling of playing Half-Life without having to repeat Half-Life. That being said, given its smaller, less varied nature, it's understandable if you don't get this game.			"

But do keep in mind that it is still Half-Life and it is still fantastic. I feel like we get all caught up in the majesty of its predecessors that we miss out on what it is. I actually reccomend playing it before you try out Opposing Force because it seems to fit in better and it makes Opposing Force shine brighter, but also because it helps build the story of the original games and it makes everything sort-of fall into place.Despite its reputation in the franchise, it is still quite fun and worth a playthrough.

												Half-Life: Blue Shift is the shortest of the two expansions for Half-Life that provides the back story of Barney Calhoun as he fights to escape Black Mesa with other science personnel.  Players may recall Barney's role in Half-Life 2 and in the case of Blue Shift, it felt nice to view the events of Half-Life through a different lense, just as in Oposing Force.  That being said, the game is indeed short and does not really introduce anything new in terms of weapons or gameplay compared to Half-Life.  The only major gameplay difference is that Barney cannot use the H.E.V. charging stations and instead must collect armor vests and helmets (actually a nice throwback to older shooters).  You'll go back to Xen for a short mission but most of the time you will be working your way through Black Mesa resuing scientists.  There are a few nods to other games in the Half-Life timeline too scattered throughout Barney's journey.  For the price and length of the game, I'd recommend getting this on a sale if you enjoyed Half-Life and want more lore.			"

												The second “interquel” to Half-Life is lived through the eyes of Barney Calhoun, a security officer at Black Mesa, that is seen by Gordon Freeman at the very beginning of the game. This game also takes place at the same time as Half-Life, but starts before the incident and is chronologically placed prior to Opposing Force. Barney’s journey through Black Mesa isn’t an easy one, but surely it is a short one, as Blue Shift is even shorter than Opposing Force. Also, the game doesn’t add any major improvements over other games in the series, and is thus to be considered just another expansion of the story. A really nice one at that, at it deserves a playthrough for sure, but the story will be over very soon. Unfortunately.			"

												Half-Life Blue Shift is a fun game. It does have problems though. Compared to Half-Life 1 and Opposing Force, this is the least good out of the three. It didn't introduce any new enemies or guns. It also didn't really have any awesome boss fights like the other two before it. The storyline isn't nearly as in depth or good as HL1 or OF. The game is SIGNIFICANTLY shorter than HL1 and OF. Nothing really new came out of the game. I feel that the makers of the game could've done a way better job. However, since I am a big Half-Life fan, I do think this game is fun to play. There are moments where the combat is intense. I would say it's a nice little game to play and finish in one weekend. It was worth the 99 cents I payed in the summer sale. If you're a Half-Life fan, you at least owe it to yourself and the series to pick up the game and play it.			"

And there are some challenges along the way but you get passed them with ease. This is a good game. Very Good game.			"

												This game is a side-story to Half Life. If you didn't play Half Life, you'll have basically no idea what's going on. But if you did, and you liked it, you will like this too. It has the same style puzzles and gameplay as Half Life, but it's a new story, where you play as a security guard in Black Mesa, and then all the aliens appear and you have to fight them and escape the facility. It's the story of Black Mesa through another characters eyes. It shows what happened to other people during the accident, and what happened to many of the scientists.TLDR: If you liked Half Life, it's an fun side story. If you didn't, don't get this.			"

												If you liked the original Half-Life (and how could you not?) then you will most likely also enjoy this expansion pack. It is the second Half-Life expansion, following Opposing Force, and while not bringing any new innovations it is very well executed. It is significantly shorter (~4h of playtime) than the original but well paced.			"

												Taking the same concept behind Opposing Force, Blue Shift showed the Black Mesa Incident through another set of eyes. This was a pretty weak expansion pack from a gameplay view as most of the cool guns were eschewed as the simple secutiry guard, Barney, never came in contant with any of them. It does provide some backstory of Barney for his involvement in Half-Life 2. It also is the first Half-Life game to have consistant interactions with another character, one Dr. Rosenberg.			"

												This is a nice little addon campaign if you already enjoyed Half-Life 1. Pretty much, you play the game through the eyes of one of the secrutiy guards (yeah?). It fleshes out some of the backstory of Barney Calhoun and contains more of the classic Half-Life gameplay (environmental hazards, crawling through ducts with headcrabs, etc.). However, it is rather short and doesn't innovate much from the base game...the enimes are the same and some show up rarely (zombies) or not at all (black ops soldiers) and it often seems like a  simple rehash. There are few memorable things.The other addon, Opposing Force, was much better made and adds new content. Also, honestly Calhoun just seems too much of a bit player (the game even seems to reinforce this...the one time you see the G-Man, he ignores him...lol).However, if you are a Half-Life fan this will keep you entertained for at least 8-10 hours (on hard difficutly, probably less on others) and is at least worth picking up on sale. 7/10			"

												Half-Life: Blue Shift is a very short game and can take you a maximum of 3 hours. That's how long it took for me at least, others say that it took them about 2 hours to be the game. It's as short as MGSV: Ground Zeroes, but doesn't mean that I didn't have with this game. On the contrary, I enjoyed it for what it was.GAMEPLAY!The game plays just like Half-Life 1 and Opposing Force (no big surprise, honestly), but instead of the HEV or PCV suit from the other games, you have your security guard helmet and vest as the armor you got. You can't use the Health or Shield regeneration station, instead you must find pick up dropped helmets and vests from dead security guards. It makes sense as in the other games, the security guards never really seem to be wearing any special suits like the HEV or PCV.There is no new weapons in this game, all you have is the standard military weapons from the original game. There is also no new enemies to fight, you got the Vortiguants, Marines, Headcrabs, Barnacles, and Zombies. I pretty sure there were more enemies, but those are only ones I remember.Pretty much, this is like the original game except your a security guard.LORE!As I said, there are no new enemies so, you won't be seeing any new aliens or special black ops here like Opposing Force did. Instead, you will be fighting the traditional enemies from the base game. In terms of story, it answers some questions, such as how Barney got out of Black Mesa and how does the portals work. There not a lot of things here that is new here. VERDICT!Although, I really listed a lot of cons to the game that will turn people off. I'm still going to reccomend this for anyone who wants a little more insight on Black Mesa and the Security Team. It's definitely not a bad game, but it just lacks anything new. Still, I think people will find it pretty enjoyable.			"

												Short, lacking in new content but ultimately good and fun expansion to Half-Life.Xen once again sucks a bit, with a crawling maze and annoying platforming, but those are only short sections and the rest is fine.From a story perspective Blue Shift shows a bit more of how Black Mesa operates, and gives a little more history on the technology key to the HL story, but overall it is an unessential tale of a minor characters escape.

If you've played Half-Life 2 already, but haven't played this expansion, it will show you how he made it out of there alive, not to mention a few other things that weren’t seen by Gordon Freeman. Although it's relatively short, it's a great game and has the same feeling as the original Half-Life.			"

The whole game is played from the perspective of Calhoun, which was a soldier in the labs where it all started.Little short, but cheap and definitely a nice gaming experience.Also even though it came out after the Opposing Force DLC, I recommend playing this one first, since this one starts along with the original game, and ends off somewhere in the mid-game, while Opposing Force starts somewhere approximately in the mid-game and continues up until the very end.

												I'll put it simply. Half-life Blue Shift was visually impressive and had some cool scripting when it came out. Besides that though, it's largely a dissapointment. It's not that the game isn't fun, or doesn't have it's moments-it does- but it doesn't fill the standard that Half-life and HL:OpFor set. Besides the overall game time and plot both being lacking, it also shoots itself in the foot by not including as many weapons or enemies. Only about half the arsenal is included (no energy weapons, missing a couple explosives, and no Xen/Race X weapons). While I don't fault this game for leaving out the Race X creatures, I DO MISS the Xen creatures (and human enemies) that fail to show up. You don't get to fight any mutated zombies (OpFor), Icthysaurs (underwater things), boss enemies, black ops or assassins, and you only fight a handful of grunts and the flying mini-Nihilanth things. The game is still enjoyable, but it's not highly recommendable.  If you're a HL fan or just craving a decent shooter however, perhaps this may appease you. 6/10			"

It also has fixed all the A.i issues that were in HL1 and especially the horribly bad issues in Opposing Force.Blue Shift isn't filled with new things but it didn't need to be because it perfected the old things.FINAL GRADE: 8/10			"

												Oh well. After Playing through Blue Shift on Hard difficulty I have to say that I can understand the criticism this game got. But after all it was a really good ... little campaign. I think the points of criticism (no new Weapons, no Endboss, no new Enemies etc.) are valid considering the original Half Life and its quality. But surprisingly enough these points seemed very fitting to me. I mean after all we aren't the Hero of the story. We are nothing special at all. We are just a security officer that tries to get the hell out of the catastrophy he got into. Why should he use some super powered Weapons ? He uses what he can find. Why should he beat a giant Alien or Endboss ? He is simply trying to get away, not trying to save the world (like Rosenberg pointed out during the Elevator Scene). Other than that I have to say that I found the atmosphere to be really amazing. I felt like a confused lonely surviver trying to stay alive running for his life. All these dark coridors and the environment crumbling away. Electricity shooting out of walls and stuff like that. The biggest personal point of criticism for me is that it only took me 4 hours to complete the campaign on the hardest difficulty. Ultimately, if you enjoy the Half Life Universe I can recommend you to play it. Its short, its atmospheric, its intense.			"

												A decent edition to the Half-Life franchise, this game doesn't add a whole lot new to Half-Life as a whole, but it's still a decent play, so here are some pros and cons. Just like Opposing Force, any pros and cons Half-Life has, Blue Shift has.Pros-No special armor/shielding system, you aren't a scientist or soldier, just a squishy security guard. This mixes things up a bit if you've played Half-Life and Opposing Force.-Storyline running parallel to Gordon Freeman and John Shepard's.Cons-Shorter storyline than both Half-Life and Opposing Force.-No new enemies or weapons that I can think of.So obviously more of a redo of Half-Life with little variation for those of you who've played it . I'd still recommend it because it is enjoyable and gives you the feeling of playing Half-Life without having to repeat Half-Life. That being said, given its smaller, less varied nature, it's understandable if you don't get this game.			"

												An excellent side story of the Black Mesa Incident, involving Gordon Freeman's close security guard friend, Barney Calhoun. It's a rather short game, but is full of story and cool battles.P.S. Barney is great.			"

												Not the best part of the Half-Life series, in fact, it is the worst. But being the worst part of Half-Life is still doing damn good.  It is the worst mostly because of the story elements. If you love the core of the Half-Life gameplay, this is just more of what you love. I personally had a blast playing it. Certainly a reccomend.			"

												Half-Life: Blue Shift is the second expansion pack to the original Half-Life. You play from the point of view of a Black Mesa security guard. The events in this game run parallel to Half-Life and Opposing Force. This expansion is the much shorter than Opposing Force, however it's still fun even though there are no new weapons or enemies introduced. The game in parts seem similar to Gordon Freeman's route to work. For Half-Life fans this expansion is great in offering more gameplay and completing the Half-Life 1 storyline.			"

												This game is a side-story to Half Life. If you didn't play Half Life, you'll have basically no idea what's going on. But if you did, and you liked it, you will like this too. It has the same style puzzles and gameplay as Half Life, but it's a new story, where you play as a security guard in Black Mesa, and then all the aliens appear and you have to fight them and escape the facility. It's the story of Black Mesa through another characters eyes. It shows what happened to other people during the accident, and what happened to many of the scientists.TLDR: If you liked Half Life, it's an fun side story. If you didn't, don't get this.			"

												While it may not add new weapons (it actually subtracts a few), and is shorter than both the main game and it's brother OP4, Blue Shift is still worth it. It has a good story, and it also introduced the HD texture pack that enchances not only B.Shift, but Half Life and OP4 as well. And for it's time, it has a more satisfying ending then either. But I will avoid any spoilers and hope you will pick up the game instead.			"

Anyway TL:DR A GOOD game not a great one but a good one.Pros1 - Great music as ever2 - Same gameplay as Half-Life 1 and OpFor can't fault it3 - VAing is just as good as OpFor and HL14 - Pacing is FAR better than OpFor and HL1Cons1 - No new weapons unlike OpFor2 - Some of the puzzles are maddening3 - Tries to be different to different4 - Rosenburg (or what ever his name is) is impossible to get him to follow you "

Wether you're a scientist in a bright orange ♥♥♥ suit smashing Crowbars into the faces of Alien Monsters. Climbing slowly out of the hell of a hidden government facility. To a poor secuity guard blowing holes in military cover up soldiers trying to kill him when all he wants to do to is live a comfortable life. Or perhaps a Military Cover up agent stepping into something you have no idea off and fighting a new war you've never trained for. This game makes you feel like a badass and makes you feel like you actually get some where. I IMPLORE YOU to buy these games. Nothing but good things to say about these games.			"

												Blue Shift is a very short expansion pack for Half Life 1 for a reason, and it is the fact that, unlike Opposing Force, it doesn't add anything too new to the game. The same weapons present in Half Life 1 are seen here, but the weapons that were in Opposing Force not being in this expansion pack is a mystery to me. I mean, at least the .357 pistol could be here since Otis uses it. Anyhow, it is short because Gearbox knew there was no point in trying to make it as long as Opposing Force since there wasn't much new content aside from yet another view of the Black Mesa incident from a security guard's eyes and a new scientist character that never appeared in any HL game after this one.Still, Blue Shift still feels like how a Half Life game should feel like. The feeling of loneliness is much more present here and I have to say the atmosphere is very immersive, just like in the original Half Life and Opposing Force. If you enjoyed Half Life 1, go ahead and play this one too for some extra 2 or 3 hours of Half Life experience as Barney Calhoun.			"

												This has always been my favourite of the three Half-Life games and I can't really put my finger on exactly why.I think it's the sense of realism. On your way to work, you see the outside of Black Mesa. You see your colleagues eating breakfast and getting their laundry. The door to your working section won't open. You go to a shooting gallery and a room with security cameras. You see the security guards' locker room. All the scientists have different personalities. All the small details in everyday life is here. Not to mention the elevator part. This is my favourite part in the whole series. It's terrifying and at the same time it feels more realistic than most things in the game, because it actually could happen in real life (except the aliens part, of course). What a way to start the game!The High Definition Pack was a nice addition in the original release as well, which deserves high points.The only things that bug me are the short length, the lack of new weapons and an overall grey mood that hangs over the game. It's hard to explain and I might be a minority on this, but the sense of fun in the first two games is lacking a bit. The over reliance on puzzles also makes the game seem more like hard work, rather than a pure fun action game. You really have to work for your survival, which is more realistic, but it's a little overkill here for me.I still love the game for its realism. However, in the end, there are more small problems with it than the first two, and with its short length, they are all the more noticeable. It may not be a great game, but it's still good, and even ""just good"" Half-Life games are a joy.I'd give it a 6,5/10. If you liked the first two, you should at least give it a chance. At the very least, it offers more variety.			"

												""Half-Life: Blue Shift"" is the second expansion pack for the acclaimed ""Half-Life"". Offering little new content, it is usually considered a lesser expansion pack than ""Half-Life: Opposing Force"" - and I've gotta say I understand this. There are no new weapons in ""Blue Shift"", and no new enemies. Still, it is a fun little game (it has a mere 8 chapters) with quite a lot of interesting easter eggs, a Gordon Freeman sighting near the very beginning and some interesting maps. And let's not forget that it is the first game in the Half-Life series to feature consistent interaction with a single non-player character. This character, as you may know, is Dr. Rosenberg. ""Blue Shift"" might not be the most exciting Half-Life game, but it sure is a fun and interesting experience, perhaps mostly for Half-Life geeks like myself.			"
