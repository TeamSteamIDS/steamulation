												Background:Purchased as part of a bundle from Bundle Stars. I played the first two games in the series to death back when they came out.Impressions:The game stands up today much as it did when it came out. It's a damn fine strategy game that's a blast to play and highly rewarding. However unlike it's predecessor this game is more of an expansion pack, with only 8 missions they instead ramped the difficulty to near frustrating levels.While still fun and rewarding for the most part I really started to detest the 'mansion kidnap', 'rail yard' and final mission for the sheer bloody minded difficulty of sections those missions where trail and error started to get irritating.There are some missteps for sure with elements that are seemingly only solvable in a single method and theres one right in the first mission that can leave you stranded just as you thought you were done and you have to go back a few saves or even start again.Fixes:As with Behind enemy lines there are a number of serious issues with the game on a modern PC that make it almost unplayable.See the page on the 'Commandos Wikia' for 'Commandos: Beyond the call of Duty Fixes' for a collection of bug fixes to stabilise the game and make it playable.http://commandos.wikia.com/wiki/Fixing_CommandosThe Good:*A classic formula that stands up today for it's simplicity and functions.*Missions can be tackled many ways.*The settings have a historical context and introduced as such.*Missions are huge and diverse.*Fast save/load system makes experimentation less frustrating than you'd think.*Huge sense of triumph from executing a plan that takes out even a single awkward guard.*Looks pretty good considering it's age.*New mechanics, some of which are interesting and alter your tactics.The Bad:*Installs ok on Steam but multi-core affinity issues requires some manual tweaking.*Many missions have sections where there is only one practical solution.*The difficulty level is a massive leap up upward over the original game.*A new character only appears in a single mission.*Cigarette packs effectively give everyone a Decoy box, messing with the balance.*Shorter tougher campaign.Recommended for: War, Action and isometric strategy fans and fans of the original.Conclusion.7/10. Once the stability issue is fixed it's a reasonable follow up to the original.			"

												I haven't really played this game when it first came out. At the time I didn't really grasp the difference between a sequel and an expansion, so I was disappointed at first when playing this for the first time. But if you loved ""Behind Enemy Lines"", then certainly get this game as well.

Short version: 83%Beyond the Call of Duty is like an expert mode for Behind Enemy Lines. There are only a handful missions, but they are all incredibly long and incredibly difficult. If you want a great and challenging game, look no further.Long version:Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty is a stand-alone expansion pack for the critically acclaimed classic isometric strategy/stealth game, Behind Enemy Lines.Like the base game, it features a group of commandos in eight scenarios, who must complete a set of objectives– mostly sabotage– deep inside enemy territory. Although all missions are loosely based on historical events, there is no actual plot, only short briefings.BtCoD is notorious even among old Commandos fans for its difficulty. The levels are not only gigantic– larger than the biggest one in BEL– but they are also full of enemies placed in the most nefarious ways possible.To combat this, all commandos received new abilities. Some are unique, some are universal: for example, anyone can now distract soldiers by throwing rocks, or lure them with cigarette packs.There is also a non-lethal way to deal with enemies now, letting you take hostages to use as distractions. On some levels it’s almost impossible to progress without using these “puppets”.The imbalance between characters wasn’t really addressed, since you still need to use the Green Beret or the Spy to silently kill or knock out, and to carry enemies. Therefore, the role of the others is mostly reduced to hostage controllers.Still, this difficulty is what made BtCoD more memorable, and probably even more loved than the original, which will seem way too easy and short in comparison. So, if you ever want to experience some difficult game that is not just another indie platformer, you can always rely on Pyro Studio’s classic.			"

												While it has fewer missions than Behind Enemy Lines each of Beyond the Call's missions is as big as the largest-size missions from BEL. Altogether I liked this game just as much as the first BUT the addition of several new abilities counteracts the added complexity of the longer missions. In fact, I feel they went too far and made the game too easy. These abilities have been granted to all characters: Puppet - Basically, the character holds an enemy soldier at gunpoint, allowing you to control the soldier. The soldier has one ability: Distract. This single ability allows any character to have a Spy-lite in their pocket at all times.  Stone - When thrown it causes all soldiers in earshot to look in the direction of the impact for a few seconds. If you instead use it to pelt a soldier several times directly he'll leave his post to investigate. Again, it just made things too easy. Cigarettes - Usually has to be salvaged from a dead soldier. When dropped within view of most enemy soldiers they'll leave their patrols/posts to pick up the pack and smoke them in a corner somewhere.All three of these abilities are usable by any character and it really takes away from the puzzle aspect of Commandos that I really loved. The Green Beret's Decoy's thunder has been stolen and split 3 ways and the Spy... while he's not rendered obsolete he's definitely not as indispensable as he used to be.  Character Ability   Green Beret Handcuffs - Pre-requisite to Puppeteering Fist - Pre-requisite to handcuffing   Driver Rifle - Basically, the pistol with 30% more range. It's unsilenced and therefore not very useful for most situations but it doesn't have limited ammo like the Sniper's rifle.Club - Same as the fist, but the Driver doesn't carry handcuffs so it's really only useful for a two-pronged attack when you want to quickly knock-out two soldiers in rapid succession.   Spy Hanger - Unlike BEL, the Spy's disguise duties are no longer super simple. Previously, he just had to worry about getting ahold of the officer's uniform and after that he was untouchable. In Beyond he can/must usually steal his uniform from handcuffed enemies. The easiest to obtain is the common soldier but officers are not fooled by this disguise. This difficulty is compounded by the fact that officers usually patrol with several machinegunners in tow and are therefore impossible to knockout and handcuff. (You can't steal uniforms from dead enemies.)Ether - Same as the fist, but again, only the Green Beret carries the handcuffs so you'll need him to finish up otherwise the enemy will wake up and sound the alarm shortly.  In conclusion, I liked Beyond but not as much as Behind. The mission designs are somewhat more complex but this is watered down too far by the new, shared abilities.			"

												The best part of all the series is that one can feel the WWII environment with roads paved with cobblestones, old buildings, rail lines, and tanks & guns. The graphics is excellent if one compares to games published during 1999. The game requires patience and sometimes tough to play, but at the end it gives immense satisfaction. Please note that its not a first-person-shooter game, but it gives a birds eye view to play the game with real time strategies.			"

												First Commandos game by Eidos and at that it is one of the best. Old school game w/ isometric camera.If you want difficulty, meticulously orchestrated plan to take down enemy, and hardcore gameplay, THIS is the game for you. Believe me when I say its hard...it IS very hard game. Though playing and killing enemies w/ perfect planning will give you immense satisfaction.Just keep in mind 2 things:- There are little bit of glitches when killing enemies...so try to take them out in small group, one group AT A TIME.- SAVE the game after each encounter. You don't know what will happen if you mess up your plan, because you will die a lot if you think running and gunning will get you far.In reality, this game tried to portray the hardcore situation of WWII. You won't regret it. Get it and play it.NOTE: You may be surprised to know that all commandos game share real life areas that you probably have seen in history channel or other historical photos!

												Compatibility settings people!Whilst the team porting this have done a superb job fixing the speed and saves, if you still have issues with it freezing / crashing - Try setting the conman_mp.exe file to run in Windows 95 compatibility mode (it's located in the game files) - Whilst you annoyingly have to validate this each time you want to play (it asks if you're ok with it making changes) this has given me 100% stability on this great game againThis game is ultimately an expansion pack for 'Behind Enemy Lines' - Giving you 8 new difficult (yet brilliant) missions. It also introduces a few deceptively simple, yet interesting, abilities. You can knock enemies unconscious (to gain control to distract other guards), divert with stones or lure with cigarettes (a particular favourite). Fortunately this doesn't detract from the ruthless difficulty that this game has thankfully retained. You're still left carefully studying enemy movements and scratching your head as you try to figure out the best approach - all without raising the dreaded alarm... that is, of course, until you get to blow the hell out of the place - Which still continues to be a satisfying sightQuite frankly, if you loved the first one then you'll have no reason not to like this one			"

This is not a problem from the game developer, as this is now a piece of software that is 20 years old.

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Strategy Stealth world war 2  game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere are some Resolution sizes.The Music and sound volume has a slidebar.You are able to turn off the Commando voices/Enviroment and in-game music,There is a manual/introduction in the game.There are no tutorials.Able to toggle ""ignore enemy soldier on halt"".Multiplayer requires IP and Port Forwarding. THIS STILL WORKS!About the game.You play with a couple of commandos and each commando has their own equipment and skills. The game is very difficult by itself and their is even a difficulty level settings too. Just if it is too easy. There are 8 mission/Maps and You have to complete each mission by fulfilling the subjective. Destroying things, to freeing, capturing and so go on. Enemy soldiers/vehicles has an eye of sight which is marked with Dark green and light green. Dark green means you have to crouch or otherwise the enemy unit will see you. Light green he spotted you and could fire on you. Your commandos are able to take hostage by enemy Sergeants (usually patrolling with units). There is a chance that they will rise alarm if they see you, if that happends. You might load game. Because things will get 10x harder if they have raised their alarm. Whenever a mission starts you will be told what you have to do and you get some hints too.Able to throw stones, throw cigarettes, capture and take enemy units hostage.Announcer that is giving you some tips and hints and what you need to do in order to complete the mission.Music is good.It has some old graphics but it's fine to be honest.Enemies could be difficult to see sometimes due the graphical background.You have a map on the right side and a hint next to the map.Alot of Error and trials.Multiple save slots. Which are needed!Each commando has their own Voice. But the voices are a bit meh in this version.Pathing is sometimes weird.Animations are sometimes slow.Other things.You could see this like a DLC for the First version. But this has only 8 missions has some new feature but most of all. Difficulty in this game is extremely higher. Sadly enough you are only able to play with the new characters in 1 mission.I have enjoyed it very much, some missions are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ but there are no mission the same. Sometimes a little bit of luck is required too.-------------------I Give this game a 8/10			"

Unlike the cracked version that I played years ago, which was 4:3 and kept crashing every 15-20 minutes, this one ran mostly fine (only got crashed and lost my quick save a couple of times) and supports 16:9. Highly recommended if you are still using Windows 7.			"

												This game is a classic, just like the commandos franchise (the three games). All of them are a must play.This game has fewer missions but they are longer than the ""Behind Enemy Lines"" (the maps are longer).If you like BEL, you will like BTCOD too.I give it a 7/10.			"

												If you are now playing on 16:9 or :10 screen resolution and using WindowsOS further than Win98, better not buy it. The devs seems too lazy to fix (or perhaps, recode) the game into HD (like AoE II did) or simply do something to make it playable in compatibility mode.Had to delete (or rename the extension) all of the clips in the videos folder or the game will end up in black screen and had to ctrl-alt-del.I love this classic game in my old days, but Steam successfully loot my money for my childhood impression and not deliver my expectancies.Don't buy this on Steam if you don't want to ruin your childhood memories.

												This game will KICK...YOUR..♥♥♥♥♥..And make you beg for more.The First mission is just brutal if you don't use new mechanics and even then, it takes crackerjack timing! Still I recomend it as a solid game, it may have some sound problems but it works as a whole. *Maybe get on that sound thing eh? Its mostly when it comes to the objectives*			"

 Quick Save randomly crashes in multiplayer This review is not about the game in itself, which, albeit rather short compared to the original, is still very good.But if you plan to play this game in coop with some friends, you need to be  warned about the multiple crashes in multiplayer/coop setting.  (we were using hamachi on windows 7 64)The game ended up crashing (for both of us) quite a bit while loading the quick-saves, meaning we'd have to restart a mission multiple times from scratch after a crash. It generally happened after dozens of quick loads so you still can finish missions but it was very annoying especially when you play in hard setting where you often have to reload tons of times.So this addon is quite unstable compared to Behind the Line and is better suited for solo than coop.

												I bought this along with the other Commandos games in a collection pack and just like the first Commandos game, this game runs WAY too fast on modern PCs. It is impossible to react to anything since everything moves too damn fast. Stealth is a must when you play this game, but since everything is in super speed, you won't be able to time it correctly when trying to avoid the enemies line of sight. If you are seen, they will kill you in the blink of a eye and all you can do is just start up a new game since you cannot even save or load your game! This game is one of those games where saving and loading on the fly is very important, but there is no way to do that for some unknown reason. What is even worse is that Steam is actually selling this game online without fixing it. Yea, it was not that expensive, but someone is still making a pretty penny off of this games sales. It is sad because this game is actually good, it's just these bugs that prevent it from being playable. The least they could do is patch it up or if all else fails, take it down the store. If the glitches were fixed, I would definitely recomend buying it.			"

												After completing the first game I was looking forward to knocking over this short expansion, it was short-lived however, after I ran into some completely and utterly ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ level design in the first mission.After having accomplished all mission objectives and getting ready to leave the island by boat I noticed there was still one more obstacle: mines blocking the path. Ok no problem I'll shoot these and blow them up... I can only destroy one of these by pistol, and I need to destroy two to get past and finish the mission.You have to save at least one of your snipers bullets to proceed, no where in the briefing does it hint at this, in all previous 20 missions of the first game a sniper was never 100% necessary to win, you only ever had to save bombs and this was obvious if you read the mission objectives.You would think one mine would destroy the next since they are almost touching, nope for some reason the usual explosive mechanics do not apply in this instance. Now I have to restart the mission, get ♥♥♥♥ed.			"

												Most of the time I'm up for a hard game, but this game is so unforgiven. With enemies that can see through objects and their field of view that moves way to fast, you'll see the game over screen over a lot. Restarting to the missions would be so bad if you didn't have to see all the pre-mission crap, sure you can press Esc a few to skip all of it, but still takes up time... On the first mission it took me a haft hour to get to land without everyone getting killed, just to find out you CAN'T save or load game. Grr. So, I did what all self-respecting gamers do, I looked up cheat codes. I'd just skip this game.			"

												Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty is an entire step in the wrong direction in regards to its predecessor. Sure this game now has music in the background which fixes my previous complaint on lack of sound in Behind Enemy Lines, but this expansion is 10x more frustrating than the core game. I love difficulty, I relish in it, but this game is just flat out dumb and unfair. Some mission requires a very specific way to win, so you’ll have every little room for strategic freedom. It has fewer missions, but it’ll take you way longer to clear a mission than in the previous game. I lost count how many times I rage quit from playing this game because I end up having no ammo/utilities to take care of a scenario because I used it all up earlier in the mission; this did not occur in the previous game. Unpredictable scripted events that are not viewable by simply scrolling around the map killed my enjoyment completely.			"

												I bought commandos Bundle on Sale . all 4 games work on Win 10 latest build , i checked Single player mode.The only complain i have is that the resolution is low , 720p 16:9 max .1080p would be ideal . also there is no steam overlay . i never played multiplayer and i wount be playing it now , so no idea about it . I have spent hundreds of hours of my childhood in commandos, its still equally fun , and there is no such strategy game  .10/10 recommend it to anyone .My device is Dell inspiron 7559 , core i7 , gtx960m (game doesnt use it and runs smoothly on integrated intel graphics)			"
