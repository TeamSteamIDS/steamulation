												Played this so many times on the PS2 I know all the locations of the enemies. This is really a great sniping simulator and WW2 shooter.+ Realisitic+ 4 difficulty settings including Custom+ Many missions that you can do different way+ 3 different snipers and a few other weapons+ Bullet cams+ Better graphics than PS29/10 - Played this way to much, recommend.

												A stealth title more than 3rd person war time shooter though when you pull out your sniper rifle you're in 1st person.  While sniping, you will have to take into account wind, gravity, your heartbeat as well as the air in your lungs, the latter of which you will be unable to exhaust with an elevated heart rate. The strategic element is important as the AI will investigate noises as well as fallen comrades and quickly gift you a bullet hole too many if you're not mobile enough.  The experience of pulling off difficult shots on moving targets is very satisfying.  The game employs a bullet cam and provides a stupendously graphic visualization of that soldier's jugular you just punctured complete with blood spurt. You're scored on your abilities as well and the game recognizes the type of shot in terms of distance, moving targets and parts of the body.  The save system is liberal enough so that you can save anytime, though the game will eventually inform you that you have saved too many times and thereby dock your score. Sniper Elite adds additional realism and tension by allowing you to comprehensively search the dead, many times under threat, for survival necessities as opposed to a brusque pat down which might just yield a couple of bullets, though the ability to move the cadaver to a safer area for inspection is available. While the visuals are indeed dated, the whole package creates an atmospheric stage consistent with bombed out Dresden and I would like to emphasize this accomplishment given the age of the engine. Once you have created a profile, 1080P is supported. Sniper Elite is the definition of a war time classic.			"

												Last of the truly good WWII games, Sniper Elite is more dedicated towards engaging your targets from a distance with a collection of different famous and accurately modeled sniper rifles from the era. You can adjust and customize your difficulty and all factors that affect the challenge of the game as you wish.It works without any problems on highest settings on Windows 7 64-bit. The graphics and voice acting are the weakest links in this otherwise fun game and it has great longevity as well as replay value. Unlike the later Sniper Elite games there's actual challenge here which feels exciting and authentic rather than purely scripted. There is barely any story to the game and the intro video is probably the as deep as you'll get to know anything about the setting of the game and its main character. The main point here is the gameplay which is tight and exciting. Of course, more so than its sequels, Sniper Elite is absolutely NOT purely an action game. You will die instantly if you run around trying to kill everybody. You need to act like a sniper and wait for the perfect shots and this is the main attraction for this game. The hunt for the perfect spot to snipe unsuspecting enemies from a mile away. There is at least 12 hours worth of single-player gameplay here plus multiplayer modes which I'm not personally familiar with.Remember the game can get highly challenging on higher difficulties and also READ THE GAME MANUAL BEFORE YOU START. There are quite some keys used in the game which you may need to write down in order to remember. No steam achievements.All in all, like good wine, this game has aged considerably well. If you look past the terrible voice acting and the old, repetitive graphics then you're in for a lengthy, exciting game full of sweat-inducing anticipation. Definitely worth picking up on a sale.

												OK so here's my review of this ""Old but Gold"" gamePros:-Looks solid for a 2005 game-Ammo and weapons from previous part of the mission gets carried over to the next part-Actually quite a scary atmosphere in this one unlike in the newer games-Realistic sniper simulation (including ballistic effects,wind and no tagging assist)-The game actually wants you to get used to scoping without any ""red markers""Cons:-Clumsiness-Raid on Nordsig :(So,that's about it I guess.BTW I played the game on PS2 before,but really wanted to get it on steam.If you bought it on anniversary sale for 1$ just like I did you're certainly gonna have a blast.

												Sniper Elite is a really tough oldschool game. If you don't like getting shot from 500 yards without even having seen your enemy, don't buy this. If you don't like crawling through the dirt for half an hour, craw around an edge and get shot to the face by a patrol you didn't know about, standing right behind that very edge, don't buy this.If you are into the thrill of potentially dying the very second you're exposed, this is for you. If you like lining up single shots from hundreds of yards away, this is for you. If you like physically viable bullet trajectories and realistic accuracy, this is for you.11/10 would get crushed by a tank again while trying to stealthily crawl around it.			"

												I won't lie. I pirated this game when it first came out because I was having serious financial issues. I enjoyed it then and when I saw it go on sale, I couldn't resist, even though GameSpy is now defunct. It's still as fun as I remember it. So for kicks I went ahead and bought SE2 since I had never played it and I love that one, too!Now to wait for a sale for SE3. And all because I once pirated this game...			"

												Very nice game for its time, this game is not ment for the run and gun type of people. This game requires a lot of stealth in order to get through most missions. Only some times you will have to shoot your way out of a situation. Overall, this is a very nice game, and I recommend this game.			"

												While for whatever reason the tutorial video may mislead you into thinking this is some sort of realistic war simulator such as Arma, this is a pretty standard action game for its time.Gameplay:The game has you going around the ruins of Berlin completing objectives, which can vary from getting from Point A to Point B, sabotage, and assassination mainly. Some missions require stealthing with your silenced pistol, some may recommend stealth, but can end up being exponentially easier if you decide to go guns ablaze. In general, the stealth element is more or less half-baked.As for difficulty, it is very forgiving. I played through the game once on Sniper Elite and hardly found any troubles. Actually, I lied. I really began the game on Marksman difficulty, yet by the next level the game automatically increased my difficulty to Sniper Elite due to my high score. This difficulty adjustment component is a cool, subtle feature that encourages players to take on a greater challenge when showing capability to do so; however, since the game is hardly challenging at all, it didn’t really matter.This lack of challenge comes from the previously mentioned ability to just blast through certain stealth sections, along with the surplus of ammunition that your current sniper rifle is constantly stocked with. It is also very easy to replenish health, as medkits are common and can instantly heal you to max health. Though there is a heart-rate feature that kicks in after strenuous activity on the protagonist (i.e. running for long periods), making it harder to aim when scoped, yet it can be sidestepped with some skill. You are simply too powerful. And because of this low difficulty, the game is quite a bit less memorable, but that doesn’t necessarily make it completely boring.The star of the show here is the well-known bullet-cam feature that was popular at the time in games and film. It is still quite satisfying to activate it when getting a long range head shot on an enemy sniper. One great thing is that it does not trigger too often, and still requires a decent shot to activate. This prevents the feature from growing stale, which if it did, I may have dropped the game altogether. One attempt to mediate a lack of replayability is a scoring system, as mentioned previously. At the end of each level, you are given a score based off of your kills, headshots, difficulty, etc. However, since there were no leaderboards or an additional medal/reward system, I had no idea how high of a score should be considered “good” or why I should care.The game is also marketed with supposed “Non-linear game play”, which is referencing the open-ish design of the maps, which are fairly large, considering its release date. Some missions may have alternative routes or methods of completion, though I found these to be a bit few and far between in my playthrough. This also means that you must constantly stop to check your map to make sure you won’t run into a dead end. I cannot say that the maps are worth a retread because of this element.There is also a multiplayer component, though I can’t comment on it due it being dead as a doornail. Graphics:For the time, the graphics are adequate. The models and textures are generally decent, and some of the skyboxes look rather nice. The animation quality when characters are talking is somewhat laughable, but the animation on the player character’s movement and enemies are passable. A problem I found is that I could hardly tell the difference between my allies and the enemies, as well as the enemy Germans and Russians. Luckily I never killed one of my allies because of this, though it was just annoying to have to wait a few moments to see if the soldiers would take a shot at me or not.One issue I have is that in some of the daytime city environments are drenched in this urine-colored hue, as you can probably see by the screenshots. Now I myself was never around to see war-torn Berlin to debunk their historical representation of it, however I can’t see much reason to depict it in this relatively unpleasant manner. Though not all maps have this yellow-ish filter place on them, some take place outside of the city and at different times of day, which somewhat helps the immersion factor. A few other aspects of the presentation I generally liked, particularly the war film-esque introductory video that really got me psyched to play the game. Yet while the tutorial video carried this aesthetic, it was arguably very misleading of how the game should be optimally played.A strange issue I ran into is that when you launch the game, for your previously selected graphics settings to take effect, you must load your profile first. I don’t really understand why graphics settings were decided to be tied to the save file, but it never really hindered the experience. Music:The game features a standard, forgettable orchestral soundtrack that fits the WWII-Cold War era quite well. When the missions are stealth focused, the music complements it with a quieter, tenser track. When you’re placed in the middle of the action, the music complements it was a fast-paced, booming tune. Standard stuff. I found that that only marginally stand-out track was the main theme. Story:The game also features a standard, forgettable war-hero storyline that centers on an American OSS Sniper, Karl Fairburne, in his mission to uncover nuclear secrets and eliminate German/Russian resistance during the post-WWII and pre-Cold War era. Nothing of the story really stood out to me, besides the mediocre voice acting, and the jarringly high-pitched voice of Karl, which was not particularly distracting, but just an odd choice of casting for the role. You would think a graduate of West Point Military Academy would have a deeper voice than a high school male who just hit puberty. Final Thoughts:While I purchased the game for only one dollar and got roughly nine hours of gameplay, I can safely say it was worth the money. However, whether the game is worth your time or not is subjective to you. I found the game to be overall pretty forgettable, besides those fun moments where the bullet-cam kicked in. This is a budget action game and it shows. I can see why Rebellion decided to develop a remake/sequel to this title, because there is potential in this game to become something greater. The problem is that the developer was just not as steady with their aim as they could’ve been. "

												A truly classic and personal game of mine. Oh? Why personal? Well...Go back to a time when the 360 was just out and the next gen of gaming consoles started. I never got a 360 untill about two years after it's release. So i was still playing my good ol' XBOX (my favourite console of all time).I had a few favourite games, but a few stood out. My mother's boyfriend at the time got a game when i had newly got my xbox around 2 years before that, and he played it alot and i watched and had a go every once in a while. That game was noen other than SNIPER ELITE. The game was fu**ing amazing to my little eyes. The bullet cam blew my mind, and when i got one it was like opening a Kinder Surprise and getting a new epic little piece of plastic to play with. I loved it.He lost interest in the game because he was a sports person so it was mine. I played the first two levels every once in a while because they were my favourites, the first i loved so much because something odd happened, a plane crashed right in front of me. No joke. My little mind went nuts, And i didn't want to quit the game because of such a sight. I thought: ""Where is the pilot?"" So i picked up a wounded enemy or ally (i can't remember now) and placed him next to the plane and did a little role playing. I had to quit eventually, and ever since i tried to re create that experience and only got the plane to spawn when i wasn't around to see it crash.Cut to years after that, i got my 360 and loved the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. I would still play my original XBOX, but the 360 was the console at that time for me. The sniper elite disc disappears, i can't remember how, but i was sad to see a game go. Early 2011 My 360 days were over, Microsft fu**ed me oever so i stopped playing my 360. I had nothing, but my laptop....I didn't have steam then, but i was recomemded to try it and my PC days went off (Fu*k consoles). My xbox was never collecting dust because i once again, still played it. But at this time i wanted to build my collection for it up again, so i started to buy  more and more games for it. around 2012 I went to my local video shop who were clearing all their now 'retro'      last-gen games, so my mum purchased as many original XBOX games as she could. One of them was Sniper Elite. I played the absolute sh*t out of it! And remembered the plane.....So by trying to trigger it be playing the level and restarting it over and over, only getting the plane to spawn when im not around, it finally happened. The plane crashed, infront of me. My heart stopped and my childhood memory was revived. True story. 10/10 Best Sniper Elite ever.  "

												I had the game in retail. I've never played it. I don't know what I did with that copy. And Sniper Elite V2 was free I think for one day. Well, since then, I've acquired DLC, Nazi Zombies trilogy and Sniper Elite 3. With the summer sale, I treated myself a favor: acquiring again Sniper Elite.And what a difference! I prefer largely V2 for cover thingy and for better use of commands. Because in Sniper Elite, you have to access the inventory THEN only you can use an item... and you have to exit the inventory if you want to shoot. The   radar isn't really as efficient as for V2 as you don't know if you're in the view of the enemy or not. Besides, here, you're dressed up like a German, yet, Germans shoot at you. Only the Resistance is on your side. And if I can add something else, the menu itself isn't so intuitive.Besides, sometimes, you're kinda lost at where you should go. The graphics are representative of back then... If I can tell that it was like that back then. Even Half-Life or Doom 3 had better graphics and they were released earlier than Sniper Elite. The soundtrack is the same as in V2 or Nazi Zombies.Sniper Elite isn't so hard itself. But when you have the V2, go for it. You don't need Sniper Elite at all as the storyline is more or less the same as in V2. Still, I can't tell NO to Do you recommend this game? Because yes, it's still a good game.			"

Sniper Elite			* 7/10I've decided to start the Sniper Elite Franchise as well, as it was on heavy sale. I've missed the WWII settings, it's been a while since I've played a game set in those times.Sniper Elite is a Third Person Shooter, with sniping sessions obviously in First person. You can approach your missions any way you like but the action-assault approach is very heavily penalized, if not almost prohibited sometimes. Stealth approach is often the most advisable, you can get behind enemies, distract them with diversive noises, hide in shadows or ruins, or even shooting while there are some bombings to prevent enemies soldiers from spotting you. Soldiers have a really good sight and an incredible hearing... Maybe excessive. Still more realistic than the classic metal gears view cones... XDYour arsenal includes your main weapon, the sniper rifle, a silenced gun and various rifles or machine guns. In your inventory you can count on some dynamite, time bombs, wire traps and a rock... A simple stone to create a diversion and distract enemies. XDYour missions vary from assaults, taking contacts, rescuing prisoners, ambushes and so on, and the settings are quite nice, ranging from bombed cities, trenched parks, factories and so on, and the single playr campaign is quite long, so it will keep you busy for a while.The soundtrack is not exactly outstanding but is a pleasant background, with some dynamic interactions when approaching an enemy or when approaching more enemies, or when you're being spotted.The game is quite old but the graphics is not that bad considering its release date. What I don't like are the characters movements, they're quite rigid and kind of... confused, I can't tell when he's crouched or standing, nor it doesn't crawl naturally as he keeps on turning when you move the mouse. Still it's a clever system, where you can increase or decrease its movement speed to also reduce the noise produced while moving.There is also a difficulty system which allows you to set your games in many details, beside the AI such as gravity (for long distance sniping), explosion radius and so on.Even considering the campaign and the story behind the missions, Sniper Elite isn't an outstanding title as there's no particular innovation, no involvement in the story nor any outstanding visual or musical parts. BUT it still is a nice title as, besides some very minor graphic glitches, there's nothing really wrong about it.+++PROs+++ SETTINGS. Some might say it's quite boring but I like the WWII games. The world is nicely built and visually satisfying. GAMEPLAY. This is not a common shooter as it focus mostly on sniping or stealth sections.---CONs--- POV. As a Third Person Shooter focused on sniping it might seem inappropriate as maybe a First person View would have fit better. MINOR BUGS. Nothing compromising the game of course, but there are some minor bugs as floating rocks, bad syncronized throwing system for the rock (inverted buttons and sometimes when you aim it simply goes on the wall next to you, or on the pole next to you, even though the aiming trajectory isn't showing anything), and the AI isn't particularly impressive, but you know, considering this was the first title of this franchise...

												Flawed, yet still an exciting, incredibly atmospheric experience. Marvellously captures the danger and crumbling decay of the ruins of Berlin, in April 1945 as the Third Reich was in its death throes. Although the graphics are old they are still evocative of the desperate cat-and-mouse struggle both German and Russian snipers engaged in. Frightening and distressing ambient sounds from the talented voice actors add to the tense, oppressive feel which is intrinsic to this whole game. The sniping itself is thoughtful and challenging although the reactions of enemy AI are both often ludicrously stupid and bizarrely intelligent at the same time. Your character's back story adds a further level of intrigue to this highly immersive shooter.A tense game with a very involving setting.			"

												Personally i did not like this game very much, the game mechanics can be very fun but after a while this game seems to just repeat itself with similar map layouts and objectives. If you did want to try this game then you would get around 5-7 hours gameplay but some people including myself may feel very let down on the storyline. This game does have a multiplayer mode but i have not tried it/checked to see if anyone is still playing.All in all i would not recomend this game if you are looking for an immersive game with a solid story, also if slighlty awkward dailogue puts you off then i would say that this game is a definate miss. One final thing to mention if you do decide that this game appeals to you is that during cutscenes there appears to be tearing at the very top of the screen and when changing missions you may drop out to your desktop very briefly. This shouldnt affect the game but it can be annoying at times.			"

												This game is really great for people that like snipers and thinking what to do.The game is old so don't expect beautifull graphics but the game is fun.For example, you spot an armored convoy with a tank, you need to decide how to go through it, should you shoot them one by one with a sniper, sneak past, or shoot the fuel cap on the tank taking them all down (which is hard sometimes).The controls are alright, the sounds are also great.The difficulty is really thought of, everything is well made, so it wouldn't be too easy nor too hard unless you want it to be.Oh yeah, when you shoot someone in the head, you can see the bullet going in slow-motion which is fun to whatch.All in all, i recommend it, get it.

												Sniper Elite is a tactical third-person shooter that hasn't aged very well, in both gameplay and graphics, since 2005. Being this the beginning of (what I heard is) a good video game series, this one is a overall pretty forgettable game. The sniper and stealth gameplay are well made, but it's just that. The story and characters are, like I said, forgettable. There's not much to say about it because there's not much to do in it either. It's basically killing nazis in slow motion while saving other soldiers.➡️️Final Rating: 6/10			"

												Sniper Elite taught me something about Sniper Games: that I don't like them.I thought I liked sniper-type gameplay. The sniper rifle is my best friend in Borderlands, or Deus Ex, or L4D or any other game that will give me the option.  But what I really like, it seems, is taking advantage of game AIs that don't contend well with a sniping approach.  I love taking out foes that have ""taken cover"" but left part of their heads sticking out.  I adore taking the time to line up the perfect headshot as an enemy runs directly towards me, across open ground, in a straight line.  I giggle when my shot from the rooftops drops an enemy in the middle of the street, which causes all buddies to rush out and cluster right in my sights.Sniper Elite, first of all, is a strong adherent to the reality-is-brown school of graphical design.  Which doesn't do any favours to the graphics, as they're already rather poor, even for 2005, relying too much on textures to save polygons.  So you trudge through a bland, unimmersive environment in order to accomplish your mission, only to find that the usual AI-abusing sniper tactics don't work here.  Unless you've played a level already and memorized the locations of the enemy NPCs, you have to sneak (slowly) everywhere, because NPC snipers are ready to do to you what you'd normally do to them if you go running around in the streets.  So you have to be patient.  Very, very patient.  Which is boring.  When the game does get exciting, it likes to do so by throwing a tank at you, or spawning a couple of guys at short range, so that you don't get to play with the sniper rifle anyway.Between all the sneaking, and crawling, and waiting, and waiting some more, and crawling a bit, and waiting again, I've never had a less fun time with a simulated sniper rifle in my hands.  On the plus side, the game did manage to capture the feeling of being a very vulnerable, mortal soldier, alone in a dangerous environment.  I just prefer the feeling of being a cunning, dangerous predator, methodically eliminating hapless prey, and Sniper Elite was not going to give me that.			"

												The graphics may be bit dated but for me, gameplay is king. This game is thoroughly enjoyable and in my opinion still the best sniper game up to now.  I had this game years ago and decided to pick it up again and I haven't regretted that decision. It's definitely not for people who like blasting through enemies and stomping all over the map. This one gets you into a zen like state while shooting enemies from a distance.Sure you can just grab a machine gun and start mowing down enemies and firing bazookas at tanks. But the reward of a head shot from afar or stealthily planting TNT behind tanks and blowing them up from a safe place can't be compared to that.If you want an action game that is relaxing and peaceful, try this game out.

I've tried on numerous ocassions to find out what sound I need to mask it with but I've found literally nothing. To hide it.REGARDLESS FROM THAT POINT, stellar game.

												This game captured the raw essence of being a sniper in Germany during WW2 and I'll tell you how! First, you crawl to a building, crawl up stairs, crawl yourself to the window and kill people. Once you're done killing people, you need to crawl towards your exfiltration zone occasionally killing more people. This process repeats for each mission and there are 8 missions so get crawling kiddos. 6/10			"

Pros + Good game for 2005+ Favors a stealthy approach, but its not impossible without it+ Pays to plan out how you take each mission+ Patience is a virtue+ Sniper rifle kill cam is always entertainingCons- Clunky controls- Game hasn't been updated with controller support the way a number of other older titles have- The game feels unimportant to the series despite being the one started it			"

												Jawol mein Fuhrer. We will destroy the new wave of traitorous Germans and the Russian invaders. Erwin Konig has been interested in this game - says the Ballistics are a bit off, the Russian snieprs are as stupid and mostly a propaganda tool for the Russians - he knows best of course as he was never killed by Zaitsev. After meeting with Koenig at the secret sniper training school near to the West of where i was holding the Americans off, Steiner informed me of the task to hold Berlin. I had the pleasure of meeting Konig and seeing him in action, what a spectacle. Picking off noob Russian Troops, hitting tanks in the fuel cap to blow them up, my my, our man has talent. Anyway, he informed me of the game, yes the slow mo close up shots are like looking through the scope of our ultra brilliant G43 and K98 Sniper rifles, you get a close up of the pain the fellow you just shot is going through, the judging for wind is good. After experiencing the winds on the Volga river he knows all to well of the harsh Russian winds. He says to me, Wenck! you must buy this game, everyone must by this game! You to could snipe like the great Erwin Konig! Kill the Russians! Snipe the traitors! Enroll today and become a small unit of my twelth army to deploy in the bombed out ruins of Berlin and other untermench cities!!  "

												The cold grey rain sliced through me as I lay amid the shattered remains of the once proud building.  The sounds of artillery in the distance broke the silence, and the occasional rat scurried among the debris strewn along the broken street below.  I waited, rifle poised, scope zeroed on the spot where the General would step from his car.  Patience, my friend, patience.  The armed sentries patrolled within feet of my position, talking amongst themselves, oblivious to my presence, and I lay silent watching them pass, close enough to smell the vodka on their breaths and see the sweat stains on their uniforms.Senses heightened I watched the car approach, the small flags fluttering on the rounded front wings,  as if my target needed any further attention in this blackened city.  I waited and watched as the car drew to a halt and watched the driver open the rear door.As the General stepped out I took aim, holding my breath, and gently squeezed the trigger.Buy this game.			"

												Sniper Elite, the first game of the Sniper Elite series.This 3rd person shooter takes you back to Berlin 1945 where you follow Karl Fairburne. Not much is known about him, only that he grew up in Berlin and that he studied at the US Militairy Academy in West Point. In the game he says the US army chose him because of his wide knowledge in the German language and Berlin itself. In Berlin you'll come across several rival factions including the German resistance, the Soviet NKVD and the Nazi's. Also included in the game are several historical world war 2 figures, like Nazi official Martin Bormann and General Patton. This game shows that the Cold War that followed shortly after was already going on inside the ruins of Berlin.			"

												Extremely fun. Despite it shows its age, the recreation of some characteristic german buildings and the realistic difficulty makes it a beautiful and challenging game. On highest difficulty you'll need around 12h to finish it. Unfortunatelly it uses the defunct Gamespy to store high scores (which doesn't affect the playability and you can disable in the menu when creating a profile) so that functionality will be missing. The game runs very smooth on modern PCs at highest quality video settings.			"

												Sniper Elite makes headshots a grizzly reward that becomes addictive and, because the battle is always weighted against you, filled with air-punching satisfaction every time you make a connection. The realism may turn off some run and gun gamers, but even those fans will have a hard time not appreciating what Sniper Elite brings to the table in terms of great and entertaining game play.Only the best of the best will see the final missions in Sniper Elite mode, but for the rest of us, Rebellion has created a remarkable, beautifully brutal WWII game that’s smarter than the usual fodder lining game store shelves.

												Great sniping game that strives for accuracy (ha!).  Though they're on difficulty settings, bullets are affected by windage, posture, & gravity.  Running and gunning CAN work on low difficulty settings, but crawling & selecting sniping spots = most fun.  Furthermore, noise plays a role - when emplaced enemies are within earshot but not line-of-sight, masking one's rifle shot with the sound of mortar fire (very common: it's May 1945 in Berlin) is wise and does work.The kill cam is pretty fun but gruesome: most headshots will trigger a slo-mo, bullet-follow cam that'll show your shot.  The game also tracks relevant stats (farthest shot, stealthy shots, head shots, etc).Missions, when played stealthily, are long: I sunk 2 hours into the first one.Awesome game.  It requires the right mindset, but it's not overly hard if you really get into it.			"

												It just feels too dated to play through it properly expecially after the release of the sequel. I might have played more of the game if my character didn't get stuck during a mission after quick loading the game, he just wouldn't move. The thought of replaying that mission from the start again was enough for me to call it quits. The game is still very playable today but all the games mechanics i feel are improved in the sequels and the whole time i was playing this game i was just saying to myself 'id rather be playing the sequels instead'. It's not like there is an interesting story or characters that's pulling me through the game. It's kind of why i feel the sequel was called V2 (aside from the V2 rockets of course), because it is a better version of the gameplay from this game.			"

But, you cannot take the ammo from a ppsh-41 for the mp40, you can only change the weps.-Gewehr 42 uses the same ammo as the Moist Nugget, but I am pretty sure it does not in real life.-Homicidal ducksThere are sometimes ducks/some kind of birds on the maps.

												An average World War II shooter typical of his generation: tight graphics, good ambientation and mechanics in theory but really bad implemented. The designers failed because were overpassed by the rigour of the History. Simply, they were unable to implement the realistic mechanics and the correct ambientation that requires; they not had the expensive devices and recourses that were needed to make it possible. Sure with a science fiction shooter, but not with historical one. Is the common error of its generation, and reason by almost all shooters of WWII were more or less middling videogames.For example, this game has stealth system, but is poor: no knifes, and use weaponry attracts all enemies nearby to player to his exactly location, the sniper rifle is worst option than a silenced pistol or submachine guns. Appear to be a playground, not the scenary of a huge and horrible war. The buildings are planes like a painted cardboard, without alive civilians or their corpses, rare in a very populated city even in the times of this famous battle. Only few places are open to move into: all closed doors and windows are intact and unbreakable, soldiers can not shoot to the locks or kick down the doors. This city would be a true 3D laberinth, not a plane grating. There are invisible walls or insurmountable obstacles: player can crouch, but not jump. Enemies can appear from nowhere only when player arrives to certain places, and soon or later has impression that only goes from one ambush to another. In his days maybe was a wonderfull game because the other options were more or less the same. Only recommended to nostalgicals of this period of videogames. Obviusly, is cheap.			"

												Here is the biggest problem with the game. None of the mechanics that the game advertises actually work!The game bills itself as a stealth game where you sneak around from cover to cover, completing your objectives, while occasionally taking a stealth shot at an enemy. In reality, your camoflage system is worthless.  In the first mission you are decked out in a German forest commando pattern. Unfortunately the mission takes place in a generic war-torn eastern european city. Essentially you are a giant green tree in a sea of brown. Good luck getting your ""hidden"" over 50%.The game tutorial gos on and on about using your binoculars to scout for enemies before moving out of cover and advancing. Seems good in theory, but in practive all the enemies stay hidden around corners until they are scripted to pop out of their hiding places once you get within spitting distance. And when they do so they come out guns blazing like a wall-hacker in an FPS! What is the point of playing a sniper who has to scout out the enemy and take them out from a distance when the game mechanics actively make that impossible?The game  even acknowledges that it failed at it's objective when during the later part of the first mission it litteraly tells you to pick up a sub-machine gun and start blasting waves of enemies about to come at you. Yep, that's exactly what I want out of my SNIPING GAME!The only good thing I can say is the actual sniping mechanics of wind and gravity affecting the shot work pretty well! Now if only you were given a chance to properly use them. If you want a stealth game with a decent sniping mecahnic you would be bettter off playing and of the first 4 Hitman games or even their middle-market counterparts Death to Spies.			"

Graphics are outdated, but the game has cool features - create custom difficulty(many sniping options: wind, gravity, hearth rate), bullet cams, inventory, smart AI, grab bodies and searching them for items - ammos, granades and etc, multiple speed levels for walking/running...

												Probably revolutionary for 2005, but 10 years later, it's quite cumbersome. Having been introduced to the series with the two Zombie editions, V2, and then 3, I unfortunately find the original that started it all to be way too tedious let alone hard on the eyes.

												Reviews on this have been mostly bad. I tend to jump on a few games just cuz I like the premise. I bought this cuz it was like a buck. I tried to play the game, I really did. but when you have great games like COD and MOH its hard to wade through this difficult and demanding game. Im not opposed to stealth its just this game makes it difficult to do so. and checkpoint saves would have helped, (although you get 5 saves you can save anywhere anytime). you spend 30 min crawling through rubble and complete 2 obj and dodge a few tanks just to get shot in the back and have to start over. I Cant tell you how many grenades I took. Understanding the core of the game is the key to success. I put over 20 hours, mostly in replays caused by death, and have come out with a new appreciation for this game. Its actually alright. considering its 2005 youd kind of hope for more visually, but its alright. 6.5/10			"

												RO: Unul dintre acele jocuri clasice care merita jucate, daca iti place sa fi joci ca sniper, ei bine atunci o sa adori acest joc. Fiind printre putinele jocuri sniping pe care le cunosc, pot spune ca este unul foarte reusit (are si o continuare mai noua, Sniper Elite V2, care continua oarecum povestea). Are si niste puncte slabe, ♥♥♥ ar fi dificultatea nu prea ""ridicata"" (parca cea mai grea dificultate, Sniper Elite, este oarecum usoara). Per total este un joc foarte bun pentru anul lui care merita sa-l incerci. Ah da, am uitat sa mentionez, partea de Multiplayer este destul de activa (~400 jucatori) !EDIT: Din pacate, multiplayer-ul a fost inchis, dupa multi ani de activitate, pacat, dar tot ramane un clasic.EN: One of those classic games that you must try, if you like to play like a sniper, well you'll enjoy this game. It's one of the few sniping games that I know but I can say that this one is really good (it also has a newer sequel, Sniper Elite V2). But it also has some negative things, like the game difficulty (the hardest difficulty is not that hard). Overall it's a really nice game.EDIT: Unfortunately, the multiplayer has been closed, after many years, it's a shame, but the game is still good.			"

												Awesome game. You are playing as a single soldier (American) who is often trying to flank or snipe down the enemies using his favourite sniper rifle but in many cases uses different gunpower to eliminate the objects. This is just another of those good games you will progress hardly through enemy lines.One thing that annoys me a lot are the hints that pop up all the time throughout first mission.So far I got to second great mission. One mission consists of parts, so if you use all your medkits, bombs or ammo for machine gun, be sure next level you have spent them and you need to look for another resources from that soldiers, but at the beginning of each session you get some ammo.

												I try out the game, not bad for the age. Not very good for reacording cut scenes and such but maybe it could handle a different recording software. It's a pretty good game consider how old it is. I suppose it could be more of a simulation with the difficulty put up high. The gameplay and setting is great, the World War 2 atmosphere is nicely detailed.Here's a gameplay on the first time I try the game:

												Sniper elite is one of my favorite ww 2 series especialy for a very old game it was well designed and a game ahead of its time.The story starts in 1945 you are an american oss operative sent to Germany,Berlin to recover and kill german rocket scientist before the russian nkvd takes them away into Russia.Now the gameplay is very fun but also sometimes very hard bicause you must never go activate your Jhon Rambo mode you have to use stealth but if the enemy finds you it would be a good time to relocate and use your enviorment to hide yourself.The Russian and German soldiars are very powerfull enemies and can take you outh very quickly especialy with those grenades and i personaly had a lot of problems with them.The games eviorments are quite fun very well done and i loved them.But the most important thing in sniper elite is the bullet time.Bullet time shows your bullet flying in slow motion and shows you where you hited the enemy and it has been also well done in sniper elite v 2.My final verdict for this game is an 9,9/10 bicause of the fun story and the gameplay but the gameplay would be perfect if karel freiburg would stop acting like he is walking on the middle of the ice rink seriously.

												Sniper Elite doesn't handle new Graphics Cards well so the frame rate is extremely low if you put the game on maximum quality. This is really sad though because if I can I like my games to run on the maximum settings possible. However, the gameplay is extremely realistic and makes me actually feel like a Sniper. It's going to take some time for me to get used to the controls in this game but I feel once I get playing it enough I'll get hooked. I bought the trilogy since it was on sale for 15.99, I couldn't pass up that deal considering it was selling for 79.99 off sale. I still have yet to try 2 and 3. I highly recommend this game but just know that if you are using a computer with a newer graphics card you have to put the settings on low-medium if you want to be able to play the game without hiccups otherwise it's just like watching a slideshow on maximum settings.

												I wish I there was a Neutral or Inbetween recommendation. I'm iffy on this title.I love the bullet ballistics and what not, it feels nice to see my bullet enter a Soviet or German sniper's eye from 200 meters.The sniping is great, it feels fluid and easy to pick up on.Where this game fails greatly, is in stealth and standard infantry combat.The enemy has eagle eyes, they can catch a mere glimpse of you and raise the alarms. A small noise? Causes over 8 enemies to ready their guns and get ready to kill. Heres a good question, how come PPSHs, MP-40s, and MG-42s can hit me more accurately than I can snipe at 200 meters? Just curious, cause I've died over 12 times in one mission due to MG-42 wielding Soviets and Germans. Another good question; how come the enemy can carry a huge MG-42 HEAVY Machine Gun like its a toy; and shoot you accurately?I love this game to death, but as you progress in the game the enemies just get harder and harder making the game UNFAIR. Which devalues it in my eyes. Don't get me wrong; I love a challenge, but theres a difference between a challenge and unfair... and this game is VERY unfair.			"

												 Where do I begin? This is a game that will have your heart pounding, your forehead sweating, and beyond paranoid. At least that's how I started out.  You will certainly feel like a sniper surrounded by enemies, laying hidden in the rubble and filth of war. A tank rumbling along 50ft to your left, and four soldiers to your right, you have the power to live or die, you just have to play it right. Sniper Elite is a diamond hidden in the mud. Don't be fooled by nay sayers and good graphics fan boys, this is a gem you will definately want to have in your steam library. Loads of replayability, and very satistying gameplay. Enjoy.			"

This is honestly a pretty solid game for when it was created, and it's fun.  The graphics are pretty good considering the timeframe, though the settings and art lack inspiration.  Certainly more could have been done to express the gloomy destruction of end-of-war Berlin, but as it is, it's ok.  And, there are a couple of missions where the art is pretty darn good, especially the last one, but this seems to stand in contrast to the more generic levels.  The sound is, well, alright.  The background run on a repeating track of explosions that pauses slightly when it ends and begins.  Even for the timeframe, this is a little below par, but you'll tune it out eventually.  The mechanics are actually a lot of fun, and you'll get the hang out controlling your character pretty quick.  He tends to slide all over the place while running, but you won't be doing much running.  There's actually a lot of game here too.  I kind of thought I'd be through the story a lot quicker than it did. It was a good run, and while this game doesn't exactly translate as a work of art, I'd recommend it just for the joy of headshotting about 2000 Soviets.			"

												One of the best WW II Games i ever played, if you want a different story from world war II games then this is the game for you, in this game it says you are an american sniper dressed as german sniper but in fact i think this is a lie because developers are not allowed to make a game where you play as a nazi so they just came up with this lie. In this game you see a different view of world war II, the ending days of berlin and how german troops are leaving berlin and russisns invading germany, full of emotional moments at the endings. for its time it had the best graphics and gameplay. the bullet mechanics are amazing the bullet cam is also amazing. The multiplayer died because of server shut down and i remember even though when Sniper elite v2  was out this game had more players in multiplayer than V2. the reason is pretty simple because sniper elite 1 was original it had health bar and was hardcore and classic game in both single player and multiplayer. I really really recommend this game and i think anyone who loves world war II games should try this out.			"

												Well this is a pretty good game if you like sniping. Take place in WWII Germany and well, you are basically a sniper that has different missions to take on. You also have a machine gun a pistol you can use in certain situations, but the overall game play is pretty good. The highlight of this game is the ""bullet view"". If you land a nice headshot or a good shot, you will see a bullet cam in slow motion from your rilfe and pellet into your enemy. A nice touch.The graphics are of something that reminded me of Counter-Strike 1.6. But that should not affect your game play.HOWEVER, the only downside is the controls. When you are running, you cannot stop on a dime so when you let go of your button, your character will drift for a second. This is and should add realism, but the fact when you are running away, corners and obstacle are a nuicance and you get stuck for that second on that object until your drift stops. That one second that can make or break the mission. All in all, it's also a short to medium game. I bought it with the package on Winter Sale 2015  and this one was about $3. Best $3 I spent and this game should not disappoint.If you buy this game to go Rambo style, well it kind of defeats the purpose. There are instances where you can, and where you have no choice, but it's really to see what it's like to be a sniper.			"

												Sniper Elite, the original sniping game, was a console game port set in WW2, and it is an interesting ""sandbox"" type game where you are given an objective and how you approach the mission is up to you. You work for the OSS, predecessor of the CIA, and your job to prevent the high-tech German scientists were working on from falling into Soviet hands. This means you will be fighting both Germans and Russians, usually behind enemy lines. You will crawl, sneak, walk, and run around the level, set traps to cover your back, make a silent kill or two, use sound of artillery to cover your shots, and so on. The levels are quite open, and enemies have patrol routes but will react to you and other factors. Actual approach is up to you. Ambush with bombs, shoot with gun, or other approaches? The interface is clunky due to console port laziness, but the ""bullet cam"" where the viewpoint tracks the bullet and the kill lead to a lot of imitations since. All in all, this is a game that started the genre, and it can be extremely hard, but extremely rewarding. If you find this too hard, try its sucessor, Snipe Elite V2, a thoroughly modernized remake.			"

												Personal rating: 4/10, worth playing, but only if you're patient enough.Pros:-nice ballistic system: gravity, wind, your own heartbeat will affect your accuracy.-impressive headshots, kinda reminds me about Fallout 3/NV, except it's not as messy.-you can take a minigun and rush forward, but that's an easiest way to die. The game forces you to play as sniper, what a surprise.-missions are pretty interesting. Most of the times you have to infiltrate the heavily guarded territory (alarm = game over), take a position (optional: plant explosives everywhere), then start shooting like crazy in everyone.Cons:-cities are pretty much empty. Most of the building are permanently locked, so you cannot enter them and you can't get on the roof for a good sniping position. Although some enemies are able to do that. And those roofs that you can enter are pretty useless, because AI instantly notices you there from afar.-and the worst part of this game:AI is pretty much broken. You can snipe an enemy out of bushes with one single bullet from a great distance and enemies will instantly know where it came from. It feels like I appear on their minimap like a big glowing dot right after the shot from any weapon without silencer (i.e. anything other than silenced pistol, which has awful accuracy on medium to long ranges).So after any shot all enemies on the map will be rushing towards you, no matter how well you hid or if you ran away right after the shot.What was the point of creating a game where you have to play sniper, but you also can't do that, I don't know.If not that, I'd easily rate this game 7/10, which is pretty good by my standards.If you played first CoD and ever thought something like ""But I don't want be here, I want to be on that hill with a sniper rifle"", this game is definitely for you. If you liked Rogue trooper, you'll probably like this game as well.It felt like a good game indeed, but I guess I'm not patient enough.The last straw was the mission in a field with 2 enemy snipers, me and big ♥♥♥ gun that fired every 10 seconds or so.I thought it was put there by devs to provide sound masking option for stealthy sniping enemy snipers.So I counted seconds, then put a perfect headshot from ~200 metres in enemy sniper.I could have sworn this was a sound masked shot - I fired the same time with that cannon.But, apparently, second sniper somehow heard it and instantly saw me and started to shoot at me (I was ~300 metres away from him, crawling in bushes). So... ragequit. Very disappointing.			"

The game that started the ""Kill-Cam"".
This game is actually really hard, like the original Call of Duty, you don't regenerate health, you need to find health packs, which are RARE to find. While other snipers you don't notice hit you and kill you, so you have to memorize where all the enemies are before advancing, making the game very enjoyable if you have the patience.
It's extremely challenging but fun nonetheless.

												Sniper Elite's tutorial level introduces a variety of intriguing mechanics.  The ability to set traps, fire and relocate, scout ahead and plan your assault, etc... none of which actually end up being viable in the game.  It thinks its a tactical simulator, and it has a punishing health system and limited saves to encourage you to be careful and stealthy.  But omniscent enemy AI, linear levels, and a penchant for sending waves and waves of NPCs at you make intelligent tactical play all but impossible.  What's more, the clunky controls make simply moving around a chore.Both Sniper Elite 2 and Sniper Elite 3 (which is the first game in the series to actually make good on the promises of the original) are better than this one in every way.  Just purchase one of them instead.			"

												In short, Sniper Elite is a third-person-view PS2-era shooter about American covert operative in Berlin in May of 1945, sniping Soviets and occasional Germans with that famous ""bullet cam"" effect, ""borrowed"" from Max Payne games. I can recommend it only to people who want to kill Ruskies in bulk. There you'll be mowing hundreds of those stupids. Which is good, if you're, say, some right-winged Nazie-lover, still wishing for re-count with USSR. I repeat - for the most of the game, you'll be running in Wehrmacht uniform, assisting Germans in killing Soviets and hiding some ""war secrets"". Great deeds for every karma, don't ya think?As of shooter rules, obviously, this game is focused on using the sniper rifles. Using those boomsticks was somewhat elaborative for the year 2005, as those rifles are using basic ballistic rules, so the rifle bullets are flying on some parabolic arc and not just direct line. Which means that you need to aim higher on bigger distances. You can use some other weapons, like a silenced pistol, or guns picked from your enemies (machine guns like DP-27 or PPSh), but their ballistics were nerfed alot, to make player use his main rifle more than other weapons. Alas, the situations where you're supposed to perform really long shots is quite numbered. Damn, there are only 5 maps for the whole game! And only 2 of them are of some use for sniper work.As of ""stealth"" there... Just forget the word. You can't be stealthy. Your silenced pistol can't work, your enemies will always be knowing where you are, no matter how good you're with hiding in dark pixels.Now, WW2 tag. It's fake. The history details were not simple altered. The whole game setting is a pure phantasy! Where diesel tanks can be blown up with normal bullets, where war veterans waltz in the war zone without cover, and don't hide in front of enemy. Where... everything is not simple not based on reality, but twisted with good amount of absurd and ignorance.What I have against that game other than siding with Nazies in their fight against good guys? As I am sure that Russkies in the 1945 were certainly good guys killing the dragon with the sword, whereas USA was dropping A-bombs and performing all other usual stuff like turning into dust by carpet bombing cities like Tokio, Dresden, Würzburg, Swinemünde and so on... And yes, the story of covert support of Nazies retreat and revival is one which (some people in) USA is quietly proud of, and I strongly despise.Read some books about it before critizing me there, folks.Okay, again - why Sniper is a bad game, in my opinion?First is the setting, where you have 5 maps on 28 ""missions"", with huge backtracking part, always. The structure of levels leave to player a light possibility to make some maneuvers, but in practice it is even more strained, than in the Crysis 2. If you count the possibility to turn left or right from rails as ""non linear game play"", I'm sorry for you. In the end, Sniper Elite turns out just as beeline as any typical shooter, very far from the defintion of ""non linear""-something.Second, the AI. It is horrendous. The meanest soldiers of the Europe of year 1945 never use any real combat tactics. They just standing in the middle of a street, shooting at you, or rushing forward on your position. On the other hand, they will be always knowing where would you go, no matter how silent you are, how many hours you spend crouching and proning in the shadows. Dead stealth experience.Third, the weapons aren't any good, even with addition of ballstic rules. I know dozens of other games, where you can hone your sniper skills much better.All in all, there is no point for I can like this game. But I'll give it a 5/10 mark, for its effort to improve the ""bullet cam"" effect. Now, I know there are a big fan base of Sniper games, which turn down any negative review on their beloved ""shoot-the-Soviet"" shooter. I can't care less.			"

												Sniper Elite is a stealth-sniping based WW2 shooter released by Rebellion in 2005 year and was also released on PS2 and then Wii. Compared to console ports, the only thing you are missing out is a 2-player coop mode. Have to get consoles if you want that.EDIT: Turns out that Wii version has exclusive Flak Tower mission. Huh. Interesting.And talking of multiplayer, it was Deathmatch. But GameSpy was shut down, so choosing online option simply freezes game up. You can only play by LAN, if you have a friend who can come to your room and share some Sniping love. Otherwise, count that Multiplayer isn't available anymore and you only have Single-Player campaign.Upon launching the game you will be greeted by an intro that explains the main plot of a game: You are American sniper who has to disguise as German soldier and start to shoot down Red Army and Nazis alike while getting rare help from German Resistance. All so Red Army will not get hands on Nuclear research in Berlin. Doesn't exactly makes you feel like a hero. Nothing much to say for plot, it kinda moves on during game.Now, before moving to gameplay, I should say few things about setting. A falling Berlin. End of war. The music, while usually silent, will give you a taste of heavy atmosphere during each small introduction (camera shows you the surroundment) and action. Most of your time will be spent in a dirty ruins of a city, crawling under rain, being away from front lines and constantly hearing artilery fire. But on another side, it's an ugly WW2 game. Technically it was outdated by the time and artistically, well, it's as brown as WW2 shooters get.At least you can see realistical rainbow in one of the levels. So that's at least something.Before you start the game, you get to choose difficulty setting. I would divide it into three categories: AI, instant switch and sniping simulation settings. I highly recommend to turn all sniping simulating setting on, it's a sniper game. Well, at least it gives better gameplay on very very few maps where your objective is long-distance sniping at incoming waves of Russians. AI in this game is random, both stupid and brutal. Turn this on normal or such. As for instant switching: With instant switching it will make a more action game where you can hold machine gun all time and quickscope heads as soon as you want. But with it switched off you will never use Binoculaurs, with which you can look futher than with Sniper Rifle scope, as it will leave you with no defense. And then you are off to the first level of the game. And they say that the first level gives a much important first impression. And well, as for as gameplay goes, it may be so.Checking the map you figure out that the best way to approach main objective is a way around. As flanking is more clever. And optional objective is there anyway. Next thing you are slowly crawling over the ground, looking around with binoculars, being inspired to do so from tutorial video. You crawl carefully over the canal only to get killed from behind, as the camera points at the random soldier behind you, who came out from his cozy sewer, somehow becoming aware of your existance despite you not making so much sound.AI in this game is quite random. In some cases he will notice you seemingly by itself, as if scripted, in some cases it can't be avoided. In other cases he can be stupid. He may be clever, but it really doesn't feel fair often. Even worse is that once you are noticed by a single soldier, it feels like everybody in the level will become aware of your current and future positions.That, and I don't think you can hear their footsteps clearly.Movement and pace is different from what you expect. Most likely, you don't really need to crawl. Standing doesn't have much use either, running and walking while crouching is the best there. You can change speed with mouse wheel like in Sprintel Cell, so that's one cool point.After restarting the mission, you decide to try a head-on approach to the location and walk toward the direction until you notice a soldier on another side of level. You hide behind cover and scope in into your sniper. Taking gravity, wind into mind, as well waiting for artilery fire to hide your shot sound (hopefully you read manual) you shoot. BAM! An infamouse Bullet Cam kicks in, following the bullet, as you watch it blow poor soldier's cheek off. Awesome! Game announces it as Covert Kill.And then, despite being sneaky and scoring Covert KIll, few more of his friends come out from distance and start to attempt to shoot you down, maneuvering between covers. Throwing away sneakyness, as you can't lose them off your tail, you just shoot them down with your Sniper Rifle.Game really feels like it's easier and more fun to beat as your everyday WW2 shooter with a bit of stealth here and there. At least it's more reliable than hoping that AI will be fair to you.Aside from Sniper Rifle you also get Silenced Pistol which can instakill enemies if you are close enough and was't noticed, sneakily, more reliable than Covert Kill. You also can pick up grenades. And you can pick up either sub-machine gun or machine gun. Sub-machine is common and good for close range. Machine gun isn't as common, but there will be enough for it for both you and enemies, and it works at all ranges. Yes, enemies with it will kill you even from sniper range. Brings some frstating moments.Then you are sent to rescue injured person. You kill a guard there and then enter a room. After that, you get to grab supplies, tripwire mines and be noted that more soldiers are coming to check out what happened. First time you try to set up tripwires mines, you get killed before you are finished. Second time you succeed, only to have injured soldier killed by mine explosion nearby.You get to have some items: Healing ones, TNT (Protip: You can throw them like grenades too), rock that I never used and a tripwire mines. Actually, first level doesn't show tripwire mines any justice, they are quite useful there.Another huge problem of a game got to be scripted events that go against the sniper premise. Even if you want to focus on sniping alone, be ready that game will often send soldiers at you, maybe even around the very corner. It's not full stealth, for sure.You even get some levels where you have to kill everyone.And so, outside of few levels where you get to snipe from excellent sniping high position and very very few levels where stealth is forced, it playes like everyday dull WW2 shooter with sniper rifle and feels like a chore to complete. Good idea, bad execution, like some said before. Unless that's what you want, you should skip this one.			"

												Bought this game as part of a pack sale with Sniper elite 2 and 3 as well. Cost $15 total, where Sniper Elite 3 on it's own cost me $10, so an extra $5 for 1 and 2? sure, why not. Even if I only play 10 hours total for Sniper Elite 1 and 2, that's a great deal for the price paid versus time spent. As a disclaimer, I haven't actually spent 7 hours on this game, I went to watch TV and fell asleep for a few hours with the game still running.I can't recommend this game. Not even slightly. I would have never bought this game without it's bigger brother, Sniper Elite 3, being on sale and part of a pack. This game advertises itself as sneaking around and a stealth type game, where none of that matters.I played this game in 2015, where the game was released in 2005. I may be unfairly critizing the game, but trying to put myself in my 2005 shoes, I couldn't imagine myself liking this game. All the things that the trailer and tutorials for this game pride itself on, make no sense in the actual game. I made it as far as the 3rd mission in this game before completely giving up on it. The 3rd mission plays a bit differently than the first two missions do, in that you are not supposed to be detected for the first half of the mission. This is why I gave up on the game on this mission, because it just doesn't seem to work...like, at all.I start out the mission, you have to wait for guards sporadically turning back and forth, which I guess is the technology of the time's version of a guard trying to watch his patrol area. I use a silenced pistol to take out the first guard and drag away his body. That's why this is funny, because I'm completely in range of the other guards outside of the walls when I'm standing up with their buddy. Fine, that must be that stealth mechanic I heard about in this game. I sprint up to a hole in the wall, about 20m from another guard before going prone to crawl through it. Not spotted yet, maybe the stealth in this game was hindered by the technology available, and I can do more than I'm supposed to be able to do. I crawl through the wall, and a scripted sequence occurs where the Russians attack the base, and you're 'masked' by the Russian advance. Now, at this point, why is it that the Germans are staring at me no matter what I do...I redid this mission about 6-8 times to be sure, and each time plays out exactly the same.There is no stealth mechanic...at least not one that makes any kind of decent sense. What makes it worse, not only are the Germans watching me in the midst of a Russian attack (I have screenshots of them running towards me while a T-34 is behind them lighting them up with the coax and a sniper on a roof getting shot up while staring at me), but the roof's where the snipers are don't have display models that line up...meaning it looks like i can shoot a sniper because it looks clear, but my round hits an invisible surface each time. Even worse than that, one of the roof top guards has a MG-42, and can snapshot me, while I can't hit him through the invisible surface.In summary, this game was only $0.99 by itself (if I remember correctly), but I don't think it would be worth it on it's own. Generally, the rule of thumb I use is, if I can pay $5, and play for longer than 2 hours per $5 spent, then it would be worth it. This game, I gave the benefit of the doubt and played probably 3 or so hours (not the 7 my account says...as previously stated), but I found myself annoyed through most of it. Playing a game for a few hours and being annoyed all the way through is a metric that just doesn't make it into a raw, hours played versus dollars paid.Time to give up on this 10 year old game, and move on to Sniper Elite 2.

												Moving around in this game, is like sliding around on ice.  This is the worst character movement control I have ever experienced.  COMPLETELY ruins this game for me.You press to move forward... your character slllllloooooooowwwwwwly starts to move...You go to turn, he turns sideways, but continues to move in the direcdtion he was running... now running sideways.You let go the W key to stop... he keeps running... takes about 50 feet to stop.This alone ruined this game for me.Already uninstalled it,...Moving on the ES 2. (bought the trilogy for 16 bux...)   so I don't feel I wasted too much money on the first one, just wasted 2 hours is all.Oh, and you don't do a lot of sniping in this game.  Mostly just ""shooting"" at mobs that are charging at you.			"

												Actual Recommendation: Neutral (read below for details) I liked the presentation of this game when I first started it: a WW2 game all about sniping and stealth! I appreciate games that embrace a more niche appeal as opposed to mass appeal where everybody wins easily because the mechanics are streamlined to the point that the gameplay lacks depth. Such mass appeal games tend to lack personality in my opinion: you could substitute one for any of a dozen others and be forgiven for forgetting which one you were playing. Sniper Elite has personality and some depth to its mechanics, but the execution of the whole package didn't satisfy me. The most important deal-maker/breaker for this game with most people is going to be the controls. They're weird. When prone and crawling, your character (Karl) is slow but he responds to your keyboard commands readily. When crouching or walking, though, Karl has a startup time before he moves or turns. He moves the way a semi truck drives: slow to accelerate and slow to stop once moving, with turning being pretty limited and clunky without extra room. Another analogy: Karl doesn't walk, he ice skates. I'm guessing the developers were trying to capture how human beings build up momentum before reaching top speed, but in gameplay it feels awkward. I took the time to learn and adapt to the controls, but they're not comfortable overall.The missions are very long when I compare them against most FPS games nowadays. Some missions span up to five different wide-open levels, and your saves are limited. I actually like the idea of limiting saves, but overall the difficulty wasn't quite tough enough to pressure me into improving my skills enough to avoid spending my save files. Sniper Elite is a dynamic difficulty game, so it changes itself to suit the player's skill as you play. I chose hard difficulty (Sharpshooter, I think it's called) from the beginning because that allowed me to turn on all of the game mechanics like bullet drop and wind, etc. and I wanted to experience the game as I imagined the developers intended. The game permanently stuck me on max difficulty (""Sniper Elite"" difficulty) after the first level of the very first mission, but I didn't realize this until I was a ways into the second mission. I didn't notice because the game didn't seem any harder. Even with bullet drop, wind, max difficulty A.I., etc. sniping is very forgiving in this game. You can mess up your shot multiple times and the enemies might run and hide, which means you mostly lose time trying to draw a new bead on them, or they might try to shoot back at you. But even at max difficulty, one or two enemies at a medium to long distance won't take you out very quickly, and you can just fire at will until you hit them and they're dead. So much for needing to flee and find a new vantage point once you've been discovered. For as much lip service as the tutorial's narrator pays to how the player must “think like a sniper,” I've solved numerous situations by just grabbing a machine gun and mowing down enemies. I don't even use stealth half the time anymore because the enemies can't stop me consistently unless an entire platoon is firing at me. Or, more likely, the objective for my current mission will fail automatically if I don't use stealth. Otherwise, I play as G.I. Karl, All-American badass. Karl doesn't need to line up the perfect shot because Nazis and NKVD soldiers are rendered impotent shots by the burning flame of democracy in Karl's chest. I've been chucking grenades and even wasted a valuable rocket launcher shot on some dawdling enemies for fun at one point because there wasn't enough reprisal from the game to dissuade me. I almost feel like I've been rewarded for my blatant aggression instead of punished for not using more stealth.In fact, at certain scripted points in the game (there are many) enemies will not pop out of an area you need to progress through unless you get so close that stealth is nearly compromised without immediately running away after triggering the event flag. I would think that I should be able to take advantage of the level design and pick off any inconvenient enemies from afar while moving around the perimeter of the area, but some enemies don't spawn until you actually try to move deeper into the level. I assume the developers did this to keep players on their toes, but it feels antithetical to a sniping game. Example: If two Nazis are going to come sprinting, guns blazing, through an alleyway just as I'm halfway down it after I killed everybody in the area and carefully belly crawled for 50 yards to said alleyway just for extra precaution, what's a sniper like me to do? I whip out my MP-44 and become G.I. Karl, All-American badass, instead. Die, Nazi scum. Should you buy this game? Sure, if you're a fan of WW2 games and open to something more slow-paced and less Call of Duty. I did have fun with the game when it took its stealth seriously and punished me for breaking cover, and when it rewarded me for taking down enemies in single, well-placed shots from afar. On the other hand, don't buy this game if you're intolerant of odd control schemes or looking for a really challenging sniping game. There's some reward for getting a hang of bullet drop, but you're not punished much for being a scrub either so you may feel cheated for trying to master the mechanics when goofing off as G.I. Karl works just as well much of the time. Overall, I don't think the game lives up to its potential, but it's alright for what it is.			"

												I had the opportunity to play Sniper Elite 2 before trying its prequel out and all I can say is that whatever they did in SE2, they must have barely borrowed from the first game (outside of slow motion shots). Not only has the game not aged well but it has mechanics from early FPS games that make absolutely no sense (like a tank magically tracking you no matter regardless if you're in its blind spots etc). I got this game thinking it would be a decent prequel but unfortunately, it's like the hitman 1 to the sniper elite series.Skip it, move on to SE2. You'll thank me later.			"

The game's got a lot of cool features but much of the technical stuff I found is pretty awful which ruins whatever good experience I have with it.The single player difficulty can be customized; wind, gravity, posture, and heart rate can be toggled on and off. The grenade blast radius & ""Empty Lung"" capacity, basically the command to keep your aim steady, can be altered. The AI difficulty can also be set to a preference.The sniper shooting and the mechanics behind it work proper and the kill cam when getting a long distance kill can be satisfying to watch for a short time.Health punishingly goes down fast and you only have a limited amount of saves per mission so you're sort of forced to actually stay on your toes. The (default) controls are a bit odd but they're do-able and can get used to with a bit of time. For firing weapons that isn't your sniper (with the default keys in mind) you have to first equip the weapon then click the fire button once to aim and again to fire. You can't rebind the aim and throw throwables controls (they say ""grenades"" but really the control's for anything you can throw)  as they are locked on to the LMB and RMB. Apparently to throw a throwable you have to first equip it, then hold LMB to ready yourself and then press RMB to throw.To speed up or slow down your movement you have to scroll the mouse wheel up to set the crawl, walk, or run speed to fast and down for slower. You can hold shift as you're moving to dynamically go even slower.When running at full speed and you attempt to decrease your speed to either stop or make a turn the character tends to slide a bit before actually doing something else which may have you stopped a little further from your destination than you'd like. Even when during a sprint and I immediately switch to prone I slide anyway in the direction I was headed towards.With it being a stealth game because the game's about being a sniper and all it should be expected that the AI would be great if not just working proper, which doesn't. For the first mission a lot of the enemies apparently know exactly where I am even when I've done all I can to be stealthy and I know this because despite them being miles away they run towards my direction and as they turn elsewhere their FOVs are always facing me even when I'm behind the cover I carefully guaranteed that no one else would see me go to. Could be that someone minutes ago already saw and I didn't notice but that doesn't excuse what happens after they spot you. When one guy spots you, and even if you kill him the second he noticed you, apparently the entire opposing force that's close has a lock on where you are no matter where you go next. When they spot you there's no way to lose their sight other than to kill them. Not even running long distance where it's empty & safe helps elude them. Plus they don't act like they belong in single player; they act more like badly programmed bots in a multiplayer match who strafe, run around, and prone frequently for whatever reason. If you're trying to take a peak behind a wall or cover as slowly as you can and there's an enemy behind it that's just locked on to you, the instant they see something they could shoot off you they'll open fire. It could be that all this is their way of upping the difficulty if you get spotted but that doesn't really help making the AI look worse when it was already bad and this goes for all the difficulty settings that isn't ""Easy"".In the second mission I thought the idea of concealing your sniper shot sounds with the frequent artillery fire was cool. Apparently way more often than there should be they still have a bad habit of spotting me from long distance despite me crawling as slow as possible on appropriate terrain that increases my camo index. Along with that they also have a habit of seeing me through the tiny cracks & slits that are on the cover for the player to look through. I completed the second mission and then figured I couldn't deal with all this anymore.I really wanted to like it for the cool sniper play but the slip-&-slide mechanics the player has and potentially omniscient AI turn me off greatly.

												I wanted to say that this game was good, but... the overlay pop-ups... OH GAWD THE OVERLAY POP-UPS. Never have I been more frustrated playing a game in my life. Good gameplay, when you CAN play, but just due to the horrible ""tip"" design, I say stay away! (Maybe they fixed it in later games..) Also, the audio levels you set in the game (after boomingly loud music, you have to listen to as you fight against the game in order to get to the Audio settings screen just to change) don't pan over the main menu, or ANY cutscenes. So.. yeah. Voice-chatting and such is a no-go when playing this one, basically. Totally bad execution of overlays and audio settings, but the mechanics of game-play are pretty good.If not but for the horrible menu/overlay/settings issues, I would recommend it. Sadly, I can't.

												Don't understand the positive reviews from stealth fans. This is a really rough quality game. It's hard, but if you want realistic stealth that's a good thing... but I don't actually think this is realistic. I don't find the guards' hearing or observational skills at all realistic, in many cases over sensitive, and sometimes too quick to be aggressive. And that's not a complaint because it makes it hard. It's a complaint because it feels like cheap AI, and therefore like a bad game. Like I said, if a stealth game is hard due to realism, great. If it's hard because it's just arbitrarily coded that way, that's not realistic, and that to me is not a good stealth game.If you want an old game with old graphics that's actually closer to realistic stealth, but is still old fashioned enough that you can still pretend to yourself that because it's old it's therefore hard and therefore good, get Death To Spies.

If only they had playtested the game and then said ""What will people think of this in 6 months?"" I the answer to that question is that people will think that it is absolute [Redacted] then no, you should not make the game!

												I tried to like this game, I really did, but I really can't. When my friend told me about Sniper Elite, I was intrigued; a stealth based game revolving around sniping. It looked like a mix of a shooter and Thief, and when I did enjoy it for the first hour or so... then things started cropping up that really ruined this game for me.The first problem was when I started dying from enemies shooting through solid objects... I was sneaking around and got jumped from about 20 paces away from an enemy shooting through a solid block!The second issue is when I had to deal with a T-34 tank by shooting it's fuel cap. Now, I don't know very much about military hardware, but I know a tank would never have such a glaring weakness: the ability to kill a tank with a single bullet is ridiculous. Thats why they have anti-tank munitions. Snipers are NOT tank killers!Adding to issue 2: later I had to deal with an enemy tank attacking a friendly position. All I had was a stack of TNT... I thought that all I could do is use it to break a track and immobilize that tank. When I used the TNT (on the side of the tank) the enemy tank exploded! Ridiculous! Tanks are NOT that fragile. Again, snipers are NOT tank killers!The last issue that ended my interest in this game is the cyborg-like vision of the enemies. I heard that this game had a heavy stealth aspect and so I treated it accordingly. I was very careful using cover, obstructions, and crawling as much as needed to be stealthy, even so more often than not the enemy would find me long before I could find them. Even when using my binoculars/sniper scope the enemy is far too difficult to see, whereas the enemy can/will shoot at you even when they're supposedly distracted in a battle.I wish I could get a refund. As stealth titles go Sniper Elite is no Thief: The Dark Project. "

This game would probably have been good if I learned of it when it had come out, and not years later. Most people these days probably discover it because it's sort of the first installment in the series, but don't bother with it. It has nothing to do with the sequel, and is quite unplayable by modern standards. I'm sure it was a good game once, but as I stated above, I got to it too late, it feels like playing an old shooter, only too tedious.			"

												This is the most unfocused and confused games I have ever played. It introduces itself as a sniping game. Sure, there are plenty of opportunities for that, but this entire system gets yanked down when it suddenly - and with no real sensible countermeasures - confronts you with super up close threats with zero warning. A great number of times I would sneak around a corner only to find an enemy already psychic-ly aware of my presence. This happened MANY times. It advertises stealth and sneaky, but then often forces you into the classic run-and-gun. NOT a good sniping game. A mediocre, average shooter with needlessly large maps that offer little protection from omniscient enemy snipers and berserking machine gunners.3/10 DO NOT BUY			"

Graphics, sounds, voice acting and even gameplay are all sub-par. Only cool moment is when your sniping enemies far ahead and see the slow-motion bullet hit the head. Except that, nothing really noteworthy about Sniper Elite.It was really cheap (2,50$) when I acquired it however, keep your hard earned cash and spend it on other games... OR for the promising sequel (well, sequel or SE Version 2)!I really hope the next iteration lives up to expectations!5.0 / 10			"

												A game for the professional elite snipers among us. This is a game that challenges your wit, cunning and aim all at the same time. It is pretty easy in the first levels, but gets drastically more challenging as the levels progress. Then there's bullet cam for those cool shots you pull off...for the win.Not a game for $10, but if it ever comes below $5, it's a damn great buy, but only if you have paitience to throw caution to the wind. (No seriously, the wind has effect)			"

												Alright so, I really haven't played much, and I die alot....But that is beside the point.If you are impatient, this game isn't for you.However, if you love a challenge and if you are tired of the normal ""shoot-them-up"" combat games, then this game is a good deal.  The rules of engagement are simple: kill, and don't be seen.  If you run into combat, you will die.  If you get pinned in and forget to set your traps....you will die.  If you forgot to scout with your binoculars and missed the eight soldiers around that truck...yeah you will die.Yet, even with the easy death, the game is still doable.  It takes lots of practice and patience...and when you get the gravity down to blow up a truck, and then take out a sniper on a roof before anyone knows where you are, then it's time to up the difficulty and play with wind.

												A wonderful game that keeps giving. If you ever wanted to be a sniper in WWII then this is the game for you. It has bullet flight and drop. It has a multiplayer that is still active and fun to play around with. The graphics are just great for this game, it really draws you into the action. The controls can be tricky if your doing default so make sure to use your own set-up. The story is great and there are a number of missions with alot of things to do. The action never stops, you can be guns free or pick off your enemy from a distance. The slow motion bullet follow is fun to watch. The overall game is great! If you ever wanted to be a sniper then Sniper Elite is the game for you!			"

												I am psychic: when Keigo bought this game for me I decided that it was ♥♥♥♥ before it even finished loading. Using my newfound psychic powers I quickly manipulated the people around me to simultaneously win three lotteries and take over the Foundation in the Terminus system. What a bunch of losers those guys turned out to be, eh? With my millions of dollars, advanced technology and amazing psychic brain filled with magic brain juices I went on a trek to the stars. Later, Gene Roddenberry (who was my first mate) documented my tales in film. As soon as I discovered that he was profitting off of my exploits I destroyed every last copy, and legally forbade him from doing anything with his life except for making TV shows of the exact opposite of my trek. At least I'm pretty sure that's the only explanation for Star Trek Voyager that I can live with.			"

												7/10. Enjoyable and satisfying game. Solid controls for movement but a bit annoying getting inventory items in a pinch. The stealth gameplay is really good. It's important to sneak around when moving through open areas. The AI is sometimes too smart with enemy snipers who spot you a bit too quickly (you really have keep to cover). Finding myself dying often and having to replay certain parts of the missions multiple times, but it doesn't bother me because it forces me to play smarter. Runs great on my 5 year old laptop. Recommend.			"

												I can't really recommend this game unless you get it for 1$ or bundled. I remember this one back in 2005 when it was regularly featured on Gamer.tv which used to air on an obscure channel called Now (how I miss that show). The game was built for the PS2 which explains the outdated graphic engine. And I say outdated because this was a year after Farcry, Doom 3, Painkiller and Halflife 2 (2004-That was the best year for PC shooters). But anyway the graphics are decent...neat skyboxes, great depressing atmosphere without being overly gritty.Used to give a F**k about this game as I was around 18 when it released and upgraded my PC to play the then top of the line games as mentioned above. Man! it's a decade later and I decided to buy this along with the other two sequels. As a man almost in his 30's now, You would think I would really go crazy with this game in a pseudo intellectual way...World War, History etc.Turns out it's an action-stealth game with the sniping simulator as a pretext. Well all that's fine, it plays out more or less like a Dishonoured where you can stick by a rule or just go around on a murderous rampage. Control-wise there is a lot of Splinter Cell influence. In terms of realism it's in between arcade and simulation leaning more towards arcade. Just don't expect an early Ghost Recon or Rainbox Six(1998). Sniper Elite can get pretty repitative, with very little to shake things up. The game is lengthy which in this case, doesn't do any good. It faces the same problem as many Modern games, too many ideas thrown in...few good, few excecuted properly. Rather than be a sniper centric game, it tries hard to be alot more, hence rather than getting one thing right, ends up being sup-par in every aspect. Lets take a look a great idea- Tripwire traps, Awesome! Excecution? They had to create a situation for you to use them or you just forget about them. I guess the biggest drawback here is age, see this game was crafted to be a Modern game, and unlike retro games and classic games...this one won't age well. It was meant to be played and disposed , There was another game that released in this year for the same platform and that was Shadow of The Colossus, I still think about that game till this day. That's what made it a classic. And this? not even a bargain bin classic. Back in 2005 I would give this a 6/10. Today I would highly recommend getting it bundled and giving it 4 hours of gameplay to see if you like it. I had a bit of fun with this one and it's way more entertaining and ambitious than a modern day Call of Duty.			"

												I love realistic sniper games.  Best sniper games are usually multiplayer military sims and none of the single players.  This is the best single player sniper game out there for a long span.  Crank the settings to hard core and enjoy for a more realistic experience.  Run and gun players should take a pass - sniping requires a lot of patience and tactical planning.  Those who like stealth and tactics combined with shooters should pick this up.  Graphics are dated but very playable.  My hope is that Sniper Elite 2 will measure up and take on the mantle of this classic.			"

												The fact that you don't have this game is literally shameful.  There is no justification.  This game, put simply, blows minds.  And I mean this literally, as within seconds, you'll be blowing minds off with bullets like it's dinner at the Oswald house.  The slow motion bullet-cam feature is a sniper fan's dream come true.  And the fact that you can accurately flank and distract opponents without them psychically ""figuring it out"" is glorious to behold.  Shoot a guy from one place, run around the level, approach from another angle, hide in a pillar box, watch him run around like a spaz, blow his head off.  It really is up to you and the levels are interesting enough to keep you going.  I absolutely adore this game, and the sequel is on my ""must purchase full price or lose respect for myself"" list.  In short, WHY HAVEN'T YOU BOUGHT THIS YET?  OH GOD...			"

												Sniper Elite is your basic intro into a sniper's gunnery world. I've found very little deflection in windage affecting cross-drift of the round - enabling me to make 200 Meter or so headshots without a significant problem.Bear in mind that this is an old game and one of the first 'proper' sniping games... dont bash this game after playing more modern sniper games. Enjoy the 'retro' feel of this early title... and remember it for what it is...RETRO.Its a shame that I got this after the multi-player on-line servers had shutdown, but that doesn't stop you playing via LAN I should think... worth an afternoon to realize how far the genre has developed... a must have for your war library at a couple of bucks.Missions are fairly linear and the AI is not challenging, though it does get a tad ridiculous when enemy soldiers show eagle-eyed propensity to detect you from dozens of meters away.Oftentimes a whizz of a close-passing round will make me hit the dirt and spend some time reallocating to find out the shooters location... unlike other reviews who claim that this game has limited ammo... I always find myself clearing levels with supplied ammo untouched...this is a SNIPER game after all...not DOOM II!If you are an all-guns blazing type...move on. if you like to think over your shot, watch your target patrol/do his thing before committing to the trigger... come on in.Bullet time is decidedly retro. Its like finding gamp's rusty old musket and cleaning it out to fire a few rounds to take you back to yesteryear... cant wait to clear this and move on to the other two successors I also bought. Hopefully, like wine, this series gets better with time...Buy it on sale. 67/100.			"

												Today I will be reviewing the game sniper elite I got the game about a week ago and wanted to give my first glimpse of what I thought about it so that that is what I’m doing today please excuse any grammar or punctuation as this is my first review and my full game review will be much betterThe graphicsThe graphics of this game are extremely good for its time the characters actually show some realism instead of just blocky 3d models like some game like rainbow six 3 the explosions guns and buildings look not realistic but closer than most games so there pretty good for this eraGameplay the gameplay is smooth but on the computer there are so many controls that it is easy to get mixed up the defaults are tricky but my advice with dealing with enemies is if you don’t want to get shot and cry until you can cry no more I say stay the hell down and keep your distance the combat is versatile with a lot of weapons realistic switching and excellent slow mo shots which just make this game so uniqueSoundsHe sounds are good with some realistic ww2 sounds but are a bit basic as there is not a lot of dialogue or any sound except the shots and the backgroundFeaturesNow this is the best part the features first let’s talk about what effects the bullet gravity wind hart rate all effect where the bullets going to hit which gives it more realism then most other games another feature that I enjoyed was the slow mo shots it gave you a 3rd person view of the bullet and then a look at where it hit then giving you a score of how far if the target was moving and stuff like thatOverall This game is great on my first glimpse and with the gameplay it’s just perfect for what it is there are a few things that could be better but I recommend this game if you are a diehard sniper ScoresGraphics 7.8Gameplay 8.1Sound 6.9Features 8.5Overall 8Thx for reading  "

												This game. Well, i caught the 80 dollar pack when it was on sale for 16 dollars. After a couple hours of gameplay, it's a pretty good game. I guess since i see other people, i will make some pros and cons.PROS: - Pretty solid gameplay- Online is still supported- Got a semi solid game network behind it (GameSpy)- Will pretty much run on anythingCONS:- Looks like it could be ran off a GameCube (This was like 2005 so you can give them some slack)- Old gameThats about it. I would say 9/10			"

So many missions & everytime you think you are done you find one more to go but in an interesting surprising way .. Totally recommend buying it. Enjoy!			"
