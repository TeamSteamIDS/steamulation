The Ten Commandments of the Assassin's Creed:1) No running or you will be killed on sight.2) No galloping or you will be killed on sight.3) No walking on the roof or you will be killed on sight.4) Dirty thief! I'll have your hand for that!5) No loitering in the guard's treasured personal space for more than two seconds or guess what?You will be killed on sight.6) No swimming or...never mind, you'll die anyway.7) No bumping into people or you will be killed on sight.8) No climbing buildings or you will be killed on sight.9) If you don't slouch and leave one hand hanging while trotting at a snail's pace on your horse, you will be killed on sight.10) They say it is a crusade! But a crusade for what? Ignorance? Violence? Infidel! I'll have your hand for that!Silliness aside, take these with a sackful of salt, as they are very subjective:Story: 7.0/10Interesting, but doesn't tug too hard on those heartstrings.Setting: 8.5/10If you're a history buff, you are in for a ride. The Holy Land! The Third Crusade! Islam and Christianity butting heads! Ancient conspiracies! Illuminati! (well, not exactly, but close enough) Violence! Madness! Infidel! I'll have your hand for that!Art style: 8.0/10Nothing much to shout about, but if I walked through Syria eight hundred years ago, I think this would be pretty accurate.Gameplay: 6.5/10If you are not a patient person, don't buy this game. Many a time I have pounded the table because something was tedious or inscrutably difficult. However, it wasn't so bad as to keep me from completing the game. Bringing some grey matter with you while playing is highly recommended.Overall enjoyment: 7.5/10It's not a bad game, but it's not overwhelmingly awesome either. My main sticking point is in the gameplay. However, if you can tolerate that, I think you might like this classic.			"

												Assassin's Creed is an action-adventure stealth game with open world environment from Ubisoft.The first of the series, this game tells the story of Desmond Miles, an assassin descendant who tried to escape his life as an assassin and try to live like normal people. Instead he got kidnapped by the Abstergo Industries. There, his real adventure begins. Desmond is forced to interface with the Animus, a device that is capable to replay genetic memories of the user's ancestors. The Abstergo seeks to uncover information about Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, a legendary assassin from the Third Crusade.The gameplay of Assassin's Creed is quite interesting but also very repetitive and linear. It's repetitive because before you assassination missions begin, you need to conduct some side mission to get information for your main mission. The side mission include pickpocketing, eavesdropping, interogation and completing various task of your fellow assassin's which include, killing guards, race or flag capturing. You will do those side missions everytime you're going to assassinate someone. The good part is, you are free to choose which side mission you want to complete, only 3 from 6 side missions needed for the main missions to unlock. The freedom of the game is also quite big. You can explore the whole city of Damascus, Acre and Jerusalem. Kill guards from behind, help civilian from rogue soldiers, find and kill templar soldiers or climb a tower and perform a leap of faith. You can travel from a city to another city with horses. Despite all these freedom, the game is till linear.The graphics are beautiful and amazingly detailed. The textures are just, amazing. The animation are also very great. The physics effect are also good, you can watch dead guard roll over the rooftops and eventually fall to the ground. The lightning is perfect too. The environment combined with the AI make the game feels more alive with the civilians walking around, the guards patrolling about and some beggars will try to annoy you.Assassin's Creed is a good start if you want to dive into the world of Assassin's Creed series as this game contains the foundation of the whole story. Even with linear story, you still have the freedom to do many things in this game. I recommend this.Rating 8/10			"

												- Personal Rating: ""Single Playthrough"" - Traditional Rating: ""7 / 10""The first game in the now very popular Assassin's Creed franchise. While this entry wasn't as popular as the following sequels, it's still a pretty decent game even now in it's own right. In this entry, you play as the arrogant Altair (and Desmond controlling him through a machine called ""The Animus"") as he is forced to recover his original rank among the Brotherhood after a mission gone wrong. Now, bearing in the mind that this IS the first game in the series - the game has two ""stances"" combat and movement. In movement, there are further two stances - Blended mode, movement is slower but makes you less conspicuous, even less so if you use the ""Blend"" command and then there's the ""Free Run"" mode, where you hold down a key/button and movement will be much faster and will be able to automatically scale walls, jump from buildings, etc as well as do a more ""flashy"" assassination maneuver. The combat stance is accessed when you are locking on to an enemy and have a weapon drawn. By holding the same key/button you use for ""Freerun"" is the same key you use to block incoming enemy attacks, the rest of the moveset is a your standard attack, grapple and step (dodge) - by holding the block key and pressing the attack key will initiate the Counter animation (when unlocked). It's not a very complex system but it works and is fun to experiment with.Altair has with him an arsenal that gets bigger as you progress through the game (Yes story, not collectibles). You start out with a standard sword and of course your handy Hidden Blade. Later on, you gain the (overpowered) throwing daggers and a better standard sword. Now I made a mention of the daggers per se because you will be using these a LOT. They one shot enemies off combat or if you're far away from them, they work on Assassination targets fights by decreasing their health by quite a lot and staving regular enemies off easy.Now the real meat of the game is, of course, exploration and assassinations. Each city and the road in between them is filled with bustling life that looks and feels very natural as well as enemies and NPCs react to what you're doing very realistically - like say if you're scaling a wall, an NPC will say something according to it. Every city, like Jerusalem, Acre, etc - is very detailed themselves and is a visual treat to see. The enemies and NPC models are pretty well varied across each city with minor details changed up in faces to distinguish some people from others, their facial expressions and the such are also pretty decent, though not as good as Altair's. As far as your objectives in the game go... it's nothing very interesting, at all. Each city has about the same objectives everytime you're sent on an Assassination mission - you're forced to climb up to Synchronization points scattered through that city until you find ""Investigation"" missions, which serve more as game padding than anything else in my opinion because they aren't varied enough. Two of them involving fellow assassin's have you racing from Point A to point B within an alloted amount of time, another has you ""stealth"" killing special enemies - other missions involve ""Interrogations, which have you following an NPC around till you feel it's a correct time to beat the information out of that person, another has you ""Eavesdropping"", a mission that has you merely sit on a bench and listen to two NPC babble on, and one that involves listening to NPCs babble on about some special item, whom which you ""Pickpocket"" from them. You only need atleast 2 or 3 out of the usual 6 per Assassination Mission to actually access the Assassination mission. And this process will repeat about 9 or so times throughout the ENTIRE game. One issue I had with the game was that it felt a little too random at times. There were times where I failed an investigation mission, had to kill the enemies or die so I could restart it merely because there was a group of enemies walking by that for some reason notice you while others don't. It was irritating. - However the actual assassination missions are amazing, and easily the most fun you will have in the game. You can complete most assassination missions without being seen and resorting to combat since there's no set timer and the game forces you to think your options through and act accordingly. Some later missions sadly force you to resort to combat, which lessens the impact the assassination has because it's a bit random, you can be fighting a group of enemies and then another second when you counter ANOTHER enemy, you'll see Altair jump on top of the target and kill him randomly.An issue I did have with the game that may put off a lot of people - combat. The combat is generally really slow and clunky and is really random. At first, the enemies behave pretty predictably and are easy to kill - more so considering that they actually wait until you kill someone else first and just stare at you brutally murdering them THEN decide to attack you, or some enemies actually flinch allowing for an easy chain kill - then they start countering your moves as enemies get stronger. Unlike what you may read around, no, later on in the game, most counters will NOT one hit kill enemies, Altair may just push them back and you have to do that killing yourself by attacking the downed enemy. Something that I felt was rather random was sometimes the counters don't seem to work outright, and you end up taking more damage than what you needed to, sometimes because of things outside your control. Later on aswell, the enemies take a liking to grappling you a LOT and that can get REALLY annoying. Not to even mention that you CANNOT hit the boss enemies when they are grounded. The AI is also really stupid - in closed areas of the game, if you get low on health, just run circles around the enemies until you get some health back.All in all though, I had fun with the game. I actually do recommend it lightly to those that enjoy the thrill that is careful preparation and to those that love seeing worlds that feel alive. Annoyances like the NPC beggars (whom will actually block movement sometimes and are EXTREMELY annoying), the random and clunky combat, and the repetitiveness of the Investigation missions will seem more forgetable after you get to the better parts of the game. Altair becomes a more likeable character and the story itself, while not as clear (sequels) will actually keep you wanting to see more of what the game can offer - and of course the amazing Assassination Missions, the reason you're playing this game.Edit: I forgot to mention, this game DOES have collectibles in the forms of Flags scattered across the world. I personally didn't go after them in the game as they have no real incentive or motive to collect them other than for collectionists' sake.			"

												Assassin's Creed came out in 2007 and here I am 7 years later playing this game for the first time. I must say that I have purchased it during the sale but I can tell you right now that its worth the full price. Not to mention it's only like $10 anyway! So what's so fun about it you might ask. Let me tell you. After you finally start running around and killing the enemies the game becomes fun! I have once spent 80% the mission just hunting the guards and doing all the other random things. For me, the selling part of this game is running around and jumping on the rooftops. Controls. I understand that this game was ported from a console so controls for PC only users will be funny. I didn't not try to reset them because they are still well put. But, its not your normal WASD + ctrl and space. You will just have to get used to that. While playing this game you don't often notice the sound effects and the music, but I can tell that it plays its part in delivering the whole picture very well. Its nothing impressive, but what is important that it does not spoil the experience and only enchants it. Although I have not tried, but I can see myself actually playing some other music while running around the city. The very first time I ran this game was actually in 2007. The computer I was running it on couldn't even handle it. That is partially the reason why I only came back to the game now. At the time of release the graphics very amazing. The foggy city environment impressed me in particular. The models of characters are very well made as well, buildings are quite detailed. Nothing really to complain about as 7 years later it still looks good. You might say, what an unfair review, where are the negative things? Well they are here as per any game. For example I don't quite like how character moves sometimes and how he cant do certain jumps and things. But its all negligible I think. Oh, and once I flew from my horse really high. The worst thing is that it only saves your game when you have completed something which can be quite an annoyance. The story is not all there is to do. You can actually explore the cities to find some random flags. I am not too sure what they going to give you at the end, but there's quite a number of them to be found and  they also might be in places where you wont be able to reach from the first time. So a few more challenges. Oh and I almost forgot to mention the Templars. They are very hard to deal with, but there are always ways to abuse the system( find out for yourself). Re-playability is low in my opinion, because once you finish this game you can get the next one and then the next one and so on. You will be playing the same game but with the different filling inside. So in overall, I think the developers made a externally good game( which evolved into a big sequence of games). I would recommend this game to pretty much anybody.			"

												*Jim Carrey* I like it a lot.I had heard a lot of good and bad things about this particular game in the franchise which made me a little unsure on whether or not I was going to enjoy it. Which would have been pretty bad if I didn’t seeing as I binge traded for pretty much the whole franchise. The main impression I got from people was that the story was good but the gameplay was repetitive to the point of you just wanting to get to the end ASAP. Which, in ways, it was repetitive. But for me it was more than tolerable. The story kept me interested enough for me to not really mind all that much. It has a “Batman Arkham City” feel to it. Or at least for me it did. The world is open but there are a limited range of activities you can actually do.Story wise, I enjoyed it! I constantly wanted to know what was going on and I wanted answers, dang nab it! At points it messed with my head, made me think of all kinds of weird possible plot twists and weird philosophical theories on truth and reality. Which is great! Might just be me but you gotta love games that poke at your brain a little. There was a whole element to the game that kind of comes up in-between chapters that I didn’t even know existed. You don’t really see that side to it in the trailers so that was interesting to me.I played through this with (well, at the same time as) a friend whilst on call and from the profanity that came from my mouth and just how angry I was getting at times it wouldn’t surprise me if he thought I hated this game. A few times I did actually shout “OH MY GOD I HATE THIS GAME”. But it was lies! Point being that even though I raged quite a lot, I still really enjoyed it.The mechanics for the game are great, the parkour kind of free-running stuff is really fun when it’s not being annoying (although you get used to it), the combat is fun but was the main part I raged at to be honest. (Probably just horrific at it). The assassin/stealth parts of the game are also really good. Makes you feel all badass being able to be really sneakily stealth kill some suckra then free-run your way out of it.One thing I kept in mind the whole time whilst playing this game was that this game is pretty darn old. It was released around 2007 or somewhere around there. I think it’s been touched up since then, but still for how old it is especially, it’s a good game.All in all, I like it and I look forward to continuing the franchise!TL;DR : Gameplay is somewhat repetitive (although it’s not that bad) but it makes up for that with an interesting story. Awesome stealth/assassin/parkour/combat mechanics and all around an awesome game for how old it’s getting these days. Definitely worth trying this. "

												Assassin’s Creed was released for consoles amidst a sea of controversy. Despite its critical praises for its beautifully designed locales and fresh storytelling perspective, it was slammed by some for being too repetitive. Every mission is carried out in the same manner: interrogate an informant, pickpocket a citizen, and eavesdrop on a conversation. These actions would lead towards an assassination, which would complete a mission: rinse and repeat.Assassin’s Creed puts you in the shoes of an assassin named Altaïr and takes place in the Holy Land during the Third Crusade in 1191 AD. Altaïr is the ancestor of modern day bartender Desmond Miles. Desmond was taken in by a mysterious organization for questioning, and strapped into a device called an Animus machine, which allows the user to revisit his ancestor’s past memories.The concept of the game is quite out there, but it does work. Every so often Desmond will have to “take a break” from the machine, and you’ll get to walk around in the real world to learn a bit of history behind Desmond’s family tree, as well as the true intentions of the organization holding him. The story progresses in a manner that simply draws you in.Surprisingly, Assassin’s Creed breaks the action game trend and delivers exquisite dialogue and voice acting. Despite the fact that Altaïr clearly has an American accent, his voice actor delivers his lines with an uneasy seriousness to them, which allows you to take the character seriously, and draws you closer to the game’s world. The free-running controls are excellent. If I had one complaint, it would be that they were too easy to use. Parkouring and climbing is almost automatic when you’re sprinting, which makes some sections too easy.Combat-wise, Assassin’s Creed doesn’t do anything revolutionary, but it gets the job done for the most part. Battles are comprised of a simple system of blocking, striking, and countering.Combat itself is pretty fun, even if it’s not all that complicated. The biggest complaint against Assassin’s Creed is the similar manner in which missions are conducted. There are four towns in the game, and one hub world. Each town has a poor, middle-class, and rich area, and you will visit each during the course of the game to murder a specific target. The events that lead up to the actual kill are always the same, but the confrontations are vastly different from one another.If you can get past the game's mission-based structure and lack of replay value for the common gamer, you'll find an epic tale of betrayal and intrigue in Assassin's Creed that really shouldn't be missed.Overall 8/10.

A world both gorgeous & fun to traverse // Recommended for fans of both open-world and stealth adventures+ As the first game of the franchise, it is both novel in concept and scope of narrative+ Platforming elements are extremely polished and satisfying; climbing is simple in practice and is competently animated+ Environments are large, detailed and absolutely gorgeous+ Voice-acting (with one notable oversight, addressed below) is excellent; general sound-design, too, is strikingly original+ UI, though it breaks the immersion a bit, is practical and aesthetically pleasing+ Bissfully short load-times; game's engine runs smoothly and efficiently+ Quick-travel is available as the explorable areas increase+ Swordplay, though not as emphasized as a gameplay element, is still quite cinematic and enjoyable+ Myriad collectibles and viewpoints to unlock, scattered throughout the world+ Stalking targets is broken down into a series of minigames; though tragically un-varied (there are only 6 variations), they nonetheless do their part to uphold immersion- Exiting the game requires movement through 3 or 4 menu screens; quitting a game has never been so frustrating- Segments revolving around Desmond (in the year 2012) often seem to drag on well beyond what is required to set up that angle of the plot; seriously breaks up the pacing- Beyond the drive to get a 100% save file, there is little incentive to replay after a successful playthrough- Limited tangible incentive to explore and collect; doing so is done so for its own sake- Protagonist's voiceover is decidedly American, in stark contrast to the authentic accents of virtually all other characters; massive break in immersionLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												TL:DR? See ConclusionNote: This being the first game in the franchise, I will review it as if the sequels did not exist.INTRODUCTION:Assassin's Creed is the first title of the popular Ubisoft Franchise of the same name. It is a semi-sandbox, action-adventure-stealth game set in the Holy Lands during the medieval period, more specifically, during the Crusades. It was originally released for the consoles back in 2007 with a PC release the following year.The game places you in the shoes of Desmond Miles who, using a machine called the Animus, accesses the genetic memory of his ancestor Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad in an attempt to retrace a series of events that would lead him to an unknown artifact called “Piece of Eden”. Journey across the war torn Holy Lands and watch history unfold as every action Altaïr makes, unravels another piece of a greater mystery and conspiracy that stretches across several generations.PROS:+ Good Storytelling with a refreshing mix of historical, and sci-fi elements.+ Good combat, stealth and core gameplay mechanic+ Graphically beautiful despite its age at the time of this review+ World and level design are well done+ Beautiful atmospheric surroundings+ Lots of NPCs which make the Holy Land feel alive and immersive+ Interesting and memorable characters+ Good sound design and voice acting+ Top notch animation quality+ Large semi-non-linear map to explore+ Target assassinations can be completed in several ways+ No Uplay account requirementCONS:- Combat becomes repetitive- Counter-attack can be seriously abused- Not much to do outside the Animus (while you're Desmond Miles)- Useless and unrewarding collectibles which results in...(see next con)- Not much incentive to explore the vast game world- No progression system to speak of (not a lot of upgrades or weapon variation)- Master Assassin Altaïr cannot swim (living in the desert is not an excuse)- Lepers and BeggarsCONCLUSION:Assassin's Creed is a good game with a very interesting story which mixes together historical background and sci-fi elements. It has a vast atmospheric world and together with the beautiful graphics and sound design, makes for an enjoyable experience. I kinda wish they had more rewarding side missions though. Combat is fun, stealth is satisfying and the core mechanic, although it can feel repetitive at times, rarely gets boring.Overall its GOOD and a GOOD BUY. As it stands, buying the game at full price is not bad but since the game goes on sale frequently, I suggest waiting. It's a good game to have in your library as a collector's item if anything else.---------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												Yet another PC port by Ubisoft, Assassin's Creed is crazy fun if you know what you're doing.The story behind this Assassin vs Templar universe begins here, but it curiously takes place concurrently in the present day as well as in the past. On the one hand, we have master assassin Altair letting his inflated ego get the better of him, causing him to slip up in a big way, breaking all three of the Creed's most sacred tenets. We follow his path to redemption through the task of 9 assassinations - a task that sees Altair change who he is for the better of all in the guild.The story of the present day centres on Desmond Miles. This story is intermittent at best, as the majority of the game is played out in Altair's time, but to sum it up, he has been captured and forced to relive Altair's memories through a device called an Animus, able to 'view' the genetic memories of the occupant. For those that haven't played, there are spoilers, so I won't go into the details.The strange dual-story actually works quite well, as subsequent games have proven in their popularity. I have played all games up to and including AC3, so in hindsight this game set the scene well for future sequels.Controls can be clunky at times. It's easy to get used to, but something simple like running at top speed requires W for moving forward, holding down right click on the mouse to change into High Profile (think: more obvious to be spotted) actions, the space bar as well to hit the sprint and auto jump at building edges or to jump over gaps automatically... and to top it off you have to hit Shift if you want to catch yourself with a grab if you don't quite make the jump. This is an extreme case though, and it should be noted that you are encouraged to move slowly and take your time with your movements so as to not arouse suspicion from guards.But wait, there's more! Running and jumping - hell even walking and jumping, is made still more ridiculous by the fact that half the time you'll end up somewhere you didn't want to go, or weren't aiming for. Case in point: walking down an alley, you suddenly decide you want to climb the walls and windows up to the rooftops. You turn around and start a run up to the wall so that you'll start climbing when you reach it... only there's this fence you'll brush past on your way there. By some fluke or quirk of fate you'll find yourself climbing the fence instead... even though the fence is at the same level as you are. You'll find yourself hanging on to the end of this fence for dear life... because you wouldn't want to fall! The ground is literally right at your feet. Naturally you'll agree with onlookers when they start muttering ""Somebody should stop him, before he hurts himself"" and ""What a fool!""So movement can be either really funny or really frustrating depending on the situation. Weapons consist of fists (useful for getting information out of people), swords, knives, and of course the signature hidden blade we all know and love. <3 You'll find there's a pretty even spread of circumstances for using these, and once you get the counter-kill and grab-counter moves combat will be nothing more than an annoying trifle on your way to the next part in the story.Being the 'assassin'-type game that it is, I find it disappointing that everything so easily turns into a bloodbath. Check my screenshots if you don't believe me. Whether it's a mission assassination or just trying to walk past a patrol, you'll soon discover people from all over the world want to throw themselves on your sword. Sometimes it takes as much as twenty bodies on the ground before your opponents realise they can't win too, and then even after you wipe out a massive group and finally become anonymous again, another patrol comes around a corner and the whole thing starts all over again. I open the map sometimes just to see if the city population changes - I'm sure I killed that many.Gameplay consists of various mission types and collectibles in addition to the main 9 assassination missions. In order to 'access the memories' you have to do research about your targets - these can consist of taking out rooftop archers for a brother assassin that can't do it for some reason or another; a race; eavesdropping; punching up the town crier for info, then killing him anyway ^_^; pickpocket missions, and a couple of others. The assassinations themselves, while I appreciate the variety of set-ups and environs, don't satisfy me as much as they could have. Unlike any nuffie guard you could off then walk away without being detected (even in front of other guards, I might add), every single core mission sees you enter these weird nowhere places where time doesn't seem to flow and you can talk to your victim regardless of the fact you just stabbed him in the neck. Afterwards you employ the 'run like hell' strategy, because somehow the whole city knows what you've done even before you get there. And there's about twenty guards in hot pursuit, because most times you dont have the opportunity to clear the area before you go in for the kill (not without alerting your mark anyway).Like I said, the game is a blood bath, with far too much combat and contrived scenes, and not enough stealth.The graphics are passable for it's age, although I find the colour palette lacking. Jerusalem is all grey, Damascus is all terracotta, and I think Acre is a different shade of grey. To be fair Damascus is pleasant, it was definitely my favourite of all the areas. Inside the Masyaf fortress is a close second.I think the variety of characters is good. There are the drunks, wandering aimlessly through the streets and somehow always knowing when Altair is around so they can push him around. The town criers and their propoganda speeches will stay with you well after you finish playing (not in a good way). The beggars can get really, really, really annoying, but remember you can punch them when guards aren't alerted - they won't do anything. ""No! You don't understand - I'm poor and sick and HUNGRY!"" *BAM* Let's face it, everyone punches beggars.Where the game really shines for me is its soundtrack. Especially when everything goes to hell and everyone knows you're a villain - because the music will go crazy! The chase and combat music during the core missions simply cannot be beat, I believe it's Access the Animus. It's worth a listen to. There are other great tracks as well - all done by Jesper Kyd, notorious for his awesome work on various games now. I highly recommend checking him out.Despite the problems I encountered, the freezes, glitched collectibles (!*$@# FLAGS!), crazy amount of guard killing and stupid auto-jumping ... I had loads of fun. And I confess the present-day story had me not just intrigued, but hooked. Perhaps it'll hook you too.			"

												Did you ever think to yourself...  ""Wow, I wish I could be an assassin,"" indiscriminately executing evil doers and fiends alike?  I certainly know the answer to that question for myself was a passionate yes!  Occasionally as a child I would don a white sheet around my neck, painted with a red cross.  I would stealthily sneak around  my living room, surprising my family members with a cardboard dagger, I created from a produce box..  I would pounce from behind the couch and pretend to slash my father, my mother, my brothers, it didn't matter who.  Ahh those glorious days when I was a wee lad and my imagination could run wild for hours.. or until the ADHD compelled me to find something else to do.Well Assassins Creed may be just the game to fill your childhood role-playing fantasy's in reality.. after all it's far better and cheaper than trying to actually become an assassin am I rite?  To start off with it needs to be said that Assassin Creed is the grand daddy of the Creed series, so the AI is kind of dumb and undeveloped, the game play is repetitive and the combat is slightly boring.  Yes I said it Assassin Creed on paper isn't a very good game at all....  I'm talking in 2016, where as in 2008 when the game came out it was fresh and new, so quite a few of the issues which plague the game were forgivable.  It wouldn't be a good review if I left out that the game feels very dated now.THE STORY Starts you off as Altair an assassin on a mission, I won't spoil what you're after, but if you put two and two together you'll figure it out (It's pretty much a tutorial getting you familiar with the game..)  After the fairly short tutorial mission you'll awaken to find yourself in the shoes of a man named Desmond Miles..  He's being held hostage and forced to enter the Animus, a machine which can somehow bring out the memories of your ancestors.. I won't go into anymore detail as I wouldn't want to spoil the fun of discovering the story. THE GAMEPLAYThis is the meat and potatoes of any game, the actual game play.  In Assassin Creed unfortunately the gameplay gets rather repetitive, it's set up on a series of memory blocks, which are self contained stories which combine together to form the story arc.  In the game or the Animus you are greeted with 6 or 7 different investigations, 3 of which are required to access the unique Assassination.  These are generic Eavesdropping, pick pocketing, Interrogations (nearly identical to pick pocketing, only this one requires you to beat up the target for information).  The few others scattered in are timed flag captures, assassinations, and destruction mission..   This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't repeated on every stage, about 3 times per map. You also have two types of collectibles, each of the 5 major areas has it's own set of collectibles.  Flags, view points and citizens... the flags offer little to no reason to actually collect them, I suppose on the console versions collecting all of them would net you an achievement or trophy, but the PC version offers nothing.  I guess this was just left over from the console version..  Competitionist will probably enjoy tracking down these little boogers, but the rest of us will just ignore them as you gain nothing from collecting them.  The view points are far more valuable as each one removes fog off the in game map, and reveals the locations of investigations, and citizens which you can rescue from harassment.  The Citizens unlike the flags actually have the added benefit of placing either a roving band of Scholars which allow you to easily escape from guards or citizens who grab and stop guards from chasing you.THE COMBAT, The combat appears to be a button masher at first, but you'll quickly discover the true way to be a master assassin is using Counter Attack, which often times turns combat into a long drawn out affair.  Instead of mashing down the buttons and quickly ending the guards, you're left to wait for an attack.. It can take the Guards anywhere from 5 - 15 seconds to attack.  Early on in the game you're assassin seems much more capable of killing guards, normally a counter attack means the guard dies.  Later on the guards can take three or four counters to actually die.  Many encounters have the potential of having 10+ guards.  So do the math... the game is called ""Assassin"" Creed though, so you'll figure out that it's much easier to run away and hide than try and fight them all..THE GRADE, in 2008 when the game was first released, I'd give it an easy 9/10, it was revolutionary for it's time, and presented a unique experience which was fairly lacking at the time.  In 2016 the game feels very dated.  Considering video games aren't wine being dated isn't a good thing.  So I'd say it's probably a 6/10.  Not a great game but certainly not a bad game either, far greater choices exist in 2016 which were absent in 2008.I'll recommend this game as it's the game which started the Assassin Creed franchise, and most people like myself just can't hop into a series in the middle.  So be Leary if you buy the game you may very well find yourself going gah, I have to do this again?  Just suck it up and plow through, the second game is only 15 - 17 hours away...			"

												The first entry in an annual franchise from Ubisoft and the most unique. Unlike the sequels this game is far from the open world collectathon that the Assassin's Creed series has become. The majority of the game is fairly linear and consists entirely of assasssinating specific characters. Completing the assassinations progresses the plot and unlocks new abilities for you, this game is far more similar to something like Hitman than what the modern Assassin's Creed games are. Unfortunately there are plenty of faults in this one too. The side activities are almost non existent and by adding fast travel between cities eliminates the majority of the open world exploration in this game. This game is also very guilty of not explaining a lot of the mechanics to the player and providing very poor tutorials. However I still think it's a very unique and interesting game despite all of it's flaws. One of the things I really enjoy about it is the fact that you can play through the entire game with all of the on screen HUD disabled only relying on ingrame visual and audio queues.Definitely worth the going price now.

												First game in the Assassin's Creed series and well worth playing even if you've already played the later ones. You need to assassinate certain targets. First, you need to gather information about your surroundings. Then, you need to gather information about your assassination target. Once you have gathered enough information, you can go and assassinate your target (how you do that is up to you and the information you gathered).You can also explore the wonderful big cities and interact with many guards and civilians.

												The first Assassin's Creed was the most promising game in development, and shined brightly from every games exhibition. When it was released, though, the hyped expectations of the whole gaming world were... turned down, sadly.While without a doubt that was a high-class, AAA product, with prodigious depth of open-world gaming experience, fascinating visuals, thoroughly reconstructed medieval cities and intriguing story. Yet all that was not enough. The creators of Assassin's Creed made almost everything right... but lose the fun-out-of-the-gameplay somewhere on producing stages.I remember playing the game right after release, and I was grown tired of it in second city, no matter how much I was stunned by the prologue and the first city. Inglorious Re-Peeat-Ability is the thing that killed the hype of the game and downgraded its undoubted merits. The most usual Ubisoft story, as it seems.But, as we look now, after the dust is settled, the first Assassin game was not bad. Quite contrary, it is still pleases us with visual feast. The reconstruction of medieval world is one of the best in known fiction worlds, would that be games, books or films. The fighting theme is ten times bested by the Shadow of Mordor title... but it is still engaging. Stealth is no match in terms of cunning and diversity with games like Hitman... But you know that too, you get used to it so long ago!So, that that's I'm gonna tell you: if you've missed that game so far, try it now, it is definetely worth a shot. Just... don't play it like an open-world game. I can't believe I write something like that, being a huge fan on open-world gameplay, but in case of AC1 that's the point. There are just not enough rewards for the whole additional activity Ubisoft added in the game. No point in opening chests, collecting flags, and so on. That's that killed my fun when I was making my first approach there.Just play the scenario missions and kill occasional tampliers on your way, while exploring and sightseeing the great cities which was putted into that game. As I said already, there are no other thing, which will give you so complex experience of life in the medieval Mid-East. Just for that Assassin's Creed 1 deserves a place in your games collection, aside from a fact it was a father for superb Assassin's Creed 2, which stands proudly as one of the best games ever created.My mark 7.5. Not a diamond, but still glimmering and even shines, if you know, how to look at it.			"

												An absolutely fantastic, one of a kind, unique game... if you play it with HUD turned off. I explain it in detail here: https://stanislavcostiuc.com/2016/03/02/hud-less-design-of-assassins-creed-1/But the short gist of it, AC1 was clearly designed to be played without a HUD (except some of the missions that were added in the PC version, they didn't take HUD-less design into account), and it provides a whole different experience. As an example, you're not going to an eavesdrop icon to listen to a minute of conversation and that's it, mission done. You're going to the Jewish Quarter because that's where the Rafiq told you there might be information, and you find the Jewish Quarter by seeing in the distance the Star of David on a gateway, while you're on the rooftop, and then you explore and use your Eagle Vision to see who knows something.As soon as the HUD is introduced, a lot of this is lost, and the cyclic nature of the game is seen (which is why a lot of people call the game repetitive, because HUD makes the cyclic nature obvious, but without it you NEED it to learn patterns and to investigate what's out of the pattern).Even if you've played and like the game already, but have never played it with HUD fully off... do it. It won't be a perfect HUD-less experience on PC (mainly because, as I mentioned, new PC missions don't take HUD-less design into account, but you can ignore those because not every mission is required for game completion), but it will still be great and unique.

PROS:+ interesting story+ cool mix between historical settings and Animus UI+ huge map (after unlocking the areas)+ horse riding+ assassination missions+ smooth combat with impressive combos+ no uPlayCONS:- falling into water kills you- after a while the guard fighting gets repetitive- progress save system- graphical glitches- bad video card optimization- audio can go out of sync in rare occassionsComment:A somewhat crude and at times clunky introduction to the series. But I really liked it. Why? Well the story is okay, but the assassinations, THOSE take the cake. Not all are equally good but all felt satisfying. The combat is fun as well although having to battle guards over and over can get repetitive after a while. The later ugrades that Altair gets make the combat even better. Falling into water kills you in this game which is rather immersion breaking (why would a trained assassin not be able to swim?) but not game breaking. The horse riding is cool although sometimes the horses handle poorly. Many people do not like the Desmond timeline but I do, it adds flavour to the story. Overall a cool game that has some bugs and boring/annoying parts which get mostly negated by the smooth combat and assassination system. Recommended!			"

""You're a young arrogant assassin who got himself into a whole lot of troubles after a mission gone outrageously wrong..."" - that would make a pretty good start for any sort of story, and Assassin's Creed is no exception.(Rightfully) blamed for the death of one assassin and crippling of another, Altaïr is given one last chance to redeem himself.On his quest to find inner peace (and assassinate a bunch of Templars along the way), he learns the rather unsettling meaning behind the Assassins' motto that ""nothing is true and everything is permitted"".If, for whatever reason, you never gave this awesome game a try, you should do so. Right now. Because if you don't, you'll be missing quite a lot ;)			"

												This remains the only Assassin's Creed game that I ever enjoyed, also the only ""Almost"" historically correct one too.When the assassin ancestors turns into arrogant italians, and other random nationalities in the new games, instead of the cold blooded silent killer Altaïr from the Middle east, I simply vomit.The Franchise became so popular, that it ruined the continued series. This Assassin's creed though, is not any of that. It remains a pearl in the evolution of games in everyway.			"

Posted: March 19
												Author's Note: I've been a fan of Assassin's Creed for around 4 years and I recently decided to replay the entire series so, here goes my review for the very first game. The one that started it all. Back before naval combat, Ezio, hook blades, and yes, even before two hidden blades came Assassin's Creed (1). Assassin's Creed follows the story of Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad as he seeks to regain his assassin rank. Like the future games, this one takes place in a historic setting, this one's Jerusalem during the Crusades. Before I dive into the setting and scenery, let's first talk gameplay mechanics. So, the game gradually gives you back your original weapons, as well as skills. The weapons include a sword, dagger, throwing knifes, and of course the hidden blade. The combat is pretty good in the first one, but it's definitely improved through the years. You can block attacks, counter, and dodge. Now, if you're used to the newer games, you'll find the hidden blade a little different than what you're used to. The hidden blade can't really be used in a fight, it's only really for sneaking up on enemies. The sword combat is fairly good, but like I've stated before, they've improved throughout the series. One thing that may disappoint you is the lack of the crossbow that you see in the trailer. Sadly, the crossbow was cut out due to the fact that it made assassinations easier, but you'll do fine without it. Now, you've got all of you weapons so, you need something to use them on. As you go through the game, you are tasked with gathering information and killing targets chosen by the master of the Assassins. This is done in different ways, and in different locations. First, you'll have to go up to a viewpoint and sync in order to see your choices. Usually, you have to complete three of these tasks to gather enough information for the kill. This information can actually be pretty useful and makes killing your target easier. These tasks kind of feel like mini-games and they're pretty fun! There's pickpocketing, gathering flags, and even killing targets. There's more than that, but I'll let you explore the other options. Okay, so you've got all of the intel, now it's time for the kill! Your targets vary from either sneaking into their base of operations and (trying to) stealthily kill them or dueling them. If you fail at stealth, then you'll probably either have to duel them or chase after them (Just depends on how much they value their lives). This is pretty fun and never really gets boring. In reality, the game is a little repetitive, but to be honest, it never really felt that way for me. Just enjoy the moment. Alright, so we've talked about assassinating big targets, now let's talk about their little henchmen. As you go through the game, you'll fight a variety of enemies, such as: guys with swords, heavy armor guys, guys with bows, guys with maces, and so on. The combat really isn't that hard and it doesn't take much to get used to it. The enemy A.I is fairly good, but sometimes a little laughable. They do sometimes pose a challenge though, which is always fun. Oh, and just like you, they can't swim! Looks like you're not that different from them deep down. So far, we've covered killing, killing, and...ah...well, more killing! Now on to the scenery. So, the game takes place during the times of the Crusades (hench all of the Templars) in the area, and even in, Jerusalem. The cities you'll visit are fairly large and full of life. You'll usually see at least 4 people, usually a fair bit more, in most areas on the streets. The cities look great for its time and the game runs rather smoothly. How do you get to the cities though? Well, you'll eventually unlock the fast traveling system, which means you'll travel...fast. It's not too different from the one you'll find in AC 2, but you won't need a boat. As soon as you run out of the Assassin HQ, you'll get the option to fast travel. If you'd rather see the world for yourself, you can always travel by horse. Now, on to the last bit of stuff. So, the voice acting's pretty darn good, even if Altair has an American accent for some reason...you get used to it though. The graphics, like I said, are pretty great. Even the soundtrack is pretty great, it provides even more tension to tense situations! Overall, this is a really great game! If you haven't played any of the Assassin's Creed games before, this is a great starting point. You'll really appreciate the newer mechanics in the later games. If you've already played some AC games and not this one, this is a great chance to see what you missed! It may not be the best Assassin's Creed game ever *cough* *cough* Assassin's Creed 2 *cough* but it's definitely a great start to an amazing franchise.			"

												Great game back in its time. Still a great game by today's standards. The gameplay is smooth and (usually) intuitive. You might notice that the game's primary SKU is for a console by the menu style. It's a little off-putting,  but once you actually get into the game, you forget about it and focus on the story or the missions. If you're using a gamepad, you probably won't notice. The voice acting is superb and the views and vistas are breathtaking. The environments are wonderfully immersive and keep you interested in the story.This game is worth its current price of $20. If you haven't played it, you're missing out.			"

												This assassin's creed is the classic. It might not be the best. Graphics look pretty much outdated, controls are a bit clunky (as they got redesigned in the newer games). Story wise is fairly short and not very eventful. It almost feels like a prequel of the Desmond's story (first 5 AC games till ACIII). Though, it has that unique feel how this title really should be. You play as a ""real asssassin"" not a pirate, not a thief, not a mobster. You're just pure ancient assassin in this game. Obey the sacred creed (it's Hashashin assassins vs Crusader templars in 1191), recieve order from your master, ride a horse the another city your target's located (no fast travel at all), go to assassin hidout and get more information/plan, eliminate the target, escape and go back to the headquater the inform the result.

												So this is where it all began, the first AC...Please keep in mind that this game now is almost 10 years old, and it is showing it's age. So if you have played more recent ACs and want to check out the very first one, be prepared for some major differences. However, the game still looks nice... it's colorful, the animations still look cool and it's still fun to run around in Damasc, Accra and Jerusalem. Some differences though:- The parcouring/freerunning works quite well, but it's pretty...clunky compared to that in, say, Unity or Syndicate. So accidents will happen, you will experience some misjumps and will prolly fall a couple of times. Still, it can be quite fun.- The combat system is a bit spammy. Mostly, you hit x to strike and, while holding the block-button (shoulder button on a controller), hit x as well to block and counter-strike.At first, combat is rough, but with each sequence, you learn more abilities (or get them back), so you can fight more efficiently, and a counter-strike will often result in one-shotting a mob.- You have your sword, throwing knifes (which you can fight with), your fists and the hidden blade (which you can't fight with really, it's only used for stabbing people who are unaware), that's it... no smoke bombs, rope darts, guns, bows, xbows etc. It's limited, but that does not bother me much.- The cinematics/conversations are rather long, and can not be skipped. However, if you play this for the very first time, that's ok, as it's interesting to listen and learn about the story and background. - There are some bugs and glitches... occasionally, you'll die when you hit a haystack, which of course is a bug. - The sequences are a bit repetitive... climb towers to find activities, do those to gather information on your target, report to your fellow assassin at the bureau, then head for the assassination of the target. It's like that until the end of the game.- There is some side activity, but not as much as in recent games. No money, no purchasing of gear upgrades etc.The game is showing it's age, and of course, AC II later hit the ball out of the park, BUT:I still think that, if you like the franchise, you should play this first one at least once to see the start of the series. It's not all that long, and I think it's still a fun game with a lot of atmosphere and a wonderful soundtrack by Jesper Kyd. And to be frank, I enjoyed replaying this much more than the most recent, IMO horrible Syndicate, and even the very spammy combat in AC I is better than the one in that new game. So... check it out. It's old, has quite a few flaws and is missing a lot of the things more modern ACs had, but it's a great start to the series. I REALLY REALLY recommend to use a controller though! I played all of them with a controller, but especially for this one, I don't think you'll get much out of it if you try to play it with kbm. 7.5/10			"

Assassin's Creed: Director's Cut EditionIt's hard to deny: Assassin's Creed was a game changer. I was obsessed with this game when it came out, and having just replayed it recently, I can say that it's withstood the test of time rather well. For those of you that prefer the controller to the keyboard, this solution was a big help for me.Pros:Simple but effective, history-based storyline (with classic cliffhanger);Non-negligible freedom in tackling each assassination thanks to original gameplay mechanics;Locking main quests pending side quest progression is a good way to contextualise the latter;Original locales rendered in surprising detail;Escaping foes by breaking the line of sight is easily one of the most thrilling aspects of the game;Fast-travel is a welcome option to be able to focus on the storyline;DC adds additional side quests for a bit of variation; The graphics hold up rather well for a 2007 game, with the various settings expected on PC.Cons:The Kingdom is impressively vast but ultimately feels redundant;Investigation has little impact on how you actually tackle any given target;Uninspired collectibles.

												I ""sort of"" recommend this game. There should really be a neutral buttom, because 2017, this game is a bit ""meh"".See, when I first played assassin's creed, way back when it was first released, I was blown away by how beautiful the game was, and how awesome it was to be able to freerun. My entire first playthrough was just me being mesmerized by how awesome it was to be able to move more or less how you want to. But as I went to replay this game a second time, a year after my first playthrough, it was a lot less appealing. Now, many years later, I replay this game here on steam, and I can look at the game with a fresh set of eyes.Playing assassin's game the first time is sort of like having a summer fling on a festival or concert when you're in your early teens. You're blown away by how good they look, and how much in common you have, and how awesome and open they are. But they're really only good for that summer fling, beause the whole infatuation is shallow and lacks content. That's what assassin's creed is to me. It still looks good after all these years... But behind the polished surface, there isn't a whole lot to be attracted yo. There's tons of bugs in spite of all time that has gone by, and the controls is clunky and unwieldy. You are still asked at time to do things which will be hard not because it's hard, but because you can't really make the controls do what you want them to. Did you enter a ladder at a weirld camera angle? Now W on your keyboard doesn't make the main character go up, but instead down. Did you run too close to a bench while being pursued by guards? Now your character will sit on it instead of keep running. Did you enter combat? Now your character will draw his sword, even if you would prefer another weapon and had a different weapon drawn.These are just loose examples. Assassin's Creed is packed with these issues. Sometimes, carrying out certain missions is not a delight, but a chore, because you are aware that while you can come up with a good plan for how to perform the mission, the most likely reason you will fail it, is because of a bug. Not because of game difficulty or something similar, but because there are still issues with the game and when the game is sporting an ancient save system, it means replaying large contents of the game over and over.Well on to other things.The main character is both believeable and unfortunatley a bit boring. As an assassin, taking lives every other day, you can imagine that someone must become hard on the inside to cope with the problems. It takes a certain type of person to do those things, and even if you're not bent on murder in particular, that sort of life will likely bend your mind to a single purpose - the cause. So Altair is not a deep person, he doesn't seem to have a background which would be interesting to explore, and he doesn't have any meaningful personal relationships either. He sort of just... Goes through life, assassinating people, because that's who he is. And that's great. It's believable to me. But it's also boring. I never felt that I got to know Altair, I don't really know who he is outside of his knife stabbing personna. And that is a bit of a shame. Ubisoft does a better job with later iterations of assassin's creed and its characters.The story is forgettable. There's a story twist, but you can spot it coming long long before it's ""revealed"" to the character. There's not a whole lot of side missions beside the main story, and for being a free roam game... There's not much to roam in. I mean, the maps are huge but... There's just you, the main story and some side missions to help you succeed with the main story, and ten million billion collectibles. Alright, not that many. But still, Ubisoft sure tried to fluff replayability of the game by having a lot of flags one can collect.In either case, since the game is now pretty cheap, I do recommend it. But I advise seeing it as a prequel to the story about Ezio Auditore, which is the protagonist in the next three games (assassin's creed 2, assassin's creed: brotherhood, and assassin's creed: revelations), rather than a game of its own.

The game still has a fascinating and well thought out story with good replayable gameplay. This game also has awesome graphics and cool cutscenes.

 Introduction Assassin's Creed, takes place during the Third Crusade.You play as Altaïr ibn-La'Ahad, the Assassin who breaks all three tenets of the Brotherhood.Altaïr then gets demoted to Novice being tasked with assassinating the nine Knights Templars to regain his former status.First of it's series, Assassin's Creed bring you a new type of genre for the gaming industry. Categories GameplayCombatStoryGraphicsOptimizationBugsPersonal ExperienceProsConsConclusion Gameplay Assassin's Creed revolves around combat, parkour and, stealth.You must run/ride long distances to get to your destination, you cannot swim.The parkour seems to be restricted, though being the first Assassin's Creed game: it's to be expected. Combat The combat in this edition of Assassin's Creed is quite annoying.You could be walking around somewhere, and out of nowhere an civilian starts punching you. Nothing you do will get rid of the civilian without running away, thus having a guard notice you and have a bunch come after you. Guards will also notice you, if the civilian hits you.General combat is decently fluent.You get into a fight with a bunch of guards and counter-attacking seemed best.When you try to block guards and, they are behind you, sometimes it won't let you block them which gets very annoying.Combat is basically just pretty basic, nothing special.StoryUnfortunately, the story was not interesting, and I found myself rushing to complete it.You go back and forth from the ""Assassin's Den"" and whichever city you are in to assassinate a target.When you get sent after a target, it gets confusing on what to do, and where to go.The dialog in the game is rather boring, and has no real point to focus on it.Towards the end of the game, it gets interesting. Graphics Considering the game is from 2007, the graphics aren't overwhelming.For my playthrough, I downloaded a graphics mod and played in DSR 4k 60fps.The game looked margionally better like this. Optimization The optimization in this game is poor.Frame rate stutters from 60 to 59 occasionally.Crashes at random points, and minimizing will resort in odd coloring. Bugs Enemies will attack you even when you block them.Assassinating someone with your knife, doesn't always work correctly. Personal Experience Rather boring experience, found myself rushing until the end.Smooth gameplay experiences with some crashes.Decent game for it's time. Pros Decent game.Has parkour.It's Assassin's Creed. Cons Boring.Micro-stutters.Crashes.Repetitive.Slow paced. Conclusion It's a pretty solid game, and it was a great way to start off the series.The Assassin's Creed games built up greatly from this one with large improvements.Get it, and be able to try out the first of the franchise.

This is the game that got me to buy several series of the game that I have yet to finish because of the sheer tasks and objectives that I want to get and accomplish.  But like I said, this game started it all.  The first installment of an amazing game series.  All of the AC games, nothing beats the original and no Uplay by Ubisoft before you start the game.			"

												As an AC-fan you should definitely get the initial game, even though the graphics are worse than in the recent games.Why would that be a problem, if you can run around in a huge, oriental Open World and♥♥♥♥♥♥Templars?There is alot to be done and a lot of fun to be had with this game.The only thing I can fault this game for, is the Stealth system.. Either every guard and soldier is equipped with eyes on their back and a sense of hearing similar to that of a lynx, or I straightout am the worst player ever.Well and the usual cons of every game in the series: except for fakn Unity  yey ^-^- You are a Master Assassin but unable to sneak. The only way to stealth really is to pretend not be    an assassin.- And you are a Master Assassin, with perfect gear and had years of schooling. Still every single guard or soldier, no matter how minor their training was and how crappy their skills should be,is able to climb buildings and leap about on rooftops, just as agile as you, regardless how heavy their armor is. I know it would probably make the game too easy if they could not do that, but it would make more sense.Still I love the whole franchise and the first game is definitely worth mentioning.(I am also having some troubles with the Fullscreen-mode, but that is probably because of my own incompetence.)9/10			"

												The first game in the Assassin's Creed series is the game you should either start the series with, or go into with lower expectations. That's not to say this game is bad, it's just one that has sequals which far exceed the original.Advertising itself as a ""next-gen"" (beginning of Xbox 360/PS3 era) game, in retrospect this game definitely looks (emphasis on the ""looks"") that way. Set in the 12th century during the Third Crusade, AC1 tells the tale of an underground battle between two opposing factions that has gone on since the begginnings of our species, and you play as Altair, a member of the Assassin Order. The plot is not the most exciting part of the game, but the ideas about human nature were enough to keep me interested into it to a certain extent. The characters are forgetable, besides our protagonist. Altair is a rather brash Assassin who fails a mission in the opening act of the game, and this game details his journey to get back to his previous rank within the Assassin Order. Besides the out of place American accent (ugh), Altair is a rather badass and interesting protagonist who keeps the plot afloat.On the other hand, the world which the game is sent in is rich and engrossing. The graphical quality greatly reflects the world of the Crusade, and cities are full of NPC's which go about on their day. The sheer size of the maps will surely impress if this is your first AC game. Immersion is also something this game nails on the head, despite its numerous flaws. The soundtrack may not be entirely memorable, but it nonetheless fits the game extremly well. Voice work (minus Altair) is definitely of a high quality and fits in as well. However, do not look to this game as a history lesson that is 1:1 with reality. This game does take history and makes it fit into a video game, and isn't entirely accurate (which the game acknowledges). This goes into a part of the game that is really up to opinion when it comes to the story: You're actually reliving the memories Altair, who is the ancestor of our true protagonist Desmond. Here you meet Lucy and Videc, one of which is a rather bland assistant character, while the other is an evil scientist. While these characters came across as rather boring to me, Desmond's character really makes them seem like works out of Shakespear. Desmond is an EXTREMLY bland character, and one that I honestly didn't care about. The game pulls your out of the Animus (the device used to relive memories) after every chapter, and these segmants are real pacebrakers, despite some interesting conversations between Desmond and Videc here and there. Another issue I have withe the games story is how abrupt the ending is, and a plotpoint that comes up near the end of the game without explanation and just feels like it's there to break immersion and be picked up later on. While I wont go into details, the game definitely makes it feel as if it NEEDS to have a sequal, whether you as the player likes it or not.While it may seem as if I hate this game, I must say I actually did have an enjoyable experience with the gameplay. Sure, the game is repititive with the same objective structure being true for 85% or so of the game: Complete 3 missions, and assassinite your target. While this may definitely be a problem for some, the gameplay does work quite well to break this problem apart.A staple of Assassins Creed is its parkour and stealth mechanics, and both are present and enjoyable to do here. Soaring across the games three cities is enjoyable, and stealth can be very rewarding in the game as it is quite difficult to pull off compared to the sequals. Combat is also very rich, and has many sides to it (even though it becomes pathetically easy with counters). You can dodge, block, grab, and slash at your opponents with various tools at your disposal: a sword, a shortsword, throwing knives, and the iconic hidden blade (and also your fists, of course). The objectives your are required to complete before assassinations are quite repepitive however, and may be something you may not enjoy. I personally found informer challaneges to be very tricky, while pickpockets and interrogations were far too easy. And eavesdropping is... well... sitting on a bench, and that's that. Assassinations are, however, very enjoyable and can be done in a variety of manners, and are followed by extremly intense escpae sequences that will keep you on your toes.While there are some optional activities (saving civilians, collect-a-thons, and scaling every viewpoint), the game doesn't offer too much else. and is purely an action adventure game rather than an RPG (like its sequals). This is why Assassin's Creed is honestly a game that doesn't have too much replay value, even though the adventure is about 15 hours and is overall enjoyable, if not repitive for 85% of the journey and telling of a story that isn't too memorbale, despite the immersive world presented. $20 may be a bit too much for how shallow AC1 is (and considering you can buy the more polished sequals for the same price), and if you're curious I would advice that you wait for this to go on sale and to have an open mind. However, the game should keep you entertained enough to be interested in AC2, which is definitely a GOOD thing.Overall, AC1 is a decent first game into the AC franchise, and one you should approach with some caution, and avoid if you've played the other AC games (unless you're extremly curious). I would give this game an overall 7/10, however if I had to take replayability into account it's definitely a 6/10.			"

												First Assassin's Creed game I played and... I'm glad I did. I read the book first so I knew the story before playing it, damn. I love Altair. (ihugege <3)I won't talk about the story, you can read the game description. Graphics: Good I'd say for a game that already has 7 years if I'm not mistaken, I loved the animations during the synchronizations, well done. You can judge it yourself with playthroughs or trailers if you don't want any spoil.OST: Didn't enjoy all of them, but it probably just suits the game as it should, the best one for me was Acre, the others are still good tho. Gameplay: Ruuuunnn, climmmmbb, juuuuummp, that part was so much fun. Sometimes I was just wandering from place to place without any reasons because I enjoyed doing so. As for combat, you have 4 differents weapons depending on how you like to play. I loved sneaking in and using the hidden blade. You also get to learn new techniques (like counter hehe) so it helps you to fight faster and easier.Overall: I loved it (and that end !!!) Altair is the best assassin for sure, he evolves so much through the game.This is my opinion, now play and GET YOUR OWN, you probably won't regret it anyway.			"

												Assassin's Creed™: Director's Cut Edition is an action adventure game set in The Holy Land during The Third Crusade 1191 AD.You're Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, a skilled, but very arrogant assassin. Because of this, you failed your most important mission, and soon, your glory, turned into blame. Now, to redeem yourself, you must kill who your master, Al Mualim, tells you to, and with that, finally bring peace to the Holy Land. But,  Why these men? What were their intentions? What is their sin? What if you're wrong?It's repetitive, frustrating, it can't stand to its successors, but, it's still playable, and a must play for any fan of the series.★★★★☆ | Liked it "

												My blade sees for me… It cuts through the darkness.This is how it all began, the journey of Desmond Miles and his Assassin-ancestors. You play as Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, the assassin who founded the Order of the assassins. As Altaïr, you have to uncover the secrets of the creed and the mysterious apple of eden, while fighting against your enemies, the templar! It is a good game on it's own, but definatly not as good as it's sequels, since you can't even air-assassinate people here. This game clearly isn't made for a Pc Keyboard, but for consoles, so I suggest you get a Gamepad to play with before you play this game with the frustrating controls of the Pc version.5/10			"

Posted: November 9, 2015
												Assassin's Creed is a very strong game that will satisfy individiuals that love history and war, but also the real main story of Assassins Creed.Setting: The game is set in the Third Crusade times, the battle between Islam and Christianity. It features Desmond Miles, a protagonist in 21st Century America, which is kidnapped by the antagonist company Abstergo Industries. This company uses the Animus, a generic-memory stimulator, on Desmond to recall his memories through his ancestor Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad. The cities involved are Masyaf, the assassin creed's home city, Acre, ran by the Knights Templars, and Jerusalem and Damascus, both cities ran by the Templars and enemy Saracens. There is one more city however I won't spoil it. The landscape is different for each city, but only noticable in each city. There are three districts, poor, middle, and rich district, and you would assume there are higher quality buildings as the districts become richer, but again, you can only notice them.Plot: The plot line is certainly intriguing. Having played AC II, Brotherhood, and Revelations, and having not finished AC I, all the storylines from the sequels made actual sense once I completed this. Onto the plot though, there are two separate plots that do intertwine. To clarify that, there is the story of Desmond and the story of Altair and the plotlines intertwine through the story of Altair and Desmond mashing in present 21st century America (hard to explain I know). Just know, the plot makes absolute sense once you play the games. From the perspective of AC's release in 2007, it was very very intriguing to interpret the plot without knowing the sequel storylines, so the plot from that perspective is a massive plus. The finish was very surprising as well might I mention.Also, I completed the game in 18 hours, which included the core plot and the main side-missions. I did not complete finding the flags and killing the templar guards as I found them to be irrelevent. I had only played 14.9 hours on Steam, however 18 hours came from I playing about 3.5 hours of the game and me realising after three hours that Steam didn't realise I was playing AC, so there was a glitch in the Steam Client.Only nuisences regarding the plot is the side-missions. As you progress into the game, they become more of a chore than actual for fun, for example, when there is an investigation side mission, the guards keep on coming later in the game and is ridiculous as they are alert, and spot you without even looking at you, meaning you failed the investigation. So yes, there was a few unbalanced AI involved with the missions, but other than that, it relieves you in the end once you know all are completed.And to note, I realised why I got so bored of the game about three hours into it on my first playthrough last year, and that was because the horse riding from Masyaf to the other cities is so long, it would take at least 15 minutes to travel, ridiculous and boring especially when 'The Kingdom' is just a transition area with no real meaning.Gameplay: Gameplay is very solid. For a game released in 2007, it is surprising to see how smooth the gameplay is. For a game that emphasises parkour and combat, I see it as a major positive adding to the game. Only negatives regarding gameplay is how basic some actions are. For example, you will notice the same amount of counters to attacks and blocks, something that I felt could have been explored further.Sound/Dialogue/Graphics: The graphics are very good for a 2007 game. I praise that. Dialogue is good as there is mostly variety in individual dialogues. Only negative for dialogue is the 'Save Citizens' missions, the dialogue is extremely repeatitive. There was also some minor speech issues that I had noticed. Sound: Serviceable. There was rare audio issues that I encountered.Negatives: This review may seem very positive, but gee these negatives are really that annoying. Overall, there are several bugs and glitches I'll name a few, for 'Save Citizens' missions, you would get glitches where you could not trigger the person to speak to after completing the task. Another was camera's getting stuck on the player, especially moderately when walking through doors, completely annoying. Overall: A very solid game and a good first-entry to the Assassins Creed series. If you didn't bother reading the review, the plot was consistent and intriguing, the graphics were very good, the sound was servicable, the dialogue was good, and gameplay was very solid. There were several bugs and glitches within the game that completely nagged me. The game is currently worth $10 on Steam, I'd say buy it, no harm done, sets up the good foundation for the series. Now, the rating is low compared to what I mentioned in the review as it was not an excellent game by all means. 7.5/10EDIT: I didn't note, but since the game took me 18 hours to complete, for the individual, I would assume it would take 20+ hours to complete by doing all tasks.----Thanks for reading my review!

Introduction: Initially published by Ubisoft in 2007, Assassin’s Creed is the under-appreciated foundation of the critically acclaimed franchise. It is an atmospheric historical fiction action-adventure sandbox. While this fluid and beautiful game is often the victim of mixed reviews by fans, it serves a very important purpose. The first time I tried this game, I put it down as a result of becoming bored too quickly, but this game is worth investing in. That is, if you have taken a shine to any of its sequels. It is my strong and undying opinion that you’d be doing the developers a great disservice by skipping the heart of the best selling series. While the later games are more entertaining and hold more appeal, one needs to play Assassin’s Creed in order to truly understand the elaborate groundwork laid out for its successors. Story: The game focuses on the use of an immersive computer system known as the “Animus”, and its latest subject called Desmond Miles. While Desmond may appear to be an average bartender from an average world, he is actually a descendant of the legendary Assassin Altaïr Ibn-La’Ahad. Through the Animus, the player will bear witness to the genetic memories of Desmond’s ancestor, and the events between two secret societies as they unfold during the Third Crusade. Overall, I felt that the story was weak, but it took some revolutionary steps towards creating a solid foundation for a marvelous series of sequels. While the story might initially seem confusing as the player nears the end, it is surprisingly well thought out, so give it a chance.Gameplay: As stated previously, much of the game is disclosed through the eyes of Desmond Miles as he relives the memories of Altaïr through the Animus. Inside the Animus, the player will be introduced to a computerized interface displaying all of the mandatory information varying from health to inventory, and a third person view of Altaïr.It is important for anyone unfamiliar with the franchise to be aware that Altaïr moves in real time opposed to turn-based. The  movement in the game is possibly its most notable feature which permits the player to scale buildings, catch ledges, jump over gaps, and more. Assassin’s Creed has a love for utilizing a diverse set of active (high profile) and passive (low profile) approaches, so if you manage to draw unwanted attention to yourself, you’re probably going to need to find a haystack - fast - unless you feel like fighting a band of poor unfortunate souls (otherwise known as guards).Unfortunately, even with easy access to multiple weapon sets and various combat skills, the gameplay of Assassin’s Creed can only be described as repetitive. The game makes a habit of recycling the same formula for most of the key assassinations, which becomes tedious. Despite that, it’s still worth buying - If this is too repetitive, simply rush through this game. There is a lot more to do in its successors, and the developers improve the ability to enjoy the tasks in the future. However, as I stated, skipping the groundwork does the entire franchise a bit of a disservice.Furthermore, as Altaïr the player will also need to familiarize themselves with the art of synchronization. Synchronization is measured by the Animus as Desmond follows his genetic memories, and reflects its user’s faithfulness to the memory in question. In other words, is Desmond re-living the memory as it was, or has he diverted from its path? Straying too far from the objective will result in a loss of synchronization, which will result in forcing the user to start over from an earlier point. Needless to say, not “everything is permitted”. Finally, the last aspect that I really feel called to touch on is Eagle Vision. In short, Eagle Vision is a seemingly dormant sixth sense in most humans, however it manages to aid Altaïr in his tasks throughout the game. Utilized, this ability will help the player to locate targets, gauge intentions of others, and ultimately seek out his mark. I found this aspect to be fairly interesting, and hope you enjoy using this ability as much as I did.Controls: The controls of Assassin’s Creed are extremely friendly. I used my 360 controller, and the game provided me with excellent controller support. However, I did try to play the game with the mouse and keyboard setup, and I cannot recommend this to anyone. This game is best played with a controller. In general, the targeting is a bit tricky, but that is something you can work around.Graphics: As I stated at the beginning of the review, I tried playing Assassin’s Creed once before. What I failed to mention was that my first attempt was on the XBOX 360 years ago. On the 360, the game looked polished and pretty. However, it’s original appeal has nothing on the dreamlike quality of the graphics on the PC. I could hardly believe that the game was originally released in 2007 when I first booted it up. Sure, there are some technical glitches here and there, but the PC version has definitely left a deeper impression.I feel like it is an understatement to report that the views in Assassin’s Creed are breathtaking. In fact, they are polished, atmospheric, realistic, and lifelike. It is absolutely fascinating to me how well Ubisoft managed to present the world in this game. Sound: In Assassin’s Creed, you will come to hate that one stupid beggar that manages to find you in every single town, who just absolutely has to tell you “My family is sick and dying”... What I’m really trying to say, is that the continuously recycled voice tracks are just as repetitive as the gameplay itself. If it doesn’t annoy you, I envy you your patience. With a bit more polishing (and perhaps a few more lines recorded by their voice actors) the NPCs could have been a much enjoyable thing to encounter.On a positive note, the music is gorgeous. Overall the sounds of Assassin’s Creed are realistic and immersive, fitting for a game that places a heavy focus on its atmosphere.Replay Value: I’m not sure I’d play it again, unless I wanted a refresher of the story, but it is definitely worth at least one playthrough. As always, the replay value is entirely dependent on the individual holding the controller, and I can see a great deal of replay potential in this game. While the story is questionably weak, there are a lot of remaining individual elements to explore and to enjoy - Particularly if you enjoy exploration and immersive combat.			"

												Personal Rating: 5.5 of 10One of the most solid and stable Assassin's Creed game (up till III) in terms of performance. Its really cool to be jumping around roof tops doing parkour and killing people with awesome animation. It is also very unique and smart on how the game incorporates modern technologies into a game set in the medieval time.Although the settings are really nice, the game don't really feel immensive. Example, rooftops and buildings are repetitive so you actually stop paying attention to them and refer to the minimap to get to your location. Combat is okay as they try to design it to be realistic as possible when taking several enemies at the same time but can be slow. The NPCs are there to make the city feels alive but that is it. They are like zombies wandering around.Missions are repetitive. I actually reinstalled this game three times before progressing half-way or so because every mission does not have much room for exploitation for an assassin game. Even if your presence is made known before killing your target, it simply means you are going to have a tougher time getting away and each mission feels more like a puzzle than an assasination mission. Also, based on my understanding, assassination are suppose to be done discreetly and probably when there are less people as possible like night time maybe?Again, side missions are simply there for the sake of existing. Meaning once the game is completed, side missions are fitted in to the game with minimal effort like collectibles, races, deliveries and etcs. The rewards are not that great to start with nor even the stories that comes with the side missions.Weapons and skills are unlocked progressively but it is not that great. I can't even make out the difference between a sword and wrist blade except that killing people with the blade is really stylish and cool.Cities are huge but you need to make several travels between them as the areas are unlocked progressively so yeah visiting the same place over and over again is kind of boring too.Story is quite interesting however do note that the game is not historical accurate. Some references and event timeline may be correct but that is all. I think the progress of the story is alright considering the time it is set in but it is too draggy for me. Not much plot but if they can change the pace of the story and put in more plots it could be really interesting.I think Assassin's Creed is an alright game if sword fights, stealth/puzzle, parkour, conspiracy and assassination in the medieval time is your thing, but don't expect something really hardcore here.

****TL;DR AVAILABLE BELOW****Assassin's Creed is an excellent Historic-Science Fiction Action/Adventure Game mainly inspired by the novel Alamut written by Vladimir Bartol way back in 1938. The Game introduced many brilliant concepts and a totally different mindblowing plot which is very well connected from past to the present and you can devise many theories based on it. It was turned down by many people because it lacked variety and yes it did. I'm gonna list out the positive points between this game and its successors and also the reason why I think it's still an awesome game of the franchise. It had a special charm that none of it's successors had and will ever have.1. The Game is simple and doesn't involve customisation or anything and doesn't feature money,etc to buy stuff and stays true in assassinating your targets. Whereas the other games got deviated into buying stuff and oh god the renovation business started.2. Had some great concepts such as synchronisation for example, its not actually health but how close you (Desmond) could faithfully recreate the actions of ancestor, like if you carelessly fell off from a building or punched some civvy, etc. you lose the synchronisation, because the ancestor didn't do such thing in his life and was careful. It will regain over time and become stable when it is lost.Where as in other games you have health and armor and the way to replenish it is to drink some health tonic. Death in all these games is actually just a bad sync-up where you replayed the ancestor's memory event so bad that you lost touch with the original one's completely, so the Animus reinitialises back to the point where it made sense before you screwed it up entirely. So basically Ezio, etc. actually dies when you run out of it. Checkpoint restart is just a game mechanic. You can say that the Animus is still re-initialising the scene, but you died from lack of health, not loss of synchronization, So the Synchronisation no longer makes sense, so technically it was very well implemented and made some real actual sense in this game. And there are some other concepts which were not only solid and made sense but also gave a definite depth to the game.3. It has darker and gritty atmosphere with well suited background scores as you scour for information about the target in various ways which gives you this 'Assassin' feeling. While the other games had peaceful and relaxing score not stating that they're bad but this one had better and showed how dark and unsafe the world is and was perfect for its Middle-Eastern setting.4. The Chase Theme (Access the Animus as per OST) of this game is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ EPIC. ""You are not a bloodthirsty berserker, nor an invincible warrior cutting through waves of guards - you are a blade in a crowd, someone, who doesn't exist...until the blade has pierced your targets throat. As the bells echo throughout the city and the guards draw their swords against you, you realize it is time to run...run and become no one once more.The one thing that the original Assassin's Creed did better than ALL other sequels (everything up to Syndicate) is making you realize when it's time to run.﻿""Source:

(Check the comment section)5. The dialogues are surprisingly deep and interesting, only downside to it was it didn't feature any subtitles and sometimes cannot make out what they are saying because they sometime speak foreign language and won't speak simple english at all.6. Unlike other games where you scale a building like spidey, it is slow paced and that is great because it is realistic, but oh well people are just too impatient. 7. Every assassin in the order abide by the three tenets of the creed as in the game's title. In other games there is no mentioning of the creed and completely lost the meaning of the game's title itself and became a milking title instead.Plot wise, the game is very short without considering the repetition but its really well made and it is just the beginning of the story as it throws you at a cliffhanger at the end. The Visuals are pretty neat too. It was so demanding back then in its time of release and even after all these years, it still really looks good.TL;DRPros:Mindblowing ConceptsEpic storySuperb Graphics in its timeA Great History TeacherRealistic slow paced free running parkourThe Most challenging game in its seriesDeep and interesting dialoguesSound FX, even the tiniest sounds can be heard (Such as while climbing)Dark and Gritty atmosphereOnly AC game which gives you the 'Assassin' feelingWell suited Background scores by Jesper KydCons:Can be awfully repetitiveNumerous collectiblesCan't swim lolSome unwanted parkour glitchesMissing minor features a game should have (ex: blank radar,subs,etc)Repetitiveness cast aside, it's a gem that's pretty rough around the edges but it's sad that many people don't see it that way. Also this is the point where Ubisoft acquired the Tower Fetish Syndrome9/10 "

												After over 50 hours into this game, I can honestly say that Assassin’s Creed 1, is a magnificent game. This game is the first one in the series and I have to admit that I do regret my latecoming to the series, but I am glad that I decided to go straight to the beginning rather than AC2, which has been said to more ‘improved’ in lots of areas. I will spilt up my review into a couple of ‘sections’ before giving my overall thoughts and score. Please note that throughout this review, I will try to be as spoiler-free as I can be. Story -The story is the real meat of AC1 and it is the game's strongest point. You, as Desmond Miles, are captured by Abstergo Industries whom wishes to access your genetic memories in order to obtain the memories of Altaïr, whom is Desmond's ancestor and is an Assassin whom you play as while in the Animus - a machine that allows you to access Altaïr's memories. There are a lot of things you don't learn straightaway like why does Abstergo want Altaïr's memories but later on, through Altaïr's storyline and Desmond's, you discover that Abstergo desires something specific found within Altaïr's memories. You begin the game as Altaïr who is in Solomon's Temple with two other Assassins, in a mission to retrieve the Piece of Eden. While there, Altaïr finds Robert de Sable (Grandmaster of the Templars) and attempts to kill him, breaking all the tenets of the Creed with his arrogance. As a result of this, an assassin dies and Masayaf (The Creed's Base) gets attacked by the Templar Order. As this was Altaïr's fault, Al Mualim (Leader of the Assassins) strips Altaïr's rank as a 'Master Assassin' and demotes him into a novice. For the majority of the game, Altaïr is on a mission of redemption and regaining his rank as the only way to do so is to kill nine Templars. Well, the story is much more complex and interesting than that as you learn that these Templars are all tied-together and that Al Mualim didn't choose these nine for the heck of it. Throughout the course of the game, Altaïr learns many things and he undergoes a large character development, in his quest for redemption. The story is engaging and gripping - so much so, at one point, I played three days straight just to learn more on the story. That's how good it was! Characters  - The game has a strong cast of characters in my view (At least in the main story on Altaïr's side) - Altaïr, Al Mualim, Robert de Sable, The Nine Templars, etc etc. All of these are very strong characters with Altaïr's arrogance and Al Mualim's wisdom, which makes the main story ever so interesting and engaging. There are minor things that could have been better like the fact that even though Altaïr is middle-eastern, he has an American accent, which is entirely realistic. Another thing concerning Altaïr is his backstory, as I would have loved to learn more about his character as we learn very little of his past in the game. But now, we shall slip to the other side and talk about Desmond Miles. Desmond Miles, is an 'okay' character in my opinion, I heard a lot about the criticism on his character and storyline, and I can see why as we know very little on Desmond as well (Altaïr is a strong character though, so it works for him) but Desmond in itself is a little bland. We don't see much personality from him and I, found myself, wanting to go back to Altaïr, a lot. I should note that I don't hate Desmond as a character nor his storyline as I saw potential, but I'm unsure if in the other games whether this changes or not. I should also say that towards the end of the game, that was the point when I was interested in his storyline before recieving a large cliffhanger (Thanks, Ubisoft). Gameplay -The gameplay is the biggest flaw in the entire game. Okay, you have three cities to play in - Damascus, Acre and Jerusalem. Within those three cities, you have three districts - The Poor District, the Rich District and the Middle District. The gameplay connects with the story of killing the Nine Templars - in preparation for the nine Templars, you have to the SAME thing nine times. You have to climb viewpoints within each district in each city to unlock investigations (things like pickpockets, interrogation, eavesdropping etc etc) which helps you acquire enough information to assassinate the target. In the first three targets, you have to do 2 investigations, and for the rest you have to do - 3 investigations. So, you pretty much do the same thing nine times. Climb up high places, unlock investigations, do the required amount of investigations then finally assassinate the target. At first, I thought this was an interesting mechanic and added more immersion to make it seem like how an assassin would really do it - as stealth and information are key, however after doing it numerous of times, I found it repeitive and frustrating. So much so, that I sometimes wished I could cut to the chase and get to the actual killing; thankfully the game makes each Templar unique with interesting and compelling stories. I was patient enough and managed to push myself through the repetitive gamplay solely for the story, and I sincerely hope that the gameplay had been improved upon in AC2 and all of the games in the franchise. Combat  -In AC1, you have 4 choices to fight with - throwing knives/a fighting knife, a hidden blade, a sword and your fists. I myself loved the fact that I could jump around the roof and take out my hidden blade and stab the unsuspecting guards. The controls for fighting are a struggle at first as you have a lot of skills to remember and in combat, you can fumble around and confuse one ability with the other causing you to mess up in combat, but I eventually adapted to it and learned to use it. I could tell from early on, that this game was intended for controllers rather than a mouse-and-keyboard but honestly, it's not ""too hard"" with mouse-and-keyboard but it is a struggle at the beginning, and is one concern that should be addressed as it may not be what certain people would like, so I would recommend you to be patient - take advantage of the fighting tutorials and use them to help you get better at the controls, or if not - use a controller, as the game seemingly wants you too. Setting  - AC1 is set during 1191 - in the middle of the Third Crusade, and the majority of the story takes place within the Holy Land. This was rather a nice and unique place and time to play in, as I didn't know many games that was set in during the Crusades and the Holy Land where King Richard 'the Lionheart' and Salahuddin are in a war with each other, for either the protection of Jerusalem (in Salahuddin's side) or the capture of Jerusalem for Christianity (in King Richard's side). When I first heard about the setting, I was really interested as this was quite a nice place and time to set a game in, and while I admittedly do not know much on the Holy Crusades, I am very interested in history. It should be said that this game shouldn't be played for it's historical context, as obviously it wouldn't be historically-correct but it was a lot of fun to see Jerusalem and see how the Third Crusade affected the Holy Land, so I consider this to be one of the game's strong points. Overall  -Overall, my final verdict for this game is an  8/10  with the game's strengths being it's story, setting and intriuging characters such as Altaïr as well as the fun parkour. However it's major flaws are its repititive gameplay as well as the 'clunky' controls for combat yet I recommend being patient enough to deal with them, as this game has a compelling story and an amazing setting. Thanks for reading! My Scoreboard –1/10 ---> 4/10 – Not worth it.5/10 ---> 6/10 – Below Average/Mediocre.7/10 – Above Average. 8/10 – Great. 9/10 ---> 10/10 – Outstanding + Must Own.			"

												Eh, still my favorite game in AC story-wise. While all AC stories are good one way or another, I really wish they'd reboot it from the start someday, and fix their ultimate mistake they made with Unity (that rendered their further works - unappreciated, even if actually good). Mechanics are surprisingly good, and story is just amazing.			"

												This game runs pretty well, it's noticeably dated to me with things popping in and such but I'm sure we can all make allowances for that with the age of the game.If you, like me really want to be playing with keyboard and mouse, and not resorting to a controller, I urge to you take caution over the titles after this one as the camera will drive you mad. They all seem to share some sort of mouse acceleration issue that will make moving the camera with the mouse unplesant and annoying at best. This one does not share those issues, has a fantastic story and the only flaw is the gameplay can be a bit repetitive - certainly a classic regardless of this though!			"

												Classic frustration, that seems to be the best way I can describe this game. Seriously I wanted to assassinate everyone at Ubisoft going through this game, it WILL make you curse, it WILL make you scream, it WILL make you drown in a puddle of water even though you're a god-like assassin who can jump from insane nosebleed heights, no really it will do that.The thing is I kinda like being frustrated, I kinda like sitting there yelling and cursing at my screen, if I'm not then the game is boring and not worth my time. I've started and stopped playing this game so many times... but I always come back.If you're going to play any of the other Assassin's Creed games, and I recomend that you do, you have to play them from the start. It's a story, one that progresses through the series, and not a bad one. One that is suppose to be made into a movie soon too, a whitewashed version of the story (and please feel free to protest that fact to the company).			"

												I spent about 20 hours with this game, including the 2+ hours spent replaying major sequences because the game broke. Including the final battle - I had just beaten him and the game crashed, and the restart was a good 20 minutes earlier and had to be replayed.  The technical issues with this game on PC are embarrassing, especially considering how long ago it came out. As for the game itself - it's an open world game that punishes you for exploring the open world - the dichotomy between your range of motion and the responses to the world to your action is really weird, and doesn't support the goal of the game.  The number of activities available is pretty small for this kind of game (climb towers, help citizens in battles, and then some mission-specific tasks that are the same every time). There are flags to gather, for no purpose.  There are templars to kill. For no purpose. It's like they read a guide on how to put an open world game together, but forgot to make it worthwhile.  Which is too bad, because the environments are beautiful, and not something you see in many other games (Middle East in the Crusades era). Fighting isn't horrible, but it isn't great. All the pieces are there, but it doesn't cohere into a very good game; especially in light of the games that have come out since, it doesn't stand up for a return visit.			"

												Overall, the game was really good and realy drew you in. I got it when it first came out and it was awesome!Pro's: Open world and one that is truly vast and very highly detailed.Gameplay/Mechanics were simple, intuitive and easy to master.Good music and wonderful voice acting. Dunno it's just me or not, but no voice acting oftentimes ruins a game for me save a efw rare exceptions (Star Ocean: The Secord Story, Legend of Legaia, etc.)Adoring the parkour and running method, along with all the architecture built in to incorporate that.Being able to stalk your prey, gut 'em, then walk away as people start to freak was fun.There's plenty of content to make for plenty of game time.There are several small things I won't list, as well, that make interactivity fun and interesting, at the very least. Especially during the cut scenes.Con's: As for being open world, keep in mind that there is a reason you cannot actually explore everywnere at once, but get sections of the full map. I'd say way, but it'd be a spoiler and you learn very early into the game as to what this is about.Sometimes, especially at the start, you may begin getting lost, mini-map or no.Puzzles can be difficult, but not impossible.

												A great start to the franchise. You play Altair, a young assassin full of himself and over confident with his abilities as an assassin. The gameplay is full of repetition, as you move on from one target to the next trying to complete your mission of eliminating the Templar threat in four large cities. The free running is slow and clunky compared to its successors. Even through the mess of problems, this game is a must play if you intend to play any of the other installments.			"

Comparing to others assassin's creed you have less different stuff you can do but the place where it is played is well done.

It's stunning and wouldn't have move for awhile just enjoying the view but the game progress won't do itself.			"

												Finally got around to play Assassin's Creed! Even though it's from 2008 the graphics still hold up quite well, however the side quests can make the game a little bit monotonous. I didn't really cared about them (I'm not a completionist) so I just played the main missions, with the narrative keeping me wanting to play the game so I guess it didn't suck that bad?Better to play in short periods of time (~1h-2h) so you don't get tired of it and give up.➡️️Final Rating: 7/10			"

												This game is a 'mostly recommends' from me. There's an awful lot of tedium, even if there's some great stuff in there as well.First thing's first: The futuristic portions absolutely suck, they're tedious, boring, have no characterisation, and lend nothing to the story or gameplay. Desmond is the least interesting character Nolan North has probably ever played in this game at least.Second: The gameplay... sort of sucks? There are a lot of extremely frustrating elements that got ironed out of future games. Walking in a group requires constant button pressing to lock you in place, deviating from that cover at all will immediately make guards hostile in many parts of the game world. This can be incredibly frustrating in the more open areas where you'd rather move quickly. And in crowds where you have to stay hidden, combined with 'crazy' npcs that will shove you which registers as your cover being blown and the guards descending en-masse... well it is controller-chucking levels of maddening at times.Third: The camera sucks. This game has no cinematography beyond the occasional opportunity to switch fixed camera angles (which has to be done manually at specific times for some reason). This is a problem games have in general, interesting voice overs but nothing happening visually. It's very dull even if you like what your ears are hearing. Like watching a CCTV video of a conversation in the middle ages. I spent what felt like genuine hours of the game making Altair do pirouettes by tapping left and right rhythmically.Aaaand griping over.This game had a flow and purity later games lacked in my opinion. It also had a focus on the philosophical ramifications of its story as well that the sequels had no interest in whatsoever. While the future sections were tedious and entirely prefunctory the main meat of the story was very enjoyable. There was a strong focus on what exactly the Assassin's creed  meant, which was parallelled with Altair's character arc and his evolving relationship with a couple of key characters. The actual assasinations held thematic weight too, with the game exploring each of the target's sins eventually cumulating with a monologue from the villains as they lie dying in your arms (a mechanic future games have, but without the meaningful exposition being given by the characters) offering their side of the story and their justification for their actions, lending a final human touch to them.It also hinges a final plot twist on something that initially felt like it was going to be a ""Wait, didn't they just?"" Chekhov's Gun that I genuinely expected the writers to have been ignorant of including, so it was a pleasant surprise that yet another video game plot hole was actually an intentional twist.The soundtrack by Jesper Kyd is as solid as to be expected. It has a modern, electronic, style that later games wisely ditched (along with Altair's inexplicable American accent), but I confess to really liking it still. Particularly the pulse pounding track that plays after a successful assassination as you run from the authorities and attempt to regain anonymity, it gave every sequence a moment of ""OH CRAP, LEG IT!"".Also, as anyone who has played the later games already knows, the controller prompts for the PC version are absolutely bewildering at first with you constantly trying to work out which is the 'feet' button.Its a shame there's such strongly frustrating elements in this game as I feel like in some ways it is also the best Assassin's Creed, before the plot became empty hollywood blockbuster fluff and the gameplay became a sequence of distractions and ""stay exactly 30 feet behind this NPC without breaking line of sight for about 15 minutes"" missions.

												Assassin's Creed is a strange game. The game is built up around assassinations, as you might have guess, but the actual assassination sequences are rather dull, linear and poorly designed and not really worth doing at all. The rest of the gameplay however, the gameplay that's been put in there for no reason other than to claim it's an open world game, is specatular. Running around the cities, jumping from building to building, evading guards is one of the best open world experiences I have had since Prototype.Your are put into the shoes of Miles Desmond who, through the magical wonder of a machine called ""The Animus"" get to live the life of his ancestors, or in particular, this one ancestor who happens to be a 12th. century assassin during the crusades. I guess they got lucky when he didn't have to live through the life of that other ancestor that was a 15th. century bar wench.The story gets quite a bit complicated as the life of Miles and his ancestor gets intertwined in a web of conspiracies and ancient secret societies. You know, the usual stuff. It's not a case of bad writing but it does get a little contrived towards the end and the lack of any strong and memorable characters hurts it a lot.The fighting is mostly a case of parry and counter facing numerically superior enemies who are, fortunately for you, quite weak. Learning the tempo to this is quite easy however and you'll get bored quickly with the regular combat.The assassinations, performed mostly with the trademarked ""I cut my finger off for laughs"" hidden blade, are usually a scripted sequence and often involved a chase scene of some sort. It's not particularly interesting and the amount of fighting and running that needs to be done means you'll never really feel like an assassin.The open world is where the action is at, the movement is fluid and quick and the scenery is beautiful. Running around the city being chased by a slew of guards is open world at it's best and I'd recommend the game almost purely on that fact alone.When it all comes down to it, it's a game that fails at what it's trying to do and succeeds at what it's not. It's a strange combination but still a good open world play, even if what was originally intended as the core gameplay is somewhat disappointing.			"

												If you were now 2008Assassin's Creed gaming community was waiting impatiently. Demo shows promised, almost the best game of the year. If someone for some reason is not aware of something, Assassin's Creed is a damn beautiful action movie a-la stealth-in-the-crowd in the scenery of the Middle Ages, with elegant duels, spectacular murders and parkour (where is Ubisoft Montreal without it?). The current release showed the other side of the game. Which developers without any remorse of conscience concealed. But first things first.The first thing you experience when immersed in the brainchild of Ubi is delight. And wild. Next-gene graphics, stylish videos, a dynamic dueling battle system. And, being for the first time in one of the cities in general is ready to put the game 10 out of 10 and nalepit something in the spirit of ""beast game 2007"". The streets here look natural, townspeople everywhere, noise, din. An obnoxious beggar begs for a couple of coins, somewhere nearby, an escort of dissatisfied guards looms, a preacher talks about the path of salvation. Well, you just can not help but praise the French for the elaboration of cities. And yes, if at the words of the crowd you have the image of one of Hitman's missions: Blood Money (well, where the streets are full of bots with zero intelligence), I warn you right away - there are not any dumb people poking into each other and into the walls. Pushing a random passer-by, he will certainly send a tart note to Altair. Seeing the unusual actions of the hero, the people will not forget to comment on them. Having arranged a street fight, someone will raise a cry, someone will even get into a fight, and someone in general will quietly come on guard. The same beggar will throw a stone at you when you climb the walls.As for architecture, in this regard, a tremendous work has been done. On each building you can climb on the windowsills, bars and ledges. Escaping from the guards, we are free to gallop on the railing, balconies pillars, bars, carts, bags of which here in abundance. Interaction with the scenery for five plus.Let's continue. And so Altair gets the job to kill 9 people. Our goals are hidden in three, differing in stylistics (like the gamut and the palette of the environment, and the architecture of the buildings) - Acre, Jerusalem and Damascus. The gameplay looks like this: we rush to the assassins' office, listen to recommendations, climb the towers, that would be highly appreciated by the sources of information, and after finding out everything we watch the chic movie and kill the victim. Hmm, for a start, not bad. We come to another city and there ... Everything is new and first.Variety ends exactly after you leave the first city. Bureau-climbing the towers-mining information-killing the target-again bureau. And so on until the end of the game, strictly according to this formula. Monotony and monotony make their black work. Assassins Creed gets bored very quickly and already in the middle you catch yourself thinking - you do not want to play it trite. Lack of enthusiasm in the gameplay does not allow to enjoy good aspects of the project. For example, an intriguing, non-standard plot, which develops immediately on two stages - in our time and in the Middle Ages.Again, the combat system is almost perfect. Describe the battle on the blade can be in three words - effectively, quickly, easily. Laconic duels like here, in general, you need to make a standard, and then krimsanie each other blades (which we see in most games) looks already almost ridiculous. And of course you can not ignore the crown of Assassin's Creed - mixing with the crowd. It is implemented quite simply, but we have not seen anything like this before - it's a fact.TOTAL: In general, a sad picture emerges. Ubi sami also ruined their masterpiece, making the perfect almost everything ... and all this forgetting to tighten the rich, interesting gameplay.Rating: 8.5 / 10Author: Alot			"

												The game mainly consists of assassinating 9 key figures throughout 3 districts of 3 cities. In order to assassinate them, you must first complete a few missions which boil down to collecting items, pickpocketing a person, or assassinating another person. There are 6 of these missions in each district along with around 10 missions where you save citizens from guards. You don't have to complete them all to move on in the story and there's no incentive to. You don't gain any kind of reward for doing anything beyond the bare minimum and even the activities that you do are extremely repetitive. The game looks and sounds like it should be fun, but it's basically just grinding the same things over and over with nothing to motivate you.			"

												This game is so amazing. i couldnt help but think of Prince of Peria the entire time i played it, although the 2 are very similar. you may have heard the game is very repetitive, however, on PC, there is enough mission variety for you to feel you do things only once per region. the controls are very difficult as well as combat, but it seems to get easier throughout the game. Parkour combat and unique routes of going around assassinations were all great fun. Before, i played, i didn't think there would be much story beyond ""kill 9 dudes."" Boy, was i wrong, the story is great, even with some twists and turns. I love the ancient Middle East setting, although i havent played any other assassin's creed games yet. The prsent day story line is actually really good as well despite what i heard, especially after the main campaign is completed... Easily a 9/ 10 now one of my favorite games.			"

												(I own this on a CD, and that was where I put in most of my play hours)Assassin's Creed has come very far as a franchise. Is the original game still worth playing? Yes. Absolutely. If you can get it to work.POSITIVES: The roots of everything that made the franchise famous are in the first Assassin's Creed. The parkouring and climbing work well, the cities are large and colorful with unique atmospheres, there are plenty of collectibles to while away the hours collecting. The story is pretty good. It doesn't climb the heights attained by Assassin's Creed II / Brotherhood / Revelations, but Altair's journey as an Assassin who has fallen from grace and needs to redeem himself is great, even if it's been told before in other mediums. Graphics are decent (DirectX 10). The game world actually feels larger than some of the other Assassin's Creed games, since you don't fast-travel from one city to another (not at first); you travel on dusty dirt roads through mountains and villages from one city to another. There is a lot of country to explore, and none of the areas feel re-used (though sometimes they can seem extraneous).NEGATIVES: The game crashes, sticks, and stutters from a variety of issues. My issues were solved by unplugging my internet while playing. The servers that Ubisoft used to authenticate this game are now offline, causing the game to briefly freeze any time I tried to load a save or the game tried to create an auto-save. Lack of an internet connection tells the game to not even bother checking, so gameplay becomes smooth. Even for a game this old, it's hard getting a constant 60fps. If you're running the DirectX 10 version, I recommend setting the Compatibility Mode to Windows Vista SP2.INDIFFERENT: Activities and ambient conversations recycle constantly. Stealth doesn't have much variety: hide, walk slowly, or mix with monks. Combat is actually boring – once you get the counter ability, countering everything results in a one-hit kill. If you're out exploring the Kingdom, enemy guards are extraordinarily suspicious unless Altair walks at the slowest speed possible. Takes away from the pace of the game. Oh, and don't fall into the water; Altair can't swim, and dies instantly.VERDICT: A pretty good Assassin's Creed game whose repetitive side-activities don't undermine a decent first attempt at a stealthy open-world-parkour-hack 'n slash hybrid. Hopefully, you can get it to work properly.			"

												Oh man, there's so much to tell about this game that I'll probably spend hours writing this review.The game is pretty old already, so it won't you cost a lot of money. This is the first game of the Assassin's Creed series.Graphics:The graphics are pretty decent for the time the game was released. I played the game with everything set to highest. The landscape views (especially outside town) are a bit blurry (maybe on purpose).Sounds:Well I went back to Windows XP to play this game because the NPC's didn't have sound in Windows 7. But I can imagine that the developers did not expect people to play this game in Windows 7 because Windows 7 did not exist at the time of the release of the game.During exploration of the game the music changes depending on the activities that happen. You have combat music, sounds of slicing weapons, people screaming when they discover dead bodies.I also liked NPC's commenting on my failed attempts to climb buildings, falling and hurting myself and such.Gameplay:I'm very impressed with the gameplay. The game plays very smooth. It looks like they tackled all the bugs and it feels pretty natural to play. A controller is unfortunately not supported so I played with keyboard and mouse.The most challenging for me were the battles. Best way to do battle is to defend and wait for the right timing to attack.

I really love how they took care of these quests.The game made me feel like a real Assassin.

I wouldn't mind giving them some coins if I had any. I did hear that the next game (Assassin's Creed II) would have coins.Savepoints:The game saves automatically after each mission.History:I think this game is a good approach to mix gaming and history.

Of course what has been written in the books is not always true, right?Improvements:I could not run in the Animus room, which was a bit frustrating.The fields between cities were a bit useless to me. I could just use my horse to outrun all the soldiers on foot.I did not collect all the flags. There were too many.Also at the beginning I was not sure what to do with the Templars?

Well, now you can play that dream!  This is a game about running, climbing, jumping, being chased, hiding, and then finally you realize the truth - it's just way faster to stop and kill everyone chasing you than it is to run away in the first place.  I'm not exactly sure if this is what the creaters intended, but it's cathartic all the same.  All the same, this is a fun little game with a pretty-good plot (you won't really care about any of the characters, and the main character is only kinda interesting...his artificial arc definitely isn't going to leave you on the edge of your seat...so just get back to the stabbing).  As a ""stealth"" game, it comes a little short because it really isn't that except for the fact that you do kinda surprise people by suddenly stabbing them, then walking away (spoiler alert!).  (I mean, that would be surprising unless you live in like New York or Chicago or Detroit or LA where you kinda expect random people to do this.)  As a console port, the controlls are hillariously wonky to the point of comedy, when your character alternates being being a master acrobat to being the most clumsy creature in the world, seemingly at random.  The fighting is pretty much the same.  This game does have some silly camera tricks, though it (generally) sometimes avoids annoying angles, unless you are fighting.  It has automatic checkpoints, but the saving isn't really a big deal, and it tends to save every time you need it to.  This isn't a difficult game, at all, but I think it's supposed to be all about the ride.  It CTDs very rarely, but it's nothing to worry about.  Overall, it's a better than average ride, all things considered.  Oh, yeah, I got all the flags and templars, which takes like a million hours, and do you know you get exactly NOTHING for so doing.  Oh, yeah, ignore the flags and templars, unless you hate yourself :|			"

												Alright...it's time I reviewed.Let me just right off the bat say that truly the only reason to buy any videogame is to help support the artist who struggled to make it (and, well, to get some entertainment in the form of a non-alcoholic beverage). And that's exactly what Assassin's Creed does...for like two hours.So here's my issue: it's way too freaking repetitive. You meet up with Al Mualim (hope I spelled that right), your boss, get berated, get a mission, complete one of many repetitive tasks (such as jumping off buildings and saving insanely helpless citizens) in order to even be able to DO the mission, then you do the mission and head back to Al Mualim to start the process all over again. Seriously. You do it so many times you easily accumulate over ten hours (even if you speed-rush).Yahweh, Allah, and God-- I'm just as unfocused and ADHD as the next guy-- so how the hell was this game so popular?!Well, I've come to a few conclusions which I will highlight as the positives of this game:1. It's historically accurate2. Graphics are great. Still hold up after more than a decade3. Has an interesting premise-- which is hard to get to because there are so many mundane and repetitive objectives that get in the way4. Very diverse. Represents many cultures5. Offers two sides of an argument that's been going on for thousands of years6. You get to be a mother-loving assassin (or at least I hope Altair loves his mother)It's for these reasons that I believe the Assassin's Creed franchise has prospered, and I hope to see improvements in the next game that I play, which will most likely be the second one...I just hope I can be bothered.

												/!\ WARNING - THIS IS MORE OF A ""MEH"" RATING RATHER THAN A FULL APPROVAL /!\ At the time, I found Assassin's Creed to be a somehow cool game. At first I felt immersed in the game's world, and I liked the parkour-type of gameplay.But the issue is that the game gets very repetitive, very fast: find a tower, climb it, explore the city, do some unvaried missions, kill your target, repeat.Overall, I found the game to be more boring than entertaining, and I'm not afraid to say I played it mostly for the story rather than the gameplay itself.Rating: 5.5/10 - A good idea with an interesting scenario, but not varied enough to be played again. The sequel is better in every way and form.			"

												assassins creed is not a terrible game but it is just very repetitive to the point where you go to this place kill this guy, go to that place and kill that guy, so it just gets kinda boring and if you want to play this game before playing the others then just watch the ending of it on youtube because it is not worth playing through yourself.

The game crashed like 10 times in total of playing it. But aside from that, highly enjoyable game with well developed characters, interesting plot, and beautiful landscapes.Best part, though, no uplay.			"

												Assassin's Creed is a bit of a mixed bag. It's very well presented and entertaining, albeit repetitive and mundane at moments. My favorite aspects of the game are the story and general ambiance. The plot follows Desmond, a bartender who's kidnapped by a corporation due to his lineage to assassins. After he's forced into a simulation that recreates the past by using the user's DNA, the player assumes control of Altair, a Crusades-era Middle Eastern assassin. After failing to follow a tenet of his organization, he's ordered to assassinate a set of targets in order to redeem himself. As he investigates his targets, he and Desmond begin to unearth a series of conspiracies. It's an interesting, well-written, and believable story. While it isn't remarkable, it manages to entertain.In terms of atmosphere, the game has a simply sublime aesthetic due to it's blend of a Crusades-era Middle Ages and a modern-day subtle cyberpunk setting. The art direction is also great, and as a result it's visuals are arguably better than some later iterations in the series.However, gameplay-wise, it fails to live up. The story segments are enjoyable, however, in order to reach these segments, Altair has to investigate his targets. This consists of repeatedly racing across the map, beating up a target for information, and so forth. The game is also infamous for it's collectibles, which are arduous to collect and fail to provide a proper reward. Overall, Assassin's Creed is worth playing if one's interested in it. It's a game that was simply too ambitious for the time, and was rushed out in order to sell to the new console generation.			"

												Ok. So I was postponing playing this game for a looong time now (b'cause, you know - ubisoft. Plus I tend not to play highly hyped games right away, unless they are titled Mortal Kombat). And I have to say this game is lovely regardless few glitches here and there.Pros:- Action takes place in early middle ages (crusaders in middle east). Personally one of my favourite chapters in history.- Climate. Impressive, large cities. Architecture is amazing, brings up the spirit of the times. Music adds gracefully to this.- It's a climbing simulator.- It has ""find the flag"" mini-game.- It has story line! (don't get me wrong. If AC was only climbing simulator with find the flags mini-game it would be joy enough). Story is pretty interesting although not earth shaking. I like the feeling of ambiguity that Altair's last chats with his victims bring in.- You can try to play stealth if you wish.- Action oriented. Assassinations are pretty flashy and possible interactions with so many objects in the game can cause interesting twists. (I.e:  scored one templar kill by accident: was being chased, attracted attention of some templar I hadn't even noticed. He fell down the roof leaving me happy, although somewhat puzzled).- Antagonist and Protagonists: they are interesting in design. They don't feel cliche.- Open ending. Cons:- Weird one time glitches:  Damascus contact's face started to melt down while we were chatting. Altair froze mid jump from horse back, and memory had to be reloaded. - Sometimes game breaking bug may happen: dead body carefully put on the ground might twitch and fell of the roof, causing havoc on the streets. Dead bodies can even jump high to the sky, before they fall. Pretty creepy. - Repetitive:  people who might not enjoy flags finding as much as I do can find this game repetitive. In each city there are flags, and sub-quests (view points, rescue civilians, some informer missions) that are either the same or very similar (informer missions may slightly very).- Out of 3 major cities, Damascus and Jerusalem feel the same (except one has yellow and the other green filter on). Travelling to Acre I could feel that this conquered by crusaders city is different and had it's own western-like touch to it. - Fighting mechanics is simplified and a bit clumsy, especially when you face a lot of enemies. - You will not exit this game easy on PC...In general though: game is fun to play. And I think I do understand now, how this title is so popular. It's just joyful climbing simulator re-skinned packed with action moments. ;)			"

												Assassin's Creed in one word; repetitive.     To begin, there was a fair bit I did enjoy about the game including: the parkour movement system, the story, and the ability to improve with the future games. The parkour movement system was what really made the gameplay enjoyable for me personally. It was new and fresh at the time, and was a grandfather to some of the newer generations of parkour movement systems in and out of the Assassin's Creed series. The story kept me hooked through out the series and is important for this game in particular and for future games. Even if you don't think you'd enjoy this game or don't want to play it, I would definitely recommend watching a play through or reading a summary of the plot for story purposes. Lastly, I liked how this game left room for improvement. This game did have a fair bit I personally didn't enjoy or thought that could be better, and with future games we see the improvements come and the games becoming more fine tuned.     With every game there are always pros and there are always cons. This game had a few key cons, the biggest of which I think were: the repetitiveness, lack of stealth, and hand to hand combat. This game is infamous for it's reptitive side missions, all in which are exact clones of one another with just the information changing through out the length of the game. This makes the game harder to play and stick with when you do the exact missions over and over and lose interest in them. Another thing I didn't like about this game is it's MAJOR lack of stealth. For a game titled; ""Assassin's Creed"" the first thing that comes to my mind is assassin, which then leads to stealth for me. This game however, has no easy or obvious stealth. There are some points in which you are required to be ""stealthy"" and shadow informants. There is also the fact that you can stealth assassinate the main targets, but that is never easy or as satisfying as it should be. For a game that screams it should be stealth, it really doesn't have a stealth aspect. I see this game more of a action game then a stealth game. The hand to hand combat is also a big let down for me as well. It wouldn't be if I didn't play a role as big as it does in this game. With some of the side missions you are required to ""Rough Up"" some informants for some information, in which you have to beat them down with your fists. With a game mechanic as big as this, you would think they would have it polished as best as possible. However, they left out one of the biggest things possible; counter attacks. With any weapon you use, when you're in battle you can counter attack, making it extremely useful. With hand to hand combat however, you can not. Making the combat a back and forth fight and also making it stale to play. Another notable thing I would mention when telling about this game to a friend is how the collectables in this game have no meaning. Especially in the steam addition as there are no achievements for them.     So, all in all. Would I ever recommend it to a friend? Yes. If you can look past the repetitive side missions, there is still fun to be had with this game and good story to gather from it as well. I would not recommend more then one play through or would not see people playing this game more then once back to back, but I do think people who want to get into this game should definitely check it out. Whether you want to get into this game or just find a game with a parkour movement system, this is a fun game that can give you a play through out of it. I do however warn that if you're looking for a stealth game, DO NOT buy this game. This game is far from that.			"

												Just as good as the first time back in '08. Gameplay is repetitive with only 3 main cities (Damascus, Acre, Jerusalem) and your home base (Masyaf), but the story's what drives the experience.The gameplay itself can be (very) glitchy at moments, especially when free running; your weapon arsenal isn't as extensive as the other games, but it does the job wonderfully; there're no negative drawbacks to not being stealthy, so be as crazy as you want. These things don't detract from the enjoyment of the game, but can be frustrating when you have to escape after assassinating your target. This is a series in its infancy, we all know where it goes from here with the numerous added enhancements and features.Graphics-wise it's held up quite well; the environments still look gorgeous and the attention to detail for both the cities and history still fascinates me to this day. The audio, on the other hand, is alright for the main characters and targets, but is recycled for the NPC townsfolk and you can hear the compression in some of the dialog. This is a port, so it's understandable.Despite the minor glitches and audio complaints, I still highly recommend this game to veterans of the series and those who have never played the series before. Experience the ongoing, generational struggle of the Assassins against the Templars. Become one with the Brotherhood. Live the Creed.			"

												If you would like to know what the fuss is about this franchise you came to the right place - sure, the first episode is at least 6 years old but it still looks good and plays smoothly. Sure, it is not as ""refined"" as the rest - it has its shortcomings but many you can only realise once you played the sequels. It has its repetitive side missions, yes, the combat is a bit more difficult than in current gen games (even controlling the protagonist requires you to learn several ""stances""), yet, this was what started it all and to understand the rather complex and detailed story of the franchise you have to start with Altair's journey.If you do not like the first ride you can leave the rest. But if you grow to like the Assassins you are in for a very long journey, my friend!			"

												Assassin's Creed is the beginning to a engrossing saga by Ubisoft. The story is first rate and the action sequences are seamless. The game has a third-person point of view and allows you to easily traverse terrain, climb buildings and initiate combat sequences from all-out action to stealth assassinations. The game itself is a wonderful breakaway from the all too common first-person shoots. Even though the game seems marketed towards consoles, Assassin's Creed does not forget PC players and offers a fairly steam-lined mode of control. By no means should Assassin's Creed be overlooked by gamers as its on-going story is critically acclaimed.			"

												From the Animus to the streets of Jerusalem, Assassin's Creed shines with graphics, storytelling and great action.  Climbing buildings has never looked easier than with Assassin's Creed.  My only gripe about this game is the repetition, eventually, all the action sequences seem repeated but in different places in the city.  Nonetheless, you owe it to yourself to try this game, just for the sheer fun of jumping from rooftop to rooftop.			"

												Assassin's Creed - The game that has almost as much S'ses in it as Mississippi has (say that out loud three times in a row and earn your way to become an anchorman on the news)Well, I played this game a long time ago on an not Steam-related platform, but since I bought the whole franchise lately I might as well give my two cents on this Indie-Game as well. Who made it? Ubiso... Well, nevermind.As far as my memory goes back and as strong as it is, I will tell you something about the Story first. You are playing as Ezio Auditore... later in another game... No, you are someone else in this game. You are the allmighty overpowered and underestimated Desmond Miles (who happens to be the main character but nobody gives a sh*t). Thanks to modern technology you are able to lay down and virtually slip into the Anime (or what ever that thing was called) to connect with the memories of your grand-grand-granddaddy's. Even so that in later Episodes of the game you have been given live to the next generation and still are genetically able to relive the life of your Grandparents story, you are pretty much unable to resist doing what the evil doctors tell you when they first put you in the Animu (or whatever) to become Altaïr, first of the Assassins in your Bloodline.Now, even so that Raymond is unable to fight back with an simple ""No"", Altaïr is able to climb the highest buildings around, take a snapshot from above, jump and fall a gazillion miles into an haystack precisely and is still able to get up after and kill a bad guy just before he takes an relaxing walk through the town on the rooftops. Shame on you Superman, you will never be that cool.As the Story goes on, you will find out that your major target as an assassin are the Knights of the Cross, which are all over the place. After their search for taking the land and in search for the wholy grail they slowly running into your blade with open arms. You for your turn as the player would wish for Coconuts instead of the endless horsetrips through the outbacks of mountains and deserts. It is not that it doesn't look good, it is more about the ""running in circles"" that is taking the fun out of it.Desmond gets out of the Anonymus from time to time and sniffs around, when it is possible, to become aware of the connections between the past and present lifes until ""Spoiler"" the game almost ends.As clever as it is and as good as it sells. All we want is to climb up the buildings and play death from above on every single enemy in town.7/10 Lonesome Cowboy			"

												I haven't had this much fun causing mischief since Thief 2.Assassin's Creed is, at its heart, a series of minigames. 1) Scale towers to get a look around; 2) eavesdrop; 3) fight city guards who are harrassing citizens; 4) interrogate know-it-alls; 5) pick pockets; and above all, 6) run like heck from city guards until you can ditch them in a cart full of hay, a rooftop gazebo, or blend in on a bench. But there is variety in these challenges, and all of this is stitched together with the most beautiful sandbox cities since GTA IV. You set your own pace in this gorgeous game.My complaints are few: no indoor environments in cities, too much late-game swordplay, and dreadfully long mandatory cutscenes.Lastly, AC offers fluid swordplay, and a parkour-like experience scrambling over rooftops. It's just fun to play, and the right length.  Thumbs up.			"

												This game takes place in the same era as the Third Crusades as well as partally in modern day. You play as Desmond as you enter the Animus to relive your past as Altiar. There is so much to do in this game as well as so little. You can spend countless hours freeroaming and completing every objective to become an ""honorable assassin"", or you can go right through the campaign and have the thrill of assassinating your enemies over and over. The gameplay is fantastic as you not only just bullrush in and attack your enemies, but you also must escape and be stealthy like a true assassin. There are a few glitches in the gameplay as I kept running up the wall when I was trying to run up the ladder (or maybe that's just my own incompitance in inability to be a true assasin). The fact that you cannot swim was frustrating, especially in the last level. The fact that the guards targeted me as an assassin whenever I ran past them was a little frustrating as well.

												AC is the game that started it all, mixing some excellent open world action / parkour with an overarching story (and meta-story) that could easily be the screenplay for the next big sci-fi film.  It also nailed the basic open world action gameplay mechanic of combining primary objectives with optional side quests (batman), climbing towers to make nearby objectives appear on the map (farcry 3), and fluid hand to hand skirmishes that become more complex as the game progresses (batman).  AC nails these mechanics right out of the gate.The meat of the game is exploration of the game world, set in the middle east some time during the crusades. There are 3 cities to explore, each with similar architecture but a distinctive feel.  The player can only access a few sections of the city initially, and more become available as the story progresses.  Being an assassin, the primary missions involve dealing death to some high profile victim in a specific city and section.  Secondary objectives are a mix of ""protect the citizen"", ""assasinate these minor dudes"", pickpocketing, evesdropping, and parkouring challenges.  There are also flags scattered around that you can pick up but there was little incentive to do so.Story sections and major missions feature a brief cinematic that is rendered in the game world.  Often you can switch to another camera position by clicking a button on the joystick.  The cinematic then seamlessly returns control to the player.There is also an overarching ""meta story"" that is told from the perspective of a young man who is apparently a descendant of the assassin you are playing.  There is a device called the ""Animus"" that you lie opon... it then allows you to access and play out the memories from the past, and also influence (apparently) the original outcome.  I won't reveal anything else about that... you will need to discover that for yourself.All is not perfect though there are some annoyances:> The gameplay is repetitive, with only minor variance as your level increases.  The ""boss battles"" tend to become more complex but the meat and potatoes are samey.> The cities have some differences but honestly if you plopped me in one city and asked me to correctly identify it, it would be difficult.  They don't feel different enough, adding to the samey-ness.> The textures and character models are a bit crude.  I would definitely recommend the hi res texture mod, which you can find on the steam forums.> This game was designed with an XBOX controller in mind... you will NOT want to use a mouse.  Not necessarily a huge annoyance but I for one prefer mouse and keyboard over joystick.All in all I enjoyed the game immensely and would definitely recommend it.9/10 "

												Assassin' Creed, this is where your long journey through the entire series begins. You start off as an ordinary bartender who is kidnapped and utilized for his ancestors' heritage. Through this process you are placed in a machine properly named the 'Animus', through which your ancestors' memories are viewed. In this game you see through the eyes of master assassin Altair, and the trials his must face to regain his master rank within the brotherhood. You travel to three familiar locations we have all heard about in history class, Acre, Damascus, and Jerusalem. Here you fulfill tasks and assassinations to progress the story. Spend your time wisely because there are plenty of viewpoints, citizen saving, and challenge missions to complete in each location, as well as uneventful flags to find. By collecting flags, you unlock additional memories of Altair.Pros:- Combat is easy to master.- Parkour responds well to your path.- The landscapes are beautiful for an 2008 game engine.- The story is engaging to follow and fully voiced.- Weapon upgrades are easy to obtain, you just continue through the story to obtain the next piece.- Controls respond extremely well, recommend using a controller.- The game is short if you just focus on main tasks. I don't recommend, however, if you're just in it to learn the story you could spend maybe an entire weekend to complete the main story.Cons:- It is dated so some players may dislike the old graphics compared to games of today.- Side-quests are heavily repeated and bland.- Bugs, especially when anyone hits the floor the game tosses bodies all over the place. Sometimes even you go flying somewhere and glitch out. Though it is also hillarious!- The transition between Desmond and Altair can get sort of annoying, especially when you want to progress during the story's juicy parts.- Flag collection. Very tedious and not so rewarding.- Uplay. I only dislike this for achievement purposes, and having another game software running just to play this game.To wrap it up, these are my opinions of the game. I enjoyed Assassin's Creed and I am planning to play through all of them the rest of the summer. The stories appear to get way better and I for sure would like to play through them all. The start of the series is short, but it educates the player well enough to understand what is conspiring between Assassins and Templars.  I recommend this game to anyone willing to start at the beginning of this promising series. Plus, Altair is pretty cool and his assassin attire is one of my favorites.			"

												Assassin's CreedStory - It gets a bit repetitive, do these investigations, go talk to some dude, kill this dude, go back to Masyaf, repeat. I'm not saying it's bad, it is fun. It's just the same objectives over and over again, EXCEPT for the last 2 memories. Those really got me wondering. The ending was really cool. Loved it. 7/10Storyline Length - 10-ish hours if you decide to do ALL the investigations. Around 5-ish hours if you want to rush it.AI - They have the exact same skill as you. They can counter, they can climb buildings, they can grab, grab break, dodge, so on. They're challenging. Especially at the start when you can't do ANY of those things. 9/10Experience - Other than the story being repetitive, you'll love this game for many reasons. You'll love it for Altair's amazing voice, the brutal counter-kills, the freedom you have once you've unlocked everything, the horses, Malik being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, Abbas being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's all just really glorious once you know how to play the game. 10/10Graphics - Pretty great for 2007. Could be a bit better on shadows though. 9/10 Sounds / Voice Acting - Well, Altair has an American accent despite living somewhere in the Middle East. I'm just going to assume that's the power of the Animus though. La shay' wakion motlak bal kollon momken. 8/10Controls - Like any other game I suppose, it's easy to learn, comfortable to play with. 10/10Overall - 9/10It's an amazing game, I feel like everyone should get a chance to play this, even if they don't really like action / adventure games all that much. I really enjoyed playing this when it first came out, and you know you've done an amazing job at a game if I still find myself enjoying it nearly 10 years later. I hope for the 10 year anniversary of this they make a remaster of this. It'd be so cool ^^			"

												This game takes place in the same era as the Third Crusades as well as partally in modern day. You play as Desmond as you enter the Animus to relive your past as Altiar. There is so much to do in this game as well as so little. You can spend countless hours freeroaming and completing every objective to become an ""honorable assassin"", or you can go right through the campaign and have the thrill of assassinating your enemies over and over. The gameplay is fantastic as you not only just bullrush in and attack your enemies, but you also must escape and be stealthy like a true assassin. There are a few glitches in the gameplay as I kept running up the wall when I was trying to run up the ladder (or maybe that's just my own incompitance in inability to be a true assasin). The fact that you cannot swim was frustrating, especially in the last level. The fact that the guards targeted me as an assassin whenever I ran past them was a little frustrating as well. All in all, I give this game a 9/10			"

												The one that started it all and in my personal opinion the 2nd best AC game out there.Warning: Contains major spoilers for Assassin's CreedAlso here's my ""BUY RANKS""1: Buy this game now!2: Wait till it goes on sale3: Try the demo first or if they don't have one wait till it's half off.(All opinion wise)4: Wait till they make it free or 70-90% off.5: Don't buySTORY: You are Desmond Miles a 25 year old man captured by a company known as Abstergo as they have captured you and have forced you to do something extraodinary: to relieve the memories of your ancestor in order to find an ancient treasue. You relieve the memories of Altair an assassin from the year of 1191. The story in this is great and makes you feel like there are two stories instead of one, the story of Altair's fight and stuggle against the templars and Desmond's involvment with Abstergo. Has one of the best twists I've seen in a game since it came out. 9.5/10GRAPHICS: The graphics in this game are of course dated since this was made in 2007. Still though they're pretty to look at and the 60fps wins me over with it's smoothness and textures but still it's dated. 7.5/10GAMEPLAY: Wow what can I say about gameplay, of course comparing the stuff you can do in AC compared to the others there's not much to do you only have 4 weapons, your fists,knive and mini knives,sword, and the iconic hidden blade but you do receive upgrades in the game as you progress through the main story. There are sidequests and with the PC version I was able to grab 4 more, annoying but helped in the main game. You can collect flags but to me there really was no point into them. Then there was the parkor and the view points....holy♥♥♥♥♥♥their amazing. With the awesomeness of free-running and viewing the map piece by piece by the climbing on top of a tower and viewing it while an eagle is in the background just screams badass. Even though there's not much to do except do main and side missions you still have your own bit of fun. 8/10CONCLUSION: AC is a great game and again in my personal opinion is ranked 2nd best in my book due to it being the starting point to the series and NO FULL SYNC! Hope to make more of these soon and thanks for reading my first steam review.:)BUY RANK:1			"

												I normally don't write reviews for such high profile titles since people generally know what they're getting into already, but I'm making an exception for this because it seems to split opinion so much, and after finally playing it, I can see why.Assassin's Creed is a 3rd-person, open-world, parkour-based sneak 'em up with Arkham style combat, Prince of Persia style traversal and Splinter Cell style stealth (try saying that 3 times real fast)... as well as having lots of collectibles, diving into bails of hay and punching poor people in the face. Yay! You play Desmond Miles, a man with two first names pretending to be a last name. Oh, and he's also a former assassin (apparently, it never really elaborates on that beyond the initial introduction) who's forced to explore the memories of his ancestor, Altair, during the crusades of the late 12th century. This is done through a device called the Animus which probes and records ""genetic memories"", the knowledge passed down through a person's entire lineage via their genes and allows them to live out those moments in their mind as if they were their own experiences... Yeah, just go along with it, coz that's more or less what the game asks you to do since that's as much as it bothers trying to explain it. Altair is a member of the Assassin Brotherhood, and after failing a mission and breaking the three main rules of the Brotherhood (don't kill in daylight, never get water on your target, and never feed them after midnight), is demoted and sent on a series of assassinations to restore his name and rank, but along the way discovers there is something much bigger at work connecting all his targets. Dun-dun-duuuuun! But this is where my first problem with the game crops up.The story just didn't grab me at all. It's incredibly ham-fisted in what it's trying to do, and rather than find it interesting or pushing me forward, it felt like it got in the way of the gameplay, and if anything, maybe even held it back. Had it been done without all the half-*ssed science fiction elements and instead remained tied to its time and setting it would have been a perfectly enjoyable story about the hidden histories that shaped the world and the shadowy organisations behind them. What we're given instead just feels too underdeveloped to truly care about in the end, much like the main characters, in fact. Desmond/Altair doesn't really have much range or depth, having about as much personality as a balloon with a serious face drawn on it, and at times comes dangerously close to being unlikable. And what's especially infuriating about them is how nosensical their choices seem or how nochalant they are about their situations, making it difficult for us to care about them. The voice acting is largely passable, but still very much of the old-school gaming mentality of sounding like a Saturday morning kid's show where half the characters sound like they're reading from a script and throwing subtly out the window rather than feeling like real people having real conversations. Any sense of naturalistic interaction is lost completely and only adds to the difficulty of being able to invest in the story or its figures, which is all the harder to bear given how much they focus on them being a thing you should care about. In fact, having come fresh off of finishing Portal 2 and hearing all the amazing voice work in that, it's made even more apparent just how mediocre it is here. But all that could be forgiven and forgotten, because what really matters is the gameplay, right? Well, actually... that's where the next problem comes.The structure is fairly straightforward. There's three main cities in the game connected by a large hub area, each city having three districts which are gradually unlocked one by one, and each district having a main target for you to eventually kill. You run around a district completing objectives which give you information on your target before having enough to finally do the deed itself. Objectives range from eavesdropping on conversations, interrogating enemy cohorts, saving citizens from vicious beatings, assassinating smaller targets, or several other tasks of little consequence. Unfortunately, though, that's pretty much the entire game right there. You'll go to one district, do all the objectives, complete the mission, then move on to the next one all excited to see what other fun and creative tasks you'll be given, only to find you have to repeat almost exactly the same events all over again. And that's the cycle the game repeats from start to finish. Once you've played the first district you've essentially played them all. There's nothing fundamentally wrong about the gameplay at its core, I just wish they'd given me something more to do over the 20+ hours I put into it. Sure, there's collectibles scattered everywhere in the form of flags... hundreds and hundreds of flags... but there's no real point to hunting them down. There's nothing awarded for finding them all, and beyond acting as intermediary save points they may as well not be there. Maybe if they had've unlocked files for real world information about the locations or the historical figures or the crusades themselves then they would have made for some compelling artifacts, but nah, nothing.Its main saving grace, though, are the View Points, buildings that can be climbed to uncover the map of the immediate area and locations of objectives. Monkeying your way up a structure then diving back down to street level can be fun sometimes, but largely it's the chance to take in the cities as a whole that impresses most, and they really are impressive. That's really the star of the game, in fact. The sheer scale of each city and the huge crowds that fill it along with the meticulous detail everywhere is clearly where a lot of work and love went here. The surface of almost every wall has something climbable if you look for it, and a vast array of beams and poles and scaffolding connects the buildings at every turn. I never tried it, but I wouldn't be surprised if you could make your way across the rooftops from one end of a city all the way to the other without your feet ever touching the ground of the streets and having to interact with all the filthy plebs below. I don't envy the people whose job it was to check that every structure was spaced correctly and that movement could be maintained as fluidly and enjoyably as it is. So I really have to take my hood off to them for that achievement.But while movement is a joy and tends to work just fine the majority of the time, combat is a whole other matter. The game really owes a lot to Prince of Persia, from the way it looks and feels, to even the majority of the animations which appear to be almost identical, but the mechanic I wish they'd abandoned from it is the combat. It was fine in small doses in PoP, but there's too much of it here that largely feels clunky and boring, with a fairly small weapon and move set, and little or no variety in enemy types beyond a palette swap or doing and taking more damage. Maybe if some enemies were in armour that gradually had to be stripped away, or some were on horseback or had other types of weapons that brought their own unique challenges it wouldn't have been so bad. Sure, there's always the option to run and hide, but even that can be tedious at times, given how often you'll have to engage with enemies.Overall, while it's not a bad game, with plenty of enjoyment to be had, it's just one that holds so much potential, yet, sadly falls short far too often. Had it been given another 6-12 months development time I'm sure it could have been a classic for the ages, but as it is, it's merely a good, enjoyable stop along the road to far better titles.			"

												First few hours it looks fine, but then it start to be extremly repetitive and boring, the controls are worst I have ever experienced. The AI will hit your nerves and mission only test your patience, means not fun at all. I wanted to get through the game just because of the story, but seems it is better to just watch custscenes on youtube.Im sorry to say that but this was very lazy work Ubisoft compare to Far Cry for example. Cannot recommend this game.			"

												i love this franchise so much that i want to give all of them 10/10 and call it done !But In All fairness i will review This game for u here :i finished this game more than 9 times on differrent platforms !Now there is a lot of thing going on in the franchise about story and the hidden secrets and everything ( WHICH i love and recommend u to see ), but i keep this review to GAMING and if u want the juicy details just search the web in general .ok let me tell you a few things first :NAME :it is that the name of the charachter altair, which is an arabic word that means : BIRD in general or a flying bird of not a specific type.FAMILY NAME : IBNE LA AHAD is also arabic meaning the son of no one . IT DOES NOT MEAN B*STARD ! it means son of no one, born from no one !i just want to point out that in assassins creed 1 or assassins creed bloodlines for PSP u dont see the family name !!!it was added either from assassins creed 2 or the brotherhood .in fact you see it in the begining of brotherhood but i dont remember AC2 right now !let me state this was a nice addition and was in sync with ac1 and was not one of the things that ruined the franchise or was not in sync, because many things were added in later assassins creed that are just not right ! this is not one of them.THE WORD ASSASSINS : is also arabic coming from the the world ASSASSIYOONS, which even in the game you hear on the people in masyaf tell altair : ""assassiyoons way "" or something alike that i dont recall, but he says ASSASSIYOONS !now assassiyoons come from the word HASSASSIYOONS which comes from the word HASHASHIYOONS which comes from the PERSIAN word ""HASHASHIN HA "" or "" HASHASSHIN S "" in english .NOW here is the important part : assassins or hashashin ha DID used to smoke HASHISH but the word HASHASHINS is not coming from HASHISH, in the old times around the 13th Century which was the era of the first assassins in PERSIA ! they used to call all drugs and medicines HASHASH, and at that time one of the incomes of the assassins where to sell medicine in general or HASHASH which later became whats known now as ASSASSINS !Check the pictures i uploaded on STEAM, if you combine what i wrote under the picture with the picture you get some funny juicy details.but you must have high knowledge to understand, for example why under Rafigh or Rafeek's Pic i wrote ALMUALIM when clearly hes not ALMUALIM !but then again it is almualim, then why would i write it there...??!?! Also almualim is arabic word meaning TEACHER !now i myself will PROMISE you that i will write a book about this franchise and i will be the one making tha last installment in its franchise . i can wrote 6 pages about what is LEAP OF FAITH !believe me there is a lot more to this game than the surface...---------------The Combat : is a lot better than the games that came after since it required more from the player than HEY JUST PRESS THIS BUTTON !-The Story : is ROCK SOLID ! i wont spoil it 10/10-The Character Altair is FANTASTIC ! it was THE BESTand ONLY RIGHT CHOICE EVER !- The GRAPHICS are EVEN BETTER THAN assassins creed REVELATIONS !!!- EVEN NOW U GET HIGH QUALITY ON PC ( even till 2020 or more its good... )-The way the developer, (SINGULAR 1 person) had the universe in his/her mind is marvelous . The controls and the gameplay and the hud is all designed at a deep level to make the universe come to life (UNLIKE SOME LATER ASSASSINS CREED GAMES !!! )The side missions are repetetiveThe travelings can be frustrating if you try to achive every in game collectible....As a game developer i promise you 1 day before i die, in the middle of world war 3, i give you the last assassins creed a 10/10 game with a gameplay taken back to its wonderfull roots and a story that sums up the entire franchise like no one will ever believe it !!!i give this game : 9.4/10reviewed by IMMORTALEADER			"

												I've started playing through all the ""old"" AC games again for nostalgic reasons I guess, and I can honestly say that you might as well skip this one unless it's on sale and you're a really big AC fan. A couple of issues with this game; The controls can feel very slow and clunky at times, especially when you're climbing towers (which you will be doing A LOT), the missions can get really repetitive pretty fast, walking through the streets and hearing people saying the same lines over and over again can get pretty annoying, same goes for the music when you get in a fight with a couple of guards, the vigilante missions where you help civilians feel like a chore and I got to the point where I just stopped giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥about them because there's absolutely no fun in doing them.I had to change and replace some of the game's files because the native controller support is worthless (AC2 has the same issue). It didn't take too long to fix it but it's something they could've easily patched in if they actually gave a♥♥♥♥♥♥ I also noticed at certain points the framerate seems to drop for no reason at all and there's nothing I could do about it. I liked the story and (most of) the actual main assassinations were pretty cool, but for 9,99 I would definitely skip this game. It was a great game for it's time but it hasn't aged as well as I had hoped. Again; if you're like me and you're trying to play through all the old AC games again, you might as well skip this one and start at AC2			"

												Best assassin's creed game, awsome story, that is based on real events and real people in real scenerios (unlike its sequals, and YES the assassins where supposed to be based on the real world Hashasins look it up!). What i like best is how it doesnt go too far into the relms of fiction and thus the game universe feals scarely realistic. Furthormore for the game mechanics and the missions are the best the game and series has too offer, it provides you with the choice and methods of how you kill your enamy or how you aquire information for it in whatever order you please. Also you go into the game nowing nothing about how the combat works but after a few replays of assassinations i found myself using the hidden blade and never getting a scatch as i badassly counter all my opponents moves.For computing issues, there is none, you can play fine with little lag on even the oldest of machines, if you have a problem you can lower the building texures or turn off some of the non-nescersery parts of graphics, even still they look fine at the lowest level. But i suggest not changing the character textures as they end up looking heleroius and unreal on the lowest character textures, but that never effects lag anyway. But anyway you should have little problem. Finaly the cities are pristine and perfect, using real world buildings, such as the Umhyyad Mosque, Temple Mount and the Catsle of Acre. Also the cities up into segregated class quaters, containing many souks (bazzars or marketplaces) and dingy dark allyways. However you will unlock these different areas as you progress through the game.Overall a 10/10 game, a great show to how a game should be made, and i highly reccommend you plays this.			"

												This is not as good as assassin´s creed II, brotherhood and revelations. But story of Ezio Auditore makes me to find out how great was Altair in battles against cruisaders. Compared to Ezio Auditore, Altair is forced to finish many repetetive missions. Unlike mentioned iterations of the Assassin's Creed franchise, the first game has a basic plot. Despite of mentioned negatives it is still fun to fight, climb and sneak around in the historical versions of Jerusalem, Acre, and Damascus and in such an intuitively way.			"

												Back when this game first came out I had bought it at full retail price on an Xbox 360 and I ended up hating it after seeing how bland it felt and how repetative it was. I ended up just giving it away to my cousin for his birthday after a few hours of playing.However many number of years later I just now bought it again for a $5 deal and I really fought to give it a second chance with a more mature mind and a better capable gaming platform. I am now a newly found Assasins Creed fan despite how horrible I viewed the game when it first game out and on console.Took me a bit of getting used to to understand the potential of the game once I fought through my first impressions and explored what it had to offer. Gameplay kind of seems like a unique style of ""travel"" instead of the old impression I had of it being a rock climbing simulation. Large sword battles and knife throwing action end up being really fun mixed with a pretty interesting story I now really like the game and finished it a few minutes ago.If you're like me, try giving it a second chance when a deal hits!

The series offers more than a good RPG backdrop but a continuous storyline that stretches beyond a typical RPG. After completing this installment (had been playing ACII when stopped during memory sequence 4 to play 1st AC/Altair) I finished ACII. The rich storyline and a deep one at that, surrounding Ezio makes playing this RPG series compelling, entertaining, and challenging. You will be challenged on many levels while playing this series. AC will seem simple after playing ACII, but if you like reading a book series, puzzles, different skill challenges, and realistic game play, you will enjoy this series... on some level. Looking forward to more Assassin's Creed story line and gameplay.p.s. the music sound tracks are soundtracks are awesome and worth getting... ACII, ACIII, ACIV(Note: have not finished and/or played ACIII, ACIV but do have the soundtracks, the music in all three are worth the purchase)			"

												This is one of my all-time favorite series. That's due more to Assassin's Creed 2 than this game, but if you're going to play it, you should start with this one. From the creators of Prince of Persia, the animations are top-notch.  Climbing, sword-fighting, and horse riding never gets old, and it has a great story as well.I played the first game on PC. AC2 had some issues with their online DRM, so I avoided that and played AC2 on my PS3. I found that I preferred to play this series in the living room, so I got Brotherhood and Revelations on PS3 as well.  But the game plays just fine on PC and I believe Ubisoft removed the online DRM, so that's no longer an issue.Sword fighting is graphic and bloody, and it only gets moreso later in the series, so probably not for the kiddies. The game contains some religious themes and tells a story that conflicts with the bible, so if that kind of stuff bothers you, you may want to stay away. Otherwise, it's an excellent conspiracy theory.			"

												This game might well have been ahead of its time in 2008. The graphics and setting and atmosphere are like being in the old coutry in 1200 AD. Its an original and exhilerating experience to play this game. Yet lets face it it plays clunky, I am always fighting with the PC commands to get the game to play the way I want it to. The screen freezes which means starting from scratch at the buarough { if the spelling is unprecise I am sorry ) is an unavoidable fact.Aswell as other glitches.However this is compared to the games of today which really is rather unfair.After all it was made in 2008 thats seven years ago in an ever changing industry.Although too it gets a little ominous at times with the same old routine from start to finnish.But in all I have to give this game a thumbs up and at its price is still one heck of a deal. Even if you were to pay twice the price of it now  it would still pay for itself in good fun entertainment value again and again.There is one thing though is its very frustrating to play because of the mechanics of the game.

												The game that launched the massive franchise. While many will say that this title is skippable for new players due to it's reptative gameplay I would say that you should consider picking it up to give you a basis for the world of Assassin's Creed and understanding the story of Altaïr.Keep in mind the game is quite a few years old now and that is something that impacts the gameplay (and amount of loading screens) but it is my personal opinion that it is a damn good game and a proper introduction to the franchise. If you plan to go all the way though the Assassin's Creed games (and you should since AC 2 and Botherhood are absolute gems) you should gather what lore you can because in the end you'll need it to make heads or tails of this game's universe.

												At first i tought that i would not get into assassins creed, i mostly bought this game to have something to play when i was bored but i really got into it. The gameplay is a little repetetive until you get to the assassination missions. The story is great and has alot of twists in it. When i finished the game i bought assassins creed 2 at once (not kidding). Definetly worth bying if you want a stealth game you can play for a while.			"

												It is impossible for me to look at the first Assassins Creed with fresh eyes. The series is one of the biggest things in gaming for me and many others. It is one of those games that are very easy to pick apart critically but are entrancing anyway. The sense of history is unparalleled as is the general entertainment value.The first entry is more a sketch of things to come than a fully realized game. It is clear just how much thought went into the story and the lore, but the actual gameplay is still quite limited. The variety of tasks is narrow indeed, and repetition is unavoidable. Development process was apparently cut a bit short and Ubisoft was quite surprised by the success. This is also a rough console port, with a menu system very possibly designed by Satan himself.Altair is a hard man and hard to like as well. He is completely asexual (in this game at least) and more intellectual than emotional in temperament. Yet this uncompromising attitude has it's benefits and Altair does not wear out his welcome. His voice actor, however, is a completely flaccid line-reader. Peter Renaday (Duncan from Dragon Age) steals the show as Al-Mualim. The gifted Jesper Kyd began a tradition of truly outstanding soundtracks here. Desmond Miles, in turn, began a tradition of being incredibly unnecessary in every single way possible.I would recommend the series as a whole for anyone interested in sprawling action-adventure games. Stealth is but one small ingredient. There is little to no challenge in the Assassins Creed series but it is a world to disappear into, with it's own logic and laws. I would also recommend playing II followed by Brotherhood before this.			"

												Классная, атмосферная игра. Одна из всей франшизы где хочется исследовать каждый уголок карты(такое чувство придет только в 3 части, которая делалась на скорую руку и видно что многое просто вырезано). Данная часть доработанна до конца и даже не смотря на то что в последующих частях переработают управление и сделают проще и удобнее, я еще долго после 1 части не мог отвыкнуть от предложенного набора клавиш или кнопок гейпада. Данная часть это начало увлекательной истории, к сожалению после 3 части франшиза не сможет поддержать далее тот уровень рассказа, который начали разработчики в этой части. Многие игроки еще долго не смогут принять другого протагониста в последующих частях, хотя наиболлее популярным считается герой 2 части Эцио, герой 1 части всегда будет первым. Ждем и надеемся что серия вернется к истокам и перестанет быть конвеером.			"

												Assassin's Creed does deserve to be acclaimed for its contributions to the stealth genre. From it's innovative exploration of environments, including the addition of parkour and tiered levels, to the simplicity and immediacy of it's control system (even if Altair sometimes runs into the wall rather than UP them!) Not only this but it's excellent for it's explorations of philosophy (albeit rather simply) and conflict of religion, by chosing the era of the Crusades, something it handled rather one sidedly (Christian's were very obviously evil, but did at least question the morality of the Assassin's and the protagonist himself). In fact Altair is still one of the most memorable of the characters from the series, progressing from self-confident, narcissistic fool to more mature and conscientious assassin. Unfortunately the game did interrupt this progression with the annoying sci-fi sequences inbetween where we encounter Desmond, however I suppose he does form a viable narrative link to Ezio in the future games, so this annoyance can be somewhat overlooked...It's still a good, easy game to play even now, with a narrative that will remain as timeless as a Dan Brown novel.

												Assassin's Creed is a great example of a development studio taking a risk and having it pay off. With it's pioneering of the puppet control system for third person ""platformers"" and the use of free-running (which later in 2009 spurred Mirror's Edge). Assassin's Creed has a basic flow. You get a mission in one of five regions, you arrive, you do all the pre-requisite ""open world"" missions to prepare (such as surveying the area from a perch and stealing valuable information that you can use to better approach the target), then you start the actual assassination.While others seemed to get annoyed with the preperation phase, I didn't mind it so much as it helped push the sense of how preparation was key for things like this, though some variety wouldn't have hurt.While Assassin's Creed requires a dual-core procesessor, it does perform quite well on anything that meets the minimum requirements. Unlike most console ports, the frames are smooth and the details are much better.			"

												Pros:Graphics:Having come out as early as in 2007, it has aged really well. It's easy to mistake it for a game of 2015.  Gameplay:+ The mechanics were smooth and natural, creating a realistic flow of movements.+ The climbing system is supreme. + The fighting was very enjoyable both because of the kill moves and the crowd control. You learn new moves throughout the game as you progress but unfortunately you don't really need to put them in practice until the very end when you have to fight off some 25+ guys at once. Then all of a sudden you can't do without learning the moves. Personally I would also have preferred a more offensive character, the crowd control is built on holding your ground and waiting for the enemy's move. + Open world+ The fact that Assassin's Creed is a stealth game without the 'sneak' or 'crouch' option is interesting to consider.Cons:- The difficulty could have been better balanced. Three quarters of the game was just leisure, supereasy, then came missions that were irritating and the final battles were superhard. The irritating part involved begging women blocking your way, madmen pushing you around when you least wanted them to and guard chases that were just the same as in the beginning. After a 100th time they were just distracting game elements that you kind of had to grind through without feeling rewarded for it.- The missions were quite repetative which made the story linear. I felt like the game didn't take full advantage of the open world possibilites. - I didn't feel motivated to collect all the flags because there were way too many of them and I didn't see any reward behind it.- I never understood the necessaty of the fixed camera positions in the bureau scenes.- Did encounter a few glitches like character getting stuck in weird places, occasional frame rate drops but nothing game-breaking. The biggest issue was probably the game not responding to keystrokes at times, especially when initializing run or sprint.- Exiting the game was a weird lengthy process. The easiest solution was to just force quit it.			"

												Starter of the franchise and as such navigation and side quests lack behind the second part. Positive though, that it isn't divided into a million sub-levels like with AC2 . Also, it is historically closest to reality and thus in this sense the most interesting part. Weapons are quite basic, compared to the other AC's, but the graphics are still enjoyable besides it's age, though cannot compete with the latest sequels.Of course, forget about the Animus gibberish and the 21st Century story (nobody needed it anyway) which acts as a mere distraction and bear in mind that this game is far more repetitive than the follow-up ones. As well, I found some earlier missions harder due to the lack of equipment than later ones.I still give it a plus and recommend the series in generell, if you liked the Batman franchise or just love medivian costumes.

												A very difficult recommendation because the game is falling apart at it's seams on newer hardware, but it's still a recommendation none the less.  It's a very fun game, it has a decent story, Altiar seems very bland from his monotoned voice and you don't really see his face much under the hood, but he has extremely good dialogue and character development.  It hasn't aged well, it was extremely innovative for it's time, however, we've seen these innovations recycled ever since and done better making the game's world just feel extremely dated.  Also, while the futuristic parts of the game can be quite interesting, they're kinda shoehorned in the game worst than any other entry in the series, or at least before ACIV, especially with the ending.

												The way I see this game: Cons: ( I prefer to leave Pros last )You are one of the gamers that wants to complete this game 100%? If you are, it may get boring for you and I will explain why. As others have said before me you just have to climb specific towers or buildings to unlock an area of the map usually between 9-11 in every assassination. Then you have to interrogate a person, pickpocket another one, eavesdrop yet another, gother some flags in under 3 mins or kill some guards in 3-5 mins. You will be assigned with 9 assassinations in total which for me the whole proccess is as described by others REPETITIVE. BUTPros:I really liked the story, even though it was short it was intelligently written. The gameplay for me it wasn't boring because in every assassination you unlock new moves which keeps you wanting for more. You are able to kill any guard or citizen you want ( even though you instantly lose life when you kill a citizen ) and of course you have to face the consequences.Overall for me it's a great game worth playing and I recommend it to anyone that loves action games.

												It's Buggy, controls can be awkward when you first play, there are an excess of menus, and missions can be fustrating and annoying by how they are designed, yet inspite of all of this, the game managed to captivate my attenion and keep me coming back for more.It has an alluring atmosphere, intresting characters, and an alright story. The voices can be a bit bland, the ending is a little weak, and the Desmond scenes feel like an abrupt stop sign, but overall the story still works.This is my personal favorite of the Assassin's Creed Series. This is the original Assassin's Creed, and despite what some may think about more recent installments in the series, this game still delivers the experience that made the series so popular.There is a high resolution fan mod I would recommend with this, you can find it in the guide section for this game.

												7.5/10. (tl;dr at bottom)While that might not be exactly a breathtaking score, you will get 20-30 hours of gameplay out of this bad boy if you take your time and allow yourself to be immersed into the world, which I think makes it worth the price tag. When it first came out, everybody in the right mind knew that this was a good first step for Ubisoft's new IP. I owned the Platinum Edition of the game on Xbox 360 (which had fixed almost all the bugs and glitches) and I must say that it is easily one of my favorite single-player games of all time. Collected every flag, slayed every Templar, and unlocked every achievement. So to play it again on PC was nostalgic to say the least.-Pros-1. A rich and immersive story that has never been done before. That is, if you can look past the repetitive nature through which it is told (more on that later). You can see a lot of things being set-up, and with the help of the setting it takes place in, you might just find yourself doing what I did. Which was looking up stuff about the real life Hashashin and Templar Order, and researching the Crusades and places within the game, which they did a stunning job of recreating, especially for when the game came out. Their alternate take on history is crazy-cool, but the only way to truly do it justice is by playing it for yourself.2. Stealth works quite well, although it is significantly improved upon in later editions of the game. Blending in with the masses or groups of scholars fits and is quite seamless. As things progress the city guards are on higher alert, and you'll notice more of them on the streets, and also that there are more elite guards on the look out for the infidel. They provide a fair challenge until you get a grip of the combat (which is fairly basic), and that's good because Altair is supposed to be a total badass anyway, and a master swordsman. This allows for three primary different playstyles: stealth, open combat, or a mixture of those two.3. Another major thing to mention is the climbing works well. It is what gave that magical feel to this game when you play it for the first time. An open world where I can scale buildings and run through the streets of these beautifully crafted locales using parkour? Honestly made me want to go do it in real life. And some people did, just check YouTube! This is another mechanic that was trademark of the AC series, and only got better for the most part with each new installment. For its time though the system was awe inspiring, and fit the nature of the game perfectly, allowing you to truly bring out your inner assassin.-Cons-1. I won't spoil anything actually important, or something that would ruin the story. The story and lore is great. But the gameplay that tells it... repetitive. For me, a kid who played Mercenary: Playground of Destruction several times over, this wasn't much of a problem. It was easy to look past this and appreciate it from an artistic standpoint. Still, it must be mentioned, and if you ask anybody, this is probably one of the biggest gripes on Assassin's Creed I.2. While the Director's Cut and Platinum editions fixed a lot of stuff, the game can still be buggy as hell. I *DO NOT*... repeat, do not recommend this game if it is not compatible with your PC. Like me, you'll run into occasional crashes (the game has a great autosave system though), outright unobtainable and missing flags or Templars if you want to 100% the game like I did on the 360, and simply hilarious! glitches with guards dead bodies and even Altair. Annoyingly, sometimes when performing a Leap of Faith, he'll go through the entire animation and everything only to oddly bounce off the haybale at the bottom, sometimes resulting in your death. Nothing you can do about it, although it seems to only happen in specific places.3. The game is not keyboard friendly at all. In fact, the controls aren't even described in-game for mouse and keyboard, saying things like ""Press the Head button to use Eagle Vision"" but you'll be screwing around for minutes trying to figure it out. I recommend a controller. However, this also has issues setting it up. Majority of people, including myself, had to do a quick internet search, download a patch to get the game to recognize the Xbox 360 PC controller properly. Even still, keyboard and mouse with the Assassin's Creed games just feels awkward and wrong. I recommend a controller, and spend the ~10-15 minutes fixing it if needed + learning the controls of the game. At least if you learn them now, you'll basically know how to play the rest of the series.4. The graphics did not quite withstand the test of time, but you shouldn't go into this game expecting anything like that. They were awesome for 2007 as far as I'm concerned, and hopefully you can look past those kinds of vain things to appreciate what lies beneath the surface. They're not terrible or anything, but lacking by today's standards... although, again, don't know why you would bother with such unfair comparison.---tl;dr is if it is compatable with your PC, buy it. More than likely, your computer will be 'too good to play the game'. Of course, if you don't mind dealing with occasional glitches and bugs, most of which are humorous but might detract from the immersion, go for it anyway. Your call. The story is fantastic, and you should definitely pick it up if you want to play and understand the following installments. Worth the money with plenty of content and mild replayability, and a definite gem of 2007 despite its repetitious nature.			"

IntroductionAfter completed it for the first time after years (the first one was at release), here's my reviewAC is overall a great game, considering the time it was released.Story(No Spoilers)There are 2 main characters, in 2 different timeframes.  Desmond Miles (present day) is captured by Abstergo Company and forced to re-live the memories of his ancestor Altair Ibn La'Ahad, through the Animus. Altair was a member of an Assassin Group in the Middle Ages. The game narrates Altair's life during the 3rd crusadeGame TimeApprox. 20 hours, maybe morePros+Cool sound effects that will satisfy everyone. Plus, pretty good soundtrack, hard to notice while playing, however.+Great graphics/shaders/models, considering the fact that the game was released in 07+Simple combat system, but still, the animations are awesome +As a fan of history, a concept i enjoyed.Cons-Graphics not that great, with some potentional glitches.-No replayabiliy. Few are the people who finished it more than once, most likely. It gets boring to do so.Concluding, totally worth buying. If you have no A.C. experience yet, start off here. Dont go straight on to the sequels, bypassing this. However, since you are probably not gonna complete it more than once, grab it on sale.8.0 / 10.01. Dont touch it even if it's on the house [0-3 / 10].2. If you are bored of every other game [3-5 / 10].3. Grab it whenever it's on sale (or pay the full price if you are wealthy enough) [6-8] 4. Must Have [9-10 / 10]			"

												Assassin's Creed is the first entry of the franchise and an unforgettable one.  Set during the third crusade, you play as Altair, an arrogant master assassin whose pride almost ruins his order.  He get's another chance to redeem himself and that's where you come in.  Here are the pros and cons:Positives:- Interesting Sandbox assassin game.- Excellent setting during the third crusade.- Inventive gameplay and different approaches to take down the targets.- Lively cities.- Bad♥♥♥♥♥protagonist.Negatives:- Extremely repetitive process: go to bureau, climb buildings to get sight of event points, solve events, get information, go to bureau, take down the target, run away, go back to the Mualim.- Desmond's story line is completely boring.- That ending...Verdict: A-			"

It has okay-ish gameplay that gets a bit too repetitive and tedious at times, because you basically do the same 5-6 missions over and over again.

												Game is divided in cities, each city has 3 zones, each zone has the same missions as the zone before. So yes, too repetitive. I mean, 20 hours of always doing the same thing; climb the towers to unlock missions (boring), save peasants by killing badmen, pickpoket, kill some, hit some and kill a boss for each zone. Too repetitive. The best part is the very end, which leaves a intriguing plot for the sequels. The out-of-animus gameplay is very, very, (let me stress that word once more) VERY boring.Difficulty comes in numbers. Though there are different leveled warriors, the battle-system is too simple. Always defend and when an opponent attacks, counterattack them, you'll always win. I've died few times, most of them because I fell to the water.  Apparently, Altair knows the killing but not the swimming. Nice assassin.So, if you have money on Steam sales and time to waste, buy it. But I still don't understand all the fame/hype the game has. I hope the sequels are better.			"

Three Reviews for Three DemographicsFor the ApatheticFor the Obtuse& For the MeticulousFor the Apathetic; Assassin’s Creed is a massively annoying, yet intriguing, third person action/adventure game that is worth purchasing because simply, the good outweighs the bad. Its stunning environments, above average overall storyline, and cinematic bloody combat is worth the play through and experience even though there is a massive list of Irritating nuances to the supporting structures of the game, that no doubt most players will find regrettable. You may read further to see my own personal detailed review, but again, it’s fun to play despite the annoyances. For the Obtuse; Stab, Stab, Stab, Cool Knife, Pretty Girl, Computer Simulator, Stab, Stab, Past History, Old Doctor, Stab, Stab, Stab, Repetitive Side Quest, Climb a Tower, Climb a Tower, Climb a Tower, Repetitive Side Quest, Repetitive Side Quest, Repetitive Side Quest, Repetitive Side Quest, Repetitive Side Quest, Repetitive Side Quest, Repetitive Side Quest, Repetitive Side Quest, Stab, Stab, Stab, Steal a Pen, Get a New Sword, Climb a Tower, Awesome Story Twist, Learn to Counter, Win.For the Meticulous; I went headfirst into this review thinking I would tear this game apart. The trending attitude right now is to bash on the Assassin’s Creed franchise because of the abysmal development of Unity. Ubisoft, the parent company, has also exhibited incredible stubbornness in not actually changing the game’s core mechanics and trying to venture forth into newer more lively territory, like most fans have wanted. They literally just keep chucking repetitive gameplay at us, like we are idiotic plebeians. We’ve essentially come at an impasse where releases for such a popular annual game series is being halted, delayed, and brought back to the drawing board because of these unfortunate dilemmas. This is why I decided to go back to the original game in the series, to play it all the way through. I wanted to open my eyes and see the entertainment value originally, as it truly was supposed to be, before throwing my personal opinions into the ocean of voices on the internet. My personal experience with the series has been playthroughs of both Assassins Creed 3 and 4. However, I never played the beginning game all the way from A to Zed, the one that started it all. I brashly thought and knew, that by the end of my journey through the mind of Desmond and Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, I would come to the conclusion that the eternal fight between Templar and Assassin was flawed from the beginning, I was mostly wrong… http://angryjellyfishs.livejournal.com/Go here if you want to read the full Meticulous review.

												The one that started it all. I've played through AC1 - Revelations on consoles and have decided to revisit AC1 - AC3 and eventually the rest on PC with 100% completion.There are two mind sets I would review this game in; 1. Completing purely for the story and background. 2. Completely the game 100% (All collectibles and missions etc..).If you're more of a number 1. then by all means purchase this game and enjoy the backstory to the others and if you're like me then play the rest. The only real downside the completing the game like this is sometimes the parkour movement will seem clunky especially late game. I won't spoil when I started getting frustrated with it. However if you're the wanting to full clear this game with all collectibles found and all missions completed then you may or may not want to skip this one depending on your patience. Problem 1. As I said the parkour in this game can be clunky if you're not going straight forward. As can be expected it's only the first in the series.Problem 2. The side missions are very repetitive. You will essentially have a cookie cutter copy of missions through each district in the game (a total of 9). The only thing changing will be the final assassination.Problem 3. Since I had decided to do a full completion run I found myself constantly Shift+Tabbing to a steam guide for all the locations. Now for some reason this game does not take that too kindly and if you remain in the Shift+Tab state for too long the game will simply crash. I have tried to numerous fixes I could find but not of them stopped the problem entirely. Thank fully AC1 auto saves after every collectible pick up so I never lost data. Just patience. If you are going to go for 100% completion make sure you have Vertical Sync ON for the ruins in the kingdom. As one of the jumps in which you will need to ledge grab for a flag is impossible without this setting! You will know it when you see it.Now for just general gameplay:Problem 4. Speaking of the final assassinations (don't worry no spoilers here). I found that most of them cannot be ""stealth"" killed. Now I don't entirely remember if the following games have improved on this to allow the player to stealth or styalise their final kills but in the first game it is essentially find the target, kill all the guards and then kill the target.TL;DRThis is a great game for the first in its series and I highly recommend it for pure story playthroughs. If you are willing to go through 25+ hours and occassional crashes + clunky parkour at times then it will also be great for a full completion (all collectibles / missions). Enjoy and Happy Assassinating! "

												The game was released 7 years ago, and my interest has always been big, although other games always end up being purchased first. This year I finally bought tne entire AC Series, and of course, started by the first (even with all AC II fame).I regret to have taken so long to buy the game.Even on 2014, Assassin's Creed has a huge counter weight when compared to newer games, with more advanced technologies and more detailed graphics. With a unique artistic production and game system, you initially see yourself stuck to climb buildings all the time. Then you begin to sink into the story, and your bind with Altaïr only grows.You watch an assassin make his path to redemption and, along with him, begins to wonder about the course of history, and if what you are asked to do is really the right thing.The combat system is initially somewhat confusing. The complexity of it, however, is quickly outmaneuvered as you progress in the game, it even becomes a little boring and instinctive. Still, when confronted by multiple enemies, a wrong move can cost a lot. And if you need to flee, the adrenaline is guaranteed (specially with the amazing soundtrack).Definitely I'm not disappointed with any aspect of the game (a little with the combat system that gets a bit boring along the way). But the story makes it completely worth it. Ubisoft made a game worth every minute of playing.			"

												A very good game, though not in my top list by any means. Had some great gameplay elements but was repetative enough to lose it's charm before the end. Combat was smooth and well executed, though I prefer a style that doesn't rely so much on timing and simply learning specific enemies' moves. The open world was very well executed and clambering around the cities never really got old, which says a lot for the game. The really repetative part though was the missions. There were only 3 or 4 mission styles that could each be executed in the same manner and I found myself losing track of which mission I was on simply because they were that similar.The other games in the series improved upon the failings of the first though, so if you want to play those, it would be worth playing the first just to get the storyline.

												I finally finished the game, overall I thought the game was really good. Good story line, awesome parkouring and assassinations. Great graphics for a game made in 2009, the setting of the Third Crusade is really interesting, must play if you're a fan of that kind of setting. I finished most of the challenges and climbed all the view points, except for getting all 500 flags.So if you're new to the game and is interested in it, beware, the gameplay is REALLY repetitive. You're pretty much doing the same thing for 70% of the game. The storyline makes up for it even though I didn't catch the dialogue sometimes, Ubisoft really should have included a subtitles option. Overall, the game is definitely worth playing if you're interested in the AC franchise, people may tell you to skip to the sequel but I like playing games in chronological order, especially in a franchise. I bought this game on a summer sale and it was worth every penny.			"

												The original Assassin's Creed is a great game for it's time. It has a lot of excellent elements (jumping off tall buildings, climbing buildings, etc.) that made it feel fun. However, the game definitely shows its age. The graphics and game play (particularly some of the climbing controls) can be dated and/or frustrating at times. In addition, I noticed quite a few clipping and other strange bugs during taller climbs and some of the fights I had.But, as the original epsiode of an excellent series, it definitely is wroth one playthrough.

												Some good ideas and an all round decent game. The cities were designed very well and allowed great freedom when free-running. The mechanics of this worked well also. The story was a bit convoluted and got repetitive as it made you visit the same places and do similar tasks quite often, Repetition was probably my biggest complaint overall in the game. Combat is fun but can become boring and disinteresting. The graphics have held well and the game still looks and feels aesthetically pleasing. Had a few bugs but nothing major.

												This is a recommendation with a caveat.Assassin's creed gave the feeling of King's Quest, Prince of Persia, and Thief mixed in with an interesting storyline and compelling gameplay.The caveat is that the game has three parts that are essentially straight up repeats of the previous, just with more story progression. Each city is the same round of tasks after the first.That said, the story is decently written and gameplay fun enough that playing through the game is worthwhile.It's also a great start for the even better sequel.

												Assassin's Creed is a great game to play, no doubt about it. It also has amazing graphics for it's time and age which is a really great thing. In this review I'm going to be letting you know about the good and the bad for this game, (although it's generally good and I would highly reccomend).Something that I thought was great about this game is that it wasn't one of them horrible console to PC ports with horrible controls. It worked absolutely fine, and though I haven't, I'm sure it would also work great with a controller. Now, that aside, the general controls for the game were... let's say interesting. This is not because of it being a port, but part of the storyline. Basically you complete the levels in the Anamus and are reliving your ancestors memories. You have to be completely in sync with what they did, therefore as you are playing through their memories, the controls are a bit weird. For instance, you can't simply press the space bar to jump, you need to press 'W', the right mouse button and then the SPACE bar. There are many other examples aside from that too.The storyline for this game is absolutely amazing. You start of as a reckless assassin, ignoring the clear rules of the assassin code, therefore having your rank stripped of you. To regain your rank, the assassin leader, Al Mualim, requests for you to kill 9 'corrupt' leaders in different cities. Around the cities you learn more evidence about whatever plot or plan the leader's are planning, eventually you kill the leaders ect. The end of the game has a very dark twist, and I'm not going to tell you, because that would be spoilers but if you play the game with no knowledge of it, such as I did, it will be quite a shock. The game also has quite a good storyline outside of the Anamus, as you have been kidnapped by modern day Templars who are using your ancestors memories to locate the other Apple of Eden's scattered across the world.The gameplay for this game was generally good, but it could get quite clonky at times when trying to face more than 10 other enemies at a time especially if they are templars or highly suspicious guards. The game was also pretty repetitive as every time you entered a city you have to complete 3 investigations, such as earsdropping, stealing, interrigation and more. When finally facing the target things become less repetitive as each target has something different up their sleave leaving things to get more and more difficult.Overall I really enjoyed this game and would highly reccomend it. I would rate this game an 8/10.			"

												An ""okay"" game I suppose. It's repetitive, the story is bland, the sound-quality for the citizens are horrible and the main-character is boring. I would not recommend the game for those who isn't familiar of the franchise, but for those who have played the other games first. Because this is not how you want to be introduced into the seires.I'll give it an 6/10.			"

												Classic game. If you're new to the series then this game is very fun. However that fun dies out after a while as you just repeat the same missions over and over again. The best part of the game is free-running and the actual assassinations. The setting in the Crusades is pretty cool and the world is well-rendered. Other than that, the game is quite mediocre. The story is okay.  It definitely has its cool moments though so buy it if it's on sale. Assassin's Creed II makes references to this game so I'd recommend playing this before the 2nd one, but it's not necessary if you just want to enjoy the gameplay.			"

												While not as refined as latest games in the franchise, Assassin's Creed manages very well to deliver a good amount of action and stealthiness (Unfortunately, something that is getting behind in latest AC games), our hero is Altaïr, an assassin, loyal to the order and master assassin at a young age, who carries out the assassinations ordered by his mentor. 1191 is the time, the Third Crusade is devastating the land and we have 9 targets to terminate, as well as to find a rare artifact capable of magical powers. During the game we will have to learn all sort of abilities that will help us fight the enemy and avoid danger by using stealth skills, though, this is one of the game's main characteristics, sometimes it feels painful to learn or they just don't feel satisfying. The game tends to suffer from a serious case of  consolities , but in the end, once you manage to learn all the skills and keys that do x movement, you will be ok. On AC, it's the first time we face tail missions, something that feels really good here, but that due to its repetitiveness felt annoying on the next AC games. Even the stealthy missions were cool and delivered a good result in the end.Also, a positive point of the game is its locations and historical events occurring while we carry out our assassinations. All cities and the Holy Land are depicted in good manner and you feel the tension between the two important religions there, another point in favor are the historical characters involved in the conspiracies and actions we see and hear of during our missions. Maybe something I already feel sick of  are the collectibles. There are hundreds of them all over the places we visit, the good thing is we are not forced to collect them, but still manages to distract me, this is because they appear in every AC game! I hope they get rid of them once and for all.Updated: While replaying AC once again, I started paying attention to the camera angles and movements, firstly, the camera is really jerky and awkward preventing me from contuining my journey after liberating civilians or helping people in distress, this happened everytime I acted this way making the fluidity of the game a terrible experience at times. On a side note, kudos for an almost bug free game, I barely met any glitches around, something I am grateful for!I totally recommend this game for people that feel hesitant whether they should pick this game or that want to try the franchise, it is a fun, kind of a repetitive game, but that delivers an interesting concept about history, religion and characters and of course an appealing fictional storyline.

The story is interesting, the game play length is great, no short 4 hour stuff that you see from other games. I havn't tried a speed run, but the game is way too beautiful to waste on a speed run.

												Don't let the low playtime (as of this writing at least) fool you, I've spent a lot of time with this game on other platforms.The first Assassin's Creed game, while still a good game as the thumbs up can carry, is honestly inferior to the sequels in quite a few ways.The game itself is repetitive and frustrating at times, the campaign essentially consisting of three or four mini-quests in new locations you can complete all of or some of for the same reward before an assassination ni one of threecities. This is repeated many times with roughly the same conersation taking place at each turn and only slightly more exposition offered. This brings in pacing problems (admittedly present in most AC games) in that the story moves quickly at the beginning, slowly for around 10 or so hours of gameplay, and then moves into the endgame of Altair's story like a runaway train while Desmond's story builds up to reveals (and ultimately letdowns) in the future games.In summary:Fun mechanics in an open world that have been improved in future gamesInteresting story with some pacing problemUnfortunately repetitive campaign.Final verdict: Probably buy it on sale. <10$ or so, but it's a good game.

												Assassins Creed is one of the most well know Action/Adventure series to date, and rightfully so! I have always been a big fan of Assassin Creed, and owned all the collectors editions on my Xbox, but as I transitions to PC, I really missed Assassins Creed. AC really kickstarted my gaming hobby, and now that it has finally been released to PC, I am more than happy to say it made a smooth transition, with slightly better graphics than on consoles! Director's Cut is not much different than the original game, but is still a respectable port to the PC. I cannot say much about the graphics as they are very outdated by todays standards, but keeping in mind this assassins creed is over 6 years old! Gameplay feels fast paced, challenging, and smooth! Story is pretty basic, and the entire game is basically repeating the same 3 primary missions, over and over again. The whole climb everywhere feature is amazing, and still beats most games to date! I love that we finally got a PC version of Assassins Creed, because it's an outstanding series!Concept: Honestly very basic, the storyline is very repetitive, following one basic task to the next. 75/100Graphics: For its time, it's outstanding, everything has a suprising ammount of detail, and is very respectable. 90/100Sound: Sounds effects are great, but the overall soundtrack is very boring, and feels like it was left to the last second while in development. 75/100Playability: Using a keyboard and mouse feels great and was very well implimented! Combat is smooth and entertaining, and climbing up buildings feels great! 95/100Entertainment: Concept is basic, storyline is basic, campaigne is bare-bones, but the amazing gameplay and graphics really boost Assassins Creed: Director's Cut. 75/100Replay Value: Moderatly low.Overall Score: 82/100			"

												So here it is. The first, the one that started it all...and it's ongoing yearly (Or so) sequels and add ons. Short at sweet....for me one of the most overrated games EVER!....BUT, I will say that its actually quite fun and has a damn lot of atmosphere. It's the Batman Arkham assylum before there was one. Unfortunately, there's this huge open world which goes to waste, for the most part you go looking for flags and stuff....to what ends? Just to collect things with no reward?This is why the sequels did so much better. Regardless, the story  is great, graphics are rather nice, even for an 8 year old game and sets the stage for the sequel, which in my opinion was a much better use of open world. I'll still recommend this though.			"

												It took me a few tries before I actually played through Assassin’s Creed. (I think my fourth attempt, I actually stuck with it).It does not have the most intuitive control scheme, which makes it difficult to approach. However, if you stick with it, you can become familiar, and start moving around the world more fluidly. It may be frustrating at first, and require a conscious effort to put in the time to learn to play this game, but it is ultimately worth it.For gameplay, it is most satisfying if you can remove targets without causing a commotion. Learning how to do this can be difficult, but is very rewarding once you’ve mastered this art. Sometimes the boss fights just turn into large brawls, which is unfortunate. The final stretch seemed to involve very little stealth, and was just a bunch of large sword fights.The gameplay can become reparative, but the developers threw in side-quests to break things up.The over-arching story exists, but mostly you’ll be here for the moment-to-moment gameplay.

												Great 2006-7 action game,although not a RPG,it really has many features that make it look like it is.Story: is very interesting although it's a bit linear but it gives the player the chance to take his time to find out details about his/her missions.Graphics: very good,there are vast environments with huge cities and castles. Also the game includes a very good illustration of how Jerusalem looked like.On some interviews developers stated that they tried their best to create the maps to look exactly like how it was back then.No special effects of explotions or casting magic,its more the realistic kind of gaming. Music: fine,although they could have done something more epic than they did.Gameplay: simple fight system,gets boring after realizing you are repeating yourself over and over and over again.However there is a super awesome feature,building-climbing and freerunning.This will keep up your interest and help you enjoy yourself through the game for sure!

												Game is divided in cities, each city has 3 zones, each zone has the same missions as the zone before. So yes, too repetitive. I mean, 20 hours of always doing the same thing; climb the towers to unlock missions (boring), save peasants by killing badmen, pickpoket, kill some, hit some and kill a boss for each zone. Too repetitive. The best part is the very end, which leaves a intriguing plot for the sequels. The out-of-animus gameplay is very, very, (let me stress that word once more) VERY boring.Difficulty comes in numbers. Though there are different leveled warriors, the battle-system is too simple. Always defend and when an opponent attacks, counterattack them, you'll always win. I've died few times, most of them because I fell to the water.  Apparently, Altair knows the killing but not the swimming. Nice assassin.So, if you have money on Steam sales and time to waste, buy it. But I still don't understand all the fame/hype the game has. I hope the sequels are better.			"

												My favorite of the series.... :-)No, the gameplay isn't the greatest.  It's very repetitive in its mission format, combat, and even aesthetics.  AC2 greatly improved upon those aspects, absolutely.What the original Assassin's Creed has is a story, a journey for Altair and Desmond Miles.  Both are paths of discovery and debate, a testing of iron against philosophical iron.  As Altair questions the precepts of the Assassin's Order and Templars, Desmond learns more of how the conflict in the Crusades applies to him in the modern age.  The plot is beautifully and intelligently (for prose fiction) presented to the player in a way that reveals tidbits consistently, yet subtly.It's a shame none of its sequels have ever matched the caliber of moral discourse in this title.  However, for the presentation of the plot alone, with its twists and back-and-forths, along with a cliffhanger of epic proportions, Assassin's Creed is a game worth experiencing.			"

												The one that started the illustrious series from Ubi Montreal. There is a lot of good, but a decent amount of mundane to be found here. While the moment to moment gameplay is fun, free-running section can be spoiled by how the game registers the ledge you are aiming for. The graphics do the job at hand and still hold up in 2016. For the searchers there is a decent number of collectables to find. On the other hand, those wishing for well-paced story telling must look for a different game, as meaningful story bits are few and far between.Pros:+ parkour+ assassin’s arsenal+ city verticalityCons:- story pacing- the difficulty is modified by the number of enemies later onWho is this game for?Those wishing for a good price/time ratio in their games and lovers of parkour.

												The one that started it all. I've played through AC1 - Revelations on consoles and have decided to revisit AC1 - AC3 and eventually the rest on PC with 100% completion.There are two mind sets I would review this game in; 1. Completing purely for the story and background. 2. Completely the game 100% (All collectibles and missions etc..).If you're more of a number 1. then by all means purchase this game and enjoy the backstory to the others and if you're like me then play the rest. The only real downside the completing the game like this is sometimes the parkour movement will seem clunky especially late game. I won't spoil when I started getting frustrated with it. However if you're the wanting to full clear this game with all collectibles found and all missions completed then you may or may not want to skip this one depending on your patience. Problem 1. As I said the parkour in this game can be clunky if you're not going straight forward. As can be expected it's only the first in the series.Problem 2. The side missions are very repetitive. You will essentially have a cookie cutter copy of missions through each district in the game (a total of 9). The only thing changing will be the final assassination.Problem 3. Since I had decided to do a full completion run I found myself constantly Shift+Tabbing to a steam guide for all the locations. Now for some reason this game does not take that too kindly and if you remain in the Shift+Tab state for too long the game will simply crash. I have tried to numerous fixes I could find but not of them stopped the problem entirely. Thank fully AC1 auto saves after every collectible pick up so I never lost data. Just patience. If you are going to go for 100% completion make sure you have Vertical Sync ON for the ruins in the kingdom. As one of the jumps in which you will need to ledge grab for a flag is impossible without this setting! You will know it when you see it.Now for just general gameplay:Problem 4. Speaking of the final assassinations (don't worry no spoilers here). I found that most of them cannot be ""stealth"" killed. Now I don't entirely remember if the following games have improved on this to allow the player to stealth or styalise their final kills but in the first game it is essentially find the target, kill all the guards and then kill the target.TL;DRThis is a great game for the first in its series and I highly recommend it for pure story playthroughs. If you are willing to go through 25+ hours and occassional crashes + clunky parkour at times then it will also be great for a full completion (all collectibles / missions). Enjoy and Happy Assassinating! "

												Many gamers like to loathe the first Assassin's Creed game for a very specific reason: it's a repetitive title. The entirety of the gameplay consists in riding an horse near patrols of guards with a strict max velocity policy on very large distances, reaching a city, performing some side-quests which remain exactly identical till the end, gameplay-wise, and then, at last, performing your assassination. And off you go again.I'd say too it's something that can drive you away from the title. However, Assassin's Creed got two features that I was never able to find in the following sequels:1)The game really made me feel like an assassin, having to reach the target's town and gathering information before planning my move. Also, unlike Assassin's Creed II onwards, in the first title you are far from a killing machine: leave the scene and hide is always the best solution, here. Also, no economic or risiko mechanics: very interesting, I won't deny it, but not very fitting to a group of shadows which main purpose is to stealthy eliminate menaces to humanity2) Assassin's Creed spots very interesting villains in the Templars, who are mostly portraied as anti-villains and well intentioned extremists. Their final speeches are the main highlight of the game's plot, in my opinionSuffice to say, I really think Assassin's Creed the first is the only worthy game of the series this far, with Assassin's Creed III coming very close to give me the same feelings			"

												I just finished my second play-through of this game, my first being shortly after it came out. I stand by my opinion that this is a great game that is well worth playing.First, the game's flaw (and there is only one major flaw): the missions are unashamedly repetitive. If don't mind that, or mitigate it by performing only one or two assassinations per evening, then the game should be very enjoyable. If this is likely to be a huge issue for you, perhaps skip ahead to ACII instead, which has (almost) all the great elements of this game but with much more varied missions. AC has no game-breaking bugs for me, but minor bugs include bodies occasionally flipping through the air.Now for the reasons to play:  The plot: interesting, with multiple twists. The storytelling: primarily done through well-written cut-scenes. The soundtrack: a real pleasure to hear - I'm sitting here listening to it as I write this review. The combat: it has more depth than it might initially seem. Of course, you can just wait for them to attack and counter all the time, but it's far from the fastest or most effective way of fighting. Additionally, getting in the habit of dodging or disrupting the powerful spin attacks (they cannot be countered) is helpful for the later part of the game). The stealth system: well-executed.The voice acting varies in quality, but it is generally high (with the notable exception of Altair, unfortunately).Some people dislike the way you can fall of ledges when jumping to them: while this can be an issue in the early part of the game, once you relearn how to grab onto ledges it becomes simply an additional skill the game requires, making free running a little more challenging if you want to avoid falling to the ground.Overall, I strongly recommend this game as highly enjoyable stealth action game with a great story.

												Where it all began...The more recent Assassin's Creed titles may have better gameplay and graphics, but they lack storyline and completely disregard the original concept of the Assassins and their creed: to be discrete in all things. How can you expect to be discreet when weilding tens of weapons (including guns & explosives), having access to armies of assassins, and sailing pirate ships into combat... Almost feels like you're playing ""God of War"".The first episode of the series may be more difficult and less grandiose compared to the recent titles, and the gameplay may have aged a bit. But the storyline, dialogue and general ambiance definitely make up for it. Still my favorite Assassin's Creed.			"

												Want a game that has cool sword fighting and amazing stealth then look no further. Assassin's Creed 1 was and still is an amazing game to play. Basically the entire game is done in your mind by unlocking memories from your DNA.  Now after a certain point the game is the same where all it is is making sure you hit the button at the right time to counter and such. But still a must play game.			"

												Overall Rating: 7.5/10. Really excellent game storywise and a necessity if you plan to play through the Assassin's Creed franchise so you understand everything and a pretty damn amazing looking game for 2008, looks way better then most games from that era. Gameplay is fun for like 3-5 hours then this game is just too damn reptitive.In my opinion this game is still definitely worth getting just know going in that it's very repetitive but also short so it's not too bad, enjoy!

												Game: Assassin's CreedGenre: ActionDeveloper: UbisoftSystem: PCTotal Score: 84/100Value Score: 8.4/10• Story: 10/10o Assassin's Creed's storyline is very original and amazing like no other game. You originally play as Desmond Miles, who is a descendent of a order of Assassins who know a terrible secret that the company Abstergo who is secretly under the influence of the Templars is trying to find out. They kidnapped Desmond Miles to uncover the secrets left within the past through a machine called the Animus which allows a user to relive the past of his ancestor through manipulation of the genetics of a person. While inside the Animus the player will play as Altair who is the main assassin in the game, you will be forced to slay 9 evil men who hold the secret that the Templars are after and ultimately uncover the truth.• Characters: 7/10o Assassin's Creed's characters arent as colorful as other characters of other games, but they do seem to hold a interesting point of view considering the fact that most of the game takes place in steed of historical events. You will be playing as Altair who is pretty much a bad♥♥♥♥♥persona Assassin who thinks he can do anything but learns that he is far from perfection, he not only refines his skill as an assassin but refines his character, you will go through different trials and tribulations meeting a strange array of characters who at first seem oddly placed within the game but follow through the storyline's path. In terms of NPC characters, they are no different from what you would see in a typical GTA game.• GamePlay: 8/10o Assassin's Creed is pretty much action oriented but also dwells in stealth action. The game plays in a Sandbox type of style similar to GTA, you can easily travel around cities and certain locations. You can climb rooftops, buildings and towers. You can blend with people to cover your tracks or to get through certain obstacles. There are about 3 cities in which the game will mostly take place: Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre. Within each city, you must activate missions from the Assassin Bureau, find view points and activate them to see a wider area of the map. Rescuing citizens will allow you to find allies who will help you from pursuing soldiers. You can also do mini missions such as Race challenges, flag collecting challenges or escort missions. You mainly do interrogations and pickpocketing to advance in the storyline, once you complete at least 3 of the missions, you can head back to the Bureau to start the assassination mission where you will be forced to see a storyline scene involving the victim and surrounding characters, and then afterwards you must go for the kill and escape afterwards back to the Bureau without being under the watchful eye of the soldiers. There are about 7 memory blocks in total with each giving you about 1-3 assassination missions, you will also be able to converse with the two characters outside the Animus and read the messages. Once you complete a mission and return to the main city you originally started in, you will be upgraded with a new weapon feature or health meter. Throughout the game's view points, saving citizens and such , you will be awarded a DNA sync point, when it gets to the maxed which is 15, your Sync health meter will increase.• Graphics: 8/10o Assassin's Creed was released right around the time when the current gen was starting, due to the fact it was in design between the two generations, you can see a mixture of the two generations within the game. Some say it looks like it should of been released on the Xbox and PS2, while others welcome the release on the PS3 and Xbox360. However since we are reviewing the PC version, graphics wise it could differ depending on your graphics card. You will notice that NPC characters will have drawn faces similar to a GTA III style or something you would see in a WWE game. Only the main characters who play a major role in the game will actually have full fledged facial features. The game's environment at first may seem a bit bleak and bland, but it is necessary due to the storyline's dark tone and time.• Sound: 10/10o Assassin's Creed consists of several made noises, clashes and sound effects. You will notice a great detail of effects depending on your actions, from the grunting of your attacks to the final breath of your victims, from the clashing of swords towards the climbing of the buildings. This game contains alot of vocal acting, as many of the NPCs will talk about 90% of the time and there is barely any text for you to read unless they are instructions or messages you read off of the animus. The game also consists of amazing voice work as well which players will enjoy along with the revolving storyline.• Music: 7/10o Assassin's Creed music isnt as vibrant as most games, one can say its similar in number of tracks as a typical Resident Evil game. The music within the game consists of several orchestral dramatic tones which players will gain a beat of suspense when they hear the song playing during a duel or a battle. Much of the music is calm as well depending on what you were doing whether it was an assassination or escaping from pursuing soldiers. Music isnt really a strong point as you would need all the silence you can get from background to see what and who you are facing as a obstacle within a mission.• Length: 6/10o Assassin's Creed is divided into memory blocks, there are about 7 in total, some of them consists of you killing 1, 2 or 3 targets before progressing through another. You will be going back and forth towards many of the areas of the three major cities, and depending on which block you are, some areas will be restricted or changed. Assassin's Creed should take you at least 20-25 hours to finish the main storyline, however more can be achieved if you are bent on collecting flags and completing all of the missions, view points and the rescue of citizens.• Replay Value: 8/10o Assassin's Creed's main weakness would be its replay value, as you wont get much from replaying the game nor do you unlock any special level or ability. You can go back and attempt older missions and memory blocks, but there's nothing more to that.• Player Value: 10/10o Assassin's Creed is an enjoyable new game where people who are fond of conspiracies will surely enjoy the amazing storyline with a twist. Players will also enjoy the amazing unique gameplay and the different views of places which are based upon actual real life locations. Any person who is a fan of Action, stealth or sandbox games will surely love this game and will be glad to add it to their collection.			"

												The original Assassin's Creed is a great game for it's time. It has a lot of excellent elements (jumping off tall buildings, climbing buildings, etc.) that made it feel fun. However, the game definitely shows its age. The graphics and game play (particularly some of the climbing controls) can be dated and/or frustrating at times. In addition, I noticed quite a few clipping and other strange bugs during taller climbs and some of the fights I had.But, as the original epsiode of an excellent series, it definitely is wroth one playthrough.

												A very good game, though not in my top list by any means. Had some great gameplay elements but was repetative enough to lose it's charm before the end. Combat was smooth and well executed, though I prefer a style that doesn't rely so much on timing and simply learning specific enemies' moves. The open world was very well executed and clambering around the cities never really got old, which says a lot for the game. The really repetative part though was the missions. There were only 3 or 4 mission styles that could each be executed in the same manner and I found myself losing track of which mission I was on simply because they were that similar.The other games in the series improved upon the failings of the first though, so if you want to play those, it would be worth playing the first just to get the storyline.

												Well, I've been warned that this is the most dull entry in the saga.There's repetition in the ""quests"" you'll have to undertake - but most of them are optional and may be avoided. (You may not want to avoid them in the beginning, because you'll benefit from them.)But the world! It's a fantastic place and the cities are a sight to behold.Also, even I, clumsy as I am, had a blast jumping, climbing and stalking through these scenes - this games makes you feel much more competent than you are, which adds a lot to the fun.The story has an interesting spin (you'll see right at the beginning).All in all very recommended. I'm looking forward to the other entries in this series.Here are some play tips (very mild spoilers):Don't try to collect all flags. This is seriously madness and not needed, unless you are unhealthily obsessed :-)You can skip ""save the citizens"" sidequests BUT every 15 finished sidequests (informer quests, view points scaled, citizens saved) your hit point increase by one and you may even gain extra abilities, which helps a lot. You max out at 20 (two bars), so plan accordingly.I'd always scale all view points. These discover side quests and reveal the map, which is helpful when fleeing or planing to strike.You don't need to do all informer quests (3 out of 6). The info gained is not that helpful either. But - see above.			"

												Game is divided in cities, each city has 3 zones, each zone has the same missions as the zone before. So yes, too repetitive. I mean, 20 hours of always doing the same thing; climb the towers to unlock missions (boring), save peasants by killing badmen, pickpoket, kill some, hit some and kill a boss for each zone. Too repetitive. The best part is the very end, which leaves a intriguing plot for the sequels. The out-of-animus gameplay is very, very, (let me stress that word once more) VERY boring.Difficulty comes in numbers. Though there are different leveled warriors, the battle-system is too simple. Always defend and when an opponent attacks, counterattack them, you'll always win. I've died few times, most of them because I fell to the water.  Apparently, Altair knows the killing but not the swimming. Nice assassin.So, if you have money on Steam sales and time to waste, buy it. But I still don't understand all the fame/hype the game has. I hope the sequels are better.			"

												I cannot believe I did not play the original Assassin's Creed until 2014.  I have to say that the hype is worth it.  The game is slightly repetitive but makes up for its minor shortcoming with a pleasing artstyle, engaging stealth gameplay, intuitive and smooth combat, and a sense of movement and animation that is still lacking in many games today.  I would wholeheartedly recommend Assassin's Creed even years after its original release.  Play the game with an Xbox Controller to get the most out of it.			"

Short at sweet....for me one of the most overrated games EVER!....BUT, I will say that its actually quite fun and has a damn lot of atmosphere. It's the Batman Arkham assylum before there was one. Unfortunately, there's this huge open world which goes to waste, for the most part you go looking for flags and stuff....to what ends? Just to collect things with no reward?This is why the sequels did so much better. Regardless, the story  is great, graphics are rather nice, even for an 8 year old game and sets the stage for the sequel, which in my opinion was a much better use of open world. I'll still recommend this though.			"

												Great 2006-7 action game,although not a RPG,it really has many features that make it look like it is.Story: is very interesting although it's a bit linear but it gives the player the chance to take his time to find out details about his/her missions.Graphics: very good,there are vast environments with huge cities and castles. Also the game includes a very good illustration of how Jerusalem looked like.On some interviews developers stated that they tried their best to create the maps to look exactly like how it was back then.No special effects of explotions or casting magic,its more the realistic kind of gaming. Music: fine,although they could have done something more epic than they did.Gameplay: simple fight system,gets boring after realizing you are repeating yourself over and over and over again.However there is a super awesome feature,building-climbing and freerunning.This will keep up your interest and help you enjoy yourself through the game for sure!

												Assassin's Creed is possibly one of the greatest games released in 2007. It's a sandbox nature game with remarkable visuals, sound effects and story, which is based on historical events and people. There are two overlaping stories in this game: Desmond Miles and Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, through machine called Animus. Within the Animus, Altaïr's memories reveal that he was attempting to stop Robert de Sablé from taking an artifact from a Solomons temple, but broke all three of the assassin brotherhood's tenets in the process. The brotherhood leader, Al Mualim, demotes Altaïr to the rank of novice, and assigns him the task of assassinating nine people, all of whom are Templars, to regain his former status. As Altaïr assassinate them one by one he realises something is wrong about this assignment and that these people somehow are connected. Overall pretty good story, The gameplay consist out a series of assassinations ordered by Al Mualim. To achieve this goal, you must travel from the Brotherhood's headquarters in Masyaf, across the terrain of the Holy Land known as the Kingdom to one of three cities Jerusalem, Acre, or Damascus to find the Brotherhood agent in that city. There, the agent, in addition to providing a safe house, gives the player minimal knowledge about the target, and requires them to perform additional ""recon"" missions before attempting the assassination. After completing each set of assassinations, the player is returned to the Brotherhood and rewarded with a better weapon and then given another set of targets, with the player free to select the order of certain targets.Overall it‘s pretty good game, worth your attention but it does have downsides. The bad: It‘s repetitive and does not provide much graphic options for high end pc, combat is clunky and sometimes feels awkward. The Good: Fun parkour mechanics, great story, huge sandbox world that feels alive, great soundtrack, many little details. 7/10			"

												Assassin's Creed is a great game to play, no doubt about it. It also has amazing graphics for it's time and age which is a really great thing. In this review I'm going to be letting you know about the good and the bad for this game, (although it's generally good and I would highly reccomend).Something that I thought was great about this game is that it wasn't one of them horrible console to PC ports with horrible controls. It worked absolutely fine, and though I haven't, I'm sure it would also work great with a controller. Now, that aside, the general controls for the game were... let's say interesting. This is not because of it being a port, but part of the storyline. Basically you complete the levels in the Anamus and are reliving your ancestors memories. You have to be completely in sync with what they did, therefore as you are playing through their memories, the controls are a bit weird. For instance, you can't simply press the space bar to jump, you need to press 'W', the right mouse button and then the SPACE bar. There are many other examples aside from that too.The storyline for this game is absolutely amazing. You start of as a reckless assassin, ignoring the clear rules of the assassin code, therefore having your rank stripped of you. To regain your rank, the assassin leader, Al Mualim, requests for you to kill 9 'corrupt' leaders in different cities. Around the cities you learn more evidence about whatever plot or plan the leader's are planning, eventually you kill the leaders ect. The end of the game has a very dark twist, and I'm not going to tell you, because that would be spoilers but if you play the game with no knowledge of it, such as I did, it will be quite a shock. The game also has quite a good storyline outside of the Anamus, as you have been kidnapped by modern day Templars who are using your ancestors memories to locate the other Apple of Eden's scattered across the world.The gameplay for this game was generally good, but it could get quite clonky at times when trying to face more than 10 other enemies at a time especially if they are templars or highly suspicious guards. The game was also pretty repetitive as every time you entered a city you have to complete 3 investigations, such as earsdropping, stealing, interrigation and more. When finally facing the target things become less repetitive as each target has something different up their sleave leaving things to get more and more difficult.Overall I really enjoyed this game and would highly reccomend it. I would rate this game an 8/10.			"

												I finally finished the game, overall I thought the game was really good. Good story line, awesome parkouring and assassinations. Great graphics for a game made in 2009, the setting of the Third Crusade is really interesting, must play if you're a fan of that kind of setting. I finished most of the challenges and climbed all the view points, except for getting all 500 flags.So if you're new to the game and is interested in it, beware, the gameplay is REALLY repetitive. You're pretty much doing the same thing for 70% of the game. The storyline makes up for it even though I didn't catch the dialogue sometimes, Ubisoft really should have included a subtitles option. Overall, the game is definitely worth playing if you're interested in the AC franchise, people may tell you to skip to the sequel but I like playing games in chronological order, especially in a franchise. I bought this game on a summer sale and it was worth every penny.			"

												This is a recommendation with a caveat.Assassin's creed gave the feeling of King's Quest, Prince of Persia, and Thief mixed in with an interesting storyline and compelling gameplay.The caveat is that the game has three parts that are essentially straight up repeats of the previous, just with more story progression. Each city is the same round of tasks after the first.That said, the story is decently written and gameplay fun enough that playing through the game is worthwhile.It's also a great start for the even better sequel.

												An ""okay"" game I suppose. It's repetitive, the story is bland, the sound-quality for the citizens are horrible and the main-character is boring. I would not recommend the game for those who isn't familiar of the franchise, but for those who have played the other games first. Because this is not how you want to be introduced into the seires.I'll give it an 6/10.			"

												Classic game. If you're new to the series then this game is very fun. However that fun dies out after a while as you just repeat the same missions over and over again. The best part of the game is free-running and the actual assassinations. The setting in the Crusades is pretty cool and the world is well-rendered. Other than that, the game is quite mediocre. The story is okay.  It definitely has its cool moments though so buy it if it's on sale. Assassin's Creed II makes references to this game so I'd recommend playing this before the 2nd one, but it's not necessary if you just want to enjoy the gameplay.			"

												While not as refined as latest games in the franchise, Assassin's Creed manages very well to deliver a good amount of action and stealthiness (Unfortunately, something that is getting behind in latest AC games), our hero is Altaïr, an assassin, loyal to the order and master assassin at a young age, who carries out the assassinations ordered by his mentor. 1191 is the time, the Third Crusade is devastating the land and we have 9 targets to terminate, as well as to find a rare artifact capable of magical powers. During the game we will have to learn all sort of abilities that will help us fight the enemy and avoid danger by using stealth skills, though, this is one of the game's main characteristics, sometimes it feels painful to learn or they just don't feel satisfying. The game tends to suffer from a serious case of  consolities , but in the end, once you manage to learn all the skills and keys that do x movement, you will be ok. On AC, it's the first time we face tail missions, something that feels really good here, but that due to its repetitiveness felt annoying on the next AC games. Even the stealthy missions were cool and delivered a good result in the end.Also, a positive point of the game is its locations and historical events occurring while we carry out our assassinations. All cities and the Holy Land are depicted in good manner and you feel the tension between the two important religions there, another point in favor are the historical characters involved in the conspiracies and actions we see and hear of during our missions. Maybe something I already feel sick of  are the collectibles. There are hundreds of them all over the places we visit, the good thing is we are not forced to collect them, but still manages to distract me, this is because they appear in every AC game! I hope they get rid of them once and for all.Updated: While replaying AC once again, I started paying attention to the camera angles and movements, firstly, the camera is really jerky and awkward preventing me from contuining my journey after liberating civilians or helping people in distress, this happened everytime I acted this way making the fluidity of the game a terrible experience at times. On a side note, kudos for an almost bug free game, I barely met any glitches around, something I am grateful for!I totally recommend this game for people that feel hesitant whether they should pick this game or that want to try the franchise, it is a fun, kind of a repetitive game, but that delivers an interesting concept about history, religion and characters and of course an appealing fictional storyline.

												My favorite of the series.... :-)No, the gameplay isn't the greatest.  It's very repetitive in its mission format, combat, and even aesthetics.  AC2 greatly improved upon those aspects, absolutely.What the original Assassin's Creed has is a story, a journey for Altair and Desmond Miles.  Both are paths of discovery and debate, a testing of iron against philosophical iron.  As Altair questions the precepts of the Assassin's Order and Templars, Desmond learns more of how the conflict in the Crusades applies to him in the modern age.  The plot is beautifully and intelligently (for prose fiction) presented to the player in a way that reveals tidbits consistently, yet subtly.It's a shame none of its sequels have ever matched the caliber of moral discourse in this title.  However, for the presentation of the plot alone, with its twists and back-and-forths, along with a cliffhanger of epic proportions, Assassin's Creed is a game worth experiencing.			"

												If you are new to the franchise I'd recommend starting with AC2, however if you are already a fan, this is definitely worth picking up during a sale. This is the root of the franchise and has repetitive missions and flaws, but I really enjoyed seeing the completely different setting and it also is the most realistic AC to date imo and the assassins are really ruthless which was neat to see for once.

												I just finished my second play-through of this game, my first being shortly after it came out. I stand by my opinion that this is a great game that is well worth playing.First, the game's flaw (and there is only one major flaw): the missions are unashamedly repetitive. If don't mind that, or mitigate it by performing only one or two assassinations per evening, then the game should be very enjoyable. If this is likely to be a huge issue for you, perhaps skip ahead to ACII instead, which has (almost) all the great elements of this game but with much more varied missions. AC has no game-breaking bugs for me, but minor bugs include bodies occasionally flipping through the air.Now for the reasons to play:  The plot: interesting, with multiple twists. The storytelling: primarily done through well-written cut-scenes. The soundtrack: a real pleasure to hear - I'm sitting here listening to it as I write this review. The combat: it has more depth than it might initially seem. Of course, you can just wait for them to attack and counter all the time, but it's far from the fastest or most effective way of fighting. Additionally, getting in the habit of dodging or disrupting the powerful spin attacks (they cannot be countered) is helpful for the later part of the game). The stealth system: well-executed.The voice acting varies in quality, but it is generally high (with the notable exception of Altair, unfortunately).Some people dislike the way you can fall of ledges when jumping to them: while this can be an issue in the early part of the game, once you relearn how to grab onto ledges it becomes simply an additional skill the game requires, making free running a little more challenging if you want to avoid falling to the ground.Overall, I strongly recommend this game as highly enjoyable stealth action game with a great story.

												So 9 years after release, I finally played my first Assassin's Creed game ever. I never knew what was it all about, except that there is an assassin that kills stuff. I was very pleasently surprised by the story and plot - something new for me that I didn't expect.One thing that I didn't like from start was how the character is controlled (I don't think it is very suitable for keyboard, ofc I can imagine this game was primarily made for consoles), but I got used to it after some time and had no further problem.Style of gameplay was something completely new for me as well, I loved the roof action and how the cities were designed - there had to be a ton of work in just designing the environment. After some time I think I became pretty good at moving on the roofs and it was very enjoyable. Even interaction with crowd was very well done except 2 things that kept♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off for the whole game: 1) the annoying begging women who at one point completely blocked you from moving and you had to push them - which caused me many many troubles considering there were alerted soldiers all around and these little ♥♥♥♥♥es just kept ruining my missions.2) the drunken dudes that were attacking and pushing you everytime you came close - one in time would be ok, but there were just too many of them.Some reviews criticize the monotony of game and that they got bored very fast - that was not my case. I was playing it continuously in the evenings for 1-2h/day max and I never got  bored. I enjoyed the continously increasing difficulty of combats, but to be honest I wasn't enjoying increasing difficulty of investigation missions - some of them were just ridiculous at the end.Overall I liked the game, the story and the gameplay mechanics and I will definitely continue with playing successors, but it's not the type of game I would play twice. Also I have met some bugs, but nothing game breaking.			"

												The one that started the illustrious series from Ubi Montreal. There is a lot of good, but a decent amount of mundane to be found here. While the moment to moment gameplay is fun, free-running section can be spoiled by how the game registers the ledge you are aiming for. The graphics do the job at hand and still hold up in 2016. For the searchers there is a decent number of collectables to find. On the other hand, those wishing for well-paced story telling must look for a different game, as meaningful story bits are few and far between.Pros:+ parkour+ assassin’s arsenal+ city verticalityCons:- story pacing- the difficulty is modified by the number of enemies later onWho is this game for?Those wishing for a good price/time ratio in their games and lovers of parkour.

												Assassin's Creed is the beginning of one of the greatest series of all time. The first game, telling the story of Master Assassin Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, is an engaging and entertaining, story rich, and unique adventure into a combination of action, adventure, parkour and stealth. The game sets up, perfectly of course, an extremely lengthy (and profitable, at that) series of 'historical' discourse between the Assassins Guild and the Templars, who struggle for ideological and political dominance over mankind. While the series is played backwards through a machine, The Animus, in this game, 'popping' in and out of Altaïr's world is not disrupted by the frequent 'snaps' to reality as Desmond Miles. The PC version of this game unfortunately, while hard to control for some, has frequent crash issues, which disrupts the aesthetic and immersion of the game (and savegames too). This game is not necessary to understand the Assassin's Creed series, but it sure does help, and the PC version is bearable.Score: 72/100			"

												Interesting title. Altair's story in the past is quite interesting, but the Desmond's story in the present works more like a backstory than anything else, works fine with other titles in the franchise, but is meaningless by itself. Altair as a character is... strange a little, but he turns from an unlikeable dummy to quite likeable merciless killer! Yeah, I did just say that, likeable merciless killer, that's jut how it is. The game has its key standing in the franchise and goes really well especially with Ezio's trilogy, which is, by the way, following right after this, neat!.Assassin's Creed is recommended by just 1 out of 10 templars, but don't worry, that guy was a traitor and the others.. well, they didn't make it, the hidden blade is damn sharp.

												Take 'Hitman' and 'Prince of Persia' with a hint of 'Deus Ex' conspirancy and a touch of Dan Brown's historical revisionnism and you get this series pilot. If the premisse of this anti-GTA is absolute genius, the gameplay is more casual and can get repetitive and somewhat contrived through the 9 hits you perform around Jerusalem, Damascus, Acre and etc... during the crusades. Still, this has bestseller written all over it's DNA and it's no wonder the series is one of the biggest videogame franchises of all time. This is where it all started with epic graphics (way in advance for 2007 this feels more like a 2012 release and you will need a powerful pc to run it well and get all the eye candy) and a strong storyline that opens the mysteries and sets the tone of the episodes to come.

It does have a very large repetiton factor, with exactly the same set of pre-assassination tasks to complete for each target. What I liked most about this game was is the way it made me question what was true, right and fair in the world. As Altair moves along his quest, he starts to change the way he looks at the world. This then translates into the games message.Overall, a solid game that took me 24 hours to 100%,  8/10			"

												Okay, I would like to start by saying that this game was nicely done considering its age and the captivating series it later became is just a plus. Even thought i do recommend it, I wanna talk about some issues i experienced on my own and state my own opinions. If you are interested in reading my issues, please read further on as i encourage it, however, if you do not care please only read the next 2 sentences. I recommend this game only to long-time fans of the Assassin's Creed Game Series, if you have played the newest ones and expect this one to be just like it, you're wrong. You can easily skip this game and be caught up story-wise in the 2nd game; there's no specific reason to play this game unless you're a huge fan because it isn't necessary. My Issues:1) I experienced no lagging frames issue despite hearing so much about it on the YouTube.2) I found the keyboard controls to be a bit too demanding to memorize and quite frankly uncomfortable on my hands, so i used a Gamepad. I had to set the commands and actions myself, so that was a bit of a chore.3) Now to the game's story istelf. It was a little too boring for my taste; i remember predicting the ending minutes after starting the game.4) I had another issue about how fast travel was not introduced until later on in the game, making it a chore to go from city to city on horseback and just punishing on foot.5) My biggest issue; no matter what you do or how inconspicous you are, the guards are always suspicious of you! Okay, i understand that you are dressed in Assassin robes, but come on, you literally get busted for no reason!6) Side missions should be completed before you assassinate the target in the city for full memory synchronization.7) 100% completion is not worth the hassle.Thanks for reading, hope i helped you make up your mind!

												Great game! You run around a BIG world killing people, some of who seem deserve it, but stabbing, slicing or throwing knives at them. As you play you skill list increases until you reach a virtual god level of invicability.Even though it's a little old now it still looks pretty damn good. I woudl say, after a whiel it does feel a little rinse and repeat, but pretty much all open world games do. There are also minor bugs that can bee kind of annoying (I talking about that stupid 'climb' a pebble when you need to running fool), but nothing that is really detrimental.It has a really fun parkour thing going on that makes you feel like you are being pretty damn awesome when infact you are really just pressing one button. Plus, when you get the counter skills you really can get a lot of fun out this game. This was infact the 3rd time I've played it and still enjoyed.			"

												For it's time, a groundbreaking game.  I really enjoyed it and have played through it 3 times now.  The last time modded out with updated graphics.  The storyline was the best part.  Some of the busy work isn't that bad since it was the first game in the series but they should have learned that gathering flags and feathers is a waste of time.  The following games improve on the story line but sadly they also continue the busy work side quests.  For people with OCD like me, this can be a nightmare because we want to complete the game in it's entirety.  If you can complete the mission without them, just ignore the side quests and go for story line.  It will be much more enjoyable.			"

												Best way to play this game, and all AC games for that matter is to pause and read about the historical background they are based on. Makes the the world more alive and the immersion more intense. As far as the game is concerned the gameplay and is a little clunky but it's a 2008 game. Graphics are holding out decently even to this day. Great way to learn more and get interested in the 3rd Crusade.			"

												So 9 years after release, I finally played my first Assassin's Creed game ever. I never knew what was it all about, except that there is an assassin that kills stuff. I was very pleasently surprised by the story and plot - something new for me that I didn't expect.One thing that I didn't like from start was how the character is controlled (I don't think it is very suitable for keyboard, ofc I can imagine this game was primarily made for consoles), but I got used to it after some time and had no further problem.Style of gameplay was something completely new for me as well, I loved the roof action and how the cities were designed - there had to be a ton of work in just designing the environment. After some time I think I became pretty good at moving on the roofs and it was very enjoyable. Even interaction with crowd was very well done except 2 things that kept♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off for the whole game: 1) the annoying begging women who at one point completely blocked you from moving and you had to push them - which caused me many many troubles considering there were alerted soldiers all around and these little ♥♥♥♥♥es just kept ruining my missions.2) the drunken dudes that were attacking and pushing you everytime you came close - one in time would be ok, but there were just too many of them.Some reviews criticize the monotony of game and that they got bored very fast - that was not my case. I was playing it continuously in the evenings for 1-2h/day max and I never got  bored. I enjoyed the continously increasing difficulty of combats, but to be honest I wasn't enjoying increasing difficulty of investigation missions - some of them were just ridiculous at the end.Overall I liked the game, the story and the gameplay mechanics and I will definitely continue with playing successors, but it's not the type of game I would play twice. Also I have met some bugs, but nothing game breaking.			"

												I first played this game in 2010 and at first I thought it was amazing, however now after 7 years I have some different opinions about the game. Lets start with the good points about the game:1. The story - The story line in assassins creed has to be one of the best in videogame histroy as the franchise has been successful from the debut in 2007 all the way to present day. If you pay attention to the dialogue you will find a griping story that continues across the other games. 2. The combat - The game has a very easy combat system to use with a veriaty of methods to kill your enemies, sometimes the counters are a little laggy but if your timing and reactions are good then you will have a fun time cutting down your enemies. 3. The graphics - The graphics in comparison to newer games are awful but for a game released in 2007 the graphics are quite good and work on a veriaty of systems without any type of glitchs or lag. Now lets look at the bad parts of assassins creed:1. The sounds - In general the sounds are great quality and have no problems but there is one sound I really dont like and thats the poor women that ask for ""just a few coins"" you seem to hear it nearly everywhere in the city at somepoint and it can drive you insane!2. Climbing - Unlike newer assassins creed titles the climbing in this game is very slow and sluggish. sometimes altiar just stands aimlessly on a wall whilst you mash your keys trying to make him move. If you think that when enemies are chasing you that you will just climb to get away forget it! It is nearly impossible to climb away from the guards.3. Guards - The guards can make the game fun at times but mostly they just get in the way, for example when you are doing a stealth mission such as assassination missions the guards will make it very hard for you to complete this type of mission. 4. Saving citizens - The game offers a little but not compulsory side quest where you save citizens from guards attacking them, this is very fun and you need to do it to achieve 100% sync in the game. The problem I have with this is that once you have killed all the guards the person you saved takes ages to finish talking (the things they say are the same for each type of character you save and irrelevent) and then after that the camera locks on to the people who will block guards for you (these people are unlocked over the city as you save more people) when you just want to climb away before more annoying guards arrive to attack you. OVERVIEW: In general I recommend assassins creed to anyone who is looking at buying it as it has to be one of my personal favourite games and is part of one of my favourite game franchises! The Bad points list does have more points than the good points list but if you read what I had to say then you will notice that the things in the bad points list are minor little things that are no issue to most people and all the things that make a game good are found in the good points list. It took me about 18 hours in total to complete the game with 100% synch and I enjoyed it as much as I did the first time I played it. So yes do buy this game!			"

												This is where the universe of Assassin's Creed began. Assassin's Creed is an enthralling, original game about old historical events, with a twist. In this game, you play as Desmond, an assassin in a clan of assassins, and your goal is to go into the past and discover who you are by observing your ancestors through the ""Animus"" as they participated in key historical events. The ancestor whose life you venture though in this game is Altair.What I really like about this game is all the history you can learn from it. This game has an entirely fictional story with an accurate, non-fictional, historical environment. Many of the locations you visit in this game are similar (obviously not exact) to their real life counter parts during the time period the game takes place in. There are also real buildings and people that were recreated in this game, and when you encounter them the game tells you some of the history behind them. Also, the parkour in this game is unique and more complex than that of any other game that came before it. It provides very fun gameplay and plays a major role in the game's story.What I dislike about this game is the side missions. They are all more like challenges and have practically no side story to them (that was probably intentional, but I still felt like they should have had some sort of side story). I think with something interesting to do in this game other than the main story missions, the game could have been a little better. That doesn't include the game's underlying story with Desmond, which I actually also found entertaining.If you love parkour, stealth, and/or a 1100 A.D. theme, this is the game for you. I recommend this game to anyone, and it gets an 8/10 from me.			"

												Finally, after so many years, I managed to play and finish Assassin's Creed. Quite repetitive gameplay yet very enjoyable. Reminds me of Mad Max. You basically keep doing same♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over again, yet it's somehow addictive and rewarding. I haven't found all the ""collectibles"" yet I finished all ""side"" activities out of all memory banks. Took me 13h of total gameplay to finish the game. I can honestly recommend the game. Despite time passed since original release, it's still worth checking, for the gameplay and for quite interesting story. :)			"

												Played this through on the Xbox 360. When I have time I will play it through again on PC. Loved the experience and the depth of the world. It's a shame that the series has become such a transparent cash cow. This title however, though said to be the 'worse' of the series for repetitive gameplay, is simple and effective, and doesn't have Ubisoft's draconian DRM. Unfortunately, it does suffer from a lack of optimisation which, if you can handle the inconsistency, still shouldn't deter a purchase, at significant discount.			"

												Arcade and repetitive, but this game also has nice open world cities, smooth choreography and the best horses in a game yet.  Graphics were good for their time. Like most ports, this is nearly ruined by consolitis: narrow FOV, too easy, non-persistent world, annoying AI respawns, and one of the worst menu systems ever. The save system is bad and there are no subtitles. I had occasional CTDs. A pity, because without all those flaws, this would be a great game. In the end its an ""OK"" game. The sequels are also ""OK"" in my opinion. Get it in a sale.			"

												No wonder the series is such a commercial success: without experience yet of it's sequels, the abilities, modes and challenges are encapturing and stunning even at the beninning of the seires. In playing the game you are given the task of fighting the enemy from the ground and rooftops, evading the city guard and for the sake of it roaming and purging anyone you see fit. What a game for it's money; alongside a level system ideal for its sandbox agenda, it's a one-of-a-kind starter that distunguishes itself from any genre of action-adventure stealth games that fall between the boarders of Hitman and Crysis (not surprising, therefore, that the Assassin's Creed empire has spread so easily).

												First off, I want to say that I will be reccomending AC - but only just. At it's time of release, it was a brave entry with its mix of free running and stealth based gameplay. It is immersive, and gives you a real feel of the history and geography of the third crusade. The graphics arent too bad for its age either. One of the main reasons I would play this is the story, as it provides alot of the starting canon for the rest of the franchise. Each assassination feels purposeful, and taking a life has a consequence. Some of the targets I developed a personal anger towards when learning of their deeds, which indicates the strength of the writing. However, for the good there must be bad. For a start, it runs badly. Freezes throughout loading menus and occasionally in game - often mid combat which is awkward. The investigations required for the assassinations are repetitive, and tend to turn the game a bit grindy when you are performing them. The combat for some reason I just cannot fathom. I appreciate not all blows would be blocked, but the counter system makes little sense in the type of attacks that can be blocked. It boils down to luck - or maybe I am missing something. Late in the game the number of enemies is honestly ridiculous, and when you are surrounded by enemies winning is nigh on impossible. It got to a point on a number of occasions when I rage quit and resolved to watch the remaining cut scenes online. The missions themselves are sometimes hit and miss, I can't tell you the number of times I fell in that damn harbour, I mean, an assassin that can't swim? Really? For all this however, it probably is worth playing. Just dont expect an odessey, I went out of my way to explore and got less than 20 hours. P.S. THE TOP ASSASSIN CAN'T SWIM? SERIOUSLY?			"

												Playing through Assassin's Creed Brotherhood a second time has inspired this review. That is a great game, but the ending of it is really rushed, and because ACB puts so much emphasis on advancing a story, the rushed ending really hurts the game. Assassin's Creed (1) gets criticism for being repetitive. But all AC games---and games in general---are repetitive. AC2, the pinnacle of the series, has a lot of stuff to do, but all of that stuff outside of story is centered on making money, which ultimately makes the game feel repetetive for repetition's sake since skills granted by money don't help your progression through the story (the most fun and straightforward way to finish AC2 is with your hidden blade, so all other purchased weapons are peripheral). In AC1, repetitiveness arises from the structure of the game. There are three cities, each with three different districts. You have to complete about five (or six, if you include the vantage points) different kinds of missions to advance the plot and unlock new territories (whereas the feeling in subsequent AC games is that story unlocks new areas). One question then becomes: is the repetition of the structure of AC1 too simplistic? For me, the answer is no, because the variety of settings, combined with the challenge of stealth (it is harder in this one) makes AC1's repetition more complex than AC2's wait for a timer to increase my florins. (Fortunately, AC2 relies more on story to keep you playing.)So the next question is: if story can make repetitive gameplay satisfying, is the story of AC1 good enough? AC2 has AC1 beat by a country mile in story. The anthology/Dickensian approch used to tell Ezio's tale compelling. But AC1's story is much more open ended. In AC1, you keep chasing after something very mysterious. Each target you kill tells you something as they are dying that upends your first impression of them. The motives of your enemies and allies becomes complicated as the game progresses, and you feel like a tool caught in the middle. Most later AC games kind of miss this mystery, as the villains and heros are more clearly (and frankly better) defined. So the open-ended story-telling makes up for the rather shallow character progression. So I think AC1 is a really good game, especially compared to later AC games (which I like a lot). The repetitive elements of the game are okay because they aren't too simplistic. The straightforward story is supplemented by great atmosphere.Highly recommended.			"

												This game is great no matter how many times you revisit it. The copious amounts of collectables didn't really hold any value to me nor my gameplay but it's a little nice minigame I suppose, however I'm not going to go out of my way to really collect a ton of flags for no real value in return.Aside from that the atmosphere each city gives you as you enter gives a very real experience of a living breathing city it's just fantastic. I do love the whole secrecy of the assassin brotherhood and templar factions where you dig through each memory dechiphering what's really going on behind the scenes through each leader's motives, it's excellent and gives you that sence of abundance of knowledge where you want to strive for more.Still one of my favourite Assassin's Creed games by far, you were such an important role to the brotherhood only to be stripped and having to work your way back up again learning so much in the process.The game has aged well for it's time and so has the controls, the climbing mechanics are timeless and still work well even with the occasional bug here and there (eg. leap of faith into hay when the hay turns hard and kills you lmao.)Soundtrack by Jesper Kyd is amazing, love the ""Access the Animus"" track especially in those fight scenes.I may have 11+ hours but it comes from experience from playing it on 360.The only real big problem with playing this on Steam is the controllers aren't compatible at all with this game, you need to search the Steam Community guides to apply a fix manually in the folders of your game which isn't hard to do but it's just still a small hassle to go out and actively do it when it shouldn't need to be.9/10 game.

There weren't any games like this when it came out, and there still aren't today. The delicate wire of written and unwritten history which it balances is masterful to say the least, and is a game that, since I played it when it was first released, has a certain feeling which permeates it, of which I, to this day, have never been able to shake. Although the ending has been much maligned, I personally loved it, and felt it truly serves as the final brush stroke that brings home the entire game, and imprints it on our memory forever, if you will only invest the time and allow it to.

												Being a long time AC fan, and having mastered AC 1 by having played through the story almost half a dozen times, once when it first came out, and the other times prior to each new AC release, I must say it still does not get old.For players new to the AC franchise, it is a fantastic first experience to the world of AC, a parkour, medieval combat, and stealth game all in one, perfect for history geeks, consipiracy fans, and behind the curtain enthusiaists. This game not only lets you relive history in a slightly alternative way, but it brings it into modern times by tying in ancient secret world orders that have survived for centuries and now run the world behind the scenes. Manipulating history and giving its own explanation of how we came to be. It might offend some of you who are died hard stubborn religious people, but if you can just get past that it is a game, you will definitely enhoy it. (I myself am religious and still hold AC as my favorite game franchise of all time).As for the AC fans who haven't played AC 1 yet, all I can say is that, YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT, this is where it all began after all. Altair, the Grandmaster of the Assassin Order and most badass of all assassins. (Die hard Altair fanboy.) Apart from the previous, I will admit the game is pretty old and has it's flaws, it is buggy and VERY repetitive, but if you can just push through, you find it is a great introduction ,or re-introduction, into the Assassin world.11/10 would play and play and play again.

There weren't any games like this when it came out, and there still aren't today. The delicate wire of written and unwritten history which it balances is masterful to say the least, and is a game that, since I played it when it was first released, has a certain feeling which permeates it, of which I, to this day, have never been able to shake. Although the ending has been much maligned, I personally loved it, and felt it truly serves as the final brush stroke that brings home the entire game, and imprints it on our memory forever, if you will only invest the time and allow it to.

												One of the main reasons why I managed to not regret falling for the shillvide 3D vision (i.e. that proprietary stereoscopic 3D system) all those years ago. Absolutely MAGNIFICENT when played in 3D.Also, This is the best game in the Assassin's Creed series, hands down.			"

												Assassin's Creed. It's been 10 years since this game came out.. I've played it and replayed it over and over since 2012 and it's still one of my favourite Assassin's Creed games. But my views back then were different because there were only like... 5 main games. So what do I think now? well...Story:It starts off with Altair recovering an ancient artefact from Solomon's Temple. However, he manages to break 3 tenants of the creed. Once he returns with the artefact, the Templars track him down and kill the civillians and other assassins who live in the assassin HQ, Masyaf Castle. Everyone blames Altair for bringing them there so Al Mualim demotes Altair to a novice rank and makes him find and kill 9 templars who are trying to ensure the 3rd crusade continues. Altair kills all 9 but then the leader, Robert de Sable confesses it was actually Al Mualim who wanted to use the artefact to bring new world order. Altair then kills Al Mualim aaaand the rest is for Assassin's Creed Revelations.Also there's a modern story with Desmond Miles but... not much to talk about.Gameplay: The gameplay in this game is probably the weirdest to talk about. It's not great, because the games that came after were far better but it's definitely not the worst. Honestly, I think this game got 1 very important thing right: STEALTH. Stealth is what Assassin's Creed is about and it seems only this game can do it properly. The fighting is a little bit clunky at times but definitely not as easy as the likes of 3, Black Flag or Rogue. It's only when I played it on PC that I managed to figure out that sometimes if you counter then quickly press X, you can finish them off while they're recovering. I also like how the side missions end up helping you in the actual assassination mission. It suprisingly becomes easier, plus it'll tell you what you should do.Assassination missions:Tamir: Definitely the easiest. Just walk up to him and stab himGarnier de Naplouse: Make sure to stab him when he's talking to a patient. Otherwise he'll become Yoda and detect you while you're behind him.Talal: He just runs away... hold sprint and then stab him ._.Abu'l Nuqoud: Fat ♥♥♥♥er runs away and jesus christ he's like Dr Eggman in Sonic 2... faster than someone who should probably be the fastest.William of Montferrat: One of the best targets to kill. Running around in a fortress trying to not get detected... niiiceMajd Addin: He looks like Bin Laden. And there's a bunch of soldiers trying to kill you. Also quite fun.Sibrand: The worst ♥♥♥♥ing target ever. He's on a boat and you need to jump on ♥♥♥♥ing platforms to try and get to him. Don't get detected or he'll run away. Mistime a jump, you're falling into the water and dying. I've played this game like 5 times and every time, this mission ♥♥♥♥s me over. ♥♥♥♥ it and ♥♥♥♥ Sibrand.Jubair: This one is just... annoying. There's like 7 different people you need to kill and you need to find which one is the real Jubair. Robert de Sable: I used to find this one the most tedious. Both versions btw. In Jerusalem and Arsuf. But now that I basically know all the things you can do with the combat, I pretty much got past it in under an hour. I actually find it quite fun now. Cutting through a bunch of Crusaders and Saracens. It's good.Rashid ad-Din Sinan (Al Mualim): Very underwhelming... although I do like the fight, it could have been so much better.Music: The music in this game is really good. Very mysterious 'n♥♥♥♥♥♥ Not as good as 2, Brotherhood or 3 but still good. Jesper Kyd never fails.Overall: The game is still good and honestly, if Ubisoft made an updated texture pack for the PC version like they did with Watch Dogs 2, I'd be okay with that. I wouldn't mind a HD remaster either but as long as they show this game some love since it's the 10th anniversary... then anything is fine with me. The game can be repetitive in terms of structure, but it's still fun and definitely worth trying out.			"

												Assassins creed 1 is the great start to a great franchise and I personally enjoyed this game. If you play this game like I did and that would be taking its time doing all of the side missions as well as all of the explorations the game will take about 20 hours to complete and that 20 hours is well spent. However keeping in mind that this game was made in 2008 expect a few bugs and funky controls now and then. I would recommend this game if you never played any of the Assassins creed games as this game is a great start. Also I advise to play this first so that no story is spoiled in the later games of Assassins creed.			"

												Ah, the first amazing game in one, if not the most, amazing game saga of all time. Assassin's Creed: Director's Cut Edition is so amazing, with a gritty and brooding atmosphere. The game is fully open world, allowing you to fully explore the dark depths of actual places such as Damascus, and Jerusalem. There are plenty of opportunities to save helpless obese guys and screaming young Arabic girls. This game is very realistic, in which if you do anything socially unacceptable, such as stabbing people, the guards will take notice and chase you. In this case, you must break the line of sight by either climbing to the roof of a building or hiding behind your intimidating vigilante friends. This is not a game for the impatient though, as it takes time to slowly stalk a target and slide a blade into his rib cage without the citizens seeing you. If you are the type of person who would rather run in screaming, and wildly slash your way through the sword-wielding guards, then I would recommend some other game. Although, hacking guards is a large part of this stealth game. One of the largest building blocks in this game, (and every other AC for that matter) is parkour. If you like jumping over benches, scaling large walls, and swinging on beams to escape the soldiers who really don't like you, then this is your game. Although the controls are a little foreign at first, they become natural soon after you finish the ""tutorial"" level. The story is good, with many twists and turns, with a suprise ending. One thing this game lacks is cutscene quality, I mostly slept through the long discussions with the Bureau Leader. Although this game was made in 2007, it still holds its ground as very well constucted, with very good graphics (for 07) and a deep story. And, if you enjoy the other AC games, this is a great place to return to. Would stab and slash again: 8/10			"

 TL:DR at the end, scored 6 / 10 as of 23rd May 2016  Full Livestream Playthrough soon!  Borba Recommends Borba likes:Genre - Assassin’s Creed is an open world action adventure, with elements of stealth and a very powerful storyline that will leave players aching for more.Narrative - A very deep narrative, with interesting and well thought out characters, dialogues and puzzling secrets to discover. Borba warns that the game ends in one hell of a cliffhanger, so have your credit card ready in order to get the next titles in order to unfold the whole series’ most valuable asset.Interface - Simple and functional, shows health, wanted status, equipped weapon, a radar and a much needed control helper, since the game has context based controls that might be hard to memorize at first.Graphics - It can be said that this first game in the series aged pretty well in terms of visuals, despite looking a bit bland sometimes due to some sort of colour filtering.Music - An epic music score is present throughout the whole game, improving the overall experience.Sound - Excellent voice work and combat sound effects, with some repetitive generic villager and guard voice lines.Borba dislikes:Replayability - The game offers side missions, collectibles and an open world to explore that is based on historical locations, but no achievements. Due to the repetitive nature of the game, only diehard fans will consider repeating it, or doing a full playthrough that may take a few dozen hours. Regular gamers that just want to play through the main quests will take between 10 and 12 hours to finish, and feel glad they finally got through it.Gameplay - The parkour system developed for the game was ingenious, and despite having some flaws and being slower than later iterations, it’s still pretty good for its time. Combat is original and functional, becoming a bit too easy once players get the hang of it. The repetitive investigation missions and the viewpoint unlocks are Borba’s biggest beef with the game, quickly becoming a mind numbing chore that ultimately feels necessary to extend the game’s playtime into an acceptable amount of hours.Design - The world design is amazing for its time, however, the repetitive gameplay tarnishes the experience. Also, there are a couple of missable events that allow the character access to a few files that will shed some further details about the narrative. Borba hates missable things in games.Polish - A few issues still occur, including crashes, lack of subtitles, controller issues and parkour / animation bugs, even though the game is pretty much playable from start to finish it’s a shame these were never fixed.Borba feels like despite the issues with repetitive gameplay, lack of subtitles and some bugs, Assassin’s Creed I is the stepping stone, a necessary evil, for players to get hooked into a very deep narrative, which on its own turns this mediocre title into a worthwhile experience for most players that endured through its repetitiveness. 6 / 10  "

												Assassin’s Creed is a game with lots of cool ideas that ultimately fail to come together cohesively. You just get the feeling that the developers were forced to release whatever they had done for the 2007 holiday season, whether it was ready or not. In that way, it reminds me a lot of the first Mass Effect - lots of great ideas, cool story and universe, but ultimately not as good as it should have been (which, like AC, was mostly rectified with the second game in the series).But first things first... let’s break down what works and what doesn’t. As mentioned above, what works are the ideas the game puts forth, both in terms of story and gameplay. The story centers on a clandestine battle between two orders - the Assassins and the Templars. You play as Desmond Miles, a present-day descendant of Assassins, who has been captured by an organization named Abstergo (the modern day corporate face of the Templars). Using a device called the Animus, Desmond is forced to re-live the memories of his ancestor, an Assassin named Altair, in order to find a mysterious artifact. The game is played from Altair’s point of view and takes place in the cities of Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre, circa 1200. It is here that you can see where the majority of the work was put into the game. The cities are sprawling, alive, and built with tons of detail. You really do almost feel like you could be in those places at that time. It’s quite impressive, technically. Gameplay centers around two main mechanics - free-running and combat. Free-running allows you to run across streets, rooftops and climb buildings in a fluid manner. When it works, it’s great fun, but oftentimes you’ll accidentally fall off buildings or jump in a completely wrong direction or climb something you didn’t want to, etc. Clearly the developers hadn’t worked out all the kinks yet. The combat is interesting, but nothing special. There are lots of options and it looks great in motion, but it’s not particularly difficult or engaging. Simply mashing buttons usually works in most cases. However, you can clearly see the potential in it. So again... good ideas, but not yet implemented as well as they could be.Where the game ultimately fails is in the design. Assassin’s Creed 1 can basically be boiled down to the following: go to a city, climb a few towers, beat up a few people (or some other menial task), assassinate a high-priority target, return to home base. Repeat this 9 times and you’re done. It’s all very tedious and gets boring quickly. While there are a few different types of tasks and side missions that you can do in the cities, none of it really rises above being mediocre. The most interesting parts of each chapter are the final assassinations, but even in these cases, the verdict is mixed. Instead of actually being able to sneak around stealthily and assassinate your targets, many of these encounters just end up turning into a big brawl (not exactly what one would expect in a game involving secret assassins). Ultimately, the game is promising, but flawed. The ideas underlying the story are definitely cool and the environments are really nice (for their time), but as a game, it is simply average in most respects. It also doesn’t help that the Altair character isn’t terribly compelling and nothing really interesting even happens until the very end. That said, this game is worth checking out if the premise intrigues you and you think you might be interested in the series as a whole (which, for the record, DOES get better). If you think that might be the case, my recommendation would be to either skip this game entirely and watch all of the cut-scenes/ending online, or play through it doing only the barest minimum needed in order to continue. Grade: CNote: I don’t recommend playing any of the Assassin’s Creed games unless you have an Xbox360 controller (or equivalent-featured gamepad). The AC games have complicated control schemes and were clearly designed with controllers in mind, so proceed with mouse/keyboard at your own risk.			"

												Don't buy this. Unless you're a some sort of crusades-nut, don't bother with this game. Jumping straight to AC 2 is going to give a lot better experience about the series, and from there you can either continue or not depending if you like it or not. Sure AC2 isn't as good as AC: Brotherhood, but if you're going to follow the plot, might as well start there. What happens in this game is not important at all, and can be skipped with youtube-videos or checking a short recap from a wikipage.This game isn't exactly horrible, but it has nothing compared to following installements. The plot is boring, gameplay is seriously lacking and there's just nothing to do after first few hours. From there it's repeating the same places and missions all over again. Some design flaws make the game sometimes feel a horrible experience, although it's because the game just drags on and on. Luckily there are only few bugs and technically the game is a solid piece of work. Still the game is not enjoyable after the beginning as it lacks substance. I thought I would like this more than the second one because of the theme, and some ill parts in the second, yet I found that the last few hours of the game made me almost hate this one.""Should you buy it?"" No.""But I want it, it's only few bucks/euros"". Still no, your time is more valuable than the money you're going to spend to this. And no point supporting this kind of work.			"

												Looks nice, and the first hour or so is fun, but it fails to evolve or change in any way after that, so you may as well play the demo 10 times and watch the cinematics on Youtube. As a barely touched console port, the Exit to Windows button is about 8 menus and 2 minutes away from the game world.			"

												Hey! Im gonna write a short review about this, okey game...So, you start off by meeting Desmond, that has been captured by the templars. He goes into a machine called the animus to re-live his ancestors memories. This is when you start the game for real. You directly jump into a very interesting character called Altair. Hes an assassins during the 11th century. Hes in the middle of a war between the templars and the assassins. So, your mission starts directly, and you get it from his master Al Mualim. Your task is to set-off to the biggest cities around Isreal (example of a city is Jerusalem) and murder 9 different templars. This is where the most boring missions you will ever come across. You need to go on to a viewpoint to find investigations (from where you get the info about your target) and then assassinate the target. This is going to be for all the 9 templar ""masters"". But, the story do get very interesting, and you need to play this game to understand the sequels. Please dont understand me wrong, its a fun game, but do gets repetitive quickly... This is a game you should only buy on sale, where the price can drop to 2.49 euros.My score is 7/10			"

												Assassin's Creed is the first game in one of Ubisoft's trademark franchise. A game which started off as a spiritual successor to the Prince of Persia series quickly grew into massive IP of its own. Although it's the first in the AC franchise Assassin's Creed is far from a great game. It has its pros that grew to define the franchise for what it is and also several cons that needs to be address. The game is set in the year 1191 during the height of the Third Crusade between the Muslims and Christians. The game covers several Middle Eastern locations which are rarely seen in gaming such as Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre. It's great to see Ubisoft tackle this sort of environment in a more historical setting than what modern Middle Eastern looks like. The environment feels immersive in its on way with Crusade guards along corner, horse riding in the frontier and also sword fighting. You play as Altair, an arrogant master assassin in the Assassin Brotherhood who has lost his title due to his own pride. Throughout the course of the game you're tasked with eliminating nine Templars while questioning the motives behind the assassination an your Brotherhood itself. The story is rather forgettable because it basically involves you moving from one city to another assassinating on Templar member to another which felt repititive. The only redeeming factor is probably the plot twist at the end.The gameplay of Assassin's Creed is more of an action adventure game with added stealth mechanic. You can hide with scholars, on benches with citizens and also in hiding spots like stacks of hay. Movement in this game is rather annoying as Altair's running feels more like robot than an agile assassin with a poor camera control on top of it. Climbing also suffers from the same problem with some aspect of the building looks climbable but actually isn't. The combat of the game also doesn't par that well. Although it is still requires more skills than in future installments. You can't just swing your sword to easily kill all of the enemies as some enemies can actually counter and block. There's also no button prompts for counter so timing your counter is crucial. The stealth section of this game is kind of useless because sometimes guard can even detect you even if you're behind a wall. Even with all the research and eavesdropping about your current target, assassinating them stealthily is still a challenge bacause of the bad AI.With all that being said, Assassin's Creed is still a worthwhile game especially for die hard fan of the series. Even though it has its flaws here and there it is still pretty enjoyable being able to run across rooftops and escape from guards and also fighting hordes of enemies at a time. For a of a franchise the game is okay as it leaves a lot of room of improvement and I would gladly give it a score of 6/10.			"

												Assassin's Creed was am amazing game when it was released. The gameplay was novel with fluid movement unlike any video game before, and the plot was intriguing and compelling. The plot is still just as good, but the gameplay has not aged well at all. The game requires a massive amount of grind through the mid-game and most of the end-game, and many games since have surpassed AC1's freerunning and combat (most notably, AC2).I recommened that players attempt AC1 as the intro point to the series. If the grinding becomes too much to bear, watch the remaining cutscenes and story missions on YouTube and move on to AC2.			"

												To be honest. The game is♥♥♥♥♥♥- Controls suck balls- You die if you swim- Altair is an arab but speaks with an american accent- The game is ridiculously repetetive- Missions are boring (OH GOD THE PICKPOCKET MISSIONS! KILL ME NOW)- The real world character is boring as ♥♥♥♥- Climbing is slow- Has an absurd amount of bugsBUT WAIT!!! Theres alot of good points too!+ The game is BEAUTIFUL, the game world is simply stunning and its graphics are top notch.+ The storyline is very intriguing and if you can see past all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics, its a good story.+ The multiple non-linear story is good! The outside world storyline is also really good! (not the desmond guy, hes boring as♥♥♥♥♥♥AND THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT OF ALL!+++ It really gets you ready to play assassins creed II, the best in the series. It lets you torture yourself so you can appreciate how great the sequel is. And that, honestly, is why Its worth buying.			"

												Assassin's Creed is a rather enjoyable game. It has a pretty cool concept, the story is quite alright and free-running from rooftop to rooftop is extremely fun. You really feel like a skilled assassin when you are playing the game, at least for the most part. It gets harder and harder towards the end to dodge enemies and to make sure you're not discovered, but that's to be expected. You need to plan accordingly at times. The story takes place in an interesting era and is quite intriguing but sadly a bit forgettable. The combat (apart from the assassinations) is somewhat clunky and you can tell that it's a console port. You can play the game with keyboard and mouse but I recommend that you play with a controller if you have one since it's obvious it is meant to be played with one. I had a lot of fun with the game when it wasn't feeling repetitive. Climbing up to the view points was really fun and a few of them was a little bit challenging, too. I found myself enjoying climbing and exploring more than the combat itself.The visuals are stunning. The game is rather bright and takes place during daytime which is a bit odd for a ""stealth"" assassin game. The way Altaïr moves is also done extremely well, his movements are very smooth. As a nice treat; Nolan North is the voice of Desmond Miles - and you can't go wrong with that!A few negative things: Apart from being a console port with somewhat clunky combat, the game can get rather repetitive, especially towards the end. It also lacks subtitles which is crucial for many. Sometimes I had trouble hearing what was said in the game due to the background sounds. This is something to consider if you're like me and prefer to have subtitles. But all in all it's a nice game despite its flaws. It's a good game to start off a franchise with.			"

												*Friend* How is the studying to exam going??*Me* I'm about to kill the leader of the assassins who are actually a Templar!Anyway, for those of you who are wondering if i failed the exam, no i did not. i saved my progress and hope to continue next year. (;_;)This game is the first in the Assassin's creed series and that shows with weird controls and repetetive gameplay and no proper cutscenes. However, that doesn't mean it's bad. No, i actually enjoyed every second of it. the story is very slow at first and you have to play an hour or so to understand why you have gone back in time to play as your great great great x100 great grandfather Altaïr. who would much rather do a triple backflip on to a house that's 10 miles away and turn into a warewolf every third Thursday at full moon when Jupiter is right behind the sun's core and listen to Kanye SouthWest's new album than do leap of faith.this was my first time playing a assassin's creed game and i absolutely fell in love with this series. the ai have funny dialogs and i can easily spend an hour listening to them. there are so many different people that do different things. it makes this world seem real like this is what people did in those times when your parents were young and did not have phones or PCsBUT!!! if i meet one of those women who wants money one more time, i swear i will..... ohhhh!!! yeah i ♥♥♥♥ing hate them.The story, OMG. one of the main reasons i bought every single assassin's creed game there is. the story makes it 10 times more fun to play. i played blackflag for 20 min before i played this game and i didn't know why i went back in time or what they said about templars and assassinsi would recommened this game to anyone who's new to assassin's creed games, for those of you who have played the newer ones it might be hard to get used to the controls but i would still recommened it for the story.PS: i know this review is a mess. first time trying to do a proper review, give me some mosquito spray please!!

												I had Assassin's Creed when it first came out on Xbox 360. When it first came out, it was a novel game, running around, gathering information, leaping from rooftop to rooftop, and exploring beautifully rendered environments. Despite the control frustrations and the repetitive gameplay, it was still fun. However, with newer Assassin's Creeds coming out all the time, you can look back and see just how bad the original Assassin's Creed actually was. The game got completely left behind with its sequel Assassin's Creed II with a much better character, better mechanics, better almost everything (I think Lucy was slightly better modeled in AC1 over AC2...). Running around doing the same few things over and over and over again just to do one ""unique"" assassination, just feels more like a chore than fun. If you're thinking about getting this game for nostalgia, just skip it... unless you REALLY enjoyed it. If you've never played the Assassin's Creed franchise before and just want to start, seriously start with Assassin's Creed II. The story here isn't all that important and a nice recap is given at the beginning of Assassin's Creed II.			"

												Great story. Not as good as the later games but you gotta play it to go on to the later ones. A lot of people are saying that it sucks because it gets repetitive, but part of being an assassin is patience. Is there a basic recap of this game at the start of ACII? Yes; but if you skip this game you miss out on a very personal connection to the characters found within. Desmond will seem more relateable, Lucy will be much more human, and Revelations will make a helluva lot more sense if you can just sit down and have some fun with this.

The gameplay and combat is fun, some say it’s repetitive but I didn’t every get bored with it. Personally my favourite AC game due to its simplicity Took me just under 12 hours to complete. "

												Впрочем, главным героем игры стал вовсе не закутанный в белый плащ хашишин. Закрутив любопытную карусель с двойным сюжетом, сценаристы выбрали на ведущую роль современного обитателя мегаполиса, по совместительству подрабатывающего барменом. Сторилайн берет старт в секретной лаборатории, где наш персонаж обнаруживает себя прикованным к странному аппарату. Ситуация проясняется крайне быстро. Оказывается, протагонисту посчастливилось оказаться потомком одного из известнейших наемных убийц древности, и теперь некая организация пытается выведать из него бесценные знания предка. Раскопки в памяти производятся с помощью системы ""Анимус"", позволяющей считывать воспоминания человека на генетическом уровне. Честь опробовать в деле научное ноу-хау как раз и выпала на долю парня – после короткой беседы, в которой была озвучена пара убедительных доводов о необходимости добровольного участия в эксперименте, на сцене появляется восточный ассасин.Плюсы: графика «wow»-уровня; превосходная акробатика; зрелищные «фаталити».Минусы: быстро утомляющий геймплей; сырая боевая система.

Besides its character design or overall logic flaws (like running around in full armor and wearing the brotherhood's emblem is ignored by the game world. ..And in case things get hot, all you have to do is clap your hand to disguise as a monk (!), sit on a bench only seconds after being chased (!!) or jump off a hundrets of meter high building & land in a hey waggon (!!!).

												A sandbox game with plenty of tedium added for good measure.Graphics are fairly decent. I have not compared to the console version of the game. In the PC version the graphics are not ground breaking but are functional and polished. Animations are smooth and environments are well realised. The cities are modest in size and look the part for the period the game is set. The streets are littered with things you would expect, haystacks, street murchants etc.Audio is good. The most noticable thing about the sound is the background music which fits more with the modern part of the modern/historical aspect of the story. Apart from that the audio doesn't really stand out in any particular way, everything sounds like you would expect.Gameplay is heavily story driven. The story and premise is fairly interesting. The historical part of the story (the important part IMO) is about a disgraced assassin trying to redeem himself. The protagonist sees himself as the bringer of justice etc.Unfortunately the games is boiled down to but a few core gameplay mechanics such as fighting/evading, eavesdropping and, and the main one, assassinating. This makes the game incredibly tedious. The meat of the story is the assassinations, but to get to that you have to do a set number of the other stuff first. Unfortunately the other side missions become tedious after just a few times because it is ALWAYS the same. After 20 hours of gameplay I completely lost interest and stopped playing. Travelling between locations is also uninteresting, but thankfully there is a quick travel option. One thing that I just can't understand is the requirement to walk when near the authorities, it just doesn't make any sense at all. In Hitman it is somewhat logical, you are in disguise so you must walk to maintain your cover, but in Assassin Creed you wear your assassin's outfit everywhere, so what difference does it make if you walk or run?The sandbox presentation is wasted on this game, I think it would have been more successfull as a linear mission based style like Hitman. The developers limited the core gameplay too much when compared to the likes of GTA.If you have plenty of time to waste, this is an above average game but the repetitive gameplay was just a bit much for me, I can't recommend it to people with limited game time. Take a look at Far Cry 3 if you want a really good sandbox, or the new Tomb Raider for a nice linear experience. Both of those games felt shorter than this even though they probably aren't and they both felt much more engaging and interesting.			"

												Dull, boring, repetitive and clumsy. But very pretty. I really can't recommend this game unless you are completionist and want to know the storyline before moving onto some of the later, better, games. The control system is clumsy, ham-strung by being developed for a limited input system. Each area is repetitive and essentially boils down to: climb all the towers, save all the civilians, do a few races, beat some people up then assassinate the target. Repeat 9 times. The collection 'side quest' is infuriating, overly long and utterly pointless. How this game spawed such a winning franchise I do not know (but having played II I am glad it did). The good part I can highlight is it very pretty for when it was released and the free running is great fun (when things don't glitch...)			"

												If you're even a little limited on time & patience and you just want to play this to get a complete story experince from AC series. I suggest to go on youtube and watch a clip which gets the story in 5-60 mins. If you have time and are determined to complete the whole series storyline this is fine. Just don't pay the full price for it.For a game made 2007 graphics, enviroment and sounds are suprisingly good, of course there is issues with e.g. drawing distance but they couldn't think that someone really plays this with a 2016 high-end machine. Main storyline is fine.PC gameplay is awful and the game gets easily pretty boring. Bad contrallability, clumsy combat, no quicktravel, tens of repeating and similiar mini-quests before you get to the real main quest and and such a stupid AI.I don't recommend this unless you are obsessed to get all the games in the series finished (or if you're unemployed)Pros:+Graphics (2007)+Story+SoundsCons:-Graphics (2007)-Gameplay (horrible character & camera controllability, clumsy repeating combat, etc.)-Repeating repeating repeating "

In this tale of redemption you won't always be able to tell if the side your working for is in fact, the right side, and that's part of what makes this game so brilliant.The introduction of parkour into the game industry was spearheaded by this series, along with the aspect of historical tourism that the game provides. This series is still at the forefront of these factors, and although the first game itself can be fairly repetitive, it's still an amazing game.The character of Desmond is interesting and the large amount of intrigue brought on by the ability to retrieve the passwords of those looking over your progress in the present day portion keeps the story rolling.85/100			"

												Not a bad game story-wise but has it's fair share of issues. Very repetitive. And when I say very it means that each city you'll visit offers pretty much exactly the same informer quests, saving helpless old ladies and viewpoints. If you're going for completing EVERYTHING you're in for a extremely borring ride. Other issue is combat. While a lot of the time you can simply guard and the counter attack to dispose of the enemy, some attack were just completely not countereable. Not sure if that was a bug on my end or a feature, save to say combat got really annoying after a while, Overall not a terrible game but definitely the worse one of the series.			"

												Read down for why i do not recommend this game.This IS a great game. I remember watching a friend play almost all of this game when it was first released on xbox 360 and i remember how blown away i was by its fluid character movement through games open world something i had never seen before this game. The game had amazing music, sounds, world detail, combat, and story that made me very very hopeful for the future of gaming. I remember saying to my friend that it would be the most amazing thing after a few more installations of this IP how great it would be to have the games story move into the modern era with Desmond taking town to new templars. While i have not actually played the rest of the overkill that is AC annual releases it does not seem to have done this yet… This game remains very good.HOWEVER!This is a Ubisoft Title and with that comes the 90% of the time fact that it will just not run on computers a few years newer than the game very well (ie XIII & Beyond Good & Evil)A few of things i ran into finally playing this game in the year 2015 and what i had to do to make it work for me.-Absolutely no in-game overlays can exist it will just crash. raptr, steam overlay, caused ShadowPlay caused crashes for me. Shadow Play also caused graphical artifacts and sound distortion randomly. (while having all of these turned off or disabled there were still time that game crashed but i was able to get past the title screen)-The game will crash at random times when you complete certain actions like killing a templar in the game world because the game tries to connect to ubisoft server that does not exist anymore. Its recommended that you turn off the internet to computer you are playing it on but you can also use your firewall setup to block it.-iirc correctly this game may have come out before the wireless xbox 360 setup was available for pc. I “think” it was patched in later in the version that you can buy on steam. So the game does see the “wireless” controller but by default it is set-up incorrectly the triggers serve as camera movements left and right but are opposite. the colors of the buttons and on screen prompts are counter clock-wise wrong by one position. this can all be fixed with a little bit of tinkering in the buggy options menu or in the ini files.-not as important but still relevant. this is an open world game with  many thing to find and collect. two of which i found rather pointless. Flags & Templars. They serve no real purpose in the game. they existed on the console version for achievements and trophies that do not exist on the pc version at all steam or uplay. This is not a uplay game just fyi it was long before it existed and was never incorporated. but anyways while i am usually one to take my time and find all of the things in games this game gave me no motivation to do so, neither achievements or in game unlockables… -the actual controls and character movements now feel very tank like. a sort of inbetween modern 3rd person games and classic tomb raider for lack of better comparison.In conclusion This IS a great game and it is very fun but it was not made to be future proof. It takes a good bit of work to enjoy. I can't recommend it on modern systems but if you are willing to do the work get it running it is a lot of fun perhaps mostly nostalgia.			"

Of course the controls are classic and decent, but the main attraction is that Altair, of all main characters, presents the true faith of the Assassin's Brotherhood since he didn't started his path from some sort of passive tragedy or pressure of living. Altair and Shay are the characters whom I pay the most respect to.Highly recommended, even if simply for this belief.Nothing is true, everything is permitted.

												For starters, only play this game if you insist on playing it.  Other wise, just skip it.  It is not worth your money and it is a terrible game.  Here are some reasons why.The Bad StoryThe story is very generic and it's ending is laughable.  The characters are almost none existent and the story seems to have trouble developing itself, most notably towards the end of the game where the story just collapes in on itself and doesn't make sense anymore, leaving on an ending that leaves a very bitter taste in your mouth.  The story does have a few twists and turns you won't you see coming and they can be very suspenseful, but none of them last and are only small moments that shine.  As a whole, the story is unsatisfying and leaves much to be desired.GameplayNow, the gameplay as a whole isn't exactly bad.  In fact, it can be quite good.  For example, combat can be fun and satisfying and the free-run system is equally satifying.  However, the game mechanics work 90% of the time, but the other 10% it doesn't work makes the game infuriating.  The 10% is most notable whenever you are running away from guards, and Altair decides to have a panic attack and jump to whatever platform he feels like, coating himself with gorilla glue in the process, in order to stick to every pixel possible at the worst times.  It can be very difficult to control Altair during this instances and leads to possibly broken monitors.  As a whole, gameplay can be fun, but usually results in frustration due to annoying controls and error in game mechanics.The GoodStoryThe only good that comes from the story is the unexpected twists and turns.  I geniunely didn't see them coming and some of them did suprise me, leaving me somewhat interested in the story.GameplayThe 90% of the time that the game works, its enjoyable and fun.VerdictI only recommend this game to people who just want to beat the game to be able to say that they have played it.  If you are interested in it for other reasons, I say just look up a summary of the story on the internet and go and buy the 2nd game.			"

												It's a 3 hour tech demo stretched into a 13 hour borefest.+ Great and unique setting.+ Amazing free-running system.- Horrible story: Stupid characters, nonsense plot, obvious and crappy plot-twist- Unbelievable repetitive: Do the same assassination quest like 4-5 times in ""different"" locations with ""different"" bosses at the end (that's the whole game btw).- Lazy and boring combat: Just press the counter button whenever you get attacked, done.- Late-game: Non-stop waves of artificially stronger enemies. Then kill all the 4 bosses again without getting hit, game ends.- Upgrade/reward system: Start with every upgrade, lose every upgrade, regain the ability to grab ledges, seriously.- Pointless, empty and annoying hub world.The story sucks, the twist is visible from start, the combat is oversimplified crap and later it becomes an infuriating mess, the game lasts for around 15 hours, most of which consists of massive padding and faffing around. Skip this one, read the story on the wiki and move on, nothing to play here, just sight seeing and parkour.Simolius - April 2015			"

												I want to reccommend this game, but this game is a prime example of how NOT to design gameplay and combat. Assassin's Creed is a story about a former assassin, now-turned bartender, named Desmond Miles. Captured by the multi-million dollar company, Abstergo Industries, Desmond is tasked with using a device called the Animus to relive the life of his ancestor from the 11th century, an Syrian assassin named Altaïr. As Altaïr, you have compromised the safety of the Brotherhood of the Assassins, and now, you must travel the country to find and eliminate the eight Templars currently in control of the country to help the people all across Syria. Now I love the lore and story in Assassin's Creed games, I really do. But I don't understand why people think AC is a great game in terms of gameplay, because simply put, it's not. The combat feels slow and clunky compared to that of future AC titles, throwing knives are overpowered, the parkour is buggy as hell, it's hard to control your character and overall, the controls are just a huge mess.The missions are repetitive, if nothing else. You go to a city, complete a couple of missions to get information on what your target is going to do, assassinate the target, and you're done. The actual evidence missions themselves are why this are repetitive. At least the Templars themselves have motives and goals as why they're doing what they're doing, but when retrieving information, the individual missions feel shallow, like they're nothing to them at all. Honestly, climbing towers to get information about the surrounding area and jumping into a pile of hay at the bottom is the most satisfying part about this missions.The only thing about this game that I can recommend is the story. I will say though, if you're looking for context in AC2 about the characters and such, I'd say buy it, but don't expect anything good to come out of the gameplay.  "

												A very laggy title of a thirdperson stealth action game.The pacing of Assassin's Creed suffers tremendously from high input latency and generally influent animations. Gameplaywise a lot of aspects that seem essential for a good Assassin's Creed title haven't been implemented, such as air assassinations.Citizens and the environment have an uninteresting and generally unappealing design.Missions lack diversity, as do enemy voice-lines that basically play on loop.It can get really anoying really fast.Combat system feels unforgiving and unrewarding.It is very sad that the first title of the glorious Assassin's saga presents itself in such a content-poor and unpollished way as bugs seem to be omnipresent and graphics are badly optimised.I'd say don't even bother with this title. It's a bloody mess.If you are interested in picking up the assassins saga I'd recommend you watching a playthrough of the first assassin's game.			"

I would recommend it only to people who want to play the entire AC series since it shows important matters like who's Desmond,how he ends up in Abstergo etc. (matters that Desmond will summarize in the introduction of Assassin's Creed II anyway).The graphics is not bad and so the setting,even if the only places in which you can wander are the cities,some lands (that are all the same),the fortress of Masyaf and the assassins' refuges; I don't like Altaïr,this AC doesn't allow us to understand how and who really is this assassin,he doesn't give me any emotions. He's just dull. However,I really like the story and it will be better illustrated in the following AC (they're much better than this!).			"

												Firstly, I want to make this clear Assassin's Creed 2,3 and over, are all great games! but Assassin's Creed 1 is a big ball of mess, it's repetitive and the missions are boring and tedious and 99% of them are damn near impossible due to the inconsistency of the A.I. of the guards and man, they DON'T let up they are more persistent than Jared fogle wanting a small child on average you'll spend over 80 minutes shaking them off and a good 90% of the time in the game trying to get away from them, don't let the ""no U-play account required"" fool you it's the only Assassin's Creed game on Steam that doesn't have it and man, I will be blunt this game sucks I thought this would be a good game and I could forgive it's faults but 99% of the problems in this game come from the guards and the other 10% come from the repetitiveness			"

												You can explain Assassins Creed in one word and that word is ""Perfect"" I have never seen a character move around so smoothly in a game as in this game. The most realistic animations possible. Running, climbing walls, horse riding, fighting, jumping, it all looks amazingly good. The game is primarily taking place in middle east during the 12 century and the environment looks vey beautiful and has very nice graphics with nice screen effects such as when you take damage, when you fast travel e.t.c. Its a detailed game with high quality in graphics and gameplay. The fighting in the game is unique and is the most successful part of this game. The specific time click with the mouse makes it very fun and rewarding. Click at the right moment and see the awesome animations when you slay your enemy to the ground. You feel so very cool and powerful in the game when everybody has respect of you, they are begging for their life and are screaming in fear and pain when you slay the enemies. They will flee from you and the people around you will be screaming in panic. Its as awesome as it can be. The enemies are cocky and will mock you and its so great to show them who the real boss is. Highly addictive and fun. It works so well with the automatic climbing and running system in the game so its fun just to run around. The story is very good and smart. You are already a master assassin but you have been downgraded to the lowest rank in your ""clan"",so you have to start over from the basics. And its in the basics we want to start right? And by the time you do good things for the clan you'll get more and more of your gears back and you get to use your assassin skills again. (Its way better compared to assassins creed 2 when you are a complete noob that becomes a super assassin by touching his fathers clothes. So, utterly dumb.) The main ""quests"", or goals in the game is basically assassinations of important people. But to do that you need to gather information about them, so you do some different things to get this information. You beat people up, spy on people, pick peoples pockets, and more. Its mostly all of the same but the open environment makes the game far from linear. Every time you play the game again you can always try different tactics in different ways. The sound is perfect. The sword battles and crushing bones and slashing makes the combat more powerful. All the people around you are talking about what you're doing, they notice if you are climbing, hitting in to people, if you are drawing your weapon, leaving dead bodies behind e.t.c. Its a realistic feeling and you feel that whatever you do in the game matters. The voice acting is good. I do'nt remember the music so i cant tell. (I turn of the music when i play a game for a more realistic feeling but that's just me). To conclusion. This game is one of the best games i have played. I like games with high quality and this game fits my likings perfectly!			"

												Tried for several hours over many attempts to get into this game. The gameplay is just tedious and the story isn't rewarding yet. No reason for me to keep slugging through it. The concept of recreating historical ancient cities is amazing. Just poorly implimented here. I've heard future games in the series make incrimental improvements, but i was never able to get excited about this franchise because this game was a bummer.			"

												Assassin’s Creed is the first title of the popular Ubisoft Franchise, Assassin’s Creed. Launched in 2007, the game received enormous commercial success on consoles, but only a year later after its initial release, Assassin’s Creed was introduced to PC. Assassin’s Creed is a semi-sandbox, action-adventure-stealth game set in the Holy lands of; Jerusalem, Acre and Damascus during the Crusades.Assassin’s Creed is a beautiful game, every crack and crevasse is filled with amazing detail, from astounding visuals to overheard cries for help. The graphics are absolutely jaw dropping, despite the age of the game. The Vast cities of Jerusalem and Acre extend into the horizon with hundreds of buildings and thousands of people living out their daily lives. All the while the frame-rate remains constant.The story, or should I story’s, brings the game to life. On the one hand, you play an assassin during the Third Crusade in 1191 AD, named Altair. We follow his quests as he assassinates nine public figures at the command of his master. And on the other hand, you are put into the shoes of Desmond Miles, whose ancestor was Altair. Desmond was taken in by a mysterious organization for questioning, and put into the Animus. The Animus is a device which allows the user to revisit their ancestors’ past memories. Desmond is forced to relive his ancestor’s life against his will for unknown reasons.The voice acting is solid throughout the game. Conversations are completely believable and delivered with the perfect amount of solemn dignity. What you hear in the game is more impressive than what you see. In the cities with populated areas, your ears will fill with the pleas of beggars, the din of street vendors, and the occasional humming. At the top of synchronisation points, you hear the wind blowing past you as you climb for the sky, the barking of a far-off dog, and the twittering of birds.Assassin’s Creed is exceptionally entertaining in that it features a mix of fine stealthy exploration and exciting combat. You start the game off fairly weak, but as you progress through missions, Altair gains new abilities and increased health. Before a primary target can be assassinated, you need to gather intelligence. The methods by which you go about doing so present the most irritating aspects of the game. When you get a mission to assassinate a target, you have to do at least 3 side quests first before you can assassinate the main target. There are an array of side quests that you can choose from, like; Pickpocketing, eavesdropping, interrogation, and target elimination. The problem is that after doing one of the side quests, there’s practically nothing satisfying about it.After completing three side quests of any variety, you head over to an assassin’s bureau in the city and you get informed that you can now assassinate your main target. The problem is that all the bits of intelligence you pick up while on side quests have little to no impact on how the eventual primary target mission plays out. Beyond that problem, after repeating the process for each target, things got plain, simple and just really boring.The controls, for me, could have been better. I often found myself getting stuck on a wall, roof top or the side of a building as you can’t just jump anywhere; you have to jump from one specific point to another. This really got on my nerves, especially when trying to run away from guards, the last thing you want to happen is to get stuck. Combat in the game is fun and exciting, but it does have its issues. First off, there are a few combinations that you will need time to get used to. Secondly, the character did not always do what I wanted him to. This did get a tad annoying sometimes but it’s not a major issue.The player is given five different weapons; long sword, short sword, throwing knives, and a hidden blade. Each weapon is useful in different situations. The long sword is the main tool of self-defence, and is useful for big battles; the short sword is a light and fast blade which is useful when facing small numbers of enemies; throwing knives can be very useful as they kill the enemy instantly, and you can use them for long distance kills; and the hidden blade which is used for assassinations.Assassin’s Creed does come with a few issues that just can’t be ignored. Firstly, the amount of guards that walk around the roof tops is incredible. It is impossible to go anywhere by running ‘freely’ on the roof tops without alerting a guard. You can assassinate them, but after a while, that satisfaction of watching Altair use his hidden blade to slam down a guard just becomes boring and you just want to get to where ever you going. So then you decide to take the city streets to your destination, only to find out that it’s just as annoying as taking the roof tops. The city streets in Assassin’s Creed are plagued with beggars, drunken people and woman carrying pots on their heads that fall and break if you run into them.If you are on a stealth mission where keeping your distance or blending in is needed, just wait until you come across the beggars who run in front of you, and you only, and start asking for money, meanwhile your target is getting away as once the beggar is in front of you it’s hard to get them out of the way. Same scenario, but you are confronted with drunken people who walk around and look like zombies from 'Land Of The Dead', if you get close to them they will push you which ultimately gives away your position and you have to restart the mission.The Verdict:Assassin’s Creed is definitely not the best game in the series, with its repetitive side quests and annoying NPCs, the game can get a bit frustrating and boring. For somebody totally unfamiliar with the game, it's certainly worth playing. Even though the game does have its faults, it still offers a great mix of exploration and action that is just waiting to be experienced.+ Good graphics + Lots to explore + Great story+ Challenging missions- No side Quests- Controls could have been better- To many guards on the roof tops- To many beggars and drunk people in the citiesSCORE: 7.5/10			"

												Do not buy this game if you run anything newer than Vista or Win XP. I have a GTX980 running Win8.1x64 and the only thing I can 'enjoy' from this game is my screens flickering and saying 'Assassin's Creed has stopped working.' It won't even load. I'm no longer interested in playing this series, and will avoid buying any Ubisoft game, after having read so many others having problems just getting it to run, and about all the DRM insanity they put into this game. It seems when they were porting this from console to PC (another thing I'm remembering from this experience.. don't bother with a port unless its extremely well tested on PC) they were more concerned with people stealing it than having it run. Ubisoft, don't worry, I have no desire to steal this piece of garbage. I only wish I had a way to revoke the $20 you got out of this so I wasn't involved in funding your scam machine, selling non-functional games on Steam.			"

												This is a great game which I really enjoyed. The attention to detail and historical accuracy is excellent and you really feel that you are wandering around in the cities the story takes place in. I particularly liked the parts of the story that take place in Acre. However I agree with a lot people that the missions do get slightly repetitive towards the end causing the game to drag a bit at times hence me only giving it a score of 8. However it is a good intro to a very well done and fascinating series and a good hack and slash romp through a fascinating part of the Middle Ages			"

												Because I did a review of Assasin's Creed 2, I thought it only fair to review it's predecessor. Assassin's Creed (if I say ""2"", it implies the sequel. Other wise, I'm referring to the first game) initially feels like a breath of fresh air amidst all wildly rampant action games at its time. And it was unique (""was"" being the key word). The graphics are stunning and it helped buff the slim pickings of the stealth genre. However, as the game dragged on, you'll come to realize that all your quests are the same and at its core, you're simply repeating what you've been doing since the first hour of the game for about a dozen more hours. Only play this game if you care about the series' plot. Otherwise, skip it.Grade: C-			"

												I wish I could say this was a fantastic game, I really do. There are just so many things done so well that other games fail at...the writing is incredible, the story gets better and better throughout the game, the gameplay mechanics are really cool and new, I was really impressed...and then they went and ♥♥♥♥ed it up. Voice acting sucks sooo much...I hear wonderful lines and they're ruined by the awful delivery. The story...oh god it's just so amazing and good and creepy and awesome and then it just...ends...no fantastic conclusion, no Desmond escaping from the facility, no we have to wait for the SECOND one to do that >:F. And the allmighty thing that breaks the game is the controls. They're so horribly awful, whoever came up with it needs to be fired. It ruins the parkour because all you're doing is holding down two buttons and watching as Altiar does cool♥♥♥♥♥♥..no skill involved in that part. And then the combat system is ♥♥♥♥ed because it only responds to what you tell it to do half the time and the AI sucks too so they're constantly trying to hit you but then acting like ""nah Ima just wait here"" so then you try to counterattack and someone else attacks and then you die. I'm just so horribly frustrated with how good this game could have been. So many things done amazingly well, and so few ♥♥♥♥ed up, but those few things make it a bad expierence. 6/10...and I'm being nice. Buy the third one, that looks good.			"

												This game is great. I'm the type of person to try to 100% open world games, and this game scratches that itch very well. I played it off steam, so my hours don't reflect how much time I've actually spent playing it. Combat is a little weird, though. I struggled a bit until I learned that you can just jump over a guy, stab him, jump over another guy, stab him, too, etc., and take very little damage. The parkour bits are also very fluid and intuitive, which I wasn't expecting at all.I'm sure plenty other people have already mentioned how the ""reality"" portions of the game are tedious, and I totally agree. They're usually pretty short, though, and can be overlooked. Aside from that, there's a lot of fun to be had, here.			"

												Let's be real for a second. In terms of story, it's pretty damn good. In terms of graphics, not to shabby. But in terms of gameplay, well..... Then it's pretty damn bad. Look I'm not saying this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥because it's not. But I have to stress the fact that it has so many flaws like the other games in the franchise do (especially in the case of unity *cough*), but all it really is, is a repetetive game that makes you run everywhere and doing the same kind of short missions over and over. The small tasks you have to do just to get some information to progress the story (which you have to do over and over 9 times during the game's main storyline mind you), is so ♥♥♥♥ing lame. At least in the other ones there is more flexibility in terms of how you progress, and this adds a lot of variety to the overall gameplay. In this game however, you run around to the exact same places more than once, and the environments are boring and bland because the citizens have little to no emotion whatsoever other than running everywhere and screaming like chimpanzes high on meth with a splash of beer while driving a lambourgini backwards in a forest. When they see you running around they usually give you the same remarks again and again, like ""Oh stop your going to hurt someone!"", or there might be beggars who like to say ""Give me your ♥♥♥♥ing money."" which you don't have whatsoever. I mean why the hell would you go into a damn city populated by at least 100.000 npcs there, and not have some medicine or something. What about food? What about throwing knives? Why the hell do you have to get throwing knives from everyday thugs that are so damn indistinguishable from regular citizens? ♥♥♥♥, why is this game so god damn bland!?In short, I found this game to be incredibly boring, bland, stale, buggy, repetetive, and a whole lot of other♥♥♥♥♥♥ I like the parts of the story-line where you control Desmond better than the rest of this game, and no, I'm serious. Apart from the story which is pretty damn great, the rest of the game is so bland, so stale and boring, and I had an unpleasent expirience while playing. Only play this if your getting into the series. Although I will admit the hidden blade is pretty cool.			"

												While I have heard a lot of ok reviews, and wanted to play this on PC, however, 2 hours later, multiple suggestions to fix it and restarts and disconnected the internet entirely, and I am still maybe 5 minutes of actual game time in with it still crashing. This game does not appear to be playable properly on a current PC, so if you have never played this before and especially if you are not overly tech savvy and want to just play the game, find a more recent title that does not have so many bugs.

												I believe this game is fun overall, there are buts thow. The free running and combat can be slow and becoming very boring and annoying. The side-activities become slightly repetive but enjoyable all the same. The main story is excellent, being able to play as an assassin during the crusades is awesome and also a bit educational. This game may have its ups and downs but i highly recommend you play or at least give it a try.			"

												A long time ago this is a game I would've recommended to (nearly) everyone because of what it was at its time of release. Unfortunately, this legendary game, which spawned a huge franchise, has not stood the test of time and barely gets a pass from me now. The only reason this game gets a ""yes"" from me is because it's part of a series which has significantly better titles, and if you're interested in this series at all, I think you have to play the game that started at all. I assume it goes without saying that you should absolutely not buy this game unless it's on a big sale (50% or more).-----The great qualities of this game are: Wonderful setting and scenery. I personally think the game still looks quite nice! Some may disagree, but for its time the game was pretty and still looks good now. Another plus is the game's atmosphere and story are very cool. Assassin's Creed, AC2, and a few other titles in the series take a fun creative approach to history and I very much enjoyed the storytelling.That being said, unfortunately this game has a few major downsides which nearly made me hit ""no"". 1) There are many issues with this game on current PC's. It took me numerous tries to get the game to not crash during the ""animus tutorial"" stage. Which brings me to #2...2) Unskippable cutscenes AND NO SUBTITLES. These are one of my biggest gaming pet peeves and man do I hate them. This game is a big, big time culprit of unskippable cutscenes and MAJORLY hurts the replay value of this game. (You'll notice I only have enough to complete the game and do some collectibles). 3) The movement and gameplay don't feel as smooth as they used to. Perhaps this negative is not as major as the first negative. The game still feels alright and the movement is good as well as the combat, but in comparison to the innovations made in AC2 and beyond, this game feels stale and the combat/movement feels slow and jagged.5) The assassination setups are cut and dry. At the time of this game's release, the game was so much fun many of us didn't care about the repetitiveness of the information gathering part of the game. Unfortunately, especially since we've seen far better, this really hurts the game's enjoyment if you ask me.6) And speaking of repetitiveness, the collectibles are really, really boring.-----All things considered, I think you should play this game. It's the first title in a legendary series of games, and was a well- putotgether game for its time. The story is interesting, the assassinations are fun, and the storytelling is wonderful (not to mention pretty damn good voice acting, which seems to be REALLY lacking in big titles these days). Just be aware that the game has not stood the test of time as well as some others, and some things will be frustrating. But still worth $10 without a doubt.			"

												I've about finished the game, the story that is, and i enjoyed the main story even though it did get a bit repetative but anyway this is what I thought of it:Pros - Good Main story line- Gameplay was fun enough to ignore the graphics which were a bit outdated but not unplayable- The characters were more interesting than other assassin's creed games- Good endingCons - The side quests can be a bit laborious- It can get repetitive towards the end because your basically doing the same thing 9 times- The options are a bit lackluster as there isn't even a fullscreen setting you have to press ALT+ENTER to go back into fullscreen after tabbing outAll in all I think its a good game and is worth buying just put aside the the small problems.8.2/10			"

												I believe this game is fun overall, there are buts thow. The free running and combat can be slow and becoming very boring and annoying. The side-activities become slightly repetive but enjoyable all the same. The main story is excellent, being able to play as an assassin during the crusades is awesome and also a bit educational. This game may have its ups and downs but i highly recommend you play or at least give it a try.			"

												I think Assassin's Creed is such a weird franchise. It has so many cool things going for it, but then there's a whole heap of things that bring it down. I guess I would give it a Yes as a recommendation via Steam reviews, but from what I've played so far, my overall opinion on the series is more neutral.Anyway, this is the first game in the franchise, and there are some really interesting things about it. No other game has really done free running so openly like Assassin's Creed, or approached history with such a expansive and imaginative point of view. The time period is very unique and well realized. The simple mechanics (some of which are okay, and others which unfortunately are not well polished) are also surprisingly welcome, because for someone like me, the combat and gameplay isn't exactly what draws me in, it's the world and history, so I don't want to waste my time learning some complex systems. I think the problems lie with the combat and movement which are extremely hit-or-miss and the storytelling. Having most of the cutscenes take place from a static third person perspective is really off putting, and gives a really poor B-movie vibe for any story that is present. As well, the whole modern timeline thing is just ridiculuous. This game (and the series as a whole) needs to do without it. Especially considering there are zero likeable characters (in my opinion) in the modern timeline. I just don't care about any of them. Overall, I'd probably give this game like a 6.5/10. I think it's a really decent game, and it's definitely worth a look, but grab it on sale.			"

												Because this is the first game in the series, I had to play it. It is really nice, the graphics are okay and the story makes you wonder what comes next. There is one thing I didn't like though. If you're running a slow computer, you have to start the game through opening the folder it was installed in, and navigate to one of the dxs of the game. There is no standard ubisoft information about it anywere which is really bad. And then it doesn't even show the playtime! My 1.8 hours on record is the time facing blackscreens and freezes trying to start the game.			"

												Excellent story driven game. However, it is console port, not as bad as assassin's creed 2 where screen does not even display keyboard keys, assuming i know all the hotkeys, but its something you can get use to. Side missions are repetitive, same objectives with different locations, it is optional but it gives more play time. AI is dumb and annoying. Other than that it is really good story, it outweighs all the cons. Game has no replay ability except collecting flags. Only bug i have encounter is game crashes sometimes, but i was recording so that might be the problem. Big plus is no Ubisoft drm :)			"

												This game is the first in the large (and longed out) series of AC games, in retrospect this game is lacking next to the sequels in terms of voice acting, gameplay, graphics, interface, visually, storyline (although the storyline carries through the franchise).Ignoring this, the game on it's own is rather fun, but nothing too special. It's freerunning mixed with it's stealth and assassinations make it different to most other games and fun to play, especially as controlling these actions is rather fluid (though a bit dodgy at times).There are a few problems with this game that mainly include it's horribly boring cutscene style dialogs that go on for what feels like an eternity, and the game's horrible colouring, it may have been an artistic decision to make it so grey and dark and gloomy but it makes it feel depressing and look grim.9/15 - ""S'alright. Sequels are better.""			"

												Smart stealth mechanics, given a varity of weapons to dispatch your foes and wear a cool hood. As the name suggests you play as an assassin in the time setting of the Third Crusade -1191. His name is Altaïr an ex-master assassin which has to relearn what it means to be an assassin and along the way uncover the secrets behind the Templar Order, ancient enemies to the Secret Order of Assassins ""The Creed"". Slowly through out the game you get to use different weapons and get more familar with your parkour skills as you smoothly end any foe and explore the many areas and cities in the Holy Land in this era.Though some activities and missions are repetitive like racing, escorting, etc but they do get harder to do.One of the best games with an original story and unique game mechanics, this is one game you would love to play.

												Its a Little late for a review of this awesome classic. in short ITS A MUST HAVE, be sure to grab it on a flash sale, not because it is expensive but because it is part of special discounts very often.As for the game, this is the directors cut edition which includes more variety on the sidemissions, thankfully that breaks the monotony of the original release.Be warned that the combat system its fun but frustating, recommend to keep gaming sessions short or you will break a controller out of frustation.To answer some common questions:1. There is NO steam cloud, you can find your saved games in C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Ubisoft2. There are NO achievements or trading cards3. There is no benefit on finding all the collectibles, just bragging rights 4. There is no hidden ending5. You can use your 360 controller without any additional config6. The runs fine on Win 7 X64 can't say for the other OS Happy gaming!			"

												Assassin’s Creed is an undeniably ambitious game. Attempting to follow in the storied tradition of greats such as chocolate and peanut butter, it wants to be a bunch of awesome things made even more awesome by way of combination—specifically, equal parts tense stealth game, badass fighting game, and open-world sandbox game rolled into one. It even wants to deliver a complicated plot that will keep you guessing to the very end. The result is sort of like dumping your chocolate and peanut butter into a bowl of ice cream along with every other item from the make-your-own-sundae bar. The mixture as a whole is a little odd, but once you learn to identify the things you like and pick around the things you don’t there are some incredible taste sensations to be had.Despite taking place during the Third Crusade in the embattled Holy Land surrounding Jerusalem, Assassin’s Creed barely touches upon religious issues and instead focuses more on general issues of power over society. You play an assassin named Altair (pronounced Al-Taa-Ir) who is tasked with the killing of nine influential men—including both Christians and Muslims—towards the greater goal of restoring order to the land and bringing justice to the people. There is also another element to the story, a sci-fi bit that may not be to some people’s liking. Although it does permeate the HUD and other parts of the graphical interface it only surfaces directly as very brief interludes a few times during the game, and the story as a whole remains interesting enough to drive the action forward.That action revolves around the nine assassinations, and each one follows the same basic formula. You go to the city district your current target resides in (three districts in each of three cities), find out where and what your target is up to, and then take him out. There are investigation mini-games—eavesdropping, pick-pocketing, interrogation, and other forms of information gathering—which you must completed to move on, as well as lookout points to climb and citizens to rescue from the guards, optional tasks encouraged by the increase to your maximum health and additional means of escape from the guards they grant. The assassinations themselves often come down to a scripted sequence followed by a brief stalking or a brawl and a large dose of the plot. Though not entirely unsatisfying, those hoping for more of a Hitman-esque arena to set up your own style of assassination will be disappointed.To accomplish all this you’ll rely on Altair’s three rather impressive skills sets—fighting, sneaking, and acrobatics. Fighting, while it looks amazing with tons of cinematic flourishes and gruesome finishing moves, basically comes down to a one-button timing game. Repeatedly press the attack button with the right timing and you’ll score a kill. Likewise, the proper timing on that same button while blocking will score you a counter strike, either sending your foe sprawling or killing him outright. Mess it up and you’re likely to take some damage. There are a few other wrinkles, but that’s pretty much it. Your enemies always have swords, and come in maybe three or four different difficulties, but once you master the system no number of enemies is ever really hard again.When you don’t feel like fighting, or in rare instances when it’s actually required, Altair’s stealth abilities come in handy. Assassin’s Creed doesn’t use typical stealth mechanics though, but rather the concept of hiding as its mainstay. When the guards aren’t alerted, you can hide in plain sight, by moving slowly and blending into crowds. In this state you can assassinate even the toughest enemies in the game with a strike from your hidden blade. Once the charade is up though, you’ll have to run to one of many pre-set hiding points—piles of hay, small cloth-draped gazebos, etc.—or kill all the guards chasing you before you can go back to being sneaky again. It’s a little hokey, but it more or less functions as intended, leading to some tense moments and harrowing chases.One of the real highlights of Assassin’s Creed is Altair’s incredible acrobatic abilities. Taking a page from the Price of Persia’s playbook, Altair is a master of all things running and jumping. Anything and everything is a potential hand or foot hold, and scaling city structures using the seamless controls is not only a joy but one that nets very tangible strategic rewards. It also gives you an opportunity, particularly when climbing the many lookout points, to gape in awe at exactly how beautiful Assassin’s Creed is, arguably featuring the best art direction ever in a game. The cities and surrounding landscape are fantastically presented, and the panoramic views from high above are truly breathtaking.Through the first third of the game, which amounts to a greatly extended tutorial, you are shown all of these wonderful things you can do. What happens after that is a very subtle escalation of the difficulty that continues through the rest of the game. Hacking through guards too easy? How about larger and larger groups then, with better countering abilities and trickier timings? Sneaking around too easy? Try getting past more guards on higher alert who will spot you if you’re careless. Likewise, later city districts have trickier buildings to climb, with more archers positioned on the roofs. It’s a very clever and refined way to make a game, but the subtlety is at times too slight, and there is a great repetition of the same basic elements for most of the game with little in the way of overt addition.Incredibly stylish and undeniably unique, Assassin’s Creed’s particular choices in combining all these gameplay elements will be debated by supporters and critics alike for a long time. If it all sounds like too much to realistically fit into one game, at least in this case it is, but not by as wide a margin as you might imagine. The result, while not quite all it could have been, is definitely more than the sum of its parts. While Assassin’s Creed doesn’t manage to deliver a top notch experience in any one of these areas individually, it gets enough things right in all of them and gives you a lot of freedom in how to use them, all while looking pretty damn cool. Though it degenerates into a lot of fighting at the end, and makes a fair number of mistakes in its execution along the way, there’s something entrancing about this game and each of the amazing things you can do. Your mileage may vary on precisely how quickly the game’s repetition exceeds its subtle nuance, but it’s well worth checking out for the first times if not for the seventy thirds.Highly recommended "

												So, you'll probably notice that my gameplay time isn't that high, and, well, I have a good reason for that. The gameplay. In my opinion, this game had one of the worst types of gameplay I've ever come across, so this kind of forced me to try and get through the game as fast as I could. The fighting was very bland, the missions were VERY repetetive, and to be honest, I didn't enjoy any of the fights. There's also the fact that there were no subtitles, which is a must-have for me, very limited soundtrack, Altair spoke in an American accent in a time where America didn't even exist (Yes, I'm aware that they change his voice in Revelations, although I haven't played it yet.) and it was far too easy to escape the guards. One of the things I really did enjoy, though, is the storyline, especially the bits with the one-armed assassin. I'd recommend this to anyone who can stomache bad gameplay for a good story, but otherwise, I don't feel like this game deserves a recommendation. Unless, of course, you're planning on understanding the whole series' story.			"

												Boring gameplay consisting of repeating the same actions over and over. Several technical issues:- not recognizing xbox 360 controller correctly- problems with playing intro movies- no possibility to skip intro and dialogues in the game- game freezing- in some fights you cannot see enemies due to weird view angles where something is obscuring the view- only reasonable way to exit the game is Alt + F4, otherwise you will have to exit to main menu (actually you have to do that twice in different menus), select and load your profile and only then you have the possibility to really close the game (!).This game is a waste of time, terribly overrated.

												This game is the most repetitive piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥I have ever played. There is nothing like doing the same things over and over again in 3 different cities. The game consists of: Go to Acre/Jerusalem/Damascus, get the scoop on who you are supposed to kill, get all the viewpoints in the district you are exploring, do 3 of the 6 missions associated with gaining info on your target, grab a feather from your feather friend, kill the target, bathe the feather in the blood of your target, give the bloody feather to your feather friend, return to home base and get an earful from your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss. You do this over and over and over, until the very end when you actually do something else for once. Every now and then you go back to present day as Desmond Miles, the person in the animus controlling the main character Altair, but nothing really ever happens.Also all of the characters are pretty trash, Altair apparently starts an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and becomes a good person at the end but I honestly couldn't tell because I did not care. The present day timeline with Desmond is also basically irrelevant since all it is is finding out that Templars still exist.All in all, the only reason you should buy this game is because you want the very little back story it holds before you play Assassins Creed II, or you have already played most if not all of the series and want to go back to its roots. It's a 3/10 from me.			"

												Short verdict: it's not a stealth game, it's a poorly executed and repetitive horde mode with lousy battle system and mediocre story.My overall rating: 6/10.Story: it's fine, somewhat dull and lacks detail that later titles have, but in overall it's fine.Graphics: surprisingly well for such an old game.Battlesystem: attack, strong attack, a block, a counter, evasion, a grab and a grab brake - it all fused into frustrating♥♥♥♥♥♥of your patience, because there's no way how to finish battle more quickly (except for knife throw/stealth kill - with very limited opportunities), you are forced to go through the same repetitive choreography all over again. And with hordes of enemies on every corner, it's really a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥Gameplay: basically, it's the same pattern throughout the game: find the assassins' bureau, perform at least minimum number of investigations, kill the primary target, report of success. What changes is the city/city district and number of soldiers in the cities. By the end of the game, the numbers are overwhelming. There's really no way how you stay incognito, unless you are tiptoing through vast quarters full of beggars, thugs and crazy people, that all stand in your way to perform missions. What I hated the most was that there's really no way you could STEALTH kill the targets, because they were surrounded by number of guards. And that number was increasing with each next target. It felt more like hack'n'slash at some points.Side missions: climb points of view - reveals the location of assassins' bureaus and other side missions;save citizens - reduces number of soldiers and unlock vigilantes that might help you escape (it's not that much of a help actually);investigations: eavesdropping, pickpocketing, intimidation missions, escort challenges, killing archers/pursuers for fellow assassins, flag challenges/catching informers on time;collectibles: flags (a set for each city/territory).With every completed set of 15 objectives, you are granted additional health unit, but after you're maxed out, there's no point to bother with side missions, because they're all the same and do not provide any substantial reward.I have previously played AC3 and I think it's a wonderful game. I've spent 116 hours on it. It gave me a genuine sense of historic atmosphere and it really felt like a stealth game. Intrigued by AC saga and heroes, I looked forward for similar experience with the original title. However, what I found was frustration and disappointment. I really wanted to like this game, but I just can't. It's not a pleasant pastime, it's a trial of patience, which, I guess, I have, because I've actually finished the game. But it was not a fun ride, you would expect from such a popular title.The only way and reason I find this game worth anyone's time and money is with discount and to find out how the whole AC saga began.p.s. There's is one great thing about it, though. It does not have uPlay overlay.			"

												Its really too bad that there isn't an inbetween, otherwise my reccomendation would be ""eh"", rather than yes or no.Game:The game is VERY repetitive. Throughout the entire game, each mission is pretty much the same. - Travel to a city, where one of your targets are- Talk to Assassin at bureau- Complete 3 side activities (investigations) before you can take out your target- Report back to Assassin at bureau- Take out your target- Run away and escape from guards- Return to Assassin at bureau one last time to report success- Return home to report of your success to Master- Repeat (x9)You have 9 targets total throughout the game, which means you do the SAME thing 9 times before the ending of the game.It got to a point where I wasn't really playing for fun anymore, I was playing just to beat the game. Nothing is really exciting about the game until the ending.Story:There is a major lack of story and personality with all the characters. You establish connections with NO ONE, because of all the missions being the same and there being a lack of build up or story behind those you are targeting.No one is rememorable, except Warren, who I think had the MOST personality, and Altair of course, and even he lacks much of a personality, though he has more personality than anyone else in the game, except Warren.People complain about Assassins like Connor lacking any personailty while Altair has almost NONE at all!The little personality I got from Altair was; determined, focused, arrogant, and confused.I suppose a better way of putting it was that he had lots of potential but what is given is performed horribly.In later games there is story behind everyone you take out. They wronged you, they serve a big role in the Templars, they have information, etc.In this game, you get no story at all about anyone really, until the ending.Gameplay:The combat isn't that good, with it being to just spam one button and hope whoever you're fighting doesn't reverse you randomly.In later games combat is a little more fleshed out, with there being certain ways to fight certain enemies that make it more diverse, but here its the same fighting style over and over again, which adds to the repetitiveness of this game.There isn't a diversity in enemies either, they're all the same, unless you want to count archers and swordsmen as 2 different enemies, but they fight the same.Also I love (sarcasm) how when a sick guy pushes ME, it makes ME the criminal!Bugs:This game is a buggy mess. Nothing that is exactly game breaking, but constantly the viewmodel would break sometimes after being knocked down by an enemy, sometimes while doing a leap of faith I would die on TOP of the hay stack, sometimes bodies would fall out of the map through the ground, some guards would remain idle while I am attacking other guards RIGHT NEXT to him, etc.Again, nothing game breaking, but broke immersion quite often.Overall rating: 4/10You'd be better off just getting any of the other Assassins Creed games. This game feels like some sort of early Alpha compared to its sequel.If you passed this game up, you wouldn't miss much. You'd be better off starting your Assassins Creed experience with Assassins Creed 2, and just looking up what little you missed in Assassins Creed 1.			"

												The first of one of the best known series from this era. The tale of the Third Crusade and the Assassin's brotherhood is rich in details, historical facts and characters, and both the science fiction and history are well balanced. The graphics are impressive, especially in the environment design and art: each building, street and structure is rich in details. The gameplay is intuitive and the sensation of freedom running over the roofs or climbing to a tall tower and looking at the whole city below is just impressive. The game is full of bugs, giving the sensation that it was released before it should, but I didn't find any that really affected gameplay. Assassin's Creed do have a Achilles heel, and it is the level design: you just do the same kind of sub-mission over and over until you have enough to kill your target, the really interesting part of the game. Asides this only major flow, is a great game that everyone should try.			"

												Where to begin...- first hour I spent serching the solution on forums because game crashed constantly -  I had a problem to reach the tutorial, sic! (this is my first game on Steam with such problems) ...- when I finally found it game crashes ""only"" from time to time...  go figure- unpolished, full of bugs- controls system is really awful (keyboard+mouse)- camera goes crazy sometimes- assassination sequences are too long- this is an action game and... it is too slow paced, too much jabbering- can't skip chat/cut-scenes- no subs option- dull and repetitive- one button fighting system- if you like to be treated serious by the developer avoid this titleI wanted to give this game a try because I've heard a lot about the series, but my time is precious and really don't want to waste it on such unsatisfactory gameplay and annoying crashes. If you are a mature gamer, demanding something more from production, just don't bother, it is boring and repetitive as hell. I just can't understand how Ubisoft from such good idea for game made THIS instead...My personal rating 3/10P.S. Think twice when want to buy something from Ubisoft...			"

												I wish I could recommend this game, because I beat it on both PS3 and 360, and loved it each and every time - as I did the rest of the franchise.  PS3 version ran badly, but didn't have any glitches. 360 version was great and ran smoothly.  This PC port, however, was an insult. I beat the game fully to give this review creditbility.First of all, I can't see any difference in graphics quality in the PC version over the consoles. That's only a minor complaint.The major complaints are the absolutely game and immersion-breaking glitches you'll encounter in this game.  Enemy NPC models will twist around the floor like they're break-dancing.  Some will even randomly shoot towards the sky like Superman taking flight in Man of Steel.  Then there is the famed parkour elements that people enjoy this series for... they are an absolute headache in this game.  Altair will randomly slam into surfaces instead of grabbing them, falling off the building and to the ground.  Sometimes when ascending the sides of buildings, he'll stop despite pushing upwards on the analogue, and despite there being plenty to grab to further climb.On top of all that, you have to sit with your teeth gritted because at any minute the game could encounter one of the random crashes to desktop.  I think in the 19 hours I have recorded, I encountered 10, which doesn't sound much, but is built up enough over the course of the game, that you're taken out of the experience by expecting one at any time; and they can come at any time; cutscenes, gameplay, and so forth.The humble yet fascinating beginning of the lore throughout this franchise, as expected, remains highly enjoyable, especially if you're an alternate history buff.  This is about the only positive thing to be said.If you're somebody who's lived under a rock and want to finally get into this huge gaming franchise you can't stop hearing about, I'd say go straight to AC2 (a buttery smooth, utterly flawless port, with superior visuals to the console versions) and read a Wikia article/YouTube vid/etc on the first game.  If you're one of these people who absolutely must experience the story first hand, then wait until this is absolutely pennies in one of Steam's sales.			"

												Assassin's Creed:Compared to Assassin's Creed II, this game is unexciting and bland. It's really disappointing as the first entry for the series.Positives:+ Having completed Assassin's Creed II and subsequent games in the series, I can say the whole plot behind the Assassin's Creed franchise is great and well designed.+ Various weapons and fighting styles, use hidden blades and swords to strike down foes. + Free climbing and running, you can scale walls and buildings. A lot of the environment can be interacted with. Negatives:- Constant crashing on the latest GPU's, GTX 970 4 GB (2015), to the point of being unplayable.- The game world seemed really dull during my brief playthrough. It's quite bleak and lacks a lot of colour. The controls were also an abomination.- Graphically it's nothing fantastic. Even during release it was arguably poor graphics for its time.- For a game about assassination it's surprisingly lacklustre when it comes to the act itself. It's not really a stealth game, there aren't many creative ways to carry out assassinations...it's just odd. Assassin's Creed II struggled with this as well, but it was far more fun and interesting, so I can forgive it.- Constant repetition with menial tasks, like eavesdropping, interrogation and pickpocketing. Boring.- Pause interface is obstructive and annoying.Overall Score 4/10In my experience the games in the Assassin's Creed series are decent but have never had that 'wow' factor. Assassin's Creed is probably the worst, and well worth skipping. Starting with Assassin's Creed II is your best bet. You won't miss out on much of the vital story anyway, and you'll save yourself from this painful game.It's definitely not good, or anywhere close, but it's not horrific at the same time. It's just ehh..very, very bad.			"

												I did play the first AC after I had finished AC3. I do not necessarily recommend it to people who have played the later installments. Anyone who hasn't played any AC game yet will do better with it's sequels because this original AC still lacked much. I did play it because I was curious to see how the series, Altaïr's story and the story about ""Those Who Came Before"" started and was fairly disappointed.The cities and rural areas are fairly nice to look at and ride through. However they all look and feel sort of the same, both weather and the daytime are static (the whole game plays at sunny daytime). Perhaps one can see more in it if he knows Damascus, Israel and the other cities you visit in this game, though I assume they have changed a lot over the centuries. Monumental places and buildings are not ""commented"" by the Animus system whatsoever, which makes it hard for people who don't know these cities to connect to them and to their history. You do not buy places, build your own ""home"" or interact with the cities in any bigger scale either (there isn't any money or economy to begin with). There is some awe-inspiring feeling to the whole of Maysaf being the center of the Assassin order, and both Altaïr and his mentor have a feeling of serious- and meaningfulness you may miss within the later installments. But even then their outlines are fairly weak; after having finished this game I could hardly understand what the fuss about Altaïr was about for people to apparently miss him so much when Ezio became the new protagonist in AC2. Altaïr didn't feel as special as I had believed he was, hell you will probably dislike him because he is an arrogant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ throughout most parts of the game.The true letdown is the gameplay. The combat is underdeveloped compared to the sequels (you cannot strike down enemies  with assassination streaks as they were introduced with Brotherhood, you don't have as many weapons - it didn't feel as enjoyable) and the progression throughout the game is pretty repetitive. This original game is probably most faithful to the idea of being an assassin as you are constantly tasked to kill some templars hiding in the cities, often wealthy or well-protected people you need to ""locate"" first by doing minor tasks that in the later installments would pass for ""side activities"" at best: Eavesdrop one some guys, beat up/question another, pickpocket some intel from someone else and the likes. There are about 5 of these tasks to do per kill target, you choose which to do and need to finish about 3 of them to be able to ""locate"", approach and strike your kill target (which thankfully have some background, and are approached in a bit more interesting way than your previous tasks). After that you go back to Maysaf, speak to your mentor and go for a new target. Rinse and repeat. And that's already about it mostly. There are activities having the nature of ""collectibles"", like killing templars hiding in specific locations in the cities and rural areas, or saving citiziens from repressive soldiers, but those activites are very repetitive too. They didn't really motivate me much to roam about more than I had to. There are some unique story/plot moments, but they are rare.Also, this game had an usability issue: It doesn't have subtitles. It may seem stupid, but apparently it wasn't self-evident back then. For a game trying to take serious steps in storytelling and bringing some past time to life it would help to understand all the people. I think they all speak English in this game (in the later games the citizens partly speak in their native language), but I still can't understand them all because English isn't my main tongue. There are some whisperings of story-relevant characters in parts of the game - don't expect me to get any of their lines too well either.			"

												From the old days, when Ubisoft isn't EA. Comes a game inspired from The Prince of Persia, that spawn a way better franchise than Prince of Persia. Assassin's Creed.You probably already played the sequels, so now play the game that start it all. Where you will get totally dissapointed and bored if you already play the rest of the franchise. Play as Desmond Miles, a bartender who's actually have the most awesome family tree ever. Who was kidnapped by an evil company, like Ubisoft now, where he's forced to use a machine to play a game about his great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great grandfather, Altair, a Syrian assassin that spoke like he's from The United States. So with the Animus, you will journey to 1191 Syrian, where you ride along in Altair's quest to kill a few templars. How? By doing the same old side mission like, Listening to people talking, Pickpocketing, Collecting Flags, and Being hired as a bodyguard. When you're finished, you can kill those templars with your limited set of weapons like swords, hidden blades, throwing knives, and nothing else.So, if you think Assassin's Creed Unity was bad, Black Flag is boring, AC3 is dull, and The Ezio Trilogy is awesome, this game is well pretty much worse than the others.Starring :Syrian Desmond, Assassin Saruman, Lex Luthor, One handed Bass, The 7 deadly templars, and nothing else.Assassin's Creed 1			"

The Assassins Creed series is an amazing Franchise barring Unity, but this product feels like an unfinished mess.I was told I should play through this one through my replay of the series to fill myself in on the extra details of the story, because apparently Revelations makes more sense when you do that. The thing is, the game is downright unbearable. At one poing during a pickpocket sequence in Damascus, the game bugged out and didnt register I had to pick pocket anyone. I held shift and I simply continued to brush people aside, constantly getting caught. With fundamental bugs like this, Ill watch a playthrough or look it up if I feel inclined to see the entirety of this game's story.Please start with the second game if you want to delve into this series.

												The game that started it all, it has actually aged fairly well.  Even though newer games are prettier and better and have better storytelling and less repetitive gameplay, I still recommend to go ahead and start from the beginning.  The settings are still pretty, and the gameplay is still fun, if a bit repetitive by the time you get to the end of it (you might skip a few of the optional collections which is just fine).  The storyline of these games are direct sequels of each other, so I definitely recommend starting with this one before moving on to others in this great series.  If you skip most of the optional collecting, the game should only take a few hours to beat.Controller support is enabled but for some reason the default keys seem to not match up correctly.  Especially if you have played later games in the series, be sure to remap the controls before playing or you'll get a little turned around.			"

												I started off by playing Assassin's Creed 2, staring Ezio Auditore. Safe to say when I went back to play the original Assassin's Creed, while I was impressed with the story line I was anything but with the actual game play. Objectives weren't clear, game controls were signifcantly different to the subsequent AC games, and certain aspects of the game simply didn't make sense like why the guards were constantly on high alert even though they have no idea what you look like and so have to shift around the game slowly while in the prescence of guards. Something which also annoyed me was that our little protagonist can drown.... A (soon to be) Master Assassin can drown. Kind of takes away the magic.I found myself getting bored within 3 hours of game play and I have no drive to complete this game whatsoever. I regret buying this on the summer sale 2016, and I instead wish I had purchased Assassin's Creed Revelations so I could at least finish Ezio's story.Just avoid it.			"

												5/10One of the most frustrating, irritating and stupid games I've ever played+ historic connection+ Acre, Jerusalem+ concept of the game- good concept is not followed by adequate game mechanics- frustrating controlling system (press 3 buttons to jump of the roof?! seriously? [X360 controller])- r*tarded fighting system- stupid, repetitive side-quests- assassinations in daylight in front of all the people?!- f*cking beggars (Please, sir, can I have your money? - that is nice mataphor, beggars are the creators of this game)- you can't skip cutscenes, you have to listen to this whole BS after every assassination- ridiculous plot- frustrating things like: 1. riding on a horse - you can ride, but only slowly, if you ride fast you HAVE TO BE AN ASSASSIN, LET'S PURSUE HIM AND LET'S CONNECT MINDS WITH ALL OTHER GUARDS AND TELL THEM THAT THIS MAN RIDES HIS HORSE TOO FAST2. exiting a game - how can you f*ck up such simple thing? that's a masterpiece in AC - to quit a game you have to:I. Press start and choose ""Exit memory"" (loading screen...)II. Press Exit Animus (animation of dude getting up from the animus...)III. Press start and choose ""Quit game"" (loading screen...)IV. Press any keyV. Select profile (SERIOUSLY?!)VI. Press Exit game3. No stealth system in games about assassins4. Kill, run from million guards, repeat5. Assassin gets the target of assassinasion, then gathers informations about him, then asks in bureau if that's enough (how did they pick the target previously? randomly?)			"

												Assassin's Creed......It's really hard to say about the sheer size and brilliance of Assassin's Creed into words. It is an epic game that you have to experience for yourself. The cities of the Holy Land have been nicely rendered. The people, the environment & landscape has been designed so briliantly that it gives an uncanny feeling which cannot be descibed with words. Although the game-play & becomes repetative after a while, but it is truly an incredible experience. I will definitely recommend this game :)			"

												I thought popularity meant something. I thought ""Hey, a lot of people talk about this, it must be worth buying the first 3 games!""It was an absolute waste of money. This is the most dull, repetative, obnoxious game I've ever bought on Steam. It's advertised as an awesome stealthy assassination game, but it doesn't come even close to delivery. NPC's do nothing and the AI is probably the worst excuse of an obsticle I've ever seen. Gaurds mean absolutely NOTHING, remaining in stealth is useless, and the story is just rehashable garbage. You could literally just run past every single gaurd in a b-line to the objective while you play the same mission with different chars every time. But hey, you want to just try it though, right? 80% positive reviews means this guy is probably just havin' a bad day.Go watch a playthrough. Check it out on Youtube or something first before you pay for ANY one of these recycled games.			"

												The story and concept is wonderful. New and exciting.Unfortunately, that is where it ends. if you manage to slog your way through the extremely long and boring introduction, that is plagued by extremely confusing control schemes that are constantly changing, a headache inducing visual affect to tryin and give the impression of ""being in a computer"", that just drags. it's not even a couple minutes. Prepare to spend 15 minutes on the tutorial (unskippable) before even starting the introduction, which slags on nor another hour or so of more tutorials. Even if you manage to get past this part, you quickly realize that the game is going to be excessively long as you are forced to repeat the same gameplay over, and over, and over, and over, and over and over again.Here's a tip: don't buy this game. Go read the story online. the story is great. the game is not. I've been told at least that Assasin's Creed 2 is much better game and is actually amazingly fun...after about 6 hours of gameplay, I'm stopping playing this one and will jump forward in the series in hope for redeption. This game has not aged well, despite being only 5ish years old "

												Assassin creed PC at first glance is beautiful and the main character one of the coolest looking. Assassin creed is fun with it's unique fighting style, art work, mechanics. BUT it has it's flaws from not properly saving to clunky jumping, lack of weapons, attack animations, and terrible repetitive gameplay forcing you to find and do boring things like climbing tall towers, pick pocketing that seems so bland and useless, than you realize everything is copy and pasted. The story feels awkward, with no immersion everything you do in the game you do in the first coupe of hours.The game sometimes forgets weather you want to jump down or go up and bugs out  on some of the simplest climbing movements. Some games didn't save properly, and some broken missions caused me to restart several times.Also 4 a Assassin game, no stealth is ever needed for the main missions whats up with that?The dialogue beside the main assassinations are all repeats just like the buildings, gets old pretty quick.I can see why people like this creed, I do not.I like the concept of the game, like most it failed horribly at keeping me entertained.

												While I can't deny that this game is a groundbreaking one, I can't help but feel this one is very lackluster when compared to its sequels. While that is to be expected in any game series (or at least most game series), I just could not find replay value in this one after I beat it once. But like I stated previously, I cannot deny the fact that without this game its sequels never would have been produced so I cannot help but have total respect for this game. All in all, it has a good story (although static camera angles for long periods of time makes it difficult to commit to it), but unrefined gameplay. If you want to get into Assassin's Creed, definately start with this one because it is a good steppingstone to the future games and also provides a good deal of story that is used throughout the series, but if you are looking back from Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and wondering if this one is worth replaying, just be wary and know that (gameplay-wise), this game is far less refined.

												((Now, to start with; I should probably say that I played this game during 2013, so quite a long time after the initial release. So this review will not play on any nostalgia, whatsoever.I thought Assassins's Creed IV: Black Flag looked like a really good game, and as a fan of pirates I felt that it was something I definately wanted to play, but due to me being a massive lore nerd I felt I had to play all the predecessors beforehand. That hopefully explains my playstyle of this title, I just wanted to get thru it, doing only the odd side objectives, in order to get to the more recent games quickly.))I did not enjoy Assassin's Creed particulary. The game has incredible potential, both in setting and gameplay mechanics, but it falls very flat on both. The story follows Desmond Miles, a man living in the present time who, by the help of a machine called THE ANIMUS, can take control of his ancestor; the Assassin Altaïr. The Idea of it is very neat and the setting is, to begin with, very interesting. The problem is that after an hour or so you have already figured out every plot twist and turn that the game will hold in store for you and every character you meet is completely forgetable. I perticularly found the main character Altaïr dislikable, which doesn't help considering you have to play as him for the ~10 hour gametime. The fact that he speaks with a clean American accent also takes away from the setting. Now, I do understand that Altaïr is supposed to be Desmond and vice versa because of the Animus, but the accent is just too jarring and out-of-place to fit in properly.The only thing I can really say is that the parkour gamplay is a very good place to start, as a completely new IP. But the more you play, the more you become irritated with huge bugs and glitches and by the end you just want to throw it away.That said though, controlling Altaïr is like a sodding delight compared to controlling the other main character Desmond, who is like steering a massive tank. Which has just shatted it's pants.I am not looking to offend anyone who really liked this game when it came out. Because back then I am sure this was incredible, on the PS3 and X360. But now, 2013 it hasn't aged well at all. That, and the PC port is absolute garbage. On an AMD FX-8350 and an AMD Radeon R9 290 it averages ~30 FPS. (Brotherhood constantly stays over 60)Now, should you play it?If you would like experience it on it own merit - No. It's not worth it.If you want to play the entire saga - Maybe, I did it, but I didn't have to because everything that you learn in Assassin's Creed (I) is summed up in a two-minute cutscene at the start of Assassin's Creed II. Which, while it has massive flaws, is a vastly superior game.			"

												So I've long been looking forward to play Assassin's Creed and have heard so much good about the series. Now I finally got into it but I'm SO dissapointed! It's one of the most repetative games I have ever played. I can take the view points but I sure wish there was more variety to the save citizen and assassinations. I kind of want to just hurry through the actual storyline and skip all these side stuff, but at the same time I want to complete the game 100%, but playing this is starting to feel like a chore...and a game should not make you feel that way!+ Decent graphics and location settings+ Storyline is okay- Repetative!- At times strange and a bit clunky controls.- No challenge whatsoever for a decent gamer. The game should feel lucky I'm not too good at games! ;)			"

												If you love spending hours upon hours of doing nothing but the same thing over and over again, then I highly recommend this game. If you value your time more than an unemployed-by-choice middle aged man living at home with his parents, then look elsewhere for entertainment. This game consists of extremely bad AI, a rather dull, very slow and predictable moving story line (I would have enjoyed a novel based on this. But a game was not needed). It's just one of those games where the concept is good, but the execution leaves much to be desired.			"

												This is the story about some guy who is kidnapped by someone else and forced to use the mumble to mumble mumble the memories of mumblemurf for some reason or other. The game doesn't have subtitles. An unfortunate design choice for two reasons.The first reason: Many of the actors(?) haven't quite figured out how to open their mouth while talking.The second reason: talking is pretty much everything that happens in this game.Don't believe the lie about open-world gameplay, parkour moves and total freedom. All I seemed to do in this game was to hold forwards from one dialogue-ridden cutscene to the next. Sure, I had the option of parkouring about the place, but it didn't bring forth feelings of open world movement and pulse-pounding action. Freerunning simply felt like a carrot being dangled over my nose on the other side of a window, designed solely to frustrate me while I wait through another cutscene.Wait seems to be the keyword in this game. The intro in particular is an irritating wait. Intros are to be skipped. We see them the first time, and then we skip past them because we've already seen them. But no. The developers don't care about me wanting to play a game, they've got religious nutters to placate, leaving me to tap the escape-button with no real hope of being let into the game any time soon.Still, if you've got good hearing, a high tolerance for tricky control schemes, and a genuine interest in Mumblemurf's backstory, I'm sure the game is good.

												Assassin's Creed is a tale of two games: the one that is an interesting and new intelectual property, and the one that reeks of committee-based game design focus grouped for mass market consumption.  I desperately wanted to play the first, but the second wouldn't leave me be and ultimately became the experience of this game.Ubisoft's brand of boring and repetitive combat makes its series debut in AC.  Add to that the three virtually identical main set pieces, and you will be left amazed as I was that so bland a game could come from the hundreds of creative people who had a hand in making this title.  Adding more creativity to the production does not necessarily mean more creativity in the final product to be sure.The tragedy of AC is that underneath all this blandness lies a pretty interesting story of inter-temporal... well... something or other.  The story was obfuscated by the very presentation that was meant to tell it.  I had to youtube the ending and secret story points after beating the game just to see wtf happened.  This obfuscation could have been by design, which is possible as Ubisoft does tend to put the finer points of the game's story into easter eggs to be found by the player.  And maybe that's my fault for not recognizing and engaging that.  But with such a bland gameplay experience, I was left uninterested in anything other than finding something exciting and pulse-pounding about Assassin's Creed, which is ostensibly an action game.  Reading in-game emails and interpreting glyphs on walls would not have qualified as exciting at that point for me.The final and in my opinion unforgivable F-you from Ubisoft is that this game has in effect no ending.  Clearly Ubisoft had intentions to serialize this franchise, which is fine.  But you have to have an ending in the first release of an IP, even if you have a cliffhanger in it as AC did.  The original Halo did it, Star Wars did it.  It's a rule.  Period.Assassin's Creed works, and somewhere in there is a compelling story, but you're probably better off with either of Ubisoft's other platforming/action titles Splinter Cell or Prince of Persia.

												Assassin's Creed Review:11 hrs completion time5/10With a weak and predictable storyline mediocre graphics, repetetive side objectives and repetition of missions it was a bland experience that I struggled to get through. Coupled with the problems in the fighting system such as not being able to block properly as the game chooses when it wants to block plus ""free run"" mechanics randomly choosing also where to jump randomly I have jumped straight through buildings into a haystack instead of climbing.With no real variations in cities apart from cultures shifting from Arabic to European the objectives and citizens stayed all the same with only changes to clothing but voice work remained the same.

												I have no idea how a potentially great game could be made so annoying and frustrating.It all started with traveling to the cities for the first time. Since you've never been there you don't have fast travel. It was really boring riding there especially when guards came by and I had to walk slowly, taking a lot of time for nothing.At the cities as I got deeper into the game was when I realized how flawed and annoying this game could be.Most of the time Altair never jumps where I want him to, even if I point my controller at the exact position. This can be really annoying when accidentally falling down or trying to escape guards.Another very annoying thing is the distracting citizens. The beggers, the drunk fist fighters, the people who just push you for no reason. I fail to understand why this content got into the game for any other reason but to annoy the player. You can't really make a stratigical move to avoid them since they are at random places and/or follow you around.The gameplay becomes very repetitive once you got your first assassination, it's just climbing towers to find mini-missions, completing them and going for the big kill, which would be the only fun part of the game if all the careful planning, taking care of rooftop archers and finding a good escape route would not be ruined by a drunk guy randomly pushing me into my target or a guard.Probably the most annoying thing is the people of the cities speaking the same things over and over again. The high score for me was a guard harassing a guy saying ""You dare steal in my presence? That will cost you your life!"" six times over and over again.Without all the annoying content the repetitive gameplay would not be so bad since the story seems great so far and the great (but currently buggy) engine of the game would compensate for the boring submissions.tl;dr: one of the most annoying games I've ever played and all it would take to fix it is a patch			"

												For all its hype (perhaps its the series in whole), the first game in the Assassin's Creed Series is boring at best.The story is light, perhaps only gets interesting once you reach Robert De Sable.This is repetetive gameplay with pretty visuals and reasonable audio.The side missions are completely filler material and prove very little value to a story driven promise.On the plus side, controls are responsive (confusing at start), camera and parkhour generally works 90% of the time.I guess you'd play it if you plan on playing the entire series.. what choice is there?

												Unless you like doing the same thing over and over again, then this game is not for you.The good:    Graphics - Considering it is not new game, it looks pretty good even now, large cities all with distinct features.    Story - This is the only reason, I wanted to keep playing as story is great, but I just can't force myself to do it anymore.    Movement - Parkour is great, one of the coolest features. Jump anywhere, climb, running on the roofs is pretty fun.The bad:    Controls - It may have been made for consoles, but controls are not really intuitive (default) ones    Combat - Very simplistic, that doesn't require much thought, only pressing button at the right time.    Repetitive gameplay - Quests are the same, everything is the same, if you've done it once, you will do the same thing another 20 times.			"

												So I've long been looking forward to play Assassin's Creed and have heard so much good about the series. Now I finally got into it but I'm SO dissapointed! It's one of the most repetative games I have ever played. I can take the view points but I sure wish there was more variety to the save citizen and assassinations. I kind of want to just hurry through the actual storyline and skip all these side stuff, but at the same time I want to complete the game 100%, but playing this is starting to feel like a chore...and a game should not make you feel that way!+ Decent graphics and location settings+ Storyline is okay- Repetative!- At times strange and a bit clunky controls.- No challenge whatsoever for a decent gamer. The game should feel lucky I'm not too good at games! ;)			"

												I didn't enjoy this game. I know enough of the story from watching lets plays before I started playing that over all the franchise is pretty good but this game is just really dull to play. Once the novelty of running around wears off the game is ultimately just a grind fest of similar challanges. If there where acheivements then maybe I would of enjoyed it more but I had no reason to pick up those last few flags or complete all the challanges. I recommend you pick up this game at some point, like I said its a good series and the story is worth a look but gameplay wise it's fairly dull and a chore.			"

												((Now, to start with; I should probably say that I played this game during 2013, so quite a long time after the initial release. So this review will not play on any nostalgia, whatsoever.I thought Assassins's Creed IV: Black Flag looked like a really good game, and as a fan of pirates I felt that it was something I definately wanted to play, but due to me being a massive lore nerd I felt I had to play all the predecessors beforehand. That hopefully explains my playstyle of this title, I just wanted to get thru it, doing only the odd side objectives, in order to get to the more recent games quickly.))I did not enjoy Assassin's Creed particulary. The game has incredible potential, both in setting and gameplay mechanics, but it falls very flat on both. The story follows Desmond Miles, a man living in the present time who, by the help of a machine called THE ANIMUS, can take control of his ancestor; the Assassin Altaïr. The Idea of it is very neat and the setting is, to begin with, very interesting. The problem is that after an hour or so you have already figured out every plot twist and turn that the game will hold in store for you and every character you meet is completely forgetable. I perticularly found the main character Altaïr dislikable, which doesn't help considering you have to play as him for the ~10 hour gametime. The fact that he speaks with a clean American accent also takes away from the setting. Now, I do understand that Altaïr is supposed to be Desmond and vice versa because of the Animus, but the accent is just too jarring and out-of-place to fit in properly.The only thing I can really say is that the parkour gamplay is a very good place to start, as a completely new IP. But the more you play, the more you become irritated with huge bugs and glitches and by the end you just want to throw it away.That said though, controlling Altaïr is like a sodding delight compared to controlling the other main character Desmond, who is like steering a massive tank. Which has just shatted it's pants.I am not looking to offend anyone who really liked this game when it came out. Because back then I am sure this was incredible, on the PS3 and X360. But now, 2013 it hasn't aged well at all. That, and the PC port is absolute garbage. On an AMD FX-8350 and an AMD Radeon R9 290 it averages ~30 FPS. (Brotherhood constantly stays over 60)Now, should you play it?If you would like experience it on it own merit - No. It's not worth it.If you want to play the entire saga - Maybe, I did it, but I didn't have to because everything that you learn in Assassin's Creed (I) is summed up in a two-minute cutscene at the start of Assassin's Creed II. Which, while it has massive flaws, is a vastly superior game.			"

												Wow, what a mess of a game.  I'm glad that they dramatically improved the series for AC2, but I cannot recommend this unless you want to suffer through the terrible glitches for the story alone. Oh and, consider just quiting the game a mini-game within itself if you decide to punish yourself with this disaster. (Never thought that just quitting a game could lead to an  uncontrollable urge to rage-quit).Warning:Within 5 minutes of starting a new game, you will want to shove that hidden blade up Altair's bum because he is such an absolute pr*ck. Without a doubt, one of the most unlikeable playable characters in gaming history.			"

												This is the story about some guy who is kidnapped by someone else and forced to use the mumble to mumble mumble the memories of mumblemurf for some reason or other. The game doesn't have subtitles. An unfortunate design choice for two reasons.The first reason: Many of the actors(?) haven't quite figured out how to open their mouth while talking.The second reason: talking is pretty much everything that happens in this game.Don't believe the lie about open-world gameplay, parkour moves and total freedom. All I seemed to do in this game was to hold forwards from one dialogue-ridden cutscene to the next. Sure, I had the option of parkouring about the place, but it didn't bring forth feelings of open world movement and pulse-pounding action. Freerunning simply felt like a carrot being dangled over my nose on the other side of a window, designed solely to frustrate me while I wait through another cutscene.Wait seems to be the keyword in this game. The intro in particular is an irritating wait. Intros are to be skipped. We see them the first time, and then we skip past them because we've already seen them. But no. The developers don't care about me wanting to play a game, they've got religious nutters to placate, leaving me to tap the escape-button with no real hope of being let into the game any time soon.Still, if you've got good hearing, a high tolerance for tricky control schemes, and a genuine interest in Mumblemurf's backstory, I'm sure the game is good.

												I've owned this game since 2008 (on Xbox 360) but never got a chance to actually play it till today! 2/4/2014The story is awesome! I really didn't know what to expect beyond some story about an Assassin but man I was pretty surprised. For the first few minutes I had to remap the keybindings for my controller which were really off.. but once I got into the game I was really taken for a ride. I've only played this game for a little over 5 hours but one of the best things I like about this game is the exploration and freerunning. Climbing towers and exploring ancient cities. There are many sidequests and the element of danger was definitely there. Crowds of people walking all over the place. Rub shoulders with the wrong guy and you're in for a fight buddy!The combat feels pretty good at this stage of only playing 5 hours into the game. After completing a few missions I unlocked some abilities like Counter Attack that made combat more in my favor.. or that's what I thought until I ran into a Knight that totally kicked my rear end. But you know whats cool? I grabbed that Knight's attention, climbed a tower, he followed up after me planning on destroying my face, but the moment he stepped off that ladder... I threw him off that tower to his death! Splat my good Sir! Sweet revenge after dying a few times to his brutal power.Again I've only played a few hours into the game earlier today, but I've had a blast so far. It's definitely a great Action/Adventure type of game, I'll be talking about this older game to some of my friends next week for sure! Haha			"

												I am utterly baffled as to why there is so much nostalgia and love for this game. It is, of all the Assassin's Creed games, the most unpolished, glitchy and baldly unplayable. Considering most of the other games are rather mediocre, and that this is the worst of them, this praise, again, astounds me.I have heard praises heaped upon this game for it's narrative, for it's gameplay mechanics, and for it's primary protagonist. All 3 of these points fall flat when put to scrutiny.Let us look first at the narrative. I will spoil it, though for such a inane and so ideologically uninteresting of a story, one could hardly spoil it. The structure of the narrative revolves around a process of reclaiming your character's honor and position within the Assassin Order after they disgraced themselves by betraying the creed's 3 tenets.To this end, you eliminate 9 targets, learning of a templar conspiracy. As you take them out, the assassin versus templar conflict becomes clear. Both the assassins and templars are secular humanists, so to speak. They both recognize religion, God, spiritual belief, philosophy, morality, and universal truths to be illusions manufactured by man.Their difference is in the conclusions they come to from this recognition. The assassins seem to advocate liberty, that they would dispel the illusions, that they trust humanity with this. They think human nature good enough to find it's own truths without the illusions. So, freedom is their ideal.The templars would not dispel the illusion, fearing the chaos that would come from it. They would maintain the illusion that they might maintain order. In fact, they would strengthen the existing hierarchies, religions, and authorities so they might further build an order to which all men serve. A new world order.There's some sci-fi garbage somewhere in there revolving around a race who came before and how they or their artifacts manufactured all the various miracles and religious events throughout history. Whatever, it's abysmal at best.It comes to pass that the templars you are eliminating are part of the same order as the assassin's mentor, Al Mualim, is also a templar, and was using you to kill the other leaders of the order so he would be free of any obligation to share power. This is the same narrative twist we see used in a couple other, hugely superior games. In Star Wars, Knights of the Old Republic, a long chain of side quests where you work for elite bounty hunters known as the genoharadan -- the same form of twist is used. In The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, the Dark Brotherhood questline concludes with a series of contracts that ends in a similar twist as well.The conclusion we should make here is simply that the same sort of narrative has been told before with more interesting characters, conflicts, moral questions, and acceptable gameplay mechanics -- all things Assassin's Creed lacks.As for the main protagonist, let us discuss the glorious, nuanced character of Altair that receives so much praise. Great lines of dialogue delivered in a monotone, flat, American accent -- Altair is, one would infer, Middle-Eastern. Seriously just listen to some of the lines he delivers, the voice acting is hilariously terrible. The character in the beginning so obviously set up for an arrogant-character-is-humbled-and-has-to-rediscover-honor-and-self cliche it's unbearable waiting for it to happen.The gameplay mechanics are the most unnacceptable features of the game. Combat is slow, awkward and frustrating. Climbing and physics are beyond stupid. Gravity in the 1st game works like this: jump off building, fall normally for 10 feet or so, stop completely midair and resume falling but instead straight down, no matter the trajectory you had originally.Missions structure is the same literally every time. Do around 3 investigations upon entering a city, consisting of folllowing someone and beating them up, eavesdropping, or doing race or assassination minigames. This is supposedly to gather information on your target. In practice it seems useless, as every assassination seems a wholly scripted event, the investigations just repetitive and unneeded hoops/filler the game forces the player through to advance the shoddy story.Glitches are, of course, prominent and further make the game a frustrating and difficult experience to push through.Please don't play this game. While none of the Assassin's Creed games are great, any other game in the series is preferable to this one.			"

												This is the most inconsistently frustrating game I've played all year. The game seems designed to make you think it has quality and then it punches you in the face with annoying NPCs and redundant quests that have nothing to do with the sparse primary storyline. I'm bailing on it half-way through. I have better, less frustratingly annoying games yet to start. That, and my cursing at the screen has my wife concerned for my physchological state. Seriously? I know people swear by this series, and I purchased several titles in the series on super-sale a while ago; but I think I'm putting this in my ""I hate the Game Mechanics"" library category. I'll watch the YouTube ""Let's Play"" to finish the primary story. This game has way to much grinding and struggling with swooping camera struggles for my taste.			"

												The first part of the famous stealth action-adventure series. It laid out strong foundations for the following games but sadly can't stand on its own.Pros* The scenario show the Templars as ambiguous enemies rather than just as evil monsters* Many historical characters are involved and you can visit culturally-important places like the Great Mosque of Damascus* Videogame elements such as checkpoints and regenerating life are interestingly part of the story* The graphics are still strong for a game that was released in 2008Cons* The PC port is awful - you can't exit the game quickly, game-breaking crashes will happen several time and an option to display subtitles is lacking* The handling is poor and too often you will die or be spotted due to the game not registering correctly your intentions* Extremely repetitive gameplay and the bizarre need to fill the ending with combatIt's sad but the game is really just a tech demo for the rest of the series. Assassin's Creed is extremely frustrating, which is a shame considering the story is good and taking place in such an underrepresented setting.			"

												The game could be much better if there would be no combat and less towers. Gameplay becomes repetative after two cities - climb the tower, find the objective, RUN FROM THE GUARDS, kill the target, go to the bureau and move onto the next target. Free-run is pretty cool, climbing animations are smooth. However the climbing process is so simplified that it becomes boring pretty soon. Guards everywhere disrupt the running pretty often and sometimes it is VERY ANNOYING. By some reason regular people (not guards) may throw rocks at you while you are climbing - a person who gave them that ability must be fired. It seems that it was forbidden to drive the horse fast back in these days - the police will chase you if you break the speed limit (stealing horses is still fine). A wast amount of collectibles (420 flags and 60 tampliers) is useless - there is no reward for collecting them.Combat is horrible - there is no lock-on so you will change your target every time you move the mouse. You can avoid fighting till memory block 6 when you'll be forced to kill a small army (and this is not how the True Assassins™ do). Seriously, it is frustrating to fight more than two persons.Sound is good, graphics are fine, story exists. The game is playable, but is far from perfect assassin simulator. Get it on sale, play till the sixth block and then uninstall.			"

												If you're searching for an assassin game, this is not the game you search for, better check out Dishonored or Hitman or even Shadow of Mordor.Assassin's Creed is a one-man-army action game with bad voice acting, strange controls, horrible camera movement, repetitive character and world design, boring missions, hundreds of (useless) collectibles and a nice setting where you're facing 20 enemies at once and still win.Some other ""features"" like fixed aspect ratio (black borders on top and bottom if you don't have a 16:9 monitor), no subtitles, no regular saves or the need to press 10+ buttons just to quit the game round this terrible package.I have no idea how this franchise could become so popular.Don't buy it.

If you want to start with the franchise I would recommend one of the ezio games or black flag. The gameplay seems very repetitive now and hasn't aged well compared to the other titles.

												It's good, really, but...It's fun to start off with, but it gets unbelievably repetitive way before the end. The mission types repeat and repeat and repeat, and one (eavesdropping) doesn't even involve gameplay. Climbing viewpoints gets tedious most quickly, and there are (by my count) 91 of them in the game. Some aren't that high, but some are these ridiculous towers it takes probably well over a minute to climb, sync and dive from.The free running feels good, except when you randomly stop climbing or you randomly fail to jump to or grab something or it just doesn't respond properly in the heat of the moment.The combat is alright, but it doesn't really make sense that when you're surrounded by enemies, only one attacks you at any given time.The graphics are still decent, but even with the highest settings there's heavy LOD-popping going on as you roam around, especially in 'the kingdom', the area in between the key cities. And the shadow resolution drops, jarringly, for anything further than a few metres from you. People even popped into existence before my eyes once or twice. You do get to ride a horse through the kingdom though, which is strangely satisfying.The story is alright but the most interesting part is the 'present day' stuff, which really doesn't tell a proper story, more like the first couple of chapters. Oh and you know what's the most annoying? The drunks, beggars and deranged who annoy the absolute shitzu out of you any time you're on street level.So... I strongly suggest watching the cutscenes on YouTube and skipping right to the second game, unless you're the neurotic type who feels compelled to play through all of them (like me). But if that's the case, play in short bursts and definitely don't waste your time trying to collect the hundreds of flags scattered through the game. There's no fun to be had doing that, and not even any pointless achievements.Also, the game has no subtitles whatsoever.			"

It's cool hoppping and climbing around like a ♥♥♥♥in' monkey, but the gameplay is so repetitive, the environment is frustratingly similar everywhere you go, and the combat is really pretty boring for how often you get stuck in it. Fleeing was fun the first couple times, but then it just got tedious what with Altair 'tarding out and climbing up♥♥♥♥♥♥I didn't want him to and causing me to have to run another marathon to find somewhere else to hide.And I can't tell you how many times I actually threw my hands up in frustration at the crazy homeless guys shoving me into guards.

												The game completely and utterly sucks. The controls are horrible (M/KB or controller - I played on a controller and they're equally awful), not precise at all when you try to climb on things, most of the time you don't go in the direction you indend or it fails to function properly. In general, climbing plain sucks and when it's one of the main draws of the game, it hurts immensly. Also the little side quests needed to do assassinations are one of a handful of recycled missions throughout the entire game it get repetative very fast. Plus, field of view for enemies is laughibly bad. Additionally combat is boring as hell, unresponsive, and the again the controls suck for that too. With that said, the combat is actually incredibly easy at the same time - have fun countering the entire game and doing nothing else to kill enemies while in the process never getting hit. This game is so repetative, with poor controls, and an incredibly dull main character (all the characters act like cardboard cutouts with no personalities) - not to mention a pretty lame ending. I don't see how anyone in their right mind could like this game. Oh and did I mention a bug that can currupt your savegame at random at any point in your playthrough - that's been present since it was released in 2007? Yeah - enjoy having to delete your save and start from the begining if that happens to you, even if you're 99% through.1/10 - simply because the graphics were decent the year this was released, and it spawned better future Assassin Creed games.I payed $5 for it, it wouldn't even recomoned playing this if it were free for your sanities sake - one of the worst games I have ever played. Luckily, it spawned a good series despite being such a failure. With that said don't let disuade you from the rest of the series. My advice, skip Assassin's Creed 1 read a synopsis on wikipedia and jump striaight in Assassin's Creed 2 - which is actually a good game.			"

												Monotone, boring, downright awful piece of a game, that's how I would describe the first Assassin's Creed entry. The missions are so unbelievably tedious it almost hurts. Fetch some flags here kill couple of random guards who spawn out of your♥♥♥♥♥there, climb a tower to unlock the map now rinse and repeat 50 more times. That pretty much sums up what the game is all about. The story is almost non existent, you're just on your way killing 9 random dudes because they are bad doing bad stuff there is absolutly no motivation whatsoever. The parkour part is partly broken. For some reason Altair keeps jumping in every direction except the one I want him to, he also gets constantly stuck looking at the damn edge of a building which is 10 cm above his head instead of climbing it up. Come on man, you're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ assassin, that's ridiculous! At the end I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, just start with the second entry which is by miles better and offers tons more of content than this piece of garbage.			"

												I really don't understand all the hype around Assassin's Creed franchise. These first one seems like prototype with very many flaws. Only thing that I can really approve is graphics which are pretty good (in respect to release date). Story is so-so, it's good idea poorly executed with bad pacing (it gets better closer to the end). Sound/music is decent but nothing memorable. The biggest problems are emptiness of the world, lack of content and poor and overly simplistic combat. Also, this is a game about assassin's and there is no stealth. And to mention it, controls and camera could use some improvements but they are good enough most of the time. Overall, I am disappointent with first Assassin's Creed game.4,5/10			"

												I cannot even begin to tell you how bad this game is. I bought the first 5 games of series because of the popularity and started with the AC 1. I wanted to start at the beginning of the story. First the game is beyond repitive. You have like say maybee 6 different quests and that's it. It's the same quests over and over and over. Then the maps are the same exact looking areas doing the same exact quests. Oh yea and the game is beyond buggy. It's like playing a crappy beta. The fighting also is atrocious. Even the open world is terrible due to the fact that you can never really run around and you have people literally just block your way every step. I hate this game. I think I won't even play the next 4 AC games I got because I simply hated playing the first one. I quit on memory 6 after i was yelling at my comp bug after bug after bug. Seriously don't waste your time on this garbage. Should of never been released.			"

												One of the most overrated games I've ever played. Parkour is constantly bumbling about. Controls are a mess and unresponsive. Takes Altair like 3 seconds to animate the run motion. So you're a master assasin right? You cant counter until after your first mission. And you don't learn how to DODGE until like 1/2 through the game. ridiculous. Ok so the bureau wants you to be a proper asssassin. So teach me by forcing mini tutorials instead of unlocking ESSENTIAL moves halfway through the game. If I'm an assassin, I expect to be stealthy. Don't be fooled. You CANNOT stealth assassinate any of the targets so far. I'm about half through the game at this point. No ledge kills. No whiste attract. No throwing♥♥♥♥♥♥to distract. WTF. This is NOT a stealth game. The ""game"" barely qualifies as entertainemnt. It's just a parkout simulator with some terrible combat thrown in. I'm literally going to do the minimum from now. This extra intel just isn't compelling and helps very little with the targets. Shadow of Mordor is a FAR better game.After writing this review, I just got more♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ So♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I'm uninstalling.

												Just finished replaying through this game as I have not played it since it was released back in the day on Xbox 360.*****If you have never played Assassin's creed before, this game is a must play. Ignore everything below, as that is written from the POV of someone who has played and completed nearly every game in the entire series, and went back and played this one now on PC. The series was one of the best and most revolutionary ones there were. I wish I could experience them for the first time again.*****As someone who has played every single Assasin's Creed from start to finish, going back and playing this game was painful in terms of the mechanics, camera angles, repetitiveness. The main story-line is still good although repeptitive, and I did enjoy the nostalgia seeing how the series got started in terms of the pieces of eden, abstergo, and desmond.However you are assigned to assassinate a total of 9 people, and before you can kill one of them, you must complete at least 2-3 mini tasks. There are only 3 different mini tasks in the entire game: Pickpocket a random citizen for info, talk to an informant and complete his task, and beat up a random preacher/well-know citizen to get info from them. You do this NINE times. You literally pickpocket, escort/run through city, and fist fight a citizen a total of 25-27 times, and then assasinate a target. (9 main kills, 2-3 mini tasks before each one).Once again want to emphasize if you've never played the series, please get this and play it through, as you're starting one of the best and most successful game franchises of all time. First time played: 9/10Going back years later after playing the whole series: 7/10			"

												I cannot in good confidence recommend this game. Even though the gameplay is solid and fun, the story telling is decent etc (I've played it on Playstation, so don't let the gametime fool you) this game is... glitchy as ♥♥♥♥. This makes Unity look literally flawless. The Unity launch was more stable than this♥♥♥♥♥♥I've died from simple game mechanics on more than one occasion. My favourite one, jumping into a haybale. Sounds like no issue, right? Well, apparently haybales are solid ♥♥♥♥ing blocks of instadeath in this game. On the very first view tower, I jumped down (Did it more than once, mind you) and died. After my corpse fell over, it launched off into the sky.Oh, and the fysics in this are the worst I have ever seen in my entire life. I can jump, suddenly stop mid air, then drop slooowly. If it's too high, I am still gonna die though. Most awkward ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game ever and I really honestly want my £10 back...			"

												My wife wins by playing 30 minutes of this and then never turning it on again. I, on the other hand, am too stubborn for that, so I rode the whole roller coaster. The key to me completing it was that you didn't have to ride the horse to town after the first trip to each one. I think that would have broken me after three awful rides. Everything else is best described as ""the same stuff over and over and over again."" The actual assassinations were somewhat cool with the dialog and set pieces, but there's no way it was worth doing the same investigations nine times to get to them. And then there was the last mission where it turned into an action game with bad combat, since you couldn't stealth at all anymore. Since I already made the potential mistake of dropping a whopping $14 on the deluxe edition of the sequel, I'm sure I'll at least fire it up to see how much they fixed. The one very, very large positive is that without achievements singing the siren song, I made zero attempt to gather the flags. I can't even imagine how much I would have hated this game if I had to get those damn things on top of the rest of the monotony.			"

												How this series managed to take off with such a terrible first installment is beyond me. The plot is hopelessly convoluted, and the game makes you slowly plod through repetitive tasks, working toward an unsatisfying resolution. Combat is the grandaddy of basic whack-a-mole ""Press X to win"" garbage, further dulled down with AI that hurtles back and forth between the two extremes of utter cluelessness and psychic ability. What little challenge this game offers comes from trying to cope with its godawful camera and unintuitive control scheme. Oh, and you can pile random hangs, freezes, and crashing on top of the whole heap. The only things Jade's Game does manage to get right are atmosphere and level design, and while it demonstrates a keen grasp of those two concepts, it's not enough to redeem the project as a whole.

												Didn't like this game when it came out. Still don't. I like the world it sets up for though. The gameplay itself is awful. Controls are clumsy. Character moves frustratingly slow for being some ultra elite acrobatic assassin. Combat is a joke. And the sidequests are copy pasted from GTA III with the cars removed along with any semblence of fun they may have had originally. Now AC II is a different story. It elaborates on the interesting world and fixes most of the horrendous gameplay problems, but that's just it. If AC and AC II were one movie. AC would be the 10 minute prelude that sets up for the actual movie. Except this prelude lasts 15 hours. Basically, if you haven't played AC, but want to play AC. Go look up the plot online for the first game, watch a few youtube videos about it, then go buy AC II. This game was bad when it came out, and the more AC games that come out, the worse this garbage smells.			"

												Game production and graphics are good, but thats about it.The gameplay is repetitive, tasks, combat and locations repeat themselves and get boring very quickly.Biggest downside of the game is the story. The pace, in which it is told, is so slow that you forget why you have to assassinate people and in what way this all impacts on the person in the lab. And when you finally reach the end of the game, to get the story conclusion you will be left alone with a cliffhanger to buy part two of the series. Utterly disappointing and a chore to play through the whole game.			"

The controls are some of the worst I've ever fought with, the gameplay is terrible and repetitive, and the fact that you have to manually crash the game to exit in order to avoid the 5-minute nightmare you'd normally have to go through really tops things off and makes the game more like a bad joke than anything.  It had decent enough graphics, but that's really the only good thing I can say about it.			"

												Perhaps this game was good when first released on consoles, but it hasn't aged well.  It's pretty much the epitome of terrible console port - starting with the menu and exit game mechanism that makes it literally take several minutes to quit unless you press ALT-F4.  Seriously Ubisoft - 6 menus to quit the game?Beyond that, as the game is called Assassin's Creed you would be forgiven for thinking it will be about stealth assassination.  Generally, it's not - very few of the true assassinations in the main plot allow different angles of approach or stealth mechanics.  You would assume an assassin would prefer to avoid doing their work in public, or would prefer to use a handy bow from a nearby roof - you would be wrong, though.  Rather, you are expected to get in close, which inevitably means getting into combat.  That's also a strike - the combat is bloody terrible.  Again, the console port-ness appears, as the combat is typical of other console ports (I'm looking at you, Prince of Persia Sands of Time) and is not at all intuitive for PC players.  Much of it relies on timing moves, which don't appear to register well, and are better suited to a controller.  In fact, the majority of the game is best suited for a controller - or to be watched in a LP rather than played.TL;DR:  For a game that was published well after the Thief series, Deus Ex, and a myriad of others that contain aspects of stealth assassination, they all do it much better than Assassin's Creed.  I bought this for $7 and I drastically overpaid.NOT recommended.			"

												I'm a huge fan of the Assassin's Creed series... except the first one. Really, if you're new, just start playing AC2 instead. You won't be missing much. Especially since the intro cinematic to AC2 covers everything important about AC1's story in about 10 seconds. Every mission in the game is ""kill this guy, because reasons"" and starts out with gathering information, which means doing one of 4 types of sidequest where you can do exciting things like sitting on a bench or following someone into an alley so you can punch them a few times. After you do enough repetitive sidequests you unlock the assassination target's location. Then you kill the guy you're supposed to kill then run and hide. Then do it all again for the next target. Nothing changes about the missions other than the location of your target.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. Perhaps I didn't play it ""right"" or something, but many parts of the game felt like a chore.  Every single mission is exactly the same. As soon as you've seen all three cities, the game is nothing but tedious ""investigation"" quests which consist of finding lame wannabe assassins and doing fetch quests for them. Also peppered throughout the cities are viewpoints, which are actually pretty fun because you have to find ways to climb tall buildings. Then there are the ""rescue citizen"" missions which are so completely out of place it's ridiculous. Sure, let's make the whole game about stealth kills and then force you to fight some guards in the middle of the marketplace in plain view of everyone. Let's also have you do it about 10 times per city. And every citizen has that same canned ""I will repay this kindness I swear it"" line afterwards. The only time this is worthwhile is when you unlock a crowd of scholars to get past some guards. The AI for the guards is absolutely atrocious as well. Just inexcusable. This series got far better with the sequel and the Ezio trilogy. This game feels like a prototype for the series rather than a worthwhile game.			"

Yes it gets very repeatative when you are finding information for each assassination and some of them drove me up the wall but performing that assassination without a problem was just so rewarding. Recomending this game however I just can't do, I love the assassin creed series and I'm always telling people to play them but for PC this was a buggy mess and my DX 10 file would not play so I had to use the DX 9 and that still didnt work perfectly. I recommend you play this on console as it is more stable and less bugs, the graphics might not be up to scratch with the PC but the gameplay will imporve dramatically and less bugs will occurRating 7/10  but as mentioned will play better on consoles			"

												As much as this game had potential to be good, it falls short in way too many areas for me to think its any more than a 6/10. I really wanted to enjoy this game, but theres nothing about this game that goes beyond good. For starters, the controls are unnecessarily complicated. The fact that it takes 2 buttons and WASD to sprint really proves that. The whole high profile low profile aspect of the controls really make the entire thing feel really clunky. This also leaks over into the combat, which I love in concept, but in execution eventually becomes hold down RMB and then spam LMB after theyre done attacking, at least until you get countering. After that, the combat becomes even more of a joke. Parkour doesn't feel satisfying in the slightest, really all you have to do is press ""W"" and RMB and press space when you plateau. All of this gets really repetitive fast with a storyline that reflects 2 boring AAA movies forced together , a main character that almost borders on shadow the hedgehog levels of edge and sci-fi elements that are completely uncalled for. I really wanted to like♥♥♥♥♥crud, but if I want to play a good open world stealth game, i'd just play Sly Cooper 2 or 3 which does everything this game does better. 6/10 "

												So recently I decided to marathon all the Assassin's Creed games available on PC and 100% complete them. This one I didn't 100% complete but I did do the story and some side stuff. Here are my honest thoughts on just the game itself, if you were to buy it now.Pros:-Interesting story line in and out of the Animus.-Combat can be quite satisfactory and challenging.-Is not too easy.-The locations are quite cool and interesting.-Desmond.Cons:-Graphics are very outdated which is unsurprising seeing as how old it is.-Gameplay is very repetitive (do some spying then kill your target). 9 times.-Freerunning is quite slow and clunky, but not too bad.-Cutscenes are very dull, boring and overwinded.-Voice acting isn't great especially from Altair.-Altair is quite a boring character with no spirit.-Being stealthy is very dull, pointless and sometimes very hard.Overall, if you want to have some fun with a one off game then DO NOT BUY THIS, unless maybe it's on sale. There are much funner games for £10. If, however, you want to start the AC games from the beginning and understand it all like me then buy it, but do know IT IS NOT NEEDED! You can easily start from AC 2 and not really miss much as that is a much better game!			"

												Assassin's Creed is the quaintessential Ubisoft title - fantastic idea, rushed out before it was finished that leaves you disappointed.There is a core game here, which could be amazing. The idea behind the gameplay mechanics are great, and the free running features are smooth at times. Yet, there's nothing more to it. It's essentially a tech-demo.I'm informed that the other Assassin's Creed games are MUCH better, and have a better storyline, and don't have you repeating the game over at the halfway point ala the first Assassin's Creed. If that's the case I look forward to the other Assassin Creed titles.I originally played this game on the 360 when it was initially released. My hype was high and expectations were perhaps uncontrolable. I remember getting into an argument with the Ubisoft rep who would come into our store about how crap the game was. He wasn't too happy that I wasn't going to shill it hard to people. However, the first one is stale and undercooked at the same time. The crashes to desktop are beyond frustrating. DX10 version is unstable and unsupported. The DX9 version strangely runs smoother. I get the impression it's the Steam interface which causes the crashes. Overall, I'd suggest watching the story on youtube and jumping on (hopefully) the much improved Assassin's Creed II or Brotherhood. The first game is everything that is currently wrong with Ubisoft:Full of BugsRepeated pointless gameplayCollect 100 lots of 100 different itemsPromises and hopes that never live up to the expectationAll of this distracts from what COULD be a really great game.

												Picked up Assassin's Creed: Director's Cut during a Steam sale as I never played any game of the franchise before. I had high expectations due to the popularity of the franchise. At the beginning you get blown away by the detailed graphics and the openness of the world. You started digging into the combat mechanics, enjoy your stealthy kills and exploring every hidden city corner. But after a few missions, the repetitiveness of it all becomes quite apparent: always the same mini missions, always the same chain of events, the open world where you can do... nothing. Yet another few missions later and you are wondering why you are wasting your time on this... Boredom changes into irritation once you find out that you really don't need to be stealthy nor do you need to explore everything or finish every mini mission. And then I didn't even mention the excruciating game menu, the crappy ending, the poorly scripted conversations (no, there is no escape button). Quickly I didn't feel any sympathy for the main character and the unfolding story. What a missed opportunity this game is... Even at sale, I would not recommend this game.Score: 4/10Pro:+ visuals+ open world+ climbing towers and enjoying great viewsContra:- empty world- repetitive missions- clumsy controls on pc- painful game menu system- irritating camera system			"

												There are three words that can describe this game perfectly.Mind-numbing tedium.Everything gets absurdly repetitive after the tutorial - ""climb towers, interrogate/pickpocket, run from guards, kill a guy, run some more"". The world and its characters are bland and uninspired, the combat is a chore, the controls are annoying and collecting clues is about as exciting as playing PacMan... without monsters.To top it off, there are *no* subtitles, and considering that the characters talk like bumbling idiots more often than not, good luck understanding what's going on.Just... don't.

												What happened to the PC port? I remember playing this game on Xbox when it came out. It was a great game. I loved being an assasin. But the bugs are so...Arrrgh! I would not recomend buying this game cause it just won't run on a computer. The console (to my great disatisfaction) is where this game belongs. If you are trying to understand the AC universe, I get it that you want to play the first game, but take it somewhere else. It won't run on your PC and there is nothing you can do about that. I wish you the best of luck.BUT! This is the game to play if you want to know where Altiar came from, just remember you have to climb the mountain every, single, time.			"

												SO this game obviously created quite a legacy and there's no denying that. It offers a unique perspective on the period of time surrounding the crusades while providing some enjoyable gameplay elements. Unfortunately, this game has many flaws (all of which have been corrected in later games in the series. The initial segments of the game are fun as you explore the world and acclamate to the gameplay mechanics. However, shortly after, you realize you have to do the same thing again. and again. and again. This game gets boring fast, and while the high-level assassinations can be unique, the long periods in between leavemuch to be desired. Additionally, the lack of steam acheivments renders the collecting of flags and the murder of templars pointless, and doing so unlocks no in-game features. The games that would follw this one are spectacular, but I would be lying if I said I really enjoyed this entry in the series. 3/10			"

												A very disappointing game.This is the 3rd game I bought on Steam many years ago (2009) and had technical difficulties on my old PC so I left it on the backburner since.I finally got to play it past the tutorial and it was okay.Then I went for the second prey and it was the same. Then the 3rd prey...still the same.Finally the 4th prey...still no change.It's always go there and climb all towers to get the map, do at least 1 activity then report to the bureau for some useless idle talk and finally hunt the target.Controls are not great, characters not particularly interesting and the present time scenes are barely useful, especially considering how slow it all is.In the end, interesting concept with a really nice presentation of its historical setting (a period / place not scene often in games) but terribly repetitive with no real incentive to wander around.

												Boring and repetetive. Its initial shine quickly fades to give room to endless slodging through the same side quests you finish before each one of the nine assassination attempts that you must complete in order to progress through the game. The stealth mechanic is decent, though it oftentimes is undermined by the overall arcadedy feel of the game. Did it only once to experience the story and don't plan to do it ever again. If you plan to tackle this franchise you might as well skip this one, or just watch the story gameplay videos on youtube.			"

												I have issues when it comes to games, I feel like I need to play through entire series to get the storyline even if people say the original ones suck.Everyone told me that the original assassin's creed was one of those games, just to avoid it and move onto 2 but I couldn't do it.. I had to play it.It's a really pretty game, even by current 2014 standards.. but aside from that there's not much else in the way of redeeming features. You'll be doing a couple of things in this game, running around exploring, fighting and doing side quests.All the side quests are the same, there's a million 'save a citizen' quests that just involve fighting some guards and then getting one of three canned replies from the person you rescued.. there's no variation in conversation.. by the end of the game you'll have heard a million other people say the same lines whenever you start to climb anything or knock anything over.Climbing / freerunning is the other big thing, but it feels a bit gimmicky in the game, there's very little reason to use it other than the game forcing you to use it to explore areas by getting to vantage points.By the end of the game I was using it for that purpose and just to get places quite far away quickly, everything else was easier to just stay on the ground in my opinion.Combat itself isn't fluid and locks away most of your combat moves until you progress the game, which makes combat start out clumsy and boring and ends up the same way as every combat move you get is defensive in nature, the entire combat system boils down to defending and counterattacking.. there's never any storming in and killing everyone like a badass.. there's storming and and defending yourself until everyone dies which just does not have the same feeling at all.Even the ending just really truly sucks, I don't want to put up any spoilers but it's one of the most dissapointing experiences I've had finishing a game.The entire game is repititous and feels extremely grindy, by the end I was putting it on for an hour and then turning it off because it just felt like work.. unless you have the same issue as me and need to see the game yourself for the storyline before moving onto the next, then honestly skip this game. It's not awful, but it's absolutely not fun.			"

												This is not a game that stands the test of time at all. It has nostalgia factor but playing through it today only serves to make me realize how far the series has come in terms of pure playability. AC has never been known for great combat, but this game has combat you'll avoid at all times because it will make you impatient. Waiting ten seconds for enemies to hit you is not tense, it's an annoying filler task that serves to make the game boring.The climbing is also very problematic, Altair will get stuck on things for absolutely no reason forcing you to drop and then try climbing all over again. The game also places a very large emphasis on stealth without having any practical stealth mechanics. The mission structure was cool in theory but it's poorly executed. It gives you no freedom and every assassination is extremely scripted.I'd LOVE LOVE LOVE to see this game updated for the modern audience on say, the Unity engine with better climbing mechanics, combat that doesn't suck and actual open ended assassination and info gathering. As it stands, this game feels like nothing more than the beta for the second game which improved things exponentially (except I was disappointed that the second game went for a less ambitious structure, but considering everything else it fixed I can forgive it).Read up the story of this game on Wikipedia then play the second if you want to get into the series. The reviews may hold this game in high regard, but this was the difficult dark age of 2007.			"

												Honestly, not a fan.  My biggest complaint is that the gameplay is repetitive, predictable, and just generally boring.  Go to area, receive intel by doing generic activities, kill boss.  Lather, rinse, repeat. The controls are fine... sometimes.  Other times, (usually during a chase when it matters the most,) they are frustratingly bad.  And overall, there are a lot of things that just don't make any sense.  For example, every single city guard has no difficulty whatsoever when it comes to climbing walls and jumping from building to building.  They can even keep up with you, the trained assassin.  I understand why it was necessary, (otherwise you would be essentially invincible on rooftops,) but it feels out of place, especially when the rest of the game strives for realism and historical accuracy.This isn't to say that the whole franchise is terrible.  I've already started playing the second game, and it is better in basically every single aspect.  I personally would recommend skipping this game and going straight on to Assassin's Creed II if you are interested in playing the series.			"

												Assassin's Creed™ is the next-gen game developed by Ubisoft Montreal that redefines the action genre. While other games claim to be next-gen with impressive graphics and physics, Assassin's Creed merges technology, game design, theme and emotions into a world where you instigate chaos and become a vulnerable, yet powerful, agent of change. The setting is 1191 AD. The Third Crusade is tearing the Holy Land apart. You, Altair, intend to stop the hostilities by suppressing both sides of the conflict. You are an Assassin, a warrior shrouded in secrecy and feared for your ruthlessness. Your actions can throw your immediate environment into chaos, and your existence will shape events during this pivotal moment in history.			"

												I would've never guessed this was the game that spawned a big-budget annual series.  It's just so boring.  Even simple things like loading up the game are needlessly long and dull.  Start game, pick load save, get sent to some lab in the present day, pick load game, and then you're finally in the portion of the game you want to play.  What the hell.  It's the same process for quitting the game, so you're better just manually shutting it down to save yourself the time.From the 90-120 minutes I played, there was very little action and what there was was poorly executed, and I've read it's just more the same as the game continues.  There was also a lot of boring cut-scenes for the short amount I played the game.  Didn't care for how it handled with either mouse/keyboard or with a controller.  Action events like fighting, sneaking, moving around were blah as well.I disliked this game so much that it soured me on bothering with the series as a whole despite already having a free copy of Black Flag, which is supposedly a good game.  I just can't get over how poor this was in everything outside the graphics department.			"

												I play AC2, ACB and ACR before this and have to say that is was a disappointment. I get it's the first game it needed work but really doing the same thing over and over again and again. If it wasn't for my OCD I would have never finished this. Get the spark notes, skip this game and go to AC2. Almost nothing but the ending has any real meaning anyway.			"

												This, right here, is an example of a bad port. It plays great on the X360, even if the controls take a little getting used to. But on the PC? It's just plain unintuitive. Half the time I played it with a remote, I had to use my mouse and controller anyway because the program decided ""Not today.""Also, I got Shadow of Mordor after playing this  and  Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag. Shadow of Mordor is a far superior game to both in my mind. The combat feels better, the atmosphere is more clear in where it wants to be, and the story feels like more of an assassin game. Assassin's Creed feels more like ""Pride's Blunder: Climb Back Up the Ranks""			"

												Let me give you a little insight into how I organize my steam games. I've got a folder for multiplayer games; that should be self explanatory. I've got a folder for currently installed games; that also is self explanatory. There's a folder for games I wish to play, a folder for games that I may play at some point, a folder for games I won't ever play that mostly consist of the extra, unwanted humble bundle games, and then there's the last folder. This folder is called ""Absolute Garbage Full of♥♥♥♥♥"" There are only two games in this folder, two games that are the worst of humanity and deserve nothing more than to be displayed in Museums where they display rotten games. One game is Deus Ex: Invisible War, the game that marked Ion Storm's downfall as they pandered to consoles, much like Crytek. The other is Assassin's Creed.Don't get me wrong, the Assassin's Creed series is not a terrible one, or so I've been told. I have only played this one and Assassin's Creed 3. I did not like Assassin's Creed 3, but dear god does it fail in comparison to this piece of flaky bull. You start out with a rather interesting concept of a story; you're in a laboratory undergoing a simulation to relate to your knife-oriented ancestors in some plot involving Templars. You go through an intro with some heavy fighting and you're thinking ""Oh, okay, this definitely is not a stealth game. This is a hack n slash."" But whatever right? You suppose it can still be fun, right? Wrong, ♥♥♥♥ you. You get these awful controls and repitive combat that make you yearn to go play with a toaster; at the very least the toaster would be responsive to controls. But whatever, again, you think, who cares if the combat is boring? I'm in it for the raw gameplay. Parkour man. Doing side quests. Story!Well, I'll give you that. Parkour is enjoyable. The wall climbing feels satisfying when you scale insurmountable heights leading up to the conclusion of a bird's nest at the peak of a city. But that's really the only thing it has going for it. When you enter a city, the side quests are by far the most boring, repititve, garbage nonsense that half the time doesn't even make sense. Why am I capturing flags? Why is there a time limit? I'm a trained assassin, not a crazed blue coin collector. There's tons of people being harassed and you can intervene, but why? You're told you're supposed to blend in, not ostracize yourself. Even if they did make sense, they're so senselessly boring the second time around that you do any of them.But hey, there's no uPlay.			"

												This game tho.......This game defines what it is to f*ck up an AC game! (It's the first one, but still!) Have played pretty much every AC game there is, then I bought this on sale just to try it out, and man I regret using my poor money on this sh*tload of f*ck! The game is so repetitive, and the enemies can sometimes be so hard to kill, that you are probably better off trying to eat your own sh*t, then sh*t that sh*t out of your @ss, only to suck the sh*t up your @ss again and puke the sh*t on to your monitor (probably how they made this game). I promiz man, if you only like the plot, then I guess this is an OK game for you (if you like to farm for 7 hours). The only reason I managed to beat this game was by using Cheat Engine (#Promotion). I gave myself infinite health so that I never died. Still took ♥♥♥♥ing forever to kill the f*ckers in the game. All in all this game is Big Rigs quality, the gameplay is sh*t! The story is sh*t!#Spoilers: Don't trust people that looks like they work for the f*cking Al Quaida, obviously the old f*cker betrays your @ss and you have to kill him. I knew that sh*t all along as I played the game! It's more obvious than 1+1 after going to school for 11 years!Also I KNOW that this review will get lots of hate. Therefore my message to you: ""Go f*ck yourself, eat sh*t, and jump in the river like Altair, just without respawning!""			"

												I love the premise of the game. I liked the setting and the story. I got to Damascus before I gave up. Not because it was hard, but because the port for this game is so hilariously bad that it's ruining the whole experience. No crashes, nothing like that for me. But for the tutorial the problems started as soon as the game was supposed to tell me how to sprint. ""Press button 1"". Wth is button 1?! Tried every button I could come up with, nothing worked, went in to control settings and set sprint to shift. Next up was ""button 0"". Same procedure. And the mouse isn't even included in the game?! You can't set any of the controls to mouse buttons. So now I'm fighting with Ctrl. What the actual ♥♥♥♥? Oh, and you can't exit the game without force quitting it. When you click ""Exit game"" you end up with a classic console starting screen with ""Press any button"" written over it. When I press any button I get to select profile. So the only way to quit the game is to Tab-Alt to desktop and then force quit it. Lovely.			"

												I never understood the hype about this game.And having played it for a bit now, I still don't get it.It is bad. Sooooo bad.Repetitive to the extreme. Unintuitive.Bad combat ""system"".Boring, copy-paste side missions.The main missions aren't any better.Copy-paste all the way through.Half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥stealth aspect - if you can even call it that.Why do you play an assassin and then go out and attack every victim in plain sight of the whole damn city?Why can't you stealth kill someone, poison him maybe or murder him in his sleep? Anything would be better than what amounts to basically a full frontal attack.Why do you have to crawl between the cities? Why do the guards/knights attack you immediatly just because you let your horse galopp a bit? The journey between cities is pointless enough as it is, why do I have to do it in the slowest speed possible? To pad out the game's length...Why do I have to do the exact same thing in every frickin city? Like hide with the monks and super-slowly walk into the city ...Probably just to pad out the run-time of the game.The cities and the countryside are severly under-used.There is no point really in exploring in this game - except if you want the achievements.And, man, getting the achievements in this game really feels like a chore; something terrible like cleaning a public toilet with your tongue - it doesn't matter how fast or how slow you do it, you'll still end up with a mouth full of♥♥♥♥♥♥Apparently, you can only climb up towers. You cannot climb down but must jump down into a haystack? WTF?There are so many aspects that could have been good but simply weren't used well.The undecover ability apparently only lets you blend in with monks/scholars (because you simply cannot chang your kick♥♥♥♥♥clothes)The stealth ability isn't really there. No sneaking up to someone and backstabbing them. Or really using your surroundings to attack your victim.The cities could have been really fleshed out with enterable houses (alternative routes), with NPCs that actually give you actual, useful information. And  alternative ways to eliminate the targets.The parts out of VR are just tedious because your character is walking even slower, if that's even possible. And you have to crawl to certain points in the lab where you are to progress the story. Why? I haven't the faintest. Well, otherwise the game won't proceed ...			"

												The first thing you will notice are the vastly outdated graphics, which just hurt your eyes and are nothing like the trailers and the screenshots. Everything is downgraded as usual. However, this is not the biggest of surprises in the game industry these days, so in my generosity, it can be forgiven.What I and many others fail to understand is the concept of the game, for it simply isnt very well thought out before put into use. This is very obvious when you really start to understand the gameplay and try to execute the things you observe the game showing you, which eventually feels clunky, outdated and sometimes, unfortunately, even flat-out depressing. Gameplay-wise, the game holds your hand almost all the time and it becomes really annoying, when you start to notice you have no real difference in the course of action. There are moments where you just feel completely lost and get annoyed at how everything doesnt quite fit together. The controls dont feel fluid at all, and occasionally you feel like you're either stuck in the mud or glue, or the game intentionally was made hard and frustrating to control. Why would anyone want to offer the players of their game an experience like this? And what's really frustrating are the sounds. It's like someone literally wanted to hire one of the worst composers, voice actors and the sound designers for this kind of a game! Could it be simply a bad decision from the lead of this project or very, very dark humor from the entire team of the game developers? You decide!And dont even get me started on the AI. It's rather non-existent. Some games are famous for their silly bot-AI that keeps doing mistakes and failing at the only thing it was designed to do. The only difference between those games and this is that the AI here isn't even funny. It just wants to make you shout at it's actions in utter rage. The performance of the game tends to be lackluster. Ive seen it perform badly on many different specs and machines, which cannot garner much respect, but at this point it doesn't really surprise, either.All this could be fixed with at least a long, interesting story that would give content for your money and/or time, but it doesn't really offer either. When you thought it couldn't get any worse, the game has more bugs here and there, hindering your already non-existent progressing and sucking the last drops of joy out of the experienceOn top of all of this, the game is insanely difficult to progress in. Everything has been made non-intuitive for the average gamer, to the point even hardcore difficulty masochists will find it unpleasant to experience. It all makes you think: Where is the gaming industry heading these days? "

												I tried to like it, but I'm constantly wrestling with controls, camera, and missing features modern games have (like fast travel, for example).Controls are idiotic. You have to hold three damn keys just to sprint. Climbing things isn't too fun either, because the guy is really slow doing it and often he can't reach to climb and it takes you a second to realize that, because of his slowness. When you run to an edge of something, you just ""stare"" down instead of jumping or doing anything sensible. You have to press ""other hand"" control. The reason for the mess with the controls is 'cause you have ""low profile"" and ""high profile"" modes. The low-profile mode is annoying as hell, however, because you move around like a snail. Same goes for some places like the Abstergo lab or some buildings: you can't sprint, you can only ""walk"" which takes forever.Speaking of profiles, you have to actually use a horse to move around cities. I searched around whether there's a fast travel mode, and apparently there is, but not in all the places and you have to get to the edge of the map or something. Annoying. This means if you want to move at any appreciable speed, you have to ""gallop"" in high profile mode which, for some reason, makes every random dude with a sword want to kill you.Now, you may think me being on a horse and the dudes being on foot... I can just run away! What's the problem then? Well, the problem is one of the more annoying features of the game: the detection meter. Whoever thought it was an awesome idea for it to loudly beep should be fired. So, it beeps if you're in an area where you might get attacked. If you get detected, it starts to beep even louder. And if you run away? Hell, that thing will beep forever! You actually have to find a bush somewhere and jump into the bush and sit there for a minute just to shut that stupid beeper off—no other reason; there's no one chasing you any more!So for the last three hours, I feel like I've done nothing but wrestle with controls and get annoyed with the damned beeper.As for the story, well, it may be a good one, but I already dislike the guy I'm playing as. He's a rebel in one sentence and submissive in another. He's all over the place and I don't want to be him.I don't recommend this outdated game.			"

												frankly, the first title does not live upto the sequel which is very rare in any media franchise. Ubisoft wasted their great resources yet again. The concept is unique and very impressive in many aspects, but the excution is poorly done. Though, I'm glad they actually revived it in the sequel, but I wanted to warn others if they thought the first title has a value of the sequel. In a short term, the experience is very repetitive and the traveling is very time consuming. Battle mechanic is difficult to handle, and the objectives are pretty much the same from other maps. Not much of variation in design. Unskippable cut scenes are one of the agony to endure. In other locations, they set up the same camera perspectives while listening to yadi-yadi-yada. Story itself begins with great impression and ends with disappointment. I really wish the title should have kept in the past time line not the present.			"

												Assassins Creed is a good example of good concepts that were completely overshadowed by repetitiveness. In assassin’s creed you will hop across and climb buildings as if gravity doesn’t exist, you will fall from the sky to assassinate your enemies like a badass. Yet when it comes to water, you’ll drown every single time. The interface, graphics, and controls scream console port, but it’s still far from being impossible to play or enjoy. The game became super bland and boring sometime after your second assassination, the game has the same routine for every city assassination. Climb buildings, eagle view, “beat people, steal, or race around town for information”, and then finally kill your target. The storyline is slightly above average with an ok ending but the awfully repetitive gameplay may bore you to the point of quitting before it’s even over. This game sets the foundation for all future AC game; you might want to play this if you’re interested in the series.			"

												   This game is unplayable for the most part due to crashes (Win 7).    I've tried all the fixes, and all the usual nonsense, and I'm lucky to get 30 minutes of continuous gameplay before it crashes.    Given that it's a typical PC port, getting in and out of this game and bypassing cut scenes makes the scenario of it crashing unbearable.   Fixes/nonsense tried:* DX10 Vista compatibility mode:   Didn't fix crashing.* Normal DX9/DX10:  Didn't fix crashing.* acii_360_wireless driver fix:   This did fix the controller mapping, imagine it will for AC II as well.* All fixes tried with disabling multiple displays:   Didn't fix crashing. If you really want to play this game, I'd suggest snagging it on console (if you have that luxury).    Steam should refund anyone who has experienced the level of crashing/nonsense associated with this game. "

												In Assassin's Creed you play as Desmond Miles, who get's kidnapped by Abstergo and shoved into what is called an Animus. This machine allows the user to revisit there ancestors past and view it how it actually happened. The reason Abstergo kidnapped Desmond in particular is because his ancestor Altair knows where 'The Pieces of Eden' are. The Pieces of Eden are powerful objects that were created by 'The one's that came before' and Abstergo wants them to rule the world.Pros:- Interesting Story- Fun GameplayCons:- Repetitive Nature- Lack of Character Progression- Open World that's not so open			"

												It's the first Assassin's Creed and it was very innovative for it's time, but unlike all following parts it's lacking a lot of variety: it's repetitive and the story feels boring and bland. Out of all major AC-games, this is the only one I wouldn't recommend because it's not as fun as the rest of the series.If you want to play it for the sake of beating all parts or because you want to experience the story yourself: go ahead!I can't recommend it however due to it being a really boring game that I didn't enjoy playing.

												In this game, you play as a Syrian man named Altair Ibn-La-Ahad, and he is part of an order of Assassins (hence the name Assassin's Creed). You start the game in real time, as a man named Desmond who has been taken by a company known as Abstergo Industries, a company where they are secretly part of the order of the Knight's Templars. The Templars are enemies to Assassins, and since Desmond is an ancestor of the previously meantioned assassin Altair, the head executive and his assistant Lucy put Desmond into a machine called the Animus. The Animus lets a person delve into his ancestor's memories, and since Altair is an ancestor to Desmond, the executive (i forgot his name, but lets just call him Bill) puts you into the Animus so he can monitor Altair's memories and find a secret that the Templars need that only Altair know. Once you are in the Animus, you finally play as Altair. You start in a mine looking for a Templar named Roberto, and once you find him, you see he is planning to steal the holy artifact known as the Ark of Covenant. You fail to kill him, and your other Assassins are left to kill him (one of them fails by the way). You go back to your master, Al Mualim, and he finds out about the attack. Suddenly Roberto and his fellow Templars are attacking, and you send a diversion to help. After you send the diversion, they flee, and Al Mualim punishes you because you did not remember the three strict rules to being an Assassin in the earlier mission. He stabs you, and you pass out. You are still alive and you must kill 9 other Templars to redeem yourself and be one of the master Assassins again.The game is overall very good, but there are a few things I did not like. First of all, I know it is set in the First Crusades Period (somewhere around 1000 A.D it started) but Altair cannot hold any type of currency. Your gearand weapons are gained from each of the 9 Templars you kill. Also, in the trailer, Altair is seen to have a crossbow as one of his weapons, but that crossbow is nowhere in the actual game, so that got me dissapointed. Another thing is that youdont carry any types of medicine or potions or things like that, which would be useful in fighting because Altair isnt the best fighter without ALL of his weapons. Speaking of health, you dont have an actual health meter. Your health is displayed in something called a Synchronization Bar, a bar that fills as you do good in the game. If you commit crimes, your Synchronization Bar goes down. If you lose fights, it also goes down. Basically, anything bad makes it go down. Those are basically all the problems i have with this game.To wrap it up, Assassin's Creed is a fun game with a really cool and exciting storyline, not alot of  situations i was mad or angry about, but it is old. The graphics are from somewhere around 2000 (i dont know when the games came out by years). So if you dont mind about graphics and want to have a fun action-adventure game with enticing storyline, Assassin's Creed is the game for you.My Rating: 9/10Note from Author: There is stealth in this game. You will have to blend in with crowds, pickpocket without being caught, and if you are caught by a guard or someone you are pickpocketing, you can go blend in by sitting in a bench, hiding in a haystack, blending in with a group of scholars (they look similar to you in clothing), or just running away until they give up. There is a fourth way to blend in, but I forgot it. Another thing in this game is climbing and parkour. You will have to do alot of that, so be prepared.			"

												It's a pretty good game and it introduces some neat mechanics, but it's very unpolished. Considering that the game ends with a “to be continued”, you should play it if you're interested in the franchise as a whole, but I'm not sure how strongly I'd recommend it by itself. It's a great launching point for a franchise and does some cool new things but it does have its flaws.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2011/08/post-launch-reviews-5-assassins-creed.html "

												Fun Game, a bit repetitive and Simple but I like it.The Missions don't give you Money, like in the sequels, but the people thank you, and give you hints about your next big target, I don't know why, but I find that more rewarding than money.It has an interesting story, not the best one but, an interesting one. :)The controls are a bit weird if you've played the sequels before, but for beginners it shouldn't be a problem (except if you're not playing with controller)But it also has its downsides, you can't fast-travel, can't explore the open world after the end of the story and are bound to 1 arsenal of weapons the whole game.I'd recommend this game definetly for all Assassin's Creed Fans and those, who want to become one.But if you're just looking for a Game, that you wan't to play for a long time, you should better take a look at the sequels. :)			"

												Slightly hampered by a fussy camera and some rough edges around the graphics, this is still a great game. Towns and cities feel alive, the combat and free-running is relatively fluid and mostly good fun, and Altair makes a decent character to play as.It's still worth playing as the story is well-developed and keeps you going, and the gameplay is rewarding when it all works. The second game may still be the best, but this is by no means a poor second place.			"

												I played this game back in 2008, so before the second game had been released. It was pretty damn great then, but now its age really shows. The only thing that's like I remember is the combat, which is somewhat difficult at times. Air assassinations are possible but annoying (want to kill a civillian? here's your chance), stealth is almost nonexistent, and climbing things turns out to be a chore, as Altair takes forever to make his way up buildings.Side quest? What are those? Each time you go to one of the 3 major cities, you have to investigate your target. This comes down to repetitive side quests involving pick pocketing, beating people up for information, eavesdropping, and some other silly missions like collecting flags or killing archers. There's no variety, and you can't cut to the chase (most of them have annoying cutscenes). By the time I was on the last few assassinations, I was doing as little as possible to get through the game. There was no reason to complete everything aside from lengthening your time with the game.The plot and the characters inside the Animus are also very forgettable. Who are these people I'm killing? Why am I killing them? Oh, they're templars. Well that makes sense. But who ARE they? I don't remember any of the names of the 9 people I was tasked to kill aside from the ""big bad"", Robert de Sable. The game doesn't make it a point to try and make the characters memorable. Altair is a bland protagonist. His arrogance is frustrating and his decisions make no sense sometimes, or at least he rarely justifies them. His ""growth"" is only shown in one scene where he reiterates what he was told at the beginning of the game about the Creed. His voice acting also sucks, but that's besides the point.I still recommend this game because it's where the series started, and outside the animus scenes are still interesting. Learning about the fight between the assassins and the templars in the present day, meeting Desmond, etc, are all still worth the time you have to put into the game itself. Will you want to play it again anytime soon? Probably not. In a few years I'll just use wiki pages to refresh my memory on what's important. Now on to the superior sequel.			"

												The first, and probably worst, in the Assassin's Creed series.When this game first came out people, I included, thought it was revolutionary.  The historical fiction story of an ancient battle between the assassins and templars that draws ties to present day conflicts, the philisophical conflicts brought forth between both sides, and of course, the free running mechanics.  These story elements were things not seen often outside of traditional RPG's and this may be the first triple A title to do so.  The story was a bit cerebral for such a wide audiance, and some gamers may lose interest, but I was captivated.That said, if you've played any of the instalments since, and you're just coming back to see who this Altair character is, you're probably going to be very disappointed.  Remember all those pointless quests and collectables present in the other games?  Here you will find the most annoying and most pointless examples of said quests and collectables.  Thankfully, there are no achievements for this version, erasing any point of getting most of them in the first place.  The story, while good, is the least interesting, and least weird, of the series so far.  The world is very bland and the cities don't have few landmarks by which to navigate so you will almost constantly be bringing up the map to figure out where to go unless there's a marker for your destination.Overall this is a good game though, and I can't bring myself to not recommend it.  If you're new to the series give it a try, otherwise just take everyone's word for it from the sequels, Altair was awesome at everything.			"

												This is one of the worst games I've ever played.The movement and combat are frustrating due to inconsistant response. Not to mention the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fixed-angle camera that you are forced into using at key events and missions. This retard camera, combined with a lock on all movement during ""story events"", has caused me to get stuck on♥♥♥♥♥♥like walls and headstones, making it impossible to move, and forcing a restart of the mission since I can't move to the next trigger zone because I'm stuck on a wall. This is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but cannot beat the aggravating, ""now I'm yelling and everyone in the house thinks I have a problem"", targeting system, that, I can't quite tell if it locks or not, but will switch targets, and when you are attacked, will lock on, prevent you from fleeing if health is low. Of course this might all be bearable if the story didn't the depth of Dan Brown's 3rd grade picture book written in retardese. (-20/100)			"

												Played it and finish it here's my thoughts:GoodVisuals, looks pretty good, environments are quite expansive and quite immersiveOKGameplay, its not bad but can be extremely frustrating.  I'm thinking this made to be played with a gamepad rather than mouse and keyboard.  Can get stuck with character doing everything other than what you want him to, but is also at times quite intuitive and it's not really a controller skills game (like Tomb raider used to be).The missions tend to be quite repetitive, each target has a set of optional sub-missions to do first, well all those sub-missions are the same.As the player it's your job to complete the mission in between the stories, it's not a RPGStory is ok, (No spoilers) some of the key elements I thought were quite apparent right from the start,Not goodNot being able to skip scenes, Lots of slow bits, Saving is weird, not sure how it worked but you can’t save where you want as far as i know and considering you can’t skip scenes it makes it all a bit painful.I'd give game  3/5, just a bit slow, character development a bit week but nice scenery  pretty cool jumping the roof tops of old Jerusalem  "

												Only played around 9 hours so far but is a really awesome game, it feels a little too simplistic and sometimes too easy with instant respawns and if you screw up you can just killl everything with a sword instead of assassin like play so is way too forgiving of mistakes, it feels like a console to PC port game where it has been dumbed down.It can also be a little repetitive.Still a really awesome game and especially for how old it is, is worth the cheap price and one play through atleast.

												The gameplay is pretty fun but the combat is very repetitive, as is the majority of the game which pretty much consists of multiple areas of doing similar things over and over.The plot is quite interesting but seems to have too little spread out over the game. There are times where you don't even really think about the game having a plot since you're too busy just doing the tasks in each area, especially if you try and do them all to get al information and help.Overall the game is still fun to play, I'd give it 7.5/10.

Sometimes you have to figure out what to do next on some missions. (espcially where to climb ect). iv noticed that on both the PS3 and PC the controlls are smooth but unlike the PS3 version none of the cut scenes lag out with horrible sync voice acting which is great.

The whole game is repetition of the same kind of missions, and with it's clunky gameplay and unusual AI, it quickly gets boring. The story is interesting but the long and arduous grind you have to go through is not worth it. The game started feeling like a chore and led me to losing all interest. "

												Worst game in the seriesThe controlls are godawful, the guards have insane difficulty spikes; one minute they're laughably easy and the next they're unkillable. Altair's voice acting sounds like some unpaid intern just woke up from a deep sleep, and Altair has the personality of a rocking chair with a frownie face drawn on it. The present day story is Much, much more boring compared to the other games. The only reason I bring these up is that people said this was better than the games that came after this. Who could make that conclusion? The guards attack on sight if they see you climbing buildings, gameplay is VERY MONOTONOUS AND BORING. No currency. Beggars are all up in your personal bubble asking for money, and the only way to shut them up is to punch them in the face which upsets guards. Toward the end of the game, it takes a MASSIVE difficulty dive. The investigations are almost uncompletable, since they rely mostly on not being detected. I suppose the best part of the game was that the beginning was kind of good. The story in this one's present day may have sucked, but it started up a great franchise. Off to a bad start, but the rest of the games are really good. Once you swallow the bitter pill that is this game, the payoff, which is the rest of the series, is da bomb diggity, yo.Even with that last part, I just can't recommend this, because you could probably read a synopsis and get what you need to start with AC2.

												This game is way too repetitive.  You will hear the same dialogue, visit the same cities, listen to long-winded dialogue, climb similar buildings and dive into similar hay piles, over and over again.  Also, Altair is probably the worst assassin ever.  There is nothing stealthy about him.  The game says an assassin must be discrete, but the game encourages you to kill scores of guards in the busiest parts of the cities.  It also doesn't make any sense that Altair can't swim.  There are two good parts to this game-The swordfighting looks cool and feels good to control.  But once you get the counter moves, it becomes pretty hard to die.-The parkour/freerunning is fun.I also hate the beggars, theives, the guys with the turbans, and the drunks.  All they do is get in the way.  If you kill one of them, you lose health.  Yet, they can hit you and block your way without punishment.  That is a very poor game mechanic.			"

												Assassins creed has many awesome mechanics and a very interesting story.However, the mechanics mostly fail and the story is extremely predictable.The combat goes from extremely difficult to super easy after the first mission. The freerunning often causes you to jump off random ledges killing yourself, the set up missions are extremely boring and repetative, and the world - being set up in the middle east - looks like a poorly textured sand dune. Here is why I recommend this game: The story, while predictable, is great. Its extremely interesting and it sets up the world fantastically, the side characters are well developed and have strong motivations, and while the set up missions are boring and repetative, the main missions are interesting and pretty solid. Im really hoping that as the series develops the mechanics tighten up and the story continues in a similar fashion, but with less predictablity. The only thing that I would change is I would add a stealth mechanic. The missions could be far more interesting with one.If you are interested in playing I would recommend just doing the minimum amount of set up missions per area and rushing through the game and enjoying the story. Im only a few hours in Assassins Creed 2, but most of my complaints are answered by it so far. I give it a 4/10. Blamo.			"

												This is a relatively old game now and has been overshadowed by the newer AC games, but for a first game of a series it's not bad at all. The background story in the present time with Desmond Miles is a great setup for later games, but unfortunately the story of Altair in the crusades isn't anything special. This is more than made up by the fact that the world is one giant parkour playground and that it actually feels like a real living, breathing world with all the people and their reactions (especially when guards randomly fall from rooftops). Combat needs some work, basically you learn the timing of the counterattack and you can kill anything easily. Altair also failed swimming lessons and dies instantly in the water.Easily recommended, although with how old this game is I would say to wait until it's on sale to pick it up, and preferably as part of a bundle with other AC games.

												You play a character who is playing a character in a virtual reality matrix like mind game which seems to have real world repercussions. Your player characters, player character exceeds expectations in killing and has a really boring side hobby for collecting flags, that do little to enhance the experience. Well I player through the entire game and still don't see the reason for getting these things. Your Player character themselves, exceeds in being able to sleep knowing they will soon be killed (A difficult skill) and they have a vision mode like the light csi use. You mainly play the player characters, player character which is an Assassin. The first 6 hours of the game repeats itself two more times. Sadly about halfway through you stop getting cool stuff to make this grind feel less like a grind. Would it have been too much to ask for a sword that was strong enough to occassionally snap enemies swords in half...The promise of being an assassin is not delivered as it is in games such as Hitman. If you instead think of yourself as a ""Knight""/""Ranger"" or at best ""Rogue"" things make a little more sense. Don't expect to be doing any of the following assassin tricks.* Dripping poison into the mouth a deep sleeping target* Poison capsules in the wine. (Someone does poison wine, but it is not you)* Accidental or false flag death situations* Wearing a disguise* Hiding bodies* Being able to sneak passed the guards of those you are seeking to assassinate without having to take them all head on.. Kind of like a ""Knight"" or a ""Ranger/Rogue""Ball and all an interesting, but drawn out experience, that is drawn out even more by unskippable wordy monologues.You may feel uneasy about the content and religious context if you are impacted by such things, but don't worry, everyone on the team were from different backgrounds, and I believe the game is saying that if they put up with it... So should you.			"

												When I first played this game, I was very disappointed. First of all, I wasn't playing Ezio, which really bugged me because I knew nothing about the other assassins; second, I was VERY confused by the way they incorporated the Animus into the game, and had you switch between history and modern times. And finally, it can be pretty damn frustrating to have to walk across an entire city to simply avoid alerting guards; those cities are huge, man! But after I was about half-way through, I began to appreciate it. Altair is, in fact, a really bad♥♥♥♥♥assassin, and the switch between modernity and history actually makes more sense in this game than it does in the others. Though you need to be a paitent player to enjoy this game, I think it was worth every hour I put into it.			"

Not only Ezio's story, but also Mr. Miles', since there are some extra actions that can be done outside the Animus.The fights, limited at the beggining of the game, become more challenging near its end, with some ""boss"" fights that are kinda enjoyable.Good game, great saga, highly recommended.

												After trying this one out a couple years ago, I came to it slightly more mature and with an xbox 360 controller. What a treat it was. Although some really didn't like the modern but virtual-assassin setting, I didn't find it too annoying and actually thought it somewhat intriguing. To me, the highlights of this game are its' graphics, combat, and historical atmosphere and setting. The world is bright and the animations extremely fluid. Speaking of fluid, so is the combat as you assassinate one enemy after another executing counters and sweet but brutal combos. If you're a history fan, this game also has a rich historical atmosphere and storyline to follow, although it's basically completely fictional. I picked this game up for $3 and got 20 very enjoyable hours out of it. Not too bad at all. 8.6/10.			"

												A revolution in 3rd person gaming. Truly extraordinary for its' time. Obviously high quality as it led to a series of sequels that has since turned into one of the most successful franchises in gaming history. That aside there are several components of AC1 that have not aged well. The missions are woefully repetative. Go to a new city, find all the viewpoints, ""gather information"" by doing the exacty same side quests over and over again, etc etc. After the first 4 hours the latter 16 hours are pretty much the same thing on repeat until you get to the end. And to describe the ending, all that can be said is ""Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!"". Then you wake up as Desmond feeling really satisfied and the game ends in the middle of more stuff happening that you don't get to explore. Overall 8/10 for its time. Today? 6.5 out of 10. TL:DR Just start the series off with AC 2			"

												One of the classics from the early 360/PS3 era. You play as Desmond, a test subject for a mysterious project which involves the use of a machine called ""The Animus"". The Animus transports the subject into the body of any ancestor from the subject's bloodline, via genetic memory. Altair is the ancestor of choice in this game. There's so much running and jumping it'll make you want to take up parkour. The animation is beautiful as well as the worlds. The worlds are so impressive, visiting places like Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre, each having it's own distinct feel and design. Certainly a work of art. Buy it, play it, love it.			"

												So here's what is odd.  If this review was written after my first play through when I played the game back on a PS3 some many years ago, I would only half-halfheartedly recommend this game.  However, after a full play through and many years to consider what had been bothering me before about the game, I finally had the proper mindset for this game.You see, in this game, a game about stealthy killing (or in my case, not so stealthy killing) all the mechanics feed into that activity.  For example, it annoyed me in the original play through that I couldn't just pickpocket money to give to beggars to make them go away, or to buy knives from merchants.  Now I realize in my second play through that these things are mechanics meant to make being sneaky that much harder; the drunks, mentally impaired, beggars, etc are all there to make it harder for you to kill and silently blend into the crowd.  It bothered me that the game seemed more interested in making me run than stand and fight; with this newest play through, I see that they are trying to teach that discretion is the better part of valor, sometimes.  In other words, running from a fight is not a bad thing.  Not that that kept me from killing over 20 guards in a row, but it takes a bit of finesse, and full command of all your abilities.  This isn't God of War or Darksiders or some spectacle fighter, you aren't meant to hurtle towards foes (though near the endgame you certainly can).The game feeds that need for moving fast, for speed and alacrity that is fed in other games by battle, but here it's fed by efficiency.  Be it moving over rooftops, through streets, killing guards, hiding, climbing, assassinating, escorting, whatever you do, the game expects you to be as efficient as possible, to make choices and change those choices as the situation demands.In other words, even 6 years after its release, this game still is very good at forcing you to know all your tools.  You can't just know one attack, one move, and expect the game to work fine.  You could still get through, but the game would be much less fun.  No, this game demands that you know it well to play it well.  In that, it demands knowledge, and the intelligence of when to use your knowledge.  Much in the same way Altair must learn, you to must learn.  And to me, that is a possible mark of a good game.  Highly recommended, especially with those for the patience to learn.			"

												A revolution in 3rd person gaming. Truly extraordinary for its' time. Obviously high quality as it led to a series of sequels that has since turned into one of the most successful franchises in gaming history. That aside there are several components of AC1 that have not aged well. The missions are woefully repetative. Go to a new city, find all the viewpoints, ""gather information"" by doing the exacty same side quests over and over again, etc etc. After the first 4 hours the latter 16 hours are pretty much the same thing on repeat until you get to the end. And to describe the ending, all that can be said is ""Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!"". Then you wake up as Desmond feeling really satisfied and the game ends in the middle of more stuff happening that you don't get to explore. Overall 8/10 for its time. Today? 6.5 out of 10. TL:DR Just start the series off with AC 2			"

												Amazing, considering the date it was released. However, it would have been better if the storyline was more creative, or actions were more exciting and not repeating over and over. As you are playing, you will find yourself trying to finish the mission as soon as possible because you are getting tired of it.Instructions of controls do not make sense, - you will get used to it soon though- you can not put subtitles on or skip cinematics.However, generally, it is a good game. I recommend to play this game before playing Assassins' Creed 2 to enrich understanding of the storyline.			"

												I have waited a very long time to get Assassin's Creed. When I saw it was on sale, of course I couldn't pass up the chance to buy it. I had never played an Assassin's Creed game before (I only watched videos) and it was worth the cost. Great graphics, interesting storyline; it has everything I love in a game. The one problem I see is the difficult time I have with the controls. They are slightly confusing and it is very hard to turn your character when sprinting. When I am climbing up a wall to get away from soldiers and they manage to make me fall down, I try to run away, only to constantly try running up the wall again since it takes so long for the game to understand that I want to turn away. I am usually almost dead by then so a ragequit follows. With the only complaint I have about the game, Assassin's Creed is a fun and interesting play. I definitely recommend it for those who are unsure.			"

												When it comes to Assassins Creed I always think, THIS was the game that I remember I was excited to see. Being able to free roam in a form of feeling like you could use everything in your enviroment was a HUGE step in games when this was released. The story is semi-great but after awhile the gameplay can become a bore. Going through and killing targets 1 after one, each location is the same. The enviroment itself and first time players will feel the excitement after the first few battles, then it slowly will become to a halt after it becomes a long story line of reputation. All in all, this is the staple for the series and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know where the series started from.			"

												[I ACTUALLY QUITE LIKE ASSASSINS CREED, I'M JUST NITPICKING TO MAKE IT MORE ENTERTAINING, NOBODY LIKES A BALLWASHER]Assassin's Creed... This was not my introduction to this series. I had played ACIII first on a friend's Xbox 360. I then decided that I shall learn of the other Assassin's before. Now, in this day and age 7 years is a long time and as of writing this review it has been like almost 7 years since this game came out. It is technically ""old"" which is dumb because something like SimCity 1 is old not some game from 7 years ago that looks fine now. After playing ACIII I was willing to understand that AC1 came out a good 5 years before and is probably not as good. I then realised that Altair, unlike Connor controls like he has cinderblocks strapped to his thighs and he has♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off gravity sometime in the past. His running speed, while still lightyears faster than mine, was severly slower. He also plummets to the ground like a  semi-realistic cartoon character who has realised that he is off the cliff and now must fall. It's great that there are conveniently placed Hay bales every 3 feet to blanket Altair's drunken falling. They talk about how Altair is one of the best Assassin's at the time, if this is true, no wonder the templars (evil generic bad guys) have been stomping on the Assassin's (Secret organization who pretty much took the Robin Hood thing really almost too far, especially the hood bit.) Altair has to have a conversation with words so large and self interested they practically walked away to buy a new yorker and sip drip coffee every time he kills a target and this is quite a few times, like 9 in the game. 9 times you have to listen to the generic douchewaffle say the same thing as the last generic douchewaffle but in a slightly more snotty and arrogant way. These cutscenes get to be like 9 or 10 minutes long and they're UNSKIPPABLE! I should probably go over the plot before I rip into the game anymore. Well, you're Altair an assassin who works for the assassins. He is given 9 people to kill in order to get back some artifact or something. That's it. For a story driven game the story is pretty lackluster. At the end there is plot twist, that I'm not gonna spoil, but if you didn't see it coming from several million lightyears away, I suggest you stop eating paste and finish 1st grade.The 9 assassinations I mention before, cannot be completed right away, because then the game would be like 45 minutes long. You have to take part in the same 4 minigames before you can assassinate your target. Now, the assassination is obviously the fun part. It's in the name. Most of the game however is tailing some poorly voice acted (I'll get to that later)♥♥♥♥♥♥or pickpocketing from some poorly voice acted♥♥♥♥♥♥which sounds fun... but is just walking up to them pressing shift and running away like some socially inept girl scout on her first day of selling cookies. You are rewarded with some information that is for some reason necessary but you never actually use. These minigames should either be toned down or be gone. The absolutely worst one is the eavesdropping one. All you do is sit on a bench kind of close by and DO NOTHING. I went and  got my hot pocket out of the microwave when these bits happened. I'm sure the game wouldn't have sold as well if it was called BENCHWARMERS CREED.It also felt somewhat anticlimactic during a few of the assassinations. They either involved walking up beside someone in a slightly more colorful robe and stabbing them or walking up in front of them and stabbing them with a throat while the broken AI decided whether they should stop you from stabbing them or continue walking into a wall. The actual combat that wasn't assassinations was generally just block block stab. It was a more depressing and violent version of simon says.Now, I've saved most of the good for the last. The setting is awesome spanning 3 fair sized cities Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre. Jerusalem is more Jewishy, Damascus is mor Islamy and Acre is more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. My problem with the cities though is not the size, which every reviewer seems to think is a problem. Every open world game doesn't need to span ♥♥♥♥ing Bavaria. My problem is samy-ness. One block in Acre looks like every other block in Acre, etc. They look cool, but its the same cool. There are a few historical landmarks, but the only city I was even remotely familiar with was Jerusalem and I only recognized Dome of the Rock. It was cool to climb it though!So, lets see. Semi ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ freerunning controls that are still pretty good in comparison to most game controls, nice areas if not semi-samey, a main character who was acted by the Intern at Ubisoft and a boring storyline. Even after all this I still liked it.			"

												The first in the great series of Blockbuster Assassin's Creed games. This first game isn't really great when it comes to Gameplay. You need to assasinate 9 people, but before you can do those missions, you need to interrogate, steal items or rescue someone that has information about your target. What it boils down to, is that you do the same thing 9 times. Combine this with a lacking combat system and you would say this is a piece of sh*t. But, what makes this game great are two things; Atmosphere and Story. Especially the dual story; you constantly want to know what's happening on the other side of the Animus, no matter which story you're in. It's powerful, mysterious and I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to start playing Assassin's Creed games. It's one of the least enjoyable Assassin's Creed games, but it is still interesting and a great starting point for the blockbuster franchise.			"

												This is the first time I play this game. I've never been into to the whole Assassin's Creed hype. While the missions are silly and repetitive, even after 5 years, the game looks beautiful and the game mechanics are solid, the controls are tight. Combat's engaging and never gets old.A fine game, one that made me a fan of the franchise.  5 years after its release... "

												Great game. I really like the story, the graphics, the engine, everything is top notch. I would suppose the only problem would be that some of the game functions tend to get repetetive or extremely unrealistic. Like seriously, a hay stack under every tower?!I personally thought that the combat is really great, but there are no air assassinations...A great feature of this game is that it has so many collectibles and whatnot. A downside is that unlike the rest of its series, it does not have Uplay, so I cannot save my savefile into a cloud.			"

												A must play for AC fans ! Definatly a great beginning of the AC story ... the game mechanics are bit buggy and the sidequests are totally boring but the main story is just AWESOME... and the graphics still do a great job .... !I started with AC2 and played then Brotherhood but decided to start AC1 before i go over to Revelations... so far i can only say this was a good decision:DOnly problems are you have to reconfigure the Gamepad Layout to match the AC2 _> Layouts and ... well Altair is bit stupid when it comes to jump over water :P so dont go mad :DD "

												I played this game back in 2008, so before the second game had been released. It was pretty damn great then, but now its age really shows. The only thing that's like I remember is the combat, which is somewhat difficult at times. Air assassinations are possible but annoying (want to kill a civillian? here's your chance), stealth is almost nonexistent, and climbing things turns out to be a chore, as Altair takes forever to make his way up buildings.Side quest? What are those? Each time you go to one of the 3 major cities, you have to investigate your target. This comes down to repetitive side quests involving pick pocketing, beating people up for information, eavesdropping, and some other silly missions like collecting flags or killing archers. There's no variety, and you can't cut to the chase (most of them have annoying cutscenes). By the time I was on the last few assassinations, I was doing as little as possible to get through the game. There was no reason to complete everything aside from lengthening your time with the game.The plot and the characters inside the Animus are also very forgettable. Who are these people I'm killing? Why am I killing them? Oh, they're templars. Well that makes sense. But who ARE they? I don't remember any of the names of the 9 people I was tasked to kill aside from the ""big bad"", Robert de Sable. The game doesn't make it a point to try and make the characters memorable. Altair is a bland protagonist. His arrogance is frustrating and his decisions make no sense sometimes, or at least he rarely justifies them. His ""growth"" is only shown in one scene where he reiterates what he was told at the beginning of the game about the Creed. His voice acting also sucks, but that's besides the point.I still recommend this game because it's where the series started, and outside the animus scenes are still interesting. Learning about the fight between the assassins and the templars in the present day, meeting Desmond, etc, are all still worth the time you have to put into the game itself. Will you want to play it again anytime soon? Probably not. In a few years I'll just use wiki pages to refresh my memory on what's important. Now on to the superior sequel.			"

Graphics is amazing for 2008 game and mechanics of climbing and killing is well made, I cannot complain about it at all. You may get some repetetive feeling sometimes, but you can just search for flags and roam around cities if you do not want to play the main quest right away.			"

												I must say very impressive. This game was a lot of fun. I judged it too quickly , I had it for a while, and decided after watching a playthrough of a few levels on youtube I decided maybe I was too hasty. I redownloaded the game and really had a great time. The game can be used with a keyboard... but you will either A. Kill your keyboard or B. Kill your hand. Whichever comes first. I was never good with gamepads but after my hand began to hurt with frustation, I pulled out my pad and really REALLY benefited from it. The Game makes it easy too, since the circles in the upper right mirror the layout of your controller, and change accordingly it allowed me to easily adapt and in doing so become a much better assassin haha. Anyhow highly recommend this game.			"

												In the first Assassin's Creed game you're the boring dude (Desmond) who's been kidnapped and is forced to lie the hell down and run around in a virtual reality as his assassin ancestor Altair, because the modern day moe'suckra Templars want information from your tiny baby brain memory.This game is as good as the second game but in it's own way. I feel a bit more like an assassin in this one (though he still looks a bit out of place), the combat is more of a challenge and assassinating people is generally harder. There isn't as much side stuff to do just the flag collecting thing, and those other 3 optional missions you can do when you're finding information for each assassination memory.You can't change your clothes and armour and you are given weapons when the game says so. You also have alot less weapons than Ezio and you don't get as much help. Overall it's just more challenging but it feels like a bigger achievement when you kill them dudes good.			"

												The original Assassin's Creed has set new boundaries for the adventure genre. The parkour and the overall gameplay are simply impressive for a 2008 game.I've only played this game in 2014 because I wanted to get into the AC series and figured AC1 was the first step I should take. Although it is EXTREMELY repetitive, it's a game I'm willing to finish 100% if I ever have the time. If not, I'll just complete the Story.It's worth adding that, although I have not reached the game's ending, I've already found a plethora of collectibles. Be it small flags or side missions, this game has a lot of that kind of extras.All in all, AC1, despite lacking in variety, has re-defined the adventure/action genre in a way that is yet to be seen in any other game outside of the AC series. Or so I think.			"

												Its a great game and most of the reviews will attest this. So I'll just skip to the cons:1. Controls - Have you ever played Prince of Persia Warrior Within? well this game is worse than that. And considering you have two ""stances"" available, high profile moves and low profile moves, neither of which is very intuitive or responsive, it's twice as bad.The protagonist will randomly climb walls, jump into water or not grag a ledge. During fight scenes he may completely ignore a defensive stance at the beginning. And some of the combat mechanices like counter (by far the most important one) are flaky at best.And the PC controller neeeds to be selected in the options menu everytime for it to work.2. NPC - There are some deliberately annoying NPCs like beggars, drunks and lunatics that will try their best to get in your way and slow you down. I have no idea why this was included in the gameplay and why so frequently.3. Menu - Its got a menu screen at startup, and a menu screen within the game. Mildly annoying.However a definite must to get onto the AC bandwagon.			"

												The Crusade's, parkour, stealth, and assassinations all sound great and Assassin's Creed promised all of those things and that sounded great but after playing the game it fell a little short.You play Desmond Miles, a man from 2012 AD, who is kidnapped and forced to entered a machine called the Animus that searches a persons DNA and extract memories from the users ancestors. Well one of Desmond's ancestors turns out to be a member of the Assassins Order during the Third Crusade named Altaïr.Altaïr is tasked to help stop the Crusade by killing 9 leaders on both sides of the war. As he continues to kill the men, Altaïr finds out why he was sent to kill them and also why Desmond was kidnapped.In order to assassinate the leaders, Altaïr must gather information by pickpocketing, beating a confession, eavesdropping, or helping a Order informer on the target that is in a sector and then get approval from the Order leader in the city with the information.Also he can do a couple side missions by saving citizens that go can help getting into a place with scholars or having vigilantes that while hold on to guards as Altaïr gets away.All of this is the real problem with the game as getting the information is all the same in every level of the game and gets really boring fast.Visually the game looks great even on a standard def TV and I bet looks better on a HDTV.Controls are tight most of the time and only feel loose when fighting but not so loose to be killed too many times.But another fault is that story is weak as its pretty confusing and a bit convoluted.Overall the game is a good game and worth borrowing to play but its seems like the game needed a little more work in some areas that could have make it a great game.7/10(This review is based on the PS3 version when is was originally released so does not reflect on the PC port)			"

												The first Assassin’s Creed was a good game for its time but it definitely has not aged well. The good things about it is that it's a great addition for a die hard AC fan. You get to play as Altier and know his backstory before the other ancestors in the franchise.When this game was released, the environment was quite rich in innovative and the NPCs acted and reacted to your character realistically. For it’s time, it was quite an achievement. However, the later games definitely are better than this one. I will list the cons.- Repetitive- Always have to select the Xbox controller setting every time you start the game.- Crashing- You have to use a mod to have your Xbox controller configured correctly.- There is no in game reward for collecting flags and killing templars except for bragging rights.I would definitely recommend playing this game after playing the later AC games just to see the back story and how the whole franchise started. The storyline is actually very good with twists and turns. However, if you aren't a big AC fan then you can go ahead and skip this one.			"

												I'm not just recommending Assassin's Creed. I'm recommending the entire series. I would be doing this on Assassin's Creed 2, since it is the BEST of all of them, but I don't own it on Steam so... Anyway, let's get to the points.Assassin's Creed: A historical/science- fiction game where you play as Altair, a legendary assassin from Isreal, working for Almualim to kill templars and obtain the Apple of Eden. Made in 2008, the graphics are great for its time and, with a rich storyline and cliffhanger ending, makes you want to play more.Assassin's Creed 2: This time, you play as Ezio, a nobleman from Italy in the 15th century. Ezio's father and two brothers were wrongfully framed for something they didn't do. Enraged, Ezio escapes the city with his sister and mother and seeks revenge against the people who killed his relatives. Made in 2010, this game has amazing graphics and, again, makes you want to play more. I haven't finished any of the AC2 games, but you should still get them.			"

												First installment of a great, great, awesome series. I personally prefer the Ezio (II, brotherhood, revalations) storyline. This game will get you started with an awesome series. It has great playability as a start out game, but less so after you did the newer ones, since you lose alot of functionality when you don't play yhe games in order.For an older game its pretty cool, If you don't care to much about 100% (collect a load of flags, bit boring) you'll easily get 15-20 hours out of it. Afterwards just move on to AC2 :)			"

(which make it very interesting) +Parkour style gameplay (+stealth) allows you to approach your target as you want.  +The architecture of the cities represented perfectly +Voice acting is quite good___Cons-Altair can't swim -You get a little bored during the investigations you do before the main mission can be access -Lack of armor or weapons upgrades -Repettetive speeches and no subtitles Assassin's Creed is definitely worth every penny. Particularly if bought on sale.			"

												I finished this game on the xbox. Yes the missions were the same, but i really enjoyed my time playing the game. For me personally, i have a hard time playing this game on the PC. I wonder how the ""master race"" as you call yourself, are doing this. With a controller it is so much easier.I would recommend playing this on a console.			"

												The biggest problem here is that it gets repetitive. Repetitive quests, traversal, combat. Thankfully combat changes with new abilities, with experience of the player, with difficulty of enemies. Moving through the world doesn't, and has some problems, but otherwise is a lot of fun. That leaves the story progress which sadly isn't very interesting. The story is cool, the method to get to it is not. And I can not imagine collecting all those flags. Pure insanity :D. So this one is a bit ""grindy"". Not exactly how I like action adventure games.As for the look of the game, it's all very pretty :).And why does quitting the game need to take so many screens and button presses? :PAnyway, the first Assassin's Creed is a fine game. Certainly makes me want to continue the saga. It's my first AC so can't compare to the others. Good enough start this is.			"

												For it's time the game was really good. Playing it now it feels a little dated. If you want to get into the franchise I would say to read up on the first game and skip playing it just to start with the second one since it fixes a lot of the problems me and other people had with this one. Also the lack of subtitles makes it kind of hard to make out some things people are saying (expecially when trying to hear though the vents.) All and all it is a good game I would just say if you don't like it to skip it and move on.			"

												I actually love most of this game. The jumping mechanic and help arent really there, so you need to be slow and careful if you dont want to mess up and die lots from falling to your death. Controls are good overall, and I enjoy the story. For me, the facial expressions during cutscenes could have used a little more love, just due to the fact its one facial expression and lips moving with it. But, considering the small role it plays (theres more gameplay then story), so its not too bad. I would suggest this game to anyone who just enjoys having fun and assassinating people. The game is based on true events, which is cool if you like games with some history in them. Would reccomend			"

												I originally played this game in 2007 when my dad bought it for me and my sister on a whim for our Xbox 360. I remember being infinitely furious at this game at many points, and certainly having to take a good amount of breaks for how difficult certain parts of the game can get. However, I immediately bought this 8 years later upon seeing it on the Steam market, and here's why:-The furiousness built up in this game made it such a huge relief to actually complete *that* mission or find *that* flag/templar. -Even though the whole game is summed up at the start of AC2, this game really teaches you a lot about Desmond, the Templars, and adds a depth to the whole series that you really can't get by skipping this game.-Altair is a f***ing badass.-The missions are repetitive (which you already know if you've read ANY review of this game) but the storyline makes all the extra time doing the same mission ten times in different cities worth it.-There is a lot of bonus stuff and lore you can find in the modern day portions, which I think made the game much more enjoyable. I HATED not being able to leave the Animus in AC2 except for the specified sequences for, respectable, halfway through and the end.All in all, I give this game a solid 8/10. I would (and probably will) definitely play through this game at least two more times. "

												Wow, I've never picked a game in this series up until now.  In a way, it's amazing this series took off.  It's a great idea, a wonderful gameplay conceit that allows it to be ""gamey"" via an in-game explanation (the Animus).  The story is good, like a Dan Brown novel.  The gameplay is tight and refined, considering it's the first entry in the long-running series, and the graphics are decent considering the age.  All that said, it's amazing it all ever went anywhere as horribly repetive and rote the game becomes about halfway through!  Unless you purposefully break the monotony by doing optional tasks, it's basically a rinse-n-repeat of go to this town, do 2 or 3 information gathering tasks, kill a guy.  It wouldn't be so bad if it were an 8-hour game, but it's probably more like 15.  I couldn't keep doing it.  I skipped to AC2.  Recommended only if you must see how the series started, but otherwise, skip it, the sequels are much better, and watch a Youtube video of the story segments in this game to fill in the gaps.			"

												Assassin's creed is a great starter for the AC series, set during The Third Crusade you play as Altaïr Ibn La'Ahad (translates to: The Bird, Son of Noone) a master assassin of the brotherhood who breaks all three tenants of the assassins' creed and is dishonored. Loosing all your weapons and ranks you assassinate targets to have Ubisoft spoon feed you counter attacks and new weapons. Great storyline, the cutscenes could use some work as the player can walk around during the cutscenes which kind of breaks some of them. The parkour is great with one exception, sometimes when leaping off of buildings or cliffs the player hits an invisible wall and slides down it to the ground, the parkour is also notably slower than in other Assassin's Creed games. The controls are built for the console meaining that it does have speep learning curve, example: holding down right click to toggle high profile shift to drop and right click plus w plus space to freerun. the game features great graphics (given that it is from 2008) although some of the textures glitch every once and a while.Overall I would give this game a 8/10			"

												I don't know how to put it into the right words, but i'm utterly disappointed.I'd normaly not write a evaluation of a game i played only for such a short time, but i have never encountered such a strong difference between general opinion and my experiences.After playing it for a couple of hours, i had to put it aside because i was so annoyed by this game.Controls are 100% console, which means with mouse+keyboard you are in danger to create a knot of your fingers, lol.This games system of control may work superb on a console but it's almost unplayable on PC imo.For example, changes between stealth and not stealth mode are barely noticeable (UI) which can result in a chaotic brawl with several guards. I could get used to this without problem but the constant changes between present and medieval times completely kill the immersion for me and the futuristic UI doesn't help getting immersed into the medieval ages. Nor do the continuing jumps in the storyline help creating a feel for the game world. I have no idea if it changes later in the game, but i don't have the desire to find that out. "

												Why are people reviewing this in 2015? Most of the negative reviews are from people playing it years later. The video game industry has evolved and improved a lot since 2008 and no matter what anyone says this game was revolutionary.I guess if you didn't play it back in 2008 and are only picking it up now, then it doesn't really have as much gameplay as Black Flag for example, but that doesn't make it a lesser game. Very few people can pick up Super Mario 64 or Unreal Tournament today having never played it before, and find it amazing. That's just how it is. The gameplay for the later Assassin's Creed games only got better because this was the foundation and they built from there. This is my favourite Assassin's Creed game and it shouldn't be overlooked.			"

This title achieved a impressive recognition and is responsible for one of the most successful franchise of all time.  As all of AC games, the graphics are awesome, atmosphere is great and the historic context are very interesting. The problem with this game is that after play a number of missions you realize that the missions are kind of repetitive and then the game will be losing it´s appeal.  But anyway it´s a great game, it was a blow when released and have a important role in the games history.  "

												This game was released on November 13, 2007. I am fairly new to the Assassin's Creed series and just recently began playing the second game on PS3. I highly recommend this game to anyone who plays any of the Assassin's Creed games. I wanted to play this one first because the storyline does connect to the other games and I didn't want to miss out. This game includes basic gameplay. No achievements, upgrades, money system, etc. Basic weapons and missions. The maps are very diverse and if you like challenges, you will enjoy flag hunting. There are a lot of flags to find throughout the game and several missions to complete. The PC version of Assassin's Creed is the only one to have the Director's Cut Edition which includes 4 bonus missions. The following mission types are as follows: Archer Assassination, Rooftop Race Challenge, Merchant Stand Destruction Challenge, and Escort Challenge. You will be able to play these in each kingdom you travel through. Though these bonus missions are very basic compared to the latest Assassin's Creed games, they were unavailable on the console versions for the first game.Also, Jesper Kyd composed the music for the game. He is known for several video game scores including the Hitman series, a few Assassin's Creed games, and Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, to name a few. I give the game 5 out of 5 stars. It was excellent and the storyline is awesome.			"

												Love/Hate this game. I've played through this game to roughly the 50-75% mark because it's a beautiful engaging game. At the time of release, the game was very original, set in an era that more games should explore. The controls work really well,and it looks great, but there are points in the game where I sit watching nothing, and listening to dialog that doesn't at all help me, or add to my enjoyment of the game. There are times where the game feels action packed and other times where tasks feel tedious. That's what usually causes me to lose interest. Leaving me with a game that I like, but can't bare to finish.			"

												Late review:7/10Besides the repetitive story and missions, the first Assassin's Creed is true to its story, you're playing as an Assassin after all during the year 1191? I forgot.. Theres no happy moments no friends to hang out with, Altair was a born and breed Assassin soon to be Master, your mission is to kill 12 targets your master has given you to redeem yourself.Its simple:- Gather intel- Plan- Assassinate your target- Get in.. Get outAssassins Creed 1 is True to its objective, theres a brotherhood and a Master something the rest of the sequels fail to understand. It's not an adventure game where the main protagainst goes on adventures its about the life of an Assassin.The real reason why Assassin's Creed game story fails everytime is because of the ""Animus"", the game is nothing without the animus of course, but you don't get to see how the character lives you're constantly skipping through time, You don't know what your favourite Assasins food is? what his favoruite colour is? what his favourite weapon to use throwing knives? Sword? their opinion of the hidden blade.Ubisoft releases a book of their game with more in-depth story and details, why can't they make the story of the book into their games...			"

												Visually, Assassin's Creed was way ahead of its time.However, despite its great potential and the revolutionary combat system, the game suffers from VERY repetitive gameplay and missions, which are basically the same all the way through, only in different locations. The story is thrilling and delivers an acceptable beginning to the franchise.Worth a Playthrough! 08/10			"

												Bought the game for $5 when it was on sale with the intentions of getting into the AC series but I found the game kind of boring and repetitive, seems like it's 50% gameplay and 50% dialogue that is not skippable. The gameplay mechanics were pretty good and interesting though, just wish there was more action and less repetitiveness. The game reminds me of the film Wanted (2008), even the plot is pretty similar. Overall good game that could have been better, I might get into the series, I'll give AC2 a chance and see if I'm better satisfied compared to AC1.			"

												I've been meaning to finish this game for a while now. I played Assasin's Creed II first and absolutely loved it. I still haven't completed this one, but I'll get to it some day. From what I can remember, I enjoyed it. Sorry for not being able to give more details.I will say one thing though: the minimap is rubbish. It doesn't show the outline of any buildings so you can't use it for navigation at all, unlike the second game's minimap. From what I can recall, the minimap is basically a circle with cardinal directions wirrten on it with a opqaue background inside that contains a load of markers for quests and whatnot that the minimap if of no use in getting to.

												Humble beginnings for a series which will become one of the most popular in the PS3/360 generation. The graphics on this game is probably the best in the series, the missions are challenging and the way you synch with your ancestor is interesting as well.On the down side, the combat system isn't very good, and along with the depressing free-running and the ability to NOT swim, it's tipped on both scales to say weather or not this is a good game.

												Good game.  I give it a 8/10.  Remarkable for the visuals for a game from 2007.  Looses points for being repetitve and having a camera that you want to kill during combat.  Some points come back for having an intriguing back story.  I didn't realize this is a trilogy with a long story.  I figured it was just run and gun.  Intrigued for AC2.  I stalled out on this game in chapter 2 of 7, mostly due to the repetion, but got going again after seeing an AC4 trailer.  Took about 24 hours total to get through the game.  This is a pretty good stealth game, which is in my wheel house.  The combat is fun, but a bit non-intuitive and timing dependant.  After you get the hang of it though you pretty much can't loose.

This title achieved a impressive recognition and is responsible for one of the most successful franchise of all time.  As all of AC games, the graphics are awesome, atmosphere is great and the historic context are very interesting.

												Ever wondered what the memories of your ancestors were? Well, go find your own Animus, because in this game you control Desmond as he tries to find knowledge that can save the world through the memories of Altair. I would definitely recommend it to people who are HUGE fans of stealth, history and Assassins. However the game is very repetitive, and it has very boring sections where you see interactions with characters you simply do not care about. And that is why, on top of the very automated freerunning, I cannot recommend this game to anyone but the previously mentioned people. Try at your own risk.			"

The gameplay is a little wacky because this was the first entry in the series, a bit of an experiment originally supposed to be a Prince of Persia game, you can probably tell by its roots.Overall the game is good.The port is also kinda meh itself, but once you get used to it its sure to be a good experience.

This has definitely the hardest combat, and it's just SO GOOD. When the game was published, it was one-of-a-kind and it kind of still is. Assassin's Creed II changed so much, that it feels like a totally different game. (Don't get me wrong, loved AC2 also)It's sad, how many people, who play the games of this series have skipped the first part, though. They missed a lot.			"

												In Assassin's Creed you play as Desmond Miles, who get's kidnapped by Abstergo and shoved into what is called an Animus. This machine allows the user to revisit there ancestors past and view it how it actually happened. The reason Abstergo kidnapped Desmond in particular is because his ancestor Altair knows where 'The Pieces of Eden' are. The Pieces of Eden are powerful objects that were created by 'The one's that came before' and Abstergo wants them to rule the world.Pros:- Interesting Story- Fun GameplayCons:- Repetitive Nature- Lack of Character Progression- Open World that's not so open			"

												NOTE: Only worth it if it is on sale, game play is repetitive but fun for awhile.The graphics are okay and the plot is decent, but where this game really shines is the world size and freedom. You run around huge cities however you like, climbing up walls jumping from roof to roof and assassinating key targets... or anyone you please really. You'll die quite a bit until you figure out your specific fighting style but after that you can hack and slash all you please without any major issues. The one drawback is this game is repetitive as hell, the quests are always the same and the story line just isn't strong enough for me to bother with it. I play to kill some people and run around the tops of buildings pretending like I'm some bad♥♥♥♥♥form of Aladdin for a few minutes but that is about it. Overall worth it if you can get it on sale, otherwise don't bother.			"

												I actually love most of this game. The jumping mechanic and help arent really there, so you need to be slow and careful if you dont want to mess up and die lots from falling to your death. Controls are good overall, and I enjoy the story. For me, the facial expressions during cutscenes could have used a little more love, just due to the fact its one facial expression and lips moving with it. But, considering the small role it plays (theres more gameplay then story), so its not too bad. I would suggest this game to anyone who just enjoys having fun and assassinating people. The game is based on true events, which is cool if you like games with some history in them. Would reccomend			"

												7/10 - There was the basis of a really good stealth franchise here, one that looked great and had a pretty intellectual message. Shame it never got to be a full fleshed-out game, and instead leaned hard on its flashy but shallow combat, and its cool but janky freerunning. Later sequels would make the story dumber, the freerunning faster and less believable, and the combat shamefully easier, but have more content and - most notably - no god damned crazy people shoving you back and forth like a tennis ball.Needed more substance, and a lot more dialogue for radiant NPC's, but as a core experience, the original 'Assassin's Creed' feels a lot bolder and more imaginative than later games in the series. I see the game now as something like a parable, the repetition of key mechanics and events serving to showcase the hero's journey and growth, and how he perceives his macabre work. Then there's some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about Stonemasilluminatemplars and a supernatural bossfight ending, at which point I switch off entirely. But at least this game had my bloody sword in a scabbard that was attached to my body in some way. Seriously, don't get how this is so hard to do, but it makes a big aesthetic impact, seeing my weapon just hovering there. It cannot be so very time consuming to give every weapon a sheathe. Please Ubisoft, cut the sci fi nonsense in your narrative, and bring back scabbards! Then I'll start buying your things again.Provided they actually work.			"

												Ahhh, assassin's creed! No numbers after that, no other names like Syndicate or Unity! Just it: Assassin's creed. The good old times right?Assassin's creed is not a masterpiece, but is pretty fun and enjoyable.Starting with the flaws:- The gameplay is repetitive; ""Come to a city, hear a conversation, interrogate someone... repeat""; This is his major flaw. If you don't have the patience: DON'T play this game. It can be really frustrating. I was starting to be sick of the same missions on the middle of the game. However, if you have patience, it can be pretty fun. (if not, start in ac2)- Repetitive dialogues and characters (people on the street). I swear that i killed the same guy at least 5 times.- Exiting the game requires movement through 3 or more menu screens;- Limited incentive to explore and collect;- No replay value;Don't let his flaws distract you from the good game that he can be:+ Environments are large, detailed and absolutely gorgeous;+ The environments are credible in their attempt to recreate an historical period.+ Voice-acting is excellent; general sound-design too and is strikingly original;+ Good UI;+ Quick-travel available;+ Good ad enjoyable history;+ Combat is good and cinematic;+ Killing a target involves a series of different missions; They are unvaried but adds for immersion.In general, Assassin's creed is a decent game. It's not as good as the sequel, but you should play it.7.5/10			"

												Relatively easy to beat. Combat is decent. They were really confident in making a sequeal/many sequeals, because there is no ""definite"" ending to this game.Pros: Free-running, amazing kills and an interesting storyline. Cons: Funny AI, some bugs and ""eagle eye"" is the worse vision feature I have ever seen. Historical inaccuracies.The idea of assassinating people is to kill a few, to saves the lives of many. Ironically, there are many cases in which you kill like a GAZILLION soldiers to save ONE poor civilian. I have probably killed about a few hundred guards in a city of a few thousands [Jerusalem] but I guess it's still less than 0.1% so thats' okay. Makes you wonder who is right after all. Still, ""Nothing is true, everything is permitted"", so even the creed can be cast away once awhile.Overall, It's a good game. Would recomend.			"

												I had played this game a few years back, but now decided to give it another shot. It can certainly still compete with today's games, especially from a graphics standpoint, which is, in itself, quite remarkable.If you have never played this game, I would call it a merger between Splinter Cell, Batman and Hitman. You have to blend into your environment and hide at times, you have to navigate rooftops, you can be a vigilante, and you have your mission to complete and have a certain freedom on how to do so. While this game is certainly not as refined as its successors in the series, it was, much like the first Splinter Cell, the first Batman (Arkham series), and the first Hitman, a diamond in the rough, with exceptional gameplay, graphics and design. At least for their respective times. While the subsequent titles had a lot of refinement and improvement, this first Assassin's Creed still stands its ground in the sands of time. Add to that the soundtrack, and you have great entertainment.The only downside - to me - is the obvious console breeding ground, and the somewhat shady save point situation, but I guess that's the way it is. I'm getting used to the whole checkpoint idea these days, albeit with a heavy heart. I do miss my quick save option.Either way, give this game a try, especially if you can snap it up in a deal! You won't regret it if you like the other games mentioned above. Also, it's not as repetitive as people say; while the handling is, true, the way you approach diverse challenges isn't.			"

												Game is not for everyone, and if you want to get in AC franchise, I advice you to start with AC 2. This game isn't the best in series, but definitely must play for AC fans and those who liked old AC's better. Game locations are worth to explore, i really liked music and main story is interesting. Mechanics feel clunky at times and NPC's aren't the smartest, and there are moments when game just makes you angry.However overall game experience is OK, and if you are willing to do with some repetitive missions and and sometimes jerky mechanics, than you should give it a try!

												Pros:Interesting Story.Mechanics learnt gradually.Re-playable missions.Good mixture of stealth and combat.Good combat mechanics.Cons:Repetitive missions.Un-skippable long cut-scenes.Music is short and only plays at certain times, leaving long periods with only abidance sounds.Story:Assassin's Creed has two main stories: That of the present with bartender Desmond Miles who has been captured by a large pharmaceutical company called Abstergo and forced to re-live the genetic memories of his ancestor Altair, and that of Altair himself, who is an Assassin in 1192, during the Third Crusade, sent on a mission to kill nine men who bring war apon the land.Desmond is told that Abstergo seeks information from him, and that a machine which can make him relive the memories of Altair will help uncover than information. While in the past, Altair makes a series of deadly mistakes which harms the Assassin Brotherhood. He is demoted by his master and sent on a mission to kill nine men. Some of them Crusaders, some of the Saracens. But all are working together for an odd purpose under the leadership of the French Crusader, Robert de Sabre. With each kill, a rank, equipment and abilities are returned to Altair and he will learn more about why these nine men work together.Assassin's Creed largely takes place in the Holy Land of 1192 in five locations: The mountain fort and village of Masyf which is home of the Assassins, The Saracen-controlled cities of Damascus and Jerusalem, the Crusader-controlled city of Arce, and the Kingdom, which represents the lands in-between all four cites.In Damascus, Jerusalem and Arce, three each of these men wait. Altair must travel to them and preform investigations to uncover his target's location and use the information to decide how to approach and kill each target.Mechanics:In order to find a target, Altair must preform a series of Investigations. These take several forms: Eavesdropping on conversations to learn information, pickpocketing letters which explain more about his target's purpose and helping fellow Assassin's by assassinating other targets amongst others.While playing as Altair, you spend your time in one of two states: Low Profile and High Profile, which are changed by pressing a button. In Low Profile, Altair preforms socially acceptable but slower actions, allowing him to navigate his way without drawing attention, such as following a target or remaining hidden. In High Profile, Altair preforms aggressive and socially unacceptable actions, allowing him to run or enter combat. Knowing the right time to use Low or High Profile is key.The Blend mechanic allows Altair to blend crowds to help me remain hidden. This can be done either alone, or within groups of roaming monks to help him access places guarded. If guards are chasing him, he can attempt to blend within crowds, benches or haystacks to lose their sight of him and return to being hidden.Almost every building or surface is climbable, allowing free running and parkour to get you to locations and out of trouble, from leaping from beam-to-mean, to climbing up a tall spire. If it sticks out, you can grab onto it. This also allows you to see the city surroundings.Once investigations have been completed, Altair can then attempt to assassinate his target, which can often be done in multiple ways. The environment allows for multiple approaches to a target, and mission replayability means a player can play the mission again and try to assassinate a target in a diffrent style.Each time a target is killed, Altair and the target engage in conversation, and each target always defends their actions, believing they are doing good and leaves Altair wondering if they really are deserving of death.Combat mechanics:Altair has access to five weapons: A sword, dagger, hidden blade, throwing knives and his fists. The sword is a slow but powerful weapon, the dagger is faster than the sword, but deals less damage. The hidden blade is a one-hit, one-kill weapon, but only to character who are unaware of Altair. The fists are used for beat-up missions, where Altair attempts to get information from un-cooperative people.Combat is preformed in the both Low and High Profile states, and which state you are in determines the actions taken. For example: Wielding a sword in Low Profile and pressing Action allows Altair to attack, built pressing Action in High Profile allows Altair to counter an attack in-stead.Altair can also grab people to throw them off ledges to their deaths, or just down on the ground so they are out of combat for a few seconds. However, the enemies also have access to the same abilities Altair has. Enemies are split into three categories: Solders, Elites and Commanders: Solders are weak but often come in larger numbers. They take only a few hits to die and die to one counter-attack. Elites deal more damage, have more health, can grab and throw Altair, and take two counter-attacks to die. Commanders have even more damage and health than Elites, can break Altair's defence to leave him exposed to an attack, can counter-attack themselves and die to three counter-attacks. The can easily be identified by their uniform. Diffrent combat stratus are needed to fight depending on who you are facing.Music:Music is good, but sparse. Every time Altair enters a new location, a certain music track will play, but it is short, acting more like an announcing theme than actual music, and won't play again for some time. There is also a track for Altair being chased and Altair in combat, depending on what city he is in. While outside of combat, music is replaced by ambience.Other:There are alot of collectables: Each location has one hundred flags to collect (with the exception of Masyf, which has twenty) as well as sixty Templars to assassinate spread over the Holy Land and View Points to Synchronise. All locations can be revisited after the first time there.Overall, a great game. Well-written story but the cut-scenes are long and un-skippable, so any replays means you have to watch them all the time. Missions can be replayed to assassinate a target how they want and in a diffrent style each time, but investigations often lack variety. Hunting collectables can be fun, but also irritating without a guide after so many have been found.			"

												This game can get a bit repetitive and linear at times, but it still proved to be a lot of fun. I got to kill people, and then upgrade my ability to kill people. The story line was good as it brought about more killing, and the graphics were good, especially the ones where you got to be murder-y. This probably sounds like the rant of a psychopath... But it's still a fun game. I liked Altair more than Ezio, which is probably the minority opinion. For the start of the series this worked pretty gosh darn well, the health mechanics as it related to the storyline was one of the more inspired ideas. Buy it, kill some gaurds and templars, throw some knives and nap in some bureaus.			"

												If you played Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag before trying this game, you are going to be dissatisfied with the controller layout and overall feel of the game. But storyline-wise, PLAY IT.If you are like me and love playing console originals that have been ported to PC with a controller, then I would not suggest sitting too far away from the screen with this game. When it says partial controller support, it means it. The first time you run the game you are gonna be required to use the keyboard and mouse to skip the long intro cutscene (you are gonna want to do this every time you run it actually) and to actually get to the main menu. After that, you gonna need to re-map ALL of the controls. The triggers don't register, so use the bumpers instead. Not to mention, if you are indeed coming from some of the later AC's, the combat and parkour system will feel VERY sluggish/non-responsive. But this is the first game: of course it will be that way.Beyond that, the game is awesome so far. The storyline, I will agree, is VERY repetitive, but pay attention to the meetings with the leader. This is definitely where they introduce the Templars and WHY the Assassins hate them. Not to mention, you start to see the changes in both Altaïr and Desmond with every meeting / Animus break.Okay, time for my little goings-on about the graphics.While not as intensive as Black Flag, the graphics for AC1 are both crisp and pretty detailed given when the game was published.Overall, 9/10 because of repetitiveness. Granted, basically having the job of ""Hitman"" would be pretty repetitive - ""Go here. Kill this guy. Come back unseen.""			"

												NOT A BAD GAME AT ALL, BUT I CANNOT RECOMMEND IT -Graphics in 2008 = 10/10 (we all got hooked because of the graphics)-Graphics NOW = 9/10 (still great, with powerful 2010-2014 computers this game WILL SHINE on max settings)-Story = 3/10 boring, cheesy and confusing, the beginning of the Apples of Eden/Abstergo/Desmond Miles B.S. story, lol-Gameplay = 6/10 decent stealth (though not perfect by a long shot) + block and parry combat; no bugs, though repetitive; you'll also have problems trying to switch arms during combat, since you must first unlock the target (yeah, it sounds confusing because it is)-Save system = 0/10, just the typical autosave checkpoint S-H-I-T that will AUTOERASE itself if you quit the game before finishing a mission (you'll get mad if your pc freezes while on a mission, you'll have to start it since the beginning)-Replay value = 4/10 (the final save file will allow you to randomly replay ANY mission, so no point in playing the whole thing again since the beginning; as I've said, the story is lame)conclusion: the first AC was kind of barebones and unpolished (despite the gorgeous graphics); I'd recommend it only for those interested in the Crusades, since it's AWESOME to roam across the 12th Century Jerusalem-Damascus-Acre and to kick some (original) templar♥♥♥♥♥ but this game offers nothing more; for people interested mainly in the gameplay, I say jump directly to AC II			"

												Love/Hate this game. I've played through this game to roughly the 50-75% mark because it's a beautiful engaging game. At the time of release, the game was very original, set in an era that more games should explore. The controls work really well,and it looks great, but there are points in the game where I sit watching nothing, and listening to dialog that doesn't at all help me, or add to my enjoyment of the game. There are times where the game feels action packed and other times where tasks feel tedious. That's what usually causes me to lose interest.

												In the first Assassin's Creed game you're the boring dude (Desmond) who's been kidnapped and is forced to lie the hell down and run around in a virtual reality as his assassin ancestor Altair, because the modern day moe'suckra Templars want information from your tiny baby brain memory.This game is as good as the second game but in it's own way. I feel a bit more like an assassin in this one (though he still looks a bit out of place), the combat is more of a challenge and assassinating people is generally harder. There isn't as much side stuff to do just the flag collecting thing, and those other 3 optional missions you can do when you're finding information for each assassination memory.You can't change your clothes and armour and you are given weapons when the game says so. You also have alot less weapons than Ezio and you don't get as much help. Overall it's just more challenging but it feels like a bigger achievement when you kill them dudes good.			"

I got it because I was given the latest version (Black Flag) as a bundle for something else I bought and thought I should play through the series as to understand the entirety of the story.Alas, I'll probably never get around to finishing this game or ever playing its successors.I do think a lot of people will get enjoyment out of the game, even if I didn't and as such would recommend it.

												Amazing, considering the date it was released. However, it would have been better if the storyline was more creative, or actions were more exciting and not repeating over and over. As you are playing, you will find yourself trying to finish the mission as soon as possible because you are getting tired of it.Instructions of controls do not make sense, - you will get used to it soon though- you can not put subtitles on or skip cinematics.However, generally, it is a good game. I recommend to play this game before playing Assassins' Creed 2 to enrich understanding of the storyline.			"

												Assassin's Creed can be vaguely compared to the concept of 'The Matrix' in which you play a protagonist in the 'real world' who becomes someone else inside a 'virtual world'. It tells a fictional story of a war between Assassins and Templars - and spans across several real life historic periods. The franchise is one of few - which tells a massive story back-to-back instead of switching main characters half way through or making massive time jumps. Awesome franchise!			"

												Assassin's Creed is a decent game. The game brings a good story and interesting mechanics/concepts along with it. The game has a good story that in itself is reason enough to play. The game falls short in its variation and some elements of the gameplay. The story is interesting and builds up to a semi-expected conclusion. This does not ruin the game though because there is still plenty left unexplained as to the future of where the series will take you and what your actions really mean for the world going forward. The story kept me engaged and interested throughout. The actual gameplay is where this game does not shine. Yes, there are some interesting and fun mechanics. The combat system works well, although counters = godmode. [The game becomes too easy. You can easily fight a mob of 20+ guards and never lose any health].  The game falls flat in terms of its variation. The bulk of the game is made up of the same combination of elements. 1. Go to this city. 2. Gather information. 3. Assassinate. Granted the system works it gets boring quickly. There are no real side missions to speak of and the flag collection system gives you nothing and is not worth the effort. Overall, I still recommend playing the game because of the story. It is worth trduging through the repetitive gameplay to build on the lore of a series that gets better and better as it progresses.

												Assassin's creed is a wonderful adventure game. The enviroment in this game is very realistic and pretty. The game story is very intresting that you sometimes don't want to quit the game. I also like the gameplay itself that you can climp up buildings and jump from roof to roof. The combats are a bit difficult in the beginning but you will lern pretty quickly how to do. I hope when I buy AC 2 that it is even better than the first one.			"

												AC has an excellent story which tackles subjects and presents ideas rarely seen in games these days.  It is delivered in a wonderful package that emulates the platforming/exploration puzzle solving pioneered by the likes of Tomb Raider.Yet it does not share the problem that title has, jarring boss fights which require one to forget all the mechanics one has learned before, where the exploration is left behind and you're boxed in narrow confines, forced to surpass this poor minigame to continue with what the game excels at, exploration.  No, AC's set pieces meld wonderfully with its core game mechanics so that they are looked forward to and a joy to play.However, no game is perfect and AC's repetitive nature for the investigation process does bog down the middle of the game.  Overall, though, a great start to a series.  Looking forward to the next 4 installments (Thanks Steam Summer Sale!).			"

												It looks like Assassins Creed is becoming one of the best games I've played, at least, in a long time. A cliché filled epic that blends history and real locations with a fictional, yet suspenseful storyline. Immersion is the key, and Assassins Creed provides, even (without spoiling too much) in two realms.Graphics wise I didn't expect as much as I got. Even with Antialiasing disabled the game looks vibrant and alive (you can force it on through a text file, default with higher resolutions is 0).As for the controls, I'm guessing it's smoother when played with a pad. Although the pc configuration works, at times it can feel a little sticky.The game has also some informational value; I for one had no idea how huge the city of Jerusalem really was, before I rode to the walls myself.I would suggest this game to anyone who likes open world/action/sneaking games or just medieval themes in general.

												The original Assassin's Creed has set new boundaries for the adventure genre. The parkour and the overall gameplay are simply impressive for a 2008 game.I've only played this game in 2014 because I wanted to get into the AC series and figured AC1 was the first step I should take. Although it is EXTREMELY repetitive, it's a game I'm willing to finish 100% if I ever have the time. If not, I'll just complete the Story.It's worth adding that, although I have not reached the game's ending, I've already found a plethora of collectibles. Be it small flags or side missions, this game has a lot of that kind of extras.All in all, AC1, despite lacking in variety, has re-defined the adventure/action genre in a way that is yet to be seen in any other game outside of the AC series. Or so I think.			"

												Its a great game and most of the reviews will attest this. So I'll just skip to the cons:1. Controls - Have you ever played Prince of Persia Warrior Within? well this game is worse than that. And considering you have two ""stances"" available, high profile moves and low profile moves, neither of which is very intuitive or responsive, it's twice as bad.The protagonist will randomly climb walls, jump into water or not grag a ledge. During fight scenes he may completely ignore a defensive stance at the beginning. And some of the combat mechanices like counter (by far the most important one) are flaky at best.And the PC controller neeeds to be selected in the options menu everytime for it to work.2. NPC - There are some deliberately annoying NPCs like beggars, drunks and lunatics that will try their best to get in your way and slow you down. I have no idea why this was included in the gameplay and why so frequently.3. Menu - Its got a menu screen at startup, and a menu screen within the game. Mildly annoying.However a definite must to get onto the AC bandwagon.			"

												The first in the great series of Blockbuster Assassin's Creed games. This first game isn't really great when it comes to Gameplay. You need to assasinate 9 people, but before you can do those missions, you need to interrogate, steal items or rescue someone that has information about your target. What it boils down to, is that you do the same thing 9 times. Combine this with a lacking combat system and you would say this is a piece of sh*t. But, what makes this game great are two things; Atmosphere and Story. Especially the dual story; you constantly want to know what's happening on the other side of the Animus, no matter which story you're in. It's powerful, mysterious and I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to start playing Assassin's Creed games. It's one of the least enjoyable Assassin's Creed games, but it is still interesting and a great starting point for the blockbuster franchise.			"

I have never been a fan of the series but never actually played any of them through the whole story. After completing the game I can definatly say I will be getting the next one! The game is a little repetitive, but I still enjoyed doing the same things over and over again. The parkour elements are pretty awesome but haven't been ported to PC very well (not sure what its like on console). The cutscenes and also some of the fighting are a bit glitchy too, which can be anoying but other than that its really good! Not to difficult to play on a keyboard and mouse if thats a worry and can see some replay value in the game. Overall I would give it a 7 or 8/10.			"

But for an 2008 game it is fantastic and still holds as one of the better games out even in 2014. The graphics are amazing, the combat is fun and skillful, but the kill then run then hide gets very repetive and tiring. The reason this didn't get 10/10 is because of the repetiveness and because how quickly Altair changed. He became a badass, listen to no one guy to an Enlightened, I understand why my actions are wrong kind of guy in almost a blink of an eye.			"

That said, Altair is one of the more interesting and mysterious characters in the series and it's worth seeing his roots if you really enjoy the overall story.The 'present day' story with Desmond is also essential to the following games, and the cryptic clues presented in the first title are some of the best in the series, IMO.If you want a solid foundation for the series or are just looking to pad out your collection to have all the games, the original Assassin's Creed is still worth picking up.

												I want to like this game I really do, but its just such a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor job of converting it to pc its unforgivable. Firstly it takes 4 menus 2 load screen and a conformation box to exit the game, which in all take about 40 secconds.The HUD is crap, its an xbox dpad, useless for a 1234 keyboard layout.the controls fair no better, it is a littral mapping of pad A = LMB, etceach button does about 3 things depending if your holding control or shift, I have 152 keys let me use them!Aside from that, the game is pretty slow paced, building up to the assisintations, which isn't as bad as it seems, despite the game trying it's best to make movement not feel slow, becomes a chore.It does have some spark to it, the climing animations is fanstasticly well done, and fighting is enjoyable, but you have very little connection with  the enviroment around you, nothing ever changes or progresses, making playing it seem pointless.

												If you played Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag before trying this game, you are going to be dissatisfied with the controller layout and overall feel of the game. But storyline-wise, PLAY IT.If you are like me and love playing console originals that have been ported to PC with a controller, then I would not suggest sitting too far away from the screen with this game. When it says partial controller support, it means it. The first time you run the game you are gonna be required to use the keyboard and mouse to skip the long intro cutscene (you are gonna want to do this every time you run it actually) and to actually get to the main menu. After that, you gonna need to re-map ALL of the controls. The triggers don't register, so use the bumpers instead. Not to mention, if you are indeed coming from some of the later AC's, the combat and parkour system will feel VERY sluggish/non-responsive. But this is the first game: of course it will be that way.Beyond that, the game is awesome so far. The storyline, I will agree, is VERY repetitive, but pay attention to the meetings with the leader. This is definitely where they introduce the Templars and WHY the Assassins hate them. Not to mention, you start to see the changes in both Altaïr and Desmond with every meeting / Animus break.Okay, time for my little goings-on about the graphics.While not as intensive as Black Flag, the graphics for AC1 are both crisp and pretty detailed given when the game was published.Overall, 9/10 because of repetitiveness. Granted, basically having the job of ""Hitman"" would be pretty repetitive - ""Go here. Kill this guy. Come back unseen.""			"

												I've had so many problems with this game, I have the Titan video card 6 GB and even with all the graphic driver updates as well as  game updates not to mention verify integrity of game cash as well as register with Uplay  and still have problems so I start the mission and  I can see the background I can see a cloud and so forth but when I walked towards and individual to complete a specific function Let's say like stabbing them or trying to move them out of the way.  The background in the game disappears transparent than only ladders and pillars or floor stones remain visible everything else is transparent drives me nuts, right click then left click on delete local content equals waste of money not to mention that there's no such thing as a Crouch key or Sprinting,  And OK so they want me to hold down my right mouse button, then hold down the letter "" S "" so that I can sprint and then touched the space bar to jump.. then press the A to interact to slash locking mechanism, just for a thought maybe this game should not be for PC use a consul OMFG...The game has been specifically ported to PC from consul.

												First Assassin's creed.I liked running around and the stealth portions however I have to say that sitting down in some areas and having to listen in on conversations is not so fun. The main character has an out of place accent, and the portions in which you must play as a character beyond Altair get boring.Game has problems with pacing, but overall I'd recommend this game. It's interesting and I enjoyed it.			"

												BLUF: Interesting story, however characters hold little weight. Relatively repetitive, little replay value. Good starting point into AC Universe, but with no multiplayer or branching story, and little in the way of customization, there is no need to replay the game unless one is looking for deeper meaning in the story. The more recent AC games have also perfected the formula. 8/10*********************************************************************************************************************************As the introduction to a now well known and defined franchise by Ubisoft {France and other studios}, Assassin's Creed™ is the cornerstone entry into now what has become Ubisoft's flagship brand. Assassin's Creed™: Director's Cut is the quintessential version of that cornerstone. Ultimately, the game is fun to play to an extent. For those lost in the annals of the Assassin's Creed universe, this game is a great stepping stone to move into the now popular ""revenge, passion, and growth"" storylines that permeate the modern AC entries. For fans of Ubisoft's work, it can serve as an interesting look back at the mechanics and storytelling that launched a new IP. However, I would like to stress that this game is not like its future bretheren. The game has little in the way of customization of either character or playstyle. The unlocks are given at defined intervals and there is significant travel time between mission sets. The gameplay is repetitive, taking place through a variety of event types that ultimately lead you up to an extended mission with a difficult situation to overcome tactically. However there is no replay value, as the missions do not change. The graphics are dated 7 years later, and the Director's Cut content does not add anything that changes the way the mission sets play out. I do want to note that the game places much of stress onto players to approach situations how they want while being given the tools to do so. Two of the 6-8 side missions are required for the player to approach the set-ending assasination attempt, which leaves it to the player to decide how much preparation they want to place behind their precision. The future entries in the AC Universe certainly distill this methodology of player agency and expand on it, incorporating the side missions into the main story, therefore lengthening the story and making the work up to an assassination attempt significant in a different way. I would also like to stress that the story is different as well. The story for AC was developed following the loose adaptation of Vladimir Bartol's Alamut. The story is not the typified AC norm (emotionally scarring event that leads the protagonist into a catharsis, forging the character and leading to the emergence of an assassin moving to vanquish those who wronged him/her/the brotherhood) The Assassin v. Templar threat is not well fleshed out here in the meta-story either. However, these are tropes left to the rest of the franchise to carry out. I argue that this story line is the last one that has significant interpretation that can be administered. Although containing franchise staples such as revenge and freedom, the epiphany here takes the length of the game, and the true value is in the growth of the main character, not in the vanquishing of the main antagonist. The assassination's in the mean time serve as the vehicles that propel the character to the objective, without becoming the objectives themselves. It is here that the story shines, even though it is an adaptation of a story written in 1938.Despite it's flaws, Assassin's Creed™ is a title that enthusiasts and beginners can both pick up and enjoy with the only draws being the repetitive nature of the mechanics. I love the game and certainly suggest it to all interested. With it's interesting and well written story, and fun gameplay with appropriate twists, this title earns and keeps it's place as the birthplace of AC and one of Ubisoft's riskier and profitible entries. 8/10**It should be noted that Ubisoft took a financial hit in developing AC, losing a significant amount to a lack of sales driven by the release of this as a new IP and the lack of heavy marketing that Ubisoft now relies on. Ironically, the game's mechanics and models have been copied into many of Ubisoft's other IPs and has created an extremely successful franchise that is soon seeing it's next installments in AC: Unity and AC: Rogue, bringing the total number of console/PC AC properties to 8. Vladimir Bartol would be proud.**			"

												**Assassin's Creed** should be considered a classic in *stealth* games in myopinion. There aren't many games out there, executing and implementing themeaning of a stealh game in such a good and interesting way as the**Assassin's Creed** series, but even so the first *AC* has its flaws.Considering that the game is from *2008*, the graphics are actually prettygood and the level design is really awesome and feels authentic (I don'tactually know in how far they're authentic to the original cities, but theysure look good and feel realistic).The story is really awesome and interesting, leading you, the player, to thinkfor yourself which side you prefer or rather whose cause is right and whose iswrong.As I said previously *AC* isn't without its flaws either. Some of the*challenge* missions you get throughout the city aren't really that differentfrom your average mission, just that there is a timer running now and they seemto be added just before release because it is simply weird that Altair doesn'tseem to respond or say anything to them. Totally one-sided discussion.The investigation part quickly becomes boring as it always follows the samepattern and it doesn't really add that much to the story of the game. So Iactually have to say that trying to get 100% in every memory is actually awaste of time as it doesn't really add much value to your overall gameplay oryour understanding of the game world.What I absolutely don't like also is that you as a player can't really decidefor yourself how you want to accomplish a mission. I personally would muchprefer to eliminate my targets without any suspects or at least without thewhole city knowing about it immediately but the game doesn't give you any realoption. That makes the missions still pretty linear, the only thing is that youcan somewhat decide from where you will strike, the end-result will stay thesame.Even though *AC* has its flaws, it also has many positives and I can onlyrecommend this game.

The graphics on this game is probably the best in the series, the missions are challenging and the way you synch with your ancestor is interesting as well.On the down side, the combat system isn't very good, and along with the depressing free-running and the ability to NOT swim, it's tipped on both scales to say weather or not this is a good game.

												Good game.  I give it a 8/10.  Remarkable for the visuals for a game from 2007.  Looses points for being repetitve and having a camera that you want to kill during combat.  Some points come back for having an intriguing back story.  I didn't realize this is a trilogy with a long story.  I figured it was just run and gun.  Intrigued for AC2.  I stalled out on this game in chapter 2 of 7, mostly due to the repetion, but got going again after seeing an AC4 trailer.  Took about 24 hours total to get through the game.  This is a pretty good stealth game, which is in my wheel house.  The combat is fun, but a bit non-intuitive and timing dependant.  After you get the hang of it though you pretty much can't loose.

												For all it's flaws it's a masterpiece. While it was repetitive, the story was captivating. The side quests were virtually useless, however (the flags...). There was no real customization, but it was cool to explore regardless. While a lot of players did not finish the game due to it's repitition, I encourage everyone to play it for the story alone.

												Pretty safe to say that this series didn’t really begin until ACII. The last 2 hours of the game is nothing but fights against groups of enemies with a terribly bare-bones combat system that doesn’t suit group combat. And it shoots the pacing to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Worth experiencing how the series started, though.			"

												Excellent game. Don't let the usual reviews talking about how the game is 'repetitive' and 'boring' dissuade you from buying the game - it's absolutely fantastic. Gorgeous visuals (Wide open spaces, massive detailed cities, lots of NPCs in one city at the same time, ...), excellent gameplay, and an intuitive and extremely interesting set of control schemes.

Play offline (switch the modem off otherwise you'll freeze the game for 3-4 secondos every time you kill someone)...why? Because Ubisoft's baby's trying to call home, but their servers aren't up 'n running anymore, so it lags. Sucks!			"

												I will be honest, this game is pretty old, the graphics isn't that great compared to modern games, the gameplay isn't fully developed in my opinion. The story though is pretty good and interesting, and if you'd like to understand better the rest of the Assassin's Creed franchise this game has an important role.			"

												Reading many reviews of this game, I understand how fortunate I was to have played, or better said, lived through the original Assassin's Creed without reading any reviews beforehand. I enjoyed the game totally oblivious to the ""well known facts"" that it is redundant, buggy, too easy, and has a confusing ending. I just bought it, started playing and fell out of reality for a week, and loved every minute of it, except the ending - it was really sad to realise that it was finished and I couldn't play any more.I must admit I'm not a ""gamer"", I enjoy games since my childhood, but I do not play them professionally, and I'm more on the intellectual side. I get bored with shallow keyboard-smashing action titles, and more appreciate a solid story and an adventure that allows me to use logic to solve the problem. I've never played games like Assassin's Creed before (were there any?), so I was totally blown away. I found it very similar to the original Prince of Persia from 1990, the same cinematic movement animations, same classic approach to a level-based story progression. One fight was a bit too hard for me, but I generally loved the idea of not dying. Since it was a memory, I could not really die - desynchronisation merely meant I was not doing it right. Psychologically it's somehow easier for me than getting actually killed. This game is much more logical than its sequels - here you live through a genetic memory of an ancestor, and you have to follow it very closely. In the sequels you had much more freedom, you could buy property, get various weapons, heal yourself, dress in fancy clothes through uPlay rewards (sometimes losing a finger), visit same place during a day or night - that really broke the concept of a DNA memory and moved the franchise from a science fiction into a non-science... better said: nonsense-fiction genre.I have found the multi-layer matryoshka-like plot, the graphics and Altair so realistic, I was saying sorry to him each time I was clumsy enough to make him fall off a wall :) I don't understand what ""redundancy"" people are talking about. I guess I'm not blessed with a consumer's mind, and to me consistency, integrity of a story is more important than the ""fun value"".So, if anyone hasn't yet played the original Assassin's Creed and makes up his mind by reading my review, I'd say that if you're jumping through the games while chatting to your friends, and you pay no attention to dialogues and story, this one is not for you, and you will be disappointed with it. However, if you immerse into games and live through them, this is something you'll most likely appreciate.			"

												This game is dissapointingly mediocre. HOWEVER It is followed by much greater games!To be honest you could skip this game and start with AC2. Just read the wiki.

Gameplay is a big step down from the other games (not a bad thing really, just means the devs have improved a lot). I would recommend skipping this title, look up the story on the wiki before playing the other games.I think I'm glad I played revelations before this one. Had I played it first, I wouldn't have the dedication to even finish the game, let alone buy the second one.			"

												Assassin's Creed 1 is the starting game for the franchise Assassin's Creed. You play from 2 view points, The modern world where you control Desmond Miles. And in 1191 In the Holy Land where you play as Altair ibn la ahad. The gameplay, and story is very addicting and fun. The fact that you get to murder people where ever you go, and you have side missions, or objectives you get to do throughout the game is awesome. The controls feel very good, and the graphics were good for its time back when it was first released, For any begginers that want to play this game, you may have to sit down for a little and get really comfterable with the controls and becoming aware of your surroundings. Any veterans that have played other Assassin's Creed except this one, you may become frustrated with what they give you in this game, but otherwise you might really enjoy this game. Except for a few thing which is the repetitive gameplay that is in this game. I don't mind it, but after a while you really wished there was more things to do. Oh and the informer challenege can ♥♥♥♥ right off. I would recommend this game to begginers wanting to get into the assassin's creed franchise and want to start from the beggining, but for some veteran assassin creed players, it may seem boring because of its repetitive investigation. 8.5/10 - Fun as ♥♥♥♥ but some boring repetitive gameplay			"

												There is no doubt that the first of the AC games is an unpolished gem. The repetitive side-missions, journeying around, and over-alert guards are pretty annoying, but the story (the Assassin stuff in the Holy Land, not the futuristic pseudo-science ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t) is pretty good and the actual assassinations are rather fun. It's just everything else is kinda... bleh. I started the series with AC2 and that was alright, though this being the start of the story makes it a natural place to start playing these games. The  sequels vastly improve the gameplay though, so keep that in mind if you plan to check out the entire series, start with this, and get irritated at all the little stuff that gets in the way of making this a great game. Overall, this gets a recommendation from me... barely. And only because it is a stepping stone to the much better sequels.			"

												Recently Bought this game and the next three AC games off the Christmas Steam sale, and I'd say it was sincerely worth it. Now, this game might not seem cool at all if you've played the later Assassin's Creed games such as Black Flag, but if you're just starting, I highly recommend starting here, at ground zero. For me, the combat system was revolutionary, compared to Ubisoft's similar game series ""Prince of Persia,"" it was a major jump. The fact that the city environments in the game are completely open-ended are also an awesome addition. It helps add a realistic element and shows you the effort put into the virtual environment. Now, I personally loved following both story lines, but that may or may not be interesting at all to you. In the event that it isn't, there's plenty of gory combat and backstabbing to cure the itch. So, do I recommend this game, YES. Though it doesn't have a very high replay value, its got great combat and plus, it's the only Assassin's Creed game that saves you having to get Uplay, which can be a little difficult.			"

												The original AC was more of a tech demo than a proper game, but still has some good aspects that some people might desire. +The environments are lovely, if a bit whitewashed, and the game runs buttery smooth 60FPS max settings even on my 6-year old hardware.+Combat is MUCH harder than in the sequels; if you get cornered with 4+ guards surrounding you, you're screwed. Counterkills still exist, but the chain kills introduced in Brotherhood are not, which I like.+This game is much more stealth-oriented than the sequels. If you alert your target, not only are they difficult to kill in a straight fight, you will very quickly get surrounded by guards and have your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you.+You are encouraged to obtain useful information about your target and ways you can take them out, whether it's a map of patrol routes or a hiding place to jump out from. These are obtained by completing side missions (see below for why this is a bad thing).There are quite a few problems with this game though:-Doesn't play nice with controllers; every time you turn on the game it defaults to KB/M, so you have to go into the options menu to switch to controller every time.-Unnecessarily convoluted game exiting. To leave you have to exit the animus, then quit. Took me too long to figure that out.-Combat can sometimes be slow to respond which, considering how lethal fighting is and the fact that you don't have medicine to heal mid-combat, can be a death sentence.-NO FAST CLIMBING. The godsend of AC2 over the original was being able to climb nonstop hand over hand. With AC 1, you will stop at every move, then move to the next area. Makes traversing areas painfully slow if you've played any of the other games which feature this faster climbing.-Altair's voice is plainly American, while everyone else in the Animus has period appropriate accents. Very immersion-breaking.-Guards sometimes detect and attack you for no apparent reason, so it's best to avoid any areas with guards entirely, or try to blend through them. This doesn't always work for some reason though.-Very little story. Go kill these guys, then something happens at the end that sets up for AC2 (significantly better).-PLEASE SIR, CAN YOU SPARE ANY MONEYY!?!?Overall, if you really want to experience the series from the beginning, it does have some nice aspects, but if you've already played the others it will be very hard to go back and deal with the archaic combat and freeclimbing systems.

Uma coisa que vai te fazer ficar de saco cheio são os pedintes nas ruas, eles perturbam demais e atrapalham em algumas missões o que torna o jogo ainda mais desafiador em alguns momentos.Gostei muito do jogo e recomendo para quem gosta desse estilo.Nota:9.0/10.0			"

												I've been meaning to finish this game for a while now. I played Assasin's Creed II first and absolutely loved it. I still haven't completed this one, but I'll get to it some day. From what I can remember, I enjoyed it. Sorry for not being able to give more details.I will say one thing though: the minimap is rubbish. It doesn't show the outline of any buildings so you can't use it for navigation at all, unlike the second game's minimap. From what I can recall, the minimap is basically a circle with cardinal directions wirrten on it with a opqaue background inside that contains a load of markers for quests and whatnot that the minimap if of no use in getting to.

												When I first played this game, I was very disappointed. First of all, I wasn't playing Ezio, which really bugged me because I knew nothing about the other assassins; second, I was VERY confused by the way they incorporated the Animus into the game, and had you switch between history and modern times. And finally, it can be pretty damn frustrating to have to walk across an entire city to simply avoid alerting guards; those cities are huge, man! But after I was about half-way through, I began to appreciate it. Altair is, in fact, a really bad♥♥♥♥♥assassin, and the switch between modernity and history actually makes more sense in this game than it does in the others. Though you need to be a paitent player to enjoy this game, I think it was worth every hour I put into it.			"

												This game is pretty amazing. Even though its about 6 years old now, you would never think so from the graphics. You really feel like you're an assassin in every sense of the word. The missions can get difficult at times but they are few and far between. The story itself is interesting to a point as well. The cities are beautifully done and you can tell untold hours of historical research went into this game.  The voice acting is very good. The random uses of real Arabic and German (among others?) was a welcomed surprise and made the game feel very authentic to the time and place.The only gripes I would have with the game are 2 things; one more important than the other. 1. The way to exit the game without using Alt+F4 takes forever and is really unneccesarily annoying (More important one).2. Sometimes the camera can get really stuck at weird angles but with a little mouse and keyboard work, its very negligable. This game is definently worth every penny.			"

												TLDR: Great story and medieval atmosphere, best style of graphics, missions are repeating and boring.Here it beggan. Very first instalment in famous series. But question is: can it be still interesting after those years and the hoard of newer ""brothers"". Sumprisingly it can. 2 stories are combined - each depicting battle between templars and assassins. Of course, only very little is said about present (future) story of Desmond and his story is more developed in other games. Main is Altair story - full of autentic medieval atmosphere. That is for me main reason playing this game. Even graphics are somhow rough (better then ACII ""fairy tale"" graphics), making it somehow realistic. Biggest downfall of this game is of course stereotype ... missions are except killer contracts really same and you will lost interest whyile doing third time that same thing again. Chasing, climbing, running, protecting, ... It will get boring. To summarize: AC is great game for all medieval lovers and people who are interested in all aspects of AC story. But expect to be given often stereotype and boring missions.			"

												You play a character who is playing a character in a virtual reality matrix like mind game which seems to have real world repercussions. Your player characters, player character exceeds expectations in killing and has a really boring side hobby for collecting flags, that do little to enhance the experience. Well I player through the entire game and still don't see the reason for getting these things. Your Player character themselves, exceeds in being able to sleep knowing they will soon be killed (A difficult skill) and they have a vision mode like the light csi use. You mainly play the player characters, player character which is an Assassin. The first 6 hours of the game repeats itself two more times. Sadly about halfway through you stop getting cool stuff to make this grind feel less like a grind. Would it have been too much to ask for a sword that was strong enough to occassionally snap enemies swords in half...The promise of being an assassin is not delivered as it is in games such as Hitman. If you instead think of yourself as a ""Knight""/""Ranger"" or at best ""Rogue"" things make a little more sense. Don't expect to be doing any of the following assassin tricks.* Dripping poison into the mouth a deep sleeping target* Poison capsules in the wine. (Someone does poison wine, but it is not you)* Accidental or false flag death situations* Wearing a disguise* Hiding bodies* Being able to sneak passed the guards of those you are seeking to assassinate without having to take them all head on.. Kind of like a ""Knight"" or a ""Ranger/Rogue""Ball and all an interesting, but drawn out experience, that is drawn out even more by unskippable wordy monologues.You may feel uneasy about the content and religious context if you are impacted by such things, but don't worry, everyone on the team were from different backgrounds, and I believe the game is saying that if they put up with it... So should you.			"

												Back when this game came out, it was a breakthrough in game ideas, but nowadays, it's rather simplistic.  Time and again the player explores one of 3 sections of a couple of cities, synchronizing at viewpoints to locate the same menial tasks over and over so they can play the one significant mission of the segment.  The story lasts around 8 hours, so when this game is on sale, you'll definitely get your money's worth, but otherwise I wouldn't call it worthwhile.  For newcomers to the series, it's not necessary to play this game to understand the rest.			"

While the game's biggest issue is repetitive gameplay, the story, combat and movement mechanics, sound, and graphical style kept me coming back again and again, anxious to see the battle between Assassins and Templars to the very end.  Assassin's Creed is a sci-fi conspiracy theorist's fantasy with an interesting injection of historical fiction and definitely worth checking out.			"

												Assassin's Creed is a decent game. The game brings a good story and interesting mechanics/concepts along with it. The game has a good story that in itself is reason enough to play. The game falls short in its variation and some elements of the gameplay. The story is interesting and builds up to a semi-expected conclusion. This does not ruin the game though because there is still plenty left unexplained as to the future of where the series will take you and what your actions really mean for the world going forward. The story kept me engaged and interested throughout. The actual gameplay is where this game does not shine. Yes, there are some interesting and fun mechanics. The combat system works well, although counters = godmode. [The game becomes too easy. You can easily fight a mob of 20+ guards and never lose any health].  The game falls flat in terms of its variation. The bulk of the game is made up of the same combination of elements. 1. Go to this city. 2. Gather information. 3. Assassinate. Granted the system works it gets boring quickly. There are no real side missions to speak of and the flag collection system gives you nothing and is not worth the effort. Overall, I still recommend playing the game because of the story. It is worth trduging through the repetitive gameplay to build on the lore of a series that gets better and better as it progresses.

But you must not forget that this is the first game in the AC franchise and so it is a bit unpolished and its sequels ar better in one more aspects, but again not all agree on this question.

												Bad points first - The missions are almost identical, turn up, do minimum of three from a mostly boring selection of mini assassination missions, collecting flags, eavesdropping, pickpocketing etc, get the go ahead to assassinate the 'boss', see your leader for an upgrade, rinse and repeat. Some of the tasks weren't worth including, eavesdropping for example is sitting on the nearest bench and pressing a button. The 'kingdon' between cities was a wasted opportunity and may as well be skipped unless you're looking for flags and templars. The assassinations themselves can rarely be carried out in the delicate stealthy way you might imagine, more often than not you end up fighting half a dozen or more to get away to a rooftop. The mental people and beggars get annoying quickly with the same sound clips over and over again so I ended up spending most of the game on the rooftops to avoid them, missing out on a lot of the city and feel at ground level. The Desmond parts could have included more backstory and the two doctors got boring quickly. Good - Looks great, I bought it in a sale last year and for a game so old it looks superb. The free running is well executed and something I never got bored of, nothing like seeing two or three steps ahead when running away from guards across the rooftops. Because it can be had so cheaply in sales, and if you take the fastest route possible completed in a handful of hours I would recommend it as part of the AC saga.			"

												Great game. Honestly though, I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price. Wait until it's on sale. It does connect with AC2 but if you skip this game and go straight to 2, you're honestly not missing much. You might be a little confused with the story but as you progress you'll get the gist. If you like to feel immersed in the story as I do, I recommend buying it but buy it on sale. If you're just looking to purchase an Assassin's Creed game, I'd say go with AC2 or Black Flag.The character does not move fluidly. You'll find yourself jumping to the wrong thing, trying to run up a wall where you should've grabbed the ledge, not climbing onto the roof where you should be able to, getting out of a hiding spot only to find yourself climbing onto the edge of the hiding spot, sometimes you'll refuse to climb onto a viewpoint. The missions are repetitive. You do the same thing in every city in every chapter while the cities mostly look the same. The main characters voice is absolutely terrible. Comming from the Holy Land, you would think a dude named Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad would have a middle eastern accent as ezio has an italian accent. NOPE, you're a white dude.If you don't care about feeling immersed, read the wiki on ac then skip to ac2 and go from there.			"

												-If landing in hay bales kills you enable vsync-Each game is like a story expansion of the one before it, with some extra new bits that sometimes are fun, but other times just get in the way. I'm glad they're taking a year off. They need it. That said, this is one of my favorite series. Its like medieval GTA. The writing and story ideas I enjoy a lot. The first game will seem pretty bland if you've played anything newer. But I liked this era the most and Altair is my favorite.I'd say pick it up on a deal if you're iffy about something a little aged with some repeated aspects throughout the whole game. 20 is kinda steep. If you didn't play it way back when, it might be a tough fit. But I can't really bring myself not to recommend just out of enjoying the philosophy of it.			"

												Assassin's Creed is one of those gems that, in my opinion, was a good departure from Prince of Persia. Having played all the Princes, the storyline of Assassin's Creed hooked me immediately! It blended historical fact-fiction with some modern ideas, and because I am a sucker for conspiracy theories, the whole idea of a corporation exploiting individuals for some 'thing of power' grabbed me completely. I was an Assassin, going from city to city, killing the evil do'ers and saving mankind.What did I like? The graphics for its time was superb, a testament to dedicated artists showing their trait. It still kind of stands up even today and even though we have become numb to 4K and HDR, the quality of the work that went into this game was tremendous.  As I said, the story was brilliant and intriguing.  The battle sequences made you feel mighty and in control.What didn't I like? I think the scope of the game was fantastic for its time, but the gameplay could get somewhat repetive.  The locations were brilliantly done, but after a while all the alleys and soldiers started looking the same.  The game tried to mix things up by giving you different ways to approach a kill, but in the end, you just needed to damage the boss enough to win.  No assassation needed!  This I didn't like so much.A true start to a great series.			"

												This is the first installment of the series I've played and it's a good introduction so far. The game is well-made for PC and runs very well. The controls are a bit meh, only because they made it with consoles in mind first. It still plays well, it's just that they're console-y. Hopefully the issues with Unity are resolved, as I plan on buying the rest of the games and playing them in order.			"

												The Good: Amazing story, beautifully created visually and technically, lots of different missions to complete, parkour and crowd system are unique and revolutionary, DirectX 10 looks greatThe Bad: Some control and clipping issues, extremely repetitive missions, not very diverse visually, crowd simulation gets predictable and repetitiveNothing is true. Everything is permitted. This is a saying heard throughout Assassin's Creed and it really sticks with you. So does the thick plot that has come to take the game industry by storm as well as one of the greatest game characters of all time: Altair. The plot is actually weird at first because it's a sci-fi story. You are actually Desmond Miles capture by modern world Templars. They stick you in an Animus and use your DNA to access your ancestors memories to find the Piece of Eden which can be used to control people's minds. That one ancestor is Altair set during the crusades. The second story is of Altair who ends up losing his rank and status among the Assassin Brotherhood by failing a mission due to eagerness and stupidity. Your master, Al Mualim, sends on special missions to assassinate key leaders throughout the holy land (Acre, Jerusalem, and Damascus) to keep them from taking the Piece of Eden and using it to win the war.As you can see the plot is very interesting with a lot of twists. How is the game though? You have a huge open world that are full of side missions and hundreds of buildings to climb. Assassin's Creed has a parkour climbing system as well as a puppeteering system. You control each of Altair's limbs in two different states. The ""socially acceptable"" state allows you to use eagle vision which can show enemies and key targets. You can gently push people away from you and this is key because is you're running around the city knocking people over the guards will come after you, and towards the end of the game everyone is highly suspicious of you and just a few people knocked over will have the entire guard on your tail. The third thing is obviously combat, but if you hold down the run button you start climbing buildings, grabbing people to toss them, and jumping around.Assassin's Creed really tried to introduce crowd psychology into the game and it works here, but does feel limited. If you climb buildings people will react by stopping and staring and saying things accordingly. If you use ladders people don't mind so much. While using rooftops is faster and keeps you away from most guards you must watch out for guards on rooftops who will shoot you with arrows if you don't get down, kill them, or move away quickly. The climbing works well enough, but there are some controls issues, clipping issues, and other issues with the camera. When Altair is facing a different way then the camera he will jump towards his way instead of the way you're telling him too. Also, if you run around a pole or near a crate he'll start climbing it instead of just jumping over or going around. This can get down right frustrating when you are running away from a dozen guards and trying to find a hiding spot.The game also introduces anonymity via a symbol near your health bar which stays white when no ones suspects you, but will turn yellow when you are watched and flash red when guards are on to you. When it does this get away quickly or kill whomever is watching you. Don't just kill out in the open or people will run around screaming and call guards. Get away from dead bodies quickly because guards will come by and try to find who killed them or citizens will give you away. If you are caught you need to kill all guards after you or hide. To do this you must break their line of sight and the symbol will flash yellow. When it does find a hiding spot quickly before it turns red again. You can hide on benches between people, stacks of hay, in groups of monks praying, or draped boxes on rooftops. Stay there for a few seconds and you will by anonymous again. You can avoid all this chaos by just jogging, staying calm, don't flail around and jump around like a monkey in crowded areas etc.This whole crowd system is really something else and works well, but feels repetitive and predictable because of the recycled sayings, animations, and it always happens the same way. The combat is the same way because while you can gain new abilities it feels like a counter fest. You can attack with a sword or short sword, throw daggers, but most guards always block and you just stand there with the block button held down and wait for someone to attack and then counter which is usually an instant kill. This gets repetitive and the combat isn't as deep as it could be since combos are limited, and animations are repeated often. It does control well and feels smooth so I guess that's better than broken.The most repetitive thing, and the game's biggest flaw, are the constantly repeated missions that repeat dozens and dozens of times. You can save citizens, do some time trial flag gathering missions, escort missions, assassination missions (probably the most fun), interrogation, eavesdropping, pickpocketing, and climbing tall buildings to find view points to put more missions on your map in that area. Sure they are fun at first, but after you have saved the 30th citizen, or climbed the 50th building it gets old and you just want it to end. Some more mission diversity would have been nice.While its cool to be an assassin, sneaking up behind a guard and shoving a punch dagger in his gut, and then running away while he falls to the ground without anyone suspecting otherwise is satisfying you must look good doing it too. Assassin's Creed looks amazing, even today, and the PC version sports DirectX 10 graphics with some slightly higher resolution textures. The game looks a lot better than console versions and is well worth another play through just for that alone. While the graphics are amazing technically, artistically the game feels very Middle Eastern with a great soundtrack to support that, voice acting, and the whole game feels true to its time. The architecture is great, the clothing, lifestyles, and jobs people do in the game, but it all does kind of look the same with a lot of greys, browns, and whites.Overall Assassin's Creed is an amazing experience with a story you will talk about long after you finish the game, great crowd simulation, and the true feeling of being an assassin. If there was some more mission diversity, visual diversity, and smoother controls the game would be perfect. This is a game you can not miss and every gaming fan should play this.~Score: 8.5/10			"

												Absolutely top-notch game. The visual presentation is leagues beyond it's time, looks better than most games of 2011. Movement system is nearly flawless and effortlessly thrilling. The storyline is engaging and combat is extremely satisfying. One of the best games ever made and a must-have for anyone who enjoys good combat, rpg, or parkour movement.			"

												Assassins creed has many awesome mechanics and a very interesting story.However, the mechanics mostly fail and the story is extremely predictable.The combat goes from extremely difficult to super easy after the first mission. The freerunning often causes you to jump off random ledges killing yourself, the set up missions are extremely boring and repetative, and the world - being set up in the middle east - looks like a poorly textured sand dune. Here is why I recommend this game: The story, while predictable, is great. Its extremely interesting and it sets up the world fantastically, the side characters are well developed and have strong motivations, and while the set up missions are boring and repetative, the main missions are interesting and pretty solid. Im really hoping that as the series develops the mechanics tighten up and the story continues in a similar fashion, but with less predictablity. The only thing that I would change is I would add a stealth mechanic. The missions could be far more interesting with one.If you are interested in playing I would recommend just doing the minimum amount of set up missions per area and rushing through the game and enjoying the story. Im only a few hours in Assassins Creed 2, but most of my complaints are answered by it so far. I give it a 4/10. Blamo.			"

												Assassin's Creed is a game that got so much right, it paved a golden path for its awesome sequels… but it’s one big flaw marred it enough that it falls short of gaming perfection and many have chided it for this.  That flaw was repetition… for such a vast and beautiful recreation of the Holy Land… and for the total awesomeness it is to be an Assassin, the variety of things to do available is meager in comparison.Overall, I highly recommend this game… but more for the story than for the gameplay.  Finish the story all the way and then go play Assassin's Creed II for both the story and the far superior gameplay and variety.  The production value on these games is so high, it’s worth it. "

But I succeeded, so I went to see the first guy and first thing he said was ""You are lucky""			"

												Assassin's Creed feels repetitive and unrefined compared to its successors, but this is an unfair criticism considering that the game came out right at the start of the last console generation and did so many things right. The PC version has gorgeous textures and DX11 effects that still hold up today (the game actually looks better than Assassin's Creed 2), and the Middle-Eastern setting is fun to explore.			"

In one of the Bureaus, I am unable to leave after the cutscene is over. As you can imagine, this is very frustrating. I've tried quitting and reopening the program, I've tried leaving and re-entering the Animus, I've tried rebooting. Nothing's working. Time to read a plot synopsis and move on to AC 2.			"

												The first in the great series of Blockbuster Assassin's Creed games. This first game isn't really great when it comes to Gameplay. You need to assasinate 9 people, but before you can do those missions, you need to interrogate, steal items or rescue someone that has information about your target. What it boils down to, is that you do the same thing 9 times. Combine this with a lacking combat system and you would say this is a piece of sh*t. But, what makes this game great are two things; Atmosphere and Story. Especially the dual story; you constantly want to know what's happening on the other side of the Animus, no matter which story you're in. It's powerful, mysterious and I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to start playing Assassin's Creed games. It's one of the least enjoyable Assassin's Creed games, but it is still interesting and a great starting point for the blockbuster franchise.			"

												I came to AC just as AC4 was being released, so I knew that the critics hated the first and liked/loved the 2nd and its derivatives. I also knew how well the original had sold and thought that it couldn't be too bad.1 hour in and I thought the game was awesome2 hours in and I'd already hit the repetitiveness... I was thinking about dropping the game. However, since i wanted to play number 2 i persevered for the sake of the story and this changed the way I played. Usually i'd be slow and deliberate in games like this, making sure that I completed everything. Now that I didn't care I raced through the cities, attacking guards wantonly and suddenly I found i was having a really fun time.Fighting large groups really makes you feel powerful as the counter style combat is fluid and, while not overly forgiving, it's not too 'press the button in this millisecond or die' difficult either.Biggest downside is the central kingdom area where anything slower than a crawl puts the guards on you. Recommend holding gallop the whole way and just mowing everyone down.			"

												I must say very impressive. This game was a lot of fun. I judged it too quickly , I had it for a while, and decided after watching a playthrough of a few levels on youtube I decided maybe I was too hasty. I redownloaded the game and really had a great time. The game can be used with a keyboard... but you will either A. Kill your keyboard or B. Kill your hand. Whichever comes first. I was never good with gamepads but after my hand began to hurt with frustation, I pulled out my pad and really REALLY benefited from it. The Game makes it easy too, since the circles in the upper right mirror the layout of your controller, and change accordingly it allowed me to easily adapt and in doing so become a much better assassin haha. Anyhow highly recommend this game.			"

I would recomend this to anyone who wants a little action and a little platforming.			"

That's the only part that was better than 2.  2 did more of a push you along from mission to mission dealyo while this had more of an open ended feel.  Still, I'd probably give this a pass.  Almost everything else is worse and, for the most part, the game isn't that much fun.  Well, unless you didn't play 2 already.

The gameplay can get quite tiresome towards the middle stages of the game but it's not THAT monotonous as some make it out to be. The storyline is, in my opinion, among the most interesting from any AC game and it served as the basis for many of the games that were to come. I would not say it's a mandatory title in the franchise, but a strongly recommended one. After all these years, it's aged more than well.			"

												Note: First time ever playing assassin's creed, so my views will be based around that.The game as a whole was great. It wasn't incredibly easy, but not very hard either. The parkour was fun but frustrating occasionally due to clunkiness that ended up costing me a life or two.The controls and combat in the game are very unique and different from most other games, which I liked. I felt like an assassin and I definitely had to think about each move I was making or I could end up regretting it.The story was fantastic, and I could definitely understand Al-Tair's feelings. Him, as a person, changed throughout and became a completely different person at the end.Overall, I would give this title a 7/10. It was incredibly fun, but it was repetitive in the long run and had a clunky parkour system. Thankfully, the game is short so it doesn't drag on for long.			"

												People often forget, when talking about the Assassins Creed series, the ambitious story and theme that the first game attempted to sell to a new fan base. This first instalment in the series is often criticised for its repetitive missions and clunky fighting mechanics, fair criticism as well, but what people have missed is that as the series has improved in terms of game play and setting, the intellectual discussion on power and choice has taken a back seat. Gone are the multifaceted antagonists and questionable ethics of the first game. If you want to play a game that asks you whether might makes right and whether murdering somebody is ever a good deed, that questions your moral assumptions, I think you should play this game to the end.

It's almost ten years old and the graphics still hold up, the game's environment was beautiful on release. If you want a better experience, I'd say pick up a later game in the series to get more of your money's worth. But this would for sure be worth it if it was a couple bucks on sale, especially if you're looking to start from the very start of the Assassin's Creed series.			"

												A truly revolutionay game. The locales are vast, exotic, and intriguing. The game does an excellent job of sticking to it's goal: assassinations, but on the side note it is rediculously fun to run around on rooftops and climb towers, churches, mosques, castles, EVERYTHING. It's almost more fun to climb around than actually assassinate the targets. On the negative side, the missions involving finding information about your target are rather redundant and there is no real reward (besides a save point) to spending time looking for all those flags. Also the game requires a powerful machine if played on PC due to it's hardcore spec requirements. Otherwise, a masterful, enchanting, and must-play game			"

												Good game as a basic intro to the massive series.  Quite repetitive, all of the missions are the same.  Besides the obvious laziness of not creating different missions to beat, my only other critique is WHO HAD THE GENIUS IDEA OF NOT HAVING THE ABILITY TO SWIM IN THIS GAME?!?!?			"

												This game does not work on modern PCs.  the only option that worked for me was to run the game in DirectX 9 mode.  Luckily that .exe is offered.  And you cannot launch it from steam without renaming the DirectX9 version to the one that Steam wants to load.  I do not feel the developers should be held responsible for updating their games until the end of time, but Steam should at least display a warning.Altair's voice is some of the worst voice acting I have ever heard to date in all the games I've ever played.  It's painful to listen to.  Most other voices are just ok.  I turn music off so no comment there.  The beggars, guards, and other people are numerous but their voices aren't numerous enough, so you'll hear the same recordings over and over again, though each map has different voices for the same types of people.The controls are a little awkward, and i'm not referring to the difficulty matching up each action to a button.  It actually plays pretty well once you understand the High Profile mode which some people have difficulty adjusting to.  The awkwardness is with the camera angles.  They get stuck a lot in tight places, where you will often find yourself in, and it causes you to stab innocent people or jump off a ledge when you don't intend to.I was hoping the fluidness and abilities would match that of the batman series, but it doesn't at all.  You can't aim the angle in which to throw a person off a ledge, forcing you to line your character up correctly, which may not be possible the way the guards move or other objects that may be in the way.  You can't pounce from a ledge to kill despite the opening sequence alluding that you can.  (You also cannot hide amidst the schollars while being watched as alluded to in the opening sequence as well.)  Hiding only works when you're not watched, which I feel is more real anyway.  You can't extend your hidden blade while swordfighting.  The knife throw and knife slash is the same button, so if they dodge your attack and land too far away, you'll reduce your inventory of throwing knives if you keep smashing the button.  You can pickpocket for more though.  Your character is a bit limited in what it can do.Despite its age, the game holds up pretty well.  the pixellation is apparent in the scenes but the models are full and detailed.  the maps are maze-like and feel like a corridor may or may not be present while running around, and if you run down a dark alley, you may have a 50/50 chance you'll hit a wall and have to fight the people you're facing.  there is plenty of z-axis also.  You'll feel like the maps are quite full.  There is duplication of architecture but it isn't noticeable that much.  the horse riding is also pretty cool and you can fight while riding, though its a little hard to hit anything.  They can knock you off your horse.the guard's senses are better than the Hitman games.  Hitman's character's ability to detect you is good, but this game feels more real.  You can fist fight in front of guards without them caring, so you can get away from the drunks.I got it on sale and its about a fair price then.  Buy it to partake in the storyline or learn the controls and it will help you later in the series.  It's still a good game.			"

												A Flawed Dose of NostalgiaIn 2016, it seemed like to play the original 2007 Assassin's Creed was to revert to the rough draft of the AC formula, but that is where I found myself loving the core gameplay of AC. The first game in the franchise hadn't yet been bogged down with the extra bloat most evident in the later titles like AC Unity, from the challenges and side missions to the rendering of visuals. The seminal Assassin's Creed succeeds today in 2016 because it benefits from being the innovative first in a formulated franchise.The balance between a solid storyline and mindless side activities kept me moving towards finishing the game without feeling like the completionist challenge was unsurmountable (a personal problem I find with modern open-world games). I typically started with viewpoints, moved to ""Save Citizens"" missions, and then began my formal investigation into my assassination target. In my mind, I was learning the city, its people, and then solving the overall problem plaguing them. The objectives could be completed in any manner, but the approach I took felt the most natural for a stranger entering a city.The combat felt great when my timing synced up well,  It felt good to be that overpowered, yet it was too easy and didn't involve much strategy despite being trained in-game with various techniques. Occasionally, I would find myself on-top of various things like market stalls with six other men on the same stall with three other men attempting to climb up to the ""battlefield"" . The AI scripting felt like the enemies were simply and mindlessly piling on. All I had to do was time the counter attack successfully to take out any force.The stealth felt unrefined and was frequently undermined by a stray AI stepping into the shared environment or a drunken NPC shoving me into a group while I was attempting to blend in. While it helped to utilize stealth from time to time, the behaviors which broke my stealth usually threw me into another fifteen man battle. It was most useful when traversing the map to avoid battle engagement, but detrimental to all the investigations crafted into the story when a major assassination would down spiral due to imprecise stealth mechanics. This is best illustrated when I attempted to throw a knife at my target and pressed the lock-on button. It alerted everyone in the arena to my presence with the simple lock-on and a twenty man battle ensued. After bouncing around to various AC games in the past year or so, the GUI in this original game felt so in touch with the premise of the Animus technology. The HUD and in-game menu never appeared gaudy or clunky, but the main menu unnecessarily required me to briefly switch to my mouse to make a character profile selection before I could begin playing with my gamepad. The map was a delight to engage with, but the investigations give the player various map information such as where guards are during the assassination's preceding event and the safest path for extraction after killing the target, that was ultimately undermined by an under-detailed HUD map.I played the original version of Assassin's Creed to completion on PS3 around 2009 and it left a nostalgic feeling in the back of my mind. The nostalgic thirst was quenched with this latest 2016 playthrough on PC, but not without some stumbles along the way that reminded me that some serious gameplay mechanic overhaul occurred in the past 7 years. This game innovated at the time, but was refined greatly with the sequel.			"

												I can't tell the difference between AC 'standard' edition and 'Director's Cut' Edition. The graphics and gameplays are pretty much the same, but some folks on the forum wrote that there are several side missions that you can't find on console version. Gotta check it out.Nonetheless, it sill a great game even 7 years after the first release. MUST PLAY if you want to follow the story's of the assassin from the first.			"

												The gameplay is pretty fun but the combat is very repetitive, as is the majority of the game which pretty much consists of multiple areas of doing similar things over and over.The plot is quite interesting but seems to have too little spread out over the game. There are times where you don't even really think about the game having a plot since you're too busy just doing the tasks in each area, especially if you try and do them all to get al information and help.Overall the game is still fun to play, I'd give it 7.5/10.

												If you like medieval times, hitman, and some platforming added on, you will like AC. The only problem, after a while, it can get a little boring, and you end up just running through it to finish the story,which is not bad either, this game will keep you entertained to the end.			"

												Everything good and fun about this game is also everything that's frustrating.The story is good. The combat is mostly fun. Free running is mostly fun. The ""jump and tackle/stab someone"" move is awesome. But almost all of those have very frustrating moments that get all the more frustrating the more they happen.Lockon is absolute crap. There was moments where I was trying to quickly assassinate someone with a throwing knife and ended up either missing or getting spotted before I could strike. To make matters worse, even if I was spotted but still close enough for a throwing knife kill, the game locks on the closest enemy to me. To enter combat, one must press R to enter combat mode (read: lock on to enemies). This is EXTREMELY frustrating when you're trying to quickly dispatch one or two enemies in your way before moving on (when you're in group of five or more). There are also times you'll think you're fighting only to realize the game didn't automatically enter combat mode for you. It's extremely inconsistent.When on ledges near enemies, there doesn't seem to be away to assassinate your enemy without first awkwardly jumping down and hoping he doesn't hear you (unless you have throwing knives). I once had someone RIGHT in front of me but botched the stealth assassination because I was out of knives and couldn't do the ""jump wrist stab"" move.The assassination get repetitive after awhile. You do the same thing over and over. Get 3 sources of info, report back, assassinate. Get 3 sources of info, report back, assassinate. Et Cetera. The concept is cool, but gets less interesting each time. When given advice on where to investigate, the game doesn't seem to keep a log of the info the local bureau has given you. That never get's annoying. Plus, it seems (from what I've seen) you must re-synchronize every time your told to investiage the ""southeast"" or ""north"" or whatever. That or they expect you to immediately recognize or remember what a Middle-Eastern hostpital looks like. Free running is super fun when it works. It's super frustrating when it doesn't. Altair might jump in the wrong direction, jump too far, not jump far enough, jump into a wall instead of an enemy, jump off a building, etc. This will ruin a lot of missions for you, or make them take longer.Also annoying is when drunk and crazy people in the streets push you into others and you're chased by the guards because of it. So yeah, as much as I hate certain parts of the game, I still recommend it. Just know what you're getting into. And here's hoping each future game gets better and better.Also, the game seems to run like crap on DX10 (when there are more then 10 people in a crowd, the FPS drop like bombs). I had to open the Local Game Files (or whatever Steam calls it) to launch the DX9 version which runs a million times better (also why Steam only shows me having played the game for about 1 1/2 hours). And it's not because my PC can't handle the max graphics or anything. It's in the software. I can run BF4 on High-Ultra settings with my current setup.			"

At least I found the game quite frustrating, and it was a relief, when you see that future AC games just keep upgrading. It's a short game, but to understand the story in future games, you should really play it! So it's recommended if you're new to the series, so when playing later games you can see how the game progresses!			"

The background in the game disappears transparent than only ladders and pillars or floor stones remain visible everything else is transparent drives me nuts, right click then left click on delete local content equals waste of money not to mention that there's no such thing as a Crouch key or Sprinting,  And OK so they want me to hold down my right mouse button, then hold down the letter "" S "" so that I can sprint and then touched the space bar to jump.. then press the A to interact to slash locking mechanism, just for a thought maybe this game should not be for PC use a consul OMFG...The game has been specifically ported to PC from consul.

In this game you get to follow Altair, who lived during the Crusades of the late 12th century.

The graphics on this game is probably the best in the series, the missions are challenging and the way you synch with your ancestor is interesting as well.On the down side, the combat system isn't very good, and along with the depressing free-running and the ability to NOT swim, it's tipped on both scales to say weather or not this is a good game.

From what I can remember, I enjoyed it. Sorry for not being able to give more details.I will say one thing though: the minimap is rubbish. It doesn't show the outline of any buildings so you can't use it for navigation at all, unlike the second game's minimap. From what I can recall, the minimap is basically a circle with cardinal directions wirrten on it with a opqaue background inside that contains a load of markers for quests and whatnot that the minimap if of no use in getting to.

												Great game. Great way to open up a completely new series. The game looks good for its time, free running plays fluidly, and the story is very good. One complaint that most people seem to share, although this wasnt an issue for me, was that the missions became too repetitive. I can see how people found that to be the case but if you stick to doing the bare minimum required to move on, you literally cut the busy work in half and shorten the games lifespan to the perfect length. The combat is very easy and its almost impossible to die from combat once you learn how to counter attack but that doesnt take away from the games experience because you still end up running and sneaking from guards for the sake of saving time. The long horse rides from city to city can be a bit of a pain and the games ending is a TERRIBLE cliffhanger that leaves much to be desired but by the time youre reading this, AC2 is already out anyways so what does it matter? This game is a great buy and its a MUST play.			"

												Assassin's Creed is one of those games that goes out of its way to make you feel badass. For example, when running along rooftops, so long as you're within step or reach of something to jump on, run across, or grab onto (depending on your skills obtained), Altair is going to look badass as hell running around and stabbing people.The game is not super difficult, but it's fun to play an assassin.

												There is no doubt that the first of the AC games is an unpolished gem. The repetitive side-missions, journeying around, and over-alert guards are pretty annoying, but the story (the Assassin stuff in the Holy Land, not the futuristic pseudo-science ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t) is pretty good and the actual assassinations are rather fun. It's just everything else is kinda... bleh. I started the series with AC2 and that was alright, though this being the start of the story makes it a natural place to start playing these games. The  sequels vastly improve the gameplay though, so keep that in mind if you plan to check out the entire series, start with this, and get irritated at all the little stuff that gets in the way of making this a great game. Overall, this gets a recommendation from me... barely. And only because it is a stepping stone to the much better sequels.			"

												It's a pretty good game and it introduces some neat mechanics, but it's very unpolished. Considering that the game ends with a “to be continued”, you should play it if you're interested in the franchise as a whole, but I'm not sure how strongly I'd recommend it by itself. It's a great launching point for a franchise and does some cool new things but it does have its flaws.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2011/08/post-launch-reviews-5-assassins-creed.html "

												I played this a long time ago on the 360 but could never really finish it due to varying reasons. But seeing as all the Assassin Creed games are on sale I went ahead and got all of them for a pretty decent price of $5 a piece, which isn’t bad for such a big series. Replaying through the game the story isn’t half bad, and am looking forward to reviewing the other Assassins Creed games in time.One big negative thing is the way climbing works.  It isn’t horrible, but there are times where you would want to climb up a building fast rather than jump off a building killing yourself in the process.  Other than that, this was a big hit in the series and is a great story, providing you are more of a story driven person. 8/10 "

												The original AC was more of a tech demo than a proper game, but still has some good aspects that some people might desire. +The environments are lovely, if a bit whitewashed, and the game runs buttery smooth 60FPS max settings even on my 6-year old hardware.+Combat is MUCH harder than in the sequels; if you get cornered with 4+ guards surrounding you, you're screwed. Counterkills still exist, but the chain kills introduced in Brotherhood are not, which I like.+This game is much more stealth-oriented than the sequels. If you alert your target, not only are they difficult to kill in a straight fight, you will very quickly get surrounded by guards and have your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you.+You are encouraged to obtain useful information about your target and ways you can take them out, whether it's a map of patrol routes or a hiding place to jump out from. These are obtained by completing side missions (see below for why this is a bad thing).There are quite a few problems with this game though:-Doesn't play nice with controllers; every time you turn on the game it defaults to KB/M, so you have to go into the options menu to switch to controller every time.-Unnecessarily convoluted game exiting. To leave you have to exit the animus, then quit. Took me too long to figure that out.-Combat can sometimes be slow to respond which, considering how lethal fighting is and the fact that you don't have medicine to heal mid-combat, can be a death sentence.-NO FAST CLIMBING. The godsend of AC2 over the original was being able to climb nonstop hand over hand. With AC 1, you will stop at every move, then move to the next area. Makes traversing areas painfully slow if you've played any of the other games which feature this faster climbing.-Altair's voice is plainly American, while everyone else in the Animus has period appropriate accents. Very immersion-breaking.-Guards sometimes detect and attack you for no apparent reason, so it's best to avoid any areas with guards entirely, or try to blend through them. This doesn't always work for some reason though.-Very little story. Go kill these guys, then something happens at the end that sets up for AC2 (significantly better).-PLEASE SIR, CAN YOU SPARE ANY MONEYY!?!?Overall, if you really want to experience the series from the beginning, it does have some nice aspects, but if you've already played the others it will be very hard to go back and deal with the archaic combat and freeclimbing systems.

I would definitely recommend it to people who are HUGE fans of stealth, history and Assassins. However the game is very repetitive, and it has very boring sections where you see interactions with characters you simply do not care about. And that is why, on top of the very automated freerunning, I cannot recommend this game to anyone but the previously mentioned people. Try at your own risk.			"

												This game marked the start of an excellent new intellectual property in a era when originality in the entertainment industry is sorely lacking. These days it seems two out of three movies coming out are either sequels or remakes. I'd avoided spoilers before playing it so I was completely unprepared for the entire Desmond half of the story. The gameplay fulfilled my expectations but the story was so much more than what I had expected. From the trailers I'd seen I thought this would be a game in which I played an assassin taking out some Templar knights organization. But the whole Apple of Eden and the Animus? Didn't see any of that coming.My biggest gripe is that 100% completion (synchronization) doesn't unlock any extras of any kind, and I'm not talking about an Achievement. I had hoped some kind of movie, or maybe some answered would unlock but really you don't get anything at all.My second gripe is that this game is really simple/easy. The gameplay is basically a vehicle for the story. There's really nothing wrong with that, per se, but each ""chapter/target"" of the game plays out identical to the last so it can get repetitive. And as for easyness? There was one time, just one time, in the entire game where I got ""stuck"". It was when i was trying to get the flag on the tallest building in the game, I don't remember which city. As I made the climb I got stuck midway, I couldn't spot a suitable handhold. Just before I started to backtrack I literally thought to myself, ""This game is really easy. There's no way I'd come this far up and have to backtrack for any reason."" I hit the keys to make a jump across a gap onto a wall that didn't look like it had any handholds and, lo!, Altair made the jump and grabbed the wall.			"

												When I was first introduced to the Assassin's Creed franchise, I played AC2 and never actually bothered to play the game that started it all until now primarily becuase I feared it would have been very boring and simple as there are countless things that were in AC2 but not AC1 such as buying equipment. However, once I started to play this game my opinion shifted and I realised why his franchise became huge. The graphics were far ahead for its time as it was released in 2007 and even though there are an occaional glitch or two, they aren't majour-they are quite trivial and don't affect the gameplay. The story is a very good one as it focuses on a an assassin regaining his lost honour and title by assinating 9 templars and in doing so reveals much about corruption and deception. The character admitadly we don't see much of a development on as he is quite bland-I prefer Ezio overall as we see his development and maturity more- however, he adds a sense of ""coldness"" which i believe makes him more of an assassin. Even though I had feared that there would be a lot missing and would make the game simple compared to it's sequels, there were things that did make it much harder such as not being able to have a killstreak, calling other assassins, having air/ledge/hiding spot assination-which I think was the most difficult part or having a double blade which made the game more of achallenge and makes it more fun. Overall, if you are looking to see what began it all, don't mind how many things are missing from it since AC2 was a huge leap from AC1 and want more of an Assassin game where the objective is to assassinate multiple targts as the main plot then this game then this game is for you and you should get it since it is quite cheap!I would rate this game 8.5/10 for being a brilliant start to an awesome franchise!

												The phrase ""is this a glitch or a feature"" comes to mind often. Still fun when it isn't glitching out but it can get controller throwing irritating very fast and don't even get me started on trying to just EXIT THE GAME. I don't even try anymore; I just save and then close it via Taskmanager. I reccomened it when it's on sale for 5 bucks or less but don't waste full price on it.			"

												This game is pretty amazing. Even though its about 6 years old now, you would never think so from the graphics. You really feel like you're an assassin in every sense of the word. The missions can get difficult at times but they are few and far between. The story itself is interesting to a point as well. The cities are beautifully done and you can tell untold hours of historical research went into this game.  The voice acting is very good. The random uses of real Arabic and German (among others?) was a welcomed surprise and made the game feel very authentic to the time and place.The only gripes I would have with the game are 2 things; one more important than the other. 1. The way to exit the game without using Alt+F4 takes forever and is really unneccesarily annoying (More important one).2. Sometimes the camera can get really stuck at weird angles but with a little mouse and keyboard work, its very negligable. This game is definently worth every penny.			"

												TLDR: Great story and medieval atmosphere, best style of graphics, missions are repeating and boring.Here it beggan. Very first instalment in famous series. But question is: can it be still interesting after those years and the hoard of newer ""brothers"". Sumprisingly it can. 2 stories are combined - each depicting battle between templars and assassins. Of course, only very little is said about present (future) story of Desmond and his story is more developed in other games. Main is Altair story - full of autentic medieval atmosphere. That is for me main reason playing this game. Even graphics are somhow rough (better then ACII ""fairy tale"" graphics), making it somehow realistic. Biggest downfall of this game is of course stereotype ... missions are except killer contracts really same and you will lost interest whyile doing third time that same thing again. Chasing, climbing, running, protecting, ... It will get boring. To summarize: AC is great game for all medieval lovers and people who are interested in all aspects of AC story. But expect to be given often stereotype and boring missions.			"

												9.6/10 This game is a masterpiece.This story is very fun even with the robotic emotions of Altair. But for an 2008 game it is fantastic and still holds as one of the better games out even in 2014. The graphics are amazing, the combat is fun and skillful, but the kill then run then hide gets very repetive and tiring. The reason this didn't get 10/10 is because of the repetiveness and because how quickly Altair changed. He became a badass, listen to no one guy to an Enlightened, I understand why my actions are wrong kind of guy in almost a blink of an eye.			"

												Feels like half a product. Running, climbing, and jumping through the towns are very fun and feel good. But they forgot to build a game on top of that mechanic. All of the rest feels kind of half done. Whoops. Graphics still hold up well years later, but aside from this and the running mechanic, there isn't much there. If you're easily amused despite dullness and repetition, there's definitely something here. Lots of physical territory to cover and the large amount of city geography is interesting until you realize how similar every location looks. Most of you should probably move along.			"

												The one that started all this Assassin Creed madness. Bad things first: side quests get repetitive and boring very soon, there is no variability there and it might actually make you think: that s all there is to it? But the overall story is decent, especially missions with killing your 9 targets are always different in interesting new places to look for assassination techniques. Plus the 3 big cities, Damascus, Jerusalem and Acre are nice fresh air to New York (in which 90% games are situated). Historical period of crusades is really something that is not seen so often.			"

												The Good: Amazing story, beautifully created visually and technically, lots of different missions to complete, parkour and crowd system are unique and revolutionary, DirectX 10 looks greatThe Bad: Some control and clipping issues, extremely repetitive missions, not very diverse visually, crowd simulation gets predictable and repetitiveNothing is true. Everything is permitted. This is a saying heard throughout Assassin's Creed and it really sticks with you. So does the thick plot that has come to take the game industry by storm as well as one of the greatest game characters of all time: Altair. The plot is actually weird at first because it's a sci-fi story. You are actually Desmond Miles capture by modern world Templars. They stick you in an Animus and use your DNA to access your ancestors memories to find the Piece of Eden which can be used to control people's minds. That one ancestor is Altair set during the crusades. The second story is of Altair who ends up losing his rank and status among the Assassin Brotherhood by failing a mission due to eagerness and stupidity. Your master, Al Mualim, sends on special missions to assassinate key leaders throughout the holy land (Acre, Jerusalem, and Damascus) to keep them from taking the Piece of Eden and using it to win the war.As you can see the plot is very interesting with a lot of twists. How is the game though? You have a huge open world that are full of side missions and hundreds of buildings to climb. Assassin's Creed has a parkour climbing system as well as a puppeteering system. You control each of Altair's limbs in two different states. The ""socially acceptable"" state allows you to use eagle vision which can show enemies and key targets. You can gently push people away from you and this is key because is you're running around the city knocking people over the guards will come after you, and towards the end of the game everyone is highly suspicious of you and just a few people knocked over will have the entire guard on your tail. The third thing is obviously combat, but if you hold down the run button you start climbing buildings, grabbing people to toss them, and jumping around.Assassin's Creed really tried to introduce crowd psychology into the game and it works here, but does feel limited. If you climb buildings people will react by stopping and staring and saying things accordingly. If you use ladders people don't mind so much. While using rooftops is faster and keeps you away from most guards you must watch out for guards on rooftops who will shoot you with arrows if you don't get down, kill them, or move away quickly. The climbing works well enough, but there are some controls issues, clipping issues, and other issues with the camera. When Altair is facing a different way then the camera he will jump towards his way instead of the way you're telling him too. Also, if you run around a pole or near a crate he'll start climbing it instead of just jumping over or going around. This can get down right frustrating when you are running away from a dozen guards and trying to find a hiding spot.The game also introduces anonymity via a symbol near your health bar which stays white when no ones suspects you, but will turn yellow when you are watched and flash red when guards are on to you. When it does this get away quickly or kill whomever is watching you. Don't just kill out in the open or people will run around screaming and call guards. Get away from dead bodies quickly because guards will come by and try to find who killed them or citizens will give you away. If you are caught you need to kill all guards after you or hide. To do this you must break their line of sight and the symbol will flash yellow. When it does find a hiding spot quickly before it turns red again. You can hide on benches between people, stacks of hay, in groups of monks praying, or draped boxes on rooftops. Stay there for a few seconds and you will by anonymous again. You can avoid all this chaos by just jogging, staying calm, don't flail around and jump around like a monkey in crowded areas etc.This whole crowd system is really something else and works well, but feels repetitive and predictable because of the recycled sayings, animations, and it always happens the same way. The combat is the same way because while you can gain new abilities it feels like a counter fest. You can attack with a sword or short sword, throw daggers, but most guards always block and you just stand there with the block button held down and wait for someone to attack and then counter which is usually an instant kill. This gets repetitive and the combat isn't as deep as it could be since combos are limited, and animations are repeated often. It does control well and feels smooth so I guess that's better than broken.The most repetitive thing, and the game's biggest flaw, are the constantly repeated missions that repeat dozens and dozens of times. You can save citizens, do some time trial flag gathering missions, escort missions, assassination missions (probably the most fun), interrogation, eavesdropping, pickpocketing, and climbing tall buildings to find view points to put more missions on your map in that area. Sure they are fun at first, but after you have saved the 30th citizen, or climbed the 50th building it gets old and you just want it to end. Some more mission diversity would have been nice.While its cool to be an assassin, sneaking up behind a guard and shoving a punch dagger in his gut, and then running away while he falls to the ground without anyone suspecting otherwise is satisfying you must look good doing it too. Assassin's Creed looks amazing, even today, and the PC version sports DirectX 10 graphics with some slightly higher resolution textures. The game looks a lot better than console versions and is well worth another play through just for that alone. While the graphics are amazing technically, artistically the game feels very Middle Eastern with a great soundtrack to support that, voice acting, and the whole game feels true to its time. The architecture is great, the clothing, lifestyles, and jobs people do in the game, but it all does kind of look the same with a lot of greys, browns, and whites.Overall Assassin's Creed is an amazing experience with a story you will talk about long after you finish the game, great crowd simulation, and the true feeling of being an assassin. If there was some more mission diversity, visual diversity, and smoother controls the game would be perfect. This is a game you can not miss and every gaming fan should play this.~Score: 8.5/10			"

												This game marked the start of an excellent new intellectual property in a era when originality in the entertainment industry is sorely lacking. These days it seems two out of three movies coming out are either sequels or remakes. I'd avoided spoilers before playing it so I was completely unprepared for the entire Desmond half of the story. The gameplay fulfilled my expectations but the story was so much more than what I had expected. From the trailers I'd seen I thought this would be a game in which I played an assassin taking out some Templar knights organization. But the whole Apple of Eden and the Animus? Didn't see any of that coming.My biggest gripe is that 100% completion (synchronization) doesn't unlock any extras of any kind, and I'm not talking about an Achievement. I had hoped some kind of movie, or maybe some answered would unlock but really you don't get anything at all.My second gripe is that this game is really simple/easy. The gameplay is basically a vehicle for the story. There's really nothing wrong with that, per se, but each ""chapter/target"" of the game plays out identical to the last so it can get repetitive. And as for easyness? There was one time, just one time, in the entire game where I got ""stuck"". It was when i was trying to get the flag on the tallest building in the game, I don't remember which city. As I made the climb I got stuck midway, I couldn't spot a suitable handhold. Just before I started to backtrack I literally thought to myself, ""This game is really easy. There's no way I'd come this far up and have to backtrack for any reason."" I hit the keys to make a jump across a gap onto a wall that didn't look like it had any handholds and, lo!, Altair made the jump and grabbed the wall.			"

I'm really upset now at having to play the same scenario over and over again. I'll probably just give it up and remove the game from my library. You might not have these issues, but if you start noticing weird things, or get game crashes, you soon will tire of this, as I have.			"

												You can definitely tell that this is the original, but don't let that stop you from buying it. The controls at first seem very unwieldly, but after an hour of play, they become second nature and allow one to do numerous actions at once which you couldn't do otherwise. The storyline's nice and it keeps you asking why. I will forewarn you that they do screw with Christianity and religion in general, but as the Assassin's Creed is ""Nothing is true. Everything is permitted"", it calls for wisdom in discerning between what is and what isn't. Assassin's Creed asks us to question what really happened and to defend our answer, while still taking on the guise as a game. Also, assassinating people that have no idea their life is going to end is just kind of fun, in a sort of morbid way.			"

												I had decided over the summer that I would start playing the AC games, so like usual I went to the first game, then I could at least get a feel for what the other games may be like. Though this game is very different from the other ones, I found it to be a fun start. If you have ever played any of the other AC games, I recommend not playing this one. I thought it was a good starting game though for the franchise.			"

												This was rough. It wasn't hard, but the controls make this type of game more difficult than it needs to be. Terrible combat makes any fight something to run from, but when the last hour and a half is made up of mob battles, I just wanted it to end. The free running is fun at first, but it's to grabby to be great. Also, there are no skippable cutscenes. So even if you cared about the story (I did not), if you fail a mission, be prepared to rewatch it over and over again.This games got so annoying in the end, I'm not sure if I'll ever pick up the second titles, even though I hear it's a better game. Better than Assassin's Creed? Not hard and maybe not for me.			"

												Played it and finish it here's my thoughts:GoodVisuals, looks pretty good, environments are quite expansive and quite immersiveOKGameplay, its not bad but can be extremely frustrating.  I'm thinking this made to be played with a gamepad rather than mouse and keyboard.  Can get stuck with character doing everything other than what you want him to, but is also at times quite intuitive and it's not really a controller skills game (like Tomb raider used to be).The missions tend to be quite repetitive, each target has a set of optional sub-missions to do first, well all those sub-missions are the same.As the player it's your job to complete the mission in between the stories, it's not a RPGStory is ok, (No spoilers) some of the key elements I thought were quite apparent right from the start,Not goodNot being able to skip scenes, Lots of slow bits, Saving is weird, not sure how it worked but you can’t save where you want as far as i know and considering you can’t skip scenes it makes it all a bit painful.I'd give game  3/5, just a bit slow, character development a bit week but nice scenery  pretty cool jumping the roof tops of old Jerusalem  "

												This game can get a bit repetitive and linear at times, but it still proved to be a lot of fun. I got to kill people, and then upgrade my ability to kill people. The story line was good as it brought about more killing, and the graphics were good, especially the ones where you got to be murder-y. This probably sounds like the rant of a psychopath... But it's still a fun game. I liked Altair more than Ezio, which is probably the minority opinion. For the start of the series this worked pretty gosh darn well, the health mechanics as it related to the storyline was one of the more inspired ideas. Buy it, kill some gaurds and templars, throw some knives and nap in some bureaus.			"

												The first of the Assassin's Creed series happens to be my favorite (I haven't played all the Assassin's Creed so my review may change later.) Why is it my favorite? The gameplay is outstanding as is the story. You begin as a high ranking assassin name Altaïr. You and two other assassin's are looking for the ""apple"" in a cave along the way you break the three simple rules that defines the creed, I won't go too much into the details. Once you get back to your master you are get underattacked by the templars, the Brotherhood's enemies. After you scare off the templars you get hold on trail for breaking the three simple rules of the Creed. You get stabbed in the body and left to die, or you thought. You are reborn and as a noivce so you must work your way up the rankings once again. That's the simple starting of the game. The second best part about this game is that you don't need Uplay to play it. Now remember ""Nothing is true and everything is permitted.""			"

												Assassin's Creed 1 is definitely a great game. If you do have some time to play, try playing it first through Black Flag, you certainly will understand a whole lot of things. For me, it's a great game, and you could totally see how much the game has changed over the years. a/ The story plot: is nice, the way the game alternates and lets you pause between the Memory Blocks (which is pieces of the story of Altair), is great. b/ The combat: is simple, but effective. It was a little bit too boring at first, but once you get the ability to Counter Kill, things start getting much better. But you will have to be patient til' that part, believe me. c/ The missions: are nice, but to be honest, as mentioned by a lot of articles and reviews, they are repetitive in general. Every city you enter, you will have to go check out every viewpoint, rescue every cititzen in ""harassing"" trouble, do some interrogation, meeting your Hashassin guild mates to do some jobs for them, eavesdropping people talking, pickpocketing; you will even have to do some ""Flag finding running"" too. Doing all that and you'll be able to access the ""Assassinating your target"" part. d/ The stealth gameplay: is nice, but since this is the first game, compared to the sequels, you won't feel much of the stealth mechanism, most of the time you will have to do some combat, against 7-8 guys all at the same time (you will start noticing this after getting that Counter Kill ability).e/ One of the things I like about this game, is the fact that it doesn't require you to collect all additional ""flags"" to unlock the ending. Not at all, so don't you worry, just enjoy your game, do as much as you can. The side quests will be repetitively boring, but even the conversations with each of the Hashassin guild mate are different!, so you can enjoy a little bit of their stories and their information on your targets. And that's good! f/ The cities: are well-designed; gotta say I'm pretty impressed with the way Ubisoft has designed them; From the ledges for you to climb, to the positioning and distributions of Hiding places, I've gotta say no wonder the first AC game was a success! You've gotta play the series from the first game through the last to see how the series has changed over the years!If you have played Prince of Persia before, you will definitely see some common things between the two games, some buildings sure can remind you of some obstacles in POP series CONCLUSION: 9.5/10 when you take into account this is the game made in 10 years ago. Definitely a worthy game to play if you want to have a nice Assassin's Creed collection.			"

												Late review:7/10Besides the repetitive story and missions, the first Assassin's Creed is true to its story, you're playing as an Assassin after all during the year 1191? I forgot.. Theres no happy moments no friends to hang out with, Altair was a born and breed Assassin soon to be Master, your mission is to kill 12 targets your master has given you to redeem yourself.Its simple:- Gather intel- Plan- Assassinate your target- Get in.. Get outAssassins Creed 1 is True to its objective, theres a brotherhood and a Master something the rest of the sequels fail to understand. It's not an adventure game where the main protagainst goes on adventures its about the life of an Assassin.The real reason why Assassin's Creed game story fails everytime is because of the ""Animus"", the game is nothing without the animus of course, but you don't get to see how the character lives you're constantly skipping through time, You don't know what your favourite Assasins food is? what his favoruite colour is? what his favourite weapon to use throwing knives? Sword? their opinion of the hidden blade.Ubisoft releases a book of their game with more in-depth story and details, why can't they make the story of the book into their games...			"

												This is my favorite of the series I think because of the time it takes place. And its in an area of the world I have always wanted to visit. This game as are the sequels, very detailed and gorgeous graphically. The Story is something that other developers could take a few lessons from in its consistency and scope while maintaining a huge level of open ended game play. Take the time to sit back and become a master swordsman as you travel from city to city. You will become so good that you will never be touched by a sword again regardless of the number of  foes (timing is everything). Buy this game at any price but it is a steal when on sale.			"

												Have only heard others rave about this game and decided to get it during the steam sale.  It plays fine, the cities are a little redundent and the controls can be frustrating, but it's an older game so it's fine.  The issue I've been having is that it crashes every few hours, and after googling it this seems to be a common problem on newer PCs with win 8.  While normally I'd be okay with a slightly buggy game, when it crashes the game tends to set me back to the beginning of the memory block.  This is very frustrating because after getting through half of memory block 4, it crashed and sent me back to the first city.  I don't know if I want to finish the game now, only because the crashing tends to wipe my save.  So overall, a decent game, but it just doesn't work on my system very well.			"

												Even after so much time and playing the other AC games, I decided to go back to the root of the Desmond Story Arc. In terms of story it has a great setup leading into the next game dealing with Ezio. Altiar's story was a little short but his was not meant to be but a window. His story plays a greater part latr in the series but I'm getting ahead of myself. Remembering the controls was easy, though it seems easier on a controler (properly  bound) However the controler made the camera slow to utalize, unless I over looked a sensitivity option somewhere. The game had a lot of glitches in it from jumping against a ledge that you would normally catch only to miss follwed by NPC's glitching in their movements durring and after a chase. not to mention the occasional crash. I could have done with a little more story but that my personal preference.Story: 4.5Graphics: 5Controls: 3.5Stability: 3			"

												This game does not work on modern PCs.  the only option that worked for me was to run the game in DirectX 9 mode.  Luckily that .exe is offered.  And you cannot launch it from steam without renaming the DirectX9 version to the one that Steam wants to load.  I do not feel the developers should be held responsible for updating their games until the end of time, but Steam should at least display a warning.Altair's voice is some of the worst voice acting I have ever heard to date in all the games I've ever played.  It's painful to listen to.  Most other voices are just ok.  I turn music off so no comment there.  The beggars, guards, and other people are numerous but their voices aren't numerous enough, so you'll hear the same recordings over and over again, though each map has different voices for the same types of people.The controls are a little awkward, and i'm not referring to the difficulty matching up each action to a button.  It actually plays pretty well once you understand the High Profile mode which some people have difficulty adjusting to.  The awkwardness is with the camera angles.  They get stuck a lot in tight places, where you will often find yourself in, and it causes you to stab innocent people or jump off a ledge when you don't intend to.I was hoping the fluidness and abilities would match that of the batman series, but it doesn't at all.  You can't aim the angle in which to throw a person off a ledge, forcing you to line your character up correctly, which may not be possible the way the guards move or other objects that may be in the way.  You can't pounce from a ledge to kill despite the opening sequence alluding that you can.  (You also cannot hide amidst the schollars while being watched as alluded to in the opening sequence as well.)  Hiding only works when you're not watched, which I feel is more real anyway.  You can't extend your hidden blade while swordfighting.  The knife throw and knife slash is the same button, so if they dodge your attack and land too far away, you'll reduce your inventory of throwing knives if you keep smashing the button.  You can pickpocket for more though.  Your character is a bit limited in what it can do.Despite its age, the game holds up pretty well.  the pixellation is apparent in the scenes but the models are full and detailed.  the maps are maze-like and feel like a corridor may or may not be present while running around, and if you run down a dark alley, you may have a 50/50 chance you'll hit a wall and have to fight the people you're facing.  there is plenty of z-axis also.  You'll feel like the maps are quite full.  There is duplication of architecture but it isn't noticeable that much.  the horse riding is also pretty cool and you can fight while riding, though its a little hard to hit anything.  They can knock you off your horse.the guard's senses are better than the Hitman games.  Hitman's character's ability to detect you is good, but this game feels more real.  You can fist fight in front of guards without them caring, so you can get away from the drunks.I got it on sale and its about a fair price then.  Buy it to partake in the storyline or learn the controls and it will help you later in the series.  It's still a good game.			"

												A Flawed Dose of NostalgiaIn 2016, it seemed like to play the original 2007 Assassin's Creed was to revert to the rough draft of the AC formula, but that is where I found myself loving the core gameplay of AC. The first game in the franchise hadn't yet been bogged down with the extra bloat most evident in the later titles like AC Unity, from the challenges and side missions to the rendering of visuals. The seminal Assassin's Creed succeeds today in 2016 because it benefits from being the innovative first in a formulated franchise.The balance between a solid storyline and mindless side activities kept me moving towards finishing the game without feeling like the completionist challenge was unsurmountable (a personal problem I find with modern open-world games). I typically started with viewpoints, moved to ""Save Citizens"" missions, and then began my formal investigation into my assassination target. In my mind, I was learning the city, its people, and then solving the overall problem plaguing them. The objectives could be completed in any manner, but the approach I took felt the most natural for a stranger entering a city.The combat felt great when my timing synced up well,  It felt good to be that overpowered, yet it was too easy and didn't involve much strategy despite being trained in-game with various techniques. Occasionally, I would find myself on-top of various things like market stalls with six other men on the same stall with three other men attempting to climb up to the ""battlefield"" . The AI scripting felt like the enemies were simply and mindlessly piling on. All I had to do was time the counter attack successfully to take out any force.The stealth felt unrefined and was frequently undermined by a stray AI stepping into the shared environment or a drunken NPC shoving me into a group while I was attempting to blend in. While it helped to utilize stealth from time to time, the behaviors which broke my stealth usually threw me into another fifteen man battle. It was most useful when traversing the map to avoid battle engagement, but detrimental to all the investigations crafted into the story when a major assassination would down spiral due to imprecise stealth mechanics. This is best illustrated when I attempted to throw a knife at my target and pressed the lock-on button. It alerted everyone in the arena to my presence with the simple lock-on and a twenty man battle ensued. After bouncing around to various AC games in the past year or so, the GUI in this original game felt so in touch with the premise of the Animus technology. The HUD and in-game menu never appeared gaudy or clunky, but the main menu unnecessarily required me to briefly switch to my mouse to make a character profile selection before I could begin playing with my gamepad. The map was a delight to engage with, but the investigations give the player various map information such as where guards are during the assassination's preceding event and the safest path for extraction after killing the target, that was ultimately undermined by an under-detailed HUD map.I played the original version of Assassin's Creed to completion on PS3 around 2009 and it left a nostalgic feeling in the back of my mind. The nostalgic thirst was quenched with this latest 2016 playthrough on PC, but not without some stumbles along the way that reminded me that some serious gameplay mechanic overhaul occurred in the past 7 years. This game innovated at the time, but was refined greatly with the sequel.			"

Warning though it is repititve along the lines of games like Shadow of Morder You basically do the same side quests again and again in 3 different cities and then go after your target which advances you to the next part of the story.   Was probably ahead of its time considering this game is like 8 years old.  The graphics are still very good even by today's standards.

												Stupid game. Bore action, repetable and awful fight mechanics. Maybe, at the year it apeared, few got excited, but now, after you play some real open world games, you realize that Assassins Creed I its a game with a lot of issues. I have waste 20 hours of my life with this canadian crap. The move mechanics of Altair, the hero of the game, are still an enigma for me. There were moments in game when soldiers were trying to catch me and the hero just stoped near a wall. The reaction time of the hero is poor - after you take one or two hits, he finally reacts. You have to discover missions (witch are the same) after climbing some tall buildings - whats the point of climbing in the game? Its a game for xbox or ps, and playing it at pc was not confortable at all for me.  Maybe, the other parts of the game are better, but the first one was far away from my expectations based on the good critics of the game. And I have to say that the killing Robert De ... mision was impossible for me. Onestly, I like a game where you got the fighting moves in short time. It is not the case here. The fight moves of this game are extremly complex (I bet even the ones that create this game, cant win some fights) and you have to alternate them quickly. Conclusion: I would abandoned the game from its begining, but I payed for it and I stubbered to play. Big mistake!!			"

												If like me you was looking for an insight into AC don't start with this one, The game play is repetitive,to the point you feel like its ground hog day in every mission you do, (climb to the top of a tower look around jump off) - after the 5th time of doing this I was looking for a key to stop the cut sceen no joy.(Free a peasant lady or scholar from guards) - again another cut screen of sorts the npc's says the same thing Time after Time after time. and nothing you can do will reduce the amount of time it takes for the NPC to say what there going to say and move on.Even the 6 missions in each memory block are all the same - eves drop on a NPC / Kill someone with information / kill some guards who are after someone with information / Run from A to B to get more information / Collect some flags for more information. And then go kill the guy you have been sent to kill.Movement in game - Really annoying hold right mouse button and space - Thats it nothing more, off your toon goes runs up walls jumps over gaps hops between structures, move the mose left and right for direction.Combat - I have pretty much only needed 3 moves all the way thro grab and push - Counter attack - and stealth kill. I didn't find a need for throwing stars or the short blade on your back. No need for a combo at all.Like I said at the start if your looking for an intro into the AC games don't pick this 1 as its put me off the whole lot.			"

												It's extremely repetive even at a very early stage. It's not that bad a game, it's just boring a lot of the time. Its very mediocre in many ways, placing itself in-between in most ways. The fights, for example, are a bit like hack and slash and most can be won just by hitting the same button again and again. Yet, you will still need to think a bit over how to approach the figth to win them when there are for example several enemies, just not enough to make it a tactical or skill-needing figthing game. So it's neither real hack and slash, nor gives you the freedom to make advanced moves, it's just a bit anoying in-between. In the same way, an assassination game should have some element of sneak, acrobatic skill or tactic approach, but most of the time, you will find it boring to slowly walk through until finaly you just ram through and find out that you could just have done that from the beginning, again it places itself in an annoying in-between. While you carry out a lot acrobatic stunts, ""you"" don't really do anything. Unlike older platforms games, the game does most of the things for you. Unlike an old platform classic like Super Mario 64 or Tomb Raider, you don't need to practice your skills and calculate how far to jump, find out just how much to pull the controller to get over the small bridge without falling down or anything like that. The game will make sure you don't fall down and almost always make the jump, and even if you don't, it doesn't really matter. Assassins Creed is a good example of how much many modern games hold your hand, leaving out all the fun of having to focus and using all your skills to win. Its repetitive and drags simple things out instead of giving real challenges. There are so many better games out there for you to use your money and time on.			"

Each time a bit more salt is thrown in to the hash.If one could skip all the fillers and focus on the story, it would be a nice 2h interactive movie.I would recommend this game if you could somehow remove the ""filler"" content and just ""watch"" this interactive movie while taking control during main target assassinations.

												The first of the Assassin's Creed series happens to be my favorite (I haven't played all the Assassin's Creed so my review may change later.) Why is it my favorite? The gameplay is outstanding as is the story. You begin as a high ranking assassin name Altaïr. You and two other assassin's are looking for the ""apple"" in a cave along the way you break the three simple rules that defines the creed, I won't go too much into the details. Once you get back to your master you are get underattacked by the templars, the Brotherhood's enemies. After you scare off the templars you get hold on trail for breaking the three simple rules of the Creed. You get stabbed in the body and left to die, or you thought. You are reborn and as a noivce so you must work your way up the rankings once again. That's the simple starting of the game. The second best part about this game is that you don't need Uplay to play it. Now remember ""Nothing is true and everything is permitted.""			"

												If this is the first and only Assassin's creed game you've played, please don't judge the entire saga based on this game--in my opinion this is the worst one in the entire series; the game play is very repetitive.  To be fair, this was the first game that needed to be set to launch the entire saga.  The game had some very creative concepts like jumping off 30 story buildings, secretively assassinating with a hidden blade.  The story line is pretty cool too, I won't spoil too much but it has a matrix like story-line.  Overall it's a very good play and a must if you like platforming and sneakily killing people type games.  It is also a must play first if you intend on getting into the assassin's creed story lines.			"

												The one that started all this Assassin Creed madness. Bad things first: side quests get repetitive and boring very soon, there is no variability there and it might actually make you think: that s all there is to it? But the overall story is decent, especially missions with killing your 9 targets are always different in interesting new places to look for assassination techniques. Plus the 3 big cities, Damascus, Jerusalem and Acre are nice fresh air to New York (in which 90% games are situated). Historical period of crusades is really something that is not seen so often.			"

That's the whole game, sadly.But like I said earlier - the story is great and you really need to play this game in order to play the others thats why I give it a thumbs up!			"

												Here are my notes while playing the game if you don't have time to read them DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY! IT'S NOT WORTH IT. Pro's- Premise of the story has a lot of potential- Very easy to run. GPU usage is 20-30% (GTX 970), CPU usage is 10% (i7 3820)- Running and climbing is a good idea let down by poor implementationNegatives- tutorial is buggy and repetitious- intro was intriguing yet boring at the same time. Go figure!- buggy fighting mechanics- it was very hard to control your character- game has a lot of hand holding- confusing messages in the UI- mission consists of 1. Travel for ten minutes to city 2. Gather information twice 3. Plan attack 4. Attack never goes as planned- the fact that you have time to interrogate the target before he dies means it must be a stealth kill for privacy but never happens- alerts only go off when in hiding places even if you have not been found for 10 mins- story is Altiar is arrogant and foolish, gets demoted despite still being sent on missions to kill key targets. Assassinations are clumsy but they are planned that way for story, if this is true there is no need of planning attacks if it always boils down to a fight. - Desmond parts could at least let you run making exploration less time consuming and annoying.- the introduction from every assassination is boring and long- story gets interesting midway but the bad mechanics still hinder experience- menu won't start with controller activated- you can't swim FFS- BUG! I attempt a mission to kill kill 3 soldiers, I killed two out of 3 failing the mission but when restarting mission dead bodies are still on floor alerting guards to my presence. Pathetic!- these NPCs that are deranged pushing you every time you walk past are annoying and unnecessary- boss fights are really bad. Chase till he stops then fight 20 guys, keep hitting boss till your player assassinates him automatically.			"

												Looking at this game at first I thought it was a normal Hitman assasin type game. I bought it with a bundle so I thought I would give it a try. It has a really great storyline and is more sci fi than I thought, in fact it revolves around a sci fi type theme.If you get a chance play it			"

												This game starts off with a tutorial full of people that lack faces.I had nightmares for a few weeks, but then continued playing it.You play as some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a dead-end job who's ancestors were successful assassins and actually did things with their lives.While playing as an assassin, you can run up to innocent people, jump on their faces, and stab them in plain sight. Don't worry about being publicly shunned or being prosecuted, because the guards won't be able to find you as long as you sit in a garden or jump into a pile of hay. And everyone has 30-second memory, so nobody will remember you. Your first mission is to betray your brotherhood and get a member killed.Very exciting game.Buy it on the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.org and use coupon code ""teddybear"" for a 5% discount.			"

												Refreshing Game as i am new to the AC series. I wanted to play the entire series from start to finish and what a way to start. It is almost a complete game for me, I am familiar with other reviews this game has received and some negativity. But you hardly notice any fault as you play this game. Its a lot of fun, and it is what i look for in games such as this. A lot of climbing and jumping, the fighting mechanics is awesome compared to other games. I can go on for hours with the good.A few bad points;1. Running into people, may loose control of player.2. Cut away scenes get annoying after a while.3. Player jumps onto walls repeatedly gets annoying as it makes no progress climbing.Get this game if you like to have fun. Something they forgot about in AC Unity			"

												I believe that this game is one of the timeless classics. It's the beginning of one of the most popular game series of all time, and it shows why this game spawned such a cash cow. It's still very playable to this day, and although it doesn't have near as much content compared to modern games, it still really is just a good game despite that. I probably wouldn't pay full price for it, but I would definitely grab it at a reduced price.			"

												I first played Black Flag and loved it so much that I wanted to start this series from the beginning. Going back in time to 2007, the parkour was slow and the combat even slower. The storyline was weak and pretty linear. However:Despite the flaws it was still very fun and unlike Black Flag, the side story set in the present is actually just as interesting as the main historical story. Also, while the storyline is repettitive (is that how you spell it?),♥♥♥♥♥♥does get kinda crazy towards the end. Play it through if you want to get the full Assassin's Creed storyline. If not, I'd skip to a later one. I wish there was a nuetral rating for games on steam. I enjoyed it though, so I'll give it a thumbs up.			"

												It looks like Assassins Creed is becoming one of the best games I've played, at least, in a long time. A cliché filled epic that blends history and real locations with a fictional, yet suspenseful storyline. Immersion is the key, and Assassins Creed provides, even (without spoiling too much) in two realms.Graphics wise I didn't expect as much as I got. Even with Antialiasing disabled the game looks vibrant and alive (you can force it on through a text file, default with higher resolutions is 0).As for the controls, I'm guessing it's smoother when played with a pad. Although the pc configuration works, at times it can feel a little sticky.The game has also some informational value; I for one had no idea how huge the city of Jerusalem really was, before I rode to the walls myself.I would suggest this game to anyone who likes open world/action/sneaking games or just medieval themes in general.

												The first entry in the never ending Assassin's Creed franchise. This game is what started it all for Ubisoft, love 'em or hate 'em. This game features a conflict between Templars and Assassins in a historical setting. If you love history then this is a great game for you. The atmosphere in the game is very good, it makes you feel like you're alone in this dark and deadly journey for redemption. The three main cities you explore are nice and detailed. The stealth aspect isn't perfect, but it is interesting and fun to play with. The combat is also interesting, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes easy. The story, if you pay attention, is great and mysterious. There's also a parcour system that allows you to climb buildings all sneaky like.However, this game has many flaws. Towards mid-game point, the game becomes very repetitive, having you doing the same missions over and over again. What sucks is that to progress in the game, you must do these boring missions to get the next piece in the story. At points you might not care for the good story this game has because of tedious tasks. I love history and conspiracies, so this game was right up the alley for me. The combat and stealth was intersting at first but the game does get repetitive. I really like this game and it's one of the better ones in the franchise in my opinion. It's a risk, but you might enjoy this game if you're more into story than gameplay.			"

The controls work really well,and it looks great, but there are points in the game where I sit watching nothing, and listening to dialog that doesn't at all help me, or add to my enjoyment of the game. There are times where the game feels action packed and other times where tasks feel tedious. That's what usually causes me to lose interest.

												NOT A BAD GAME AT ALL, BUT I CANNOT RECOMMEND IT -Graphics in 2008 = 10/10 (we all got hooked because of the graphics)-Graphics NOW = 9/10 (still great, with powerful 2010-2014 computers this game WILL SHINE on max settings)-Story = 3/10 boring, cheesy and confusing, the beginning of the Apples of Eden/Abstergo/Desmond Miles B.S. story, lol-Gameplay = 6/10 decent stealth (though not perfect by a long shot) + block and parry combat; no bugs, though repetitive; you'll also have problems trying to switch arms during combat, since you must first unlock the target (yeah, it sounds confusing because it is)-Save system = 0/10, just the typical autosave checkpoint S-H-I-T that will AUTOERASE itself if you quit the game before finishing a mission (you'll get mad if your pc freezes while on a mission, you'll have to start it since the beginning)-Replay value = 4/10 (the final save file will allow you to randomly replay ANY mission, so no point in playing the whole thing again since the beginning; as I've said, the story is lame)conclusion: the first AC was kind of barebones and unpolished (despite the gorgeous graphics); I'd recommend it only for those interested in the Crusades, since it's AWESOME to roam across the 12th Century Jerusalem-Damascus-Acre and to kick some (original) templar♥♥♥♥♥ but this game offers nothing more; for people interested mainly in the gameplay, I say jump directly to AC II			"

												The Good: Amazing story, beautifully created visually and technically, lots of different missions to complete, parkour and crowd system are unique and revolutionary, DirectX 10 looks greatThe Bad: Some control and clipping issues, extremely repetitive missions, not very diverse visually, crowd simulation gets predictable and repetitiveNothing is true. Everything is permitted. This is a saying heard throughout Assassin's Creed and it really sticks with you. So does the thick plot that has come to take the game industry by storm as well as one of the greatest game characters of all time: Altair. The plot is actually weird at first because it's a sci-fi story. You are actually Desmond Miles capture by modern world Templars. They stick you in an Animus and use your DNA to access your ancestors memories to find the Piece of Eden which can be used to control people's minds. That one ancestor is Altair set during the crusades. The second story is of Altair who ends up losing his rank and status among the Assassin Brotherhood by failing a mission due to eagerness and stupidity. Your master, Al Mualim, sends on special missions to assassinate key leaders throughout the holy land (Acre, Jerusalem, and Damascus) to keep them from taking the Piece of Eden and using it to win the war.As you can see the plot is very interesting with a lot of twists. How is the game though? You have a huge open world that are full of side missions and hundreds of buildings to climb. Assassin's Creed has a parkour climbing system as well as a puppeteering system. You control each of Altair's limbs in two different states. The ""socially acceptable"" state allows you to use eagle vision which can show enemies and key targets. You can gently push people away from you and this is key because is you're running around the city knocking people over the guards will come after you, and towards the end of the game everyone is highly suspicious of you and just a few people knocked over will have the entire guard on your tail. The third thing is obviously combat, but if you hold down the run button you start climbing buildings, grabbing people to toss them, and jumping around.Assassin's Creed really tried to introduce crowd psychology into the game and it works here, but does feel limited. If you climb buildings people will react by stopping and staring and saying things accordingly. If you use ladders people don't mind so much. While using rooftops is faster and keeps you away from most guards you must watch out for guards on rooftops who will shoot you with arrows if you don't get down, kill them, or move away quickly. The climbing works well enough, but there are some controls issues, clipping issues, and other issues with the camera. When Altair is facing a different way then the camera he will jump towards his way instead of the way you're telling him too. Also, if you run around a pole or near a crate he'll start climbing it instead of just jumping over or going around. This can get down right frustrating when you are running away from a dozen guards and trying to find a hiding spot.The game also introduces anonymity via a symbol near your health bar which stays white when no ones suspects you, but will turn yellow when you are watched and flash red when guards are on to you. When it does this get away quickly or kill whomever is watching you. Don't just kill out in the open or people will run around screaming and call guards. Get away from dead bodies quickly because guards will come by and try to find who killed them or citizens will give you away. If you are caught you need to kill all guards after you or hide. To do this you must break their line of sight and the symbol will flash yellow. When it does find a hiding spot quickly before it turns red again. You can hide on benches between people, stacks of hay, in groups of monks praying, or draped boxes on rooftops. Stay there for a few seconds and you will by anonymous again. You can avoid all this chaos by just jogging, staying calm, don't flail around and jump around like a monkey in crowded areas etc.This whole crowd system is really something else and works well, but feels repetitive and predictable because of the recycled sayings, animations, and it always happens the same way. The combat is the same way because while you can gain new abilities it feels like a counter fest. You can attack with a sword or short sword, throw daggers, but most guards always block and you just stand there with the block button held down and wait for someone to attack and then counter which is usually an instant kill. This gets repetitive and the combat isn't as deep as it could be since combos are limited, and animations are repeated often. It does control well and feels smooth so I guess that's better than broken.The most repetitive thing, and the game's biggest flaw, are the constantly repeated missions that repeat dozens and dozens of times. You can save citizens, do some time trial flag gathering missions, escort missions, assassination missions (probably the most fun), interrogation, eavesdropping, pickpocketing, and climbing tall buildings to find view points to put more missions on your map in that area. Sure they are fun at first, but after you have saved the 30th citizen, or climbed the 50th building it gets old and you just want it to end. Some more mission diversity would have been nice.While its cool to be an assassin, sneaking up behind a guard and shoving a punch dagger in his gut, and then running away while he falls to the ground without anyone suspecting otherwise is satisfying you must look good doing it too. Assassin's Creed looks amazing, even today, and the PC version sports DirectX 10 graphics with some slightly higher resolution textures. The game looks a lot better than console versions and is well worth another play through just for that alone. While the graphics are amazing technically, artistically the game feels very Middle Eastern with a great soundtrack to support that, voice acting, and the whole game feels true to its time. The architecture is great, the clothing, lifestyles, and jobs people do in the game, but it all does kind of look the same with a lot of greys, browns, and whites.Overall Assassin's Creed is an amazing experience with a story you will talk about long after you finish the game, great crowd simulation, and the true feeling of being an assassin. If there was some more mission diversity, visual diversity, and smoother controls the game would be perfect. This is a game you can not miss and every gaming fan should play this.~Score: 8.5/10			"

												Assassin's Creed is one of those gems that, in my opinion, was a good departure from Prince of Persia. Having played all the Princes, the storyline of Assassin's Creed hooked me immediately! It blended historical fact-fiction with some modern ideas, and because I am a sucker for conspiracy theories, the whole idea of a corporation exploiting individuals for some 'thing of power' grabbed me completely. I was an Assassin, going from city to city, killing the evil do'ers and saving mankind.What did I like? The graphics for its time was superb, a testament to dedicated artists showing their trait. It still kind of stands up even today and even though we have become numb to 4K and HDR, the quality of the work that went into this game was tremendous.  As I said, the story was brilliant and intriguing.  The battle sequences made you feel mighty and in control.What didn't I like? I think the scope of the game was fantastic for its time, but the gameplay could get somewhat repetive.  The locations were brilliantly done, but after a while all the alleys and soldiers started looking the same.  The game tried to mix things up by giving you different ways to approach a kill, but in the end, you just needed to damage the boss enough to win.  No assassation needed!  This I didn't like so much.A true start to a great series.			"

I'd recommend this to any Assassin's Creed fan or a stealth fan, maybe even to some fighting fans, since you can also take a break from stealthing and murder about everyone you see.			"

												This is my favorite of the series I think because of the time it takes place. And its in an area of the world I have always wanted to visit. This game as are the sequels, very detailed and gorgeous graphically. The Story is something that other developers could take a few lessons from in its consistency and scope while maintaining a huge level of open ended game play. Take the time to sit back and become a master swordsman as you travel from city to city. You will become so good that you will never be touched by a sword again regardless of the number of  foes (timing is everything). Buy this game at any price but it is a steal when on sale.			"

												For an almost 10 year old game it still holds up to this day and is definitely worth picking up if you've never played an Assassin's Creed game before.The game tells a story of Desmond Miles - a descendant of Assassins - a secret organisation fighting with Templars. While Assassins strive to preserve freedom - Templars seek to control people. Desmond who lives in modern times is put by Templars into Animus with which he can access genetic memories of his ancestors and re-lives the events happening in the third crusade times.The game is very atmospheric. The cities you visit during the game are big and extremely atmospheric. It really does feel like a crusader movie. The movement - ability to climb any building, run on the rooftops is very well done. The whole scope of the game does look impress. For the times this was released it is very impressive. Even today it still looks very good and holds its own.During the game you will kill a number of templars. And while all the tools seem to be present the game feels a bit repetitive. Each mission follows pretty much the same schematic - follow someone and eavesdrop on conversation to learn something, beat someone up, pickpocket someone else. In the end it does not affect the main mission much though. With additional Ubisoft dis tractors - climbing towers to reveal map and so on it's a completionist nightmare. Even more so that the side missions are even more repetitive than the core plot. The main missions at least vary from each other and are really fun to do.The strength of this game lies within stealth. Blending with the crowd, picking routes to avoid detection to deal the final blow. When executed properly it's really satisfying. The combat is a bit too easy. All you have to do is wait for a queue to counter and you can fight off a hundred men. The only problem I had was with an XBox controller which for some reason does not work well with the PC version of the game. And some keys are bound in a strange way without ability to re-bind them. Even using community fixes I couldn't get it to work exactly as it should. The whole story of Desmond Miles is a bit weak - and personally I would prefer for it to be strictly about Altair.Overall the game still holds up - worth picking up and playing through.			"

												The Good: Amazing story, beautifully created visually and technically, lots of different missions to complete, parkour and crowd system are unique and revolutionary, DirectX 10 looks greatThe Bad: Some control and clipping issues, extremely repetitive missions, not very diverse visually, crowd simulation gets predictable and repetitiveNothing is true. Everything is permitted. This is a saying heard throughout Assassin's Creed and it really sticks with you. So does the thick plot that has come to take the game industry by storm as well as one of the greatest game characters of all time: Altair. The plot is actually weird at first because it's a sci-fi story. You are actually Desmond Miles capture by modern world Templars. They stick you in an Animus and use your DNA to access your ancestors memories to find the Piece of Eden which can be used to control people's minds. That one ancestor is Altair set during the crusades. The second story is of Altair who ends up losing his rank and status among the Assassin Brotherhood by failing a mission due to eagerness and stupidity. Your master, Al Mualim, sends on special missions to assassinate key leaders throughout the holy land (Acre, Jerusalem, and Damascus) to keep them from taking the Piece of Eden and using it to win the war.As you can see the plot is very interesting with a lot of twists. How is the game though? You have a huge open world that are full of side missions and hundreds of buildings to climb. Assassin's Creed has a parkour climbing system as well as a puppeteering system. You control each of Altair's limbs in two different states. The ""socially acceptable"" state allows you to use eagle vision which can show enemies and key targets. You can gently push people away from you and this is key because is you're running around the city knocking people over the guards will come after you, and towards the end of the game everyone is highly suspicious of you and just a few people knocked over will have the entire guard on your tail. The third thing is obviously combat, but if you hold down the run button you start climbing buildings, grabbing people to toss them, and jumping around.Assassin's Creed really tried to introduce crowd psychology into the game and it works here, but does feel limited. If you climb buildings people will react by stopping and staring and saying things accordingly. If you use ladders people don't mind so much. While using rooftops is faster and keeps you away from most guards you must watch out for guards on rooftops who will shoot you with arrows if you don't get down, kill them, or move away quickly. The climbing works well enough, but there are some controls issues, clipping issues, and other issues with the camera. When Altair is facing a different way then the camera he will jump towards his way instead of the way you're telling him too. Also, if you run around a pole or near a crate he'll start climbing it instead of just jumping over or going around. This can get down right frustrating when you are running away from a dozen guards and trying to find a hiding spot.The game also introduces anonymity via a symbol near your health bar which stays white when no ones suspects you, but will turn yellow when you are watched and flash red when guards are on to you.

To do this you must break their line of sight and the symbol will flash yellow. When it does find a hiding spot quickly before it turns red again. You can hide on benches between people, stacks of hay, in groups of monks praying, or draped boxes on rooftops. Stay there for a few seconds and you will by anonymous again. You can avoid all this chaos by just jogging, staying calm, don't flail around and jump around like a monkey in crowded areas etc.This whole crowd system is really something else and works well, but feels repetitive and predictable because of the recycled sayings, animations, and it always happens the same way.

												Great game. Honestly though, I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price. Wait until it's on sale. It does connect with AC2 but if you skip this game and go straight to 2, you're honestly not missing much. You might be a little confused with the story but as you progress you'll get the gist. If you like to feel immersed in the story as I do, I recommend buying it but buy it on sale. If you're just looking to purchase an Assassin's Creed game, I'd say go with AC2 or Black Flag.The character does not move fluidly. You'll find yourself jumping to the wrong thing, trying to run up a wall where you should've grabbed the ledge, not climbing onto the roof where you should be able to, getting out of a hiding spot only to find yourself climbing onto the edge of the hiding spot, sometimes you'll refuse to climb onto a viewpoint. The missions are repetitive. You do the same thing in every city in every chapter while the cities mostly look the same. The main characters voice is absolutely terrible. Comming from the Holy Land, you would think a dude named Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad would have a middle eastern accent as ezio has an italian accent. NOPE, you're a white dude.If you don't care about feeling immersed, read the wiki on ac then skip to ac2 and go from there.			"

Theres no happy moments no friends to hang out with, Altair was a born and breed Assassin soon to be Master, your mission is to kill 12 targets your master has given you to redeem yourself.Its simple:- Gather intel- Plan- Assassinate your target- Get in.. Get outAssassins Creed 1 is True to its objective, theres a brotherhood and a Master something the rest of the sequels fail to understand. It's not an adventure game where the main protagainst goes on adventures its about the life of an Assassin.The real reason why Assassin's Creed game story fails everytime is because of the ""Animus"", the game is nothing without the animus of course, but you don't get to see how the character lives you're constantly skipping through time, You don't know what your favourite Assasins food is? what his favoruite colour is? what his favourite weapon to use throwing knives? Sword? their opinion of the hidden blade.Ubisoft releases a book of their game with more in-depth story and details, why can't they make the story of the book into their games...			"

												-If landing in hay bales kills you enable vsync-Each game is like a story expansion of the one before it, with some extra new bits that sometimes are fun, but other times just get in the way. I'm glad they're taking a year off. They need it. That said, this is one of my favorite series. Its like medieval GTA. The writing and story ideas I enjoy a lot. The first game will seem pretty bland if you've played anything newer. But I liked this era the most and Altair is my favorite.I'd say pick it up on a deal if you're iffy about something a little aged with some repeated aspects throughout the whole game. 20 is kinda steep. If you didn't play it way back when, it might be a tough fit. But I can't really bring myself not to recommend just out of enjoying the philosophy of it.			"

												Assassin's Creed is one of those gems that, in my opinion, was a good departure from Prince of Persia. Having played all the Princes, the storyline of Assassin's Creed hooked me immediately! It blended historical fact-fiction with some modern ideas, and because I am a sucker for conspiracy theories, the whole idea of a corporation exploiting individuals for some 'thing of power' grabbed me completely. I was an Assassin, going from city to city, killing the evil do'ers and saving mankind.What did I like? The graphics for its time was superb, a testament to dedicated artists showing their trait. It still kind of stands up even today and even though we have become numb to 4K and HDR, the quality of the work that went into this game was tremendous.  As I said, the story was brilliant and intriguing.  The battle sequences made you feel mighty and in control.What didn't I like? I think the scope of the game was fantastic for its time, but the gameplay could get somewhat repetive.  The locations were brilliantly done, but after a while all the alleys and soldiers started looking the same.  The game tried to mix things up by giving you different ways to approach a kill, but in the end, you just needed to damage the boss enough to win.  No assassation needed!  This I didn't like so much.A true start to a great series.			"

												I want to mention that this is my second time when I finish this game, the first time I've did almost 7 years ago, on a pirated copy. I didn't remember much from that period because I was young and didn't payed too much attention to the story or the details, so I really enjoyed this second playthrough, because I was able to learn much more.Impressions & Score:Story: 9 out of 10The story in Assassin's Creed is very captivating and fascinating, because it uses historical characters.  The main plot is that the history of religion as we know it's a lie and the people were manipulated using advanced technology to believe certain facts. The action in the game takes place in september 2012 (5 years after the game was launched in 2007) and the main protagonist is Desmond, who is forced to relive the memories of his ancestor Altair using a machine called the Animus, by an umbrella corporation ABSTERGO, in order to find some lost artifacts. The memories of Altair are from the year 1191 during the Crusades and it involves the Templars and the Assassins, templars found the truth and wanted to use the advanced object to control the population and make order in the world, while the assassins  think that peace should be attained by choice and not imposed, and they will try to stop them.  While the idea of the story is very good, the way is told, isn't very clear and by the end of the game you'll have more questions than answers. Also at the end of the game you'll be able to see some cryptic messages and images, for which I strongly advise to search explanation on the internet, because they are very  interesting. Overall I will give a good score for the story, mostly because of it's original idea. Graphics: 9 out of 10The graphics in this game are good, not exceptional but good. I really liked how the lighting was done and the design of each city. There are of course flaws and multiple glitches and some details are poorly done (like certain trees or the water), this is why I cannot give the maximum score. Does the graphics really deserve a 9? Some of you might disagree, but the high score is because of a personal preference for the time period, and not from a technical point of view. Gameplay: 6.5 out of 10Yes, even if the gameplay was cool for 2007 and was considered innovative by many, for me it wasn't the case. The jump system and moves were similar to another good game: Prince of Persia, with a lot of improvements, of course. So why a medium score? Well, first because the majority of the investigations and missions are repetitive as hell which becomes boring after the third time you do them, because the AI follows predefined paths, because the assassinations are almost always the same: I'm refering only to the options to kill your target, not the cutscenes (so the investigations become even more pointless, since the outcome is always the same), because the fighting is very simple and you can rarely die in this game (I've played the game with no HUD interface at all: no sync bar, gps etc. and died just a few times in combat and that because I was rushing  to kill my enemies), because most of the characters have no personality, because of no unique abilities for the enemy targets etc. After all this list of bugs/errors, you probably wonder why I gave it a 6 and not a 2, I guess because it's fun, the game is really casual and I've did all the repetitive investigations for the story details, which is a very good story. Audio: 8.5 out of 10The audio is good, but I would have prefered to hear more diverse soundtracks, especially during combat.AI Behavior: 7 out of 10The AI is bad, repetitive and sometimes glitchy. The high score is not because of the fighting system or the guards, it's because of the people inside the cities and the horses, which move realistic. I really liked to see this type of behavior, the crowd has a very good collision system and that makes cities feel alive. I can only appreciate this type of work done by the programmers, but I cannot say the same about the fighting which is repetitive and easy, with just 2 combinations you can defeat dozens of enemies, the only challenge that you'll have when facing AI enemies is numbers, not quality. The are a lot of funny situations where the AI behaves like a complete idiot, for example: not seeing that you jump right in front of them in a pile of hay , or not seeing that you just killed one of their friends a few meters from them (I'm not talking about stealth kill here, I'm talking about the stupid soldiers that don't react when there is a fight a few meters from them - I mean Ubisoft could have increased their detection range when the combat music starts, so that every soldier nearby can come and help his comrades), falling like idiots from buildings ( just try and make 10 soldiers or more follow you on a cliff or a tall building in the Kingdom area, and then do a ledge grab: you'll notice that the idiots cannot attack you and they will start to push each other off the building and die, until only 3-4 remain) etc. The AI needs a lot of work in the next sequels.Multiplayer: noneOverall: 8 out 10This is a good game, the great things about this game are it's story, the graphics and the main character Altair. The bad things, well the main bad things are enemy AI and the repetitive missions, I can pardon Ubisoft for a weak AI, since the game, overall is well made, but I don't like the fact that they were very lazy in designing the investigations, I mean on the Xbox and Playstation, they are just 4 investigation types that repeat 5-6 times, and on the PC they added just 2 more which also repeat 5-6 times throught the game. They could have added small details, like names for each character that gives you a mission, or more interesting side assassinations etc. , details that will remove a bit from the feeling of repeating the same activity over and over again in each district, in each city. They left the investigations to be done at random but in the memory block they put a specific order, I didn't liked this stuff, since  you either give me full free choice or you make it linear (I don't like doing an investigation and then seing that it was actually the 4th one in the memory block and that I should have done 3 others before it). I recommend buying the game, especially now that it costs less than 10 EUR, I paid less than 2.5 EUR during a sale on steam, but be warned that the end leaves many things unanswered, so you'll want to buy the sequel and the one after it, etc.  I will start doing the sequel now, I'll be back with the next review.

												Assassin's Creed plays more like a proof of concept or demo than a full game; the missions have no variety and there's very little to do outside of them. However, what it does, it does well, and fleeing from the scene of your assassination is a part of gameplay that is sorely missing from later entries in the series. The environments are repetitve being all variations on ""Middle Eastern city"", with Acre being the most memorable. The story following Altair is enjoyable, the Desmond sections feel like ana fterthought.			"

												First instalment of the series, baby steps. The game itself is still nice to play even today, it seems the graphics have been made universal and are not that bad. Gameplay, every action is like an animation, until it's finished, nothing else can be done. This is also noticable when jumping the roofs, loads of falling into the streets.The Storyline is what captures the most in my opinion. Although it is attempted to recreate historical places and characters, I would probably guess most of the stuff is still fictional.Lets talk numbers. 9 bosses, 9 zones. Each zone: 8 citizens to save, 8 viewpoints to see, 6 side missions to unlock information: 1 pickpocket, 1 eavesdropping, 1 beatup, 1 assassinations, 1 flags collection, 1 roof parkout. You must do 2-3 side missions to unlock boss fight. After 3rd boss this is getting into a repetitive chore. Although there is increase in guards/npcs, it is still repetitive.Overall the game is nice, minimum bugs, good game play, still good time sink. Big thumbs up for no Uplay stuff yet, good things of an old title.Do recommend.			"

												Although I always wanted to play the Assassin's Creed games, I didn't get a chance until recently. Totally glad I did. I'm having a lot of fun. Sure, some of the graphics are a little dated now, but were state of the art when the game was originally released. Also, a controller is a must have, the keyboard/mouse combo is so difficult it makes the game nearly impossible. Can't wait to finish this game and start the next.			"

												AC Review:Wow! It took me a long time to finally get into the AC franchise, but I'm very pleased that I did.Basic info on equipment: HP Pavilion dv6-6123cl entertainment notebook. Processor AMD A6-3400M APU w/Radeon HD Graphics 1.40 GHz. Installed RAM of 6 GB. 64-Bit Windows 10 OS. Wired external mouse and keyboard. No additional equipment used or upgrades made to computer.Gameplay & Controls 5/10: Definitely the most challenging aspect of this game, many times to the point of being tedious and irritating because you end up repeating some tasks multiple times before succeeding. (Another reviewer mentioned something about yelling and/or pounding on the table because of frustration with the controls. That may have happened more than once with me as well...) This was partly due to the fact that I was playing this on a PC and the controls really don't translate well from console to PC. It was exceedingly difficult to coordinate some of the movements, especially during combat scenarios and when you were sprinting. To say that I sprinted into walls a few times while trying to turn sharp corners would be an understatement. This was the only factor, in my opinion, that made the game unpleasant to play. If I tried it with an XBox 360 controller or something similar installed, it might have made a big difference.Graphics 9/10:  Holy mackerel! For the year in which this game was released, I was totally blown away by the quality of the graphics. Given that it was released only two years after Elder Scrolls Oblivion, I was expecting graphics only slightly better than that game, but not even Skyrim -- which came out four years after AC -- is this realistic or amazing (and I happen to really love Skyrim, so that's saying something). Huge positive factor for this game, as it really makes you feel immersed in the world. *Side note: For the horse-lovers out there (like me) you're going to want to spend as much time in one section of the game as possible because you get to ride some of the most realistic in-game horses I've ever seen. Did I mention Skyrim? Yeah. It doesn't hold a candle to AC in terms of the horses.Storyline 7/10:  While the story within the game is fascinating and entertaining, it's also not terribly accurate in some ways. If you're not at all concerned with that sort of thing, then this rating means nothing, but for those of us who appreciate history, it can be frustrating to see otherwise excellent games not get something right or deliberately alter important events just to suit the story. And honestly, the Templars are a rather misunderstood group, and it was dismaying to see them so badly maligned in this game. They really don't deserve it. *Side note: Christians, be aware that this game holds morality to be a thing relative to the person. (Of course, if you're okay with playing a game like this in the first place, then this aspect of the game shouldn't really surprise or bother you.) There are characters who deliberately state that certain things we hold sacred and true are nothing more than illusions or lies. Just be prepared for that when you play and remember that you *don't* have to buy into everything the game says in order to enjoy it. It's just a form of dynamic storytelling.Overall Rating 7/10:  I found this game to be tremendously enjoyable to play, especially once I started to get the hang of the otherwise frustrating controls. Said controls remained difficult enough that they distracted a bit from the game, but the amazing graphics and engrossing in-game story balanced it out so much that I would play it again in a heartbeat and am looking forward to continuing in the franchise.(Oh, and the only other complaint I have -- a minor one at that -- is the fact that you have to travel through about five or six different game screens before you can exit. Tedious, I tell you!)			"

You dare be a Templar in my presence? That will cost you your life!  The first Assassins Creed is a damn fine game and one of the first things that truly got me interested in history. I find the story and the setting to be most intriguing and honestly I would recommend the game on those two merits alone.  Progression of skill is something in this game I remember well and it really bothers me that they did away with that in the later entries. In this game there is a true sense of progression of skill as you go through your missions, learning new ways to fight and perfecting your movement.  When I first started playing I hardly knew how to move around or use my sword properly but by the end it became easier and more fluid purely through practice and earned skill.  And that's something I really miss.			"

												Assassin's Creed. A decent first entry to a great franchise. This game is a solid 6/10 for mePros:-Great story.-Good characters.-Good graphics (for its time)-Great combat and parkourCons:-The gameplay gets VERY repetetive after a few missions. Basically doing the same stuff over and over again with minor changes.-There is little to no replay value due to its repetetivity and the fact that there are FAR superior entries to this franchise-No subtitlesOVERALL:This game isn't a must-have, not even for fans of the franchise, but it's cheap, so it's worth it			"

												Much like the first Mass Effect, Assassin's Creed is more noteworthy for what it tried to achieve than what it actually did. The missions are somewhat repetitive and the AI is occasionally confoundingly clumsy but the nested narrative is oddly compelling, helping to set up one of the most iconic lores in modern gaming. The sheer freedom it grants you goes well beyond what even some of the later games in the series achieved, offering myriad ways to handle each assassination rather than relying on the constraining 'optional objectives' that were relied on so heavily in Revelations and III, and despite its age it still looks bloody gorgeous. With it's nuanced storytelling and intuitive combat and freerunning, AC far exceeds its shortcomings.			"

												It's hard to put this game anywhere. It came out in 2007 and it was so boring I struggled to finish it till 2016 and I came out surprised. This game isn't as bad as others claim it to be. Yeah the gameplay gets really... REALLY mundane, but there are some aspects that are actually way better here than in newer AC games. For one we actually gather information about our targets, though unfortunately in very monotone ways. We report back on what we've done. I could actually feel like an assassin that fits the game's context. After AC Revelations that feel started to disappear and it did after AC IV Black Flag. This doesn't mean they're bad games only that they're different.The story of the game kept me going forward. After each kill I got just as doubtful as Altaïr did. This game actually has a great character development. First we have a big ego and by the end we're wiser then our masters. What is really awesome is how well the game aged. The controls are easy to get used to and the fighting system here is spectacular compared to other ACs. Cool killing animations, nice combo system and good controls again. The only negative about this whole game is how it repeats itself, 9 times... It lacks any kind of customization to your character and also the world in this game especially ""The Kingdom"" feels very weak. They do not offer any reward for exploring other than some flags and templars to kill that you get achievements for... on consoles.All in all after finishing this game from last place it is now among the top 5 in my best AC games list and I'd recommend it to anyone who is just like me or someone who is considering getting into this franchise.

												Rating is 9/10 Reason is because it’s a bit repetitive and you need some skill option customization. The first Assassin's Creed game. Really cool story line and good graphics as well as mechanics. Not too bad on PC but it’s more for console gamers. A good game worth the money still today.  "

												My experience was probably skewed since I finished Assassins Creed 2 before playing this one. Anyways, the game feels really repetitive, the landscape is gorgeous but the cities look pretty much the same. The game is only interesting during the beginning and during the end, the middle part is really tedious. I liked playing it, but it's nothing like it's sucessor. I recommend playing only if you really want to know the beginning of the AC series or if you have never played an AC game before.  "

												Simple and fun, but gets really repetive really quick. I'm personally not a big fan of the combat.The parkour is really fun and probably the main reason I play this game. I have no idea what's going on in the story because I don't listen to it, but damn the parkour is fun.But anyways, it provides a few hours of good entertainment. I've heard the other Assassin's Creed games are better though. Still a nice game!			"

												I'm conflicted, I would like to say this game is great and everyone should buy it. However, on a 1 to 10 scale I would honestly have to give it a 5.5, but no higher then a 6. From my history of playing this games series, what really sucked me in back in 2008 (ish, I don't exactly recall the date) was from an Assassin's Creed YouTube trailer featuring ""Lonely Soul"" by Unkle. So there's Altair walking down an empty street in what looks to be the lone swordsman routine when, Bam, out pops an ten inch hidden blade. Yeah, there were other trailers like the one where he storms a hanging with a crossbow, but the song did it for me. So, I bought it, and, then as I do now, I still hate the game. And I still love the game. HUH?Let me explain...- I felt like it never got to use the hidden blade as much as I would like to.- He never go to use a crossbow. It almost felt like a like, but whatever.- He will smack into walls as if he was drunk... constantly. I spent days shouting, ""What are you?...I didn't want to go that way? Why did you jump off that building? Did you have to kill another random person? WTF you can't swim?!!""- He can't swim. Yes, the master assassin will drown in the shallow end of the kiddie pool, floaties and all.- The first 40 minutes are hell. In fact, I almost gave up just from the droll that pored from Lucy, Desmond and the Dr.- The game could have stood alone with out a the cutscenes with Desmond. And Ubi wisely turned some of those 'inner' scenes into missions that were more fun later on.- You're required to learn almost every new move he's given, which also slows down the game.- You will hate the hordes of NPC's running between you and the combat. So, why even play it?  - Boredom. Seriously. - It has a unique storyline. - I actually contemplated some of the philosophy. - Altair is a one-shot wonder with his throwing knives. He will kill almost anyone with one blade, too bad I can't say the same later in the series.- Sometimes when he turns the wrong way or runs off ledges, it's comical. And frustrating. - Stealing throwing knives is easier then buying them.- No monetary system, this is both good and bad, but in this game it worked. - The ending is was worth the wait.As you can see, I am split in my decision as to whether like or hate this game.What really bothers me the most is after 10 years Ubisoft has flatly refused to clean up the mess of what could really be a great game. I've been fantasized about playing a ""remastered"" or ""anniversary"" edition of the original AC with the graphics cleaned up, better playability and--god forbid--enjoyable cutaways with Desmond. Anyway, that was my 2¢. Thanks for reading.			"

												Pros:- takes longer to climb buildings which is in a way more realistic.- makes you feel like a real Assassin due to the need to gather information about your targets.- Cool time setting. - It's Assassin's Creed.Cons:- Clunky movement.- Bad AI.- Quite average combat compared to today's games. - Repetitive Story. Not high on my lists of good and well made Assassin's Creed games, or games in general, but it's still alright.			"

												Visually stunning game that suffers from crude story and repetitive gameplay. The game basically consists of killing nine victim's in three beautifully designed cities. To find their whereabouts you climb up all the city towers to reveal informers. Those ask for one of four quest types (time challenges, pick pocket, eavesdropping or interrogation) to be completed to share information with you. You can also help various citizen harrassed by guards (by slaying the guards). Doing all that takes about 90 minutes until you finally get to the victim (which means you can easily beat the game at a weekend). Combat is mainly clicking at the right moment to initiate a combo or counter attack and looks pretty cool, like really all character movement in the game. The game could have been much more though if it had a more compelling story and more mission variation. Still, entertaining.			"
