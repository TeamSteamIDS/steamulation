TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:An old game (by the time I wrote this review) but a great game nonetheless.As you might know, this is a Star Wars game based on the Clone Wars era where you are the leader of an elite Clone Commando Unit tasked with some of the most dangerous and most critical missions in service of the Galactic Republic.PROS:+ Story: -Amazing story that places you not in the eyes of a skillful Jedi or a powerful Sith, but in the boots of Clone Troopers fighting the war. The game delivers in terms of story with its superior voice acting by Temuera Morrison (Jango Fett) as well and the various personalities of your squad mates really adds to the experience.+ Squad Mechanics: -You cannot Rambo (go solo) this game, mainly because the squad is mandatory, BUT also because the game is brutal as hell (like most old FPS games). Enemies are really hard to kill without your squad's support requiring the players to properly order their squads into position and direct their fire when necessary.+ Graphically pleasing despite its age: -Released on 2005, this game carries a dated visual design, but pleasing nonetheless. Animation is good and the atmosphere is immersive. (I simply love the HUD in this game)+ Sound: -One of the greatest OST I have ever heard. (Vode An is the greatest of these OST)+ Gameplay: -Lengthy campaign without getting boring: There is always action around the corner.CONS:- Squad AI is a bit limited: -Although the AI, for the most part, is intelligent and is far more useful than some of the other AI partners in modern games, I feel as though a bit more could have been done. They follow command well enough.- Bugged Graphic setting in terms of Bump Mapping: -Remained unfix to this day. (can be turned off in the options menu though)Additional Note:The game is linear (corridor shooting), from start to finish. THIS IS NOT A BAD THING PEOPLE. Not all games need to be open world, specially if the game, such as this one, is trying to properly tell the story in a progressive fashion giving the player a sense of direction and purpose.CONCLUSION:MUST BUY and MUST OWN for any Star Wars fan or First Person Shooter fans.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												People often complain about the stone-faced, bald and monotomous space marines in videogames; how they're an extremely overused template and stifle the development of round characters. Republic Commando puts an interesting spin on this complaint: It gives you four clones; four space marines. That's where the complaining ends.Republic Commando is a squad based shooter set in the Star Wars universe during the Clone Wars. You play Delta 38 ""Boss"", leader of a highly specialised and extremely elite squad of Clones. You're bred with a great affinity for your clone bretheren. Your squad is as much a part of your arsenal as your special rifles and armour. Repulic Commando translates this premise to gameplay in an absolutely incredible way. You can 'direct' your squad to perform tasks while you hold off the enemy. Or you can work on the objective while you let them hold the line. The surprise in this comes from their intelligence. More often than not, CPU allies are less than helpful. Not the Clone Commandos; they are in a league of their own. They take, and move through cover, hide when the odds are against them, secure the area before helping you instead of running in headlong, and their aim is about as good as your own, so they don't feel considerably overpowered. What also helps is a careful balance of enemies. There are just enough in each room to keep it interesting, but never too many to make it feel like a grindfest. Your three squadmates (and yourself) are the bread and butter of the game's presentation. 2005 graphics haven't aged so dignified, but the artstyle gets the job done. Everything looks slightly grittier and messier than it does in the films. You'll quickly determine this when you use the melee button a droid for the first time and the grease and battery acid are wiped off your visor with a laser. The helmet display resembles that of Metroid Prime a lot, complete with ambient effects and splatter. But, enough about the visuals, the real fun is in the sound. You, and your brothers engage in a lot comic banter to keep spirits up. You, the boss are the tough as nails leader, voiced by Mr Jango Fett himself. Delta 62 ""Scorch"" is the squad's demolitions expert and all-round joker. Delta 40 ""Fixer"" is the straight man and computer specialist. And finally, Delta 07 ""Sev"", the sniper and gruesome sadist. The dialogue exchange is worth its weight in gold and because the game's pace is tight and condenced, they don't end up looping up. It gives the whole endeavor a lively character that is a nice offset to the gritty visuals. Still, there are some things you'll have to consider. The game isn't very long; you can tear through it an afternoon. Replaying it wastes some of the surprise moments, but you'll be better at some of the positioning and directions, allowing you to focus on speedrunning for instance. Some gauntlets can also feel extremely cheap at first. Sometimes you'll end up reloading a particular section over and over again because you squad gets wiped within the first 10 seconds. And then there is the ending off course. I'll let you figure that out on your own. I can reccommend this game to anyone who is a Star Wars fan, and to anyone looking for a shooter with exemplary squad AI and gameplay.			"

												Edit 25/11/2016I'm giving SW:RC the Test of time award because out of all of the old games from my childhood I've tried to get back into, I got back into this absolutely no problem. If graphics aren't a dealbreaker to you, try this game, it truly is one of the best Star Wars games ever made, perhaps only second to SW:KotOR.Reasons to get this game. 1. Squad banter2. Detonate explosives3. Awesome breach door manoeuvers4. Great story (short but great)5. Awesome music which fits surprisingly well with the Star Wars universe			"

												In this game, you play as Commando Delta 38 (Boss/Leader).The game follows the story of three missions throughout Delta Squad's career in the Separatist Crisis.From fighting alongside wookies to getting your face drilled by a scavenger droid, you lead your squad to complete objectives your normal, mass produced, counterparts could/cannot.The game and story is nice, I loved it and maybe you will too. This is from the soldier's perspective as to the usual jedi perspective. The game plays pretty damn smooth on PC. I haven't had any real game-breaking problems. The game is old enough to even play on lower-end laptops. You get to actually order your squad to do things (ex.When you issue the Search and Destroy order, they become aggressive and move ahead even if you're looking around, You can order them to set demolition charges on objectives to progress or you could order them to secure the area and plant the demolition charge yourself. You can even send them to sniper/anti-armor positions as well as turrets.)If you lose all your health, you get downed and the game doesn't end until your entire squad is downed. So while you're downed you could either tell them to maintain current orders (ex. search and destroy) or order the closest squad member to revive you. There's also the option to load the last save while you're downed. There's also quicksaves, I hotkeyed mine to F1 and F3 because I can screw things up a lot. I don't think you can really get through this game without ordering your squad around. You take quite a bit of damage, even on medium difficulty. Just for future reference, don't run infront of your squad while they're firing a sniper or a anti-armor grenade. Bad things happen. . .All in all this game was great for it's time and pretty short if you know what you're doing. I just REALLY wish there was a sequal just because of the ending. . .			"

												The moment you boot up Republic Commando is the moment your realize this isn't your usual Star Wars games.Presented in a darker, militaristic tone, you're placed in the shoes of Boss, a freshly manufactured clone, whose the leader of a commando squad of four. The opening epitomizes the message of the game, that you're a soldier and you have to rely on your squad-mates- as a side-note, look up during the short scene on Kimino, that's the attention to detail this game has. The art-style is harsher and the droids have an threating growl to their voices (♥♥♥♥ those whiny voices Lucas went with). It certainly feels unique since it uses its own soundtrack instead of constantly using John Williams pieces as a crutch. Stylistically, the game is beautiful, with a absolutely rocking soundtrack that knows when to throw in those vocals and drum-beats. Graphically, it's a 2005 game and console port, at 60 fps and proper lighting it's better than the original xbox version for sure. However, I believe it's the art-style instead of the textures that carries the visual direction. The actual gameplay harkens back to Rainbow Six with how you use your AI partners to clear levels and focus fire. Some of my favorite aspects of the game are the fact that you can 'prep' for battle. You can order a sniper to sit back or have one of your guys bombard the enemy from grenadier nest. Now you can only do this through context sensitive actions, but it's more a feature of the level design that rewards player thought than a ""you can only proceed after using a laser-designated airstrike on these helpless sand people"".The AI is very compentent too. They will require revival, but that's only on the hardest sections of the game. I never felt like they were idiotic, and actually they keep up with you extremely well. It's no F.E.A.R, but for a squad-based shooter, the AI never failed me on the several play-throughs I've had both past and present.Augmenting this squad is your own weaponry. The standard blaster is honestly a peashooter to me, but you get a mother♥♥♥♥ing shotgun in a Star-wars game, and it is god-damn awesome. The standard blaster can be switched to both a sniper rifle and an anti-tank grenade launcher, allowing to have a total of four weapons (one weapon you can pick up from an enemy soldier) with three types of grenades. You also have a blade-fist, and like Halo, your melee attack is brutal and effective in close-combat. In total, you have a solution for every problem and ammo is given often enough to use all your tools while given sparingly enough to not go willy-nilly with sniper and rpg shots.This game has become one of my favorite Star Wars games mostly because of the characters and story. Your three squad-mates have plenty of memorable quips and though they were stereotypical in their personalities, they give that Star Wars flair that prevents the game from being a super grim-dark slog. I'd never consider them annoying and by the end of the game you really detect how the characters have become more brothers than comrades-at-arms.  Story-wise you get some background information on some of the Clone-war plot-lines from the Prequels. However you never have a moment where it overly masturbates over the prequels' storylines or characters, it plays it straight and the only time you ever see a truly iconic character from Star Wars is once. RC is it's own game and story inside the Star Wars universe and I really admire that. It doesn't need Han Solo or Luke Skywalker to be a Star Wars game. And the aforementioned moment actually comes as a real reward to an honestly disappointing ending. A pat on the back for working through the difficult sections of RC.However I have my misgivings with RC. For one it's short. Not any shorter than an average FPS campaign of today, but at the time it was a very short game. There are only a handful of worlds to go to. Although the finales end with a bang (the Republic Ghostship's final mission has the most badass ending setpiece I've ever seen in a Star Wars game), they aren't extremely varied. You're going to be inside military compounds with only a few examples having open level design (these often have squad-points where you can assign snipers and grenadiers). There will be a few stretches where you have to go down a narrow corridor. Fighting waves of enemies. Ho-humming your way along. It'd be an injustice if I didn't emphasis a 'few' though. Most often the game gives you options and some cool set-piece battles to command through.The game can also be back-breakingly hard at points. I like this, but sometimes you'll get super-bullet spongy enemies (the reason why the main blaster feels ♥♥♥♥♥♥) back to back. The super-battle droids are the worst offenders. We're talking fighting up to six of those ♥♥♥♥ers at once, in a bare-knuckled shoot-out. On harder difficulties, this can make the game undeniably frustrating. Which turns those glorious finales into a sweat-inducing curse-ridden rant.Also no sequel. When you finish this game, you will agree that it ends at the worst moment. It doesn't feel unfinished due to just how badass the ending finale is. I mean there's a stretch that basically deconstructs the entire premise of the game and makes you realize just how important your squad is. But story-wise, you'll have to read a book to ever see the end of the Republic Commando series. And honestly, the book was 'meh' like most video game books.The squad gameplay can be a bit disappointing at times. It's more arcadey than realistic, and sometimes the squadmates are there to just hide how bullet-spongy the enemies are. I'd have liked to be able to always have a guy with his sniper-rifle out rather than them having to setup. I'd also have liked to have the squad mates use grenades more often or engage in melee instead of using those aforementioned blasters. Asking them to switch to shotguns would've been the best damn thing too. But every complaint I have with the game ends with a 'however'. The squad gameplay can be meh, however the way the game uses the squad adds extreme weight to the narrative and tone. The story is abrupt, however it has so many moments in the game that have struck with me for a damn decade. The levels aren't varied, however they really give that ""behind enemy lines blowing up their ♥♥♥♥"" feeling.For $10.00, you get a game that I would mention in the same breath as KotOR 1&2 and Jedi Outcast. It's not just a great Star Wars game, it's a game I would recommend to people that know nothing about the universe. It's a game I would play even if I wasn't in the mood for a Star Wars fix. This was a work of passion for the devs, who used Star Wars as a vehicle to tell a story of cooperation and brotherhood more through the gameplay than cutscenes.EDIT: Some things I forgot to mentioned or worded poorly. For one the AI of the squadmates is competent, but the enemy droids are as dumb as they are in the Prequels. Only the Super Battle Droid or Droideka pose any threat due to their bullet-spongey nature and their constantly attacking AI pattern. An enemy force you encounter later mixes things up, but their use of cover is only so effective and they do have a habit of mixing effective tactics with standing in the open.As a whole though, the enemy variety is noteworthy. Each major faction in the Clone Wars (as were present up to episode III) is represented and has units that are both cannon fodder and those that require squad focus fire. The enemy forces are gradually changed out and each world introducing a new faction that is better than the one before. Better armored, armed, and tactical. You'll never meet a force that can truly match your Commandos, but the array or melee and ranged enemies is remarkable for such a short game. Also, there is multiplayer in RC. Do I play it? Well, once or twice. It's a deathmatch arena game in the style of older shooters. Make of that what you will.			"

Regardless, this game is greatly underrated as its voice cast, graphics and story create a very fun and immersive atmosphere. If you can catch this at $10 or less, it's well worth a playthrough.

Tl'dr version:  One of the best Star Wars games out there. To this day, an underrated and often overlooked part of the evolution of squad based shooters; also included is a fantastic soundtrack.Great, (for the most part) A.I, and likeable squad mates make this short, but engaging ride all the sweeterElaborated version: I often find that people have a tendency to harp on about SW: Battlefront and KOTOR a little bit too much. They were great games, (especially the latter) but I found them to be deeply flawed games. SW: Republic Commando, while flawed in some ways, manages to pull everything together in a much more satisfying way. This is obviously due to it's genre, and the nature of the mission structure. Not a thing is out of place. This comes at price however; the mission structure is disjointed to say the least, and the story is bare bones. However you'll get the feeling this was deliberate, as just like in real combat, and especially if you're a 'slightly less expendable' clone, you'll not be kept up to the date with the war as a whole. The game will take it tacitly that you know the Star Wars lore already and fling references to the films at you without guilt or trepidation. For a avid SW fan this wont be a problem, I unfortunately found myself lost at some points in the dialogue.  The mechanics are just as you expect from a Squad shooter; intuitive, tight, and easy to control. The PC version runs great with a M&C set up, but a controller is also possible. It might be necessary to have button mapping software however, as the games age breaks the controls. You squad mates don't need you to hold their hand, and can perform simple tasks without you needing to give the order. However, they will occasionally rush in a 'no win scenario' and be dropped in matter of seconds under a hail of plasma fire. This will happen to you over and over, and their really is no way to stop it happening. This does have the unintended use of keeping aggro off you, while you attend to other matters. The game features the modern invent system of the FPS. That is to say. You're limited to two normal weapons, 1 special weapon, and multiple attachments to your assault rifle, thus giving the weapon variety a much needed boost. There is a weapon for every scenario. Now, onto the soundtrack. As a avid collector of game Soundtracks, this would have a proud spot on my list. In short; it's fantastic. A mixture of choral, and star wars symphony tropes mixed together to create a chilling, but engaging and epic theme. Definitely worth getting on soundtrack.Finally, onto the negatives, and they are surprisingly few. The game is no looker, and is really showing it's age as of 2015. However, over a decade on and it's vista's are still rather eye catching, especially the later missions on Kashyyyk. Also, while I said the A.I was great; that was for last decade. Now not so much. Your squad mates will get stuck on geometry and regularly fail to revive you, even if their aren't any enemies in the area. This is all forgiven however by the amazing squad dynamic of banter that is constantly being thrown around. Very rarely will you actually care what your objective is, but you'll genuinely like and care for your squad as the game progresses, and you feel like this is a family. Final thoughts: By no means a looker, and to modern audiences this game might feel slightly lost in why this game was so great back in the day, however I still recommend giving it a try if it comes on sale. Everything is here:• Great Combat• Great Characters• Great Soundtrack• Reasonable length.*Be aware however, the MP for the game has been shut down.*			"

												Well  Star Wars Republic Commando is imo one of the best Star Wars games out their....may even be better then Battlefront 2 or Knights of the old republic but damn that's a hard choice. All Star Wars games are awesome. But back to  Star Wars Republic Commando.It is such a badass game. You get to command 3 Squad mates while  battling your way though the galaxy on geonosis,A creepy ♥♥♥ spaceship,(That level still gives me the creeps), and kashyyyk.While at the same time getting a bunch of sweet cool weapons and fighting a bunch of cool enemies. Sadly their isn't any 4 player Co op but i'm pretty sure their is or someone is gonna make a mod for that.(I hope)In general you should buy it. Star Wars fan or not buy it. Like FPS Games? Buy it. Like Star wars? ♥♥♥♥ing Buy it.All in all 10/10 One of the best games ever made imo.			"

												One of the better Star Wars games out there. I despise the prequel trilogy, yet I still found this game to be quite good. It's an FPS where you play as the leader of an elite squad of commandos sent on the toughest of jobs.You can position your squad members, each one is supposedly skilled at different tasks, and it's mostly just blasting your way through droids and bugs in caverns, facilities, and space ships. You get the typical weapons--shotguns, pistols, sniper, rifle, etc. mostly in star-wars-style laser blasting form. It's about ten hours long, and it's a pretty good campaign with some neat set-pieces. The squad members have some fun personalities and the voice work is solid. Since it's an older game, there are no iron sights, so that might be hard to get used to. The graphics hold up well, although I do believe it lacks widescreen. There are some compatibility issues, so you might need to take a look at the forums if you run into problems.			"

												On the timeline of great FPS games, Republic Commando sadly lurks in the shadow of the classics, but outdoes them in many respects. This Metroid Prime-inspired and slightly darker take on the Star Wars mythos puts you right in the shoes of a squad of covert Republic infiltrators carrying out a series of increasingly tense missions in tightly designed levels. A cohesive package of sound, graphics, and story that coalesce to form one of the ofter overlooked masterpieces of the genre.			"

												What a shooter. Other than a little short, I can't see anything bad to say about this. Maybe a bit too much of lonely time, but it makes up in other areas. A brilliant mix of just a bit of Rainbow Six and a lot of Halo, but in the Star Wars universe. There is something that I can't put my finger on, but at least for me it works quite nicely. Either that or the famous Nostalgia Goggles.			"

												EA, Disney, and LucasArts could quite literally make 100 million dollars by releasing a sequel for this game.Unfortunately, they're too busy releasing a washed out version of Battlefront.Updated 13.10.2015Like i thought, after playing the Battlefront Beta it's now clear that the game is absolute garbage. It's boring, cookie cutter shooter where you just spawn, run forward, kill everything you see and repeat. It might be ""fun"" for the first 30 minutes but after that you'll probably get bored and move to some other more mechanically interesting title. There are also dramatically less features than in the original two games, it was also announced today that they are going to be releasing a 50€ Season Pass for the game which will provide early access to future content for buyers etc.Now, business practices like this are terrible for the gaming industry. There is absolutely no way you can defend it without sounding like a sheep. Then again, i probably wouldn't be too ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about it if they actually released even half of the content that was already introduced in the Battlefront games more than 10 years ago.So, getting back to Republic Commando. It's still a great game, instead of buying Battlefront get this game instead. You certainly won't waste your money that way.			"

												No nonserious review this time, I can't think of anything.And here's my little info thing. Star Wars: Republic Commando is a tactical first-person shooter taking place in the prequel trilogy, or the Rise of the Empire Era, during a period of three to four years known as The Clone Wars, which is infact, my favorite part of Star Wars. Yes, get mad at me for liking the prequels. You play as Boss, a clone commando who leads Delta Squad, a squad of commandoes. There is Scorch, the explosives expert, Fixer, what you could call a hacker I guess, and Sev, the sniper.Time for the review part.Pros:+ First off, THE MUSIC. It's amazing!+ The graphics are quite good.+ The gameplay is decent, better than some other first person shooters.+ It has a good storyline, even though it's short. + Good voice acting+The characters are good. Cons:- Widescreen support has to be edited in.- Campaign is short.- Cliffhanger ending.Star Wars fan? Pick it up!Get's a 9/10 from me!			"

												Best FPS for Star Wars.Screw EA.Screw the new Battlefront.Play this game over and over.GG.In all seriousness, this game is a must buy for any Star Wars fan, even if you don't like the Clone Wars or the prequel movies. It's 1000x better than the new Battlefront game.You control Delta squad, a group of four clone commandos, Delta Sev, Delta Scorch, Delta Fixer, and you, Delta Boss, the leader of the squad. You fight your way through battledroids, super battledroids, droidekas, spider droids, flyings things that try to suck on your head, Magna Guards, Geonosians, and even lizards. It's true, the campaign is fairly short and multiplayer doesn't work anymore, but guess what. Those 9 ish hours were the best 9 hours of my life! I recommend this game 100%.

												I absolutely love this game! It shows how awesome the Clone Commandos are and is great because there are absolutely no Jedi! I'd like to say real quickly that if you want this game and are leery because it says 'blood and gore,' don't be worried. There is a little blood, but not much (most of it is green alien blood); and the 'gore' is nothing to worry about. There is also just a bit of language as well. The campaigns are great! I love the weaponry options in the game, and the commands you give the Commandos are easy to use and understand. For being an 11-year-old game, IT IS FREAKIN' AWESOME! Last note about the game: The multiplayer does not work because the company that hosts the server shut down a few years ago.			"

												I remember playing this game way back on the original Xbox. It's not through rose-colored glasses that I say this is the greatest squad-based shooter I've ever played.Let's start with the atmosphere. It's spot on. Any casual Star Wars fan will recognize most of the enemies and locations. The level and character designs are grittier than what you see in the movies, and that fits the tone perfectly. The HUD is one of the best I've ever seen, because YOU SEE THE BORDERS OF YOUR HELMET! Such a simple design choice affects your immersion immensely.So everything around you is cool. What about the combat? This game FEELS great. The modular weapons system is genius.  The squad commands are easy to learn but hard to master. The difficulty is pleasantly challenging; don't expect yourself to be repeating tons of levels, but do expect to be constantly searching for health and ammo. The weapons feel rewarding to use, and above all, the squad-based combat is amazing. You FEEL bad-♥♥♥. You FEEL like it's you four protagonists against the world. And you WANT to take 'em all on.Your three Clone Commando compatriots, Scorch, Fixer, and Sev, are exceptional AI companions (especially for 2005). They are effective in combat, respond to commands instantly, and generally don't make the kind of dumb decisions that make you rage at AI companions. They don't talk much, but you can still feel personality emanating from them.On the note of character, the one category where this game falters is story. You know where you are, and you know why. You have objectives. But that's about it. The characters don't change over time. There are no plot twists. There is an instance of tragic loss (I won't spoil it for you), and it hits you hard. But there is room for improvement in that area.Besides the story, what other improvements could be made? I won't comment on the graphics, because this game is coming up on 10 years old, but I will say they've aged well. The only thing that springs to mind is the level design. Don't get me wrong, the levels are designed fine, but it gives away what's to come. When you see a spot where you can issue a sniping command, you know there's enemies directly ahead. Health and ammo are always located directly behind large groups of enemies. It's textbook old-fashioned level design, but you always know what's coming.One final point: because this is an older game, a 1920x1080 aspect ratio is not an option it offers. It's a minor detail, but an important one.In conclusion, ten years later, this is still an incredible game. Although the story is never going to be a selling point, everything else about this game is great. It feels like you're taking a first-person trip through the summer action film spectacular that Star Wars never had. I highly recommend it to anyone who puts gameplay ahead of graphics. Amongst the vast troves of LucasArts treasures, this gem certainly shines bright.			"

												Yes, the first few missions may be dull: Slice this, snipe that and so on. But that isn't the point. The point is, you need to work as a team. Sure, I may be a Star Wars fan myself but this doesn't affect my opinion on this fantasic game. To the people who say the graphics make up the game entirely, just do yourself a favour and don't play a single game for the rest of your life. Sure, the graphics in this game aren't up to scratch with today's standards but they sure were back in the good days of 2005. To be honest, I think they're great! The gameplay and story line is simply amazing. It brings you back to Geonosis, Kashyyk, an abandoned Republic Cruiser and a few other places. I don't think there is another Commando game out there that is based on Star Wars. But if there is, this has got to be one of the best around. I spent heaps of time playing Star Wars Battlefront 1 & 2 and let me tell you, those are amazing games too. The squad that you play with is also very responsive and helpful (unlike in many other games). They'll do what you tell them to do. No questions asked. Unless they are under heavy fire and it is protocol-wise required to defeat the enemy first (goddammit just revive me already haha). Scorch really does keep the squad alive with his 'jokes', athough he can say it the wrong times.But too bad Lucas Arts and Pandemic have left the Star Wars games, they were doing a fantastic job. Anyway, overall this is a fantastic game and I hope it won't be forgotten. If you are looking for a multiplayer, try going to Star Wars Battlefront 2. That is also an amazing game. I'll give it 9.5/10. Buy it already if you haven't! Have fun! :)			"

This is one of the finest Star Wars games as well as one of the best FPS shooters of its time; heck, it's 2016 and it's still mindblowing how much of a quality game Republic Commando is.My only wish for this game is for it to be remastered. Take whatever DICE did with graphics and sound for BATTLEFRONT and apply it to this game, add up to 4 player co-op and reboot the servers for multiplayer skirmishes, add a couple of extra gamemodes like wave survival and extraction and I can guarantee that it would sell like hotcakes.

												After completing this game I can gladly say that this is a game that needs a sequel.This game follows Delta Squad. You are the leader, Delta-38 Boss. Your squad consists of Delta-07 Sev, Delta-40 Fixer, and Delta-62 Scorch. The chemistry between these characters is unlike any other game I have seen.  Sev is the most badass Clone I have ever seen. Scorch is a querky, funny joker. Fixer is a very self centered man. He has basically no personality besides a few funny quotes here and there. This game is very short. It consists of 3 ""Chapters"". Geonosis, RAS Prosecutor, and Kashyyyk. In all I rate this game 9/10. The game's story is very good, the only thing I can find bad about this game is that the firefights can sometimes be very bland and boring.			"

												Ever thought Rainbow Six getting into Star Wars? Well here it is. A very fun and rather short game perfectly fitting into the Star Wars Universe. Your team, Delta, is formed by 4 RC clone commandos:-1138 (Boss, squad-leader, that is You)-1262 (Scorch, demolitions)-1207 (Sev, sniper)-1140 (Fixer, tech expert)It is rather great to give individual orders to this team simulating a spec op team behind enemy lines into a Star Wars universe. This feature gives the game uniqueness. For this reason I do recommend it to anyone who loves Star Wars.Thanks for reading.			"

												Don't let my hours fool you, I've completed this game nearly 3 times over. This game is frankly one of the greatest Star Wars games out there. Republic Commando puts you in the boots of (you guessed it) a clone commando, with 3 squadmates. You travel to locations like Geonosis, Kashyyyk, and an abandoned Republic ship. This game focuses on squadwork, while you or another squadmate is arming a charge to get into a locked door, the other 3 are stopping the super battle droid shooting at you (which are actually kinda intimidating in this game). This is an older game, but you will still be impressed with the graphics to a degree, and at the not-as-expensive-as-98%-of-all-fps-shooters-out-there price of $10, I believe that this quality game is well worth your money!

Amazing game-play and squad controls plus an immersive world create a memorable campaign leaving you longing for more. The worlds and characters you meet along the way are varied. Enemies have distinct faults you can exploit to defeat them. Voice acting and level design are both fantastic and add to the great campaign. Your squad has AI way ahead of its time and for once you don't grow tired of them. Instead you develop a weird sense of attachment to each of their unique personalities. Beyond being my favorite single player game it was also my go to for multiplayer* in which it molded arena combat and amazing maps to create a fantastic experience.*multiplayer servers are down and there are many issues when trying to bypass that with the steam version.Pros:Game-playVoice acting immersionSquadCharactersWorld/lvl designenemiesplotCons:Servers for multiplayer are down9.75/10			"

The character designs, the hud, all the effects are very well made gun designs. Everything was designed so well that you could nearly touch that feeling of how to be a Republic Commando.+Soundwork: The whole SW franchise is famous for great sound work in every single game, this game is no exception.+Gameplay: And now to the best part -this game offers a unique experience - how does it feel to be a part of the Clone Squad, amazing AI of your clone friends, different roles of each person, command each of your team members and its really easy to control them, so it's a pleasure to play even with bots, and on top of that you had+Multiplayer: So you can squad up with your friends for the Republic glory.All the characters feel so alive, I couldn't get enough of this game back in 10 years ago.

												This game has been one of my favorite games since it came out over a decade ago. Without a doubt it still holds it's own in this gaming generation. There are no force powers, and no jedi lightsaber battles. This is all about a badass clone commando squad, the experience is unique and awesome. It deserves a sequel.			"

												So, ive been a gamer all my life especially with FPS games, I started with halo in 2000, and moved to Call of duty, with the occasional Battlfield, in all my 20 YEARS of gaming, there has been no other first person shooter that has touched me the same way PERIOD. The story is compelling, deep and emotional having you go through real struggles. The gameplay is fluid, and smooth, better than any other first person shooter, and ive played : Halo 1 through 4, Call of duty : 1 through 4 Modern warfare 1 through 3 Battlefield 1942, 2142, battlefield 2, 3. This game TRUMPS THEM ALL. Commanding the commandos is easy to understand and simple without interrupting the gameplay flow. The amount of weapons is a comfortable amount that give you versatility without bogging you down. The commandos are like real people with thier commentary and feedback! Its also actually difficult, you dont regenerate health, the enemies are harder but not unfair, you dont get unrealistic amounts of ammo, and the scenarios are down to earth and feel like solid military situations that could come up. I cant rate this game high enough it holds the top 3 star wars games ive ever played. P.S its not 3rd i just couldnt pick a number 1 haha. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game you wont regret it.			"

												This game may be old, as it was made over 10 years ago (2005), but, it still is today my all time favourite FPS and Star Wars game. This game puts you into the feet of an elite republic commando squad leader, only by the name of 'Boss: 38' (Voiced by the same person who voiced Jango Fett). He has three other clones in his squad, 'Sev: 07' (The Sniper), 'Fixer: 40' (The Hacker) and last but  deffinitly not least 'Scorch: 62' (The Demolishion, and my favourite clone in the game), who all take place in 'Delta Sqaud'. Campaign is FANTASTIC, AWESOME storyline, with amazing characters. Unfortunatly, multiplayer no longer works, but you can still system link with ur friends and enjoy tring to kill each other.All in all, this is an amazing game, I 100% recomand this game to all of you, AND IT'S ONLY $10. 11/10: BEST GAME EVER (or at least in my opinion) 100% GET THIS GAME, NOW, OR I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN IN MY RREPUBLIC COMMANDO OUTFIT AND KILL YOU, ok maybe that went to far, but stil, GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ""JUST DO IT!!!!!!!""Thanks for reading and I hope you get this game.Kind Regards: TouchTheRazor			"

												This game hold a unique place amongst the Star Wars games. There are no lightsabers, you don't have the force, you only have Delta Squad. The gunplay is fun, the gameplay is very interesting and challenging, and the AI is actually decent. In Republic Commando your squad of Commandos are not just fodder to absorb fire for you. They are good at killing, they can be deployed into a variety of tactical positions and be given a variety of orders, they get hurt, and they can be taken down. In the event you are taken down, they can actually help you up, which is pretty impressive. Another difference this game has from other Star Wars games is it's decidedly darker tone, as you aren't hanging out in the nicest of places. After all, you are a soldier and you are definitely in the ♥♥♥♥.I cannot reccomend this game enough to fans of both Star Wars and FPS games.			"

												when i was 9 years old i saw this game while browsing on youtube and i really  wanted to play it but i didnt have a steam account so i couldnt really figure out how to play it, a few months ago i saw the game on sale and i decided to buy it just for the nostalgic childhood moments. I didnt expect the game to be fantastic, just a standard game with bad graphics because it was developed in 2005. But when i played the game i was really surprised, i didn't expect the game to be so good, when you look at it; the graphics are actually very good for a 2005 game, the story is amazing and the gameplay is very enjoyable. Because of the variety of different weapons there are options of playstyles for each individual person. and the ability to remotely control your teammates is very nice too, i just wish there was a sequel or a remake kind of thing, i would be very happy to see this game remade with modern day technology.

												For coming out in 2005 this game still is a thrill to go back and relive the ultimate Clone Special Ops experience. You will be tasked with dealing with the most elite and discreet Republic operations, and leading a group of 4 (including yourself) elite Clone soldiers called Commandos. To begin, the gameplay is really good for a 2005 game. The shooting action gets really intense in the latter part of the game, and you will have to learn how to manage your squads survival as well as your own. Get too caught up in keeping your squad fit, and your own health will fall and you will go unconscious. Focus too much on your own health and equipment, and your squad will be left without orders and ultimately end up dying. This ends up being a gameplay goal for you as you must balance the two in order to have a successful playthrough (unless you want to play on the easiest difficulty). Although this does end up becoming a problem when your squad completely goes against their own common sense and runs out into a crowd of a bunch of droids, guns blazing, and gets shot down within seconds. Your squad also tends to run in front of you as you're throwing a grenade, which is super annoying because it will take down your shields and your health, as well as your squad member's, and you will still have enemies firing at you. I also feel the game is a little bit too difficult as you will find yourself screaming at your monitor on the Normal difficulty setting. Perhaps the developers could have balanced the difficulties by adding a fourth one (easy would still be easy, add a normal, normal would be hard, and hard would be very hard). But still, the game is still enjoyable despite the setbacks of a few gameplay issues. The guns are also nice. Most of them have decent sounds (other ones being laughable), and they have a good difference in purpose and power. The grenades, with the exception of the flash-bang grenade, are all pretty useful. Although none stand out above the other in the department of usefulness as they're all pretty much the same: aim at your enemy and throw. But still, they're a decent touch.The presentation is at an average level. With your standard graphics card you can max this game out, and the visuals won't look too bad. The textures are decent, and you won't really see any frame rate drop or texture pop-ins. The game overall has excellent environments that all differ from each other drastically. You'll go from fighting on the sandy and rocky world of Geonosis to the ""abandoned"" Republic ship in a matter of hours. With the varied environments and average graphics with no presentation technical difficulties, I can confidentially saw this game has above par presentation given its age.Now, onto the fun part, the content of Star Wars Republic Commando. First off, the story is really good. You are placed in command of Delta Squad, an elite group of Republic Commandos, which essentially are just Clone super soldiers. You will be given a variety of missions ranging from destroying a Droid Factory to helping the leader of the Wookies on Kashyyyk. Along the way you will unlock a few extras, which aren't really anything special, but they're a decent addition. The game is honestly too short. With the edition of another planet this game would have easily felt more complete. But the content that is there is fun and replayable, so it doesn't diminish the game too much. The multiplayer is remotely enjoyable, but will get old quickly. The community is either dead silent or a bunch of snotty veterans who trash talk new players and exploit the more powerful weapons. The maps themselves aren't anything out of the box, and quite bland, which is a shame considering the variety and design of the campaign maps were quite well. You'll most likely end up playing the campaign 1 or 2 times and maybe the multiplayer an hour or two (unless you find the multiplayer really fun, which I doubt most will).All in all I can say this game was a very good addition to the Star Wars franchise. Although it is a little short and has some gameplay issues and a below par multiplayer, you will find yourself thoroughly enjoying the amazing campaign and its awesome storytelling, environments, and characters. For the current price of $9.99 you should definitely pick this game up and relive or enjoy for the first time one of the greatest Star Wars gaming experiences you can possibly find.			"

												Republic Commando is a FANTASTIC game, one of the greatest Star Wars games ever made and unquestionably the best Star Wars first-person shooter ever made (I do not count Jedi Outcast or Jedi Academy, because the lightsabers kind of radically change those games to the point where they no longer really qualify). The squad AI is still incredibly good by today's standards, the characters are compelling and smartly-written, and the environments and story are original and creative.But I cannot openly recommend getting this on Steam without some qualifying statements.Republic Commando is an old game. A very old game. And it does not play nicely with newer computers. Problems with bumpmapping in the graphics can result in crashes, and trying to get it to run on a 64-bit Windows OS is a horrific struggle. If you have Windows 7 or 8 64-bit, Republic Commando may need to be sadly relegated to the history books. Hopefully your memories, if you got a chance to play it back in the day. You will likely not get another.EDIT: Ever since I upgraded to Windows 10, it's worked perfectly. I don't know what changed, but I hereby retract the preceding paragraph. In the interests of transparency, I will leave it up, but the compatibility issues probably won't affect you anymore.			"

												This may seem like an exaggeration, but Star Wars: Republic Commando may be the best game I've ever played. I am a huge Star Wars fan, and I actually found out about this game from the  tie-in novels [www.amazon.com]. I bought this game during a sale and mostly left it alone until recently. Now, after playing it for a few hours, I can confirm that it is everything that its small but fanatic cult following says it is.This depiction of the Star Wars universe is much darker than any other I've encountered before. Rather than following the heroic Jedi in an unrealistic ""good vs evil"" fight, Republic Commandos occupy that ""gray area"" and win their fights through brutal efficiency. In fact, Jedi don't even play a significant role in this game. Also, rather than showing typical sanitized Star Wars death (no blood), gratuitous amounts of gore frequently splatters the player's helmet (yay), which is eventually cleaned by a nifty windshield wiper-like device.Gameplay is heavily centered around a squad of four, where the leader is controlled by the player. Commands are given to the other three soldiers, consisting of a sniper, a demolitions expert, and a hacker. AI teammates are actually useful in this game without making it too easy for the player (take notes, Overkill). Each member can be told to perform certain tasks, such as manning a turret, blowing a door open, or providing sniper fire. Everything feels seamless and well-executed, especially the  door breach maneuver . #SquadGoalsGraphics are, well, 2005. Can't expect much. The resolution doesn't even go to 1080p. Thankfully, there are mods to fix that. They're good enough to create a reasonably immersive environment, but I'd like to think that it's the story and gameplay that makes this game what it is. The soundtrack fills in the rest of the atmosphere, which is a combination of John Williams glory and some original compositions. Good music is pretty much a given for anything Star Wars related.About the story (SPOILERS AHEAD): I haven't played through the entire game yet, but I've played enough and have read enough of the novels to get a sense of what's going on.Late in the game, one of the commandos, RC-1207 or ""Sev"", is left behind on the planet of Kashyyyk following a botched extraction. The game then ends on a cliffhanger regarding the fate of Sev. The game then ends on that cliffhanger. In the novel, Sev's former drill sergeant and father figure Kal Skirata then embarks on a long journey to find him. Unfortunately, thanks to LucasArts getting really messed up and its transition to Disney, both the sequel to this game and the sequel to  Imperial Commando [www.amazon.com] were cancelled. There have been rumors that  EA will release a sequel [www.technobuffalo.com] and that  Sev is alive [www.polygon.com]. However, they are only rumors that we can only hope are true. TL;DR: Underrated squad-based first person shooter with great mechanics and story. Give sequel pls			"

The game features unique squad commands that you can give to your squad members who are not operating on a stupid AI but actually good decision making that could make you recover from a stupid down and allows you finish the mission. The story is amazing, the atmosphere is superb, the graphics are a bit outdated but for a game that came out  in 2005 it still has lovely graphics. I can recommend this game to any Star Wars fan especially the ones who have interest in the Clone Wars era			"

My dad bought me this when it came out cuz I played the demo on one of the Star Wars movies. This game was incredible. What do you get:Better squad interaction than 90% of games today with better personalities too. Solid shooting with an adaptive weapon system and enjoyable weapon pick ups from enemies. Level design is fun and in some places the tension is extremely high as blaster fire is pounding off your cover. You feel like a real commando going against brutal odds and sabotaging enemy lines. And an ending that will make you yell at your screen in a good way, none of that cliffhanger insert sequel here nonsense.			"

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: You join up with the Delta Squad, an elite group of clones whom have been cloned from the Mandalorian Bounty Hunter Jango Fett. They were also hand picked by Jango Fett to become commando's. The Delta Squad batch of clones were all raised in the same pod group, they're actually one of the closest knit clone groups.Okay PAUSE the review... I personally already had a vested interest in this game because I've read several of the Author Karen Traviss' Republic Commando Books. While Disney (and George Lucas) no longer accepts these books as cannon... ...Don't get me started, I'm just going to accept it and move on.I still prefer the ties between the series. That said, there's a lot of additional character development given to the Delta Squad from her books. Honestly the Nulls are way better, ORDO ALL THE WAY BABY! ..but I digress.

The four Delta Characters are RC-1140 (Fixer), RC-1207 (Sev), and RC-1262 (Scorch) and you play as RC-1138 (Boss). Here's another reason to respect the game developers, the voice actor for Boss is the actual actor for Jango Fett himself: Temuera Morrison.(However each clone should have his voice, but the game developers gave all of the clones voiced different voice actors... Lets just pretend this is how they hear each other differently, because in Karen Traviss' Books they knew the difference between eachothers voices, but it was only clones and people who got to know them on a personal level would notice the subtle differences. ....aaaaaand it would be very difficult for a gamer to notice difference between the clones voices, let alone instructing a voice actor to change their voice just enough to be different.... BAH. It's complicated, just know I thought about it and attempted to explain it.)Anyway, to recap with less words: Republic Commando story on it's own is kind of shallow because there's very little character development. HOWEVER if you go read the Republic Commando Book series from Karen Traviss then you'll have a whole new level of appreciation for each of these clones.Multiplayer:Just a quick note about the multiplayer, it's gone. Since Gamespy was shut down the servers aren't there. There might still be communities and mod's which you can use to play it with other people though.Gameplay: Before I jump right in and explain the gameplay, lets fix something real quick. When you boot the game the resolution will probably be all wrong, and your mouse will probably be traveling lightspeed all over the screen if you full screen it (ALT + Enter)This guide helped me fix it.Basically you want to open your console mode with your Tilda key: ~ and then type in:setres 1920x1200setmousesensitivity 0.5Even then my mouse moved super fast, and would just use arrow keys to navigate menu's... but it makes the game much more playable. (Final side note: you need to join a game before you can get into the console commands, you can start a LAN game, or jump into a single player campaign game)You have all of the features of a standard FPS in this game, fire, zoom, crouch. The buttons are a wee bit weird at times, like you zoom with Z, and you throw grenades with your right mouse button throws a grenade. (Yeah, that was an unpleasant discovery. I was looking at a wall when I did that.)You Can jump too... but you really won't use that, you also can't sprint... it's the reverse, if you hit shift you move slower. Both of those were weird design choices, but I'm just going to blame it on being the 2000's when this game came out. We're probably lucky it turned out as well as it did.I think it's pretty safe to say most people have played FPS before, and so you come to expect easy and medium difficulties to be relatively challengeless and the only real challenge come from hard mode onward... This is not the case for Republic Commando, I played on medium difficulty (I didn't notice you could change the difficulty until I was half way through, and there's no way I'm switching difficulty half way through a game. Forget that noise.)Most of the challenge in this game comes from the team-oriented gameplay and game design. I normally exploited the AI's design, and let my team mates be cannon fodder while I set bombs, or knifed battle droids in the back of their armor plates... but even with that advantage the game can be down right brutally difficult. Especially if you run out of ammo! Which happened more frequently then I'd like to admit. (I became very well antiquated with the melee button... which is E by the way)


Campaign Mission Selection Map. It averages about 5 levels per planet/ship. For a total game time of 10 hours, that's pretty decent.

There's about 5 levels on each world, I took roughly 10 hours to play through the whole game, and in my opinion hearing the song ""Vode An"" and a few Mando'a words and curses was definitely worth the price of admission for me.Conclusion: I really enjoyed my time spent with Republic Commando, unfortunately I'm disappointed there wasn't really any character development, the controls were awkward at times, and the technical problems you're bound to have with older titles.I was very pleased with the Mando'a tribe, the cutscenes, and the effort given to small details which Fandalorians will definitely pick up on and after hearing Vode An I realized I have a new ringtone for my phone.I hate to say it, but I don't think Republic Commando will appeal to everyone equally. But that being said anyone who enjoyed the clone wars era of star wars, and especially anyone who has read Karen Traviss' books should totally check this game out.Oya Manda!			"

												This game is so good. It runs well on my potato while looking alright, the gameplay is great, the sound is awesome. The only bad point is the occasional clunkyness of the menu system, and the requirement to change hex values in the engine to get 1920x1080 display.			"

												Tinkering might be needed.I needed to set ""bump"" setting in the video option to low. Then I could set everything else to highest.  Otherwise it would crash (Found this inf. on the internets).So now that I am 90 minutes into it I can see why everyone loved this game. Its a solid FPS. The guns are not great but the action is exciting, the voice acting is sooo much better than today's crappy FPS games. The music is awesome.  Your NPC buddies are kick **s. The world is simple old lo res but full of atmosphere.  It's smooth.  I'm enjoying it... It's supposed to be about 10 hours which is fine with me. It's too dated for me to put more then 10 hours into it. But it's more then worth a $1 per hour.  For instance, I managed to enjoy shadow of mordor (at least the killing chieftans) because of cutting edge animations and fun high res combat ** DESPITE the horrible  generic characters, awful forgettable plot lines, dreary music,  and repetitive environments. This game you will get as muchvalue for your money. The combat animations suck and the shooting is not the greatest(but it's OK - and there is some tactical parts) but the GAME as a whole is well conceived and extremely well executed. It's better than the AAA titles of the modern era. **I know Mordor is not a FPS so the comparison is not 1:1 but it's the last game I played and the most ""new"" and slickest game to have been released so I'm just comparing value and I'm making a case for trying out this dated title.

It is an awesome and excellent First-Person Shooter game for being made in 2005!			"

												This is by far one of the best classic Star Wars games you can buy. It's got that old school shooter feel to it with a great story behind it. I definitely reccomend this if you've considered buying some older games. It can definitely be a real challenge depending on the difficulty level you choose. But be warned!

												Finally, some external marketing of Star Wars that does the franchise perfect justice.This game may be older, but it's one of the greatest and still relevant shooters I've played today.Tired of the jedis? Or massive Battlefront-style unit management? Take control of Delta Squad: an elite group of clones who all have their own specialties to bring to the team, and personalities that play well off one another in the amsuing dialouge.The shooting feels pretty good. Enemies die in a lot of visually pleasing and hilarious ways, keeping the good cartoon/serious balance Star Wars is known for. While there's a dissapointing variety of guns, the ones you have suit you very well.As Delta Squad's leader, you take advantage of ""squad commands"". Split up your three squad members to take up sniper positions, heal themselves, hack consoles, breach doors, blow things up, and a variety of helpful things. All these commands are administered and canceled with suprising ease, and the AI is FANTASTIC at fending for themselves and executing orders.Almost shameful to say that your team AI is better than most cooperative shooter-style games on the market today.You only play through three worlds. While the game isn't longer than eight or so hours, it's one long thrill-ride that is action packed with appropriate breathing room. Nothing's more intense than when you're the last of your squad not incapacitated and there's a pod dispensing Super Battle Droids infront of you.There's multiplayer. It's standard deathmatch and CTF type gamemodes. It's nothing special and nobody really plays it anymore.TL;DR?FANTASTIC shooter, very unique, BLEEDS Star Wars atmosphere, entertaining and likable characterss, and holds up as one of the greatest shooters and Star Wars games today. What's not to like?			"

												One the best Star Wars games I have ever played.Let's expand this:The game holds up very well even today. Superb voice acting, epic set pieces, pulse pounding action, it does it all very well. Some games have bad pacing, feel like corridor shooters, or don't do the shooting mechanics very well, but this game manages to avoid those problems. SWRC doesn't have a huge arsenal, but the weapons feel good to use. The main characters are also very endearing.			"

												Even as an old game, it's simply brilliant and brilliantly simple.Even on the easiest difficulty, it's extremely difficult.Republic Commando takes place during my favorite point in Star Wars history, the Clone Wars, and provides an interesting story that provides a few layers of depth to the Grand Army of the Republic. Unlike most shooters, such as Battlefield and Child Online Daycare, your weapon isn't the strongest thing you have (in fact, it's kind of weak sometimes) - it's your squad. When presented with seemingly-unstoppable enemies such as droidekas and super battle droids, you'll need every single rifle aimed at the target. You cannot just blitz through the levels, like you can in most games. It requires a lot of skill and coordination, that both add up to make Republic Commando a very challenging game,  but also a really fun one.			"

												In my opinion Star Wars Republic Commando has to be one of the best first-person shooters made to date. This is because:1. The combat feels great! running at a group of droids firing away at you with just the right amount of accuracy to be a threat and then dispatching them one by one with your wristblade is one of the best experiences in gaming!2. The Team. Your team is made up of 4 people (no spoilers, as you find this all out in the opening) you, the elite Delta 38, the sniper Sev (Delta 07), the hot headed demolitions expert scorch (Delta 62), and the trustworthy commando fixer (Delta 40). Your command over them is relatively limited as you only have 4 options, Search and destroy, Form up, Stay here and Do thing (sniper point, grenade point, breach door, hack, etc) Also if you ""die"" your squad will carry on fighting until finished and then will revive you with half health (you can order them to revive you sooner but that often puts them in a very vulnerable spot).3.The environments, without spoiling the game for you the envoronments range from full on battles with other troopers present to creepy environments with your enemies lurking around every other corner.4. The story. The story really attaches you mentally to your squad and by the end you'll be scolding scorch for shooting you in the back rather than cursing the AI, and there are some real moments of accomplishment in the story such as the end of the first ""chapter"". The ending is awesome too!.So to sum up, GO BUY THIS GAME!			"

												Republic Commando is a very good game, though due to the multiplayer servers being shut down your pretty much paying for a 8-10 hour campagin. (Hamachi, Gameranger, and Orgin can be used to play multiplayer but I am unaware of how much people play)This is currently the only Tactical Star Wars shooter to date so compared to other Star Wars shooters out there it is very good and refreshing for me.Pros: Very good AI teammates.Good ways to make use of the enviroment tactically. The health system is nice, not too easy like regeneration nor not too hard like health pickups.Great Variety of enemies, Super Battle Droids fight like a super battle droid would. They get a bonus for making standard battle droids look somewhat more menecing.Intresting Story.Gun Fights feel like real tactical gun fights.Realistic Door Breaching and squad teamwork.Cons:The design of the Commandos is odd for me, they look too ""super human"" if you will.The campagin is only 8-10 hours and it is really the only thing your getting.Trandoshon weapons resemble real world gunpowder firearms way too much for my liking.Despite being short the way the levels of the campagin are designed makes you feel like your grinding in some areas.For those wondering...IS THIS GAME'S STORY CANON? (SPOILERS)For the most part no, anything that was not the Movies or the Clone Wars animated series were never really canon and they everything that was not the movies or the clone wars series were offically decanonized by Lucasfilm after the company got sold. IS THE CHARACTERS, WEAPONS, AND OTHER ELEMENTS CANON?Some things yes, Delta Squad made an apperance in the Clone Wars animated series thus making them canon. The Trandoshon Shotgun also made an appearance in the Clone Wars along with it being in a EA's Star Wars Battlefront DLC named the ""scatter gun"" (loved using it in both games)Other things no, The follow up to Battle of Kashyyyk does not line up with how it happend in Revenge of the Sith (this was made prior to the movie so that is understandable)General Grevious resembles the 2003 cartoon so i'd assume if he had any lines in this he would sound like he did in that series thus making his role in this game non canon by default.In canon the Trandoshons do in fact use regular blasters and when their shotgun made an appearance in the Clone Wars it did not eject any shells.

												I can't get over how stunningly well this game holds up to the test of time.  I used to game away at Republic Commando when I was but a wee lad, though I never finished it because of that timed level at the end of the first act (let me just get it out of the way, that's probably the biggest doozy in this game).  I've since come back and completed it, but as a child, whoo, was that level rough.  If you can get past an occasional sharp difficulty curve through impressive strategy or dogged pursuit of your goals, you'll find this to be one of the most rewarding experiences you've ever had in a shooter.  It's polished, impressive, tense at parts, and will thrill you despite the limited mechanics.In summary, singlehandedly one of the greatest shooters I've ever played.			"

												This is my all time favorite star wars game. Being able to play not just a clone soldier but a clone with a story. In the game you get to see the front lines in a whole new way. This isnt battle front where once you die your just respawned as a new clone and thrown on the battle field. In this game you have a team and you have to keep them moving along just as you must move along. It reminds me of a mix between the first Halo game and rainbow six vegas. All in all I love it and wish that a second were made.			"

												Alright, this game is AWESOME.  Star Wars Republic Commando is an FPS based on the lives of Delta Squad, 4 elite clone commandos who are sent on the most dangerous and imperative missions the republic has to offer.  Each one has his own distinct personality and all 4 of them (you play as squad leader) are pretty likable characters.  Here are the commandos in order:38 ""three-eight"" aka ""Boss"" or ""Sir""- the squad leader and the player character. He is fully voiced by Temuera Morrison, the voice actor for Boba and Jango Fett in the films.  38 (said literally ""three-eight"")  is a no nonsense commander with a head for strategy and a dry sense of humor.  He leads the squad (obviously) and is able to issue orders to the other 3 commandos, for example, he can tell them to set up sniper positions, anti armor, mount turrets, use healing stations, etc.  (btw these are actual game mechanics, issueing orders to your squad is a huge part of the game).  He has all the weapons that the other 3 commandos are capable of wielding but unlike the others he is capable of using special, enemy weapons that can be found off certain foes.  40 ""four-oh"" aka ""Fixer""- Fixer is the tech specialist of the squad and specialises in hacking and computer interfaces, he is very useful for hacking terminals.  While all the commandos have the same skills and abilities, some are better than others at certain things.  For example, Fixer can hack faster than the others, Scorch is more accurate with grenades and can set explosives faster and Sev is a deadeye with a sniper rifle.  Fixer takes his job verrry seriously and doesn't talk about much other than the mission or how to accomplish it, but he does have moments where he loosens up.  Fixer is exceptional at melee combat and dispatches melee using foes with ease.  62 ""six-two"" aka ""Scorch""-  Scorch is the squad demolitionist and explosive expert and his outlook on life relfects that.  He loves danger and has a very positive, optimistic viewpoint on any sitution, using humor to deal with even the most harrowing of missions.  He is the squad funny guy and his upbeat personality is definitely helpful when things look grim.  Scorch's preferred weapon of choice is the anti-armor grenade launcher and grenades themselves.     07 ""oh-seven"" aka ""Sev""-  Sev is the designated marksman and stealth fighter of the squad and revels in war and battle.  He is a deadly sniper and the best shot in the squad (other than the player).  He is probably the most mandalorian out of the squad and by that I mean he lives for war.  62 finds his fervor for killing to be a bit creepy at times but he is a good soldier and a good friend... and a truly terrible enemy.  Sev's weapon of choice is the sniper rifle, which he uses with pinpoint accuracy.   The game's combat is pretty good and the squad AI is amazing even for today, the commandos feel very human and real.  The game even has multiplayer which I'm not sure if there is anyone on it anymore but it was good in its own way as well.  The story is pretty good and involving and gets pretty hectic at times which keeps things interesting.  All in all this is one of the best star wars games out there and I highly reccomend it for any star wars fan.  I know I spent most of this review talking about the characters, but I did so because they are  the game's strongest attribute.			"

												I know I'm a bit late to the party on this one since the game was released almost 11 years ago as of this review, but this game is actually pretty good for what is. The game is fairly challenging, the AI honestly isn't half-bad, and the overall gameplay is pretty damn good; the music is great, the voice acting is solid, and the game actually looks pretty good for its time. My only real gripes are that the game feels a bit short for the campaign (personal opinion, I just felt that it was a bit shorter than what I expected) and that the ending feels like a bit of a cop-out since it leaves the player feeling as if there's going to be a sequel (which we all know is unfortunately never happening). I'd definitely say something about the multiplayer as well if I could, but since the multiplayer has been rendered non-functional due to GameSpy's shutdown, I'm unfortunately not able to do so.In the end, I'd definitely say that this is a game I'd recommend, even without the multiplayer being functional.

Enemies take a long time to kill and there are lots of times where the game feels like a ""bullet hell"" game because of all the enemies coming at you, but it just adds to the challenge.

 Star Wars, Republic Commando  Note: I have never played multiplayer, (as it was shut down with the exception of GameRanger servers) so I will not be covering it. Star Wars, Republic Commando is a brilliant game. You play as the leader of Delta Squad; an elite squad of four clone commandos, each with their own respective ability (Sniper, Slicer/hacker, etc.) however from memory, it doesn't entire matter whom you order to do what.  Stats Republic Commando Contains: Three different campaign missions, each lasting several hoursA total campaign length of around 10 hours at a moderate paceVery different atmospheres within the respective missionsA canon addition to the Star Wars story line (I believe Disney kept it as canon) Pros Older game, therefore built to be run on toastersOne of very few genuinely good Star Wars gamesWith squad commands, you can order AI to target specific enemies, or preform certain tasks, allowing you to concentrate on a primary objective.A good plot, that gives you another perspective of the clone wars Cons Bad graphics, but the game IS oldAt points, there is some repetition, but the concepts that are repeated are quite good, and do not easily get oldWhile sometimes the game is so hard one will likely have to temporarily lower the difficulty, other times, it is ridiculously easy, and players will not find any challenge in these moments. Overall Rating  8/10  "

												Star Wars Republic Commando is such a unique and addicting game that I find it may even rival the Battlefront series.Basically you are the squad leader of a 4 person squad.Delta 40Delta 62 Delta 07And you, Delta 38. Together, you form the Delta Squad. You are clone troopers that have been engineered to be the best of the best. You are the future. You are the commandos. You must strategically command your squad in order to beat back the droid army on various missions across various planets. Something i'd like to mention is that the droids are very tough in this game, while in the movie they seemed like bumbling pieces of metal that could easily be taken down.  Initially I started the game on normal but had to change it to easy because it was too hard. I may re-play the game on medium though. But even on easy, the separatists are a force to be reckoned with and the enemies are remarkably tough. This makes for thrilling gameplay as all the responsibility falls on your shoulders as the squad leader, and you must make hard decisions. In the end, only 2 things matter. Win the battle, and get your squad out alive. But later in the game, you must choose which is more important....Each squad member has a unique personality, and as the game progresses you feel very close to them. The members are: Scorch, (62)Fixer, (40) Sev, (07) And you, 38. Or, Boss.You are alone, cut off, and all you have is your squad. You do whatever it takes to save them. I'll never get tired of hearing:Engage snipe maneuver, Delta.Rearrange some architecture, commando.I want some explosives here, Delta!Stop limping around and get some bacta, soldier.Engage anti armor position, delta!Something i'd like to mention is that your character's full number is actually 1138. 38 is just for short. I think that's cool because THX-1138 was a screenplay George Lucas wrote in college. So that's a neat little Easter egg there.And also, at the end of the game you can hear the x wing pilots from a New Hope saying things they said during the Death  Star run. So that's another cool little Easter egg. I also like how you can attack your squad, and they fight back! I tried killing my squad mates one time, and found myself fighting against them. I actually felt really bad. XDThis game is spectacular, extremely fun, unique, and a must-buy. It was so much fun for me because I am a HUGE fan of the Clone Troopers. I just think they're really cool, and being able to not only be one, but be a commander throughout this game, was an incredible experience.I would definitely, whole heartily recommend this game. The only thing I'm disappointed about is that there isn't more. I thought there'd be several more planets and missions leading up to Order 66. Oh well, maybe there will be a sequel in the future called Imperial Commando. (Just please don't have EA make it) I give this game a 10/10.The game is extremely fun with a great story, good voice actors, great controls, hard bosses that require strategy to take down, good weapons, great graphics, and a great atmosphere. Would play again.			"

												Star Wars Republic Commando is a unique experience for a Star Wars game. You don't play as a Jedi or a Bounty Hunter or any of the things in between. Instead you get plopped directly into the head of a Clone trooper and thrown onto the battlefields of Episode Two.As a clone trooper you don't get much back story or indeed any motivation beyond the occasional communication pop-up on your UI that tells you where to go next. Indeed you were bred for combat and unquestioning loyalty and that's what you do. This rather unique aspect does a lot of alleviate many of the problems that usually plague Star Wars games and makes Republic Commando a rather enjoyable experience.You are not just any Clone Trooper however, you are a squad leader and this is where the gameplay of Republic Commando comes into play. With you have 3 additional commandos, each with their own area of expertise. A sniper, a demolitions expert and a hacker. As you go through the missions you will be able to order your team around, into cover, mounting gun positions, or performing specific tasks suited to their specialty through a context sensitive command system. You basically just point at an object and click and one of your squad members takes the appropriate action. This all works surprisingly well and trying to play the game as a lone wolf tends to end badly as the game features some rather impressive AI, both on the part of your teammates and the enemies.The game is very pretty and in particular the background deserves notice as there is always something else going on there which often looks every bit as intense as the fight you are distracted from.The voice-acting is pretty good for a game but you will quickly realize that the developers took a little shortcut here as the many different voices and accents the clones have makes you wonder just how similar they really are.Star Wars Republic Commando is an attempt to take the Star Wars franchise into the squad based tactical genre and it comes away from the attempt quite nicely although it is a game that has it's flaws, most notably the campaign is extremely short and ends with a cliffhanger that's never resolved as this is the only game in the franchise. Still all in all it's one of the best Star Wars games out there and one of those that can be held up as a good game in it's own right.			"

												This game...Is a masterpiece, I want to cry for the fact that the sequel was dropped, this was one of my favorite games as as a kid. If you haven't seen the behind the scenes video, a real special operations veteran was used for the MoCap in this game, which really made the authentic ""Elite clone squad"" Feeling. The game's graphics are just amazing, the squad system is beautifully crafted, AND LIKE HALF LIFE 3, we were left hanging in the end with no sequel in sight.But I digress, this game was one of the games (besides splinter cell, which is my first favorite) that holds a VERY warm special place in my heart. I recently discovered today it was on steam for only $9.99, letm e get straight I am no ""diehard star wars fan"" But it was just one of the games I grew up with, and since my disc barely worked anymore, I was ecstatic to see it was on steam, and from what I hear, you can still play multiplayer through direct IP connection, what's not to like? If you are a fan of star wars, but not a huge fan, this game is for you, because yes, it does have all the star wars aspects, but it's as if those are just masks making the game more beatiful over a core elite squad game.This game is  WORTH THE $9.99, BUY IT!

												As a Star Wars fan, this was fun.  It's a first person shooter, has nothing to do with the elite characters of the movie, instead you are a clone trooper.  The teamwork works great, at least they listen to what you want them to do.  Outside of that, the AI isn't great for either your partners or for the enemies.  There are a variety of enemies, some that are rather tough, and others that just annoy.  The weapons are decent, but nothing spectacularly new.  The storyline is intriguing and connects somewhat well within the Star Wars Universe.  The fun, didn't last through the entire game though as the game gets quite repetitive.  The graphics aren't too interesting to look at these days, and this isn't to say that they aren't good, just that there's no real art design that stands out.  Everything seems bleak and without much detail.If you are not a Star Wars fan, this may not tickle your fancy.  However, it's a short game that can easily be beaten in less than 10 hours.  I enjoyed it.			"

												It's not very often a Star Wars game (specifically this one) goes on sale. I remember playing this a few years ago when it first came out, just picked it up on Steam, too. Had loads of fun playing the campaign, lots of great memories from this game. I remember hugging the healing stations because I was worried I'd get killed during the next fight all the time.You can play as different specialized Clone Troopers (i.e. Demolitions, Sniper, etc.).This is actually one of those games where commanding your own squad is fun. The AI is decent (not perfect, but close enough). You can use turrets from fallen Republic Gunships and mow down enemies with it. All in all, a great game.. multiplayer wasn't that bad too. I had lots of fun dueling 1v1. One day, I was lucky enough to pull a direct headshot by bouncing a Wookie crossbow projectile off the wall on somebody. :D: Been a while, and I can't remember the name of the map, but it was an arena map called ""Clone Training"".I give the game a 8.5/10. Although the game was pretty enjoyable, I remember it being short (a few hours only) and there were some brutal levels.. well, that's AI squad-based gameplay for ya. Anyways, you can listen to me yap all day, but this goes on my list of Top 10 SW video games ever released. It's on sale right now for just $3, worth buying if you're a fan of Star Wars.			"

												""GET YOURSELF SOME BACTA, SOLDIER""The prequels were flawed yes, but at least the Episodes II-III era (2002-2005) spawned some sweet SW games, for many the last great era for LucasArts (everything went downhill after 2005).Republic Commando is ""THE"" SW shooter, by that I mean the best SW shooter of all time (unless Dark Forces gets a remake, which is unlikely next to impossible). The Halo 2-Half 2 influence is evident (minus riding a vehicle and the gravity gun) and the game tries to be lean and mean (not bloody though). Explosions and melee attacks are everywhere, and the cheesy-cute humor of the prequels is nowhere to be found. Overall the game provides a solid Clone Wars experience.The graphics still look very good for a mid-00s game and the sound design is superb.But sadly, the game has some clear flaws, which put the game in a  8-8.5 out of 10 zone at best (it could have been a 10 out of 10)a) too short (like 4-5 hours on easy). Also, some people will find frustrating that there are only three (extended) maps: Geonosis, Republic Ship and Kashyyyk. b) the AI of the squad is not that great, they get killed easily on medium difficulty.c) some enemies are ridiculously overpowered and hard to kill without heavy weapons (which are hard to find)That said, the game was loved-popular enough so fans demanded a sequel, which never came due to the mismanagement of LucasArts that slowly killed the company until its 2012 disappearance.

												The second best Star Wars Game of modern times, behind Legendary masterpiece Jedi Outcast.  Ive played it at least five times, and it still kicks major a.s.s.  The authentic feeling of Star Wars is what makes or breaks a game set in this universe, and almost all others fail to capture it.  Republic Commando has that feeling all the way to its bones, from the Clone Squad commands, to the run and gun of military squad combat, this game looks right, sounds right, and feels right.  Ready up Commandos.			"

If u have all three attachments fully stocked with ammo u will be able to solve any situation.~Some enemies can be a pain sometimes but that gives it that touch that u arent invincible and u need to think before u act~Graphics are pretty good~And there is also a decent multiplayerCons:~Ocational glitches/bugs for example a team mate goes down but cant be revived~The AI can sometimes be a little dumb but nothing too major~For me atleast the story was a bit too shortConclusion:I would give this game 9/10.

												One of the best star wars games I have ever played. It  was rather challenging at certain times and you had to really work as a leader to control your squad if you wanted to win. It did a wonderful job of getting the star wars feeling right in level design and  art. The only problem I had with it was it started to feel slow after i had played it off and on for 2 weeks. But it is an older game and free roam wassnt as standard as most shoooter games today. Also i have to remark the bonus making of the game videos are Well worth the watch for any fan and are availible in game for free.			"

												It's probably one of the best Star Wars game you could get, it's cheap, fun, has a great soundtrack & nice level design, my favourite being aboard the republic ship. The levels are short but theirs plenty of them so you will get at least 8-10 hours of gameplay worth going through the campaign. I did have a few problems with the DPI it was way to fast & I had to set it down to 1 just to look around & aim correctly. I wasn't able to play at 1080p even tried going into the files to change it but it was pretty buggy.			"

A game ahead of its time Star Wars Rebublic Commando is set in the early stages of the Clone Wars. You are a clone commander in charge of Delta Squad, the republics deadliest soldiers. You and your squad are sent behind enemy lines and must fight the droids of CIS (confederacy of independent systems) However, the droids are not the only threat you must face.A very clever and simple squad based gameplayWhen I first dove into the game, I was expecting a squad based system which would be confusing, similar to Red Orchestra 2. The system was actually pretty simple. It did not take long to learn the mechanics. You have just a few buttons which you can use to give your squad commands. Commands such as defend this area, follow me, advance (search and destroy), cancel orders. You can also order your men to different highlighted positions like, sniper,anti armor, turrets and grenade. Might sound confusing, but it really isn't. I was surprised of the good physics in this game and the gameplay itself was fun, but only for a couple of hours. The maps and basic gameplay got a bit repetitive and I got bored after a half an hour or so each session. Still, it was fun and entertaining.Short and loose storythe story was not as good as I hoped. You get a short prolouge cutscene that tells you about the clone commandos. The story jumps from one place to the next. At first you are at Geonosis and suddenly you are investigating a lost republic war ship. So it is not a direct storyline throughout the game. What I did like was the chatter between your men. It was funny at many occasions and you got more feelings about your men. It also ends with a cliffhanger and since republic commando 2 was cancelled I doubt that there will be a sequel anytime soon. Though, the developers leaked information about how the story would continue, so the ending is still there.Worth it?It was a game ahead of its time, so I can't complain about anything really, except the story. Other than the story being very loose I would still recommend bying it, especially if you are a Star Wars fan. The music is top notch. Note: Multiplayer does not work anymore, so you will only be able to play singleplayer, still worth it though "

												Republic Commando was the first real ""modern"" Star Wars game, at least in my opinion. While there were Star Wars FPS's, this one was more down to Earth and grounded.The game features no jedi, and it's less focused on running and gunning. It's gameplay more revolves around manipulating your AI squadmates to accomplish certain roles. Due to the nature of the game's map design this is less annoying then it sounds. Never does the game force you into platforming sections, or introduce puzzles. It is pure unadulterated Star Wars gameplay at it's purest.If singleplayer isn't your bag there's also highly entertaining multiplayer. The multiplayer could best be compared as a lovechild between Halo 2 and UT2k4, at it's finest moments. It has something for everybody.			"

												A Star Wars game without any Jedi around, instead focusing on squad-based battles and tactical combat solving. As an FPS it takes inspiration from all the right sources, including Metroid Prime for its famous HUD.Pros* Tacticool as ♥♥♥♥. Door breaching, landmine ambush, air support, everything is there* Good ability at creating a believable atmosphere with a mix of large battles and claustrophobic resistance* Excellent OST, with some very bad asses Mandalorian songsCons* Low variety of weapons and enemies* You're never given quite enough ammunition to kill armored droidsNote that the ending is a slightly-frustrating cliffhanger that will likely never be resolved. Make sure to properly order your squaddies around for you won't go far without being a good field officer.			"

												Equal parts tactical strategy game and first-person shooter, Republic Commando proves itself greater than the sum of its parts.  Enemy encounters are varied and fun, in a way that only sci-fi shooters can be with their assortment of alien and robotic adversaries.  Squad commands are doled out in a system that is about as intuitive as possible, at least until voice recognition works its way into the realm of gaming.  On top of it all, great writing that de-emphasizes the Jedi Order does something that George Lucas failed to do; it makes the prequels cool.  Republic Commando is the rare Star Wars game that is more than just a money grab, and you know it because it would be just as good without all of the licensing.

												I liked that it involves mostly clones, as they were my favorite characters in the Star Wars saga, and the fact that this game is based on clone commandos has made it one of my most favorite games in Star Wars. I liked the Campaign as well as multiplayer while it lasted. What I dislike is the fact that GameSpy is dead, which means multiplayer is as well. It had been one of my favorite games mostly because of the multiplayer, and now my excitement in this game has decreased because of that very reason. While there are websites that offer to fix this problem, such as moddb.com, it's still not as fun as it was anymore. If there is anyone who is a fellow commando fan reading this right now, hope is not lost. There is a website that is dedicated to Republic Commando content that is attempting to reach enough followers to demand a sequel to a game that was once in it's prime. I will not reveal the name of this group, as I am taking precautions not to attract any attention of hackers or trollers because I do not want anything drastic to happen to this group that is attempting to keep the Commando name alive. Good luck commandos, and I'll see you on the battlefield.			"

												I liked this game, and keep wondering why there isn't a sequel out given *spoilers* *spoilers* *more spoilers*. I'm hardly a fan of the Star Wars prequels, but the characters and plot are interesting and solid. I especially love the first half of chapter 2, with its ""haunted house"" feel. I can even get over the fact that Scorch is voiced by Raphael Sbarge (that guy who will forever be Carth Onasi to me and who only has one acting style), given that all the squad's personalities are both clearly defined and show development across the plot-arc. For instance, I love how Fixer is incredibly straitlaced but sometimes the facade cracks, just a little.I also don't play a whole lot of shooters, but I really enjoyed the feeling of being in charge of a squad that reacts to me without a whole lot of complicated keyboard commands to memorize. In fact, there's only one button to direct every terrain-contextualized action, and that's okay with me! A little odd that the boys will get infinite ammo of whatever type they're using while they're in a terrain position, but hey, Scorch lobbing unlimited grenades is also okay with me. The graphics are also fine for how old it is, and I like the little details like the visor windshield wiper for rain/blood/oil/scratches(!?). It was a little frustrating at times when running low on ammo or health and with no way to get more before having to survive difficult waves of enemies, but that's almost certainly because I'm not very good at shooters. :POverall, I really got the feeling that I was part of a team while playing this game, and it was really awesome.

												I love this game. Like this game has single-handedly made me look back into Star Wars games in general. Republic Commando is basically what happens when you make a Tom Clancy game, put it in the Star Wars universe, and make your AI allies actually listen to you. I know, I could hardly understand it myself at first.Your squad actually listens to you instead of going into random rooms (a la Mass Effect) or not doing anything (some Tom Clancy games). But even without the great ally AI, the game still holds up well. The gameplay is surprisingly furious for a mid 2000s shooter, and you'll nearly die many times in the crazy firefights that ensue during the game. The game's multiplayer is also fun (somewhat similar to Halo 1/2's splitscreen multiplayer) but not as lasting as the campaign. The game's story length (~8.5 hours) is also respectable given the depth and action. Did I mention that your allies actually friggin do what you tell them to do, even in a firefight?Honestly the only downside to this game is its lack of sequel. The game ends on an obvious cliffhanger that was meant to segue into a sequel, as one was in development before this even released. Unfortunately the project got cancelled, so the ending just gets left with nothing to follow up on, which is a shame. I wish this game was given as much love as The Force  Unleashed; it'd be more deserving to be sure.			"

												I'll make this review short and sweet ( maybe ).STAR WARS™ Republic Commando™ is as it shows an FPS game featuring the Republic Commandos' dangerous missions throughout their first year(s) in combat. The gameplay is pretty good and for all you gamers out there with ridiculously sucky laptops or computers that have horrible fps in modern games, this game will run beautifully in your system. Your teammates are quite smart even though they are just AI's, they warn you about everything and anything throughout the game. Star Wars fan or not this game is truly a must have if you're interested in First Person Shooting games with a well made story. If you're thinking of buying this then do it, you absolutely wont regret it and if you do, well sucks to be you.			"

												This has to be one of my favorite games of all time. Not because it is Star Wars or anything like that. Partly cause it is Star Wars actually. But it has a certain feel to it that other games don't give me. Especially FPS wise. FPS wise I mainly stick with Halo cause I really enjoy Sci-Fi. For awhile Halo was my go to FPS. But this game takes that position now. Yes, I could be fighting the flood and watching them devour people. But for some reason that never made me as nervous as when I was roaming the abandoned Republic ship as Clones got torn limb from limb in the room next to me. Yes, I could be trying to take down a hunters. But a lot of villains in this game provide much more of a challenge.Another aspect of the game is the squad. You control your squad and tell them where to go. I'm constantly checking my squad's health and changing their positions. Yes, some current games have squads. You kinda control them, but I don't think as much as in this game. But that's just my opinion.With a compelling story and constant threats trying to kill you, this game makes for a great experience.			"

												10/10, immersive, incredibly fun, great combat and fun enemies, along with a hell of a lot of carnage to dish out in brutal combat. (although Super Battle Droids are WAY overpowered) weapons are unique, each one has its own style, and all your squad have their own personalities.Boss (you): Fearless leader.Scorch: Fun loving joker.Fixer: By the book loyal trooper.Sev: Brutal combat crazed vet.(SPOILER)*Salute*May you rest in peace Sev.

Multiplayer Shall Live On! How to play Multiplayer 
A Guide for STAR WARS™ Republic Commando
By: (Eyeris)Toxicvirus1230

			Got Republic Commando? Want to play online with friends/others? Think its impossible to play multiplayer after GameSpy died? Think again! This guide shows how to play Multiplayer with others/friends!		


This game is pretty amazing. First of all, for a game that came out in 2005, the graphics are really well-done. The textures and graphic layouts really showed how much time LucasArts put into this game. The story is awesome too, especially for those who are interested in Star Wars lore. No spoilers on the story; I will let you experience it in full :). Lets not forget the Multiplayer, which is probably the best experience I had with this game. Once you finish the amazing story this game has, you will definitely have fun battling it out in the Multiplayer mode, especially if you love Arena FPS games like Unreal Tournament and Quake Live.I will recommend this game to anyone who loves Star Wars, or just loves online Arena FPS games.

												A solid game. Hard to belive it was made in 2005, with the in-game squad mechanics being better than the ones found in most modern games. The gameplay changes little but there's something so endearing about it that it doesn't really matter. Not much else to say. Just get the game. It's definitely worth it.			"

												This is probably one of the best FPS that are out on the market today. I have been playing this game for 7+ years and have enjoyed every second of it. Before the server shutdown, this was an amazing multiplayer game. There was constantly 50+ people playing per day on every server, and everyone enjoying themselves.As for the campaign, they really put in a lot of detail into this. They were able to establish a squadron of elite troopers known as ""Delta Squad"" and tell us about their story and what they were able to accomplish. Like any good game with a story, there is also a lot of sad parts, and enjoyable parts. The creators of this game also were able to establish a few easter-eggs for us as the players to figure out, and made the graphics far ahead of its time.All in all, I love this game and always will. If the servers weren't shut down, I would definitley recommend this game for anyone. But if you enjoy Star Wars, and Campaigns, then this is the game for you. One of the best on the market.			"

												Didn't expect much since it was a game that came out a decade ago.  But, surprisingly, this game hold up well on PC.  Although I can't get the bumpmapping option to work (using AMD/ATi card, seems to be for Nvidia cards), the graphics looks good (think almost at the level of Rainbow Six: Vegas on PC or Mass Effect ground mission).I feel that the weapon feel underpowered and I had difficulty at first.  But slowly I learn to rely on the squad members more, commanding them take sniping/grenade position, it became less overwheming.  I am only over one-fifth of the game and I like what I have played so far.  You don't need to be Star Wars fan to enjoy (I am not).			"

												Zero Dark Thirty - Star Wars Edition. These boys would fit right in with modern day Navy SEALs or US Army Rangers, heck they even have a little SWAT in them. Call of Duty ain't got nothing on this gem. Their personalities are unique and easy going, if you can get used to TMNT then you can handle Delta Squad. The military tactics are down to Earth and easily recongnizable, plus each has a distinct voice unlike the Clone Wars Series were everyone has the same one, gives each one personality only your main character has Jango's voice. So if you are looking for realistic gritty Star Wars without any of those pesky Jedi or Sith, this one is for you. Its nice you can for once block out the Sith or the Jedi and pretend just for a moment Star Wars is actually a WAR and not a philosophical battle between a guy with a red sword and someone else with a (insert color here) sword. Very refreshing. It makes the Star Wars Universe seem not so far away after all and all the more enjoyable.			"

												I just finished the game and I just have to say that it's pretty damn good. Especially for its current price.Now, the combat is Bioshock style. Meaning that you just shoot and at some moment the enemy just falls down and is dead. There's no real feedback to the damage you're doing and due to that the gunplay is very unsatisfying. The melee however was strong and it made me take a lot of risks to just take out the enemy. If a game gets me to risk myself and forces me to not play safe without it feeling unfair and just artificial, then I'd say that it does a good job.The story is what it is. It's 3 main campaigns, each is about 2-3 hours. On normal, the game was just as difficult as it should be. I lost the game a few times, but not enough to have the game feel unfair. Almost every death felt like it was my fault and preventable.The graphics look pretty good and the game runs very well as well, even on my 4GB DDR3, FX-4100, GT640.The game's been in many bundles, so it's pretty cheap when it comes to value. You'll be able to trade for it no problem.One problem though was that it ends in an annoying cliffhanger and the last mission also ends very abruptly, which makes me feel that they were just pushing it out as quickly as possible. The A.I. is pretty good for your team, but the same can't be said about your allies and enemies. They usually just sit and do nothing and get themselves killed. I know that all allies are meant to die, but it's just so damn annoying that they die to one minion or something.Overall, is this game worth the full price? If you're not on a shoe-string budget, then yeah. Is it worth a bundle purchase or a trade? Yeah, definitely. Overall 7/10(All games start at a 5/10 and move up/down based on its pros/cons)			"

												This game was my entire childhood. I played it nonstop over and over again and created very strong bonds with the characters. This is a truly amazing game that everyone, Star Wars fan or not, needs to play. The squad based gameplay is just incredible and the story is fantastic. Your squadmates are anything but bland, and will keep you entertained throughout the entire story with their very distinct personalities. This game is one of the few that truly deserves a sequel,  one where we save Sev, of course. "

												One of the best action FPS ever made. It's kinda like a Halo clone but to say it's a ripoff of halo would be unfair. It plays kinda like a first person Ghost Recon or Rainbow Six Vegas but with less strategy. The whole game is just really well made and you can tell the developers put their heart & soul in this. The characters in the game feel so lively and it feels like YOU ARE the commando the entire time. Using the DC-17m with the blaster rifle attachment never gets old and the sounds in the game sound very satisfying from blaster shots to droid noises. It is a rich FPS experience with a cheap price tag. Well worth your money. Easily one of the best star wars game.			"

												This game came out in 2005 and has a much better squad system then halo: reach which came out in 2010. You play as Delta 38 aka Boss, leader of an elite clone commando squad. You lead your squad of 4 commandos across 3 different campaigns during the era of the clone wars. Each campaign is relatively short (around 2 hours) but feel unique enough to give you a different experience through each one. Atmosphere is great and so is the soundtrack. Using your squad effectively is very important to succeed in this game. You can't finish this game by yourself you need to use your AI controled squad. Your squad consists of 3 other commandos that all have different strengths and personalities, which leads to some good interactions and interesting dialogue. The squad commanding is very simple but also one of the most effective ways i've ever seen in any game, even in 2016. the game ends on a cliffhanger ending, originally planned to continue the story in a sequel. unfortunatly this game got scrapped so the game ends with a very important part of the story unexplained.

												I can't reccomend this game enough. As a kid, I loved the fact it was a gritty Star Wars game. it really showed a side to the galaxy that had not really been shown. The game has a tactical/strategic aspect of managing your three comrades and their positions, while trying to be an effective member of the team yourself. I started playing this again recently, and I still love it. Obviously the graphics are not great by todays standards, but the game play is still really fun. I still tilt my head away when my team breeches a door, and I still pray every once and awhile that a new version will be made.			"

												This is one of the most criminally-underrated shooters ever made. The game manages to fully immerse the player in the Star Wars universe without using Jedi, force powers, or any other hallmarks typical of the Star Wars franchise. This is a tactical first-person shooter played from the perspective of a Clone Trooper, one of the expendable ""mooks"" who drop like flies in the movies and are predecessors to the Stormtroopers, the ultimate ""disposable bad guy."" Each member of the squad is a clone, but they behave with distinctive personalities and voices that make you actually care about them. The game has a fairly good difficulty curve, with the game gradually spacing bacta tanks and ammo dumps farther and farther apart as the game progresses without becoming noticeable. You will need to use teamwork to knock out larger enemies like spider droids, which are almost impossible to down with the limited grenade launcher ammo you have. To drive the importance of team work home, the game has several sections where the squad splits, meaning you have no one to revive you if you die. And you have at most 6 hits on normal difficulty before you're a goner. The presentation is fantastic. The graphics have aged well and it runs smoothly on modern operating systems with no compatibility issues. The soundtrack is a masterpiece, with memorable pieces like the Mandalorian chant ""Vode An"" punctuating intense action sequences, as well as familiar snippets from the film scores. The game will throw in bits of fan-service such as a squad mate quipping ""these must be the droids we're looking for"" which just make you chuckle even under pressure. The AI is decent but will occasionally get stuck behind barriers when rushing to revive you, leading to frustration. The cooperative nature of the campaign makes the lack of online co-op campaign play very glaring. If this game ever gets a sequel, this feature needs to be added first. The campaign only features three planets, and is pretty short. None of the multiplayer maps are very interesting. These are probably due to the game's status as a tie-in for Episode III's film release with crunched development time. Just get this game. You will not be disappointed. It's not perfect by any means but its extremely minor flaws do little to hamper an amazing experience. For a 9-year-old game it's extremely playable and not dated at all.			"

												Like a swift kick to the stomach, this game will leave you doubled-over and gasping for breath hours after you finish playing. How many times have I been forced to kill a spider droid on my own with just a pistol because I ran out of ammo and my entire squad is incapacitated, or how often have I encountered a droid dispenser pumping out SBD's only to realize I've already used up all my anti-armor charges? These kinds of situations force to think ahead and plan & execute your strategies quickly. Keeping your squad organized is key. It's a beatiful thing when you give your squadmates commands and then find out that what you've decided for them to do is the perfect strategy. Good ol' Delta 38... he always knows just what to do.Squad control in the game is easy as pie, and the friendly AI is okay, though at times a bit frustrating. When they're given a command, the squad will go do it no matter what, even if it means doing something dumb like getting killed because they don't think to kill the things in their way first. Enemies are pretty stupid, but you don't need to be smart when you're a Super Battle Droid. The graphics and landscapes are dated but still amazing, from the windy, dusty canyons of Geonosis to the dark and foreboding forests of Kashyyyk. Except for the commando armor, everything is dark and gloomy. Gameplay is also awesome; everything is fast-paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat (and sometimes out of it completely). Whether you're desperately trying to hold off an endless stream of enemies as one of your squadmates plants explosives on a droid dispenser while another hacks into a security system while under fire, or you're clearing a path through a group of fat Trandoshan slavers in the maze-like corridors of an assault ship, there's never a dull moment in Republic Commando, and the hard difficulty mode is just right.The Squad:Delta 38, the main character. A tough-as-nails commando, 38 don't take no crap from nobody. Even when under heavy fire, he calmly gives commands like he's ordering food at a McDonald's drive-thru. He's the voice of reason, keeping everybody under control.Delta 62 (Scorch), the Demolitions expert. Scorch likes explosives. That's all there is to say.Delta 07 (Sev), is a fierce hunter. His best use is as a sniper, providing amazingly accurate covering fire for his squadmates. His only job is to kill, kill, kill.Delta 40 (Fixer), is just a good old-fashioned soldier. He's uncomplicated and a great fighter, and always follows orders. Other than that, I'm not quite sure what his deal is... I guess he's the ""computer expert,"" though any commando can slice any console.Each commando has his own personality. Scorch can be quite humorous at times, and Sev has some pretty disturbing things to say. One thing I don't understand is why do all have different voices? I though they were all the same clones...Trust me when I saw that even still to this day this game is worth every penny. The only thing I wish is that more games could be like this.			"

												I recommend this for a die hard Star Wars fan. If you're not a fan, then this is a generic shooter that falls down on some areas. Main problem is that the variety of enemies and guns are small, which makes the shooting part pretty boring. The leading of the team is made surprisingly well and the team is most of the time useful. For some reason, the team can only use grenades, sniper rifle and anti-tank weapons on certain specific points, which doesn't offer much of tactical challenge. Most of the time, you order your men to all available positions and run yourself to melee distance where enemy is very lacking. The game hasn't stood the test of time, and lacks memorable moments. Then again the music and sounds are pretty good that makes the atmoshphere quite good. Level design is boring, unmemorable and  and areas between loading times are really short(usually 5-10 minutes). The game doesn't change much after the first few levels. The game lasts for about 5 hours, which is good or bad depending if you like it or not.			"

												This game is great if you want a game with some tactics and a squad of AI team mates with actual personality that say one liners after every kill. The game play is good , a little bit linear , but the heroism of these guys is admirable. The graphics don't hold up to the ones that we have now but you can run it smoothly ( but watch out when you first enter the game , you might want to change the mouse sensitivity , plus what do you expect form a game that can run on 256MB of RAM and 64MB VRAM) and so far I haven't came across lag , only on large explosions. Finally the game is good and shows the other side of the conflict , not only the rebel part and their struggles but the comando's bravery , determination, marksmanship , skill and what actually is a united squad( not like CSGO or BF).

												 Star Wars: Republic Commando was a great experience for the most part, but it got fairly repetitive after a while. I got VERY tired of how many times I've had to breach a door or kill Droidekas and Super Battle Droids, and  It doesn't help how easy this game is. Anything one would consider ""challenging"" about it is how you run out of ammo in the midst of every other SBD/Droideka/Spider-Droid/Magna-Guard ""Ambush"". Because of the game's repetitive tendancies, the little length that the game has seems like less of an issue. The game does have it's moments though. For example, I personally found it fun mowing down Battle Droids and Geonosians every once in a while. The game's soundtrack was an enjoyable mix of music from the Prequel Trilogy, a bit of music from the Original Trilogy, and some original music written specifically for this game. Soundtrack aside, the graphics of this game compliment the feel of being in the Star Wars universe as well. Despite all the problems the game has, it still has that charm to it that many other Star Wars games have, so I definately reccomend it			"

												Back in 2005, Star Wars: Republic Commando was an unsung gaming classic, since then it has aged incredibly well in the gameplay department, standing defiant against both the tides of time and the trends of cover-based shooting and regenerating health. The gameplay, weapons, squad mechanics and even the graphics are still appealing even after all this time. The Steam release of Republic Commando is the third time I have bought this game, and I still love to play it now and again.The first thing that LucasArts got right with this game is making the Commados feel just as bad-♥♥♥ as the Jedi, while at the same time making them feel like soldiers. This is accomplished simply with the squad commands and context-dependant actions such as sniping and grenade positions. The scripted animations are icing on the cake like tackling droidekas or killing a kamikazi trandoshan with his own knives.But while each member of Delta Squad is comprehensively a one-man killing machine, they are not as invincible as a Jedi Knight, you need your squad, and again this really enhances the military feel of the game. Performing door breaches, setting up entrenched positions, and setting up covering fire while you outflank the enemy do a great deal to give Republic Commando a military feel that few modern military shooters can match. Putting you in command of Delta Squad was an awesome idea.Atmosphere is another area where this game shines. You start out being dropped behing enemy lines onto Geonosis, fighting your way into a Geonosian hive complex, down through a droid foundry and into a trade federation droid control ship. Then comes the genuinely creepy ghost-ship mission where you will be reduced to being hunted, alone by scavenger droids, and finally you will form part of the first wave in the republic's campaign on Kashyyyk, each location feels unique, and the game manages to capture the frenetic pace of a battlefield, the isolation and helplessness of a horror game, and the epic scale of a megaflora jungle.While some games start to feel dated and klunky as technology and design practices roll on, Republic Commando was at least 10 years ahead of its time. Everything about it shines, and the few flaws are minor and easily overlooked. Even when it's not on sale, this game is a bargain at ten bucks, the only negative point I can hold against Republic Commando is that it wasn't long enough and never had a sequel.			"

												This is an amazing game, and probably my favourite FPS.It's also very short. There are three mini campaigns, which you play through sequentially. One on Geonosis, one onboard a Republic cruiser and one on Kashyyyk, all of them clock in at around 2 hours each.With that big, primary concern out of the way, do I recommend this game? I sure do.Beyond nailing the aesthetic of the Clone Wars (more the one from the films than the tv series) or even Star Wars in general it is a solid single player squad based shooter.Single player and squad based might sound like opposing descriptors, but they're not. The three titular Commandos are your greatest weapon, both in effectiveness and enjoyment. Every Commando can do what you do, at the same rate.Do you want to dash in behind the enemy battle droids and take out their dispenser or do you want to send one of your squad mates to do it so you can lay down covering fire? You'll have them hack their way into power generators to reactivate them, but could just as well do that yourself.Should they fall you can revive them by running up to them with a defibrillator, or order one of the remaining squad mates to do that. Even if you get shot down yourself your squad mates will, at your orders, run over and put you back on your feet.Opposing you are the expected Trade Federation droids, the Geonosian bug army and, the only group not plucked directly from the prequel trilogy, Trandoshan mercenaries. These all have their share of easy fodder (the basic federation droids especially are little more than target practice) as well as a variety of overwhelmingly strong enemies.If the game did not work as well as it does then the best strategy would be to have your squad hold its ground out of harm's way, go at it alone and have them come revive you if it doesn't work out, and it's a testament to the excellent work the developers put into making the squad mechanics worthwhile.Orders are given easily, point at a piece of cover and press the Order button to have a squad mate take cover behind it. Same goes with entering turrets, breaching doors, setting explosives, etc. etc..It's a simple system, but it works well and is easy enough to do in the middle of hectic combat situations, of which there are plenty.The plot doesn't really add anything to existing lore, but it does its job and all of your squad mates have their own distinctive personalities, voices and preferences (though the explosives expert is no faster at placing a charge than his brothers).As long as you keep in mind that this is a short game and that it will primarily stay away from the plot of the films then you're in for a great time, and I recommend this title.

Short version: 87%Star Wars meets Rainbow Six in this tactical FPS, where you lead a group of strangely unique clones against the enemies of the Republic in three different campaigns. It may not be on the levels of Battlefront or the actual Rainbow Six titles, but Republic Commando is still a great game to play.Long version:Star Wars has a really successful and long relationship with the FPS genre, and Republic Commando is no exception. It may be nothing but a Rainbow Six clone in Star Wars costume, but this is hidden behind excellent game design.The story takes place during the Clone Wars, where the player takes the role of a special commando, leading his own squad straight into the heart of enemy lines. (The game is not tied to the animated series.)The settings are a bit clichéd: the battle of Geonosis, a (seemingly) desolate space ship, and Kashyyyk (because there always have to be wookies)… Luckily the writers knew these predictable settings need something to keep interest, so they spoil us with some good dialogues and fast-paced mission structure.The gameplay itself is simplistic squadron-based tactical combat where a single button replaces the command menu. It may be a significant limitation, but the system works as intended. All events are scripted, but you still need to continuously assess the situation and order your squad accordingly.Republic Commando may not reach early Halo levels with the AI, but it has nothing to be ashamed of. Just don’t expect your squad to win the game for you; team management is a very crucial point, especially in hold the line situations.The game didn’t age well from a technical standpoint; modern systems may have a bit of a problem running it properly. But when they do, you are offered one of the best Star Wars games to date to play with.			"

												Despite me not having many hours on here. I put countless hours on this years ago back on my original Xbox. This game (in my opinion) still holds up with modern day games. Unfortunately, there are few and far between squad-based games out there like this. The only ones that still carry on this tradition would be Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon for example (Singleplayer at least). Which we need more games like this, instead of these one man superpowered (yet normal) soldiers that can regenerate wounds after getting shot multiple times, and with unintelligent A.I.

												Despite me not having many hours on here. I put countless hours on this years ago back on my original Xbox. This game (in my opinion) still holds up with modern day games. Unfortunately, there are few and far between squad-based games out there like this. The only ones that still carry on this tradition would be Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon for example (Singleplayer at least). Which we need more games like this, instead of these one man superpowered (yet normal) soldiers that can regenerate wounds after getting shot multiple times, and with unintelligent A.I. (that seem like that they're just for show, like a hindrance, rather than helping the player take care of hostiles) that stays back 10 feet behind while the player is on the other side of the map, blasting their way through enemy territory.

												This game was a bit of Fun. I'll just say this: It is old, but it is fun. To be fair, i haven't touched the multiplayer. I Gather it doesn't work without 3rd party servers but I'm not to sure so i'm reviewing this on the single player.Pro's: 1) Star wars game! usually they are pretty good and this was deinetally one of them. If you enjoy Star Wars games, play this.2) The music is honorable to the movies. It was nice to be running around with battle music from star wars going in the background, it really supported the feel of the game.3) It's a different take on the general star wars universe. Your not a Jedi (Pro and Con) which is fun for a change in the Star Wars Games.4) Wookies!!!5) The allies in your party are not full retard. They actually do damage. You can also tell them to slice, blow up doors e.t.c and although primitive it still works and add's to the gamplay.Con's:1) The AI for the enemy is just...can't say anymore than that. 2) It's an older game. There are some moments were you can tell it's aged badly.**NOTE THIS ONE IS A SPOILER**3) The storyline. It's nothing fantastic but i feel that it could of been a little bit better. I like that it's set during the clone war era, i like running around as an elite team, i don't like how the storyline is practically inexistant. And that ending! What kind of ending is that.4) It is far from a long game. The whole game took me about 5.5 hours to complete.Overall, the game is enjoyable and i definetally suggest it for a star wars fan. 7/10			"

												Unlike a lot of people, I only thought this game was okay (I'm giving it a positive review, but only just). I also believe that a lot of this game's positive reviews are a result of nostalgia (or being a devout Star Wars fan) at its best. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a MASSIVE Star Wars fan, which is exactly why I'm being honest. The idea for the game was great, and parts of it are fun, but it could have been done much better. Killing Super Battle Droids was just too time consuming. Pumping clip after clip of ammo into them just got monotonous very quickly. I did however like the conclusion of the story and thought the music was great.The multiplayer is a different story altogether. It reminded of Halo, to an extent (especially when everyone is grabbing a rocket launcher) and had solid enough gameplay which makes it fun with a few friends.In short, if you want a great Star Wars shooter get Battlefront II with some mods, you won't regret. I would still however pick up this game if it was on sale for the right amount since it's about as solid as any other average FPS.			"

												An alright FPS with alright mechanics and an alright port. It sinks into mediocrity after the first few levels due to not giving the player enough interesting gadgets, enemies, toys and enviornments. One very unique feature however is squad commanding, as you send your troops to do certain tasks and get in certain formations on the battlefield. Worth the initial experience for a lower price.

												Star Wars: Republic Commando is a tactical first-person shooter set in the Star Wars universe, developed by LucasArts and published by Activision and LucasArts in 2005. The game uses the Epic Games Unreal Engine.In Star Wars: Republic Commando you play as an elite Clone Commando accompanied by three other squad members through three main missions with submissions included. In the game you investigate hostile areas and search for enemy Intel. You are Delta RC-1138 (Boss, orange suit), the leader of Delta 38 who meet up with Delta RC-1262 (Scorch, yellow suit), Delta RC-1140 (Fixer, green suit) and Delta RC-1207 (Sev, red suit). These elite Clone commandos are created at the clone factories on Kamino. As a squad leader you can order your squad members to attack, defend a position or blow up blockades and each squad member has its own abilities. During your military operations you will find yourself at Geonosis (Rocky desert planet) where droids are manufactured, at the Republic Assault Ship (RAS) and at Kashyyyk (Wookie Forest/Swamps Planet).I highly enjoyed this game because tactical functions and of the HUD (Head Up Display) interface which is built inside the Helmet of your character. Also the weapon designs are well done, for instance the DC-17m Commando Rifle Model which is an adaptable rifle of the Galactic Republic. You can change parts of the gun while in battle and switch a modular sniper- or anti-armor grenade launcher attachment when you progress into the storyline. I also liked the hidden blade (Knuckle Plate Vibro Blade) which comes in handy when you are out of ammunition or just for dealing massive damage in close-combat. The voice acting is great and the interaction between squad members makes the game feel lively. I highly recommend this game to people who like the Star Wars Universe or tactical first-person Sci-Fi shooters with great gameplay, certainly when the game is on sale! "

												Good FPS, though slightly old-school, ability to use team members to target enemies, take up positions, hack consoles, etc makes for good game play. Enemy aliens and droids range from easy to tricky depending on their numbers, location, and strategy. Fairly routine and predictable AI, but no less fun because of it. Will take an experienced player anywhere between 8 to 12 hours to play through. Fits right in the ""Clone Wars"" period nicely, with good voice acting, witty banter and a decent campaign. Not much to complain about, though the graphical options are limited, and it is necessary to tweak a settings.ini file for more recent resolutions. The graphics are far from amazing, but they get the job done for this relatively cheap and enjoyable game. So far as ""Star Wars"" titles go, this is a commendable mid-range effort, and a 7.5/10 rating seems about right. Don't expect a lot, but do expect to be able to make the most of what you get here.

												While the Star Wars franchise has had FPS success in the past with the Dark Forces/Jedi Knight titles, they had never attempted to produce a realistic and gritty FPS experience until Republic Commando. Sure, we've fired plenty of blasters, but we've always played as Jedi or a specific protagonist. In Republic Commando, you put on the armor of a soldier. You carry out missions and blast through hordes of enemies for the glory of the Empire!... uh... I mean the Republic! Yes, the Republic... Republic Commando is set during the prequels but it carries a much more serious tone than the films. The Clone Wars provide the perfect setting for a modern FPS and Lucasarts did a fine job of creating a decent shooter while keeping the player in their beloved Star Wars universe. It may not be the best FPS but it was made very well. The only things I can think of to complain about are the lack of enemy variety and the lack of a sequel. 8/10			"

												I have to say, I went into this game expecting it to be mediocre, and possibly able to tide me over for a few hours. It did a lot more than that. Let's start with gameplay. In all reality despite the fantastic feeling of commanding your squad it's fairly average. I went, I shot, I won. Simple as that. So you will really be playing this game for it's story, along with the atmosphere and characters. It all works exactly when it wants to work, and your team actually sounds like real people, not hastily done voice-acting as seen in some games (a personal favorite line of mine is from Sev, ""Boss, hold on to your guts while I rip out theirs""). The story spans about 9 hours (for me at least) and it is very well written, especially since it goes off of only three levels. Yes, you will get that many hours out of three stinkin' levels! Unfortunately it is poorly ended, and while I won't spoil anything it felt like they tried to cram a lot of what could have been another half hour to an hour of story into four minutes, and while it does wrap everything up, it just doesn't work that well. On to atmosphere. The only level where it was really polished was the second, on a ship attacked by Trandoshan mercenaries. It reeks of ""creepy"" and and really helps the build up of what is going on. Now then, time to talk enemies. Anything and everthing will kill you, except regular Battle Droids and Geonision babies. Yes, babies. Super Battle Droids will become the bane of your exisitance and everything you thought you knew about about them goes down the drain (Sorry Battlefront II players, you're done for). Something interesting is how different grenades I had know use for before became quite important to me once I learned what they good against, and I began cursing myself for using them on a Spider Droid and what-not. Overall, this game gave me a very enjoyable experience, and maybe someday I will get around to playing it again.My score: 7/10For as much as I praise this game, the levels did feel a bit drawn out at times, as well as the enemy health bars. But on the other hand, I did kill five geonision babies by electrocuting them into little bits. So thats a plus.			"

												Star Wars Republic Commando is a first-person shooter about four deadly commandos, the Delta squad, helping the Republic's war effort. You take direct control of the squad's leader, Boss, while he guides his comrades, Sev, Scorch and Fixer, through their missions against the separatists forces.The main beef of the game is indeed to issue orders to your squad (set a demolition charge here, destroy that specific target, ...) in order to advance in the levels. Thankfully your mates' AI is quite handy and won't give you any serious problems, aside from some rare instances (it's worth mentioning that you and your clones aren't friendly fire-proof and your comrades have an annoying tendency to lock themselves into place if facing a mine field). The members of delta Squad can even revive each other if put down, which is rather fortunate.You can access a wide array of weapons (an assault and a sniper rifle, a bazooka of some kind, a pistol, ...) in order to battle several rather challenging enemies. The opponents in Republic Commando are indeed very hard to defeat and range from suicidal infantry units with little sense of survival to very sturdy and hard-hitting mini-bosses who can dish out a lot of damage towards your squad. You don't get to face any real boss, though.Republic Commando's rather short lenght is a well-known fact: it clocks around six or seven hours of gameplay. Many players tend to overlook this in favor of the game's great atmosphere, good soundtrack and solid gameplay, on top of providing a videogame about Star Wars without the usual Jedi and the Force angle and packed with a more gritty and edgier concept			"

And after all these years and with all the Next Gen FPS titles out today, theres just something about this game that sets it apart from all other games that are out today. Of course the graphics are outdated, but the gameplay is just incredible and the story is actually very interesting!

It is full of action and it can be pretty difficult at times. I am very surprised how this game turned out to be.			"

												This is one of those old games that are just amazing and don't get enought recognition. The worlds can vary from cramped corridors to open areas leadng to many different playstyles, the enemys have there own specific patterns and weaknesses, the soud effects are all like ""pew pew"" which is awsome, and you squadmates ohhhhh thats the cherry on the icecream wait not even that it is the WHOLE GOD DANM ICECREAM. Your squad (Delta Squad) is a squad of Republic Commandos. You play 38 the squad leader you have Sev the sniper who is your the tough badass character , Fixer the tech ranger who plays as the smart but squad player guy, and Scorcher the demolition expert and has the comic relief personality (He's my favorite because he reminds me of me).  If you don't get the picture of how badass and helpful these guys are let me clarify. We've all played Bioshock Infinite so imagine 3 other Elizibeths who can all revive you (no costs except not as much health) can take up many positions such as sniping, manning turrets, etc, fight back, and have amazing performance in ranged and CQB combat situations. There is also the option of teh good old either come in guns a blazing or take is the slow hacking stealth way. It also has a multiplayer but the real bread and butter is the solo campain.This game was a amazing experiece for me and is not only $10 but is better than any $60 Cal of Duty ot Battlfield campain.

And after all these years and with all the Next Gen FPS titles out today, theres just something about this game that sets it apart from all other games that are out today.

												Star Wars Republic Commando is a first-person shooter about four deadly commandos, the Delta squad, helping the Republic's war effort. You take direct control of the squad's leader, Boss, while he guides his comrades, Sev, Scorch and Fixer, through their missions against the separatists forces.The main beef of the game is indeed to issue orders to your squad (set a demolition charge here, destroy that specific target, ...) in order to advance in the levels. Thankfully your mates' AI is quite handy and won't give you any serious problems, aside from some rare instances (it's worth mentioning that you and your clones aren't friendly fire-proof and your comrades have an annoying tendency to lock themselves into place if facing a mine field). The members of delta Squad can even revive each other if put down, which is rather fortunate.You can access a wide array of weapons (an assault and a sniper rifle, a bazooka of some kind, a pistol, ...) in order to battle several rather challenging enemies. The opponents in Republic Commando are indeed very hard to defeat and range from suicidal infantry units with little sense of survival to very sturdy and hard-hitting mini-bosses who can dish out a lot of damage towards your squad. You don't get to face any real boss, though.Republic Commando's rather short lenght is a well-known fact: it clocks around six or seven hours of gameplay. Many players tend to overlook this in favor of the game's great atmosphere, good soundtrack and solid gameplay, on top of providing a videogame about Star Wars without the usual Jedi and the Force angle and packed with a more gritty and edgier concept			"

												While the Star Wars franchise has had FPS success in the past with the Dark Forces/Jedi Knight titles, they had never attempted to produce a realistic and gritty FPS experience until Republic Commando. Sure, we've fired plenty of blasters, but we've always played as Jedi or a specific protagonist. In Republic Commando, you put on the armor of a soldier. You carry out missions and blast through hordes of enemies for the glory of the Empire!... uh... I mean the Republic! Yes, the Republic... Republic Commando is set during the prequels but it carries a much more serious tone than the films. The Clone Wars provide the perfect setting for a modern FPS and Lucasarts did a fine job of creating a decent shooter while keeping the player in their beloved Star Wars universe. It may not be the best FPS but it was made very well. The only things I can think of to complain about are the lack of enemy variety and the lack of a sequel. 8/10			"

												Good FPS, though slightly old-school, ability to use team members to target enemies, take up positions, hack consoles, etc makes for good game play. Enemy aliens and droids range from easy to tricky depending on their numbers, location, and strategy. Fairly routine and predictable AI, but no less fun because of it. Will take an experienced player anywhere between 8 to 12 hours to play through. Fits right in the ""Clone Wars"" period nicely, with good voice acting, witty banter and a decent campaign. Not much to complain about, though the graphical options are limited, and it is necessary to tweak a settings.ini file for more recent resolutions. The graphics are far from amazing, but they get the job done for this relatively cheap and enjoyable game. So far as ""Star Wars"" titles go, this is a commendable mid-range effort, and a 7.5/10 rating seems about right. Don't expect a lot, but do expect to be able to make the most of what you get here.

												Absolutley loved this game when it was new, was so excited about it back then I baught my first ever new aftermarket Graphics/video Card in order to play it at the best settings and it was beautiful. So many years later and the game is still awesome. Although the online multiplayer comunity has died since then, the gameplay is still just as fun and the squad A.I. and simple commands are still one of the best I've come across. In adddition I came to really like the squadmates as their own characters with their little banter back and forth. However I do have to point out and easily over looked physics issue, as the ""ragdoll bodies"" was new back then, sometimes the dead enemy units shake/twitch/jiggle about one the ground for a bit. Personally I think it's funny looking, but it is noticeable and you might see it a few times throughout the game. Other than that, the game is pretty much flawless in terms of squad shooter gameplay and audio  This game deserves a good sequal, but unfortunately probably won't get one. Anyways I'd recomend this game if you enjoy shooters and anything Star Wars, if you're not a fan of either, then this game may not be for you.			"

												Very linear, hardly any replayability, but I thought it was a fun ride. There are only three missions. But all of them are quite long. Finished it at almost exactly 10 hours. Coming off from Battlefront II, I thought this game is much better in terms of presentation, especially concerning the first person view. The audio and visual effects in this one just feel more ""real"". I also like the strategy aspect of it. Fights were as much as a test of how well you issue orders as it is a test of your ability to shoot things. Though I found that it was really easy to just run and knife scores of enemies so long as there isn't a ""heavy"" thrown into the mix.The ending sequence was pretty anti-climactic. The endings for the first two missions were harder and more tense.			"

It puts you into the shoes of a leader of an elite squad of soldiers known as Delta squad. You can manuever and order your squad at will with multiple keys for oders. Telling them what formation to be in, or what foes to target. This game is just simply amazing, it has an AMAZING story and amazing gameplay.

												I have to say, I went into this game expecting it to be mediocre, and possibly able to tide me over for a few hours. It did a lot more than that. Let's start with gameplay. In all reality despite the fantastic feeling of commanding your squad it's fairly average. I went, I shot, I won. Simple as that. So you will really be playing this game for it's story, along with the atmosphere and characters. It all works exactly when it wants to work, and your team actually sounds like real people, not hastily done voice-acting as seen in some games (a personal favorite line of mine is from Sev, ""Boss, hold on to your guts while I rip out theirs""). The story spans about 9 hours (for me at least) and it is very well written, especially since it goes off of only three levels. Yes, you will get that many hours out of three stinkin' levels! Unfortunately it is poorly ended, and while I won't spoil anything it felt like they tried to cram a lot of what could have been another half hour to an hour of story into four minutes, and while it does wrap everything up, it just doesn't work that well. On to atmosphere. The only level where it was really polished was the second, on a ship attacked by Trandoshan mercenaries. It reeks of ""creepy"" and and really helps the build up of what is going on. Now then, time to talk enemies. Anything and everthing will kill you, except regular Battle Droids and Geonision babies. Yes, babies. Super Battle Droids will become the bane of your exisitance and everything you thought you knew about about them goes down the drain (Sorry Battlefront II players, you're done for). Something interesting is how different grenades I had know use for before became quite important to me once I learned what they good against, and I began cursing myself for using them on a Spider Droid and what-not. Overall, this game gave me a very enjoyable experience, and maybe someday I will get around to playing it again.My score: 7/10For as much as I praise this game, the levels did feel a bit drawn out at times, as well as the enemy health bars. But on the other hand, I did kill five geonision babies by electrocuting them into little bits. So thats a plus.			"

												In my own opinion, this game is probably one of the best, if not THE BEST Star Wars game out there. It puts you into the shoes of a leader of an elite squad of soldiers known as Delta squad. You can manuever and order your squad at will with multiple keys for oders. Telling them what formation to be in, or what foes to target. This game is just simply amazing, it has an AMAZING story and amazing gameplay. Star Wars fan, new or old, you definitely need this in your collection. Besides... Screw lightsabers when you have a good ol' blaster!			"

												Star Wars: Republic Commando is a tactical first-person shooter set in the Star Wars universe, developed by LucasArts and published by Activision and LucasArts in 2005. The game uses the Epic Games Unreal Engine.In Star Wars: Republic Commando you play as an elite Clone Commando accompanied by three other squad members through three main missions with submissions included. In the game you investigate hostile areas and search for enemy Intel. You are Delta RC-1138 (Boss, orange suit), the leader of Delta 38 who meet up with Delta RC-1262 (Scorch, yellow suit), Delta RC-1140 (Fixer, green suit) and Delta RC-1207 (Sev, red suit). These elite Clone commandos are created at the clone factories on Kamino. As a squad leader you can order your squad members to attack, defend a position or blow up blockades and each squad member has its own abilities. During your military operations you will find yourself at Geonosis (Rocky desert planet) where droids are manufactured, at the Republic Assault Ship (RAS) and at Kashyyyk (Wookie Forest/Swamps Planet).I highly enjoyed this game because tactical functions and of the HUD (Head Up Display) interface which is built inside the Helmet of your character. Also the weapon designs are well done, for instance the DC-17m Commando Rifle Model which is an adaptable rifle of the Galactic Republic. You can change parts of the gun while in battle and switch a modular sniper- or anti-armor grenade launcher attachment when you progress into the storyline. I also liked the hidden blade (Knuckle Plate Vibro Blade) which comes in handy when you are out of ammunition or just for dealing massive damage in close-combat. The voice acting is great and the interaction between squad members makes the game feel lively. I highly recommend this game to people who like the Star Wars Universe or tactical first-person Sci-Fi shooters with great gameplay, certainly when the game is on sale! "

												After the Jedi Knight/Dark Forces series started focusing more on Lightsaber battles and Force powers (which was eventually expanded even further in the Force Unleashed games) it was refreshing to play a good ol'-fashioned, Star Wars shooter again. The use of Star Wars assets isn't exactly done with the most accurate attention to detail, as the design of the droids and other baddies look very little like their saga counterparts, and the weapons would look very out of place in Lucas' universe, but the gameplay and level design more than make up for it. This is a short-but-sweet, fun, squad-based shooter, which doesn't try to be too clever or reinvent the wheel.It's incredible there was never a follow-up, considering the success of the game and the subsequent success of the Clone Wars TV series (which even featured a cameo by the Republic Commando squad), but who knows, maybe one day...

												This, in my personal opinon, is the best Star Wars game in the entire collection even to date. This game is rich in story, has great character build, and actually has a lot of content for a game that is going on 11 years old. I played this game when I was younger on the original Xbox console, and replaying it on my PC was amazing. I love this game and all its glory even to this date. You should definately play the game.Pros:Story richBeautiful character design and art style (even though the graphics are outdated seeing as this game came out in 2005)Quite a bit of contentVoice actors feel natural and make the funny/serious dialogue in the game so much betterQuite a bit of enemy varietyLocation variertyFunny dialogueCons:Slight glitches with character movement ocasinallySometimes some of the AI within the game don't target you as quickly as they shouldSometimes Delta Squad doesn't listen to comands (happened twice through my entire 8.5 hours)Overall, this game is a ton of fun even today, and the game is worth picking up when on a sale or if you happen to have a spare $10 in your Steam wallet.11/10 Seriously, the game is that much fun.SPOILER BELOW:

												Star Wars Republic Commando is a significant deviation from the previous Star Wars games I’ve played (Dark Forces/Jedi Knight) and definitely a more modern take on the franchise. If you thought it was weird how storm/clone troopers fought their enemies in battle lines like Civil War era musket infantry, you’ll appreciate the “special forces” feel of Republic Commando.The game starts near the end of the second Star Wars prequel movie “Attack of the Clones” where the massive clone army is landing on the Separatist planet Geonosis. While the Jedi Knights and Grand Army of the Republic (clone troopers) are fighting on the surface, a four man group of clone commandos is performing covert actions in the underground Geonosian tunnels and even infiltrating the CIS command ships parked on the ground. You play Delta 38, the leader of Delta Squad, a team of “enhanced” clones who take on special assignments. It’s hinted in the opening animation that even though most clones are genetically identical, the commandos have some sort of physical superiority. You definitely have better firepower.Republic Commando is a first person shooter with heavy squad based gameplay. With a single contextual “use” button, you issue orders to the other three commandos on your team such as door breach, focus target, hack consoles, etc. You can also order team members to use various fighting positions that appear on your hud. This includes sniping positions, grenade positions, and heavy weapon positions. Your computer controlled team has exactly the same weapons that you have, but most of the time they only use the special weapons when assigned to the special positions in the field. There aren’t that many weapons to choose from actually, but there’s plenty of ammo all over the place. This is good because most of the guns can be ineffective depending on who you’re fighting. If everyone has to die right now though, start throwing your grenades. Pros:+A lot of teamwork involved in the single player campaign. In the sections where you’re fighting by yourself you will notice just how much harder the game is without your brothers backing you up. Most importantly, you won’t be revived if you get knocked out, which will happen A LOT. +The game runs parallel to the movie storylines (though movie characters don’t really show up) so if you’re familiar with the Star Wars prequel movies you’ll have a good idea what’s going on. There are three game campaigns: Geonosis, RAS Prosecutor (a spooky abandoned ship), and Kashyyyk (the Wookie home world). This isn’t Call of Duty where your team is a bunch of people you don’t care about. Your Delta Squad brothers are with you from beginning to end.+There’s quite a mix up of enemies to fight and usually you have a bunch of different ways to go about clearing a room. The easiest is usually busting out one of your 4 different types of grenades, but the heavy anti-armor gun is always fun too. You don’t get to control any vehicles like in the Battlefront games, but you can man a few different stationary gun turrets (or order your men to do it).Cons:-The difficulty of the game seems to vary wildly, especially when dealing with enemies who use melee weapons. Sometimes they just seem to cut you down in one shot. This isn’t a big deal most of the time because your team members can quickly revive you, but during the second campaign, those scavenger droids are a nightmare. I get the feeling they’re just supposed to be an annoyance, but they can absolutely wreck you.-I mentioned before that the weapons seem weak, but they might just be more suited for fighting certain types of enemies.  Your blaster rifle is decent against the weak droids and Geonosians but seems to be terrible against everything else. There are a few different guns that you can pick up from fallen enemies as well, but with the exception of a couple rare ones, they’re not so hot either. Get used to emptying an entire clip to kill one enemy.-No co-op multiplayer! A game like this would be amazing if you could go through the game with a team of friends since the computer is already controlling the small team. Unfortunately the multiplayer seems to be restricted to basic PvP.Overall Republic Commando is probably my favorite Star Wars game (so far). It’s action packed with a strong story and it’s not so old that I’m embarrassed to run it on a modern computer. Definitely give the game a try if you can get your hands on it.  "

												The game's capabilities haven't aged so well, but the fun hasn't disappeared at all. The gameplay is fantastic even to this day (though the AI is pretty stupid). Super Battle Droids actually feel like a threat, unlike how they're portrayed within the films and other games/television shows. Characters are all pretty diverse in personality. This game made you feel badass for being the Republic's foot soldier, which is a good thing. It's a shame the story plot isn't really well connected, and I'd love some more continuity between each level.			"

												Star Wars Republic Commando tells the story of The Clone Wars by the point of view of the leader of a elite commando squad from the Republic fighting against the army of droids and mercenaries of the Separatists. With you there are three other commandos that you give orders in field during each mission,such as slicing door,planting detonators etc. The graphics are nothing to boost about,they are what 2005 games looked like in the day,but the music is great seeing as it triggers only in the right moments. The gameplay is pretty satisfaying and it really makes this game the best FPS i ever played.  The only thing i didn't like about this game is how it has a range of 8-10 hours of campaign,which is pretty short. Even more if you consider that the game ends abruptly AND with a cliffhanger,with a sequel that may never be made.			"

Its a shame that there was no sequel following this game but still, definitely worth getting if you haven't tried it. It was games like these that helped me to appreciate the greater Star Wars universe as a kid, and even today the Clone Wars era has a place in my heart. The story is actually pretty good for what seems to be a weird Star Wars title and it was pretty interesting how games like this and the series gave more and more development to these faceless hordes of troopers. The gameplay itself is also quite good and a tad more mature then some more typical Star Wars games of late. Overall, I'd recommend this title to anyone looking for a fun Star Wars games. 8/10			"

												Star Wars Republic Commando is an fps game released in the star wars universe in 2005. In 2015 it still remains one of the best Star War games ever to be created and im trully sad to admit, i didnt appreciate it in its time of release. Back at the time i felt the game was really hard even on normal and i couldnt get accustomised with the various game mechanics. Now that im a bit older (but certaintly not wiser ^^), i came to appreciate this awesome title in all its grandeur.In this game you play the leader of a republic commando team, whose purpose is espionage,sabotage and advanced reconnaisssance. Obviously stealth is out of the question for like 95% of the game but the rest are yours for the making. Your team includes 3 more members each specializing in its own field. You get your sniper, your demo man and your enginneer as well. Throughout the game you are called to make tactical decisions and place your team8s around the field, in order to maximize your chances of survival and win your confrontations. Its sounds easy to do and at first it is, but as the game evolves your desicions must evolve as well.  All and all that was one aspect i enjoyed the most in this game. As with any good fps, you get to use a lot of different weapons and grenades and you can further enchance your own weapons to meet any kind of enemy. From the simple laser pistol to a full rocket launcher, this game has it all and more.In terms of gameplay difficulty, the game is not as hard as you might think, but its harder that most of todays standard measures. You dont get to do rambo stuff, cause you will be facing the ground and w8 for your m8s to revive you and that is really nervebreaking. All the levels have a linear design as well, so you wont miss your next objective. Maybe for most that is considered a down, but i think it works pretty well for this game.The graphics arent on par with todays standards, but you can modify the texture pack anyway you like and you can increase the games resolution as well. On the plus side even if you dont it still looks ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. And as with any star wars game that respects itself, the audio is one of the best things in this game. Everything from the tiniest footstep to the biggest blast has been exceptional and thats something i cant say for most games these days.The dialogues are grimm and funny at the same time and the voices seem to match everyone and everything in this game.All and all i recommend this game to everyone. If you are a fan of fps you will love it, if you are a fan of star wars you will love it even more and even if you dont like fps try it. You will love it too!!!			"

												First thing I can say about this game is that it is kinda hard playing it if you're used to call of duty or any other games that are like it because here your character is the leader of delta squad and you have to order your squad to tactical positions in order to eliminate the enemy. Although the AI is good ordering them to tactical positions makes killing the opponents easier. Other than that the game is awesome and the story line is great. THIS GAME ISN'T LIKE OTHER STAR WARS GAMES WHERE YOU'RE A JEDI OR CAN BE A JEDI. YOU'RE A CLONE COMMANDO NO FORCE POWERS OR LIGHT SABERS JUST GUNS GRENADES AND TACTICS. The graphics of this game is not that bad even though it was released a decade ago. I'd recommend this game for gamers who play FPS who want a bit more challenge and Star Wars fans.			"

												One of my favorite Star Wars games and favorite First Person Shooters in general, an excellent example of what the universe of the prequel trilogy can be when placed in the right hands.  The campaign mission doesn't exactly tell a compelling story (its 3 narrative arcs broken into smaller missions) and the gameplay can be repetitive, but the whole experience is solid thanks to the squad based combat.  It really feels like you have control over your squad, each combat situation ends up feeling like a puzzle you need to carefully strategize with team placement to solve.  I've beaten this 3 times since the original came out on the Xbox and I will probably play through again at some point, highly recommended, even if it isn't perfect.			"

												Republic Commando owns. You're free to fight however you want, tactical or not tactical. Graphics are alright for the time. Music is pretty cool. It's set in the prequel era, so that part sucks. Story is pretty much prequel stuff that noone cares about. Unless you're up against bullet sponge mechs without any sniper ammo, the campaign moves along pretty quickly. Five or six hours. Ten dollars is worth it.

												This is a great game and you should buy it.There. Now that we've got the most important part out of the way, let me explain why. This isn't a run-in-guns-blazing shoot-em-up game. It would be a solid shooter in it's own right even if it was, but Republic Commando more than holds its own, due to the strategic nature of the fights. The positioning of the other members of your squad around the environment (which will determine what weapons they will favour in the firefight) is critical to victory.Take a sniper position further away from the action to provide covering fire?Take a grenadier position to deal with tougher enemies?Get in a turret and lay down heavy fire?Most importantly of all, which instructions will allow your squad to cover each other and achieve the objective?Make no mistake, the fights in this game, especially near the end, can get extremely difficult. You will die multiple times and have to strategise and experiment to discover which tactics will lead you to victory. And when you have to decide whether to take out the enemies in front of you first or sabotage one of two droid dispensers, every second it takes you to reach a decision is vital.With four different weapons and four different grenades (plus whatever extra weapon you can scavenge from defeated enemies), the choices of a head-on assault, a flanking attack or a defensive position become very important and have to be judged carefully.Although some today may consider this lacking due to not being based with co-op in mind, that is because this game is 11 years old, and was made when co-op play wasn't such a big deal. Maybe a missed opportunity, but not something that any Star Wars fan should hold against it.Forget the new Battlefront. This is an excellent game, and I still hold out hope for a sequel or a remaster.			"

												This game is a squad based ps2 era shooter set in the star wars universe set during the clone wars. it's no brothers in arms but the squad tactics are solid enough you can give basic orders and a lot of the time you need to use your squads abilities to continue the game. Besides that your squad abillities can be used in a tactical way. like defending a squadmate while he hacks into turrets to aid in battle, or opening a flanking route with a bomb. The solid squadplay is made better with the awsome AI that is put on display here. i mean this is awsome i have seen my squad heal themselves without being asked. Reviving eachother and deciding to kill surrounding enemies beforehand or not if the enemy is a big thing like a spider droid. The pathfinding works really well and the AI never broke on me once during my entire time with the game. besides that the game nails the look and feel of prequel star wars. There are a varied amount of droids and aliens to shoot that force you to use different weapons and tactics. the music has some shining moments with big orchesteral themes that suddenly play every now and then. This is on top of the expert sound designe that again help to make you feel like your playing a really cool Star Wars game. Also worth mentioning is the banter between the charachters while it's nothing shakespearian it's helpfull in giving the soldiers a little character they react realisticly to your orders. If you for example accidently give wierd orders that would not make sense IRL your soldiers will let you know you messed up with some dialoge. The level of polish is just great overall a game well worth playing.			"

Now that im a bit older (but certaintly not wiser ^^), i came to appreciate this awesome title in all its grandeur.In this game you play the leader of a republic commando team, whose purpose is espionage,sabotage and advanced reconnaisssance. Obviously stealth is out of the question for like 95% of the game but the rest are yours for the making. Your team includes 3 more members each specializing in its own field. You get your sniper, your demo man and your enginneer as well. Throughout the game you are called to make tactical decisions and place your team8s around the field, in order to maximize your chances of survival and win your confrontations. Its sounds easy to do and at first it is, but as the game evolves your desicions must evolve as well.  All and all that was one aspect i enjoyed the most in this game. As with any good fps, you get to use a lot of different weapons and grenades and you can further enchance your own weapons to meet any kind of enemy. From the simple laser pistol to a full rocket launcher, this game has it all and more.In terms of gameplay difficulty, the game is not as hard as you might think, but its harder that most of todays standard measures. You dont get to do rambo stuff, cause you will be facing the ground and w8 for your m8s to revive you and that is really nervebreaking. All the levels have a linear design as well, so you wont miss your next objective. Maybe for most that is considered a down, but i think it works pretty well for this game.The graphics arent on par with todays standards, but you can modify the texture pack anyway you like and you can increase the games resolution as well. On the plus side even if you dont it still looks ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. And as with any star wars game that respects itself, the audio is one of the best things in this game. Everything from the tiniest footstep to the biggest blast has been exceptional and thats something i cant say for most games these days.The dialogues are grimm and funny at the same time and the voices seem to match everyone and everything in this game.All and all i recommend this game to everyone. If you are a fan of fps you will love it, if you are a fan of star wars you will love it even more and even if you dont like fps try it. You will love it too!!!			"

												Star Wars Republic Commando is a First Person Shooter with a tactical twist, to control your squad! Not only does it deliver a solid and outstanding narrative, but it also proves that you can get a connection with characters through numbers. No pre-rendered cutscences needed!Shooting: The game can be tough, it really can. It is in no means easy and the guns have the right amount of star-wars and unique twist. There isn't the biggest array of weapons, and i often found myself sticking with the default commando weapon(s). Oddly enough, these space weapons also have a tiny bit of a recoil. No idea how that works, i just know that i enjoy shooting them.Controlling your squad: It's smooth, yes, but sometimes it doesn't really work because of the odd AI, your squadmates aren't always intelligent and they're often very slow. Luckily, it can be very useful to know where to put them, and once you've put them there, they'll stay there.(Unless you go down and they have to save you.). Overall, it needs a bit more depth, but it works a lot better than most games these days.Your squad: Delta are absolutely the coolest looking clone-commandos in the galaxy! They are familiar with each other and have some rather cool and talketive interactions. People like 07(Sev) is the badass sniper who's not very talketive with a gruff voice and well, a few twists. I don't remember the other characters that much, but that's because i haven't played the game in a while. The AI however isn't that well-developed and often clunky.Conclusion: Despite the lack of multiplayer (RIP gamespy), the weird AI and the short length of singleplayer. I encourage anyone to drop those 10 Euro's on this game. Because it really is worth it. Not only will you remember the game as something that ABSOLUTELY needs a sequel, but also one that needs to be more noticed. In short: The game is great. Seriously, if you haven't bought this game yet, i encourage you to buy it.			"

												A very good Star Wars game from more than a decade ago. The graphics are not so good anymore but that gets balanced with the gameplay. The AI is okay, although the most effort was put into your squad and not into your enemys or your alliesThe main campaign is about 8-10 hours long, depending on your playstyle, and is manageable on the hardest difficulty. Overall a nice little Star Wars Singleplayer game for a low price. If your a Star Wars fan and you want to have a different look at the Clone Wars than you normaly get, buy it, else wait for a sale. 7/10  Would take dead Wookies as cover again			"

												One of my favorite Star Wars games and favorite First Person Shooters in general, an excellent example of what the universe of the prequel trilogy can be when placed in the right hands.  The campaign mission doesn't exactly tell a compelling story (its 3 narrative arcs broken into smaller missions) and the gameplay can be repetitive, but the whole experience is solid thanks to the squad based combat.  It really feels like you have control over your squad, each combat situation ends up feeling like a puzzle you need to carefully strategize with team placement to solve.  I've beaten this 3 times since the original came out on the Xbox and I will probably play through again at some point, highly recommended, even if it isn't perfect.			"

												TLDR: I love this game above all others, and when you're done with it several times, I'm confident you will too.Again, not really good at writing reviews. I will however state that I absolutely love this game.Don't let the few hours clocked on Steam fool you. I only bought it on Steam because it's more convenient than using 2 very worn CDs.I've played the campaign at least a dozen times over the years. Sadly, the campaign is short, but in no way does the campaign length negatively impact the absolute quality of this game.Best squad-shooter I've ever played. Excellent voice acting. Squadmate lines are witty and charming, and the squad is extremely affable. There is no way you will not like all of them, though it is very likely that you'll have a favourite. Mine is Scorch :)And you will experience true loneliness when you and your squad split up on several occasions to achieve independent objectives.Again, I love this game above all others and I would recommend this game to anyone, anyday and everyday, Star Wars fan or otherwise.If you value exellent gameplay, simple yet elegant squad mechanics, amazing voice acting, witty one-liners, affable teammates, dark and immersive atmosphere, brilliant music and everything else that makes an excellent game excellent, you would be severely amiss to let this game go unplayed. And when you're done with it, play it again. And again.One play through hardly does the game justice as it impossible to get take notice of all the gems it offers with just one play through.Infinity/10.""Clone Advisor: Delta Squad, clear that promenade!Scorch: Promenade, sir?Fixer: Shut it, Six-Two.""

												A first person shooter that revolves around the noble clone trooper, from inception to their major actions on Genosis to Kashyyyk (wookie planet) and through galactic ships follow a story as breif and explosive as the lifes of the main protagonists.Republic commando, is told from the troopers point of view, they are all clones but it gives a glimps of the uniqeness that is inherent in all the clone troopers, their kinship and a little of the attention to details that make starwars amazing.Basically, (as played on hardest difficulty) you are in charge of a fourman team, delta squad, of which you are the leading commando and your three 'pod brothers' will be ai controlled interactable teamates.You must fight your way through levels, utilising your team as you go, weather assigning them to cover, sniping positions and turrets to hacking terminals and smashing doors. teamwork is essential and rewarding when taking down enemies to clearing areas.must for the fans.

												This game is awesome!First time i played this game in 2006, and was absolutely amazed, actually still am.There are lot of SW games, most of them about Jedi. I'm not saying that they are bad, but i think that RC is the best for now =)The game is little bit short, graphics for 2014 outdated, and game has few Squad tactical features.But god damn this game has amazing atmosphere, good story line, and really good gameplay.If you are the SW fan or Clones in SW universe, you just have to have this game in your library.P.S. The best location in the game in my opinion is the Clone's Starship ""Executor"".			"

Despite the shortish story it will still have you playing for hours. Amazing graphics, great gameplay, and a still active online multiplayer community (although the real fun is in the campaign.)

												Republic Commando is probably one, if not, the best licensed Star Wars game out there.The game takes place during the plot of Episode 2, where you control Delta squad, and by control, I mean CONTROL them.  While the A.I. is competent to fight on their own, you can mark out certain areas as to where they can hold down a position, place a shaped charge to move on, or even snipe faraway enemies.  And while yes, you can go out and fight without issuing commands, it's not recommended as this game will take you down quick if you don't take advantage of commanding your squad.I've put a lot of hours into this game on the original Xbox, and I plan to put more into the PC version, and even see if the multiplayer servers are still up (doubt it).  Final Verdict:Worth the Buy, if you are a fan of Star Wars, this is a definite buy for your steam library.  Hell, even if you're just a shooter fan, this is a good recommendation, as the mechanics in this game are solid.  So go ahead and try this game out.  You won't be dissapointed.			"

Republic Commando manages to do this without making you feel overpowered and still keeps you on edge with enemies that require extra attention along with spawning pods.  Though the campaign is short I recommend this game.  This is still in my opinion one of the BEST Star Wars games ever created!			"

												Well, whatever people have to praise about in this game has already been posted, and as you can see I recommend this for pretty much the same reasons. Great gameplay, great soundtrack, great experience overall, but yet I really want to warn this to anyone reading this review. The ending is too abrupt, you're led to believe that things are only beggining, that the game is at it's crucial point with a plot twist incoming... and then it ends. I loved the story but I have to admit it was one of the WORST moments to ever end a game, specially one this good. So yeah, you've been warned. Still worth buying though.			"

												Gritty, dark, and a heck of a lot of fun to play, Star Wars: Republic Commando is a first person tactial shooter that finds the perfect balance between strategy and action.Whereas most First-Person shooters take the action route there are still a few extreme tactical and strategy based military such as the Tom Clancy: Rainbow Six series. The Rainbow Six series takes a linear strategy and tactical based approach to military operations. The game focuses on the ""How to"" rather than the ""What to."" The problem with games like this is that they combine the complex strategy with a genre that most people prefer to stay focused on the ""What to."" First-Person Shooters. Therefore creating an issue. You have those who love it because it of it strict strategy focus and then you have those who hate it because it doesn't have enough action. Republic Commando solves this issue...It blends (and balances) the action with the strategy. Featuring a one key strategy system you can command your squad members directly and quickly. No sub-menus, no complicated explanation. Just push and play. One of the games main features is a excellent AI system. And boy is it good...You squad members know how to fight and how to do it efficiently. They automatically take cover and stay focused on the objective. They eliminate the primary targets first and take on the secondary ones later. The first time playing the game through, I found myself dying more than the AI! Now that is good...The gameplay is fast paced, frantic, and exciting. It perfectly balances strategy and action.The graphics are...meh...In their day they were probably amazing. But now a dated Quake engine remains. Don't get me wrong the graphics aren't bad, but by today's standards they are a little old, but acceptable. The sound is good and the soundtrack is perfect. The soundtrack by Jesse Harlin is a great blend of dark overtones, action sequences, and excellent buildup. The sound effects in game sound exactly like Star Wars.The campaign is extremely fun. It isn't even much of a campaign. It is just three big missions broken up into small parts. I have probably played the game's through about 7 times. My only complaint about the campaign is the rather abrupt ending. Now I won't spoil anything but it will leave you feeling like...""WHAT! THAT'S IT! THAT WASN'T HOW IT WAS SUPPOSED TO END! THERE WAS SOOOOO MUCH BUILD UP! COME ON!""Then you will go frantically searching the web to try and find if there is a sequal. And you'll find this: CancelledAnd when your all done you can play the multiplayer! Which is fun, but pretty much dead...So in short this game is awesome. Go get it!Overall Rating: 7.5/10Presentation: 10/10Story: 8/10Gameplay: 7/10Graphics: 6.5/10Sound: 9/10Lasting Appeal: 7/10Overall Rating: 7.5/10Content Review:Star Wars: Republic Commando is a tough game to review in terms of content. While much of the game is dark, gritty, and permeated by death, on has tot take int the account the fact that...well...it's Star Wars. This is (so far) the most violent Star Wars Video Game to date. Thankfully, violence is the only category that scores high in this game, in terms of content.Positive Elements: You fight on the good side. You stand for morals such as teamwork, unity, and justice. Teamwork is essential to success in the game.6/10 (Moderate) Violence: The game is a First Person Shooter, so some violence is expected. What is different about this game game though in comparison to previous Star Wars games is that it features an extensive amount of blood, gore, and corpses. The Genossian bug enemy's you fight break into bits and pieces when killed. If you shoot an enemy up close blood will splatter on your visor only to be removed by a wiper blade seconds later. When shooting at an enemy you can see spurts of blood flying off. Combat is highlighted by screams, cries of pain, and yelling. In addition to all that, many bodies of human clones are found scattered throughout the game.3/10 (Infrequent/Mild) Language: D--n and Hell are used occasionally. Insults like, clankers, and scumbag are uttered with frequency.0/10 (None) Sexual Content: :)0/10 (None) Drugs/Alcohol: :)4/10 (Present) Negative Elements: Death permeates the environment. Much of the game is dark and has a bleak outlook on things. Frequently the Commandos quote from their fake rule book which says things like ""Rule Number 1: Kill them before they kill you.""Other Moral Issues: The weird mystical Force is mentioned (e.g.""May the force be with you."") but never elaborated on. The Commandos are cloned from another human being, as are many of the other soldiers you see in game.

												I remember the first time I put that disk, that artwork of Delta Squad giving me excitement, waiting for this game to finish installing so I could play as a Clone Commando. I was 15, perhaps, maybe 14. Being a Star Wars fan, spending hours playing Knights of the Old Republic, Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy.Got this on a discount a while ago, wanted to have my old games on Steam. - and still, this feels so damn good.Nostalgia isn't a reason to still hype over this game. Republic Commando did define the First Person Shooter genre, combining a Squad-based Gameplay with a Tactical Shooter. You play your cards right, you don't die. Still, many shooters can't reach this level, they can't make a fast gameplay combined with team management in the middle of the combat. This game gave us a choice to place our commandos in the right places, managing our resources between having more firepower and getting the job done. Not the best variety of weapons, sure; still leading a group of four in various scenarios is enough to get yourself in a challange.If anything, it's worth playing for the story itself. Being a ""Deluxe Model"" in a Clone Army, leading a squad of Clone Commandos with different characteristics. Listening to them trashing at each other, commenting on kills and reacting to your actions. Well-designed, well-thought.To this day, Republic Commando is still one of the most feature-rich First Person Shooters out there. Still looking good, still has a damn-good story, still enojyable, still challanging. - Do you like First Person Shooters? Then, this is a must have.			"

I'll admit, though, it DOES feel a bit odd, now, playing it with a mouse.  This game was a console game, and the aiming felt so good with a right stick.  Even with the Steam Controller and its trackpad, the aiming doesn't feel right, somehow.  But, I digress.

The game itself is quite old, and unfortunately has not aged as well as most. However, if you're a die-hard Star Wars fan, a classic FPS connoisseur, or a nostalgia junkie, this is well worth the now discounted price of admission. Multiplayer via Gamespy is dead (and has been for years, as most of you already know), but Multiplayer via direct-connect servers or Gameranger are available (If that's your thing).

I wanted it so bad, so when someone I know showed it to me on Steam, I ran straight home and installed Steam. I do not regret sitting there and watching the install screen for two hours.

												Ah, I love this game. I remember playing it when it was on the X-box, and was is great to play it again.It's a squad based action shooter, with rather intelligent AI companions (Although they can't use any weapons other than the main gun unless in special cover). You play through the game taking place during the Clone wars as a elite squad sent on special missions, and in my opinion it really nails that atmosphere of taking on the impossible odds, as your sent against increasingly difficult hoards of enemies. Keep it mind, it isn't an RPG, there are no real choices or decisions to be made, and there is no multiplayer scene, giving it unfortunately very little replayability other than for enjoyment. It is a fun game however, and offers some of what I feel is the best squad gameplay and teamwork mechanics even compared to newer games today. Worth picking up if you just want to shoot some baddies and lead a commando team.			"

You're the squad's leader, Delta 38. You have the ability to command your troops, whether it be to breach doors or take  up a sniping position.

I've got some spare pre-Christmas dough, so lets give it a go!"" Best 3 bucks I've spent in a while.  PRO   Obviously, amazing price tag. 3 bucks is basically less than a half hour's work at minimum wage.  Solid core gameplay mechanics. The A.I. is reaaaaly good for this time of development, and squad commands and actions are smooth and natural.  Atmospheric environments. Cliche, I know, but this game hits it home on the atmosphere. As a commando, you really get a Halo ODST feel to your character (really bada** but not Master Chief-invincible) (BTW I'm not comparing ODST to this game bc I know a lot of people feel strongly about the game but w/e ok back to main points). For example, on a specific mission you go onto a derelict, abandoned Republic destroyer to investigate why it went missing. As you enter the ship, you get overwhelmed with just how big the ship is. Your squad splits up to cover as much ground as possible, so you go alone into your section of the ship. It's got a nice Death Troopers feel to it (GREAT BOOK BTW).  AMAZING CHARACTERIZATION. So this one is really important to me. I feel like lately I have played waaaaayyy too many games that just throw in characters somewhat relevant to the storyline without actually giving half a crap about establishing who they are, where they come from and how they act. Sev, Fixer, and Scorch (your squadmates) all come from the same clone production facility and program, but they have DISTINCTLY different and memorable personalities. Sev is your deep voiced, hunt-loving, bada** sniper. Fixer is your narcissistic and protocol following technician. Scorch is your curious, optomistic, reckless explosive specialist. Seriously good work put in here. Oh yeah and they don't just tell you who they are at the beginning of the game and then treat them as generic clone troopers the rest. Their character traits and facets stick with you throughout. Streamlined HUD and squad commands. They put in basic controls for your squad (Attack formation, defensive formation, defend area, regroup) that just about anyone with a cheese brain can conquer. They also designated certain cover positions to be used for lobbing grenades, sniping, or AT weaponry, which is a nice touch and a boon to locking down an area. Also, your hud is like actually looking through a trooper's helmet. So that's +1 for atmosphere again.Diverse yet comprehensive inventory. Your sniper rifle, rocket launcher, and machine gun are all variants of your blaster rifle; it creates a professional feel about your loadout. You also have your handy-dandy blaster pistol, which is a good backup. Lastly, you're kitted with 3 different grenades (Thermal detonator, flashbang, and anti-mech EMPs. You can also pick up alien grenades too.). Added on to your traditional inventory, you can pick up elite weapons from dead enemies if they drop them. The hardest enemies to kill drop the best weapons to use. Dope.There's more I could touch on, but those are the basics. Cons would be a slight lack of content and game-time, lack of multiplayer/other gamemode, and sometimes buggy AI but I'm forgiving on that. All in all a great game. I can appreciate the theatrics and core mechanics of the game now more than I could back then, and by heavens I hope that someone someday comes out with a worthwhile sequel to this. If you're a fan of Star Wars, I would ABSOLUTELY reccomend this. The storyline covers some aspects the movies don't, and the ending is very satisfying to the total storyline of SW. If you're not a huge fan, I still reccomend. This game can be really difficult at times, but it's still a worthwhile FP shooter that should be tried out. If you absolutlely hate it, it's still only just 3 bucks (at least right now). 9.5/10 ayy lmao			"

Story is out of this world. the only issue I had is that you see in the movies and in the show that clones could take down a droid in a shot or two, maybe a few more for the SBD but in this, you need to empty at least 2 mags in to an SBD with your blaster rifle before you scratch it. and also those bugs are hard to shoot. shoot in bursts.

												Easily one of the best games I have ever played.When I first played this game I didn't even like Star Wars that much,but this game made me a fan.I get goosebumps only when I hear the game's soundtrack.Gameplay-wise,the game is absolutely beautifully designed.It plays out like a regular shooter game,the guns feel good and you have a decent variety of weapons and enemies.What makes the game stand out,is the tactical element of it.You give orders to your fellow Delta Squad commandos during battle.Knowing where,when and how to control them can make the game easier or harder.Going through the campaign,I never got bored because the game offers enough variety.The storyline is the icing on the cake.It keeps you engaged and makes you love the characters and the universe that they are in.The personalities in the game are fun,interesting and exciting.Even the soundtrack is one of the best in any game that I played.In the end I'd like to express my regrets that we still don't have a sequel for the game...EA please...Sev,hang in there!

It's something different and i would higly recommend. It's got wookies in it. get it. Oh wait one more thing. This game screams, like just crazy loud in your face, 'co-operative'.

												Star Wars Republic Commando (or as I like to call it also, Band of Clone Bros) is the forgotten and underrated Star Wars video game that everybody that loves the Star Wars franchise should play. The story of the game is based on the 2nd and 3rd movies of the prequel trilogy, where you play as the leader of a Spec Ops squad of 4 Clones of the Galactic Republic who are responsible for performing special missions that occure behind the scenes of the Clone Wars. This is a squad based game, where using your squad team seriously will be your road for victory. The fact that you play as a Clone, fighting along aside with a team of other Clones, breaks the monotony of the usual protagonists of a story of a Star Wars game, which tend to be Jedis, Siths or some random bounty hunter.I agree, like the vast majority of people who played it, that this is a good game - but not a perfect one. It has one problem that I felt frustrated about: while the enemy was agressive against you, your squad team will be very weak and will lack agressivness, unless you babysit them all the time. Sometimes, they will just get close to an enemy and try killing them by melee (it reminds me of the Warscape Engine BS that is now plaguing the Total War series...), instead of trying to get to cover by their own initiative. Another problem  that I have with the game is the lack of variety with the level designs: the game is divided only by 3 chapters, which are limited equally to 3 areas (first you fight in one planet, then inside a ship, and then again in another planet). A little bit of more effort from the producers of this videogame could have created more variety for you to be present in another scenarios/planets of the Clone Wars. But I believe this problem to be minor, when you compare to the much more positive aspects of the game.Still, I cannot recommend you buy it at full price (except if your are a Star Wars nerd :P), since it is an old game and it no longer has an active multiplayermode. Buy it only when it´s in promotion.Like many people claim, this game really needs a sequel - where you play as the same squad team, now part of the forces of the eeeeeeeevil Galactic Empire. It would have been a much better sequel to make instead of the disaster that was Star Wars ""BattleFront"" EA (THE GAME IS NOT WORTH OF DESERVING OF ""BATTELFRONT"" ON IT´S TITLE!!!). Unfortunatelly, this game appears to have been forgotten and I don´t think a sequel (or a reboot) will ever be created.7.5 out of 10 "

												A bit difficult, the AI is competent, admittedly the enemy more so than your team. Now, your team are Fixer, Scorch and Sev. You play as Boss. It's tactical, a bit. Order Fixer to pick Sev up off the floor, tell Scorch to bomb a bridge and defend them all simultaneously. It starts on Geonosis, where you have to kill Sun Fac and bomb a droid foundry. Step one was fairly simple. Step to went to hell in a handbasket. The weapon choice is your blaster rifle and your pistol. The only flaw is that some enemies are so armored and deal so much damage it's ridiculous.			"

												STAR WARS: Republic Commando, a video game that takes place between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith, is an ideal example for a STAR WARS game about ordinary soldiers.  Fun, humorous, and unique, its pros outway its cons, but the problems can still pop up.Plot:You are Delta 38, the leader of a group of elite clone commandos working for the republic.  You, along with your team, must do the jobs that are too big to know about and too extreme for a regular clone.  Your team is the greatest weapon you have.  Versatile, yet disfunctional, your squad consist of 07 AKA Sev, a vicious hunter who rarely ever misses, 62 AKA Scorch, the demolitions expert with the maturity of a teenager, and 40 AKA Fixer, your second-in-command and tech head who is serious, yet pure of heart.  They will either cheer for you or jeer at you.  Nevertheless, you four are family, and that's how it will always be.PROS: - Good characters you can invest in- Spectacular wepons- The squad moves and operates like real life soldiers- Very funny catchphrases and jeers- Unique locations- Distinctive weapons- Extras are interestingCONS:- Not a lot of locations- Gameplay takes some getting use to- No controller functionality			"

The levels are beutiful and the enemies are difficult and fun to fight. The multiplayer was underpopulated and yet still enough to be fun. A clever and great way of seeing the militaristic world of the star wars universe. A star wars game with no jedi no force and ridiculous over powerd abilities. However some glitchy AI is prevelent and the lack of a co-op system holds the game back. If this game is ever remade and remade well I believe it could a game of the year award.			"

												One of the most fulfilling squad based FPS games ever made. Republic Commando has an easy-to-use and effective squad command system and is one of the few games where you don't feel like you have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for squad mates. The storyline provides a gripping experience that makes you want to keep playing. It is also one of the few games where you feel like you are actually part of a single unit, acting aas one.  As long as your squad has your back, every operation will be quick, clean, and precise, as it should be.-graphics: 7/10-gameplay: 9/10-Singleplayer(story): 9/10-Multiplayer: N/A			"

												I had this game because a friend shared it with me. I have been a fan of the Star Wars saga for many years and this game is BY FAR one of the best games i have ever played. The first battle makes you see the Clone Wars from a diffrent perspective then we all thought was possible. I hope some day people will look back at this game and consider it a legend as i have. My final verdict for this game is a 10/10 and a must have in your game library. Pros: Clone Wars, Kick ♥♥♥ Clone Commandos, And one of the best action features a Star Wars game has ever had. Cons: None This game  is the Father of every other Clone Wars game...Even Battlefront series. I would deffinantly recomend this game to anyone who loves starwars and the Clone Wars in general.			"

												I'd say this game is worth some of your time. I love the characters (mostly Sev and Scorch) and the gameplay is fun and challenging, yet can be a little repetitive before it's all over. It took me about 7 hours to beat the game on Normal difficulty, , but (MINOR SPOILER ALERT)                                                                                                                                                  when I was starting to get really pumped after the last mission thinking there  was going to be more to it, the game just ended causing my heart to skip several beats out of serious disappointment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I do believe this game deserves a sequel yet I have a feeling that the developers might screw things up such as: making   Delta Squad as flat, generic, and emotionless protagonists or forget them at least. Overall I would give this game a 3.75/5 mostly because of length it has.			"

												One of the best Star Wars games I've ever played! Every aspect of this game feels really polished, creative, and researched (well, as much as you can for a sci-fi setting). It all comes together with the gameplay to make a really immersive and surprisingly original (since it's not just re-hashing something straight out of the movies) experience.First of all, the gameplay. After my first session of this game, I actually had a lot of complaints. The enemies feel like bullet sponges - often times taking entire clips just to down one. My squadmates stand out in the open in view of a strong enemy and stupidly march to their deaths without taking cover into consideration. The reticle for the main rifle is really wide and it doesn't feel ""precise"" like I would imagine a laser weapon would feel. Even when I have an enemy in the crosshairs a lot of shots go wide. However, after my second session these complaints disappeared as I got familiarity with the gameplay. You learn the importance of grenades for taking out the high-health enemies, the importance of ordering your troops around to specific ""maneuvers"", how to hit targets with all the different weapons, and how it doesn't matter that much if your squad does dumb stuff because you can still win encounters on your own. You start to understand the tactical tradeoffs of the different maneuvers and weapons. So, if you find yourself frustrated or a bit annoyed your first time playing, give it a rest for the day and come back tomorrow.You might notice the squad-based tactics and orders system. If you've played other games like that, you might be dreading having to deal with it, but I think that it's done very well in this game. It's really simple, and they do a great job of helping you keep track of what your squad is doing. There's a lot of subtle ways they achieve this and I won't describe them all. You won't really have to micro manage what everybody is doing using all sorts of different keys - you usually just press F2 so they follow you around, and then point at things in the environment and press ""f"" to tell a squad mate to perform a specific maneuver. Because it's implemented this way, it's pretty seamless as you switch between shooting and commanding your squad. Even if you go down, your squad can sometimes manage on their own and come revive you.Anyway, it's hard to be frustrated with this game because of the great quick save and quick load system. It's really fast and makes it so you never have to worry about replaying a section over and over. If you do find yourself at a  spot where you keep failing, there's usually a ""trick"" to the encounter to overcome that spot, accomplished by intelligently using the weapons and maneuvers available to you. It's a nice way to design a game like this - a lot of the encounters are kind of like puzzles, in a way.And all that is just about the gameplay. One of the best things about this game is the detail and the immersion it achieves. I highly recommend going into the sound settings and making sure you max them out if you can, and making sure to play with headphones with the volume high enough. There's all sorts of details in all the little sounds, the writing, the UI elements, the dialogue and one-off things the characters say that manages to not get too repetitive, and lots more that needs to be experienced to be understood.If you like Star Wars games, this is one of the best. Even without that, the game is a fun, squad-based sci-fi shooter. It's actually similar to Halo in a lot of ways, so if you like that game I bet you'd enjoy this.			"

												Quite possibly the best Star Wars licenced game out there in my opinion. I have fond memories of playing this when I was 7 or 8 years old back in the day, and the game has not aged AT ALL. Smart squad commands, challenging enemies, a wide and interesting array of weapons and some of the best voicework in a game I have seen. Its not just a great star wars game, but its a great shooter as well. Highly RecommendedPros-Intuitive and innovative squad commands-Interesting weapons, like the Trandoshan projectile weapons and the DC15 system-Great AI, both enemy and teammates-Brutal difficulty even on normal-Wide array of enemy types, and you even get to see characters such as Yoda and General Grevious!Cons-Pretty short, clocked in about 6 hours-Buggy in some sections'-NO SEQUEL			"

												IT'S GREAT!!!!!! in this you play as Delta leader 38, and lead your troop of commandos to kick the seps down a peg or two, you have a halo style shield that regenerates after being hit and after its depleted, you start to take heath damage. There are heath stations put around the maps, where you and your squad can regain health. Also you can manage what you squad do, who they shoot at, how they move in combat, if they use items, and how your team enters  a room. As well, when you, or one of your teamates dies, they dont die, as such, instead they are incapacitated, and you/they can be revived, so if you die it's not a case ""NOOOOOOOO!"" it's ""PLEASSEE DONT DIE AND SCREW THIS UP GUYS"" 10/10 get the game,  its great			"

												I've only played single player, but the campaign is similar to Call Of Duty in that it is action packed and pretty short (7-9 hours). What it does have going for it is a great soundtrack, the mood, star wars characters, and it ties into episode 3 from the clone wars perspective.From a combat perspective, you manage a squad of 4 elite commandos, controlling the squad leader but ordering squad mates in battle. If you have played Dark Forces, this is the game that you wish that turned into.			"

												A great game for fans of simple, FPS shooters, but it is also a relatively hollow game, all things considered. -The gameplay is fun, and the ability to command your squad is a unique gameplay mechanic. -There are no upgrades, collectibles, or unlockables, and the levels are fairly linear. This can be good, bad, or a little of both, depending on your personal preference.-The story is minimal, but definitely there. The characters are likeable, but relatively static, and the narrative is pretty surface level. The ending is very sudden, and doesn't really give the player much resolution.-The game is very stable, with very few bugs, but the few bugs that can occur were, at least in my experience, very noticeable, though not game-breaking.-The game can be very nostalgic for fans of shooters from the mid 2000s (arguably the peak of shooter games), and the story may be quite interesting for Star Wars fans (I believe this game is still canon, in case you were wondering).-There is virtually no replayability, but considering the current price for this game, the 9-12 hours of gameply you'll get are well worth what you'll pay.-The graphics aren't bad at all, especially for its time.Overall review = 6/10 Not great, but for $9.99, certainly not bad			"
