												It's a game about hitting things with particles. That's your one sentence elevator pitch right there. YOU HIT THINGS WITH PARTICLES.And it works. To a point. It's a really weird game because when it works, when your play and the game come together and you're spinning around this arena with your swarm of particles (hence ""Swarm Arena"") smacking the hell out of whatever comes your way, it feels tremendous. The way the music kinda syncs up with your actions and it feels like you're performing some sort of ballet of particle death and that, honestly, is really, really something.But then you start to lose and a lose state in the game isn't quick and clean, it's the slow removal of your abililty to play the game as your swarm gets wittled down and wittled down. It's not quite a walk of shame a la Ridiculous Fishing, it's more that it seems like no-one could work out how to do this cleanly and fairly and just sort of went ""that'll do"". It wouldn't be such a big sin if it didn't drag the game out and into a state where it's just not, briefly, enjoyable to play. It's like your overriding memory of the last round isn't the bit where you're swooping round smacking everything with your particle army, it's the bit where you're trapsing around trying to keep these two particles going to get a few extra points. It doesn't even feel like clinging on desperately, just sort of ""oh. well.""Nevermind though because Swarm Arena is worth it for the moments where you are THE PARTICLE KING and no-one wants to stop THE PARTICLE KING because THE PARTICLE KING has ALL the particles and he'll particle up your face. Or something like that. Look, it's good except for the endgame bit, OK?			"

												A nice arcade style game for casual players or hardcore ones. Basically, the tiny droids revolve around you that attack and protect you from opposing droids. A pretty good game that anyone can play and play against for a couple of bucks!			"

												A wholly original, free-flowing blend of action and strategy.  Surround yourself with a swarm of drones, guiding them in both offense and defense during fast-paced, focused one-on-one battles.  Elegant, intricate dances that can unfold in a million ways.I'm not going to do it any justice in this tiny blurb, but Swarm Arena is something special.  Lovely glowy graphics and great music round out what I see as a total classic.  It's got online play too!  Why it hasn't caught on in a bigger way is beyond me.			"

												Do not be fooled by the steam store page, this game has fully implemented online play through the steam system.  I bought it for it's gameplay, and still enjoy it for that and it's well done online laddering.Not only are the controls solidly simple, but they also allow for quite a few physics based trickes to be pulled off.  This results in gameplay that rarely gets dull and allows the player's playstyle to clearly show in multiplayer matches.			"

												Swarm Arena is a great concept for a simple 1-on-1 battle arena game that is rather unique. You control a swarm of flying pixel thingies that when in range of your ship can be used defensively or offensively. Defense, forces the swarm to hold its position, providing you with some cover against incoming attacks, where Offensive has a number of modes (shoot, circle) used to push your swarm out to attack your opponent. The first person to hit the other ship wins.The biggest issue I have is the lack of control you feel over your swarm. Despite any tactics you may try, such as seeing an opening to quickly attack your foe, your swarm doesn't move in to attack as you may expect making your chance to hit seem very random. Wrongly timed attacks can result in almost instant loss of your entire swarm leaving you very frustrated and likely to loose the round. There are only a few different game modes to play, and with the age of this title now there is no-one playing online anymore. Unless you have friends who want to play you are stuck with the AI or score challenge modes. Talking AI, this has to be a strong point of the game. AI is tough (very tough!) and smart which is rare to find in a Triple-A title let alone a small indie game, but again due to the poor control system over your swarm this ultimately turns to frustration and not a legitimate challenge. This had great potential but simply doesn't pull it off!This may keep you entertained for an hour or two, but would be unlikely to get much more out of it. I would only recommend grabbing this if you find it on a 75-90% off sale.If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations! "

The standard swarm mode is awesome, but even better is the PVP and the sandbox. Fight other people locally or online, fight a bot 1v1, work your way through infinite waves, or just play with the beautiful particle effects and physics.			"

												A unique physics-based game wherein you control a swarm of semi-independent particles. Your powerup determines how they behave. You simply battle your swarms against the enemy and deplete theirs to destroy the enemy.A blast to play, & certainly very hard to master. Also, gorgeous representation.			"

												A Geometry Wars clone with 'multiplayer' elements. Instead of gaining weapon powerups you search for drone powerups that can attack your opponent('s shield). It's very simple, and not really deep. But somewhat fun if you have a couple of minutes to spare.[Rating: 65/100]			"

												This game is absolutely fantastic. After a while of searching for a multiplayer, fast-paced action game for a great price I came to this gem. The gameplay is fast but responsive and skillful, there isn't a moment where you feel cheated by the controls. There's not a flaw in this game and you could easily kill hours playing this. Would recommend.It's also a perfect price to gift a friend after you learn the skills then kick their butt.. until they get better than you xD			"

												The entire allure of this game is in the high score chasing. It is very difficult to go after achievements with this game as the online multiplayer is effectively dead.Not all is bad though. As far as the actual game is concerned, it is quite fun if a bit simple. It was well worth the 80 cents I paid for it.I recommend it so long as the game is on sale for less than a dollar.			"

												You basically play a little comet which is able to manipulate drones. Either you attack with them or defend yourself vs enemy drones. Once you found out how it works this is pretty fun and really addictive for a indie game. One interesting part of the game is that there is an KI which learns from you. The aim is to train the KI to beat the enemy KI on maximum difficulty. Which gets rewarded with an achievment aswell...Wasnt able to do it, but I wish you luck.			"

												Swarm Arena is a weird action game where you play in a arena against another player or ai. You control a energy blob that controls drones and with those drones you try to kill the other blob. You can pick up some powerups that give you abilities. But even with the abilities you don't have a lot of control over your drones. Most kills just feel a bit random. The gameplay just doesn't feel good in my opinion. It's also another one of those small indie games that focuses on multiplayer with no community that plays it. I would avoid this game.			"

Take control of a virtual organism, develop your moves and become one with the swarm – then the game has only just begun. Swarm Arena’s fresh and deep gameplay is a journey from relaxing aesthetics over mind-blowing action to pure tactics. Be fast. Be precise. Or simply enjoy the experience.			"

												Outstanding game. I have even nostalgia from it, i used to train with Pandora a lot when my internet was down. It's one of those ""easy to learn, hard to master"" games but instead of frustrating when you lose, you just feel challenged until you finally overcome the obstacle in question. I bought the game years after this, because when i had initially played it i couldn't even make Steam deposits. This game deserves its value and so much more.			"
