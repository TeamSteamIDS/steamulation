												This game is a mess... and let me count the ways.1. A broken melee system: Postal, true to the franchise, offers many different tools of the trade to dispose of your enemies. And some of the tools include a sledgehammer, machete, fire axe, and something else I can't remember. But none of that matters because the only one that works is the ♥♥♥♥ing machete. It is extremely difficult to land your blow on enemies with other weapons, including your kick, but it doesn't matter because the fire axe and sledgehammer don't even do any damage.2. Abysmal Gunplay: Would you be surprised if I told you this is the strongest gameplay element? Cuz it is. Is it because it's fun? No. Is it because there's cool weapons? No. It's because guns are pretty much the only gameplay element that functions. A headshot kills any enemy instantly. So, if you don't want to deal with the awfulness of every other tool of the trade, guns are the way to go. And don't bother with the shotgun or the MG. They're both garbage.3. Awful Humor: Postal 2 got it's humor from satirizing both social issues and video game tropes and controversies. Postal 3 doesn't do this at all. Instead, it goes for stupid humor and shock value. Like terrorists dressing up in giant novelty moustaches and sombreros and sneaking across the US Border. Or firing man juice soaked tissue clumps at Sarah Palin in a porn shop full of men jerking it to monitors. And I'll admit, I laughed a few times, but it wasn't because I thought it was clever. Quite the opposite, in fact. I laughed because it was so utterly stupid and random that it just brought out the inner caveman. And that's the problem; Postal 3 is offensive for all the wrong reasons. There are a few times when the developers want to get tongue and cheeky with you. But it's hard to find it funny when the game keeps kicking your♥♥♥♥♥every chance it gets. Sorry Postal 3, but you can't kick me in the nads and then give me a piece of cake. It doesn't work that way.4. What-The-♥♥♥♥ Scale Performance: Do you have a decent gaming rig? Do you have an ultra powerful rig? Well neither matter because Postal 3 is terribly built and optimized. I can run mostly anything on max settings, and yet this game chugs when things get going. And even setting it to low didn't change the performance one bit. It's amazing how you can mess up so bad on an engine designed specifically for non-high end machines.5. It's Linear & Catharsis Sucks: The entire game has you follow a very narrow path of the dude going about his day just trying to earn some money. And, as you continue, you get to make moral choices that alter which missions you do. This would be fine, if it wasn't Postal. Or, you know, at least done properly. I wanna be free to explore the city and do what I want and attack the story at my own pace. When you beat the game, you unlock the entire city to go around and play in. But when you start it you see just how bad the direction really is. They basically took what they made of the city, and then stitched together the other set pieces from missions into the mix. There's no sense of where you're going at all. It's apparent they did not design a city and split it accordingly. They just made random crap, stitched it together with duct tape, and said, ""Here this is Catharsis."" You know it's bad when you walk up to a highway offramp and end up at the gay rodeo. Oh, yeah, there's a gay rodeo too. If you were expecting more there isn't. That's pretty much the joke. Gay cowboys. Harr harr.6. Gimmicky Weapons and Assets: Postal 3 showed off a teaser many years ago featuring the Postal dude driving around the city in a segway. They showed this more in the grindhouse trailer they showed at one of the E3 conventions. Guess what? That segway they hyped so much? It's only used in one mission. Yup. One ♥♥♥♥ing mission. Besides the stupid segway, there's other weapons apart from your normal guns and melee weapons you can use to have ""fun."" There's grenades, the gasoline tank, feral cats with super AIDS (???), etc. And all of these suffer from abysmal controls. Thrown weapons like grenades and cats involve holding down one of the mouse buttons, and then pressing the other mouse button while still holding on to the primary fire button. Or something like that. I don't know and I don't care enough to find out. It's that bad that even after 10 hours of this crap I still couldn't get the hang of throwing♥♥♥♥♥♥ Oh, and the gas tank? Useless. Why? Because it's hard as♥♥♥♥♥♥to pour the gas out over where you want it specifically and it's even harder to throw your ♥♥♥♥ing match on the gasoline you poured out.7. Loading Screens: This game has some of the worst loading screens I've ever seen. Not only are they insanely frequent, but they take forever too. There's a loading screen to start the intro videos. Then there's another loading screen after that to load the menu. The first launch of a map or first time loading takes 1 minute and 40 seconds (Yes, I timed it) to load. After that, any other loading screens take between 35-40 seconds.8. The Moral System: I don't mind if a game has a moral system. What I do mind, however, is when you introduce me to the moral system mechanic, teach me what it does and whatever, and then tell me at the end of the game that it doesn't matter. They try to make it a joke towards endgame with Krotchy (who gave you the tutorial in the first place) telling you it doesn't mean anything. And then at the last level they tell you it actually didn't mean anything. So if you thought you were going to get a different ending mission, or ending cutscene, based on your actions then guess what; you don't. This isn't ♥♥♥♥ing funny, Akella. That is a huge slap in the face to your ♥♥♥♥ing player base. Especially when the moral system was one of the features you boasted about in your trailers and even on this very store page.In short: ♥♥♥♥ this game. ♥♥♥♥ Akella for making it. And ♥♥♥♥ RWS for not making themselves and leaving it in the hands of incompetent jagoffs.			"

												Okay, after finally playing the first and second Postal games, I finally decided to give the third installment another shot. Even after learning the backstory of the game (RWS Inc. hired an underfunded and tyrannical game developer company from Russia to code the game), I decided to give it a second chance. Sure, I wouldn't get all the extra little achievements like I did with the first two Postals, but I'd at least beat the game and give it a fair judgment from that, right?Wrong. I had completely forgotten what it was that had kept me from playing this game in the first place. It wasn't the linear levels (Postal 1 had linear levels). It wasn't the stupid jokes or the weird weapons and minigames (Postal 2 had stupid jokes and weird weapons and minigames). It was the gameplay. Yes, Akeela Software (or whatever they call themselves) had suffered through a Russian economic crash and in suffering fired their competent, cooperative developers and assigned this project to a group of Prima Donnas who not only couldn't correctly string a game together even if it was coming out of their own♥♥♥♥♥ but also deliberately altered the structure of the game against the wishes of RWS Inc. (you know, the people who wrote the game series and own the rights to them and CONTRACTED Akeela TO DO MAKE THE GAME THAT RWS had envisioned!!!). Not only that, but Akeela also refused to release the code to the general public because they didn't want those loyal gamers to make MODs or anything, even though RWS Inc. wanted them to. As a result, the gameplay is sticky, jagged, the graphics go photo-negative after 15 minutes of gameplay and glitches flood this game. For example, I had to restart a level because the game wouldn't let me open a door that was integral to the plot, and the escort mission with the segways was almost impossible. All in all, it kept me from enjoying this game not once but twice, which is a shame, because otherwise, I thought it could have been an enjoyable game. *SPOILER ALERT* For those still interested in knowing, the game pickups where the second one left off: after detonating Paradise, Arizona with a nuke, the Postal dude drove to the next closest fictional town in Arizona, Catharsis. There, a wealthy Ron Jeremy owns and runs everything with a pretty open mind. The problem is that he's constantly being undermined or even flat out attacked by Eco-terrorists, Al Queda, God-fearing hockey moms (led by Sarah Palin...wait...why is she in Arizona?!) and other satirical and colorful characters. The Postal Dude, just trying to make a buck, is given constant choices as to whose side he is on, or at least which side he wants to flip flop to and from. While the levels are linear, your actions do choose the course of the game.   Unlike the last game, the third Postal gives you a Max Payne type of third person layout and aiming system, and you get most of the weapons from the previous game, plus a few new ones like beehives, a shopvac (filled with questionably stained tissues) and the badgersaw. Like I said, it could have an enjoyable installment to the series, but the Russian contractors completely ruined it to the point that RWS Inc. even tells people to stay away from it.			"

MY ♥♥♥♥ING GOODNESS GRACIOUS, what a waste of money, even on sale. not even worth $1.99. This game is absolutely horrendous! The sounds are rancid, the controls are broken, the glitches are nasty, the camera has tourette's, the story is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid, the new postal dude style is so ♥♥♥♥ing ginger, the new voice is something to frown upon, the music is garbage and random, the cast is meh, the menus are bland as♥♥♥♥♥♥ the weapon choice is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥, the frame rate is worse than the Xbox one; need i say more? Not only is this a failure of a Postal game, but this is one of the worst games i have honestly ever played in my entire life. I never in my entire life uninstalled a game 1 hour in. There is not single positive thing about this game at all. It does not deserve the title of Postal and now i can see why Urinating on the Postal 3 case in Postal 2 gets you an achievement. Even Running With Scissors acknowledges that it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game, and that's why they continue to update Postal 2 and pretend Postal 3 is just some spin off.Do not buy this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥unless you eitherA. Want to play a game that is the equivalent to Foodfight! on Heroin.B. Want to play a game to torture yourself from start to finish.C.

												Postal 2 won't go down in history as one of the greatest games of all time. It probably won't even make the average top 500 list. That said, I thought it was very entertaining. When it comes to Postal III, I'm at a loss for words. I'd prefer to write a positive review, describing in detail on how this game improved on its predecessor. If necessary, I could write a negative review, filled to the brim with reasons as to why I believe this product to be a disappointing sequel. Instead, I'm staring into the abyss.The Postal Dude is at it again. After blazing a trail of death and destruction through the town of Paradise, he finds himself in Catharsis. Madcap mayhem and wacky hijinks await as Postal Dude tries to find a paying job. Will you somehow find the light of virtue within yourself? Or will you once again submit to your demons, using murder to solve every minor dilemna? Whatever the case, you're sure to be in for a great time. This game also stars Ron Jeremy and Jennifer Walcott. I'm surprised that Lloyd Kaufman didn't make an appearance as well.This entry uses a morality system. Unfortunately, this doesn't mean The Postal Dude will be helping old ladies cross the street (or into woodchippers). Basically, if you want to be the good guy, you have to abide by the law. Naturally, this requires that you become a police officer, and make the law your own. While this doesn't give you a free pass to endanger innocent lives, at least you're doing your part to make Catharsis a safer(?) place. If that sounds like too much trouble, you can always be evil incarnate. This will result in different levels, and eventually a bad ending, if you don't change your ways. If eternal damnation doesn't appeal to you, there's always the handy taser gun. Non-lethal takedowns slowly add up, allowing you another opportunity to join the force when you complete the level. Unfortunately, the possibility exists that your morality, will be at the mercy of the game itself.While I applaud the writers for their attempt at injecting more story into the Postal saga, things stop making sense very early on. I suppose this can be attributed to the fact that I had to skip stages in order to progress. Let me rephrase that: I had to cheat* just to complete this game. Aside from the high probability of crashes, there are numerous scripting issues. Some doors are scripted to open when an event occurs. For reasons that can surely be attributed to the troubled development of the game, these scripts frequently break. To give an example: Shortly after I joined the force, I was tasked with eliminating the homeless that were running rampant through the police station. Eventually I reached a point where a door was supposed to open, but it didn't. I could see the enemy's guns clipping through the door, but there was nothing I could do about it. I restarted the level, which fixed it. However, there was another door later on in the level, and it had the exact same issue. This happened again in another level, where I was supposed to go to the mall, the doors simply wouldn't open. Unlocking all of the stages in Postal III via cheats is a simple task, but that isn't the point. All that work I did trying to be a good Postal Dude? Gone. Putting difficulty aside, when a game can't be completed without resorting to cheats, that means it is broken.Postal III tends to feel like busy-work. Most of the levels start off with an extremely boring job, which fits in with the story. After a short time, things get crazy when Soccer Moms or Savage Nerds or Eco-Terrorists or ???? show up. This is the point where you have to kill/subdue a certain number of them so that the level will end. Postal 2's strength wasn't in standard FPS mechanics. A lot of the entertainment came from using the sandbox aspects. It was a game designed around finding different solutions for everyday problems (sometimes without murder). With Postal III, almost the entirety of the product involves shooting, and it is very poorly-handled. The Postal Dude can take cover, but it's so ineffective you're sometimes better off standing out in the open. On the bright side, the enemy AI is so bad they're liable to ignore or even forget about you in the heat of combat. The levels that don't require the player to deal with x amount of enemies, tend to be really linear slogs. There are even escort missions, as if players wouldn't have enough reasons to hate this game. Aside from severe technical faults such as long load times and poor performance, Postal III also suffers from awful mechanics. Melee is basically useless. Even the heavier weapons, like the fire ax, don't work all that well. One of the items you acquire is a laser pointer, for leading Champ (your dog) to enemies. It is complete trash. The same can be said about most of Postal III's weapons. There's no real incentive to play with them, because they either don't work, or just aren't satisfying. Typically, the average Postal III play-through is going to revolve entirely around shooting everything. It gets old very quickly. Urinating is no longer infinite either. The Postal Dude can't♥♥♥♥♥♥as much as he wants, now he has to wait for his bladder to refill. Yes, it's probably an unnecessary thing to complain about, but it's still a nonsensical change that adds nothing to the game. Everything about Postal III is worse than its prequel...Everything**.Some of you reading this review might not care about Postal. You might even think ""It's a garbage franchise anyway. Who cares?"" Well, it's just my opinion, but I liked the second game. It was crass, offensive, and sometimes the humor fell absolutely flat. Yet underneath all of the nastiness, there is still a game. Postal III is broken, and is more prone to cause headaches than provide any entertainment value. The multitude of bugs, scripting failures, and generally unfun game-design, make for a forgettable entry in this controversial series.*While I did cheat to complete a couple stages, I didn't actually try to skip any. **The soundtrack is pretty decent.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												Terribad.Nothing like Postal 2, the controls are clunky as♥♥♥♥♥♥ and there are SO MANY LOADING SCREENS. Seriously, there is one stage where its just you in a room waiting to push a button, be prepared for many many one off scenes like this. There is no real explorable world to mess with, its just isolated scenes you do a single mission per scene.The combat, holy ♥♥♥♥ing christ the combat, how do you mess something like that up ? Theres a scene where you fight these crazy soccer moms, but ""making them leave"" is almost impossible as they seem to take 10 fully charged stun gun shots and NOTHING HAPPENS. The vagueness in the combat system and missions are laughable at best and after so long get annoying as hell. This is also the first game I have encountered where the crosshairs are completely useless, so that is another gem of a ♥♥♥♥ up to add to the ongoing list of fail this game has.Just buy postal 2 and forget this game came out until RWS decides to make their own kick♥♥♥♥♥addition to the series instead of this outsourced joke of a ""game"".*UPDATE* Another thing to note: I beat this game in 10 hours, and it only took 10 hours cause i am an achievement♥♥♥♥♥♥who will waste lots of free time on any achieve if its there. So this is maybe an 8 hour game at most.			"

												It’s not fair to say that the darkness consumed me, for it was I who enveloped myself in it, there was no coercion involved, only my own maddened curiosity. Another Postal game was released? Well, the second one was charming in that somewhat difficult to explain way that not very good games sometimes are, and it was on sale for a tenner, what could I possibly lose?Sometimes in the quiet hours of the night, when it seems not even God is there to hear me, I ask myself what I could have saved had I never clicked ‘Add to Cart’. It’s more than the ten dollars, what I lost that day transcends the mere balancing of a checkbook, when I played this game the concepts of love, of faith in my fellow man, the very knowledge of any pleasures I had once known all fled from me in an instant.	I wish I could chalk my dislike of this game up to the awful controls, the movement clunkier than a 50’s movie robot or the aiming that I can only describe as ‘acrid’, like the breath of a drunken pirate manning the cannons of his schooner, the fearsome ‘Nobody Will Ever Love You’. I can’t though, much like an iceberg made of solid human feces it goes much deeper than the surface problems. I didn’t even come across anything that offensive in my two-hour waterboarding session with Postal 3, I know that’s exactly what it’s meant to do, and it succeeds with a lot of people, but it just fell flat. The limp and lifeless writing, which is exactly what it permanently rendered certain parts of my body, is the most grotesque thing here aside from the animations and cutscenes. All of this combines to form some sort of chimera of awful design that leaves an unpleasant taste in your mouth that has nothing to do with the attempted gross out humor involving vacuum cleaners and AIDS infected cats.	In the end, it all just tries so hard to elicit some kind of response, positive or negative, from the player, but much like God on the day this game was released, it simply left me feeling apathetic.

												Postal 3, a third sequel to the cult classic, POSTAL franchise. This game, developed by Akella, NOT Running With Scissors - sees the Postal Dude rigth after a Nuclear Bomb goes off in the previous city, crosses a zombie infested bridge and is now forced to find a job in a new city, Catharsis, where a matter of chaotic events occur.The game features a branching Storyline System ala Mass Effect's Paragon system, but more black and white with it's execution, it does make the game differ greatly with it's content and is a highly welcome addition imo - the rest of the game however... is terrible. It is a third person shooter that barely plays at all, it was built on Valve's Source Engine way back in the day, this game pretty much controls terribly and loosely,  has music falling out of loops, AI bugging out occasionally and much more that just scream unfinished.I should mention I do enjoy this game for what it is (a fan of the POSTAL franchise and the kind of macabre humor it uses) but from extremely buggy set pieces (Doors closing on you halting chapter progress.), horrible performance issues (Game is NOT enabled to properly run on Multi Core PCs and PhysX feature do a LOT more harm than good), spotty AI and just overall terrible loose mechanics, the game is most definately a skip to those whom are not willing to put up with the game;s shortcoming - those being dang near everything else - considering the game is buggy to the point of it being borderline unplayable.

												Rather than repeating every other review on here (either saying it's a laggy, buggy pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ or sticking up for it without any support), I'm just gonna point put the pros and cons of POSTAL III. I personally enjoy this game, but I can see why others don't. Many people ask if it's really *that* bad, and if they should pass on it or not... I think you should TRY it, especially if you're a fan of the previous games. But don't fart around, try rushing through as much as you can - that way you can still qualify for a refund, which you may want.Pros:+A good amount of weapons. Not as many as Postal 2, but more than most games.+Though generally very cheesy, it has plenty of comedic moments.+Goofy brand name refrences. A video game store with a game called Left 4 Bread, a coffee shop called Lotsofbucks or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ etc.+Sticks to the usual Postal story. The Dude is broke, has troubles holding a job, and doesn't get his hard earned cash.+Ability to choose whether you're good or bad (or neutral). This changes both gameplay and story, and gives you different missions.+Pee simulator - part two?+Neat soundtrack. And it suites the game.+Boss fights are pretty solid, and can provide a challenge.+Tons of ♥♥♥♥ing blood and gibs, as well as vulgarity and some dark humor.+Tons of replayabiliy, as usual.+Fun gameplay, though for some people it may get boring.Neutral points (some might see as pros, while others see as cons):N) Not in first-person as POSTAL 2 was But then again, let's not forget POSTAL 1 was a top-down shooter.N) Bizarre weapons, such as AIDS infested cats, a badger that acts as a chainsaw, and a vacuum that sucks up small items and shoots them out (non-leathal, and barely ethical to use).N) You have to unlock Free-roam by completing the game.Cons:-Not made by RWS. Hell, they don't even make money from this game!-Bugs. Big bugs! We're talking tarantulas and genetically-altered cockroaches! You and other people will get stuck in certain spots, game crashes (I've rarely had this, though other people seem to have major issues with that), freezes from time to time, and many more. Some are smaller, and some... not so small.-Lag can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ at times, and the frame-rate can drop to -10 FPS.-Repetitive story. You start your job, you and/or your employer get attacked, you defend the area, the boss doesn't like that, you don't get paid, and on to the next one.-No trading cards.-Since it's developed by a Russian company, the English isn't very good. Poor grammar and what not.-No Rick Hunter, but the new Dude repeats gameplay phrases used in P2.-Physics are all over the place. Sometimes when you shot someone in the head with a pistol, their head will pop off. Other times you'll use a ♥♥♥♥ing machine gun, and they'll just drop dead with no gibs. If you tase somebody then pour gasoline on them, they occasionally set on fire. See what I mean? The physics aren't consistent. -Achievements are glitched. Which ones, you ask? Depends on how unlucky you are. I've heard some people have issues with certain achievements I don't have issues with, and vice versa. Sometimes an achievement is apparently locked, sometimes doing the necessary tasks won't add up. I've spent half hour lighting people on fire, killing dozens of people, but my achievement progress was only 4/50. No, I don't mean 4 out of the 50 remaining.			"

												If it weren't for the fact that this game is an unstable piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥that crashes if you so much as look at it funny, I might have recommended it anyways in spite of its design problems. The game itself is just the right kind of awful to mock and poke fun at, it's just a shame that getting it to work requires no less than sorcery and blood sacrifices.Not even for free would I recommend this.

												If you're expecting anything in this game that is either on par with or improved upon from Postal 2, you will be severely disappointed. If you're expecting a competent shooter with good humor, you will be severely disappointed. If you're expecting anything more than complete garbage, you will be severely disappointed.Seriously, this game just about broke my heart when I played it. At first, I couldn't accept the fact that what I was playing was terrible, because I pre-ordered it for the full $60 and I didn't WANT to believe that it was bad. Regardless, my senses eventually kicked in. This game is the reason why I have a category in my Steam Library labeled ""Horrible Mistakes"".			"

												Let's be honest here. Postal 3 is not a good game. Running With Scissors disowned it, and made it canon discontinuity in Paradise Lost. Paradise Lost is the true sequel to Postal 2, not Postal 3.However, that being said, you can have some fun with it. You may have to turn cheat codes on for that, but regardless, there is SOME fun to be had.And, if I was forced to play either this or Mighty Number 9, I'd pick this. Every time. Broken yet cathartic and mildly entertaining beats mediocre-boring-lazy-overextended-weaksauce-banked-too-much-on-nostalgia-not-fun yet playable any day.Seriously, pick it up if it goes on sale. Otherwise, just stick to Postal, Postal 2, Paradise Lost, and Postal Redux.			"

												Oh boy.Postal 3 is the ultimate example on why you should not outsource your beloved series to some obscure Russian game developer which is composed of total ametuers that also have no money.This game is horribly broken, buggy and just plain boring. It lags a lot because the devs didn't optimize the game for multicore rendering AND it has completely-unnecesary PhsyX effects for Dude's coat, and you have to tweak those settings by yourself if you want to squeeze more preformance.Not only that, the game itself has broken DRM that doesn't work past Windows 7 , and it lacks many of the content seen in the E3 demos circa  20-friggin-07 .No wonder why RWS disowned it and retconned its story in Paradise Lost. This is♥♥♥♥♥♥for the birds.If you are still, somehow, tempted to buy it, I quote RWS' buy now page for Postal 3: ""Includes nothing but Buyer’s Remorse""			"

I played for a short while, to the part where I'm supposed to pick up ""used"" tissues. It was at this point I realized the entire game was going to be like this; they stick you in an area with a specific goal and can't do anything else. It's more like a bunch of mini-games.

Oh boy, is it bad...If you wonder how bad, just bear in mind that even the original devs (P3 was made by...

												the postal game that RWS technicaly dousen't ownI'm a RWS fan, and I respect Vince Desi, so it pains me to say - don't buy this game. if you have to find out what its like, find someone who has it and play their copy for 15 minuets. find a lets-play, do something, just don't buy this game. this is a train wreck and everyone knows it. Unless something changed in the past two years RWS is not even making money off this because of the shady coding house they did business with to produce this. that company gutted the script, gutted the features and hurried the alpha out the door as a final game and screwed Running With Sissors out of the rights to the code. this is an official game but one that RWS can't support and likely a game that they are not making a dime off of. wait for the next chapter of the game because I'm sure the postal dude will dismiss this one as the nightmare it is. Like mario's dream that was Super Mario Bros 2, Postal III might as well not exist in the catalog of this franchise.I do no exagerate in saying that this game is completely broken, unbalenced and not fun. a total waste of $20buyer be ware- This is a steaming pile!

												I'm a huge fan of the Postal series. I have been for a long time. The last game I came across in the series was Postal 3... not even developed by RWS. Confused, but enticed by the ""Postal"" title, I purchased it. What I was met with was unspeakable... Broken movement, awful animations, atrocious voice acting, a lackluster story and gunplay so broken and not fun I just... ugh.. I forced myself to beat this game. Resulted in headaches (I'm serious) rage, (I'm serious) and almost coming to TEARS (I'M SERIOUS) DO. NO. BUY. IF YOU HAVE, GET A REFUND!Edit: I did it on the good path, which is even worse than the bad path, BECAUSE IN SOME PARTS YOU CAN'T KILL ANYONE IN A ♥♥♥♥ING POSTAL GAME. A GAME ABOUT KILLING, WHY WOULD THERE BE A GOOD PATH?!			"

												All in all, the game just feels... disingenuous. It was difficult enough to recommend this game. I was previously under the impression that had this game not been so poorly optimized (multiple crashes, poor hit detection, abysmal framerate during combat), this game would have been perceived as just... okay. However, I had to give my two cents.Pros:*The Soundtrack - surprisingly good. Clearly much more effort went into it than everything else.Aaaand that's about it.Netural Points:*Third person perspective - I personally don't mind it, but it would've been nice to have had the option of having a first person perspective, too.*Corey Cruise as Postal Dude - disappointing to not have Rick Hunter's amazing voice soothing my ears, but Cruise still does a commendable job.Cons:Hoo boy. Here we go.*The Humor - The game made me laugh out loud a few times, but it needed more originality. Rehashing lines and jokes from Postal 2 doesn't make it funny. It feels forced. Also, guys, making The Postal Dude say ""I blame (irrelevant subject here)!"" nearly every time he kills something isn't. funny. The only one that made me laugh was ""I blame Christian Metal.""*No map, arrows, or anything that indicated where to go next.*The annoyingly long loading times.*Poor optimization.*crashes frequently.*stutters every time a new mission starts.*A.I. can be incredibly stupid, especially when you're supposed to protect someone.*The sound is imbalanced. The last mission was nothing but LOUD gunfire. Nearly put me in a trance. Did give me a headache, though.*No Open-world exploration in between missions - Seriously??? This is what made Postal 2 so much fun!*The Story is told in past tense - Kind of hard to explain, but The Postal Dude narrates the entire game and explains what happens next in the story. This is fine, but sometimes it's better to PLAY and not TELL what happens next. Can I please PLAY the scenario out and not have to be bombarded with cutscenes that break the momentum and flow?*Good/Evil karma system, Multiple Endings - interesting idea. good for replayability. Too bad I achieved one of the endings in about 5 hours, most of which were spent wondering where the heck I was supposed to go next. Besides, there's no way I'd want to replay this again. Too much of a chore.Did I enjoy myself during this game? A little. Did I laugh? Yes.Are Postal 2, and Postal 2: Paradise Lost superior to this game in every conceivable way? Oh yes. Heck yes.			"

												This is the edgy annoying teenager of video games. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Even RWS (Running With Scissors, the developers of the previous two Postal games) have dissed this game. You know it's bad when developers diss an installment of their own franchise.

												This game isn't as bad as people say it is. Sure, it can be buggy, and the framerate dips quite a bit, but it isn't too bad.I think most people's problem with it is it's departure from Postal 2. If you're looking for a Postal 2-like experience, don't get this, get Postal 2 Paradise Lost. It's cheaper and honestly a much better product.This game isn't like Postal 2, it's a third person action shooter with a Postal 2 theme to it.So, pros and cons:Pros:- Lots of new weapons and items - such as beehives to throw at enemys- Lost of references to Postal 2 - Lots of items/weapons return, recap of what happened in the last game, and quite a few returning characters- Champ... Champ is awesome- The game looks very nice. Seriously, the graphics are amazing- You can dash - a feature that I wish was in Postal 2- It's amazingly fun to completely trample people by dashing at them- Branching story with different missions for each branch- The art is quite niceCons:- The controls are ♥♥♥♥ing wonky at times. Sometimes your accuracy is really off, and everything is either above or below the crosshair. Also, you can't jump anymore. You can only vault over certain objects while you're taking cover behind them- The framerate dips a lot- The game crashes occasionally- Quite a few odd glitches- The saving system is pretty garbage. Unlike Postal 2 where it was clean and organized, this saving system has your save data all over the place- No difficulty settings. Postal 2 had so many difficulty settings to choose from, so why can't this?- Rick Hunter (The Postal Dude's voice actor) isn't here for this game. Instead, they have Cory Cruise substituting for him. Cory does an alright job, but it isn't as good as Rick, in my opinion- The inventory is a cluttered mess. In Postal 2, everything was organized into catagoriesPros or Cons? - These I'll leave up to you to decide:- The game is in third person now- The game is much more linear. Postal 2 put you in an open world with some objectives to complete around the map, while Postal III is linear and mission based.- The soundtrack is pretty good, but often times very oddly unfitting- The distastful humor from Postal 2 is back, and ramped up to be worse than beforeI haven't played the game too much yet, but honestly I feel like I've gotten the full experience from just my first 2 hours of gameplay.So far I've enjoyed the game, but I'll let you weight the pros and cons and make a decisions for yourself.Also, rather than paying for it and giving Akella more money that they don't deserve, just email Mike J of RWS asking for a key. He's often pretty generous with them.			"

												Honestly, do the world a favor and buy postal 2, not this. However, if you like the idea of modding, postal 3 is quite easy to alter, that's literally the only upside. As quite frankly the missions are awkward as sin, awkward aiming with weaponry and incredibly clunky melee combat. But then again the clunky melee combat is a GIVEN, it's source engine afterall folks.Honesty time: Only purchased this to mod it to recreate / attempt to remake postal 1 or 2 features in it.			"

												I'm gonna get a lot of hate mail for saying this, but, I really enjoyed Postal III. It still had the RWS spirit even if it was mostly touched by another developer. There were the big flaws such as being buggy, wasn't as Open World, and yes, I wish there was some way Rick Hunter could've voiced Postal Dude (he did in the beta Postal III interestingly enough). However, the game did offer some interesting gameplay mechanics, its crude humor did get a chuckle or two out of me, and it did (for me) feel like a Postal game. In the end, its definitely not as great as Postal II, but still a decent game that I would play again. Too bad we'll (probably) never see any Mac/Linux ports...			"

												I loved Postal 2 and heck I even enjoyed the Uwe Boll film. But this game kind of sucks to be honest. It has some enjoyable moments here and there but most of the time it just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. The AI can be very annoying most of the time. For example. the mission where you have to escort the slave to City Hall. Every time I shot a paparazzi he would run back and I would have to hit him just so he can follow me. There are also a crap ton of glitches. In the same mission the slave would always get stuck trying to pass through a doorway. I would have to shoot him and keep saving so I can restart. The voice acting was sub par at best. It feels like no one really wanted to be there. I might continue playing the game but that's only because I payed for this and because I loved the second one. I wouldn't be surprised if I just stopped playing because I have better games.			"

												As a Postal fan, I was surprised to see this wasn't actually good. I got to the second mission, where you have to use cat nip spray to get a bunch of HIV cats, however, there was a few problems.1: When a cat gets latched onto you, you have to spam left and right mouse to get it off. This wouldn't be a problem, but if you have the cat nip out, you can easily press right mouse, which consumes a ton of cat nip that's needed for the mission. Yes, it's limited. No, there are no refills (not as far as I could see)2: The Chinese gang never stopped attacking me. And this is the second level, where my only weapons are cats, cat nip spray, and a vacuum. They had pistols, machetes, and M16s. Little unfair. Also, they never stopped respawning, leaving little time for me to grab the cats. I ended up having to throw a cat at one of the guys to grab a machete, which took some time. Which brings me to point 3.3: Some weapons are broken. My favorite weapon from Postal 2, the machete, is reduced to a useless toy. The main attack took many attacks, and throwing it like a boomerang was hard. The machete wasn't thrown at the crosshair, rather below it, and even then it would miss a ton of targets. Also, it got stuck often, even when thrown in an open space.After dying 3 times, the game crashed. I was dissapointed in this game. The gore is better than Postal 2 in my opinion, but there's so many glitches and the game is unfair on the earliest levels. Although, I'm probably one of the few who's okay with the new voice actor (mainly because Akella actually offered to have Rick Hunter voice the game, though he refused) and while some lines were pretty funny to me (""I blame pacman."") some lines pretty much made me cringe. (""Bacon bacon bacon!"" and other fire related lines) I also think I heard him say a really old meme (the cheeseburger one) but since this game was made in 2011 I can excuse that.If you do plan on getting this game, turn off motion blur at the start. It'll save you a lot of headaches. "

												It's not as bad as everyone says, it's just not worth 20 dollars. I personally enjoyed Postal 3, yes it's not POSTAL or POSTAL 2 but it's still a blast in it's own way. To actually describe the game I'll say it's your typical modern mature third person shooter (Like Gears of War and it's clones) with a extremely punishing morality system. As for steam support I've seen everywhere most of the achievements are literally impossible to get due to bugs,glitches,or horrible game making; but hey this game is notorious for a reason! Yeah it has a handful of performance issues (glitching,bugged npcs,freezes) from time to time but it's often so few and far between. I've been able beaten the game numerous so it is playable.

												Old Review:   Well, I'm kinda suprised, I really like Postal lll. Oh, don't get me wrong, Postal 2 is better, but lll is a decent sequal. The branching paths for the story line is neatly implemented, since your actions determine the outcome, not just a prompt. Not hearing Rick Hunter as Postal Dude is pretty weird, but the new guy isn't a bad voice actor. Rick Hunter IS better, but the new voice is pretty decent. Gameplay works fine, though melee is pretty weak. The trademark humor is thankfully still there too. There are some sound issues, but it doesn't ruin the game or anything. The music is loud, but you can turn it down if you need to. Honestly, I urge people to give it a chance. It's not GOTY material, but it's a good time.Revision:   Postal III, upon further reflection, is an awful game. Must of been denial that I payed twenty bucks for a mediocre game that blinded me. I've had a little bit of fun with it, but it is a terrible game. Hopefully Postal 4 ends up being awesome (and considering RWS will be the ones working on future Postal games, I'm pretty sure it will).			"

Short ReviewPostal 3 is not a masterpiece and isn’t as good as the second one, but still enjoyable if you like the Postal series and don’t mind buggy gameplay and an occasional crash, consider buying the game on sale.Overall Score: 62/100Extensive ReviewRight off the bat, I love the Postal games for being violent, funny and because the Postal Dude is an epic protagonist. If you loved Postal 2 and want more, Postal 3 is probably right for you. It is by far not as good or as bug-free, but entertaining none the less. Get it when it is on sale, because it sadly isn’t worth the 20$ they want. I got it on sale and regret nothing.Campaign & StoryIt is a lot shorter than Postal 2 but instead offers different branches based on your actions during missions. This means you can replay the game a good 3 times and will have new content or at least a different story. The narrator and characters are funny, and the dialogue fits the Postal series nicely. The cutscenes have an annoying film grain, but are still funny. The story is not meant to be taken seriously and progresses nicely. But let’s face it, we play Postal to kill people and not to evaluate the Dude’s life choices.Graphics & PerformanceHere is where the game is weak. Many others report crashes, poor frame rates and bugs. I experienced that as well, but if you are patient (not mashing your mouse when the game freezes for a sec) and change the settings to suit your system you should be fine. I did not run the game at ultra settings because programming wise it is not optimized and sometimes the animations are poorly integrated. Movement controls and aiming are not ideal, and some maps or many enemies might lag at times. Loading screens are long, but that might just be my rig. All these performance issues DO NOT take away from the game being fun and enjoyable. If you are willing to live with some issues you can still have a blast with Postal 3. It ran fairly well and smooth for me for the most part.Gameplay and ExperienceThe gameplay is okay and you get used to it not being great quickly. Movement and looking work fine, and the NPCs are responsive (not as good as Postal 2, but still fun to kill). They used some similar voice actors or audio files and many references are made to the previous game. There are plenty of weapons to choose from, including a freaking badger and angry bees. You can urinate, incinerate people, and ride a segway. Overall it is fun and the gore is nice as well. It is different from Postal 2, and if you keep in mind that essentially a team of fans made this with the source engine, any “disappointments” won’t bother you. The achievements are bugged, but you can get a good 70%.ConclusionIf you love the Postal series and this game is on sale, go get it. It is fun, silly and amusing for a piece of garbage. If you can look past some performance issues, this game is great! Seriously, I enjoyed every minute of it but get it on sale. If you don’t like it then it’s 5$ gone and not 20$. I highly recommend it to Postal fans. I regret nothing!			"

												this is a great game its not as bad as that everyone says it is if you find this game bad heres the reason:""Postal III didn’t turn out how RWS had hoped. The original plan was for RWS to do game design and style art, with Akella responsible for production (coding, game art, audio, playtesting, etc.). The project started out great with both groups working close together, then the first blow came with the Russian economy taking a hit and Akella lost their A development team and the project got moved to Team B. Looking back now we should have canceled the project then as there was no way the new less qualified team was going to be able to deliver a “A” quality game."" - RWS official tumblr page  "

												If you really love the Postal franchise you'll love the humor and enjoy the characters and you WILL have fun.  It's dysfunctional and wrong, nothing is sacred and that's all that matters. A couple new weapons are a real winner (badgersaw, beehive) and the missing anthrax infected cow heads and missing taliban WMD rocket launcher is a real bummer. Half the fun I have with Postal 2 is the AFFECT of a biological agent trap or the automatic spreading of sick on a populace as postal dude stands by, innocent. I missed people running up to stop near me and say ""I..."" only to begin vomiting blood and die - because of some devious mischief I had nothing at all to do with, I promise. Postal III lacks this depth of game play. It is somewhat linear.  Not completely on rails, but not free. But when you've got Ron Jeremy, Sarah Palin, Gary Coleman's face, Osamma Bin Laden, homo cowboy thegway biker gangs, Krotchy and all the racism and political jokes you could ever want just waiting for you...you would be cheating yourself to not at least give this game a try. I got the game and played it through and I regret nothing.			"

												I'm going to recommend this for one reason and one reason only:This game is a meme at this point.Running With Scissors have made numerous jokes and criticisms of this game in the media and in their games. The true way to understand how reviled this game is, is to try it yourself.This being a meme however does NOT make it a good game. In fact, this is a very lackluster game. I'll list some of the reasons why.-The melee hit detection is plain horrible-Its stuttery as hell-The numerous loading screens are unbearable-The missions are repetitive and they aren't funThose aren't all the things wrong with it, there are many more.Normally I wouldn't recommend something like this, but it is a POSTAL game after all and, believe it or not, I would recommend you get it to complete your POSTAL collection. It helps you to appreciate Running With Scissors' current agenda and to me it makes all the Postal 3 jokes a lot more funny.Oh yeah, there is a mod that makes it not terrible coming out soon too, so that is another reason to get it.

												Not nearly as bad as everyone says, it's damn fun actually. After all, Postal 2 was nothing like Postal 1.It may take a while for you to get to the great Run N Gun action this game offers, but it's there.Some of the eralier missions can be boring, but if you know what to do they'll fly by.Hell, there's even an in depth choices to give you branching quest lines. I'd suggest dodging between them to get the maximum gameplay value. Twenty dollars is a little pricey for something the devs don't support anymore, but if you're open minded it's worth a try. Pretty original with it's wacky story, even if some of the humor falls flat. Such as over usage of the word ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the stupidest of ways. The duded may not be just like his old, asocial asexual self from the last game. but he's still pretty good. Now he's a white-trash meme loving dead beat with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ luck. He's deffinetly more layed back and not much of a psycho.The game has great music, even if it does end up looping a couple times in each level, but it's mostly one song for each level so it's pretty good. Oddly serious and good music on the tutorial, fairly surprising and uneeded.The game is crappy yet incredibly fun, and it know it. Almost has a saints row 3 feel, with how it doesn't take itself seriously. It has a lower-class outsider dark humor to it, which works in its favor. Honnestly, as a white-trash dead beat I find the postal dude relateable for the most part, with how he's scorned by everyone and's always an outsider.Over all, the game is a 7/10. Not a huge winner, but it's pretty dang original.Also, I became god of the tabby-cats. By the end of the game, I had about thirty of them. This makes me very happy, considering I choose to save them all, hoping I could make them my army.			"

												One Word...HORRIBLE.The fact that this game wears the name Postal is a disgrace.Everything you loved about the Postal franchise gets♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by bad Russian developers who took in fact many years to create this broken crap product. It was also released way too early. Thanks to a Russian publisher which went for the money. I hope Akella is dead. RWS got pretty much ignored when this product was created. Also Akella and the devs left the product to die. Not even a proper source code has been released. This makes it nearly impossible to fix or mod the game. There are a few decent mods though. The game is so bad that many game functionalities are simply not working like melee weapon hit detection. To this comes bad performance and crashes. Story and gameplay wisely this product is a joke anyway. But I personally dont waste my time with this product and you shouldnt neither. Buy Paradise Lost instead. Or wait for Postal 3 Unreal. A Postal 3 remake in the unreal engine. Remade from scratch! Also there is Catharsis Reborn. Some sort of remake/sequel/alternative game in the Postal 3 Source engine. They might be able to create something good with it. Also we might be getting a proper patch once, but I doubt it. The game would still be bad for a Postal game, even if its fixed and bugfree.I waited so long for it, but it was just crap in the end. Sad story...My Rating? None, I simply dont want to rate a broken alpha product. Not worth it.If you really need to try this game, get it somewhere ""free"" or get a very very cheap key.Sometimes RWS also gives some out for free, as demonstration how bad the game is.Im honest, I didnt finish the game. I guess some years ago I made it to the half with tons of crashes.Recently I got the Steam version for a cheap price. Its nearly as bad as it was when it was released.I simply cant bring myself to play this♥♥♥♥♥♥to end. Seriously. This game rapes me, I demand injury compensation!Positive:- Partly nice art design- I partly like the ""evil"" twin Postal Dude's design and new voice, cool that it was reused in Paradise LostNegative:- Bugs and crashes- Perfornance problems- Sound mixing problems, too loud, too quiet, missing sounds, unfitting sounds- Melee weapons have a hit detection thats probably the worst ever- Unifitting unpostalish humor- No free roam- Boring repetitive missions- Trash, bad sort of trash- Bad English grammar and text- Russian quality in general... + Akella sucksIt may could have been a good game if they let RWS help with the developement. But instead there was silence between both devs and Akella just made it worse with fast releasing it. This was the death for the game.RWS regrets this game a lot and I doubt that there will ever be something like this happening again.			"

												Postal 3... oh god Postal 3. I should have listened to the reviews!Short Version: Don't. Just don't. Buy Paradise Lost for Postal 2. It's the sequel Postal 2 deserved, even if it is just DLC.Long Version: I love the Postal series.  I remember first buying Postal 2, and being unable to stop playing it. The sense of humor and the open world gameplay was amazing. Then I saw the screenshots for Postal 3, and thought ""Hey! This looks awesome! And it's made with the Source engine, which was the engine that was used to create amazing games like Half-Life 2, Portal, and Left 4 Dead!"" and without reading the user reviews, I purchased it. My first immediate problem with the game is the loading times. First, to start the game, you go through a loading screen. That alone is pretty normal with Source games, but this one doesn't last 10-15 seconds, it lasts several minutes! Just to load the menu screen! Then, once you've started a game, you have to go through ANOTHER loading screen that also lasts a few minutes to load the level. Every loading screen is like this, and I'm almost certain that I've waited for the game to load more than I've actually played it.The second problem is that the game is buggy. Very buggy. This is one of the most broken games I've ever played. In the time I've played, the game has crashed so many times that I lost count at about the fifth time. If your game is unplayable, then don't release it for gods sake! Third, the gameplay itself is flawed. Even if we look past the technical problems, the gameplay still ranges from mediocre to terrible. There's a mechanic that tracks everything you do. If you do something bad (For example, killing an innocent bystander), you become more evil. The more bad things you do, the more evil you become. This would be fine if it was excecuted well, but the way the system is set up, you can't do anything FUN. You can't do the things you did in Postal 1 and 2 because it has an impact on the story. Even if you could, there's not much to do other than kill people. Also, the world is small compared to the world in postal 2. How can you market your game as ""Open World"" if your world is barely oepn? Oh, and the melee weapons are garbage. They do very little damage, with the exception of the machete.In conclusion, this is one of, if not the worst sequel to a classic game I have ever seen. You thought Duke Nukem Forever was bad? Well, at least Duke Nukem Forever was actually playable and somewhat entertaining, even if it is disappointing for something that was in development for over a decade. There is one positive, though. Because Postal 3 was made with Source, it is very moddable. So, if you're a source modder who wants to remake Postal 1 or 2 in the Source engine, this is a good foundation. If you're not a modder, and don't want to mod this game, then avoid it like the plague.			"

												I am uncertain if it is a joke or not, but I found it to be a terrible game.  It tries to play up as many jokes as it can about the history of the Postal franchise and how vulgar it can be, but part of the endearing peice of Postal 2 was that is was an open world.  This is more like a hallway where you just get to do something disturbing, instead of causing a city block to devolve into a blood bath.  Postal 2 was a great game, let us forget that this was even made.			"

												So ♥♥♥♥ing disappointed in this game. Don't get me wrong, I loved the first two Postal games but this one is hands down one of the worst games I've ever played. It's Sonic '06 level bad people. Basically the game throws you into 3-4 minute load screens and that's not even the worst of it. Sure, you can run around and kill whoever and whatever you want, but the missions are all, and I mean every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ one, is a kill this many people or keep this many protesters at bay. There's nothing else to this game.Still want to play? Enjoy the worst voice acting I have ever seen and somehow, the graphics look worse than Postal II. The gameplay and weapons are all grotesque, and not in a good way. The ""sick humor"" is about as sick as my dying veteran, grandpa, bland and just lies there laughing to himself like a four year old that finds the word ""booger"" to be the funniest thing ever. Can't believe I wasted my money on this and I wish I could get a refund and afford to see a therapist about this game.			"

												Really disappointing. Coming from a fan of Postal 2 and all it's episodes, you'd really expect Postal 3 would be the sh*t, right? No! They went reverse on a big stick. If it wasn't for the graphics (which is something I don't care much about in a game) you could say it's the worst of them all (if you judge each one by it's place in time, it is). It's bad to a point I will take reviews on Steam seriously from now on, in order to try saving myself from wasting money. I can't say there is much of a plot in the game. You just start on some radom shootout with minimal context and try to survive and complete the objectives. You have less weapons, the structure and elements rely too much on Postal 2, the Dude's voice is not the same, no flying scissors,   snipers, kicks to the face, and yeah... no more crack smoking! If it's on sale and you want to try it yourself and regret it later, go ahead. But if it's full price, definatelly not worth it			"

												I love humor and some ideas in this game (soundtrack is quite good too) but, well, too many things are f*cked up. Stupid AI (espessially in escort missions), a lot of bugs, crashes, outdated graphics, cover system which doesn't help in any way, collision system, tiny city, police which doesn't really give a f*ck (if you kill something about 20 people a few policemen will start to chase you and if you kill them... that's all), good path (really?) which is boring as s**t, aiming... Do I really need to mention more? It's quite pity... Oh, it doesn't even work on Windows 8.1 by the way.EDIT:Well, I found a way to launch this s**t on Windows 8.1 but still, all other things I mentioned aren't fixed (and most probably won't be).			"

All cutscenes (even uif you skip them) are annoying.I was realy looking for a good time in Postal 3 and haveing some fun listening to all the critical comments and events.I am sorry to say but Postal 3 sucks.

												This game was SO MUCH FUN!!! Of course though there are some glitches here and there, and the game messed up on me a few times but the point is I had a lot of fun.People say it's a bad game up and down and I loved Postal 2 and the movie so I wondered. ""How bad can it be?"" So I got it when it was on sale, Played the whole game, and got the good ending. When I finished it and got returned to the main menu I smiled sense it was, as said, SO MUCH FUN!!! I thought. ""Why on earth does this game get so much hate?""Then, I freakin' realized it. Postal 2 and Postal III are completely different! Number two was a first person shooter where you could explore the whole town, do what ever you want, had crazy fictional weapons, and had a story that you can not change. Where as Postal III is a third person shooter where you go from mission to mission with no controll, the story AND mission are changed by the choices you make (meaning not only you get a different story but you do different missions), had different guns and weapon types instead of crazy weapons (but there were some weird weapons like the aids infected cats you can throw), and the ending is changed NOT ONLY by the choices you make, it is also changed depending on if you where a bad guy or good guy. For example, if I went through the game murdering bystanders and only using my guns I would get the (not gonna tell you which ending you get if you do so :3), but if I went through the game not hurting bystanders and tazing the bad guys who don't have guns I would get the (Still not gonna tell you which ending you'll get if you do so XD).Hope you read all of this and made your choice on if your going to get this game or not.P.S. If you do get the game, just remember that you should save a lot so if your PC can't let you play it with out exiting you out of it every few hours (like mine did :P) you won't have to restart levels... or worse... have to replay the mission before the one you were on...

												So, in my opinion, Postal 3 isn't that bad of a game. It's funny, I laughed a lot and had a fairly decent amount of fun while playing it. There's a very funny story which made me laugh plenty of times. Maybe I'm a little biased because P3 was the first Postal game I ever played (back in 2012)  but I really enjoyed this, just as much as I enjoyed the other Postal games. However, that said, there were some problems I had with the game. Problems with Postal 3:-RWS made a (really good) playermodel for the Postal Dude. However, late on in the game's development, the Russian devs removed RWS' Dude model, and replaced it with a different model. This♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, cus the one RWS made is a hell of a lot better, and actually LOOKS like the Postal Dude. (pic of RWS' Dude model here: http://imgur.com/a/OHAC6 )-Multiplayer was scrapped, again fairly late on the game's development. This sucks, because multiplayer would have been a lot of fun, especially with all the crazy weapons. Plus, RWS apparently made the multiplayer maps for P3, so it seems a shame that they'll never be seen. So yeah, that aside, Postal 3 is a pretty fun and funny game. In it's current state, I'd give it a 6/10. Had they added/not removed the things I listed above, I could give it a 7/10. If you like the crazy sense of humour Postal has, this is worth a buy. If you don't like RWS' style of humour, this game probably isn't for you.Also you can shoot Uwe Boll lol, its hilarious			"

It isnt worth much imo but was a unique experience and a good topic for any bad video game analysis speech or paper.			"

												In all honesty I don't get why people hate this Game so much. I mean sure, it isn't as good as POSTAL 2 (Far from it in fact) but it's still a pretty damn good Game regardless and has some great jokes. I'd say you should buy it and see what you think and if you don't like it then refund it. Fans of the last Game should know that this doesn't play anything like the last Game. POSTAL 2 was an Open World First Person Shooter and this is a Linear Third Person Shooter (though it does have a branching storyline with 2 sets of Missions that you play depending on whether you kill bystanders and allies or not) so don't just go into it assuming you'll have fun because you liked the other Games in the series, you might not. I personally did though, so why not go ahead and check it out for yourself?			"

												(English)Postal 3A wonderful example of what happens when you trust the game of left-wing uncles and aunts from Akella.I can't understand why RWS did not do the game themselves,and in fact sent her to the slaughter.ConsThe third person - I think that first-person postal 3 would look much better,but no,Akella decided.You stupidly can't get a fist in the ♥♥♥♥ing face.Voice - not that she odnogolosy,during a conversation even begins some kakafoniya:Hiss,crackles,distortion,white noise,short on the ears gives a very good.Mavrodi - Yes,they added that clown into play in order to advertise his new Scam ""MMM-2012"",maybe I'm exaggerating,but other reasons I do not see.Remember the 90s,when Mavrodi ♥♥♥♥ed half of Russia ? It could be repeated,because the browser game.Crappy weapons - don't Even try to use something other than firearms.While you aim with the pointer in the hope that Champ will bite the enemy eggs,you will cut into the salad.Stupid AI - That you ran over the enemy,I think he will shoot at you ? No,it is stupid and will rise to behold the walls in this game.ProsMusic - the Music is surprisingly good(Except for that lullaby on the bridge at the beginning of the game).In General I REALLY do not advise to play this game just murdered.By the way Akella wanted to take away the rights to the series RWS.Cool right ?Horror. Where the old Postal?(Русский)Postal 3Чудесный пример того что будет,если доверить игру левых дядям и тётям из Акеллы.Я не могу понять,почему RWS не сделали игру сами,а фактически отдали её на убой.МинусыВид от третьего лица - я считаю что от первого лица Постал 3 выглядел бы гораздо лучше,но нет,Акелла решила по своему.Вы тупо не сможете попасть кулаком по eбaлу.Озвучка - мало того что она одноголосовая,так во время разговора ещё начинается какая-то какафония:Шипение,скрипы,искажение звука,белый шум,короче по ушам даёт очень хорошо.Мавроди - Да,они добавили этого клоуна в игру,дабы прорекламировать его новую аферу ""МММ-2012"",возможно я преувеличиваю,но других причин я не вижу.Помните 90-е,когда Мавроди нaeбал половину России ? Это могло повториться,ведь лох не мамонт.Дepьмовое оружие - Даже не вздумайте пользоваться чем-то кроме огнестрела.Пока вы целитесь указкой в надежде что Чамп откусит противнику яйца,вас уже нарежут на салатик.Тупой ИИ - Вот к вам подбежал энеми,думаете он будет в вас стрелять ? Нет,он тупо встанет и будет созерцать стены в этой игре.ПлюсыМузыка - Музыка на удивление хороша(Кроме той колыбельной на мосту в начале игры).В целом я ОЧЕНЬ не советую играть в это,игра просто убита.Кстати Акелла хотела отобрать права на серию у RWS.Круто правда ?Ужас.

												Bought it for a few bucks, thought I'd check for myself what all the hatered is for.Is this a good game? No, not at all. It's unfinished, it crashed several times while playing through the story, melee doesn't really seem to work all that well, pee doesn't collide with the characters in the world like it did in postal II, the rpg blows up in your face unless you charge it, the game uses assets from half-life 2 because they couldn't be bothered to replace them and the missions are monotonous and repetitive.The game is now in a forced third person pespective and they replaced jumping with some crappy cover system I never found any use for, atleast the movement animations are nice.On the plus side gunfights are actually quite enjoyable in this game, good sound effects, nice visuals and very gory, fps drops a little sometimes because the source engine just can't handle lots of npc's in combat, the story did give me a good laugh every now and then and the new Dude voice does an okay job aswell.Still can't recommend it though, it feels more like a postal themed half-life 2 mod than a worthy sequel.

												I played postal 2 many many many times through. The open world gameplay and funny easter eggish type gameplay was a lot of fun. You could follow the story or just run around causing chaos with awesome effects and humorous outcomes. So I was super excited and suprised when I saw postal 3 on steam. Boy was I majorly disappointed. I saw it had the potentional for that same off society norm humor but the game itself is terrible. NO OPEN WORLD. The first few ""areas"" I tried were timed, small and so poorly executed it was frustrating. Not to mention where the crosshairs are and where you can actually hit anything was beyond frustrating. I tried for at least an hour or so to have any fun but finally gave up and uninstalled. So sad too compared to the genius of the first 2 games.			"

Game Is base off an old source engine build so all the levels caches need to rebuild apon loading, The AI is terrible and annoying, Weapon selection is terrible sometimes during heavy combat, why put in a shotgun then have no ammo for it for the entire ♥♥♥♥ing game? , The game crashed at least four times when loading a few levels.. It's not worth it.. another classic game gone to nothing but♥♥♥♥♥♥ >=C			"

												I sure enjoyed Postal 2... Now there's a Postal 3 on the Source Engine! The trailers and gameplay look cool, nothing too serious just messing around. Is this game worth buying? No. Not at all. Back when this was first released the publishers of this game released it early by mistake (a month!) later on the game was re-released a few months later. It was a complete disaster. The steam version is in Russian, and there is no legit or 'legal' way should I say to get this game into English. The game is very buggy, very poor performance and frame rate issues, clunky controls, the game is just bad. Don't buy it. Ever.			"

												I don't think this would be a recommendation, it's more like an avoidation.If you want a good Postal game, get the old ones. Since this one right here was a big disappointment. In short I recommend that you shouldn't get this.			"

												ok so this game is based on current world issues and stuff and just makes fun of stereotypes and can be offensive and has been really contraversial for ever, like since 1997, and if you arnt a baby its incredibly fun. this is not as good as the first 2 seeing as it was made by a different studieo but its still a good time. not great but ok.its fun if your super bored but Postal 2 is way better.this is like a spin off, even rws says so.{RWS Explanation}vPostal III didn’t turn out how RWS had hoped.The original plan was for RWS to do game design and style art, with Akella responsible for production (coding, game art, audio, playtesting, etc.). The project started out great with both groups working close together, then the first blow came with the Russian economy taking a hit and Akella lost their A development team and the project got moved to Team B. Looking back now we should have canceled the project then as there was no way the new less qualified team was going to be able to deliver a “A” quality game. The next big blow was when Akella started chopping away at our design (to accommodate the limited skills of the 2nd string team), this only got worse over time. From eliminating gameplay to single player only to PC only and scratching consoles. The hole kept getting deeper and the♥♥♥♥♥♥shovel was in full force. We didn't even get to see or play the game in the last 12 months of development, then the worst thing happened. Akella was desperate for money trying to prevent going out of business. They made the fatal decision to ‘wrap it up’ at alpha and call it done, releasing it to the Russian market, then on Steam for the international market.Akella retains control of all the source code and assets for Postal III which they will not share with us or the modding community, so we are unable to fix Postal III ourselves, leaving a flawed and unfinished game. RWS also do not profit from Postal III sales and we stopped selling it ourselves the moment it was clear we would be unable to support the product.Postal III is not without some redeeming features for fans of POSTAL: graphically it looks nice, the cutscene art and music was decent and it has some interesting unique weapons such as the Badger Saw. The branching storyline and Good versus Bad system allows you to replay the game and encounter new levels, alternative scenes and it even allows you to complete the objectives differently. The game at least knows it’s a train wreck and will often make fun of itself during the objective screens.			"

												This game is awfully developed, disappointing to play, 'a bad joke'-to pay for and i can advise it to nobody. It's really like a ""Beta-Version"" and is not worth 01,00$! Everything is glitching and you'll find a bug every minute. I love(d) ""Postal II"" so much, it was one of the best games I've ever played.Postal III is not just nearly unplayable. It has nothing to do with Postal II - game mechanics. No more 'free-world' action-adventure ""I have to buy milk and will not pay for it"" - freedom.Do not buy it. It's on sale? Do not buy it! Someone gifted it to you. Do not play it!			"

												This is the buggiest piece of crap I have ever played. Steam REFUSES to give me a refund, even though I bought this game back in April of 2012 for $40. The only reason I have more than 2 hours playtime is because it was stuck in the loader downloading the game on a 384kb line back in 2012 (I live in South Africa) and steam decided that me downloading the game was actually me playing it. I hardly played this game, it completly bugged out on the segway mission, with AI driving into walls and getting stuck. Worst purchase I have ever made, I urge anyone else considering to buy this NOT TO. Don't pay a single cent for this garbage.			"

												As a diehard fan of the real Postal games, it's very difficult for me to think of any redeeming qualities of Postal III.Many know this already, but for those who don't, Postal III is not the creation of Running With Scissors. It was licensed to Akella in hopes of developing a next generation Postal game, but thanks to the Russian recession Akella went bankrupt and all developmental work went to a fledgling ""b-team."" The results were catastrophic, as what was once intended to be an open ended and graphically impressive Postal became a bug-ridden mess. Although its price can never be justified even at 50% off, I will say that for those who already own it, two things about this game are decent. First is the free-roam feature that is unlocked after completing those horrid story missions. If you really can't stand playing through it, which few can, there are ways to bypass the missions that a simple Google search will yield. The free-roam itself is mediocre, as there are few things to do but walk around and slaughter a few civilians until the game crashes, but it's much more rewarding than the series of tutorials that constitute the main game.The second feature worth mentioning was a joke that occurred... I'd say about halfway through the game, where the Alternative Postal Dude is approaching a building being held up by rather incompetent shooters. In the midst of the inaccurate bullet fest, a peacekeeper attempts to approach the building only to have his head blown off. The Postal Dude then exclaims, ""holy s***, did they level up?"" It made me laugh, anyways.That's really all that's worth experiencing in Postal III. You're much better off paying a fraction of Postal III's price to own the real Postal games.			"

												I'm not going to claim that ""Postal 2"" was a masterpiece of the art form.  It wasn't.  It was trashy, poorly coded, and its humour was more groan worthy than anything.  But goddamit, it WAS fun in some sick, twisted way - particularly when aided by the ""A Week in Paradise"" mod that expanded its variety and fixed a lot of its bugs, etc.  It was a cathartic experience that let you indulge in a bit of depravity to let the stress flow by.  ""Postal III"" on the other hand, is a torture simulator at the players expense - not the NPCs.  This game is abysmally bad.  The hit detection is the worst I've ever experienced in a game, and even when you do hit there's no sense of tactile feedback.  There is not a single weapon in this game, except perhaps the Badger, that is in any way satisfying to use.  About the only praise I can give this game in ANY sense is that while the humour is still pretty rank, there are a few more genuinely good, surreal jokes that might hit low brow sensibilities.  I actually did laugh once or twice when the joke wasn't ""Misogyny/gross stuff"" etc.  This is the most broken♥♥♥♥♥game I've ever seen released that took so long to make, this was in development as far back as 2004 and yet it feels like a proof of concept alpha - a proof of concept that in any true quality assurance workers mind, would not see as proving any viable concept at all.  Its linear, broken, and practically unplayable.  Say what you will about Postal 2 and its flaws - but at least everyone can agree that this one is legitimately pure♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												There is simply NOTHING good about this game. Think of everything that was fun about Postal 2 and none of that is in Postal 3. This is a really god awful 3rd person shooter with terrible gun combat mechanics, a broken melee system with horrible hit detection, and remember the open world non linear structure of Postal 2? Well now it's 100% linear. It wasn't until months after its release that they put in an open world mode which is just a save file with the whole city and no missions. That was the only midly decent thing in the whole game. Another thing that sucks is that they don't even have the Postal Dude's voice actor from the last game.Do you want to know what the worst part of this game is? A good 80-85% of the game are escort/protection missions. Apparantly in Russia game devs think that gamers LOVE escort missions with the worst AI so they should make that the focus of the game. Because when you think Postal, you totally think of escort missions. Maybe that's what was missing from Postal 1&2. The game's long series of escort missions involve never ending spaws of enemies who all have one goal which is to kill your target and shoot at you. The guy you protect has no logic, they just stand there getting shot until they die. In missions where you need to follow someone to a goal, they often just stop or get stuck on something while the endless enemies kill them. When it comes to protecting someone in a single location, it's more of the same, they stand in once place and get shot to death.The story is passable, but you can watch all the cut scenes on YouTube and save yourself $20. One thing that was promised was branching story paths with real drastic changes to the plot, like what jobs you have, such as being a cop or a terrorist, or even running for president. The reality is that the game has a karma meter and the more innocents that die in your crossfire, the more the meter turns evil which puts you on the evil path. One of the first ""evil"" missions has you on a cult where you use their version of the Gravity Gun from Half-Life to suck up apples and shoot them in barrels, 100 apples. They actually thought this would be fun. In the end, it's the same old crap, and I never did find a way to gain moral points. You just lose morality from accidently killing people with the terrible controls.That's the whole game. There's a ton of escort missions, really bad shoot 'em up levels that have terrible level design (often getting you lost,) tons and tons of glitches, a variety of weapons, but none of them are that useful, the worst AI possible, weak voice acting, a lame story, and the creators of Postal had nothing to do with the making of this game, they infact disowned this game and pulled it from their web store. I remember a lot of critics hating Postal 2 and giving it crazy low scores without even playing it, but this game actually deserves to be bashed. There's just nothing fun about it. Not even mods could ever fix this mess of a game.			"

												this is a really bad sequel to postal 2. you should think that with the source engine it would be a great experience, but no. you cant feel that your are playing with the same engine as the half-life 2 series. i would consider my self a fan of postal 2 and the movie, so the only thing making this game worth bying is the humor, thats just as insane as the rest of the postal branch,but not surprised that this game got such a lawsy metascore.

												This game is the biggest turd... it is so bug ridden that it is embarrasing. All the stupid things should add up to something fun in a dumb way, but because everything functions so poorly it ends up being frustrating. Also I have no idea who at RWS said that this game, essentially Postal 2 with updated graphics, should be third person. Whoever suggested it should be forced to play this game for hours on end, and believe me when I say that is quite the sadistic torture.			"

												In a word NO!  Don't go for it.  I loved Postal 2 with its open ended world (with progressive plot if you knew where to look) and wicked sense of humour.  I thought I was getting a good deal when I got a $10 steam key from the publisher for Postal 3, but it couldn't even live up to that.  Each mission takes place on a small map.  The movement is awkward.  It isn't even worth saying more.			"

												Wow, this is one big-blast waste of money. Seriously. I played Postal 2, and I was a huge fan of it. But this one? Crappy made, reused sounds from it's predecessor, laggy controling and gameplay, broken game mechanics. I don't even comprehend how the developers could be anything near happy with that game, after what they've accomplished in the past. Keep your money away from♥♥♥♥♥♥of game design, guys.			"

												From my original review, Postal III was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful sequel to Postal 2.However, let's take it back a few notches.Postal III is a third person shooter, unlike Postal 2, which was a first person shooter. The game, gameplay wise, is similar to Postal 2. You shoot♥♥♥♥♥♥and perform tasks.However, Postal III introduces alignment. You can be good, or bad, and depending on your actions, you get different endings. For example, helping cops bust a hippie pot ring aligns you Good. Killing everyone during the bust aligns you Bad. That is a pretty cool feature that makes this game one of the more unique Postal games.The game makes outside references to the likes of people such as the infamous director Uwe Boll, Gary Coleman from Postal 2, and other such things. It's got the Postal feel, and everything that is there is great, but it doesn't work all the time.That's really my only main complaint with the game. Due to layoffs and rushes, the game is extremely buggy, and crashes often. The game runs on Valve's Source Engine.Postal III on the inside has all the mechanics and gameplay aspects to make a good Postal game.However, on the outside, it's a buggy mess that crashes often, has gameplay breaking bugs such as cutscenes not playing, parts of the map unrendering, and other such things. It's price isn't really warranted, considering it is a buggy crashing mess. If you get it gifted, or buy it out of curiosity, you might be dissapointed, but the game itself is still enjoyable if you can look passed it's flaws.			"

												Akella's POSTAL Spin off (AKA Postal III) is a game I would no longer recommend to anyone. It's full of bugs and glitches, most of the weapons are rubbish, the AI is horrendous, the frame rate will randomly shoot down at times, no free roam for you until you finish the story and despite the fact that this game was released in 2012 in the UK and Europe, it's using the same version of the Source engine that was used in Half-Life 2: Episode 2. Akella and TrashMasters have completely abandoned the game, so why should you buy this unfinished mess? Most of the staff at Running With Scissors don't even like this game. If you want to play a good Postal game, buy Postal 2.			"

												I enjoyed the first postal and postal 2 for the B grade gore and humour. Don't come into this expecting fluid gun control and movement. There are MANY bugs. I have not encountered any that are breakable to the story but more a laughing matter. But they do not overall detract from the humorous gameplay and storyline behind the the sadley aged source engine used. However the good/bad moral alignment can be a little difficult as some missions require you to be bad to complete them. Again, not a major issue for somebody willing to take the time to look past these issues and play it in the same thought as the prequels. Even the controls feel the same. A fun romp through a wild story filled with cursing and blood spurts so over the top you would think they were made to look that way. Hell, you can craft a gun that shoots a cat off it by its butt hole!!! Running with scissors, you have done a good job in all the harsh remarks this game brought with it. Although an ingame map would have been handy...... Still much of the game to play, but first impressions are good. Graphics: 6-7. Gameplay: 7. Overall: 7			"

While first person would've been more appreciated from my side, the third person is okay despite difficulties in shooting. It's really not as bad as people make it out to be - but you should buy it at a discounted price.			"

												* Well to sum it up, the problem of this game is that is just plain boring, it fails to recapture the ridicolous morbid fun of its predecessor. * The graphics are good, it runs on Source Engine and looks alright to me, although there some mighty performance glitches with frame rate dropping.* The open world is there partially, but you cannot complete missions as you like but have to stick to the main story line. * You revisit the outdoor locations several times during the game, which gets repetitive and the task you get are one stereotype.* You collect something, then all of sudden there is a riot by some of the minorities or some other group of extremists, which you have to eliminate.* You cannot get inside any building, you can take a look indoors only during missions, which is a nice change of pace, then you go back outside to one of the three main locations: downtown of city, mexican border or some kind of farm.* I loved Postal 2 for not being the perfect game, but for trying not to be convetional and yet entertaining, but this one just couldn't hold up its potential.

												Unfortunately for RWS, this game was really badly developed and completely unoptimized. It's not their fault as they handed the development off to a russian company that started having financial troubles and had to lay off their prime team because they couldn't afford to pay them anymore. Instead, they fell back to the backup team which couldn't handle most of the intended design, and the game had to be extensively redesigned to accomodate their lack of experience and skill. I believe the company has completely shut down now, and won't give RWS the source code so they could properly clean it up and perfect it. Instead, RWS has chosen to abandon this horrible game, and resume working on Postal 2. Buy that instead, don't waste your money on this game! (they're working on a new DLC for Postal 2 right now!)

												Don't bother with this game.  It's so riddled with bugs it's not worth playing.  When the Russian developer took over the duties from Running With Scissors they had no clue what a Postal game is supposed to be.  Postal's about sick humor but giving you a mission that involves picking up used kleenex from a porno peep show is not just sick, it's just gross.  The controls are confusing, the graphics stuck in 2005 and the story disgusting.  In short if the game is free and you're a 12 year old that likes to eat your own boogers this game is great... "

												After I bought Postal 2, i saw that there was a third one and it had modern-day graphics and i thought that was pretty cool and then I saw all the negative reviews except for the literally only postive review and i thought to myself, hmmm I wonder how bad this game is? Seeing as how the second one was badass and amazingly better than some of the AAA games we get served today, so i bought it, played it and beat it, and now i now why this game is slandered, even RWS has given up on this trainwreck but before i trash this game more i have to say there are parts of this game that are good but far from being awesome.Like my review of Postal 2, this review will broken down in the same areasGameplay, Graphics, Sound and most importantly StoryWarning: this is my opinon and if anything offends you, i deeply apolgizeGameplay 5/10: the overall gmeplay isn't all to bad, the controls aren't bad but they are a big difference from its predecessor, the main control feature i like about this game is you don't have to use the mouse scroll for changing your guns, you can now use X and C for that which for me (being a console gamer for 16 years) is a big up for me since i'm still new to the PC controls. The game praises it's so called ""advanced AI"" but in reality the so-called ""advanced AI"" isn't so advanced unless advanced AI means running in your line of fire and killing all the ""advanced AI"" in like two secondsGraphics 6/10: the graphics of this game are not that bad but also not that good for a game that was realeased in 2011. there are times where the graphics acutally look complete and then other times your face palming with more regert than Patrick Stewert.Sound 8/10: this is the only department that this game did good in. The BGM of this game is amazing, the only time the BGM is bad, is that it is stuck in a never-ending loop, so in the longer levels in the game it starts to become a ear ache. The sound F/X of this game is why the sound gets an 8 out of 10 instead of being a perfect score, the gun noises in this aren't as realistic as they were Postal 2, but they aren't horrible either, at least they are actually sounds instead of one guy making ""pew-pew"" noises.Story 6/10: the only reason this game's story did better than Postal 2 is because it's more of a linear based game, so there is more room for story, but the main reason ot only did a point better was becasue it's story was all over the f***ing place, when i finally beat the game, i had no f***ing idea what the f*** happend, the story has more holes in it than swiss cheese or a Micheal Bay movie (uggh don't get me started on him)Overall 4.5/10: Overall this game needs A LOT more work and if it was developed on for a little bit longer (i'd say like two more years) it may have been a better game but I personally think that it should have been the exact same game as the second but with a new story and graphics like Halo 3. (ahhh if only) But before i go, the nic people over at Anthology Production, are making a mod for Postal 2, and it's basically taking Postal 3 and putting it into the engine of the second game and more! So i cannot wait for it to come out. so as you can see I do NOT reccomend this game but if you really want to play this s***ty game than wait for that mod.			"

												The game is buggy, broken & sometimes unplayable.  I get to around chapter 3 & can't progress any further because of constant crashes or glitches.  The game hasn't seen any fixes either.  I honestly can't recommend this game unless one day the devs decide it's worth fixing.  Even then the humor is tasteless & might have been funny or offensive in the early/late 90's.  Now, it's just childish & sad really.If they ironed out the bugs it would be a decent 3rd person toilet humor shooter but with all the bugs, glitches, crashes & other problems the game has it's just a chore to try and play through it.I got this game when it came out, too.

												I can see that you're thinking of buying this. You're thinking ""Aha! Postal 2 was great, I want to try this too!"" NAY I TELL YOU!Sure, there are a few hours of fun in here, but it's absolutely nowhere near as good as Postal 2 was. On top of that it's buggy and it feels like it was released while it was still in Beta development.I uninstalled it in frustration and disappointment.			"

												It's what you would expect from a Postal game as far as the humor and violence goes.  Can't say I like the 3rd person perspective; it would be fine if it wasn't so clunky.  The game is buggy and running on the source engine it should be a lot smoother.  The game is no longer open world, but it tries to give some good/bad choices to make but they don't seem to make a huge difference.  The game makes fun of how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is, with stuff popping up on the screen like ""Postal Babes are on your side, so good luck not killing them in this AI cluster♥♥♥♥! HAHAHAHAH.""  Wait for a $10 sale or at least until some mods come out and bugs are fixed.			"

												Don't listen to what any reviewers or idiotic youtube comments say. This game is AWESOME. It's not as bad as people say it is, and doesn't deserve the ratings it's getting. The only reason it gets bad ratings is because it's offensive. But the same thing went for Postal 2, and the offensive part was what made it fun. Sure some people hate it because of that, but they obviously don't know it's all in good fun, and they can't take a joke. Postal 3 is a vast improvement over the last game. The graphics are the best, the new weapons are fun, missions are fun and interesting and actually require some thought, and don't even get me started on the soundtrack. If you want crazy, destructive fun, you've come to the wrong place. If you want insane, Earth-shattering, slaughter-festivities and violent good times, then welcome.			"

												Postal III is a good game. Is it the best game? No. But it is a good game.Here are the things thats in the game so you'll know. I'm not gonna say to buy it or not but you have the choice whether you choose to or not. So here the following things this game has compare to Postal 2.Different voice actor for Dude.The map is rather a bit smaller in oppose to Postal 2 big maps, where its practically open world while it isnt in Postal III where you can actually explore places in Postal 2 and go through pretty much any houses you see. Postal III doesnt have that and certain areas are only opened.Third person view, replace first person view.No difficulty in this game, which is pretty crucial to those that enjoys a challenge, in oppose to Postal 2's, especially the highest difficulty where pretty much everywhere is a warzone.Alternate endings: Good, neutral, bad (only way to get neutral is to literally not do anything good or bad, just mind your business).The story is fairly good, and depending on your paths the good ending has some epic battles. But overall, the game is rather average.Did I also forget to mention theres no workshop as well? Postal 2 has that.I recommend those that enjoys a good run on the story like me. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THOSE THAT WANTS TO ENJOY THE GAME IN GENERAL! Get Postal 2 if you are into that.			"

												Postal III is a janky, barely functional mess that has none of the charm, character, or fun of Postal 2. Running With Scissors had little to do with this game and it shows. The game runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥(if you can get it running at all), and the first person, open world nature of the second game is replaced with boring, medicore, third-person cover based shooting. Oh yeah, don't forget everyone's favorite: A shallow binary moral choice system! Going around on rampages is still somewhat fun, but there is no heart or soul in this game. If you are an abosule, diehard Postal fan, pick it up on sale as cheap as you can if you're into some casual masochism. Otherwise avoid like the plague.Also, ♥♥♥♥ the Postal Dude's new voice.			"

												One of the most unoptimized PC games ever made. It crashes, it freezes, and it stutters, constantly. Even with user-created .cgf files, Postal III is guaranteed to be a frustrating technical challenge for even the most stacked high-end computer.The developers went belly up shortly after the game was released, and it's not hard to understand why after playing just a few minutes of this atrocious excuse for code. Even worse, the publisher has disavowed Postal III completely, and they refuse to fix it or improve it in any way, shape, or form.Not only is Postal III a buggy piece of crap, it fares no better gameplay-wise. Despite being an open-world game, the story forces you down a particular path, and you aren't allowed to free roam until you've completed all the missions. The weapons suck, the graphics suck, the environments suck, the sound effects suck. Absolutely everything about Postal III sucks. You're better off going with Postal 2 -- it's cheaper and it actually runs properly.Screw the developers and the publisher of this digital abortion. They should have known better.			"

												If the president played this, there would be another Cold War.Seriously though this game is dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ for one the weapons are terrible and inaccurate. The missions are also terrible, they play more like Apocalypse Weekend where you have to do a repetitive activity a few times until you can progress instead of like Postal 2 where you go somewhere and do an errand like ""get milk"" you can choose a few ways to do it (i.e buy the milk or go guns blazing) and maybe something goes wrong (like robbers showing up at the bank). The morality system is dumb and discourages playing how you want like in postal 2, instead you pick one way and have to stick to it the whole the game. The game is also filled with outdated references and internet memes which will do nothing but make you cringe, the memes are also on the loading screens which are another issue, countless loading screens that take forever. Postal 2 had loading but that is an unreal 2 game from 2003, those loading screens are also way faster and don't feel the need to slap jokes on the screen.Even the developers of the first two games discourage buying this, don't do it, buy Postal 2.

												Holy ♥♥♥♥ this is bad.I mean I heard it was bad. And the last two games were bad games in their own ways as well. [NOTE: I am not talking about offensive content I am really talking about the quality of the games]. Postal 1 was an absolute mess, and a violent, attention whoring relic of early PC gaming, and Postal 2 was a short, glitchy, grotesque, and insanly racist piece of FPS history...But this is more glitchy than it's predecessor, it lacks the ""charm"" the previous game had, and it's not a sandbox! It's a poorly made 3rd person coverbased shooter that goes from bad cutscenes to bad gameplay back to bad cutscenes. THERE IS A FORCED TUTORIAL MISSION AT THE BEGINING CALLED ""CROSS THE BRIDGE"" OR SOME♥♥♥♥♥♥AND YOU MOSTLY CROSS THE BRIDGE IN ♥♥♥♥ING CUTSCENES!!!Bottom line the Postal series is a game set in a shared universe that is full of crude, immature shock comedy... and that isn't a bad thing. Frankly, I'm nostalgiaic over the first one. I played it a lot as a kid and at the time I took the whole thing as a big joke meant to offend people (which a great portion of it reall is just that), and my cousin played it, I shared it with all my friends back when I had the physical copy... It's the worlds wierdest ""kids"" game lol. BUT Postal 3 has horrible UI, hit detection, level design, has the worst graphics of a Source powered game that I've ever scene...

Good graphics and funny.Pros:Runs goodSource engineGraphicsGoreCharactersCons:Runs bad in massive gunfightsFeels kinda cheap since a lot of the sounds are default source sounds.Couldnt find a good balance of the volume, its either you can hear people when they speak but go deaf in gunfights or people are super quiet and guns are decent.Some missions stop working and have to be replayed "

												I have played postal 1 and postal 2 with the 1337 patch a long long time ago (to make it work properly on really old systems) and i have postal 2 on steam now, so essentially i have paid to that game twice now, actually 3 times as i bought it off rws website quite a few years ago as a digital download (non steam related). To be honest i dont mind as its a great game to play and still makes me laugh (good on ya running with scissors). However, i am a PC owner and a FPS player and i am a very dissapointed that this latest incarnation has turned into a TPS and appears to be a port from a console game. Not a happy bunny RWS, i should have taken on board what some of the others had said.			"

												Like everyone says in the comments on this game, Postal 2 is ALOT better than 3. Postal 3 feels unfinished and it has no moralation to it and all these haters on the Postal series... its bad but not terrible. My dad was a postal fan and he bought the fudge pack and postal 1 and 2 seperately, I looked through his pc games and he has very good taste in video games I gotta admit. Postal 3 may have not been nowhere near the game of the year but if you love very very VERY dark and occasionally funny humor and Jokes that wont nessacerily make you laugh on the outside then the Postal Series/Postal 3 is worth running with scissor's regular price of 20 dollars, Its not a bad game if you find out a way to get past the bugs and empty holes the developers didnt care enough to fill. Postal 3 is entertaining and worth the time playing it, it's a very stupid game and I never said it was a good game I just think its not as stupid as south park even though South Park is quadruple x10 more popular then Postal. I enjoyed it and all these people can say my mind is just out there for liking such a trainwreck of a video game but I enjoyed it and thats what matters the most			"

												I, like most, was a big fan of Postal 2 and with great excitment fired up Postal 3 only to be let down. It is much more linear with two distinct paths that clearly are meant to be played in order; I clearly choose the ""wrong"" way first leading to a confusing ending that was cleared up after playing through differently the second time. Poor combat, a phoney open world, a horrendous amount of bugs and a sound track that gets annoying in a hurry leads me back to playing Postal 2 and wishing I never made this purchase.			"

												I loved Postal 2. I read plenty of reviews of Postal III and saw enough coverage of the development hell involved in producing it. For some reason I figured that I might somehow be able to get something out of this game. But there are so many critical and fundamental issues with Postal III that I cannot even find solace in the arcs of urine and vomit. More video intro (which is just in-game footage with a filter) than gameplay in the first 30 minutes or so. Fundamental sound issues. AWFUL dialogue, and not in the cheeky Postal 2 way - lots of it is just directly copied from 2. Giant walls of text explaining the mundane tasks you need to accomplish. Melee weapons are largely useless as characters seems to slide past each other like they're greased. The animations and models seem like they simply put higher res textures on the models from Postal 2. Social commentary that would make a Che Guevara t-shirt seem well considered. In an era where open world modes are needlessly crammed into every game going, Postal III somehow manages to remove the open world of the second game. Not even if it's on sale.			"

												Please, dont buy this pile of rubbish.Im currently in the process of getting a refund, despite it being purchased for £5 in the sale!  I have never deemed a game so bad to request a refund until i came across this piece of garbage.  This game crashed ever time i tried to play it.  I have never come across something so buggy, batman wasnt even that bad!  Then of course their is the control system and the game mechanics, which are utterly broken.  Even if this thing was free, I would advise you not to waste your bandwidth downloading it, or time playing it!  I can see why running with scissors ran away from this mess.  The very fact it still bears their name is an insult to all postal games that have come before it.  I can only hope RWS make a true successor to postal 2 which is not as buggy, and doesnt suck as much as this.			"

												I had a bit of fun with Postal 2 back in the day so when Portal 3 promised me a honey badger as a weapon and a better camera for the game I threw my money at this once it was on sale. As I purchased and installed this game I found the free roaming atmosphere that left the world open in the previous game where choice was key to story progression had been replaced with a small linear map that pushed obnoxious cutscenes in our face with a voiceover that screams ""I'm trying to sound like Duke Nukem."" The worst part is that this game actually gave me herpes. As I played this game I found that my fingers started breaking out in blemishes which then spread to my arms. Before anything could spread further the honey badger jumped out of the screen and ripped out my jugular. With my last breath I write this review. Please tell my family I'm sorry I bought this game.			"

												Postal 3 starts with Uwe Boll giving you the finger, in a loading screen.This follows through the missions where it's apparent that the game it's just trying to mess with the player but not in the good old fashioned Postal way.Postal 3 strives so far from both of it's predecesors that eventually it seems clear that Trashmasters (ironically) don't know even the involment that a player has when it comes to it's game, it expects you to sit throughout boring, unstilized missions, without any purpose or reason behind them.Postal 3 it's the pinnacle of bad game design, and insultity for the pleyer and the series, i'ts the lame, pathetic excuse that comes from a group of people that believe comedy begins with a fart and ends with and insult, with people that make pathetic. lame jokes, thinking that what causes controversy and makes someone feel offended somehow it's an attractive point in entertainment.

I still recommend this game to anyone who is as sick in the head (or sane) as I am!Sure some of the AI's are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but try to think of a game that hasent got a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or ****** up AI in it.

												It's not ENTIRELY terrible. If you can snag it at below $10 you'll find it's just as delightfully offensive as Postal 2. That being said, it has  LOT of shortcomings compared to Postal 2 (like the lack of an open world and SUPER terribad optimization issues), but after my time with it, I'd say ""eh, it's still fun to taze monkeys, cats, dogs, and people and then pee on them before riding off on a segway to protect mayor Ron Jeremy because he's running for president (I think, I don't really remember, things were so crazy).Unfortunately you WILL have to reload the game a lot because of bugged missions, and you WILL hate the dumbass morality meter (which sometimes doesn't seem to work), but overall, it's offensively innoffensive with a fun arsenal of weapons and the same complete disdain for the player and the world that characterizes Postal.I only recommend it on a DEEP price cut, however.

												Overall: Meh.Let me just start out this review by stating that I am an immense Postal fan. I've played all three games, so why not write a review on the one Postal fans are unsure the most about? Well here it goes. (Also, please note this is my first serious review. Go easy on me, please.)	For those Postal fans out there, you're aware that the first game was a dark, gruesome and disturbing game about an insane man who goes on a killing spree around Paradise, a city in Arizona. You're also aware that it's sequel, Postal 2, went the exact opposite direction and made it a dark  humor	 game with some funny parts and some dark parts. So where did the third game, Postal 3, go for? Well, it followed Postal 2's sense of humor which is in my opinion a pro of this game. While some may not be able to enjoy the gameplay, the humor from the 2nd game is still here. Anyway, many people complain this game is too buggy to be played. While playing through the game, I hardly saw any bugs. Yes, there were a few with NPC's and the Dude himself but it didn't make the game unplayable for me.Now, let's look at some cons:First thing you'll notice; the loading screens take a good eternity. All of them. You'd be able to grab a beer in the time it takes to get the game loaded. So, might as well.This game takes away all freedom in the story mode. Sure, after you complete the game you unlock free-roam, but until then, you pretty much go wherever the game takes you. Many of the NPCs take a lot of damage before they're down, no matter the weapon you're using. Melee weapons are quite buggy and very unsatisfying to hit/kill with. The physics with NPCs seem doll-like, and unappealing.The first Postal game took on an overhead view while the 2nd took on a first person view. This one takes on a third person view. Not much to say here. Like third person games? Keep reading.The game isn't too long or too short, and includes three different endings, depending on how you play throughout the game. Good, Bad, and Neutral. Again, not a whole lot to say.Now let's talk about that price tag. Twenty bucks. Yeaahhh that's not gonna fly. The game is okay in my opinion, but definitely not worth twenty dollars. Wait until its on sale half-off or less.Overall, I gotta give this game a 6/10. Its not bad, but not as good as either of the other Postal games. If you're new to the series, play Postal 2 or Postal 1 first.			"

												I had a bit of fun with Postal 2 back in the day so when Portal 3 promised me a honey badger as a weapon and a better camera for the game I threw my money at this once it was on sale. As I purchased and installed this game I found the free roaming atmosphere that left the world open in the previous game where choice was key to story progression had been replaced with a small linear map that pushed obnoxious cutscenes in our face with a voiceover that screams ""I'm trying to sound like Duke Nukem."" The worst part is that this game actually gave me herpes. As I played this game I found that my fingers started breaking out in blemishes which then spread to my arms. Before anything could spread further the honey badger jumped out of the screen and ripped out my jugular. With my last breath I write this review. Please tell my family I'm sorry I bought this game.			"

												Well if you've played Postal 1 & 2, then you already know the cool♥♥♥♥♥♥to expect. The graphics are awesome, the Dude is funnier in this one and RIP to Champ. Unfortunately, this game crashes a lot! I can only play maybe about 10 minutes before it crashes. I've tried it on 3 different very full spec'd computers, same issue. Sucks because I actually enjoy this game. You should wait to buy this game until the crashing is fixed, if not it'll just sit in your Library.			"

												The game is broken, if you email ""arkhipov@akella.com"" then we're likely to get the achievements fixed.First impressions so far.I downloaded the game. (wish I hadn't).Clicked Play. I saw a picture of Uve Boll sticking his finger up at me, The game then crashed. Yep, that's basically my expectations for the rest of the game. I then started the tutuorial and was told to ingite some zombies. INGITE. (That's not my spelling mistake, that's exactly how it was spelt and what the game told me to do.They've also slaughtered the Source engine, it's no wonder we don't have Half-Life 3. Valve had to make another engine after this game was released.Also, for those of you that like your Source console commands and your Postal experience in 1st person mode. You get to eat♥♥♥♥♥♥because typing firstperson into the console tells you that the game is already in first person. (even though the whole game takes place in 3rd person). Entering thirdperson makes the camera aim straight at the floor. So instead of using the default 3rd person mode that Source uses they've decided to use the first person mode and pull the camera back, for some reason. I was also told not to press a button, so I'm not whilst I currently wait for the game to progress. After I spent waiting the game started to insult me for doing exactly what it told me to do. The people that made this game should kill themselves. I'm not joking. They've made a mess of the Source engine and a mess of the Postal series.			"

												+ There's the postal dude+ There is the postal humor (Cats, terrorists , stereotypes...)+ Still violent+ There's Uwe Boll, Ron Jeremy, etc.- Third person - Linear (but there's a free roam when you end the game)- Uses a lot of disc space- Maybe it comes from my computer , but everytime there's a lot of action... THIS LAGS AS HELL AND I WANT TO GO POSTAL FOR REAL AND TO SHOOT MY COMPUTER WITH A SHOTGUN TO PEE ON IT - AWFUL loading time (You'll waste most of your time in the loading screens)- It kinda ruins the postal franchise and even the original postal developpers (RWS) won't sell it on their site- Even the postal dude says ""GTA physics are better"" (That's actually funny)I recommend it when it's on sale and only to the big postal fans			"

												If you are even remotely thinking of buying this game, go buy Postal 2 first. Postal 3 is developed by Trashmasters (some would say they ""trashed"" the game) and published by Akella (as opposed to Running with Scissors who both published an developed the previous game). Trashmasters left out the key concepts that made Postal 2 a good game. Very much a linear game no open world. The only benefit of playing this game is that when you eventually play Postal 2 it looks like a frikin' masterpiece compared to this.			"

												You will like this game, if you're a masochist!Postal 3, now officialy renamed Russian Postal, is game publised by the bancrupt Akella Studios and produced by (defunct at the game's release) studio Trashmasters. You play as Not the Postal  dude from Postal 2 by surviving an onslaught of whacky shenaningans in the city of Catharsis.The game is a linear third person shooter that pits you against ecologists, Asians and bees. Your arsenal ranges from graffiti cans to rabid badgers and shotguns. There are also moral choices to consider that eventually determine which ending you get at the completion of the campaign.Sorry, the previous paragraph praising Russian Postal is made of lies and I am a terrible person, but hey, have an imaginary biscuit as a reward for reading this far! Now on to the actual review:Russian Postal is so terrible it's not even funny. The game has never been properly tested (if tested at all) upon its release which is noticable right from the moment you boot it up. If it doesn't crash, good for you, it will do so later, a bunch of times.   The main campaign is broken into missions which open as you progress through the story. They offer a variety of things from stealing sagways from gay bikers to protecting Uwe Boll from DnD nerds and trekkies, crammed with awkward stereotypes and 'hillarious' jokes. The little writing this game had really shines here when you scratch your head on reffereces that stopped being funny 10 years ago.Gameplay wise the game is passable, but not anything stellar. Everything happends in third person and you use your mouse and keyboard to navigate, fire weapons, scroll your inventory and huff catnip. The problem is that most of the creative weapons like the badger saw, machete and the fart gun are ALL useless because physical damage is paltry and the hitboxes are broken to hell, which makes you swining at air instead of your assailants. It doesn't really help going mellee because every enemy in this game carries a machine gun and is also an ace shooter. The firearm encounters chew your ammunition in mere seconds and leave you with half-dozen unusable weapons  Therefore the game forces you to farm bullets from NPCs, which also mostly use mellee weapons...ah and the loading times between zones are atrocious. Fun!Where little the game DOES shine are its cutscenes, which have some artistic merrit and are genuinely funny, but they are not worthy buying Russian Postal nor the pain of enduring it. My praise ends here.In the end I can't really recommend this game to anyone, with the exception of gifting it as means to an end a frienship or a relationship. Postal fans will be dissappointed because it's a downgrade from the previous two games, achievers won't be satisfied either because some trophies are not attainable due to poor coding. If you are a masochist and enjoy playing broken games with zero satisfaction, this one is right up your alley!Final verdict: two thumbs down and a fart /10			"

												worst game ever. not like the last 2 games. controls are horrible. a mouse is for surfing the web. a keyboard is for typing. special moves are for arcades. I didn't pay $50 for a control pad just for gathering dust. I don't care what the graphics look like if the controls are so lame. too many buttons and options. programmers are probably Elder scroll trolls who need to go outside. I would ask for my money back if I could. don't buy this ripoff of a game.			"

												After the whole ♥♥♥♥♥how, postal dude and his loveable dog champ finds themselves in the small town of Catharsis.This game is really a step down from previous postal titles, its just not very good. But me being a postal fan I gave it a chance and I think despite the road they went down with Postal 3, its not to bad. The good/bad system is really interesting, and the different missions do keep it playable. There is a some-what freemode to it, and you can cause a lot of carnage. The effects are pretty awesome, and the fact you can shoot cops from a segway lol. but the lack of a few things really bums me out like  a suicide button which was the prime thing that made postal unique, that fact you could kill yourself at anytime made it really different from other games.Postal 3 is just a far far cry from Postal and postal 2, and thats why they messed up. Again though if you are a fan like me, you may enjoy it even though its glitchy as hell. If you do play. I recommend going to the fourm and looking at the topic on how to reduce lag and frametear. Once I did those little things in my auto.cfg for the game. It started without a problem and have had no problems with lag or tear at all.			"

Terrible aiming mechanics (why do you need to hold both mouse buttons to throw a grenade???) , bland to poorly designed missions, a moral system that seems unnecessary, and it randomly chugs RAM for no apparent reason (poor optimization for ANY video cards).

												When I first bought this game I came straight from postal 2 and i thought it was a utter waste of money and I hated it like everyone else.  I came back months later and it is still extremely buggy and crashes often but nonetheless the game itself was really fun.  Everyone expects something like the Paradise lost DLC for postal 2, but this game is not that but instead took the series in a entirely different direction.  Once I stopped expecting another postal 2 and actually treated the game as something of it's own rather than a replicate of the previous game, I enjoyed it very much.  Yeah, there are bugs and the game crashes sometimes frequently, it doesn't make it not enjoyable by any means.  I would recommend this game to anyone that isn't looking for a postal 2 clone.  If you want a postal 2 clone go for the DLC they made and not this game.  Ignore all the comments with people less than an hour who got the game uninstalled it and raged in the comments.  They were all hoping for a postal 2 clone, this is not that.8/10 (would be 10/10 if the game didn't crash)			"

												Although while I recommend getting the game just for the sake of supporting RWS after Postal 2, I think that Postal III is a really clunky game that makes little use of the Source engine (or doesn't use it to its fullest). The game is sort of laggy, has so many enemies it makes it a very challenging game, and just to run pacifist seems broken. It also seems to try and switch it up with a karma system, and a path system, and not killing/killing, but it kind of shies away from the reality that it should have just had a couple of endings, one where the Postal Dude ends up in a psych ward for killing so many people and one where he's a champion for doing what had to be done. The pop culture references, while as interesting as the ""Gary Coleman"" thing, aren't as uniquely interesting as they could have been and were sort of wasted or re-hashed. I really hope that if a Postal 4 ever comes out and it was made with Source or something, they actually utilize the engine to make use of all the options instead of ""Go to A, do B maybe, get to C, finish with the D.""

												I love Postal 2! And I loved the humor and story of Postal 3. The only thing why I dont recommend this is the lackluster gameplay and the several technical Issues.Pros:+ its Postal through and through, Sex , Violence, Racism, Animal Abuse and tons of other stuff that made this franchise famous+ the story is pretty funny+ many new and old weapons to choose from+ a new city to explore+ some celebrity characters+ great sense of humor and satire+ multiple paths to choose from, that actually change things upCons:- on a technical side the game is a complete mess. So many bugs,glitches and crashes, I will point out the worst one by one- a bug caused one of my save games to crash on being loaded.....that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off so much since I was far into the game- ALL the mlee weapons are absolutley useless.....you cant hit anything because they are so extremley poorly programmed - hit detection is a absurd- 3rd person view is pointless and even worse can trigger bugs and camera glitches.......why not stick with first person? This is a major downer!- ranged weapons feel way off when aiming, you can hit your targets but it just feels so bad to aim- gasoline is buggy and doesnt work like in postal 2, you cant pour it onto people anymore, they have to walk on the ground you´re pouring at (like I said, many special weapons are buggy)- way too many missions stick to the same formular - horde shooter where you have to take out certain people- many random crashes- you cant mount a cat on a gun -_-  seriously whos decision was it to remove this feature? Its like one of the most iconic things in Postal 2!- the explorable city is pretty small, there isnt much to actually do, I expected some kind of funny mini games, there are funny arcade cabins, but they are only cosmetic.....how disappointing- the enemy AI is none-existent.......they are so incredibly incompetent at doing anything- and like I said....many many bugs in missions and scripted eventsOh Postal.....I loved the second one, and the humor and one liners are back....but with such a horrible gameplay mechanics thats its barely playable. I played through the good campaign and it crashed too much on the bad campaign and I deinstalled in rage. If this gets waaaaay lower in price I can recommend this to a hardcore fan, other than that keep away from this.			"

												I am disliked by everyone, and I love this game.. In fact, it's one of my favorites, and I happen to be a terribly picky gamer. I probably have less 30 games in my 29 years of gaming that I'd even care to mention. What does this say? It says that this game is terribly offensive, and I love it, and so should you. My friends say my mouth should be replaced with a censor bar, and I say this game should be a mandatory experience for everyone who has come out of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Buy it, and I hope you get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off playing it.			"

 It's very hard to say how I feel about Postal 3. I'd star off by saying it's a broken piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game. It really is. It's broken all the way down to the achievements. It's extremely linear and the ""free roam"" maps are small as hell. when you initially play, your like wtf did I just play, but then, you play the good side of the story. -- I even hate to say this but the good story version of the game seemed to be more of  a overall game, even the boss fights were actually boss fights to an extent... (the ending was actually pretty epic with the tank battle) The fact that this alone allows you to draw out the gameplay factor a bit does kind of give it a replay value... Kind Of.... This is when 17 levels actually becomes 27 levels and you actually kinda feel bad for the game, because you start to see it's potential.....  This is when you really want to give it  At Least a 7/10  but ... you know it's  really a 5/10  and you can't recommend it to anyone because it's very incomplete.... ____ 5/10 ____Maybe someday a team will come along and fix it.

												Hey it is finally on steam!  This game will likely get low scores and upset fanboys because it comes accross as a parody of itself.  Anyways:  It is a Third Person action game with tons of random and sick humor in small mission based levels.  The method you use to solve the missions are very limited compared to Postal 2 because either you do things in a evil way or a good way... how you do the missions results in what type of mission you do next.  You could play the whole game killing everyone and getting evil missions or as a cop doing good things and saving people.  The whole game has alternative pathways so since I did a good guy, I missed at least 1/3 of the game of bad guy levels.The weapons are fun and killing people is fun, but overall the game feels rushed and humor is forced.  Not worth the $40.00, but I could say it would be worth $20.00 if you love sick humor and killing people with strange weapons like killer Cats.			"

												This game is way better than i expected, as i read te reviews i see lot of poeple disliking the game because of ""broken meele system"" lot of crashes and stuff but the game did not crashed at all when i played it and yeah the meele system.... but actually the meele system is not broken its just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ programed, while using theese weapons : machete,showel,axe,nighstick,nailbat the aiming cross doesnot matter you can ignore it because thoose weapons wont do damage where do corss it but where they really touch the entity like if you have guy at the aiming cross with a machete you press left mouse button but it wont hitt him but i you go near him a hit him while he is infornt of you watch the machette blade cutting him, the meele weapons work but you have to know ho to use them, because if i you try to hit somebody with meele weapon who is too away and you cant reach him but you see him in the ""Cross"" you wont him him, all the NPC will get damaged only if you really touch them with the weapon, the same broken aiming cross thingy applies for the vacuum, you might stand right infront of somebody and aim at him but you shoot to the ground, that because you have to aim the ""suck tube"" on them, the same works when you suck up things you must have the ""sucking tube"" pointed at the stuff you want to suck( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), so overall this game has dificult to contorl meele system, interestin storyline but i miss some stuff from the P.III trailer that was shown, i completed the game many times even though i have 2.6 hours, because i singplayer games offline and dont wanna be disturbed but 4 some reason offline playtime wont load but i dont really care, the new P. Dude voice actor is not the best but because Rick Hunter (original voice actor) could not do the job at that moment they hired Corey Cruise and he did a pretty great job, i also liked Corey´s little cameo in POSTAL REDUX, so the game is actually kinda good, yeah there are some bugs like the helping monkey not working sometimes but that do not really ruin the gameplay that much the story is OK, but i tottaly hate presence of Jennifer Wallcot whyyyy? I know the POSTAL BABES stuff but they could not choose someone with less annoying voice? Uncle Dave,Mayor,Boll and Osama are great but that gay bikers♥♥♥♥♥♥is too weird and dont really make sense, i like the cat silencer and cat in rocket launcher tho, also simple fix how to make POSTAL III fit in the canon ( official storyline ), when Dude gets electricuted and then GOD tells him they will send him away and Dude is falling in some deep hole ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), they could make it like hes falling and then he wakes up in his car with Champ becuase as the GOD says he was thrown in hell and so he was, because he would wake up in his car riding away from Paradise and them Postal 2 Paradise Lost Storyline could start, so this game is good but its not really the best and also the price :/ so whats better, P.II or P.III? P.II ofcourse but P.III is a good game overall.			"

I dont think this game deserves the hate . Yea, game sometimes is glitchy and crashes . But i think this is a good game , but unfortunetly Postal fans consider it as a bad awful piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game . Or probably, because it`s in third person .Personally, i love the game and it`s humor .			"

												Personally, I enjoyed the game. After fixing it by modifying the game scripts because the game is a technical failure. I never liked Postal 2. It's attempt to be South Park didn't work for me. Because I don't live in America, and satire doesn't make me laugh at all. Postal III seems to have dropped any and all notion of satire. The humor in this game is juvenile at its best and braindead at its worst. But I'll gladly take this over Postal 2. Gameplay wise, the game is now a linear third person shooter. The open world of Postal 2 will be certainly missed. But thankfully there is a free-roam mode after you finish the game (eventhough the map size is still pathetic).As a third person shooter, the game is competent with a decent variety in weapons. And there is still the dark joy in slicing up innocents then beating someone with another person's head. But oddly enough this game has a morality meter. Killing people will give you negative points. However if you decide to go the ""Good"" path killing enemies don't give you negative points. However, if you fail optional missions you get negative points. Conversely, killing anyone in the ""Evil"" Path will give you negative points, but failing optional missions do nothing. I liked the morality meter. It somewhat rewards people who plays nice by giving you an extra mission at the end. Graphically, the game doesn't look good. It has a decent cartoony caricature-vibe going for it. But the textures are grainy, and character animations are so stiff that it surprised me that the game used the Source engine; The engine that is famous for expressive animations. Technically, the game is a mess. The game isn't coded to use multi-core by default. Resulting in lag and long loading times. The game would crash during loading screens as well. Thankfully some of the problems can be fixed by altering the files. (More info here http://nienpaper.wordpress.com/2012/02/03/postal-3-fix-performance-crash-fix/) However, even with all of that. I like this game. I don't know why. It's shamelessly dumb but maybe that was the charm. Get the game when it's on sale for like 5 bucks or less. You'll atleast get some laughs.			"

												I like the wackyness of it all, it works well with a twisted sense of humor. The game would be awsome if they would only have stuck to the standard movements of a FPS like in Borderlands, quake, etc. "

												I cannot recommend this game, I would rather play Duke Nukem Forever and I really didnt enjoy that game. This game is buggy and runs like crap. Do NOT buy this game, I should have taken the hint when it wasnt originally available on steam at launch.			"

												A letdown after Postal 2, flawed gameplay design and quite a few game breaking bugs. Expect to be booted to desktop dozens of times before you finish. Fairly interesting selection of weapons but uninspired level design, gimmicky use to second-rate celebrities, frequent choke points where the difficulty either spikes or parts of the game break that prevent you from continuing. The concept is fairly unique, a bright and colourful satire(losest sense of the term) in a world of green/brown space third person shooters, but the concept can't carry the game alone. If it's $5 on sale then go for it, just don't expect anything like Postal 2.			"

												Let's say that you're -- somehow -- a fan of Postal. You would still not enjoy this game. It doesn't break the fourth wall, the fourth wall doesn't exist in this game. You make decisions that affect the way you progress through the game, but even the joy of that is sucked out of this game... Because of this game. Not sure what made Running With Scissors take the leap from Unreal Engine in Postal 2 to Source in Postal III. Not sure what they expected in adding zombies to Postal, or forcing really annoying combat encounters, or never really giving you a moment to properly understand what's happening. This game tries too hard to be offensive, yet funny, to have stuff to do, in a world with nothing to do, to have a story in a series that never had one, and decals constantly overlap one another. Voice-acting is overall poor, and even for people that like low-brow humor (like myself) this game just takes it too far. It's not funny, it's just annoying.+ Kill Uwe Boll+ Weapons+ Postal violence- Annoying fourth wall breaks- Possibly the worst use of Source Engine I've ever seen- Glitches galore!- Annoying voice acting- Never a moment's peace to explore and just do whatever I want, like in Postal 2- Combat that's sometimes WAY too annoying- Zombies, in Postal- Tries too hard to do too many things at once			"

												I cannot fathom that I paid money for this debacle of a trainwreck. The missions make no sense, the enemies are either too stupid to kill you; or, kill you in mere seconds without any chance of you doing anything about it.       The game runs at a staggering, mindblowing, ten frames per seconds at nearly all times. The voice acting is atrocious, the NPCs could not be any more vapid and shallow. The guns are unsatisfying, and most of the other weapons are just plain stupid and have no purpose other than shock value.       I can't wrap my mind around how this ""game"" ever got the green light to get this far. Please, only consider installing this ""game"" if they pay you to do so. Stay away from this distasteful, poor designed ""game"" that was clearly made by immature ten-year-olds. Because, no matter how you slice it, it was clearly targeted for them, too. You have been warned.			"

												It lacks the spirit of Postal 2 and is fairly unstable for many.The issue people seem to have with the title is that it is so completely different from Postal 2 in so many ways folks who sat down to check it out - found it distracting to itself. Which is kind of a frustrating feeling. It kind of gives you a 'AND NOW WHAT' feeling instead of a 'OH NEAT' or 'OH COOL' feeling which is a concensus many have voiced.I however somehow contrarily find it being different pleasing. Folks who wanted a Postal 2-2 basically got it - just because RwS saw P3 as such a FkUp. I don't feel it is and its crappy to be tied to that monicre.You can ride a segway throwing cats infested with AIDS at people.What's there to complain about?A lot. But who cares, its kind of a 'its for you if you like it' title. Otherwise skip it.^And either way they'd get your bucks so $$$lol$$$$ for 'them' I guess.			"

												Really buggy, linear, and episodic. But if you wanna relieve some stress.. I mean you can put the barrel of your shotgun up a cat's butt and fire it at someone after having doused them in gasoline and set them aflame..  then pee on someone nearby so they puke on the corpse. So yeah.			"

												Postal III is the game the world never asked for, including, apparently, the series' own creators. It wasn't submitted for ESRB classification, and it's not hard to see why. It's rude, crude, and morally reprehensible. It's also admittedly fun to play for many of the same reasons the 2nd game was. The Postal Dude is an alternately hilarious and despicable everyman in a world gone mad and filled with celebrity charactures and people with guns who don't like him very much. This however, the only game in the series where the Dude gets to even remotely resemble a good guy, and that is a serious stretch. Whether you try to save the city of Catharsis through rampant police brutality or bring it to its knees as an insane criminal, you'll get to crack plenty of skulls along the way. However, this entry is so mired in bugs that many people couldn't even finish it. As it is, I had to reload my saves often. It got to the point where Running With Scissors and many of Postal 2's fans completely disowned this game. If you want to play Postal (and I wouldn't blame you if you didnt) go play Postal 2.			"
