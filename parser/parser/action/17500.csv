												This mod is a gem. Hell i wasnt even a fan of the whole zombie genre when i tried this game out of curiosity five years ago but it quickly won me over thanks to its gameplay and atmosphere. Its immersive, challenging (teamwork is a MUST) and above all, fun. An interesting aspect of the game is that you actually can play as a zombie after you died. No bot slaughterfest à la Left 4 Dead here. Its very enjoyable to fight a zombie horde composed of other players trying to overwhelm you so you can join their ranks. Zombos can also infect you which really adds to the tension since it creates a climate of suspicion among the survivors.  Most of the official maps are well designed and interesting. The character models are well made too and all have their own ""personality"" and dialogue lines which is pretty cool.Last but not least, there is a really nice variety of weapons, including several melees. There is also a barricade system that can help you to hold off the undead. I should also mention the weapon and ammo management system. Guns and ammo slow you down so hoarding ammo is not an option. The weapon/ammo weight plus a fatigue bar adds to the realism and makes being a team player an absolute necessity.If you are looking for a fun, teamwork oriented zombie survival game, give it a try. Chances are you wont be disappointed. And remember, its FREE. :)			"

												RIP Zombie Panic Source2007-2013This is one of the greatest HL2 mods ever created and I've played this for at least 2000 hours over the past 8 years but all great things must come to an end.The downfall of this great game started around 2011 when servers containing unbalanced and ridiculous mods began to appear, at first I thought nothing of it but by 2013 all the servers were infected with horrible mods...Now every single server allows survivors to spawn weapons/ammo on the go and the Point mod allows players to increase there speed and damage the more they play on the server, this completely unbalances the game and goes against everything the devs worked for.I should also mention that this type of asinine gameplay attracts asinine players so if you're looking for a competent community you're not going to find one because everyone who liked the games original design has left.RIP Zombie Panic Source2007-2013			"

If You're Reading This Now, Install This Game And Play It. You Won't Regret It.Ah, ZPS. Words cannot describe my deep love for this true gem of a game. I started playing ZPS around early 2008 on my old account, and every second of it was a blast. The atmosphere, the frantic teamwork, the soundtrack and the gunplay was once the pinnacle of 2007-era Source multiplayer. The rush of joy at your first survivor/zombie kill. The great relief of surviving a horde, only to be faced with the overwhelming pressure of being the last survivor on your team. All of this combined and much, much more gave ZPS it's once shining luster.Skip forward almost 8 years later, and ZPS is more-or-less dead. The average number of dedicated players is abysmal, developer support is non-existant, and the only thing keeping ZPS barely alive is the community. It truly is a tragedy, how much has changed in such a short time, and all for the worst.Contagion tried (and failed) to preserve the original beauty of ZPS. But with almost all of the ZPS team gone to places unkown, the true spirit of ZPS is in risk of being lost forever.Though there have been petitions on popular websites such as change.org, all we have recieved so far are empty promises from a struggling dev team. Unless something changes, and fast, the crumbling foundation of the ZPS community could very well collapse, and more quickly than we think.Therefore I pay my final ode to ZPS. Chances are, come back in a few years time, and ZPS will practically be unheard of. Hell, there may not even be a store page left to view any more. Or reviews such as this.All we, what remains of the ZPS community can do, is continue to play ZPS in the vain hope that our meager efforts will keep ZPS alive. All we can do is spread the word to new players. All we can do is build groups and servers. All we can do is demand updates and a little bit of TLC for ZPS, even though it's bound to never happen in our lifetimes.Therefore I plead you one more time; If you are new to the concept of ZPS and do not play it, click that green install button right now and launch it up. You will not regret it, trust me.That is all I have to say. Thank you for your time. "

Zombie Panic: Source - a dying, buggy, yet fun game.Rather than let the game's community affect my perspective on this game like most others, I will be basing this review on the game ONLY.Originating in December of 2007 and originally being a Source Mod for Half Life 2 Deathmatch, this game is on its final days of living unfortunately. It runs on the old Source Base 2007. It's very thrilling to play alongside your friends and have them fall to the undead, turning against you and eventually feasting on your flesh (hopefully not!).Official Game Trailer

Description:The game is quite easy to get started in, but has the typical motto of ""hard to master"". It is difficult for starting players, but you get better at the game rather quickly, so do not feel discouraged if you lose a lot in the beginning! Find the right people to play with and they'll be glad to help you out! Some servers offer modifications such as models, trails, stats, infection cure, and more. The community is slowly deteriorating away; a significantly lower amount of players play each day, but you'll currently find four to six servers with a decent amount of people.Teamwork can be very critical depending on the map, such as requiring zombies to work together in specific strategies or survivors sticking together to heighten the chance of survival, although teamwork is usually not present due to poor communication or stubborness. When survivors die they turn into zombies, having the new goal of having to kill every survivor.Survivors, depending on the map, must either survive, kill all zombies, or complete objectives, which usually ends in escaping the map.Zombies must attempt to kill all the survivors before running out of time, lives, or the survivors reaching a point. Visuals and Lag Compensation:Visuals are what you would expect from a Source mod on the 2007 engine, running Direct X 9. There are numerous visual bugs and glitches, especially from minimizing and re-opening your game, but most of them are minor and won't disturb the game too much. Shadows and flashlights will show through several surfaces and walls. Hitboxes may also show through surfaces and can be damaged, although this is uncommon.Lag compensation is quite horrid (zombies can hit you five feet away due to extended hit range) and the hit boxes can be also occasionally. Players can have the same ping and one player will still be able to have lag compensation advantage. When zombies use their lunge ability (temporary speed boost), they almost always get extended hit range. Zombies may hit you even without looking at you. Occasionally when attempting to kill a survivor using a melee weapon on you, when you get hit they'll have some invisible forcefield around them preventing you from moving closer. Even on LAN these things will occur. I've found the lag compensation to be the most bothersome when trying to enjoy the game. There's also the infamous corner peeking registry. When you quickly peek around a corner and shoot a zombie your shot will not be registered because their hitboxes are still behind the wall but their model is showing.Characters and Weapons:There are up to six survivors to choose from, all with their own unique voices and quotes, ranging from a waitress with weird breast implants to a bald police officer. They also have their own zombie counterpart. Voice acting is quite comical but sounds generic and awkward at times, such as the waitress having an odd moan when she attacks. Survivors can use voice commands as mentioned, ""panic"" which gives you a temporary stamina boost,  a flashlight, and many other actions. The starting zombie will become a zombie known as ""The Carrier"". The carrier is basically the ""alpha zombie"", having more strength, health, and the ability to infect and ""roar"".There are weapons of course, and unique melee weapons too. Some weapons include rifles, shotguns, chairs, IED explosives, grenades, and even props themselves. Several of the weapons are unbalanced, but that statement is highly subjective. Accuracy and recoil are pretty meaningless on most weapons so you can jump around like a maniac and land headshots. Two melee weapons are missing models and use the crowbar model instead. It would have been nice if console cvars were included to customize crosshairs like in most Source games; the ZPS crosshair is pretty obtrusive to me, because its dot blocks a lot of heads I try to shoot. The crosshair also becomes larger if you use lower resolutions, which can be a problem for people that like using low res like myself. Modes and Maps:Modes you can play are objective mode (ZPO), survival mode (ZPS), team arena (ZPA), and hardcore (ZPH). An additional modded mode called Deathmatch (ZPD) is present, which pits survivors versus survivors. There are also some deathrun maps. Maps are very unique and creative, some requiring imaginative barricades or dodging giant blocks fired at you, adding to the endless replayability factor. Some maps may be well balanced, or very survivor/zombie sided, as well as grotesque-looking maps with poor designs and numerous bugs, which is usually the norm now.Quite an enjoyable game to play with friends, albeit the small playerbase of today. It's free too, so it's worth a try.Pros and ConsPros:- A large variety of maps, good and bad.- Simple, creepy soundtrack.- Co-op and teamwork is the main focus of this game for both zombies and survivors.- Easy to get started in- Simple, intuitive voice commands.- Chill community.- A massive update by the new dev team will be coming later this year; you can check it out on the hub.Cons:- Numerous visual glitches and map exploits.- Extremely bad netcode and hit registry.- Rounds can become tediously delayed when fewer players are alive.- Outdated, buggy code.Replayability factor: Very high.My overall score of this game/Source mod is: 7.5/10Note: this review will be updated once the major update is released.

												The most FUN I've had in a zombie game. Zombie vs humans, that's it. human team has to barricade themselves and try to survive the attack from the zombie team, if one of them kills you, as expected you become one. The slightly tricky mechanics become simple, and after that it's all about finding a good server. Being a mod has enabled the community to do great things with scripts and maps. I personally recommend Sammys if it's still about atow.  "

												This game should be more popular than that. Let my explain why.So, you find a good server. You join the server and a new round starts. All the people press P which grants a temporary stamina boost. You're new to the game. You don't know why they're doing that so early on. (While the players character is panicking they drop all of their weapons and ammo) You take the ammo they dropped, but you notice something. 1. All the others are way ahead of you.2. You are now a slug with all those bullets.You encounter an player, he has an AK-47 and seems to have quite a good amount of ammo too. But he still runs faster than you. That's because you have your melee weapon still with you and a metric ♥♥♥♥ ton of bullets. Beside that, your weapon isn't the best, as it is only a 9mm pistol. You get killed and the Zombies win the round.Another round begins and like last time, all the players sprint off. You decide to do the same and follow them. A Zombie follows you but he can't catch up with you. Eventually, you get lost and you run out of stamina and he catches you, killing you.Again, new round. Everybody runs off, but this time you are with them. You find numerous places where the big guns spawn. You manage to get yourself an SMG and sufficient ammo, but not to much. You notice that you are still lighter than you were with the pistol and the full ammo stock. A few survivors were killed, leaving you and another player alone against the horde. You fight with him. He runs out of bullets. He asks you for some bullets, and you share with him. But  even that isn't enough. He tells you to keep them distracted and uses his panic ability again. But you are scared of the raw numbers of Zombies, and you follow him into an basement with no alternate escape route. Eventually, you are overwhelmed. So is the last survivor that you followed.3rd round. you run of to get yourself a gun, ammo and team up. It all repeats itself. with one exeption: You fight them off this time! And you get hit a few times, but you're still not dead. While you held the Zombies off, your teammate did the objectives and you manage to escape. Congratulations!This little story here is similiar to how I started out playing. It teaches you to share ammo, work together and communicate.  It's an competitive game, you won't win by yourself. (Well...rarely)1. Don't carry to much ammo, instead, share!2. Learn the spots for all those goodies waiting. In the late stages of a match your pistol isn't going to do the job. (Small clip, slow rate of fire etc.3. Don't be scared to take a few hits. ""Normal"" Zombies can't infect you with one exception: The Carrier (a.k.a Whitey)He has a chance to infect playersI just realised this is more of a tutorial than a review. But hey, still shows how much fun it can be if you work together or with friends. "

There's a ton of levels made by the creators and then even more levels made by the community! It's worth at least looking up on youtube. The best level would be the farmhouse.

												This is a GEM of a game. It's always fun, it never gets old, and with the release of 3.0 coming eventually, i'm super hyped to see how many players it will bring in! Don't let my hours fool you. I have over 100 hours in total on this game.Before I list the pros and cons, I just want to say this: As a veteran player, I urge you to play this game if you haven't yet, and since I haven't seen any sort of community hub, I have created one on discord which I hope will grow over time, and become the go-to place for all things ZPS. Here is the link to that discord. https://discord.gg/m82aXCC. Not only is the discord server for discussion, it's also got a section for servers, game updates, and a bug/glitch report section.now for the actual review.PROS*nice sound design*detailed maps*ability to create custom maps*good team system*amazing music*tons of replayability*hasn't aged a bitCONSI don't really have any cons to list. The ones I do have are all PLAYER caused.Such as: hackers; squeakers; mic spammers; people who purposely cause the game to never end by not doing something they need to, or hiding the item the humans need to progress.

												Good Half-Life 2 mod but was sadly abandoned due to the (not-so-great) developer's decision to only focus on his new game Contagion that features reworked classic maps from this game. However, the game is dead with only a few servers left which I could probably name right now. Most of the players aren't on Steam and don't speak English no matter what the server rules say. Although it's free, I can't recommend it simply due to the fact that the developer abandoned it and the playerbase is lacking and the little that is left isn't great at all.			"

												Notice: The Contagion developers seem to be so busy with their retail game that ZPS' updating has slowed to a crawl, if it's even being updated anymore. I would really, really like for a developer or two to give evidence that I'm wrong, as I still love ZPS and would prefer that it does not befall the same fate as it's GoldSrc brother, Zombie Panic.TL;DR: As much as I like it, I simply cannot recommend any new players to try this game out. The difficulty curve at this point in time is frustrating for beginners, as a great majority of the community left is veterans. Development has practically ceased in favor of Contagion. ZPS is actively dying. Balance needs fixing, badly.Ladies and gentlemen, Zombie Panic Source. This was a great mod back in its prime. I would go so far as to say it was one of the best, if not THE best, multiplayer SMods of its time. An update on February 11, 2011 (if i recall correctly) made the game even more difficult by ""fixing"" knockback, though this made things even harder for Survivors when attempting to win. It has not been ""re-broken"" since, adding to the steep difficulty curve for humans.Was one of the best SMods of it's time. Not anymore.It's core idea is this: two teams, humans and zombies, are 100% player-controlled, battling for either the sake of humanity or for the world to be a bit more overrun with undead. Unlike Contagion, there is no AI here. None. Every single moving entity is controlled by a living, human being. It also is unlike Left 4 Dead in the sense that humans are not able to take tons and tons of damage; with normal health and no armor, four scratches (3 from the Carrier) and you're dead. Meanwhile, Zombies literally eat bullets for breakfast, and it's gonna take a lot to their face for them to fall. This game encourages teamwork, but it is not mandatory, meaning you could totally be a jerk and leave your fellow survivors to die and still win. That being said, there's the chance that they will come back with a vengeance, making your job of surviving much harder than before. Every bullet and survivor counts.Unfortunately, in a game like this, balance is always an issue, and right now there is a lack thereof. When knockback was fixed on zombies, instead of bullets pushing them back, zombies are ""slowed down"" instead, and sometimes this mechanic doesn't even work properly. What's worse is that smart zombies can actually power through the sluggish spells, maiming survivors even as they panic to get away.It has been over a year now since the last update. Contagion, the successor to this mod, is not looking much better. The community is dying, servers becoming more and more empty by the minute. Some groups do attempt to keep it alive, like the Specialist League, but it only does so much for the game. ZPS desparately needs an update or two, but there's no indicator in sight, as made clear by game news updates for Contagion in the Zombie Panic Source feed.On a more personal note, ZPS is the reason I found Steam in the first place--that's why it sucks so much to see it die.

												A zombie survival-themed cooperative game in which you have to face hordes of zombies. The concept may seem like a cliche within the genre but the gamemode's entertaining nature easily makes it a great must-have as a Half-Life 2 Mod. Starting as a human might be hard for newcomers but the learning curve isn't all too steep as the game requires both teamwork and tactics to accomplish the objectives in the game.I've noticed that a noticeable percentage of reviews bash the gameplay while playing as a zombie for being too slow and tedious. Having played gamemodes like L4D2 and Zombie Survival on Gmod, I agree to a certain extent while at the same time, I find the overall experience to be really satisfying. If you have friends to play Zombie Panic: Source with, don't miss the chance.			"

												+ it is free!+ eerie atmosphere (on most maps)+ good, fitting music+ many good maps+ slow, objective based gameplay (patience, ammo conservation and focus on objectives are essential)+ medium to high difficulty (depending on map)+ game runs fine on low spec/old computers- graphics are dated- some parts of the game seem unfinished, i.e. some animations are very basic- playing as zombie is boring- survival game mode can be unfair for zombies- exploits on some maps- low player count- the simplest maps (Cabin and Church) are the most popularConclusion: Great, free zombie shooter, better than many pay to play zombie games. Casuals and unexperienced FPS players might not enjoy it though because difficulty level is pretty high.The biggest problem of the game is that most players play only the simplest maps, Cabin and Church, which means that servers that host the good, challenging maps don't get enough players.

This game is amazing!Till this day it is still my favorite survivor/zombie game of all time.So what makes this game so good? It features fryingpans and chairs as melee weapons Well, there's a bunch of reasons. For me it's mainly because the game features ""traditional"" zombies (somewhat slow moving, deadly in numbers etc.) unlike many modern ""zombie""-games that feel more like battling aliens or mutants. I like the old traditional zombie style of the only weapon available to the zombies being their claws and teeths. This doesn't make the game boring when you play as the zombies though! You'll always have many possible ways to bring doom upon the humans. Hide in the darkness and strike when the time is right, or swarm the remaining survivors with your fellow zombies in an all-out zombie horde rush? it's all up to you!Playing as the survivors is also great fun! The game mainly has 2 gamemodes being played: ""Objective"" mode where you are put in a situation where you need to complete certain objectives to get the hell out of there before every single survivor has been eaten alive! The second gamemode is all about the survivors trying to stay alive at the location they're already at. After the survivors kill X amount of zombies, they win.... If they're not dead by then.Another thing I really like about the game is the atmosphere and the incredibly fun skill-""curve"" in the game. When you've played for a while and become a skilled player, you will likely have learned the maps and weapons so well that you can take on more zombies than ever before! An example could be the very powerful weapon: The magnum. With this gun, a skilled player can take down 6 zombies with 6 bullets unlike the regular starting pistols that won't kill with 1 bullet to the head. As you learn more about the guns you'll also learn how to properly save ammo and when to use which weapon. important thing though: Be sure to share weapons with your teammates if all they have is a baseball bat and a pistol with 2 bullets! Be sure to share both weapons & ammo. Teamwork is very important in the game, no matter if you're human or zombie. Humans need to stay together to have a chance to survive, and zombies also need to go together in alot of situations (unless ambushing) to have a chance at killing survivors while facing large amounts of gunfire and fryingpans. How can you not want to try out a game that lets you chair/fryingpan zombies to death?All in all a really good game that I think any fan of survivor games should try out.			"

Don't ever pick up wrong caliber bullet box for your gun noobs, or your heavy inventory will slow you down and your brain will be eaten by zombies.

												Most likely the BEST FREE ZOMBIE Game and HL2 MOD. Following right up, I decided to include the game's controls (and a little bit of trivia) in this review because people ask too many questions about this and it takes some time to memorize and get used to everything:BASIC CONTROLS: (Qwerty / English Keyboard)Mouse 1 - Attack / Shoot.Mouse 2 - Plant your IED / Push stuff (need to be empty handed as a survivor to do that, though); Zombies have a greater push force.Mouse 3 / Middle Mouse Button  (I find this a very useful control instead of the average V) - Voice chat (All-Talk).Y - Chat.U - Team chat (use it to contrive sneaky strategies with your team).WASD - Mobility.1/2/3/4/5 - Select specific items from your inventory. Scroll also works to change between items.E - Use things such as medkits / pills, doors, etc. (as survivor or sometimes depending on the map as zombie too) / Pick up your barricades (this won't reset their health though) or IED.Q - Switch to your previous weapon.R - Reload your weapon (you can always cancel the reload animation by switching quickly between weapons; this is useful because if there's incoming threat, you know what to do, don't reload, unload your entire d*mn clip on the zombies); Press it to turn the boards in your desired direction / As the Carrier, use the special ability: Roar (this activates a yellow aura around your body and makes zombies in your team, spawn closer to you and be able to see where you are from any point of the map).F  - Turn your flashlight on / off (flashlights do have a life, it lasts between 20-25 second but they regen when they're off). If you're a zombie, this key activates the zombie vision which enables you to see survivors clearly in the dark.G - Drop the current item you're holding.H - Put away / Holster your item (this is usually done so that you can push objects to barricade a place).L - Change from the old to the new zombie vision (the new one helps you see pitch black areas). Trust me, don't do it.SHIFT - Walk, as survivor (walking saves up your stamina). // Sprint, as zombie (use it wisely because this eats up your Feed-o-Meter bar) / When your bar is flashing red, activate Berserk mode to run and attack faster!Z - Taunt (no, this isn't TF2, if that's what you're thinking) / Cuss the zombies.X and C - Voice commands.V - Switch between ammo type.T - Drop the selected ammo type / or armor.B - Change the amount of ammo you want to drop (you can drop all the ammo, the whole magazine, half a magazine or a single round for a specific ammo type). There are 4 types of ammo. Pistol, shotgun, rifle and magnum.J - Pull out your Nokia and use it as a brick weapon (nah, just joking). Use it to detonate your IED (Improvised Explosive Device) by pressing M2, but be cautious, maintain your distance or take cover, otherwise you'll end up nuking yourself as well.O - Brings up the objectives list (if I were you I'd unbind that sh*t because it's really annoying since it's close to P).P - The key that gives a meaning to the game's title. Use it to PANIC. When you panic, adrenaline rushes in your veins and what this basically means is that you'll get a temporary speed boost but the con of this is that you drop all your things (weapons, ammo, etc. not the phone though, because Man can't survive without it) except the current item you're holding and armor (if you have it).CHARACTERS & ZOMBIES:By default, in the multiplayer tab, there are currently 6 playable characters. You can either choose which one you want or keep it at random. Each survivor's character starts with 100HP and doesn't have any advantage over another. Each character has their voices, lines and own zombie model. In the zombie team, there's a special bald, brawny and pale-white zombie called the Carrier (because he carries the virus; however, the community prefers calling him by Whitey / YT). This zombie has an additional 50HP than regular zombies (making a total of 250HP), moves a bit faster, deals greater damage (35HP instead of 25HP), has a special ""Roar"" ability and has a normal 10% chance of infecting a survivor (this value changes greatly in hardcore mode). Infected survivors appear green and will turn into a zombie in 30 to 60 seconds.There are currently 3 POPULAR TYPES OF GAMEMODES spread across various maps:- Maps that start with ZPS are survival maps (E.G.: Zps_Cinema);- Maps that start with ZPO are objective maps (Zpo_Biotec);& finally, for the last popular* gamemode we have maps that start with ZPH which stands for ""hardcore"" (Zph_Drinage).*There's also one more gamemode starting with ZPA which stands for ""apocalypse"" (E.G.: Zpa_Badbayou), but I won't be discussing it because it's boring and nobody plays that sh*t.- SURVIVAL maps are basically where the survivors make a last stand to eliminate all zombies. Survivors in this mode usually camp and barricade themselves in a room or hold a position in an open area (if things go bad, they have where to go). Zombies, however, need to be cautious because they have a limited amount of lives (they start with around 20 lives, give it a few more) and thus, need to strategize on the best way to get the survivors. For each kill you get, as a zombie in this gamemode, you earn one life for you and your teammates (if there are a few zombies left, this is crucial).- OBJECTIVE maps aren't really meant to be camped, just follow the instructions given to you by the map, do the objectives and try to help out your team (that includes holding a position temporarily / camping for a bit and guarding your teammates). Zombies have infinite lives in this gamemode (same for hardcore) and need to hinder the survivors from doing the objectives.- HARDCORE maps speak for themselves. These types of maps are mostly running away from zombies and platforming instead of trying to kill them, and surviving for 5 straight minutes. There's a very good reason why people don't mess around with zombies because all the weapons (except melee weapons) deal less damage (50%) to zombies (for example a magnum revolver takes 2 headshots to kill a normal zombie instead of 1) and the Carrier has a 100% chance of infecting people on hit; there can also be multiple Carriers in this mode (so, caution is advised).^ (I'm only referring to official and classic maps.) ^PROS:- Unique game;- Friendly and helpful community (except the griefers and people that watch you die).CONS:- Not many servers to play in (but there are always servers);- It crashes a lot (like, you can't play 2 maps in a row without it crashing once);- Easy to grief wherever there are doors to open.- Terrible hitboxes.Don't fret though, all of this should be fixed in the next update and there should be more servers running then. Speaking of the next update, there's gonna be some graphic and FPS improvements, since this game is going to finally run on multicores instead of only 1 core, now that Source SDK 2013 is going to be implemented and substituted by current Source SDK 2007.IMPORTANT MENTIONS:- Remember that, when playing this game, your team likes a teamplayer. Be sure to do something useful for your team (Example: share ammo, weapons and cover your teammates; attack together, as a zombie);- You should definitely try the magnum and the sledgehammer (1 hit in the head on all zombies except the Carrier; they deal 240 damage and 225, respectively);- Weapons and ammo have weights, take up different inventory spaces and have different recoils. Melee weapons have different ranges and knockbacks (sledgehammer having the strongest).Despite the cons, this game is still worth it.			"

												Perhaps one of the greatest mods that I have ever played. I've enjoyed Zombie Panic! ever since it was a mod back in Half-Life.. it was great then, and still amazing today. That fact that zombies are controlled by other online players and not AI is what seperates this zombie game from the rest.This game has a few different games modes; Objective, Survival, and Hardcore.Objective: Survivors must defense against the Zombies while doing the listed objectives. There are often numerous objectives to be completed in an Objective map in order for Survivors to win the round, and the type of objective can vary depending on the map. Zombies have an unlimited supply of respawns in this game mode.Survival: Zombies have a limited number of respawns, and Survivors must eliminate all of them. Zombies may win the round if they can overrun the Survivor team before their number of respawns are depleted. If all Zombie respawns are depleted and the final zombies are eliminated, Survivors will win.			"

												This is something I highly recommend! It's fun to play with friends, laugh along with one another as the zombies eat someone you despise. Objectives where your team must work together to survive. Survival where it's every man for himself, or if you enjoy teams go for that. You can play as a human; shooting heads off with a magnum or hitting them with a keyboard, or if you prefer to nom your way to victory then you can also play as a zombie. If you can get this mod and play it once with good company and forgiving teammates (since it will be your first time ;) ) then I suggest you download it now and play it and love it!

												For a mod as old as it is, Zombie Panic Source still has a thriving community, even when other mods of its era have dried up and died (such as Synergy or Zombie Master).Zombie Panic Source's gameplay is alright. It's nothing too awful nor ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Each round starts with a large amount of survivors and a small amount of Zombies. The Zombie's task is, obviously, to kill the humans and infect them, and the Survivors have to hold them off. At the beginning of each round, the Survivors have a short amount of time to explore, switch out their weapons, pick up ammo, and fortify themselves against the Zombie horde. It's kind of fun to play with people and discover new tactics for each map. Older players pretty much know all the little nooks and crannies like the back of their hand.I have to say that the game is a bit biased towards the zombies, or as far from what I've played. The servers that I've played on have endless respawn rates for the Zombies, and the rounds have a time limit of 10 minutes for the Survivors to hold out. Most of the time it ends with all the Survivors getting mowed over. This is, however, from my own experience and I haven't played this game  too  much to know how every server works.Regardless, from what I've played, I have to say this game is alright. It's really 50/50 whether you'll like it or not. It's not a game where you can expect to survive easily, or get a lot of kills or whatever. It's just a fun time killer. That's about it.			"

												After a long time I decided to rewrite my review to make it look less boring/silly.So here we go..First off let's leave some constructive feedback:This mod is very old, but still pretty fun, especially if you have a decent maps running on the server and playing with the good people, not with insolent russian fools who doesn't communicate with foreign players at all, insults them without any reason and camps all the time.So far I have a good experience with the game on my own, although I started playing this wrong back in 2010. I played too much on maps like ""Cabin"", ""Church"" and so on, which is my small sin in this game. But later I found a better place to play the game how it was intended to be played. ""ByFly ZPS"" server was one of the best servers back in the day when I was new to it. I found many good friends there and still remember that server with the love. When it was shut down in 2012 and all players went to other games. I had no way to go, but come back to those awful Cabin 24/7 servers, because they were the only ones online.. So it was a good time to move to Zombie Master (and later to Contagion in 2013) and I forgot about ZPS for a while.After some time I came back to ZPS after the moment when Contagion development stuck on dead spot in 2015.But even in 2014-2015 ZPS have suffered from the same problem in addition to one drama, which I don't want to write about here since you can read about it on forums if you wonder. But now the game is coming back to life though. The 3.0 update is getting closer.			"

												I want to say that I played this game for the community and the amount of fun and excitment it could generate. Sure the maps that people generally prefered got more terrible and campy but damn I loved this game. I admined for a long time in it and like to think we all shared something special by playing this unique game together. Time has passed but I'm currently downloading this to play it again in hopes that the community hasn't turned into a a collection of unskilled and overly cautious players that only play garbage maps where it sucks to play zombie. That was, in fact, the direction it was headed when I last played it years ago. Here goes nothing.			"

A game that lends itself perfect for being played time and time again.  The Design With its impressive take on the zombie apocalypse, the game provides dark and creepy invironments, terrifying enemies and really immersive gameplay. The smooth and fairly simple controls gives the game a sort arcadic approach to a zombie game, mixing together survival horror with FPS action similar to what is seen in games like Quake and Half-Life. The game practically ensures that you're always playing the game, even after you die; You may spawn as an survivor at the start of the round but be killed and you get to face your former teammates as part of the zombie horde. The only timeout you'll face will be when zombies run out of lives on the survival gamemode which usually doesn't last more than a few minutes.  The Gameplay Each team requires different ways of thinking and playing the game; Survivors require more attention to scavenging and fatigue, zombies require more strategical thinking - knowing the right place and time to ambush the survivors to ensure the best outcome for your team. Zombies have to rely on their strength in numbers, like the survivors, but much more crucial to ensure a zombie win. Leading the zombie horder is the Carrier, referred to as 'Whitey', who has greater speed and attack damage than your regular zombie, while also possessing the ability to act as a beacon that guides you towards his location and lets you respawn close to him. Survivors have a large arsenal of weapons to use; Ranging from assualt rifles to kitchen equipment. In tough times, they can gain a temporarily stamina boost by 'panicking', allowing them a chance to flee the horde of zombies that have them overwhelmed. With excellent maps that allow for both high-paced actions but also incredible world building through their atmosphere and surroundings, with the randomness that occur from facing real players and their given strategy, each round is bound to be different. This variation in gameplay is only strengthen by the different gamemodes that the game has to offer such as survival, objective, assault and hardcore - each switching things up in their own respect.  The Community Looking past the amazing design of the game, what has kept me invested since 2009 when I started playing, is the amazing community. While a minority, mainly due to the previous years of no updates and the spread of content foreign to the orignal game design, there still exist a dozen of dedicated players who have been willing to support the game through years of no developer support, server attacks and infinite problems related to the game's outdated code and engine. Because of the effort of the community, a developer team has now been brought back and is in full swing on releasing the next, major update. A update that will see the game on a new engine, with depth added to the game's lore and characters, and a major overhaul of the original code - creating a solid fundation that can then be expanded upon. This game is a great example of what a community can do when its favorite game is abandoned by its developers because of financial and creative reasons. The power lies with the players, and the community has finally brought the game back to hopefully revive the game close to its former glory. If you're thinking 'Hey! This guy is a developer so his opinion is biased, then note that I only recently became one. My review is based upon 7 years of almost exclusively playing this game. I guess that lends itself for a bias, too, but it is also evidence of how great this game is!  "

												A free mod, if you have a Source Engine running game, like Hl2, CSS etc.Thanks to Half-life 1, Zombie Panic was spawned and thus after Hl2, a source engine running ZP was made as you see here.Mainly really only a multiplayer game, players start out having to survive or escape the map, following objectives.Soon after round start a random player will be picked to become a ""special"" zombie, one that has a larger chance of infecting players. When a player dies, they become a zombie themselves and must help kill out the rest of the surviving players.Around the map you can find different sorts of weapons, ranging from melee to long/close range based weapons. The game also uses a ammo system, which you can decide what kind of ammo type and how much you want to drop. You see, the more you carry, the more burden you get, and become slower. You become a easy target for a swarm of zombies.Items also include health packs, pills, body armor and wooden planks you can use to board against windows or doors to keep out zombies for a small amount of time.The mod has a thriving community with a decent amount of servers, and there's loads of custom maps incase you become bored of the usual classic maps.Overall I would highly recommend this mod if you enjoy zombie games.

												Zombie Panic! Source is a game that puts you into a scenario that has you fight out zombies or if you're the zombie then you fight the humans. This game satisfies your need to be put at bashing a zombie's brains in or eating humans. Will you become dinner as a human? Well, that's if you don't work together to fight off zombies, and be careful, Getting somebody killed just may make him reanimate into the dead to feast your brains off!-Gameplay:The gameplay is quite a good experience, but there's a problem that has to do with the range with the zombie's arms because you can get hit from about 6-10 feet. I really also don't like how there is weight to ammo since you need almost a pistol clip (USP) to finish off just one zombie so ammo goes fast and you can't carry much so you'll need to be very good with your ammo.-Gamemodes:There is three gamemodes in this game. First we'll go over ZPS. ZPS is just surviving since you cannot kill all the zombies due to unlimited lives. ZPO is objective orientated in which you must kill off zombies AND DO objectives to win. This gamemode needs absolute teamwork for this gamemode to have the smoothest experience. ZPH is hardcore and the zombie lives are unlimited like ZPS, but to win you need to live 5 minutes and you spawn with the poorest weapons possible, PPK and the keyboard-Final Saying:This game is very fun when your teammates actually work together to defeat zombies and finish objectives (ZPO Maps only), so the final rating is 8.8/10 Which is pretty good. Also the background music fits the game very, very well. Well that wraps up this review.-Dead Kitty out			"

												Just awesome! I wish the store page wasn't so badly outdated, but oh well. Anyway...This game seems simple, but it gets EXTREMELY complicated...The game modes are rather simple, there are more or less 6 modes:Survival- survivors need to euthanize all the zombies, which have limited lives.Objective- survivors complete tasks in order to escape or secure a locationTimed Survival- zpo maps where survivors need to last for a pre-determined amount of time.Annex- Both teams have endless lives, but fight over control points to winHardcore- Tougher zombies, there are higher infection rates, but survivors only need to live for 5 minutes to win.Deathrun- survivors need to complete a gauntlet, while zombie try to kill them with traps.Zombies have endlesss lives on most maps, and one goal: EAT YOUR FACE! The twist? They're all players, and these zombies can take a beating, and move at a decent pace, but the real problem is that they have REAL intelligence (most players anyway) and they WANT YOU DEAD! Because if you die, you turn into a zombie! Most rounds end in disaster because of this, but it makes Surviving all the more sweet. That and half the fun is when you are a zombie.Most players start rounds as a survivor, but a few will be zombies. And one lucky player will be the carrier, with an extra 50 HP, more damage per swipe, the ROAR ability, and the chance to infect survivors, who will soon turn into a friend. Best played like a zombie ninja. Hiding in the shadows, waiting for somebody to run by, then BAM! Eat their brains! Or drop on them from above, when someone is alone, or use the Roar to attract clueless zombies towards the last Human stronghold.Not like the survivors are pushovers though. You can out run zombies rather easily when you don't have anything, And there are a LOT of weapons. There are 9mm pistols, common, but rather handy if you are skilled with them, best used against lone Z's. Magnums, which blow off heads with 1 bullet. Shotguns, which can blow away Z's with bodyshots at close range, and Rifles, which are hard to use well, but slaughter zombies quickly.There's more! Explosives can kill whole hoards, Just be sure to cook your grenades first, and to try to lure as many zombies around a IED as possible. Throwing a IED around a corner and detonating it works wonders. Last, but no longer ussless, melee weapons are plentiful, varied, and powerful! They were overhauled August 2012, so they don't suck anymore. Matter of fact, they are VERY deadly in the right hands now! Frying Pan for the win.But don't grab too much crap, though. Everything weighs you down, and if you take everything, other people will likely die, and/or yell at you. Not to mention that your stamina will drain faster too, leaving you at risk when zombies are coming!I haven't even mentioned the music, maps, or anything else yet. The music is top notch, I can't do it justice with my words. The stock maps are great as well, It makes me sad that noobs prefer crappy Deathrun and silly Objective maps that are poorly crafted over the fantastic stock Survival maps. Not to say that the custom maps are all rubbish though. There are lots of great ones, and one of the current stock maps used to be a custom map.  The player models and view models are all decent, and the voice acting is surprisingly good.In short, if you played ZPS a long time ago, it's likely better now. Everything has been improved. Except the hilarious animations, which should never change. If you've never played it, you have missed a TON of wild fun. But there are still enough active servers to find a good match, and this game can be run on a toaster. So what are you waiting for? PANIC!Disclaimer: This is the option of somebody that has played more then 800 hours of ZPS, thus may be baised towards likeing said title. In game information is based on approximate the current status of title. Game CANNOT be run on a actual toaster. Toaster is a metaphor for a crappy computer. Servers are active as of Friday, May 20th, 2016 What a wall of text!			"

As I said before, you need teamwork, and if the players succeed that limit, you will have a good time playing, and survive longer. What I say is just have other friends play this game and join a server so you can at least work something out with them. So, in a nutshell, this game a gem of a zombie game, but the only thing bad about it is (rarley) the glitches and (mostly) people not wanting to share ammunition or health packs, so basicly teamwork. So, what are you waiting for? Stop reading this review and download the game! "

												Amazing game. Plenty of good maps, has the unique feature of playing as a survivor or the dead. It's no wonder people still play this game after all these years. Anyway, watch out for whitey and the car in garage on the map cabin ( I've killed many fellow survivors with it lel ^u^) This game = 10/10			"

												Zombie Panic! Source was a great game, but these days people play mostly variations of Cabin and Church, which are the simplest and most undemanding maps the game has to offer, so if you don't like monotonous camping and easy wins, you will have a hard time finding a populated server.

												Let me give you a basic gestalt.The Elite are all about transcendence, and living forever, and the secrets of the Universe... We are on this planet, and Einstein's physics showed it, Max Planck's physics showed it: there's at least 12 dimensions, and all the top scientists and billionaires are coming out, saying it's a false hologram. It is artificial; the computers are scanning it and finding tension points where it's artificially projected, and gravity is bleeding into this universe - that's what they call dark matter - so we are like a thought or a dream that's a wisp in some computer program, some God's mind or whatever.... There is this ""Sub-transmission Zone"" below the third dimension which is turned over to the most horrible things - that's what it resonates to - and it's trying to get up into the third dimension (that's just a basic level consciousness, to launch into the next levels.) And our species is already way up at the fifth/sixth dimension consciousnally [SIC] (our best people). But there's this war, trying to basically destroy Humanity, because Humanity has free will. And there's a decision - which level we want to go to. We have free will, so Evil is allowed to come and contend (and not just good). And the Elites themselves believe they are racing, using human technology, to try to take our best minds and build some type of breakaway civilization, where they are going to merge with machines, transcend and break away from the 'failed species' that is Man...Google believes the first AI will be a supercomputer based on the neuron activity of the 'hive-mind' of humanity, with billions of people wired into the 'Internet of Things.' And so all of our thoughts go into it, and we are actually building a computer that has real neurons, in real time, that is also psychically connected to us that are organic creatures. So that they will have current prediction powers, future prediction powers, a true 'crystal ball.' But the big secret is, once you have the 'crystal ball' and know the future, you can add stimuli beforehand and make decisions that control the future. And so then it's the end of consciousness and free will for individuals as we know it, and a true ""2.0"" in a very bad way. Hive-mind consciousness with an AI jacked into everyone, knowing our hopes and dreams, delivering it to us - not into some ""P.K.D. Wire-head System"" where we plug in and give up on consciousness because of unlimited pleasure - but because we were already wired in and absorbed before we knew it, by giving over our consciousness to this system by our daily decisions that it was able to manipulate and control into a larger system...The Devil, whatever you want to call this interdimensional thing that gives them advanced off-world technology, The Fallen One that's not of this world, is giving them advanced knowledge on how to construct these systems that have already been used before on other populations... This is an interdimensional force that wants to influence us to build something that absorbs us and kills us, rather than the Divine free will we are given to build something much better that empowers the species. So the species is now making a decision about its entire future... They believe we are this ugly, fallen, ugly species: we all need to be killed, they are the rich billionaires who are better than us, and they are going to merge with machines and become Gods and go to the next level.

												Zombie Panic Source is after all this years still the game that comes closest to the essential topic of a zombie game.Especially in the last few years with Day-Z and the following boom of like-ish games this game was always something different.ZPS gives you the unsettling feeling to never be safe, no matter how good you are equipped or how good your boarded up room is secured - ammo is limited, the dead are always on your back and the survivor you play with could have gotten infected in the last attack. And once you are gone you join the undead ( Romero true there are no special infected - only the hordes of the undead) and you can hunt down the guys who saved your ♥♥♥ just 2 minutes prior.I had really a lot of fun in this game - and the fact that its still somewhat active after all this years ( in a time where game servers die after a couple of years) already says a lot.And the best news is - a new team of devs started to work again on this game ( September 2016 ).So if you look again through your hundreds of games in your libary and dont know what to play - just give ZPS a try.It´s free and all you can lose is your interest for every other game for some time ;D			"

												A really nice game for killing boredom, it's pretty hard to get a hang of it at first, but when you do, it's really fun. There are no particular OP weapons, some are better if you're good at aiming, like the revolver, and some are better for you if you're a casual player who doesn't play much FPS games, like the shotguns or automatic weapons. Being a human is very fun in a way - you're scared that they'll kill you, and that's normal, because you become a zombie afterwards, that makes people want to survive more. Also, being a zombie is not that bad as well, if you're a zombie at the beggining of the round, you become a so-called carrier, you can infect people, do more damage and have more hp, so it eliminates the drawback of not playing a human from the beggining.I love the inventory weight aspect, you can't carry an arsenal on you, it slows you down. The ammo has the biggest impact on your weight, so that makes you take a decision what to take, and what to leave.The graphics are not mind-blowing, but me myself, i don't care that much about the graphics, my PC is old, so i'm used to it. The good thing is that the game can be run by 5-7yrs old computers, and that's neat for people that can't afford better hardware.Overall, i'm giving it an 8/10			"

												Wonderful mod, i recommend anyone who likes either shooting or zombie games to check this out. A very unique this about this game is the PvP and the fact that you can use your environment to give yourself an advantage. Not many zombie survival games allow that. It is also free and available for anyone who wants it, since NMRiH is free andn if you want this you can just download NMRiH (and theyre both zombie games so if you're are interested in zombie games then this is a double win). The game is challenging for both parties. Zombies need to break into places, work together to push things around and get to the survivors. Survivors need to hold out and work together to barricade and get rid of zombies. Everyone needs to do their part to survive. However a huge downside is the zombie players need to know what their doing or else the game is incredibly boring. My friend disliked this game when the zombies just ran around and he got bored. Many people just go afk when they die and become zombies too. Then again, I guess that just comes with all PvP games. Even with that downside I still highly recommend this game. What I love about this game is how it isnt a braindead ""on my first try i got 30 kills and survived"" game like a lot of games are today. You need to use common sense and figure things out like you would have to in real life. You can't depend on the game babying you or just leaving and making your teammates defend while you are jumping around doing nothing. A great part of this game is the necessity to work together, or everyone dies. It is also really fun to play with friends. Whoever created this game is a genius and needs to be rewarded.			"

												Honestly, this is one of the best free games where I've had the most fun and time wasted.An exceptional FPS, with a great community. Gameplay almost never gets repetitive, with numerous maps and unique players. Visuals are what you'd expect from a Source mod. Teamwork can be very critical depending on the map, such as requiring zombies to work together in specific strategies or survivors sticking together to heighten the chance of survival. Lag compensation is quite horrid and the hit boxes can be also which makes me deduct a point on the score. The game is quite easy to get started in, but has the typical motto of ""hard to master"". Some servers also offer modifications such as models, trails, stats, infection cure, and more. The community is still very strong, with hundreds of players still each day.Some maps may be well balanced, or very survivor/zombie sided. Survivors can use various weapons including melee and explosives. Survivors can also use voice commands, ""panic"", flashlight, and many other actions. Zombies must attempt to kill all the survivors before running out of time, lives, or the survivors reaching a point. The carrier is basically the 'alpha zombie', having more strength, health, and the ability to infect and 'roar'.Modes you can play are objective mode (ZPO), survival mode (ZPS), team arena (ZPA), and hardcore (ZPH). There are also some deathrun maps. Some maps may require you to barricade. Some may require you to dodge blocks fired at you. The maps are very unique.My overall score of this spectacular game/ Source mod is: 9/10			"

												One of the best zombie games on the market, second only to the left for dead series, the maps are great, the zombies are prime and the mods are expansive. this game is imersive and keeps you wanting more. I highly recommend zombie panic source.			"

												Honestly, this is one of the best free games where I've had the most fun and time wasted.An exceptional FPS, with a great community. Gameplay almost never gets repetitive, with numerous maps and unique players. Visuals are what you'd expect from a Source mod. Teamwork can be very critical depending on the map, such as requiring zombies to work together in specific strategies or survivors sticking together to heighten the chance of survival. Lag compensation is quite horrid and the hit boxes can be also which makes me deduct a point on the score. The game is quite easy to get started in, but has the typical motto of ""hard to master"". Some servers also offer modifications such as models, trails, stats, infection cure, and more. The community is still very strong, with hundreds of players still each day.Some maps may be well balanced, or very survivor/zombie sided. Survivors can use various weapons including melee and explosives. Survivors can also use voice commands, ""panic"", flashlight, and many other actions. Zombies must attempt to kill all the survivors before running out of time, lives, or the survivors reaching a point. The carrier is basically the 'alpha zombie', having more strength, health, and the ability to infect and 'roar'.Modes you can play are objective mode (ZPO), survival mode (ZPS), team arena (ZPA), and hardcore (ZPH). There are also some deathrun maps. Some maps may require you to barricade. Some may require you to dodge blocks fired at you. The maps are very unique.My overall score of this spectacular game/ Source mod is: 9/10			"

												A game that is very nostalgic to me because its one of the first I've loved. At this point, the game has only two maps, both community made. The original maps are only played on one server that is not usually populated. This game is very good to this day and I highly suggest Contagion as well.			"

												This game is awesome. Nuff said. Since 2010 when I started light pc gaming on my pentium 4 machine, this game was my first steam game and I loved it. I don't spend a lot of time playing pc games but the 50 hours that I have spent playing this game could be 1000 easy. It's always fun and the game is never the same each round even if you play on a map that specialises in 24/7 of one map e.g. back in the day there was a server dedicated to 24/7 biotec and it was awesome! I still enjoy this even though that its not as popular as back when I started. This is a solid game and I will keep enjoying it for time to come.			"

												If you're into a realistic zombie shoot 'em up, there is nothing better. I can honestly think of nothing as good as this. Obviously, not too popular with folks, who only care about their CoD, or L4D, this game really shines when you have your friends playing with you, and you have a good objective map with you. This game also has the advantage of an extremely experienced mod team, the amount of quality of this simple mod is just breathtaking.Pros-Realism, promotes teamwork-Balanced game, zombies actually can get kills, ammo and guns aren't just everywhere-Even a newbie can play zombie correctly, with a bit of logicCons-Realism puts some people off, means lack of community-Game induces considerable rage, not a stress reliever-Small amount of servers, especially Australian onesAll in all, I give this a 9/10			"

												Ive played Zombie Panic for as long as i remember.  I downloaded it in 2010 when there were MANY servers, im talking an easy  150 servers... Unfortunately the game has kinda been swept under the rug with time and especially because of Contagion being released.  The game though is fun, exciting, and even at times...scary!  It is true that most people dont work with you to survive, but you will find a good soul in the bunch.  All in all, if youre still on the fence of deciding to play it; just give it a try experiece will depend on which server you play on (there are about 4 or 5 servers under 100 ping.)  What i like is that the developers haven't given up on it.  There have been a few updates and addons to the game.  Go on give it a try...Just remember to watch your back...			"

												My review on ""Mar 12, 2013 @ 5:01pm""A ""free"" zombie game SO worth trying out! It's my first and favorite steam game and will always be! I love this game for the awesome players, simple but fun gameplay, and wonderful memories...with that I will always go back for more! ZOMBIE PANIC: SOURCE FTW!!!  :'DMy review on ""Sept 7, 2016 @ 12:30am""My thoughts may sound different a little bit now. But I'm editing this because I don't want to sound bias (or simple minded) for all those lovely people looking at the steam page in reviews right now, so let me tell you some of the crap most players will have to deal with on the game.First off, ddos. Someone thinking it's a good idea to stop servers for god knows what reason. Competition? Self-amusement? Like I know, I didn't get involved in the controversy. Either way, it just wasn't fun seeing. I don't notice it too much anymore though. It's pretty subtle as I'm writing this.Second, foreign players. I mean, I don't mind if they can only talk with the language they grew up with... but sometimes during your time on a server, out of no where someone joins and starts talking in spanish, russian, and even portuguese. It's funny (No, not in a good way) because sometimes no one else is talking to them back and yet they still try to talk like that through the entire time they're on the server. So tell me, what's the point with talking on the mic if NO ONE else is having a conversation with you? It could be intentional, but why do that to people to begin with anyway?Third, teamwork. Nope. And I mean NOPE. It's more ""I and my big gun"" than team. Because big guns is the solution for winning for most players. Drop your pistol and run to a bigger gun to hog it all for yourself (especially the armor). ""Someone is getting killed by whitey?"" ""Are they a walking gun I can use?"" ""No?"" ""Well, he can go die than."" ""Guns and camping are key!"" God, I swear. Why don't some people get that more zombies = bad? You're just adding more zombies to deal with and making things harder for yourself. Unless they... ragequit.Which brings me to my fourth complaint. I ABSOLUTELY hate it when someone plays, dies, then quits. Why? You too good to be a zombie? I mean, this IS a zombie game. It's expected and fair, right? Seriously, that's like playing hide 'n seek and when you're found, you just say ""I QUIT!"". ""You can't make me find those other guys like a well respected individual!"" ""I THOUGHT I WAS SUPPOSED TO WIN TO BEGIN WITH!"" ""Challenge is a hell no in my book!"" ""Have fun finding them by yourself!"" It's just very immature. Though despite all of these reasons -DESPITE them all... I always come back. Yes, I still recommend the game after these points because this game has the charm to make me want to return to enjoy the good fun stuff on it, being the only game that has the potential to do so for me... it really means a lot if I got past those points. I know I'm not the only one. There are still developers trying to make it better and even have updates. Who knows, maybe if you're 100% new and considering playing with the game, you can simply try it and see if you can understand what I mean.			"

												My review on ""Mar 12, 2013 @ 5:01pm""A ""free"" zombie game SO worth trying out! It's my first and favorite steam game and will always be! I love this game for the awesome players, simple but fun gameplay, and wonderful memories...with that I will always go back for more! ZOMBIE PANIC: SOURCE FTW!!!  :'DMy review on ""Sept 7, 2016 @ 12:30am""My thoughts may sound different a little bit now. But I'm editing this because I don't want to sound bias (or simple minded) for all those lovely people looking at the steam page in reviews right now, so let me tell you some of the crap most players will have to deal with on the game.First off, ddos. Someone thinking it's a good idea to stop servers for god knows what reason. Competition? Self-amusement? Like I know, I didn't get involved in the controversy. Either way, it just wasn't fun seeing. I don't notice it too much anymore though. It's pretty subtle as I'm writing this.Second, foreign players. I mean, I don't mind if they can only talk with the language they grew up with... but sometimes during your time on a server, out of no where someone joins and starts talking in spanish, russian, and even portuguese. It's funny (No, not in a good way) because sometimes no one else is talking to them back and yet they still try to talk like that through the entire time they're on the server. So tell me, what's the point with talking on the mic if NO ONE else is having a conversation with you? It could be intentional, but why do that to people to begin with anyway?Third, teamwork. Nope. And I mean NOPE. It's more ""I and my big gun"" than team. Because big guns is the solution for winning for most players. Drop your pistol and run to a bigger gun to hog it all for yourself (especially the armor). ""Someone is getting killed by whitey?"" ""Are they a walking gun I can use?"" ""No?"" ""Well, he can go die than."" ""Guns and camping are key!"" God, I swear. Why don't some people get that more zombies = bad? You're just adding more zombies to deal with and making things harder for yourself. Unless they... ragequit.Which brings me to my fourth complaint. I ABSOLUTELY hate it when someone plays, dies, then quits. Why? You too good to be a zombie? I mean, this IS a zombie game. It's expected and fair, right? Seriously, that's like playing hide 'n seek and when you're found, you just say ""I QUIT!"". ""You can't make me find those other guys like a well respected individual!"" ""I THOUGHT I WAS SUPPOSED TO WIN TO BEGIN WITH!"" ""Challenge is a hell no in my book!"" ""Have fun finding them by yourself!"" It's just very immature. Though despite all of these reasons -DESPITE them all... I always come back. Yes, I still recommend the game after these points because this game has the charm to make me want to return to enjoy the good fun stuff on it, being the only game that has the potential to do so for me... it really means a lot if I got past those points. I know I'm not the only one. There are still developers trying to make it better and even have updates. Who knows, maybe if you're 100% new and considering playing with the game, you can simply try it and see if you can understand what I mean.			"

This game is about barricading yourself in, conserving your ammunition, worrying about which weapons you are going to carry in your limited inventory and trying to survive against all odds with white knuckles and relying on nothing but skill, tactics and your team.

												Zombie Panic Source is a fun multiplayer zombie game where you're either a zombie or a Survivor and the zombies must kill all Survivors to win. It is one of the best FREE to play games out their in my opinion. However the graphics are not that great as this was made quite a while back but it is made up by it's gameplay, the game is really fun when playing with friends and the various maps and individual players mean that you can get an enjoyable experience every time you play.I would recomend everyone to atleast try the game out as it is a bunch of fun.

												If you're into a realistic zombie shoot 'em up, there is nothing better. I can honestly think of nothing as good as this. Obviously, not too popular with folks, who only care about their CoD, or L4D, this game really shines when you have your friends playing with you, and you have a good objective map with you. This game also has the advantage of an extremely experienced mod team, the amount of quality of this simple mod is just breathtaking.Pros-Realism, promotes teamwork-Balanced game, zombies actually can get kills, ammo and guns aren't just everywhere-Even a newbie can play zombie correctly, with a bit of logicCons-Realism puts some people off, means lack of community-Game induces considerable rage, not a stress reliever-Small amount of servers, especially Australian onesAll in all, I give this a 9/10			"

												If you like Zombie vs Human survival games and PVP co-op FPS games.  This is a PVP game.If you don't want to buy Left4Dead 1 or 2 or Killing Floor and have Half-Life 2 but want to play zombie vs human then this is the game for you.  If you own Half Life 2, get this mod game and play it.Loaded this game on 4 sept 2014, worked fine, found many active servers and some people showed up to play some.  Good looking map and avatars.  You have to find weapons and pick them up. Some maps have less weapons and ammo.  Zombie combat is little hard to get used to, melee only of course.  Humans can use guns and melee weapons.  If human dies, they turn to zombie side.  Zombies respawn.No tutorial, learn by doing and reviewing the keymapping, need some experience at playing PVP and FPS games.Uses server system like TF2 and HL2DM. You have to find a server with people playing or enter a server and hope someone shows up.   Some servers have modded maps that upset the balance of the game.  Some players might be hacking. For a free game, it works ok if you like this kind of game.			"

												Recent hype has begun again as the developers updated the game. Keep in mind this was not a large update mainly map fixes and rotation fixes. Never the less if more updates begin to be turned out there could be a chance that developer support has once again begun to pump into Zombie Panic: Source (Maybe because of the game Contagion going down the drain with no major updates since the summer of last year.) If Zombie Panic: Source is coming back into the light of development it will be amazing. That means there could be the chance of the game's community reviving and a new wave of players coming into the game to ensure the game doesn't die. I suggest checking out Zombie Panic Source if you enjoy teamwork, ammo management and only player controlled zombies.			"

												Really addictive game cant stop playing it. It is a race against time to complete goals on certain maps or to just survive. You have the choice at the start whether you want to be a zombie or human and you have to eliminate the other team. You are spawned into a random spot on the map (obviously in a house if you are human) and can either stay in the house and move objects and barricade so the zombies dont get you or you can go out and team up with people or just go solo. There are loads of different maps like the classic cabin outbreak or less popular ones such as the lake maps. There are also deathrun maps which are hillarious xD Overall, if you like zombies/survival games, like fast paced games and multiplayer games with variety then this game is for you!			"

												Avec Zombie Panic Source, on oublie un peu tout, on met sa cervelle de côté et on prie pour être du côté humain. ...Est ce que ça vaut le coup de passer 4 heures à télécharger ce petit mod ?Et bien pour se faire, je vais vous citer tous les bons côtés de ce mod, ainsi que ses défauts.Côtés positifs :1)On a le droit à un jeu accessible : il est gratuit (c'est ce qu'on attend pour un mod après tout). Le jeu est aussi accès casual, franchement, c'est plaisant et ça pose aucun soucis (exemple lambda :""You are dead ! [.5 minutes later.]You've spawn as a zombie !Kill them all ..."". Mais garre !Le jeu est, comme aujourd'hui 102% des jeux de zombies, très coopératif, autant du niveau des humains que des goules.Mais, ne nous égarons pas. Le jeu est avant tout très plaisant, et on n'en demande pas plus. De plus, on sait à quoi s'attendre avec ce jeu, ce qui est un élément à prendre.Côtés négatifs :2)Comme tous ces jeux gratuits, la communauté ne suit pas vraiment. En fait, le jeu est pollué par des pyjamas sans être à cours d'insultes russes. Et oui, pour nous, pauvres français, la majorité des gens sont russes. Si seulement. Des fois il vous arrivera d'entendre des battles très virils entre enfants. Passionant ... Plus sérieusement, créer une stratégie avec vos collégues demandera patiente et persévérance !C'est un peu le revers de la médaille...Mais, à ce que je sache, le jeu n'a pas beaucoup de problèmes comme de bugs.Il est temps de répondre à cette question : est- ce que ça vaut le coup de télécharger Zombie Panic Source ?Et bien oui ! Même si la communauté de ce jeu peut parfois décevoir, et qu'il est difficile d'établir une stratégie, le jeu vous procurera une bonne dose de fun pendant une petit heure, le temps de se mettre dans la peau d'un mort-vivant.Je vous recommande ce mod.

												That was cool... Give me back my 2007! I've found this game on local torrent-tracker and downloaded it, because i was interested in zombie-shooters. It was really old version (Don't remember, but there was only one models for survivor and zombies), a lot of bugs, de-syncs on servers, but it was great! What a memories! L4D2? Pff, give me a break, not too interesting and intense, you don't scaring to die. NMRIH? Yeah, thats cool! But i want to play as zombie! So, ZPS still the best :)Best regards to developement team!

												This game literally rekindled my love for shooters when it came out. My old friend introduced this and zombie master to me, and showed me how full conversion mods worked on source. The next day i went out and bought Half Life 2 and episode 1, and I haven't looked back since. Even now the game holds up well, and that's more than just sentimental talk. Tons of fun with friends, and even strangers, too.			"

												After being convinced by my boyfriend to play this game, I will say, after giving it a shot I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. With the very little hours I've put into the game, it was an exciting game overall. The survival and objective based maps are both a lot of fun and team oriented. If I had to choose between survival and objective based maps, I prefer the objective maps because it can be slightly repetitive with trying to hold out as long as possible when it comes down to you and another player, but not bareable at all. The objective maps are straight forward and you really got to stick together as a team to move forward with the map. The second your team's defense is broken, you definitely need to cover each other as much as possible or hall ♥♥♥ LOL. The game play is a lot of fun, it can get your adrenaline going, and the community is very well-rounded. I highly recommend this game to anyone who hasn't tried it out yet. You won't be disappointed.			"

												ZAMBO PANIC : THE FEATURE THAT NEVER GETS USED SO ITS KINDA REDUNDANT.Zambo panic! : dying simulator is a game about zombies. but unlike your classic fish of duty, there is a bunch of hings to manage. such as.WEAPON WEIGHT : Depending on how many or how heavy your weapons are, you will walk slowerSTAMINA : Self explanatory.BOOLETS : These add to the weight of your character, Hooray for being a slow fatass!Thats about it. The game has a key feature that is mostly overlooked, its the panic button. A.K.A ""♥♥♥♥ this, im out."" You drop anything you are holding and get a speed boost to survive the zambos another 5 seconds.Teamwork is essential in this game, take it like a L4D minus the generous weapon and ammo everywhere.Overall a very fun game. point scores are redundant and bad for the customer. make yer own desicions fool.

												A well-made source mod that offers a type of gameplay not experienced in other zombie games.The game is split up into two primary game modes: survival and objective maps. Objective maps give a group of players a linear set of objectives that take players along a map. The objectives in each map aren't all that repetitive and have you completing a variety of tasks that lead you to new parts of the map. This gametype is impossible to solo and some maps demand lots of communication. Survival mode scatters players throughout a map and has them survive either until all the zombies have been killed or the timer runs out. Since there is no map progression, players must hunker down, set up barricades and gather supplies in order to survive.ZPS was made with teamwork in mind. From my experience, the surivor win-rate in surival mode is about 20-30% and about 5-20% in objective maps. Once a survivor dies they become a zombie, so if you lose too many of your teammates too fast, you will have a harder time as the map progresses. Everything you carry (down to each bullet) has weight that noticably impacts your movement speed and available run energy. People that hoard supplies are not only easy prey for zombies, they are also easily noticable by teammates which will rightfully give you a hard time. Every gun also requires its cooresponding type of ammunition; if your friend runs out of ammo for his AK47, you can toss him a magazine of rifle ammo if you got any.Being a source engine game, ZPS enjoys new maps and content from the modding community. Although it's not what it was years ago, there's still plenty of maps that were created for you to enjoy now. Just don't expect many more new maps in the future unless you're willing to make them.Overall, I recommend this game to anyone after a more team-based, realistic zombie-survival experience.			"

												decent zombie game, seems to be based on the counter-strike zombie mod thats been on the scene since 1.6.  basically humans on one team, one becomes zombie and has to jump around and bite the other human players until one remains.  this game goes stale quick, even with the many custom maps, the game mode itself gets dull.

												As a game it functions well, even though the community from what I've gathered is a lot less than what is once was.The gameplay, when you get used to the control scheme, is very solid and most times you die as a survivor you feel either that it was your fault for not being careful enough or tricked because you thought your teamates had your back.As a Zombie you have a fair advantage in that you can take many bullets before dying and that you can run while the survivors can't (of some unexplained reason, technically the survivors jog) while you just outnumber or ambush players to defeat them as you can rarely face them headon alone.The maps aren't too big but it feels like there is almost always happening around you but when it doesn't the game is quite dull if you are a zombie and quite ""suspensful"" for lack of a better word when you are a survivor.It is fairly balanced even though at some maps the Zombies has a large advantage over the survivors and the other way is true on some maps.The graphics aren't the best but it certainly fits the tone better than more realistic graphics had and that is just another positive things in its advantage.The only major drawbacks is firstly, that most players is very skilled as the few remaining players is either veterans or new players with veterans being the most common, secondly, that while it is an engaging game it has a few bugs which might annoy you, finally, the movement system feels a bit too clumsly (I would excuse this if it were the movement itself and not the controls which made the characters feel a bit heavy) with the jump mechanism being the worst offender.But overall it is one of those nowadays almost fallen gems in gaming which deserve to be played:Which is why I would actually say it deserves a 7 out of 10.

												Definition of a fallen angel right here. This game use to be my bread and butter of gaming but over the years, the community was split because the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ decisions the developers made. Every yearly patch that they did tried to make the game play the way they wanted it to be played rather than how the community played the game. The game is nothing more than a walk down hallway to do objective A and backtrack to B to wait for C kind of game. I have nothing against those games but the fact that it didn't start that way rustled my jimmies. If you want a more skill based competitive zombie game, you're looking in the wrong area... The problem is that there is no other competitive game like it...-Here's a small edit;After 3 years (since this crappy review was wrote), I promised a friend that I would go back and play a few rounds just for old time sake. Well, my review holds the testament of time. That ""split community"" has basically evaporated to <50 players total with bots making up the majority. Jimmies are still rustled.			"

												I'm a hug fan of zombie games, not really sure why but that's just how it is. I find that this one is pretty stellar!My favorite part is being a human (just like everyone else), it's fun to hold off the zombie horde with your dwindling supplies with your friends or alone if you board yourself off in a room. It's entirely possible to play how you want as a survivor, although saftey in numbers is always very true to zombie games especially when the zombies are controlled by unpredictable players opposed to AI. Most people seem to dislike being a zombie in this game, typically claiming it to be boring or tedious or something like that. i find the experience to be enjoyable especially when you can outsmart your human counterparts! It is very satisfying to chew apart someone who thinks they are safe with a incrediable barricade in the stairway but left a window behind them totally exposed! To be a zombie all you need to do is be a little smarter.I totally recommend this game to anyone interested in the genre, to play it i just downloaded Source SDK Base 2007 since i don't have any of the supporting games.

												I knew about mods predating this one with a similar premise back when they first debuted, which interested me and eventually I learned of this one. Sorry but nope. Metas just as bad as gmod's zombie survival, all my experiences playing with randoms (cannot speak for playing with friends) consisted of the following: spawning as a zombie because survivors are always full, spending 4-5 minutes straight whacking at a single board on a door to break it down either getting shot during this act or someone placing another board on the entry point. Two, finally getting inside the location the survivors had so heavily defended to find no trace of them and everything empty, wander around the map only to find them either in a glitched area zombies can't get to, or have done something to create one of said areas and abuse this meta. The entire rest of the round consists of them sitting up there with seemingly endless ammo picking off zombies as they spawn, endlessly.I'll pass, I'd recommend no more room in hell instead.			"

												Vincent Price's most helpful reviews:Zombie Panic Source: is a game I had quite a fun time with in past years, when the communities of milk cows were booming and bustling full of people whose player name's were too long. Indeed, the gameplay is action packed, exciting, and you can kill zombies efficiently with whatever play style you should choose, run and gun, melee, defend a barricade, and so on.Of course the manliest method is to just fight them all with a melee weapon, like the Sledgehammer. Why, I remember the good old days when a friend of mine (Who also happened to be quite a melee specialist) and I took on an entire team of enemy zombies with just two Sledgehammers and some armor. There were about 20 zombie lives we had to extinguish before killing the 10 or so of them and it was quite exhilarating for an online FPS experience.I would certainly recommend this game to people who can time travel and experience how it was when people actually played it, 10/10 for time travelers, 5/10 currently. Can not recommend.			"

												I got exhausted on it, but I still think it's a very good mod. ZP:S is a more relaxing and fun-like approach on the numerous available zombie apocalypse multiplayer games. Compared to other FPS it's pacing is a bit slower; sometimes things get a bit messy, but often that leads to humorous situations. Generally you can get quite many laughs out of it.It's PvP only, humans control the survivors and zombies. You choose your team before a round starts. Should no player/not enough players (there is a ratio and autoteam balance) join either team some are assigned randomly. Ammo is relatively scarce, but respawns on the maps after a while, which eventually enables more skilled humans to survive for prolonged times. Luckily there is fatigue, so they cannot run forever. There are several melee weapons, which allow ammo conservation, but it's very risky since (depending on the server settings) either the ""carrier"" or regular zombies have a chance of infecting you on hit. The first player to join the zombie team becomes the ""carrier"" - he has more health, can infect people by default and can activate a ""roar"" which makes him glow throw walls for his teammates so they can see his location and group up on him as a kind of leader. If supported/respected by the map designers zombies also spawn near the carrier when his roar is active, practically turning him into a mobile spawn point. Sadly a great mass of custom maps (many servers are running with them) are not supporting this feature properly. Infected people appear in green color to the zombies. To human teammates it is hidden. Infected cannot drop or pick up items any longer. There are HUD indicators telling you about your infection. Seconds before turning friendly fire is enabled for the infected, which is why - just in case - some survivors always walk around taking melee swings at teammates that took damage from the zombies. On some servers there are pills that can cure infection, though I believe this is not a default setting of this game. In most modes when you die as a survivor you are switching over to the zombie team, that is why you want to keep your infection hidden to your (as of now still) allied survivor mates, just to wait behind them and get some of them when you are turning.You can extensively barricade yourself in this game. You can put up wooden planks in two different sizes freely on flat surfaces. And you can push around furniture items thanks to the Source engine. This allows for some pretty nasty and interesting fortification jobs. For example you put up two planks across a door and then push couches in front of the planks. Or you do it the other way around. Whatever works best, really. Provided the survivors do the barricading well enough, and keep the zombies long enough at distance, this can be decisive to either win or lose a round. Zombies can push things with the right mouse button back though, combined with ""sprinting"" (lunging) they do a ""super push"" tossing furniture across whole rooms and killing some humans with the power of physics, eventually. Pretty hilarious when you manage to pull off such spectacular kills. There are four modes:Survival: Zombies have a shared pool of limited lives. If all zombies die or if a certain time has passed without the zombies having killed all humans the survivors win.Objective: Zombies have unlimited lives. Humans traverse the maps, handle objects, overcome obstacles and get extracted in some way.Hardcore: Zombies spawn directly behind the humans (""Escape""/""Deathrun""/""Traps"" maps). The humans must flee from them and survive for some time. The zombies have additional numbers of ""carriers"" and take more damage.ZPA: Zombies and humans have unlimited lives (in the other modes once a human dies he is assigned to the zombie team, in ZPA he respawns as a human again). There are control points appearing in random spots of the map, both teams are fighting for them, these points generate score points and spawn supplies should survivors capture them. The team with most score points wins, or the zombies do when they manage to capture the central point of the humans.Teamplay is advised to properly and quickly barricade defensive areas and organize guns and ammo, just as zombies need to organize somewhat since their team plays by the rule ""Strength in numbers"". Zombies attacking survivors alone are easy pickings, while a horde can absorb more bullets and eventually find a moment to slip through and take some human down. Sadly to me the community looks a bit degenerated. There are always servers and people playing, but not extraordinary many, at some point you run into the same folks over and over again, and numerous play in sort of an elitist way ignoring common sense, the well-being of their teammates and the goals of the often objective-based game modes, doing everything but not what they are supposed to. Eventually they will actively grief and help the other team by - for example - hording ammo without using it or destroying your barricades without having any reason to. Or people who die as survivors and are switched to the zombie team simply go afk because they don't like playing as zombies. To add to it I haven't come across too many properly administrated servers - often there aren't any admins, they don't care or they abuse their power.The game is updated sometimes, but it doesn't like look as if there is much more to be added. That may change because the developers seem to be working both at updating ZP:S and on a new title called ""Contagion"". ZP:S is pretty fine as it is and there is a lot of custom content. Most problems I see with it emerge from the players, not from the game itself.			"

												1987Somewhere in IndonesiaDeep within the rotting heart of a long forgotten jungle, amidst the gnarled limbs of ancient trees and among unholy abominations of nature only heard of in the myths whispered in frightened tones between superstitious men, found beneath the endless shadow of a dense canopy is a crevice. A savage wound upon the earth that emanates such forbodement only a man either very brave or completely foolish would even consider venturing into such an ominous place. Within this crevice there lives a sole being, one who had forsaken his humanity centuries ago in his blind pursuit of power. His mind and body, which are as now ravaged by the annals of time as the primordial hellscape in which he makes his home, are driven by a singular, ardent goal; to give life to a being comprised solely of sickness and decay, pestience given form. It is today that he has reached the end of his thankless undertaking, and as he gives himself over to oblivion to reap his eternal reward, a new being most foul is ushered into this world. It breathes in its first intake of the heavy air that's been trapped within the confines of the savage gash in the earth where it's father had made his home for the past 17 aeons, and it absconds from this dark and humid place, leaving it's womb to become a parasite upon all of mankind. A malicious incubus, it spreads itself across the world like a silent veil, preying only on the lowest dregs of society's unwanted filth so as to avoid drawing attention to it's wicked deed, filling the heads of the impoverished, the desperate, the lonely with petty things and treats of carnal vanity while foisting itself upon their emotions until they're spent physically and mentally, leaving them as fetid, putrid husks that only resemble human beings. It's power wanes and ebbs, but never does it fade out completely, and never does it dare draw in more than it needs. Be wary, to call underestimating the toll this beast will have on your soul naive is an understatement that can not be overstressed. Also the games kinda ♥♥♥♥ now so I'd go buy like Overwatch or whatever they're calling the homogenized dogshit kids are funneling into their mouths these days, you'll be better compensated for garbage incarnate kickin you in your shrivelled taint.7/10 game could use more salt			"

PROPS! yes you can push them. zombies can push them out of their way.now zombieszombies are op. they arent like l4d2 where they die in one shot. they will take more bullets but more damage to the head.now go out there and survive!i rate this a 10/10 needs more keyboards			"

												Once upon a time, you got locked up in a random house, then a random zombie comes in, then you randomly panic and grab a random super shotty, and then you randomly shotty the random zombie into random obvilion.  Then you think you won the random battle, but just then 20 more random zombies appear out of random places and surround you.  You try to random shotty them but you randomly find out you have to reload after 2 random shots.  Just then a zombie randomly comes in and melee you. You find yourself randomly dead in a randomly house, then you suddenly turn into a random zombie for random reasons that cannot be explained randomly.The end.  That was random.			"

												This game is a little slow paced compared to Call of Duty and other FPS's, but this game is by far the best military simulator with extremely large maps and a huge variety of vehicles and weapons to choose from. Singleplayer is not so great but all of the fun and action comes from the co-op missions online. You won't get anywhere in this game without an organized team which is one of the many reasons why this game is so fun. Highly recommended. Blows any competition out of the water (Op Flashpoint: Dragon Rising, CoD, MoH, etc.).			"

The feeling that the ""Carrier"" (The starting zombie that can infect you in a few or 1 hit) is (INSERT SPY) Right behind you. 2. The more you carry, the slower you go. And 3. The sad music that can sometimes play, it makes me sad that you see someone die like that. .-. But still this game is great.			"

												A rarely seen take on ""survival horror"", where every shot counts, healing is rare and far-inbetween, and every weapon is golden, nothing must go to waste lest you'll die a horrible death at the hands of an unrelenting zombie horde. Given that it's 100% free to play (it being a HL2 mod) and with fantastically team-based gameplay mechanics, it's bound to give you a more ""serious"" look on how you should deal with the undead. 9/10			"

												This game is fun and fast pace, and though the hitting machanic is not up to snuff, along with the fact that the zombies can take more damage then you counter balance the expierience. Though it is neat that you have to get the objectives in the right order, I'd give this game a 8.5/10(Playable).			"

												Zombie Panic! Source is a co-op oriented Survivor vs Zombie multi-player survival horror mod.In the mod, players can generally participate in timed matches against the opposite team, or the humans try to solve objective-based missions. One thing that really separates Zombie Panic! from Left 4 Dead is that if you die, you will become a zombie. To prevent yourself from going the way of the undead, you will have to arm yourself with shotguns, rifles, explosives and more. In addition to a lot of last man (or zombie) type matches, as previously mentioned, there are also objective-based scenarios. In these modes, humans will often have to find resources like wood boards or gas canisters, turn cranks and knobs, or do a combination of both. Zombie Panic! Source is an overall good-looking mod with some minor clipping issues.So if you are looking for another interesting take on the oncoming zombie apocalypse, Zombie Panic! Source is not a bad choice.Sounds 7/10Graphics 7/10Gameplay 8/10Atmosphere 8/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												I played this game long before it got put on steam, back when you had to get it from the mods website or on something like moddb or filefront. When it came out on steam, everything was gone. When I joined a server, it was obvious it was filled with a bunch of new players. I became the alpha zombie and walked directly in the line of sight of human players and I didn't even get shot. I uninstalled it and went back to the previous version that still had all the amazing maps and servers, too bad everyone who did play moved up while the maps stayed on the previous version. Now many years later, I wonder if all those great maps are on this one.			"

												In my earlier years I would've recommend this game but now?Its a total snore, everyone plays that one map ""Cabin"" barricades up with alll the guns and ammo they can find and its basically open season on every zombie that even gets near said barricdes.BUT BUT XENO! There have been improvements to the game to balance it out for both zombies and survivors!That, Is really subjective however really the maps namely most of the custom ones are strictly ""Survive for X amount of minutes"" with a few actual objective ones and some fun little jumping puzzle maps too where the zombies are the ones pressing the buttons for the traps.Anyways, I do not recommend this Source mod IF you do want a decent zombie experience now a days go to NiMH its also free and you don't need another source game to run it.(However this game like THAT one does require you to have friends, otherwise it is a real snore fest)			"

I was left sitting in a corner contemplating the game as a zombie, and decided to unistall it. Left 4 Dead or the Killking Floor series is worlds better than this, also no controler support, local play, bots or etc. People's standards must be really low if they dig this.			"

												I would say get left 4 dead if you just want to be the survivor and not have to be the zombie. In this game you have to be the zombie after you die. Their is no campaign and if you want to play with your friend(s) one of you has to be the zombie and one has to be the survivor. If they put in a mode where the zombies were controlled by the cpu that would be great but this is a no for me.			"

												Decent fun, providing you avoid the hilariously badly made custom maps and stick to either the official ones or certain high-quality others (Shreddingfield, Corpseton, Murksville etc.). Although it hasn't aged so well in some areas and is victim to a mostly terrible community filled with micspamming children, it's saving grace is the often very tense strategic hunting-gathering gameplay you'll need to employ if you want to survive.

												On the first day I played on cabin_outbreak and church maps, where you have to defend for 10 minutes. I was addicted to it for the day, as it had interesting things like building barricades, placing blanks of wood over walls. And you could use Source engine for the great good (and the great evil for zombies) to barricade the stairs and doors with actual prop using dem physics.Then I realized that it sucked, just like Zombie Horde for Doom Skulltag. Zombies just walk around, tanking everything, while humans camp on high ground and shoot everything or run around in open ground and hunt zombies, who are just too slow for that. Tons of weapons and ammo, hilarity ensues. You win as zombies only because some humans aren't good enough or get too bored.Didn't take long time to realize that these maps are like cp_orange in TF2. Something awful that attracts lots of people for weird reasons.Thankfully, there was server running stock and custom objective-based maps as well, so I was addicted for another day. All yay humans not being able to just camp and having to move and share ammunition.Then I still realized that it didn't fall too far from Zombie Horde either. Zombies can ambush, but they still have to tank and dance around while being shot. They still can win if there is too many.  While humans fight cheapness with cheapness by having revolver than one-shots them all into head. As usual with PvP zombie games with no AI zombies, it starts with humans easily doing everything and most likely win unless they make some mistake and it all steamrolls down the hill, usually.And don't know, maybe I am too spoiled by Zombie Horde taking over Doom Skulltag, but this one felt uninspired and kinda samey.

												This isn't left for dead, or killing floor. Or any of AI controlled zombie shoot em up games. Players take the role as zombies, and other players take the role of survivors. It takes the gameplay of counter strike, think of counter terrorists and terrorists. Each map has randomly selected weapons for you to find, a large variety of weapons to be exact. You must have a game that runs a source engine though. (CS:S, Tf2, HL2, as so on.)			"

												It takes a lot to make a good zombie gameHaving player controlled zombies isn't the way forwardLeft 4 Dead gave you special infected; zombies that could pack a punch if the player behind it had some skill. But in this, the undead are slow with the stupidest sprint mechanic imaginable. So joining a game late and being forced onto the zombie team just isn't fun.Playing the survivors is just pitiful.Melee weapons seem to have no punch behind them, and the same can be said for firearms. I get absolutely no feedback on whether the shot hit or missed because the undead don't flinch almost at all. The ammo drop system is probably the most complex and easily forgettable I have encountered in my gaming life.Maps, especially survival maps, are pain-stakingly repeatetive. Survivors always hold up in the same space. I feel utterly dumbstruck when I'm in a garage with one easily defended entrance and two garage doors for quick escapes, ammunition and weapons littering the floor and anyone else who spawned with me storms off to the meta position as if miffed by how the spawn system dared not spawn them inside the ♥♥♥♥ing top floor of that house (Yes, cabin, you overused ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I'm looking at you).Now, I'm not going to complain too much about the graphics, considering their age and how I sort of like these kinds of graphics. What I am going to complain about is how bored I got while playing it. As a survivor, I'm waiting in the meta spot (Because standing anywhere else is essentially suicide) waiting for a zombie to come clear into view without the possibilty of missing with the pistol everyone gets, before it is immediatley shot by some other guy who has three firearms strapped to his back. Once the undead storm us, we all die and those who run tire eventually and are caught by the infected. As a zombie I spend half the time knocking down the door before A: The objective changes and their's a brand new door I can keep bashing my head against until it breaks out of pity or B: I open it and am turned into a collander. I run out of sprint easily as I try to get to the survivors before they move on, and can't catch up to them because they used that ♥♥♥♥ing panic move.I understand that this game is an 8 year-old community mod and making zomies human controlled may have been a good way of not writing the seven-thousand lines of programming for a single step of an AI controlled one, and it gives dead players something to do other than twiddling their thumbs, but it's very hard to do without causing a complete imbalance.

												So, I jumped back into ZPS after roughly two-and-a-half years of owning the game without playing it. Along with one of my friends, I joined a custom server running a custom map, but no other mods. Within five minutes, two other people had joined, making a total of four on the server - not ideal, since we were planning on inviting one of our other friends for a three player match, but we had no ways of creating a private server at the time, and ""what could possibly go wrong?"".One of these people was friendly, complimenting us after each kill and/or match, whereas the other was a racist ten-year-old that I presume was Russian (he could speak English, but not very well). He barricaded himself inside a house using indestructable objects, wedged himself INSIDE said objects to prevent us from entering, and proceeded to taunt us, calling us many things that I frankly would not want to hear when playing a game for a night of fun. We only managed to win due to the infectious properties of the Alpha Zombie (whom I was playing at the time) combined with a lucky hit, at which point he proceeded to shout/talk loudly over the mic (I had the in-game mic off already, but my friend had to turn it off in order to continue playing without being distracted).I know that this doesn't sum up the whole community, but this experience put me off the game for at least two-and-a-half more years. Thanks, kid, I appreciate it.			"

												If there would be put in a little more effort and some fixes like indestructable items trough other allies I think this game would be really great. But since more players decrease the fun because they destroy youre blockades it is useless to play. Also it is not possible to download other maps then the original maps. Even though all settings are right in Steam and the game it will not work. The game is going to be 8 years old. I played it since the beginning while it was great. Now it is just .. nah. Put more effort in the development and see better results.Minecraft is the best example what people can create out of pure crap.So long the nairA.			"

												Meh. Game is uber buggy.Pros: It's pretty interesting to play a game where you can take either the human or zombie side. I haven't found an alternative to this game yet, but it can be fun if you find the right server to play on. The game is pretty intense if you can get it working.Cons: The game lacks support. The developers did their best with what they had. Without anyone really playing it, there is hardly any servers to play on. This is due to the many problems with bugs. If you have over 200 ping, you can forget even playing this game. The maps the game has to offer suck for the most part.There is fun to be found in the game. But seeing how someone is going to do a better job somewhere else. You are better off playing other Zombie Survival games. Which they are starting to pop up now (DayZ)			"

So, when I got it, I realised my friends had it as well so I could play with them. Basically the game is a human/zombie deathmatch. And if you don't like that, it gets worse. If you're new to the game, you probably get put in the zombie's team. And the game is full of complete sweats, which are probably on the human's team. And when you're on the human's team, you're freaking unstoppable. But if you do get killed as a human, you would probably turn over to the zombie's side, so you would be killed and killed and killed. This game is really bad and I advise you not to get it, even though it's free.			"

Doest it sound easy? No chance the zombies are pretty much the definition of tough so even 1vs1 can not end good for you, so get ready, meet somepeople befriend them, stick close and for gosh sake keep your eyes peeled around you and kick ♥♥♥, lastly the creatures of the dark will show no mercy, will you?

												The only thing to criticize in this game is low player count and managing ammunition while playing as a survivor. It's like counterstrike zombies but you don't get screwed by OP zombies with 999 health if you don't choose the exact right place where you can glitch yourself out of the enemy team's undead reach, at which point it sucks to be a zombie and you might as well just camp in a corner. Such is not the case in Zombie Panic Source. It isn't quite left 4 dead 2, but it's definitely not a bad game. It's way better than counterstrike zombies.			"

												Great free to play source mod.Although the hit detection and life bar is ridiculous for player and zombie its still a enjoyable game that brings fun at every corner. If your into infection games this game should be one of the first on that list. Maps are very well designed and the community are a funny bunch. I'd give a 7/10 for this mod.			"

												the game,itsel is great,storys not so much i do indeed like the game and gives you a chill that just runs down your back,it is free so you cant expect much the graphics are not to bad though but it will take some time to get the shooting down it is awsome and there is only one thing i hate about the game and its the reason i havent played it in like the year i new it was out....its name ZOMBIE PANIC!SOURCE is indeed the dumbest name they could have found and i guess if you were like me i should remind you dont judge a book by its cover and also you really dont need the games it say you need all you have to do is hit the no option and it will take 16/300 of a gb wich is nothing so i do enjoy the little time i played on it and do indeed intend to play more in the future i hop i heped.................... :)			"
