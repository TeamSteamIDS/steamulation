												Are you seeing this because you are intrested to buy it on a sale? Don't even read further and get it right away for these few $ it is worth. Still curious? Let me explain why my hours for this game are so high.This game has a very active modding scene who created a variety of different gamemodes. Unlike the name deathmatch tells you there is plenty of other things to do making it fun for everybody. The community is great and in many places very helpfull. They will sort out bugs you have or simply teach you how to play the game. You should definately buy this game! Expand the review to learn about its gamemodes.(Team) DeathmatchServers : CommonSub Types : 1v1 , Matches , Bots , Variety of gravity's , KillBoxAs the name of the game indicates this is the original gamemode of the game. There are many different kinds of maps. Killbox is mainly a box where you can hit about everyone with some stuff for you to mess with. Other maps can involve a variety of sceneries (Mappers like to use there own themes instead of just City 17). There is still an active competitive scene so if your up for 1v1 matches dig around and you can surely find them. Some servers often killbox like to turn the gravity down for some low gravity fun.The gunplay is what i call ""Unbalanced"". This means that some guns are clearly superior over other guns and you will have to focus on getting better weapons from the moment you spawn (Quake style but not as extreme). If this is not your thing just continue reading because there are plenty of modes for you to find.The most populair frag video from a well known clan :

 Cooperative Servers : CommonSub Types : Exclusive maps to some servers, Multiple gravities, Exclusive Weapons to some servers, Dual CoopThis is my personal favorite mode. Infact i like this mode so much i built an entire server[www.bouncyball.eu] around it.In cooperative maps you work together with your team to destroy the aliens of the singleplayer game (Combines are broken). Additionaly some of the maps give you challenges similair to the physics puzzles in the original game or allow 2 teams to mix cooperative with the deathmatching (Both examples are rare as most maps are normal cooperative).Here is some uncut gameplay from my server to give an incidation of what the gamemode is like :

 Puzzle Servers : CommonThe name says it all. You are put in a map where you have to complete a set of puzzles in order to beat the map.The puzzles you get a very varied and can involve anything from finding a path in a minefield , driving airboats along a track , building your way to the exit or hitting targets with a specified gun. Puzzle map creators are very creative in the challenges they think up so each map will have its own unique challenges to beat.Puzzle map gameplay :

			We were reminiscing over the good old days of HL2DM puzzle maps when we thought we'd download one and give it a try. It was as fun as we remembered.		

 Roleplay Servers : CommonRoleplay is another fan favorite for many people of the game. It is cops and robbers style gameplay where you buy and sell your items and on alot of servers you can even buy and decorate your own house. Personally i did not play it much so my review would probabbly fall short of the possibility's in these servers.Probabbly not the best vid : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o54-ZKvVP8A Surf Servers : RareSub Types : With or without weapons (With is more common)Surf is something adopted from the counterstrike community. It all involves trying to surf down a track of slidey walls and not falling of the sides. On most maps depending on where you failed you get placed in a deathmatch box with a better weapon then those who failed before you.Surf Gameplay : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuexNobUAS0 Trick Jumping Servers : Medium RareThese maps are similair to Surf in the way that you are trying to get from A to B. They mostly do not involve gunplay of any kind. Instead of sliding along walls you have to beat jumps of increasing difficulty. While fun on its own this is also often used to train for better movement in the deathmatches.Hard Trickjump Gameplay : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEeuAHpI9l8 Zombiemod Servers : RareSub Types : Hybrd with zombie survival , Straight up killingWhile there are zombiemod servers they are not always around as these servers run different modes and the type of zombiemod also depends strongly on the server you play it on. Other servers usually have a bigger deathmatch focus and no npc's but since i only play it on mine i will tell you how it goes on our server.The round starts with everyone as a survivor where you fight unlimited npc zombies in a set time. Once someone fails and greats beaten he will join the other team and only have a crowbar. Zombies are slower then survivors by default but are the only team that can use the spint ability. Survivors win by surviving long enough while zombies win by making sure all humans are dead.In case you want to play it and no other servers are running zombiemod you can join our server bouncyball[bouncyball.eu] and vote for one of the zombiemod maps using !jb. Deathrun Servers : RareIn deathrun one team tries to run from A to B and the other sets off traps to stop them. There are a vareity of maps all with there own set of traps.Gameplay from the most populair deathrun server : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYEpKmfEAz8 Scripting / Cheating / Building Servers : RareSub Types : Cheating , Building using server commands onlyWait what? Cheating? Hacking? o.OWhy would anyone want to do this?The answer is simple. Using cheats and ""Hacks"" very cool stuff can be done in the engine. Do not expect these servers to be overrun with aimbotters (although some people will kill your godmode protection off). This is all about creating great things with the cheats in the game or your own custom addons.Sadly all good videos of this have been removed but a quick summery of some stuff i saw : Giant Mechs (Working) , Space invaders remade , Dokuman attack , gm_flatgrass turned into a forest , Gigantic volcano jump challenge that will explode in a cool manner when beaten.The possiblity's are HUGE! Conclusion I probabbly missed alot of gamemodes as these are server experiments. Think about FreezeTag or extremely modified servers.The server in this video has been remade entirely and most of the things shown are no longer there but it is a good indication of how crazy the game can get : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCmgRmg92Yo.It is also worth mentioning that as you can see in the above vid servers have a lot of control over the gameplay as they can program new features themselfs using the addon support for the game. Think about things such as statistics , jetpacks ropes and hooks , teleports , midget mode and many more.I hope my insiders view gave you a good insight in why this game is so well loved as the steam store page simply does not cut its job. The game has its drawbacks that in the past it has been ruined by valve quite a bit (And then fixed by valve and the community for the most part). Because valve does not look at this game very often the description and screenshots on the storepage are simply acient and you can experience some bugs and crashes. The more populair servers will do anything they can to provide a sollid gameplay experience so no worries.			"

												This game is a hidden gem among the deep heart of steam's heart.Half Life 2 Deathmatch throws all the HL2 weapons and throws you in an amazing selection of maps to fight in.This game is the lovely old deathmatch styled games. You either kill, or be killed! No hiding like games nowdays. You are the man, the badass, the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Skill is everything, not some weapon you need to buy for 5 dollars.Half Life 2 Deathmatch takes the badassness to the next level. You get to throw toilet bowls at each other with the gravity gun and get to time frags like a boss.Sadly, the fans of deathmatches aren't as popular as the past. So recommend this piece of badassery to your friends.10/10 Can shoot toilet bowls			"

												Main attaction here is the gravity gun. Pick up whatever you please, and throw it at the enemy.I just hope you don't buy the title for itself. Get it in a pack, so things are a little understable. Servers aren't common, as a few hours of thowing things around is good enough.I don't really feel like giving this title a rating, as it should be purchased in a pack with HL2...7/10 - Solid game for being a ""chuck that object at that"" simulator.

												This game will show your dark sides, how cheap you are, how cruel you are. When you enter this game there's no way back. You will backstab with a stunstick your own brother for a frag. Most of people like rats here: they shoot you with RPG in the back, they will throw SLAM grenades around you while you're AFK and when you die they will desecrate your dead body. But you will enjoy that all, because gameplay is fine.			"

												Since you're reading this review ill tell you a quick summary about the game and what it has brought to me.[STORY]I first started playing this game back in 2010 first game I ever bought I didnt think it would take all my time, but WOW is this game still much fun packed! When i first joined and played there weremany and many fun servers to join some deathmatch, puzzles,coop, and TDM. I met the majority of my steam friends here... and enemies. The noob i was helplessly getting killed over and over wanted me to just leave the game but something inside of me some power hiddentold me not to quit and keep playing and boy was it right![Quick Game Summary as of 2016 Feb 5th]As of now this game still has plenty of servers to join and are still much fun to play make sure you filter in the settings to Users playing in servers to have a better chance of finding Actual People in servers playing. The community of this game is very small now but everyone is nice, and helpful if you stick around long enough you will get to meet everyone , and become a regular  and make new friends. The type of game modes which are still around are Team-Deathmatch, Co-op, Puzzles,Deathrun, and Role-Play. HL2:DM still has much potential in it but the Developers just left it in the dust luckily we have very talented modders in the community who still make Beautiful maps, and amazing Pluggins for your enjoynment. For the Price of $5 this is a get right away game and play! You will need all Skills for this bad boy game no hacks,  practice on servers with bots and you will improve much more speed and accuracy for Deathmatch . Just like the good there is always the BAD you have to be careful when you play on specific servers, you will have the players and the Admins who will kick and ban for being better than them at the game. The game can be very fast paced or very slow paced for you campers depending which servers you joinsome have the fast kill one shot and others have the stock settings which take a few bullets more to kill. I honestly would say i put a lot of hours into this game,  and heck? i dont think i will ever be done playing this so I urge you to buy this game and try it out for yourself It is truly a ""Classic Jewl of a FPS game.""

Imagine Valve had a boy genius. He had excellent results, got his PHD and for a time was its favourite son.Now this guy works in a corporation, and he is barely remebered for his genius by his coleagues. Valve, tell your son you love him, give him a big hug and don't let him waste his talent - he deserves a better job!This game is AWESOME, it's fast paced (try to play COD and then go back to HL2DM and you'll see what I'm talking about).Also the ONLY game that lets you kill your friends with a heating radiator! 10/10See what I'm talking about:

												Great game, definitely one of the better games of my childhood and still the best around. Has Fps action + the ability to ""sprint"" with the games physics allows it to be a fast-er point and click shooter if not the fastest and the props/objects effecting it even more make it unique requiring good senses, reflex, smart reactions, coordination with just about everything to play at a decent potential. Where else can you Yoyo a grenade to keep it from 'cooking' it's fuse out before propelling it on it's last fuse reset that you can time for distance and height in coordination with how fast you are moving and your target's speed and the force of the 'gravity gun' you use to propel it with, no where else but hl2dm. Has different kinds of unique weapons like the gravity gun propelling a object to a person to kill them with, or propelling that object against another object to move that away from a distance. And to block a path with many objects or stack objects to reach a platform. Also the crossbow is an example of unique weapons with how it fires in a arch and hard to aim with even with it's scope but can kill a player instantly and with correct positioning can bounce of the floor walls ceiling terrian etc. and with enough practice can be well aimed to kill a player half the map away behind 2 corridors and a room. That is a taste of the Uniqueness of this game, after overlooking it's default multiplayer team vs team worth, there is it's booming in vast unique options to how to play the game with it's community's modded creations, there is co-op themed maps where you can fight with teammates against hordes of aliens, zombies, monsters and cyborgs getting points with the ability to use them to unlock server abilities to costumize your character with a deferent apearence, both in model skin and size, lights that glow on your model, lights that follow your model and more, then there is puzzle maps where you may enter 1 of 12 parts of the map at a time with your team or individualy and complete tasks like finding the exit in a labyrinth or placing and freezing a pile of crates to build a terrian leading to a exit floating high above in the sky or surfing on long slides without falling into abyss to reach a exit or jumping over ditches, climbing and avoiding obstacles in a temple like area to reach another exit to collect all exits and unlock the last portion of the map to complete it. Then there is Roleplay... a blend of multiplayer fps combat with gta style like the need to Purchase weapons or health or armor. Earning money by the minute with the wage given by your level or killing others for their pocket money, then saving that money to invest in a faster method of earning money like growing drugs to sell or printing money both to us on getting more guns or to purchase a home to hide in and to keep your drugs or printer safe, from other players or other players playing as Cops... who may not only steal your illegal possessions but will also place you in jail for some time so that they too may earn the points they need to progress faster and easier in that server. You may also invest in a home to hide from all players and keep your possessions safe, and to meet with your group of friends to prepare for a war against another gang, or to meet with your gang to prepare for a war against the police in alliance with other gangs for fun or for an event to earn more $. Also events are constant and include situations where a monster is spawned in the map similar to the any/many of the ones found in co-op maps that drop money on death. Another situation would be looking all over the map to find an object or player hiden with more $ $ $ that is given to the winner that finds it first. Or when admins just decide the server is full enough for a mass money drop in the middle of the map including weapons and item drops. There are also many more mods but I just thought to name a few of the ones that have me so adicted to this game. This game is worth the very low ticket price for all the fun is has to offer and is very much Alive, if not so is still rich with creativity you never know what's next. I rate it 5 out of 5 stars * * * * *.			"

												I like this game. It's pretty fun, and you get it when you purchase EP1 so you can have a multiplayer experience.I don't get everyone calling this game empty; It feels somewhat empty, but theres about 20 servers to play on with real people and almost no bots. I wouldn't call it empty, I say it has one foot in the grave. The community is in great shape for 2015, just like CS 1.6. There's still people playing, and there's also a lot of English people.Also, this game is hard to master. People can kill you with radiators, tooth brushes, rubber ducks (yes) and other objects you can pick up with the gravity gun. Once you get it, you'll have lots of fun. Also, DO NOT BUY IT HERE. Go buy HL2 EP1. It comes with EP1, Deathmatch and Deathmatch Source. You'll truly get a bang for your buck. "

												After 10 years still a good game with nice physics engine. Slowly the community is almost dead, but some good players and servers you can still find. At deathmatch its better than CounterStrike, at teamdeathmatch not as its not so high tactical game. Maps are also many nice ones around made by the community. Some servers use funny mods or settings. The community itself could be a bit more friendly, as some players flaming around a lot. But in other games its mostly the same. About gameplay... it takes a while till you get involved with some tricks and the physcannon, but after a while you won`t miss that game. Cheaters are also some around, but not as much as in CounterStrike. Try to learn nade-throwing with physcannon and good jump techniques beside your aim, than you have a lot of fun. check out hl2dm.net, tsgk.com, half-life-gaming.net, bloodsuckers.de.			"

												Multi-player arena, based on the Half-life 2 backgrounds, skins and weaponry. It used to be fun - right after the HL2 hit the shelves - but now, it's all quite boring, unless you have some tradition to meet up and make fun with friends there.The community is vanishing - the most of all servers are empty 4life. And even while there are still some people playing, if you haven't got there until now - then you can easily forget about this issue forever.What's good about HL2 Deathmatch - is all about physics and gravy-gun, and the ability to flood the server with multiple Freemans running around. Or cooperative maps, where you fight through some location filled with respawning monesters, hoping on the backup from the rest of your team.And now comes the bad part. For one, there are no (absolute zero) chances to find yourself a good team. There are no skilled players, as there are no application for their skills. The weaponry, that were so good in the single-player, aren't really any good for multiplayer arena FPS. That means totally random gameplay. You can die every second, or dominate with dozens of kills - it's not matter anything.So no, if you're not having some friends who will play with you there, I don't recommend to starting this one. Other Valve products, like Counter Strike and Team Fortress, are much more capable to entertain, and provide decent gameplay.Mark 5/10. Engine's good, the game at this point - not.			"

												Valve has a history of making famous Deathmatch games, and thats beacuse they don't bother over complicating the concept of Deathmatch. Tihs game along with Day of Deafeat Source and Counter Strike Source are simple and yet have raked in players by the thousands upon millions. It's a simple Deathmatch experience but it's not anything new. 2 Teams pitted againnst each other with your usuall Team Deathmatch action, nothin to complicated but it is still fun.			"

												Half-Life 2 Deathmatch is the official multiplayer component to Half-Life 2. It released about two weeks after the singleplayer and is stand-alone. It is the successor to the immensely popular and addictive multiplayer to the original game. Although it didn't have the same legacy and lasting appeal as it. The game includes two multiplayer gamemodes. Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. Along with a handful of multiplayer maps that were portions of the singleplayer. When I first played Half-Life 2 Deathmatch I remember being a little disappointed since it lacked content and felt like a bit of an afterthought compared to other games at the time like Counter Strike Source and Unreal Tournament 2004. Indeed the game is mostly known for being full of hackers. Which is unfortunate since it did improve after release with mods like CTF. Half-Life 2 Deathmatch's legacy is now seen in the modifications that were based upon it, like Garry's Mod. If you want to play it today I'd suggest downloading a mod for bots and a few custom maps. It's a relic today, but a playable one. And at 5$ it does give you what you paid for. Nothing more, and nothing less.			"

												No achievements, no markets, no DLCs or any other BS that is an essential part of many games these days and is fairly pointless. Pure old-school (not so old tho, but old enough) with flying toilet-bowls among other moveable objects thrown in yo face that can be used as a weapon thanks to the gravity gun. It's a shame not many play it these days, I wish it were 2004 again with hundreds of servers full.			"

												All of the robust movement and physics of Half Life 2, along with the gonzo combat of the gravity gun. What's not to like? This is the next level up from the classic Quake-style competitive gameplay. It can range from realistic combat to cartoony violence, with well-balanced weapons and nicely tweakable variables. I have been playing HL2DM for years, and it can still be as challenging as you want to make it.Why is there still a community around this game after years of borked updates, minimal support, and no publicity? Because it really is that fun. It might get little love from Valve, but the participants are hardcore.			"

												An older game, as it's essentially an extension of Half-Life 2. Even though it's aged now, it still is a blast to play with friends. The Gravity Gun is what makes it so unique to many of the other shooters out there, even today in 2014. Similiar to Quake, it doesn't have a sprawling community to it any longer as Half-Life 2 is well beyond it's years now. If you get into matches you tend to get into an older community that is generally very friendly and results in some of the best games of Deathmatch, or other matchmaking playstyles. All it takes is about 5$ when Half-Life 2 goes on sale, if that even, so I'd recommend anybody who is into shooters to buy this game. I guarantee you'll have a blast in a server that is full of 6+ people, and even less in some situations.			"

												Half Life 2If you don't have the Half Life 2 game, or any Half Life game for that matter, your missing the corner stone of the Valve Corporation, (aka STEAM).  The Valve Corporation is a video game developer and digital distribution company known for the Half-Life game and others such as Counter-Strike, and Team Fortress.  I was fortunate enough to obtain HL2 for free as a promotion of Steam at its infancy.  HL2 reminds me allot of my old favourite UT game.  Way ahead of its time then.  As a FPS game, HL2 has some very wild and strange world maps.  The game physics are awesome, and the graphics for what is now considered an old game, are still amazing!  To truly enjoy the game, look into the history and trilogy of the characters and story line.Beyond tournament mode, the game has plenty of community mods, and it offers something for everyone.  Some multiplayer servers have wonderfully modded roll playing games too.  Others, puzzles and coop modes.  To play one HL2 game mode on one server, is not enough. You would be missing out.  There are endless customization's of the base game and plenty of maps.  Some of the games you play today were probably based in some way off of Half Life.  I highly recommend this game, HL2, as part of your game library.			"

												The very first game that I played on Steam. It brings back many memories of learning how to play fps games on PC and introduced me to VALVE in general. I promptly got the VALVE Complete Pack and have loved all of their games since.This game is litterally just HL2 but instead of playing through a story, you play as a rebel or combine, and fight the other faction. It is simply a Deathmatch game, but there is team deathmatch. All the hours I have put into it were mostly from long ago, but every time I launched the game I had fun with friends, and even made some new ones. I have no idea how popular it is now, but if you still have a group of friends that like to play it you can host your own server and play, or even find one of the empty ones to join.			"

Installed it, everyone was playing better than me. I was always dying but i couldn't give up, it was fun. I learned some bunny hop in a local server and improved myself. I was getting better. Oh, and there was alot of Roleplay servers. Now theres only 1, at least there was only 1 in 2015. I started steam with this game. I had a limited user account and i couldn't add people. I met someone, he bought me Portal 2. I really owe him now and i dont know what happened to him. I played Portal 2 and finished the game. Then i started to play coop and i met someone, guess what? He bought me Garry's Mod and that was where did my life began.Now theres only russian people. In every server. Expect the one roleplay server i was talking about.tl;drcan still bomb mosques 10/10			"

												Greeeeat game. Idk why people dont play it anymore but you can always find servers that contain lots of different gamemodes. This is a great game if you want a break from cs:go or etc because of the fast gameplay and the maps included or downloaded from comunitty servers.

												This game is nearly dead but it is good since it has a large community on the killbox servers that you might encounter. I must say that this game does remake the old Half-life 2 feeling but in multiplayer. I say you should pick Half-life 2 Deathmatch up it is worth it in the end. My final rating for this game is a 9/10. (would be 10 if the game was not so dead.)			"

												I will recommend this game to you because it is a great mod for killing people in half-life and have a challenge with no AI computer idiots in Half-Life, Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2 Episodes. Now I know this is old for writing a review, but I really don't care what anyone thinks because I'm DIFFERENT, and I'm proud to be, so if you're starting to dislike me I really don't care. Now back to the review shall we? -Gameplay:There is not bugs to offer in the game and gameplay is pretty smooth so I'm happy with this game-Graphics:The graphics are great for two-generation old textures.-Score:Now I know that my review is realitively short because a deathmatch game is just deathmatch so there's not really any features, but the score is 9.1/10. I'll give some room to improve.			"

-Quick Review-Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is basically Half-Life 2 multiplayer, with custom made maps in Source SDK and a few members within the community still playing.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: Now, this is the story all about how. Atratzu life got flipped-turned upside down. And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there. I'll tell you how I became a red splat on the side of the wall.Half-Life 2: Deathmatch suddenly appeared in my steam library, I believe it was recently added to a bundle that I've purchased (specifically, with my past purchase of Half-Life 2: Episode One). Half-Life 2: Deathmatch used to be a very large FPS community which started after the huge success of the Half-Life 2 series. But because Half-Life 2 is only single player, the community asked for a multiplayer competitive game, and valve delivered.

Gameplay: Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, controls EXACTLY like Half-Life 2. Which honestly I always thought I would be alright at a Half-Life multiplayer FPS, but it's been a long time since I played through all the Half-Life 2 games, so my skills were quite rusty.You have the same weapons, but the maps/servers are customized. I joined and played a Free for all, and a team death match. There is still several active people playing the game, at the end of one game people were actually congratulating the person who got first!I'm not sure if it's because so few play the game that they're all a tighter knit group, or I just found the one small patch in space time where people are still friendly, but it was nice to actually play a few rounds with some people who aren't screaming little kids swearing and speaking profanities they cannot comprehend.

Conclusion: To be completely honest, I haven't been on a FPS craze for a long time, the game has aged the same way as Half-Life 2. If you ever wanted to play a multiplayer FPS of Half-Life 2 there are plenty of servers, many are empty, you could even figure out the technical know-how to set up your own server and own maps.

I actually probably have used source SDK more then Half-Life 2: Death Match. It's a shame to see a community shrink so much, but props to those of you who keep playing one of your favorite games, don't change and keep on shooting!			"

												This review will be incredibly short as I have next to nothing to say about this title.Half Life 2 Deathmatch is a multiplayer add on for Half Life 2, but it's very similar to every early MP attempt Valve have made. I haven't played much of this game due to the simple fact that this game is completely dead. I played a few rounds of deathmatch but that was it.Recently I wanted to play a bit more, but all servers were empty so getting into a game was next to impossible.I'm guessing since it's like every valve MP game that's dying or dead, there's a ton of community events or people that  play it all the time.I can't recommend this game due to the fact that it's completely dead, so there's no reason to play it.

												Half-Life 2 Deathmatch has the distinction of being miles above what the old Half-Life 1 Deathmatch was due only to one single addition. The Gravity Gun. This little device turns what is and otherwise fairly mundane multi-player experience into many hours of high powered fun. Killing people with toilets never gets old.It is however, Half-Life 2. So if you own Half-Life 2 Deathmatch you already have access to literally hundreds of free multi-player games, many of the using the gravity gun or similar devices and in much more interesting ways than the basic Deathmatch you got here.So while it is by far more entertaining than what was included as a multi-player mode in the original Half-Life it is just the basic Half-Life 2 multi-player and not really worth much.

Once I composed myself after flattening my friends with column heaters and filing cabinets, The excitement and intensity of this fast-paced classic really set in. I have yet to discover a way to kill somone in this game that does not feel thoroughly satisfying. I love this title and will continue to do so for years to come with the innovative map/mod community actively supporting this game. 10/10 classic, no one should live their lives without having enjoyed the extraordinary gaming experience that is Half-Life 2: Deathmatch.

												Ahh, I remember playing this game back in 2006 when I was 6 on my old Steam account. I was playing alone on dm_runoff, grabing the RPG and killing myself and flying until the ragdoll falls on the earth on a funny position. I found it funny (I know, im a weird guy).Of course I played this game normally on servers (there was a lot of servers back then). And 8 years later I finally bought this game on my new account. When I play it I'm feeling so nostalgic.Half Life 2: Deathmatch is a fantastic Game. The gameplay is really good, the graphics is excelent, The maps are great. The only thing about Half Life 2: Deathmatch that disappointed me was the fact that a few guys play it. But when you do find a Server with players, you'll love it. A fantastic multiplayer experience, one of my childhood's games			"

Well, it clearly wasn't, but I kept trying with it. I have joined to several different servers and none of them seemed to be good, for me this game is a big dissapointment. Without your own server this game is not fun, and making one is hard due to errors. The worst thing is that, the game is forcing you to be a combine soldier, I know there is a way to change it and that worked fine, but after every team deathmatch my player model changed back, it was so annoying.

												Basically - OH COME THE F*CK ON, HOW THE F*CK IS REVOLVER INSTAKILLING IS BALANCED?It's probably best of Valve's MP shooters. Half-Life 1's deathmatch is still a lot of fun, and you probably will prefer the HL1, but if you got Source Multiplayer Pack - you can try the game out. Ever since it's Half-Life 2 it's physics based. You get the gravity gun - one of instakill weapons - and it's pure fun, if you know how to press buttons fast. Why i can't stand this game in a moments? Because of maps. Most servers don't host official maps (which are balanced, by Valve's logic), they host bullsh*t like Killbox (in HL1 it's great, but in HL2 it's basically like castration). Bots are not implemented, but you can find great bots online and practise your gravity gun skills.online is low, so find company to play and come on 4 plr server7.2/10 as a game9.2/10 as HL MP Game10/10 as valve's multiplayer game			"

												Two words: Roleplay. Servers.  What was once an amazing deathmatch-type game has steadily devolved into a hub for horny little children to roleplay, and for stoners just to be stoned.  In the servers that Aren't for roleplay, you won't really have too much fun unless you joined early, as you can guarantee everyone else will have gotten the RPG, full ammo, and have memorized every spawn location, meaning the moment you spawn, you get bombarded with rockets.  If you're lucky, you'll get 5-10 seconds before they take aim with their crossbows.  Either way, this is a game for the lucky, and for the cheap, so pick up your one-shot-kill guns, take down noobs, and feel unwarranted self-importance over your fake skill until karma catches up!  Ultimately, the appeal of the game is ruined by the overzealous try-hards who don't understand their ""skill"" ultimately ruins the game for everyone else.2/10, but only because you can throw toilets at people.

												When you first go into a server, and you see the title screen, you'll see how this game would be very crazy at first. Using the Half Life 2 weapons, and bundling it up into a game is probably an amazing way to do Multiplayer, however I noticed that this game feels like it should be a gamemode in Garry's Mod, or just an add on to the original Half Life 2; not just a game by itself. Besides that, if you had the time of you're life killing the Combine with your weapons, esepcially the nototious crowbar, you'll have the time of your life killing other players.I'll give this an 8/10			"

												This is just like the original Half Life 2, but it has an addition of multiplyer. You can choose from a variety of maps and a few customly made game modes(keeping in mind that this is suppose to be just a Deathmatch game). This is very similar to Counter Strike Source, so if you ever played that one, you'll feel right at home. You can get it for free instead of wasting 5 $ through this link if you own Nvidia: http://www.steampowered.com/nvidia/ ATI users go here: http://steampowered.com/ati_offer1a/Edit: 2014 the Nvidia offer seems to have closed down in the recent years. But the game still can be taken for dirt cheap on sales. Although by now I'd probably get a Free to Play instead or even Counter Strike considering how good the offers on Steam tend to be lately.

												The game is alive. Not much, but still alive. There are some Players and enough servers to select. On some servers there are good bots. The game is fast and fun. If you dont have much time or you just want to run and shoot, buy this. Community is not toxic either. Everyone plays for fun. Its a simple but nice game: You spawn, run, kill, die, respawn and then the same over again. IMO better and more fun than most AAA titles. It runs nice, its not bad optimized, you wont have problems.Its worth the money.			"

PROS:+ really fun gameplay+ active community+ lots of modsCONS:- can get repetitiveComment:Unlike Half Life Deathmatch and Team Fortress Classic this game has enough active players to have plenty of games to join. The gameplay is fun, easy and whacky. Just the way it should be. I got this game with some other Valve games I wanted so I played it a bit. In a summary this is a classic deathmatch style with HL2 weapons. Nothing special but surely cool multiplayer matches with a variety of weapons. Though I haven't played that much this seems like a cool old-school type of multiplayer game and I'd recommend it.			"

												This game used to be offered for free to users of NVIDIA and ATI graphics cards in promotional bundles. I think this was the first real game on my Steam account, thanks to the GeForce in one of my old laptops. The promotions aren't going anymore, unfortunately.The game itself is pretty much what it says, although there are a number of roleplaying and puzzle map servers. Released shortly after Half-Life 2 itself, it retains the sprinting system and all of the satisfying weapons, including the Gravity Gun, which makes this particular deathmatch game rather unique as well as fast-paced. My understanding of the community is that it's not very big and mostly comprised of older players like with Quake, since this game is more than 10 years old. I haven't played this in a while, to be honest, but it was pretty good for me back in the day for what that's worth.There are two new weapons introduced in this game: the Combine nightstick and the SLAM mine. The former is slower but more powerful than the crowbar, the latter can be used as a tripmine or a remote explosive. The default maps are quite good, but there's quite an arrangement of custom maps as well.I'd recommend it, but on sale. If the community were larger, I'd recommend it at full price. Fortunately, Valve games go on sale regularly with the annual major sale cycle, and if you can get a couple of friends to buy it as well you're probably in for a good time. You don't need to own HL2, but if you buy or have bought HL2 you might already have this.			"

												The one down side to this game is that no one plays it anymore and that the revolver is OP. It’s fun to play gravity gun only throwing toilets and explosive barrels at your enemies. It’s a shame not many people play on this game anymore you’ll be lucky enough to find a few servers with people to play with. I thought the game was pretty fun but it was annoying when people master the revolver and you just keep getting 1 shotted when u spawn.  For $5 it's not bad if you can find servers.

Some of the greatest weapons brought together to give you one of the greatest deathmatches of all time. I strongly recommend it to anyone who has played Half-Life 2 and liked the weapons used in it. However, it's just like any other deathmatch, so, really, I wouldn't say it's the best deathmatch ever created, but it's definitely good! Definitely worth the money if you liked Half-Life 2 and mastered the weapons!-Kyle James			"

												  What can I possibly say that hasn't been said abouth HL2: Deathmatch? It's all good, classic, old-style shoot-everything arena style fun. Though I must say it does tend to drag after about an hour or so playing straight. If you're gonna get this game, make sure you either find a good server or some friends to play it with because sadly this little gem probably ha slittle online life left. Whenever I get on, more than half the servers have nobody on them and another 1/3rd is way too customized or geared towards veteran players. Provided you can get some people to play with, this game is awesome. Throwing toilets at your friend's heads at 80 miles an hour has never been so fun. It's cheap and definitely worth the price- get it of you have some minor cash lying around, during a neat sale or just getting the whole damn Valve pack!			"

												I think this game is really cool and addicting, because i love being able to play an actual team deathmatch game with half life weapons and tactics, like getting a barrel with the gravrity gun to stop gunfire from the enemies and then just launch it at them. The only problem about the game is the matchmaking system, you have to keep scrolling down servers until you actually find one with people and little ping, but once you are in a server, you are guaranteed to have fun.

												I sincerely love Half Life 2: Deathmatch. Half life 2: deathmatch is a PVP First Person shooter that uses a Half Life 2 system. Half life weapons, sounds, playermodels, etc. There is also maps created by other people that are fun to play on. This game is the BEST shooter I have ever played. I have never had this much fun playing a FPS. This game is severely underrated. The game may look bland to the eyes, but this game is tons of fun and it has action. Using half life 2 weapons means you also have the gravity gun, which you can use to pick up objects and throw them at people to kill them which is awesome. There are also the exploding barrels. There is lots of variety in this game and I highly-highly recommend getting it.			"

												The game is slowly dying, but who would expect from a 12 year old game.(Don't let that statement alone stop you from playing this game.)It's fast paced, has thousands of maps, great weapon designs, and more. It is easy to play with no recoil and very low firing inaccuracy and is the first FPS I got into and remains to be my favorite.The most popular servers include Killbox, where you are surrounded by weapons and objects to kill each other with in a closed and confined area, usually with low gravity and instant respawning; Roleplay, where you roleplay as jobs such as a drug dealer or robber to make money, team up with other players or kill and steal from them, attack the police, or play as them to end players' hidden drug operations and send the criminals to jail; Co-op, where you solve various puzzles, adventure through maps, and sometimes fight bosses; Deathrun, where you run through a course full of traps to avoid dying and a player is selected to activate these traps to kill the players. If you make it to the end, you get to battle the player in control of the course in a mini-game of your choice, and of course, the classic Deathmatch, with all types of maps, many with secrets and tricks for you to learn. There is all types of weapons are spread out all around, forcing you to choose to either run over and get an RPG through a hidden tunnel, or a revolver in an open area on the ground. This is the gamemode that this game was made for and is by far the most played and enjoyed by the remaining community.In short, It's cheap, fun and underrated.10/10			"

												I'm pretty sure I got this for free, or as a gift once upon a time.... Either way, it still has plently of active players in it to make it ""alive"", and is a classic deathmatch game. With that being said, most of the players are vets; leaving anyone new a meaty target for free kills.			"

												  What can I possibly say that hasn't been said abouth HL2: Deathmatch? It's all good, classic, old-style shoot-everything arena style fun. Though I must say it does tend to drag after about an hour or so playing straight. If you're gonna get this game, make sure you either find a good server or some friends to play it with because sadly this little gem probably ha slittle online life left. Whenever I get on, more than half the servers have nobody on them and another 1/3rd is way too customized or geared towards veteran players. Provided you can get some people to play with, this game is awesome. Throwing toilets at your friend's heads at 80 miles an hour has never been so fun. It's cheap and definitely worth the price- get it of you have some minor cash lying around, during a neat sale or just getting the whole damn Valve pack!			"

												This game is one of the best FPS's evermade.Really hard to get into if you want to become decent at it, but that's whats fun about it, it's really hard to get good at but at the same time fun. The only problem is that the game is basically dead and no one plays it anymore, it was way more active 2011 than it is now. Some servers are good but others aren't because they dont allow the skills that comes with this game such as Bhopping, knowing spawns, gravity-gun tricks and other stuff. Im pointing my finger at you JKAL.Solid game that sadly has been abandoned by people.One of my all time favorite FPS's with in-depth mechanics which takes hours to master.Score 9,5/10 Worth every penny.

												If you beat HL2 and have a incredible combat skills in the game, I would pick the game up, I got this free when I got a 20$ Croma 3 case, Due to my knowledge from hl2 and gmod combat I was able  get 92 kills in under 20 minutes, so if you are an expert at HL and looking for a game to play, pick this up, but the only con is Ive estimated about 92 active players.

												Just good, dumb fun where you can throw caution to the side and enjoy Half-Life 2 in multiplayer.Positives:-Nobody is serious or having a go at you for playing badly-Genuinely good source based  FPS-As good quality as any Valve game ever.Negatives:Crossbow bolts can glitch when they hit ladders making the ladder unusable until the server resets.Overall really fun game :D			"

												Saw this and thought of buying it some time ago and a few days later i saw it on my games for no reason so i gave it a try. Even though i'm terrible at it, its tons of fun and i'm sad to see the game is basically dead by now with maybe 5 servers with people actually playing on it, this is a severely underrated game and i feel like it deserves more attention.I'd give it a 9/10.

												Pretty fun game its similar to the first HL deathmatch, with the addition of the HL2 wepons on other players. The maps are open ended and theres alot of room for all out battles in any part of the map. Taking from arena shooters like the previous game, items are scattered around the map some in great places to abuse the re-spawn, others not so much but you get by. The majority of the games servers however are saddly empty. When getting a server list youll find that it will only get about 20 servers of wich 90% of them are empty. You will still find 2 - 3 servers with about 5 - 10 players at most, if youre lucky youll find a server with about more than 10 people. Said players also use voice chat and help out new  players but be warned that these people are the same players that have been on this game since the old days when the servers on this game were populted, so going against them will seem very tough. Still its a very nice deathmatch game, if you are a fan of the HL series and like deathmatch games this wouold be a nice addition to pick up. Keeping in mind the points that ive previously mentioned theres always the chance there are still players in quite a few number of servers.			"

												I remember first playing this game about 8 years ago.  I went under the name ""Sharp-Shooter"" at the time, and it was my first experience playing an FPS with other players.  Unfortunately, that experience would turn out to be a bad one.Many of the weapons in this game require little to no skill to use, or have a secondary fire that requires no skill.  With many of them, you can be very vague with your aiming and yet be rewarded with ridiculous damage (usually an instant kill at full health).  An example of this would be the secondary fire for the pulse rifle.  Anyone who has played singleplayer Half Life 2 knows that this is a fairly large orb that rebounds off of all surfaces and instant kills any target it hits regardless of current health.  Well, in Deathmatch it is no different, but this is a problem for two reasons.  The first being that there are other weapons, such as the primary fire for both the SMG and pulse rifle, which have been nerfed considerably in this game compared to the campaign game.  The reduced damage meant that you had to keep your aim on target at all times for the best effect which requires concentration and practice.  The orbs having no reduction of any kind therefore makes this unfair as anyone could take down someone skilled at using the primary fire with no effort at all.  The second is that the orb's ability to rebound everywhere means that there is little chance of avoiding it, and the user could get kills without so much as seeing their targets, or even knowing where they were at the time.But that's just one example.  And yet the majority of the community somehow convinces itself that every weapon in this game is equally as hard to use as everything else.So do I recommend this game?  Well, not really.  If you are looking for a fair and skill-based game, this is not for you.  It forces you to play in a way that requires no effort,  which if you refuse to do as I did, will leave you with the stress of losing constantly regardless of how hard you try or how skilled you are.  Then again, like with anything, it is still up to you.			"

												A lot of people say the original is always better then the sqeual. I have to disagree. This is a game who does it right when they say ""Alright god dammit we're gonna make a second chapter of this game and where gonna do it right!"". There is so much to say about this game, the massive cult following it's gain to it's various RP servers it's spun off in GMOD. It's massive amount of lore to it's amazing combat system. It's nothing but amazing! There is so much to learn, so much to enjoy, so much to love! I know I sound like I'm kissing ♥♥♥ when I say this but this game makes me love valve more than anything. Either being the same badass scientist that crawled his way out of that hell hole known as Black Mesa smashing Crowbars into the ugly guls of Alien Monsters now into the Gasmask of Metro Police Officers that opress a civilian populace under a Universal Union Banner in the name of ""Civil Status"". Or riding around in a scrapped sports car with a rather attractive but at the same time a TRUE strong and independant female character Alyx. You feel like a badass actually doing something for a resistance, no, a revolution for mankind being enslaved by a Alien Empire. This game is perfect. This game is art.			"

												Gamers beware! From my experience with this game I can easily say that it's general idea is a good one. However I have to not reccomend this for one reason. Hackers. Unfortunately this game has no administration or report mechanic, due to it's age. So every other server I play on has an invisible player or an aimbot. The most recent game I played, the top level on the leaderboard had a KD of 35-0. That same player was using invisibility. So again, if you like the idea and can handle the hacks, go for it. Otherwise I wouldn't waste space in your library.			"

												Man I love the Half-Life series.I bought this game because:1) It was on an off sale week.2) I wanted to play some type of ""Half-Life 2 Shooter/Free play/Deathmatch"" kind of game and I haven't found that in Garry's Mod.And oh boy how I'm disappointed.I wanted to play Half-Life 2 Deathmatch Vanilla, and i failed to find one with good connection (which is hard as i live in Brazil). Almost ALL of the servers are flooded with these annoying mods like explosive crossbow, intense weapon reskins, annoying kill sounds. I would accept at maximum that gravity mod and other really simple mods.Even though this game has a little quantity of weapons, they are INSANELY unbalanced. Rarely you will spawn without getting killed in 3 seconds with rocket launchers or one shot kill crossbows.Or you join a server expecting to kill some people, or more probably get killed, and you end up in a roleplay server. I thought a paid for a shooter.So I had enough of multiplayer, and I went try singleplayer with bots. And guess what? There was no singleplayer bots, and I had to download an addon. The mod was annoying as hell to use, as I needed to write a line of code to spawn only 1 bot (meaning i had to spam that line to max up). Also, the bots were constantly getting stuck and flooding my console with errors. But in the end, I had more fun playing with these broken bots then in multiplayer.The game also feels abandoned. Servers usually had 3 dudes playing on it and there was no dedicated servers.Though many of these problems are not the game's fault. It's more the people who use it, and the terrible country I live in. I had an awful experience with this game, though you should still try it out.			"

												Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is the multiplayer version of Half-Life 2 and is a fast-paced First-Person Shooter.You are provided a lot of ways to kill your opponents, such as shooting SMG's, Shotguns and pistols, throwing grenades or using the gravity gun to launch props at enemies. The game doesn't have a big community and there are a lot of empty servers, but there will always be enough players to fill at least 9-10. As a new player you will die a lot, the skill ceiling of the game is big and people with thousands of hours still play and wreck newcomers. The psysics engine is good and the players have made many maps. Also, there are a couple of servers with mods.Whichever prop you launch, the kill icon will always display a toilet. Cause, why not? "

												HL2 Deathmatch. was one of the first games ever on my steam. I played it all day when i came home from school and had so much fun in it. The PVP is some cancer Call of duty kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥ but the main Coop maps and Puzzel maps are alot of fun. They can sometimes bring out the Friendship and Teamwork in ppl and if you get bored there is allways the CityRP maps. there kinda like the dirty cheap version of Gmod DarkRP.			"

												6/10: Great for it's time.All I can say for Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is that it has potential. However, Most (Not all) of the community for this game is dead. If Valve kept up with this game by advertising it on the front page of steam, added achievements/trading cards, bot support, more maps that added objectives and game modes that would keep the game interesting, and, made the game free? it's community might revive itself. I wouldn't recommend this game currently due to its inactivity.			"

												The main strategy of this fast-paced FPS game is to pick up an object such as a barrel and shoot it at your opponent using your Zero Point Energy Gun 'Gravity Gun'Or by standing inside of a container, waiting for someone to spawn so that you can happily shoot them from behind. Also, Steam is hosting an offer for those wth NVIDIA. If you have it, you can get the demo of portal Half-Life 2 Deathmatch, and Half-Life 2 Lost Coast for free.			"

												Half Life 2: Deathmatch is definitely my favourite source for a fun multiplayer experience to waste many hours, get some gibs, and probably be gibbed much more.I find the simplistic nature of it, similar to Quake days, but with the unique flavour of Half-Life with the Gravity Gun, to be a much funner experience than that of what Team Fortress 2 brings. Less can be more, and HL2:DM excels in what it tries to do.Before TF2, there was HL2:DM for me, and 9 years later, it still feels great logging into a server, hearing the screams of all of those around me that endlessly kill one another, and try to survive in it all, so that just maybe I can make it on the top of the scoreboard by the end of the round.Rating: 5 Thrown Toilets / 5			"

												Recommendation for this game? No. This game is extremely fun in my opinion but it's dead. People have tried getting it popular but they have failed. If you're going to get hl2dm you mine as well not get in and get hl2 instead. hl2dm is dead period. It has less than a population of 200 and doesn't provide much content(since it's old) and isn't updated frequently because Valve doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about this game. I've seen a lot and Im thinking the game is going to die(as in 10 players tops everyday) somewhere next year or the year after that. The game can be fun and all but the only I reason I would get this at this time is play RP servers and socialize. Other then that there is no point in playing this game.Conclusion: No, only if you want to play a good game that is populated + this is a multiplayer ""accident"" game.   But for RP? If you like RP then try it out and try a decent populated RP server.EDIT: lol wtf was in my mind making this lol this sounds ♥♥♥♥ing stupid atleast i made this was when i was 14 but i mean... has much changed? prob not			"

												I'd be recommending it if it wasn't for the following: The 2010 Orange Box update that ruined the game for most of us, resulting in many leaving the game. Most techniques were simply not working anymore. The SteamPipe update deleted my files in the <username> folder. Lost a lot of work. The community. This has to be a problem. Some servers are really good, with a good community, but what destroyed the game is the russians. I'm not going to put a capital letter on it because they're not worth it. They cheat themselves and ban legit players (like me for example), who are accused of cheating. All that's happening is that they want to monopolize the game. Stay away from match servers hosted from russians. Sometimes, when fragging them in public, they are going to ask you for a 1on1 just to prove themselves, just ignore them. Cheaters. There is a cheat going on, ruining everybody's fun. Until this is fixed, stay away from DM servers. "

												In my Opinion Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is not very fun. From the fact that there's no weapon balance, and with jerks who throw props around aimlessly, this Game is not recommended by me. The worst part about this game is the amount of Chaos at one time. Don't get me wrong, Chaos is not a bad thing, but when everyone's in a room picking up Toilets, Boxes, Explosive Barrels, Furniture, etc; then it's an awful thing. This game is just ""Half-Life 2"" put in Multiplayer format, and It seems like a good idea, but ultimately fails in the end.			"

												Valve couldn't have spent less time making a multiplayer for Half-Life 2. It's understandable that Half-Life 2 is meant as a single-player game, but if you're going to include a multiplayer you better do it correctly or not at all. I don't think I have ever been so bored playing a game as this.Score: 3/10 "

												What's the point of this game? It's nothing but spawn campers insta kills and it's hard to move any where without getting INSTA KIILED! I launched the game for the first time thinking it will just be last man standing, but then I saw the title screen and there were rebles and combine, so I thought ok so it's team deathmatch and I joined a server with a decent amout of people in it and the first thing I saw was a player flying straight twords me and one shot me with an smg. I was starting to get confused because the description of the game says ""Play straight deathmatch or try Combine vs. Resistance teamplay."" But it doesn't say anything about spawn camping or insta killing. So I tried another server and the same thing was happining people camping every where because they knew if they moved any where they would die. So really this game is the devil in disguise, don't get this game unless you want to be that guy. I'm lucky though, I didn't spend any money on this game, it came free with half life 2 episode 2.

												There is no point in playing this today. I regret ever downloading. You run around with all the guns you get in the HL2 campaigns and shoot other players with no objective, it's like a dumbed-down version of arena shooters like Unreal Tournament, Quake, etc. However, Half Life Source Deathmatch is of historical significance, as some of the greatest ever multiplayer games, like TF2 and CS:GO, started off as mods of it. But like seriously, don't waste your time and go play those aforementioned shooters instead. TF2 is free and CS:GO is $15, that's great value.			"

												Valve listen this is one of your best games however it does not have a good playerbase anymore, like you did with TF2 and dota you need to make this game free to play. So overall if you have some friends who all adore half life and will play it with you, or just if you want some fun but be aware that the community is DEAD!			"

												A waste of $5 in its purest form.Having been long-since abanonded by Valve at the time that I'm writing this review, this game is filled to the brim with cancerous, plug-in coated servers that constantly spew obnoxious and eardrum bursting sounds and obscenities at you. Perhaps the base game was good, but at this point, leave this game in the grave that Valve put it in.			"

												My review for Half-Life 2 can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/220I personally enjoyed Half-Life deathmatch a great deal and had an amazing explosive online experience. While Half-Life 2 surpassed the incredible Half-Life singleplayer it's multiplayer did not thanks to the lack of interesting weapons and time itself. No one is playing this. The physics are neat but Half-Life 2 weapons were not the best part of Half-Life 2. They weren't bad or anything but when all your doing is shooting the problems HL2's arsenal had start to show. It never had a lot of support and the maps on offer are quite dull compared to HL1's which is a shame. The year is 2016 and I can think of no reason to play this as it doesn't even have bots (Mods don't count and the bots mod for this is hard to find and hard to install.) meaning that you would be spending 5 dollars to move around an empty map thinking sad thoughts like ""Will I be alive to see Half-Life 3?"".My review for Half-Life 2: Episode 1 can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/380My review for Half-Life 2: Episode 2 can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/420My review for Half-Life 2 Lost Coast can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/340 "

WIthin 5 minutes, I was so fustrated by the one-sided battles that it stopped being fun. Honestly, if you dont mind dying a lot and  rarely making a kill, the guns and maps are fun> however, for most players, it will be aggrevating. Trust me, go TF2 instead.			"

												I like this game. It's pretty fun, and you get it when you purchase EP1 so you can have a multiplayer experience.I don't get everyone calling this game empty; It feels somewhat empty, but theres about 20 servers to play on with real people and almost no bots. I wouldn't call it empty, I say it has one foot in the grave. The community is in great shape for 2015, just like CS 1.6. There's still people playing, and there's also a lot of English people.Also, this game is hard to master. People can kill you with radiators, tooth brushes, rubber ducks (yes) and other objects you can pick up with the gravity gun. Once you get it, you'll have lots of fun. Also, DO NOT BUY IT HERE. Go buy HL2 EP1. It comes with EP1, Deathmatch and Deathmatch Source. You'll truly get a bang for your buck.			"

												I dont remember buying this so i must have gotten it free with something else from valve.Before buying this game i would recommend to ask in the discution if it dying, dead or not and in the worst case scenario you will need to find friend to play it with before buying it.But it is so old that i cannot recommend it, there are way more recent and better game with DM out there.

												Would not recommend. Sorry :C unless you REALLY just like deathmatch games in general (and hey, some people do) and also creative ways of killing people, like with toilets, then you probably shouldn't get this. It IS really cheap, but even then, there are GMod gamemodes that are just like this. Plus, I'm not sure many people play it anymore.			"

												BY GOD why would something with the word DEATHMATCH in its name have its own game? why would anyone want to buy an online multiplayer fps game that only has deathmatch? WHY? and its not even a good game. if your new to the game like i was you just get owned by everyone espesually when its in a map that hase so many openings. once you spawn YOU DIE. all u ever need is the revolver and crossbow and THATS it. there arent even any cool weapons other than the ar2(wich is useless btw) unlike the first hld (wich shouldnt have its own game either) wich had a ton of cool weapons (but thats probably because hl1 had cooler weapons then hl2) plus using the grav gun isnt gunna help u. sometimes there are servers that dont even give u the grav gun(btw good luck on trying to find a server that dosnt have crazy plugins)(just like in tf2 wich is definitely better than this game) this game shouldnt cost money its just deathmatch. it seems like it would be like a gmod special game mode. (cant say the same about the first hld). the only reason you should buy this gameis A if your buying hl comeplete wich for some reason has tf1 in itor B so you can have all the gmod mountswich is both the reasons why i have this gamebut its just MY OP			"

												During a wedding reception of a young couple the guests decided on a drunken game of hide and seek. It was decided that the groom was “it” and he eventually found everyone but his new bride. Eventually the man became furious and decided it wasn’t funny anymore and left her there. As weeks went by he accepted that she’d had second thoughts and went on with her life so he did the same. A few years later a cleaning lady dusted off an old trunk in the attic of the building where the reception had taken place, out of curiosity she opened it. Inside the trunk was the rotted body of the missing bride who’d apparently became locked in the trunk she’d hid in. Whether she’d suffocated or starved was unknown, but her face was frozen in a scream and there were huge scratches in the inside of the trunk where she had tried to get back to the man she loved.

												Half-Life 2 Deathmatch is a great game but Its unbalanced and has a terrible community. Pretty much anyone who plays this game nowadays are spawn point campers that'll put mines on every spawn point possible and Muslims that make fun of you and crack a 911 joke at any given time. This game can still be good if the spawn points couldn't be camped. Over all this game is good but no one plays it anymore.			"

												In addition to having very few servers with more than five people playing at a time, you will spend 90% of your time downloading custom server files, and the rest of the time realizing that the servers you join, even though advertised as deathmatch, are playing some indescribable and unplayable version thereof in awful maps. This was a complete waste for something that could have been a lot of fun and provided countless hours of gameplay. If there was ever an actual game here, it has been long dead.

The servers are fantastic giving varieties of different game mode servers such as co-op zombie killing servers, deathmatch servers, TDM servers, build puzzle servers, roleplay servers and many more. If you're looking for a game that has these modes, then HL2 Deathmatch is just for you!			"

												One of my favorite multiplayer games. I've spent over two hundred hours playing it, and playing mostly user-made maps. It was a lot of fun, though I'm sure not much is happening in servers now; it's been a long time. One things for sure, the days of custom maps are over, and if you missed them, you'll never know how much you missed. Still, give this game a shot. I'm sure you just got it with a bundle, and yeah, mostly hardcore fans will be playing. That just shows their dedication to a game worth reviving, though even I got a little frustrated the last time I played. Maybe HL3 deathmatch...too bad that will never happen.			"

												Didn't get a chance to play HL2 Deathmatch until last year but I was pleasantly surpised to find a ton of people still into this game. I've spent at least a dozen late nights with this game and it's a very nice change of pace from the more ""serious"" shooters like CoD or CS. I say give it a shot.			"

												This game is great for half life and FPS lovers alike. You can run around as a rebel or combine is many different game modes spraying guns of all types from the half life world. and when death occurs you rag doll so hard. if you like constant killing and death then killbox is for you. there are some old school servers where teamdeathmatch is the mode and you must pick weapons up off the ground. there is the occasional death run servers to spice things up and for the grav gun expers there is a few gravity gun and physics only killing servers.I just wish there were some acheivments that could be awarded. ive been playing this game for about 6 years now and it never gets old. I would highly reccomend it to anybody.			"

However, HL2 DM is a different beast altogether. It was good at first, but it had problems, then Valve seemed like they would never update it, but eventually they did. However, the update didn't address any of the big issues, only things like removing wall strafing, and some tweeks to the netcode (which didn't seem to help at all) because the game is plagued with latency issues. Sure, the score screen will say you have good ping, but getting killed around corners, or visually getting the drop on somone results in barely any damage and your death. HL1 had similar issues as it and pc tech matured, which I was able to overcome by simply installing a new, faster video card, but with HL2, proximity to the server overruled any new graphics tech you wanted to throw at it. I ran a HL1 DM server back in the day and it sat in my bedroom, mere inches away from my ""play"" computer, which showed me firsthand the advantage of proximity, so I was able to recognize the effect in HL2 DM. I haven't even mentioned the physics issues because they are mere annoyances.. with a map full of movable objects (by way of the gravity gun) it introduces more lag for the average player, and those objects also offer the agrivating possibility of getting stuck, or otherwise hampering movement. So, overall, I don't recommend this game mode unless you are highly competitive and don't mind the impediments. I love the game for deeper reasons, but I had to quit this mode as it just never got the love it deserved and I got older and less patient. :)			"

												Basically it's Half Life 2 but in deathmatch. Might sound pretty awesome on paper but it really isn't. Physics based deathmatch is pretty fun, but the problem is that props can easily spell the end for you and kill you in one blast, pretty cheap to be honest, and the whole gameplay of shooting props at one another gets old pretty quickly. The community is pretty much mostly gone, leaving behind little kids who got this game for free. Why can't this game be more like Half Life 2 survivor's battle mode? Well, I guess western PC gamers don't like interesting things, or because Valve really doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about Half Life anymore after 2007. CSS and TF2 gets years of countless updates, but HL2 Deathmatch is mostly just stuck in the past.Most of the cool stuff has been put in gmod a long time ago anyways.			"

												So I got Half Life 2 Deathmatch on the steam sales partnered with the Games CSSOURCE and Day of Defeat, I didn't buy the back for this game at all but it provided an added bonus and so I played my games, I played a tiny bit of Half Life 2 deathmatch and to me it felt like a gmod gamemodeBut recently I revisted it, I found it really fun It quite crazy but its good fun just running around getting kills, I especially like the gravity gun in it. However it isn't exactly the largest game you get what you pay for, theres 1 mode on about 7 maps, but its a good casual game! and with some tweeking maybe even the addition of classes this could be an excellent standlone multiplayer shooter, Its good fun and you should get it its only 3.99!

												HL2DM is a great game with far better hit detection than say CSS. However, with that said the game is nearly dead. I booted it up today to find 4 servers one of which was empty, another had 2 players, a third was password protected, and the 4th had six players playing a varient with one shot 9mm kills. If it was free I would would without a doubt reccomend this game, but with a five dollar price tag and the game having such a small playerbase(almost to the point of unplayabilty) I cannot reccomend it.

There are plenty of custom levels, includng different modes such as puzzle or co-op. It brings a good bit of fun. Recommended.			"

												Honestly, it's not terrible. The problem is in trying to find a non RP server with enough players and decent latency, without unbalanced user-created maps, bad respawns, and people who giggle and spout incoherent BS into their mics the whole time. Once you find a good server, it's self-explanatory: Multiplayer Deathmatch with HL2 weapons.It's worth a try, but only as part of a pack, and only on sale.			"

												The game itself is a good, fast-paced, can be funny and would be enjoyable, however...It's 2015 we are talking about, and even back in 2010, the game was mostly played by veterans who wrecked you all the time. Of course all games have very good and pro players, but with HL2DM, it reaches the point where the game becomes boring and dull, with the same guy killing you for the 15th time in a few minutes.But it is definitely old school! No ranks, no skill groups, no unlocks, no microtransactions, nothing, you just join a server and that's it, every single player is equal, no cosmetics, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t...			"

There are plenty of custom levels, includng different modes such as puzzle or co-op. It brings a good bit of fun. Recommended.			"

												The game involves shooting other players and also using the fancy gravity gun to throw toilets and other bathroom paraphernalia around. I do sometimes worry that people might take it all to heart and start thoroughly wrecking their hosts' conveniences under the guise of being polite. Having visited some of the rougher areas of south west England, it sadly seems that public toilets are also under threat from this kind of behaviour. In conclusion, I do recommend it, but, for the sake of her majesty, please don't let it go to your head.			"

Just for the lolz, I tried it on my Windows 8.1 tablet (which has Intel Atom Z3470 1.3 GHz, 2GB RAM, 32GB storage) and it managed to get 50-60 FPS at 1368x768 with all settings maxxed except for AA and AF, with no framerate drops. I checked Task Manager and it was only using about 200MB memory. My anti-virus was using more than that! Uninstalled McAfee.DAT OPTIMISATION!!			"

There are also puzzle maps too :D. Really fun to port forward and play with friends! Recommended! +1			"

When I check today, there are a couple hundred on the servers.In the time I have had in the game, it gives a nice, fast paced deathmatch experience in Half-Life settings, using Half-Life levels. There are plenty of custom levels, includng different modes such as puzzle or co-op. It brings a good bit of fun. Recommended.			"

												I have been a HL fan since the beginning -- I got HL1 as a xmas present in '97. HL1 DM was the♥♥♥♥♥♥for many many years, so I was totally onboard for HL2 and its DM mode. However, HL2 DM is a different beast altogether. It was good at first, but it had problems, then Valve seemed like they would never update it, but eventually they did. However, the update didn't address any of the big issues, only things like removing wall strafing, and some tweeks to the netcode (which didn't seem to help at all) because the game is plagued with latency issues. Sure, the score screen will say you have good ping, but getting killed around corners, or visually getting the drop on somone results in barely any damage and your death. HL1 had similar issues as it and pc tech matured, which I was able to overcome by simply installing a new, faster video card, but with HL2, proximity to the server overruled any new graphics tech you wanted to throw at it. I ran a HL1 DM server back in the day and it sat in my bedroom, mere inches away from my ""play"" computer, which showed me firsthand the advantage of proximity, so I was able to recognize the effect in HL2 DM. I haven't even mentioned the physics issues because they are mere annoyances.. with a map full of movable objects (by way of the gravity gun) it introduces more lag for the average player, and those objects also offer the agrivating possibility of getting stuck, or otherwise hampering movement. So, overall, I don't recommend this game mode unless you are highly competitive and don't mind the impediments. I love the game for deeper reasons, but I had to quit this mode as it just never got the love it deserved and I got older and less patient. :)			"

If you can find a good server the game is actually fun! very fast paced, and very difficult to learn. still reccomend it, though you may have to search for that special server. try using zoosk.			"

												This game is great for half life and FPS lovers alike. You can run around as a rebel or combine is many different game modes spraying guns of all types from the half life world. and when death occurs you rag doll so hard. if you like constant killing and death then killbox is for you. there are some old school servers where teamdeathmatch is the mode and you must pick weapons up off the ground. there is the occasional death run servers to spice things up and for the grav gun expers there is a few gravity gun and physics only killing servers.I just wish there were some acheivments that could be awarded. ive been playing this game for about 6 years now and it never gets old. I would highly reccomend it to anybody.			"

												Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is a game that takes the weapons, environments, and game mechanics from Half-Life 2 and puts them into a PvP multiplayer game. If you couldn't tell by the title of the name, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch puts you into the boots of either a Rebel or a Combine soldier and you fight the opposing team to the death. All of the weapons from Half-Life 2 are in this game, including the Gravity Gun. So, yes, you can pick up a toilet and launch it at your enemy to kill them. You will start with a set of weapons usually consisting of a pistol, SMG, stunstick, and Gravity Gun. You will have to go searching for your other weapons including the shotgun, crossbow, magnum, and AR 2.  You can also pick up the weapon that your dead foe was using when they died. If they dropped a weapon you already have, it will be given as ammo for that weapon. Ammo, health, and suit chargers will also be scattered throughout the map. Be sure pick up those as you go. (Using health and suit chargers may leave you out in the open, so be careful of enemies.) The core character mechanics from Half-Life 2 also make a return, the only difference being that your character moves a little faster. That means that shooting while sprinting is still a thing. While it may be a bit cheap, it's still a game mechanic to be exploited. That also means that the game is a lot more fast-paced and frantic then most multiplayer FPS games on the market such as Call of Duty or Battlefield. (Note: I don't hate these two game series. So, shut up.) The maps in this game are based off of areas in Half-Life 2. While most aren't ripped straight from the game, I feel like maps like Lockdown is ripped right from Nova Prospekt, a level in Half-Life 2. There's also tons of people still playing this game. Though most servers may have bots, that shouldn't stop you from enjoying this game. Overall, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is a really fun multiplayer game. It's currently only $14.99 on Steam. You also don't need a very powerful computer to run it. So, go check it out.			"

												When it was free, it was a great deal. It came with Portal and is a fun game for the time it was made back in November 30, 2004. This game is really fun, ran with the same engine (Source) as Garry's Mod, Half Life 2 (Every Part), Counter Strike (not sure which one), and a few other great games by Valve. The graphics are good for being made in 2004, and the gameplay aspect is really fun with a friend to voice chat with. There is a variety of gamemodes (Back in 2004 there was only Deathmatch where users battled it out) but now the game has fishing, dodgeball, and many others. I would recommend Garry's Mod but if you want a cheaper equivalent get Half-Life 2: Deathmatch. Recommended for users looking for a fun game to play with friends. I think most people who own Garry's Mod should have a copy of this!			"

												I had a lot of fun playing this game. The gravity gun adds a whole new dimension to the deathmatch game. I actually like the server system. The problem is many weapons are way too overpowered and way too many maps are just boring killboxes. For instance, the crossbow was meant to be a different way of sniping that required timing and physics logic. However in close combat the crossbow's one hit kills just make close combat not fun at all. Overall I recommend!			"

												Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is the multiplayer component of Half-Life 2. It comes packed with all the classic weapons from Half-Life 2, and it includes two weapons that were cut from the main game: the Combine Stunstick, and the SLAM. Great multiplayer game, really action packed; and the fact that you can either play a full deathmatch game, or recreate the game battles with the Team Deathmatch mode (which puts the Rebels against the Combine) makes it a complete experience.

												One of my favorite multiplayer games. I've spent over two hundred hours playing it, and playing mostly user-made maps. It was a lot of fun, though I'm sure not much is happening in servers now; it's been a long time. One things for sure, the days of custom maps are over, and if you missed them, you'll never know how much you missed. Still, give this game a shot. I'm sure you just got it with a bundle, and yeah, mostly hardcore fans will be playing. That just shows their dedication to a game worth reviving, though even I got a little frustrated the last time I played. Maybe HL3 deathmatch...too bad that will never happen.			"

												I have only played this for a few hours, but I can already tell why some have thousands of hours clocked in on this game.Half life 2's gameplay is one of the best I've ever played, and playing against real people just makes it even better. It is the most fun I've had on a multiplayer game in a long time.Yes, the community might be dying, but it's not dead yet; I have always been able to get servers with a good few people on them. And even though most of them are a lot better than I am and destroy me, it's still immensely fun to play and learn the tricks to get better.Buy it.Play it.Get your friends to play it. You'll have great fun.			"

It's over 10 years old, from what I understand, so the hardware requirements aren't too heavy for a current or older gaming machine. For an older FPS it holds up well. Plenty of maps. Runs on Steam. Part of Half-Life 2. Check it out. We can always use more victims! "

This means that while Gordon Freeman and the Resistance are out trying to free our species from the death-grip of the Combine, someone, somewhere is shooting a toilet at a transhumanist with a gun. They will repeat this process ad nauseum over and over until they decide to lock themselves in a stone building, trying their best to solve puzzles for no readily available reason.			"

I found the game hard to get into at first but I now love it! The best part is picking up spiky objects with a gravity gun and lunging it at people. Yeah, I enjoyed that very much. Crossbows are good too. So yeah, overall the game is quite good but hard to get into. It's not a game I'll be playing on a daily basis but I'll certainly play it whenever I have time.			"

												A really fun game! It's kind of old at the time of writing this review though, but if you can find a server with people on it, it is a very enjoyable game. You just screw around, shoot, defy gravity, and have fun! Like I said though it's old at this point.			"

												There are custom user-made maps, so it's not repetitive. Also co-ops, in which I find more fun than in deathmatch, but that's just me. I fully recommend it if you are looking for a online multiplayer deathmatch FPS (and co-ops with the custom user-created maps).			"

												This game is quite fun, especially on Killbox, my fav. map so far. I play this game when I am bored and own dem n00bs with the crossbow. The crossbow was my fav. weapon in the original half-Life, but I feel that the HL2 crossbow has a slower projectile, just me?Good game, good game			"

												Deathmatch is far out, it gives you sore arms and handsVortegaunts sometime are funny they fold their hands in front of their bellies that means they wont attack you and you can walk right by them, one even put  on a dance show for me once lol I hate to kill them, in half-life 2 they were your friends and here they get slaughterd. Plenty of action and fun friends to play with.Next time you play, observe the Vortegaunts it makes for so much more fun if they let you walk by!!!!!!			"

												This game is really mental but fun. You can toss pretty much anything with the Gravity Gun and I think this is what was missing from the orignial Half-Life 2 game. But never the less I recommend buying this game for ever lasting fun! (And because it's only £2.99)			"
