												After playing Super meat boy, I started looking out for new games by the same developer. Edmund Mcmillen’s wonderfully strange imagination is an interesting thing to explore through his games, that’s for sure.This game was not a disappointment. At first, I had no idea what to expect, the trailer was very strange but a tad intriguing. When I came across it there was next to no information about the game and the mechanics of it on the store page and back then there was no costumer reviews to go off of. Admittedly I never actually brought it to give it a go off of the information I was given, I ended up with it from a bundle and it’s the only reason I really played it. Although I wish I had taken the leap to try it because it is well worth it.Binding of Isaac is a randomly generated dungeon crawler, one I have heard to be described as “Zelda-like” (I would have no idea about that, never played a Zelda game) you’re a young boy running from his demented mother. Who has been blinded by her hard-core Christianity and believes that the voice of god has spoken to her and told her to murder her son to prove her loyalty. So a very interesting concept, indeed.A short cut scene plays on start-up, which expands on what I just described, you find yourself wandering through randomly generated dungeon floors, fighting monsters, picking up loot and items as you go along that changes how you fight, gives you different abilities and drastically changes Isaac’s image. At the end of each floor, you fight a boss, and move on down to the next floor. It being harder than before, with a bigger space to explore and more enemies to defeat.There’s a large range of items to collect that when found for the first time is added to the “things I found” section in the main menu, so a lovely bit of collecting there to entice those OCD minded like myself, There’s new characters to unlock which vary in stats, challenges to complete and even some DLC that can extend your gameplay.You are given one life and one life only. You can find hearts to heal, but once you are dead, that’s it, you start all over again. So throughout the whole game and especially when nearing the end, it starts to put a little pressure on and gets that heart rate going. I’m not one to be good under pressure so it gets me every time. I FINALLY managed to complete the game a few times over, again, admittedly, only after I gained some “top tips” from my way-to-good-at-games brother. There have been people that have completed the game 10 times over and still not gotten bored. I think that the randomly generated dungeon element to it keeps its replay ability intact. If it were to replay the same levels over and over when you died, the game would be a lot different and no doubt a lot less popular. I have heard from friends that it is quite hard to complete without “doing your research” on the wiki or seeking tips from those nerdy minded like my brother who managed to figure all of it out themselves. I on the other hand find that kind of thing enjoyable, because it beats you every time and you work and research and try to understand the game more to finally get to that ending. I can quite honestly say that the first time I reached the end, my heart has never beaten that loud or that fast in a long time. And that sense of accomplishment you get from finishing a game, is a on a much higher scale when you work to complete this one. The music is great, it fits the setting perfectly and is great to listen to. Rarely have I actually wanted to download a game’s soundtrack, I can give most soundtracks a thumbs up but not often do I actually want to listen to game music outside of gaming.The art, as per usual in Edmunds games, is amazing. And I hear they are also looking to remake the game to have a more “retro” look, with possible multiplayer features. Which should be very interesting. For those interested you can look up “Binding of Isaac: Rebirth”.All in all, it is a great indie game, which is both fun and challenging. Definitely worth trying, I am not usually the dungeon crawler type, but this game is a lot of fun. The only fault that I had with this game, which has bothered me quite a few times now, is that I have lost my save for no reason. The game is listed as having ‘Steam Cloud’ features, but it definitely doesn't work. I haven't uninstalled the game, I haven't touched it. But recently I hopped on and seen all the progress that I had made was gone. And for a game that has no real save points or ongoing plot to keep up with, your stats, unlocked characters and collection of things you have found is pretty much all you have. I was pretty upset to see it had vanished and it’s something I felt I needed to warn people about. TL;DR : Awesome music, fun and engaging game with a slightly 'twisted' side to it. It's a challenge to reach the end and you can definitely end up putting a lot of hours into this. Addictive and awesome all around.			"

												As of writing this I am 500+ hours in and I have to say its one of the most enjoyable games I have played in a long time, It's really easy to just pick up, yet it also has the ability to make you stay playing for hours on end. Due to all the secrets, items, enemies and most importantly the difficulty it has a ton of replay value. When I say difficult I really do mean it but the more you play the more you learn how to overcome many of the challenges that the game has to offer.Another reason I enjoyed it was the randomly generated levels, this also comes with random enemies, items and secrets, so no two runs end up being the same. The game also borrows a lot from Zelda, so if you are a fan of the level design and many of the mechanics of the early Zelda dungeons and items you will probably be a fan of this.Other than the solid game play it is aesthetically pleasing because of Edmund McMillen's really fun and quirky art style.I really recommend you pick up this title and the expansion pack as soon as possible.

												The Binding of Isaac is a small game with very simple mechanics, but it will catch you with its huge amount of contents, great soundtrack and polished graphics.Sprinkled with humor and nods to gaming's past, The Binding of Isaac is a ballsy game that revels in its absurd moments. Shock value aside, you'll want to play this indie gem over and over again. It's imaginative and  utterly absorbing.I'll put it simply: If you can roll with the macabre toilet humor and if religion jokes don't put you off, AND if you enjoy games with non-optional permadeath, randomized content, tons of secrets and considerable replay value… it's hard to go wrong with The Binding of Isaac. Especially at its low price.			"

												This is pretty much a roguelike dungeon crawler with quite a bit of influences taken from Zelda, and a ton of religious/Satanic overtones and pretty taboo themes, which was probably designed for masochists....And I mean this in the best way possible.Pros+ Fun and rewarding combat+ The game is difficult, but also fair towards the player+ Nice cutesy but brutal art style+ Gameplay is random with its roguelike elements, making it very addictive+ A lot of different items and powerups to mess around with+ Multiple unlockable characters to suit multiple playstyles+ Plot has a ton of social commentary that will hopefully leave you thinking even after you stop playingCons- Can be glitchy at times- Difficulty curve can be very brutal for newcomersQuestionable? If you're a pretty religious person, you may be pretty offended by the game's style, plot, messages and humor, but you may be able to overlook these things.Overall, I would totally recommend this game to other people.

												A stream-lined rouge-like, filled with morbid imagery and religious overtones. Gratifying combat and a punishing yet fair system of bosses and enemies. The few glitches that it holds are more than made up or with a mind bending story, compelling social commentary and a wonderful community. Pros- Consistent, skill based combat       - A multitude of bosses and enemies       - Hundreds of items (Each with their own individual effects)       - Different characters supporting multiple playstyles       - Complex metagame to masterCons- Glitchy        - Learning curve like a brick wall        - Extremely punishing of mistakes and deaths        - Thick subtext (Overkill at time  [Having to literally kill yourself as a boss])A rewarding experience which captures the journey so perfectly, the destination is rendered irrelevent.

												The game is brilliant (and sooo addictive)! One of the best indie games ever. It is interesting, hard, it has exellent dark humor and atmosphere is epic. It is the game you should take with you to a Desert Island. First you will die a lot, but then (if you are curious enough and tenacious) you'll know tricks and secrets, learn every combination and manage to do crazy amazing stuff.  Music is great, very catchy and suitable, the graphics - cute and old-school.PS Mom! I love you mom, I still do :( I will go to the basement, I will meet my inner demons, fight them and win! And you will be proud, right? Or maybe I'll just play with some dead things (that you threw there), get parasites, decide that I am a cat and can fly and kill you, being one happy and absolutely crazy boy! XoXo Isaac			"

												What can I say about The Binding of Isaac. This is by far the best indie games of 2011 I have played. Old school NES Fans, you will not be disappointed. This game has a somewhat resemblance to The Legend of Zelda's dungeons. Even newer gamers will appreciate this addicting, simple yet complex Rogue-Shooter. Coming from the makers of Super Meat Boy, this is a sad comedic gore fest full of surprises. Note that You will die a lot at first but as you keep playing, there are a lot of things to unlock and discover. This game's price value is also a must get for your steam game collection. At 4,99€ you can't go wrong no matter what. Dungeons filled with disgusting and gory, yet funny and sad enemies, will leave you wanting more and more. I found myself a lot of times putting other games aside to go play this game. I will end this review short and simple.A little game with some really good working dark humor. It's very difficult but that's what makes it lasts for soo long. Very addictive game with a high replay rate.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is one of those few games I own in my library that despite its unforgiving difficulty and no saves, always keeps me coming back for more.One of the reasons for this is its gameplay. The gameplay is top down shooter brilliance. While there will be times that the game will pull a♥♥♥♥♥♥move on you, (it can be quite luck based at times) you won't be blaming your death on a bug of any description. Unless you're a sore loser, but that's your fault, not the game's.While the atmosphere may gross some very few sensitive souls amongst you, it has a reason for being that way and just enhances the (probably short) experiences throughout the game. If you've played Super Meat Boy, you'll feel right at home though, Edmund McMillen's the mastermind behind these two greats, and if you like his work, I also strongly recommend picking up the Basement Collection. Yes, I just recommended a game in another game's recommendation. (Recommendception!)The real reason why I love this game so damn much though, is its stellar replay value. Every single time you start a new game, (and you'll probably start many) everything will be randomized. Enemies, boss fights, of which many are very challenging, items and powerups (good luck getting them all eventually) and rooms (some there to just screw you up with a deadly enemy mix, others with some goodies in) are all always different. Even if you beat the game fully once, there will be more things to do every single time.Be warned though, that the DLC raises difficulty quite a bit. If you feel like you need to be eased into the game first slowly, you should play the vanilla first, and then activate the DLC. Besides that, the DLC adds tons of content and new fights and is most definitely recommended.It has amazing gameplay that keeps you coming back after getting roflstomped, great replay value, and a dirt cheap price. This game is a must in my opinion.			"

Posted: May 4, 2015
												After more than 700 hours I think it's finally time to review this game, since I think I have played a good amount to give my unbiased oppinino on The Binding of Isaac.First and foremost: Yes, I have played Rebirth. I think it was around my 500 hour mark when Rebirth was released and I was hyped like everyone else but my interest for Rebirth died down really fast and I continued playing Classic Isaac (for a more detailed review on why I prefer Classic Isaac over Rebirth, feel free to check my Review for Rebirth.)However, I absolutely love this game. I would even go so far and say that it's the absolute best game I have ever played and I started playing games when I had a SNES, so calling a game that was made in flash my favorite game of all time is a huge accomplishment.The skill cap in this game is something that is insanely good, games where you can feel that you get progressively better are very rare to come across, but the more you play it, the more you learn what which items do how you can get the most out of every single floor and of course dodging, the more you play it, the better you get at it.The cool thing is, that even after 700 hours you might not find any more secrets or anything like that, but the game never feels repetitive, since every run has a different layout of floors, the items you find are different, the bosses you find are different and the drops you find, as well.Also what this game has over Rebirth, in my opinion, is the limited amount of Items.Sure, there are people who say that at some point u just get specific items and just restart a run to the point where you get an item that is useful, so you limit yourself to a certain amount of items. But that's all up to oneself. You can either restart all time until you get your desired item, but you can also start off with a really bad item and get god-tier items along the way. The way how you play a run with a bad item and how you eventually make it work is all up to your skill at the long run.What I was trying to say is, there are less items in Classic Isaac than in Rebirth, so ultimately you have more control and it is more likely that you get an item that you actually like. As I said, some might see that as a negative, since you limit yourself to certain items, but if I play 20+ runs and only get 1 run where I get 1 item that I like, that's no fun to me.All in all The Binding of Isaac is my favorite game of all time, I would even say the benchmark for all Rogue-like games.(Eternal Edition) As far as the eternal edition go (which is an update for Isaac that was released a couple of days ago) I totally enjoy this update. It adds a Hard Mode to the gae, so for people who have played this game for 700+ hours and don't wanna switch over to Rebirth, this is a great addition, because the name ""Hard Mode"" is exactly what it says.There are ""eternal forms"" of regular mobs and bosses who are way tougher to beat. They have more hit points and different attacks. Another thing that they fixed, which they also added for the regular version, is the time you freeze whenever you pick up an item, trinket, pill, tarot- or playing card. The frame in which you freeze and can't move has been reduced which makes it easier for you to dodge enemies.Once the bugs have been ironed out (there is currently a bug where you can't get out of a room when you fight the eternal form of ""Loki"" this update will be even more awesome than it already is.As I said, if you love Rogue-likes, chances are that you already have this game, but if not, you should definitely give this game a try.I already have 700+ hours in this game and I plan to invest more hours in the future. This game never gets old.			"

""Yay cancer!"" - just Binding of Isaac quotesThe Binding of Isaac is a Flash-based roguelike dungeon crawler reminiscent of early Legend of Zelda games developed by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl. Inspired heavily from the Biblical story, the game follows Isaac (and a variety of unlockable characters) escaping from his Christian fundamentalist Mother, to whom a voice of God commands to sacrifice Isaac.* GameplayAfter escaping from his Mother’s wrath, Isaac finds himself in a basement filled with monsters. Each floor contains a set amount of rooms culminating with a boss fight that must be cleared in order to advance to the next floor. Along the way Isaac can collect pennies (nickels and dimes as variants) to spend in a Shop or an Arcade, bombs to blow up obstacles or enemies and keys to unlock chests and Treasure rooms. The items found in Treasure rooms, after completing a boss fight and other ways are the core to improving Isaac’s tears (bullets) and fighting abilities. For example, an item can make tears homing, poisonous, increase damage and so on. My favourite is the Ipecac item, which makes your tears explosive and always poisonous. If requirements are fulfilled, Isaac can after a boss fight trade his heart containers to the Devil in exchange for powerful items, or alternatively, avoid taking deals with the Devil to acquire a chance for an Offering from an Angel (Wrath of the Lamb DLC required) which can be useful as well.  The game at first seems very difficult, but as it is completed more and more times, new items, characters, alternate bosses and floors can be unlocked, ensuring there will always be a reason to explore. The game also features many references to McMillen’s other games, such as Super Meat Boy and Time ♥♥♥♥, as well as popular games such as Super Mario, Legend of Zelda and others.* Expansions and the communityWhile the base game is fairly extensive, I heavily recommend obtaining Wrath of the Lamb DLC, which adds 98 new items, a new character, new floors and many other content that improve the experience. Owning said DLC is a prerequisite for the Eternal Update, a free addon developed by Florian Himsl that adds Hard mode, which offers a brutal experience for those feeling the base game was too easy. The Binding of Isaac is very popular and well known, as a result from famous Youtube Let’s Players such as Northernlion and Bisnap. Their unique ways of playing the game have inspired many more to try the game themselves.* Closing commentsThe Binding of Isaac is a very charming (although rather macabre as well) game which is a must have for anyone interested in roguelikes. It can be obtained for 99 cents from Humble Bundles or Steam sales, DLC and awesome soundtrack included. A worthwhile play even after the release of Rebirth.			"

												I love this game! This is one of the best games I've ever played. This game gets even more fun when you download the Community Remix mod to play this. I have most of my hours in the Community Remix mod.This game is epic and nothing but flawless victory, but there are cons which is a minor part:Pros:+Great design+Unique art-style+Epic combinations of items (gets better in Rebirth)+Challenges+Many endings+Epic soundtracks by Danny Baranowski+Gives great challenge+Humorous sound effects, as well as epic onesIs good and bad:+/-Is extremely hard on the beginning, but gets easier overtime once you get used to stuff+/-Some bosses are easy to abuse with some item combosCons:-Is extremely frustrating sometimes-Overall a bit limited once you've played enough (but this is normal for any game)-Wave of bullets is literally impossible to dodge from the gaps of them because of hitbox-FliesLittle breaks sometimes are highly recommended, because it makes it extremely frustrating if you play it alot and keep constantly failing, because failing is a part of games like this.Would recommend to anyone who likes to have a challenge.9.5/10 dying often makes you have a feel of banging your head to the keyboard and scream for help.

												Let's make this Short:TL;DR:+ For that amount of Money (4,99€) you get tons of content. I've played 13 Hours and those games are not even nearly my type of Game.+ You can pick it up whenever you want. You wanna kill 5minutes? Go ahead+ Addictive. You wanna get deeper and deeper into the Dungeon. + The Game even runs on a Potato. Like legit, you can pick it up even on a Toaster.+ you will unlock different characters with specific statistics and abilities. So every run depends on YOU and your Decisions.+/- The deeper you go into the Dungeon, the harder it gets. If you rage pretty fast, don't pick it up!- NONE*RECOMMENDED*			"

												Got this game on summer sales 2015.Played it recently.All I can say is I'm hooked and it's very challenging but it's fun.At first it'll be hard for everyone but once you fully grasp the controls, you'll be fine.Vs Mom is hard but Vs Isaac is harder. Trust me when you get there, it'll be hard unless you've got very powerful upgrades to your character.Also what's nice about this game is you'll never play the same level twice cause everytime you play it'll be different. What I slightly dislike is why does my tears only shoot 4 direction, I want to it shoot where I'm clicking but I guess that is why its hard and challenging I fully recommend this game to everyone simply because it's fun, addictive and challenging.9.9/10			"

												Now, I'm not a fan of these kind of games, but....but...The Binding of Isaac is a game that sticks to you, the game you will play for many days, the game that will invoke frustration mixed with delight, the game that will change your perception on the gaming itself. This is a hard game to play, but it's worth every second of your time. Don't be a stranger - buy it, play it, and after you spend couple of hours playing it, start kicking your head against the wall.

												Where do I start? This game is extremely frustrating to get the hang of. Unless you are a god, you probably can't beat it the first time you play. It took me 42 attempts to beat all six floors and Mom for the first time. I guarantee you will lose your temper at this game at some point. And you might have to do a bit of research on the Wiki or experimenting in-game to find out what every single trinket, activated item, passives and tarot card does and which ones are good or bad for every unlockable character. You might have to take your chances with the pills, as each type is randomly paired with an ability during each run.HOWEVER!The Binding of Isaac is not, and I repeat, NOT, a bad game. As much as it is frustrating, it is really addictive. I thoroughly recommend this to fans of dungeon-styled and bullet hell games. Despite Isaac's innocent look (which he kinda is...look at those big crying eyes!), the style of enemies, rooms and pickups can be incredibly morbid and disturbing. The cries of Mulligans and the appearance of Hives are incredibly distressing, adding to the games overall atmosphere. Nonetheless this really adds charm to the game as a whole. Bear in mind this is coming from the creators of Super Meat Boy, so expect some blood along the way. But what's fun is you never know what to expect. All of the dungeon floor layouts are randomly generated everytime you start a game and aside from Mom being the last boss in the Depths, you never know what boss you will get upon entering its room. There are set bosses for every floor type and the game will randomly select one of these for you to battle. There is a sense of mystery about this game, mainly regarding the bosses, items you can find and what each pill does in every run.Now stop reading this and go buy The Binding of Isaac!!			"

												     Given the upcoming release of Binding of Issac: Rebirth, I have decided to update my review of The Binding of Issac + The Wrath of Lamb. Having doubled my playtime in the past couple of weeks i have come to the conclusion that my initial response to the game was premature.     For those unfamiliar with Issac, the game is a Rougelike Dual Analogue Shooter. this means you controll Issac (or one of his unlocakble alternates) who fights randomly spawned monsters in a procedurely generated dungeon using his own tears as bullets. Issac is heavially inspired by retro titles, especially the original Legend of Zelda, as can be seen in the way each room is a seperate yet in many ways similar mirror of each other with some room s designated as treasure or boss rooms, and the heart based life meter.     The presentation of Issac is that of a Newgrounds flash game on steriods. To be fair that description is fairly apt. the game is built on the flash engine and if it hadn't had the time, creativity, and vision applied to it that is what it would likely have ended up as. That flash comment is not meant in the derrogative though, the game looks and sounds beautiful (Mostly thanks to Danny Baranowsky). Because it sticks to the limitations of the engine rather than attempt more realistic graphics the game looks perfect for what it is.     Gameplay is where Issac truly shines. The controls are simple and tight, keeping the already difficult gameplay from becoming frustrating. The best part of the gameplay though is the items. The randomly generated items ensure that no two runs are the same. These items are most awesome when they work together (Protip-Polyphimus+Technology =Awesome.). The enemies have unique attack and movement patterns that are easy to learn but will always be able to throw you for a loop.     The only problem I have with the game is the same as it was before. The random nature of the item drops and boss spawns can make some playthroughs almost instant throwaways. This is aliviated by the sortness of the game and the rapidity of the respawn but if a few games in a row with a bad start and even I get frustrated. 8/10. Worthy of a checkout before Rebirth comes out.			"

In short, is the game good?Yes, yes and triple yes.Is it worth my time and money?Yes. Considering how cheap The Binding of Isaac + Wrath of The Lamb is, there really isn't an excuse *not to buy it*. You will most definitely sink a lot of time into the game and you will have fun.Is this game for anyone?Considering the quasi-random nature of the gameplay, some of the runs you will do will be a walk in the park, while others may be pure nightmare. If you do not enjoy dying and losing progress over and over, this game may not be for you. If that isn't the case, go for it.Linear, open-world or something else?Something else. No two runs will ever be the same. The room layout, boss encounters, items you will get and overall difficulty are mainly dictated at random. While the set pieces themselves do not change properties that much (maybe aside meeting stronger, ""champion"" versions of monsters), the way it's all set up makes every run a fresh, new experience.Gameplay mechanics, gimmicks?You run around rooms in a 2D top-down view. You collect items that change the way your character behaves (make you faster, slower, stronger, shoot more, shoot faster, etc.). Items aren't really a necessity but without them the run may be near-impossible to do (considering the later levels where enemies deal twice as much damage and bosses have a really high level of health).Graphical aesthetics, set pieces and world design?The game has a very dark and cartoony look, in some places even grotesque. Vibrant colours and simplified forms meet with dark and horror-like rooms filled with hideous monsters that look like something out of Lovecraft's or Kafka's work. All of it feels well put together and it shows that a lot of thought was put into the overall design.Audio design and soundtrack?Excellent choices in sound effects as well as in the music soundtrack. Church-like ambiency clashing with hard guitar riffs and sounds of all kinds of hideous monsters go well together, creating an dark atmosphere that is immersive and enjoyable.Plot, story?Quite unique. The top layer of the story is simple, referring to real world topics such as fundamentalism, parenting and escapism. For those brave enough to take up the challenge, the game rewards the player with a deeper meaning to the story and a bit clearer undestanding what is really going on.How does the game run?I have played and ""finished"" (that is, got the last ending, since the game never really ends) the game on my 5 year old PC (Dual Core 2.66GHz, 2GB RAM, nVidia GeForce 9600GT) and it ran without much problems in fullscreen mode and on the ""Auto"" settings. There were instances where I was experiencing severe framerate issues due to the way the game was programmed (Flash has terrible issues when drawing lots of stuff at once, since it's all vector-based). This was happening in more ""crowded"" rooms such as bullet hell-esque boss fights. Changing the settings to ""Low"" eliminated the problem for me completely. So, if you have a similar PC to mine, just set the game to Low or Medium and it should be fine in fullscreen mode. If you have a newer machine, expect way better results.Any details, character, motif, etc. you particularly liked?Yes, the D6 dice. Brings a completely new meta-game into your runs and adds a layer of careful planning.Anything you didn't like?Yes. First of all, Flash. The game could run way better if it wasn't using Flash as a rendering engine. Then again, The Binding of Isaac was meant to be a side-project so it's understandable that the creators didn't have the time and/or resources to write a fully functional, brand new, custom engine from the ground up. Although that will probably change since The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is set to come out not too far from now. Second, no controller support. While that's not a dealbreaker, it could've been easily patched in. Instead we see a ""recomendation"", in the options menu, to use Joy2Key. That's not a very professional way of doing things. On the other-hand, the game can be played without problems using a keyboard, so it's not a terribly big issue. Finally, lack of item descriptions. I understand that there's an element of learning when picking up items but a short description of what item does what would be nice. Instead, new players (along with myself) had to use the wiki to check if they want to really pick up this or that item.Final score?I give The Binding of Isaac (+The Wrath of The Lamb) a Mom's Knife out of 5.

												Definitely a must-have for any Steam member. I will admit I didn't enjoy the game at first, but over time it grew on me and I soon realized the charm and brilliance of it. Edmund McMillen did great on this revival of the dying genre of Rogue-like games, and added his own element of unique and fascinating artwork, similar to his previous title, Super Meat Boy. Overall, this game is great, because it brings together so many great elements for a game to have into one wholesome title, making it enjoyable for everyone except those who don't take time to see the beauty of a game.

												Few games can truly claim to walk the fine line between fun and frustration as much as The Binding of Isaac, another hellishly difficult title from Edmund McMillen: the man behind Super Meat Boy. It’s a title that delights in pushing players to the point where they want to start taking swings at their computer before attempting another round guiding its titular tyke through a series of nightmarish and randomized dungeons.A brief animated intro sets up the threadbare plot: Isaac is a young boy living a happy life at home with his mom until she starts hearing the voice of God and hiding him from the evils of the world. It isn’t long until Isaac is permanently locked in his room and awaiting execution at the hands of his mother at the almighty’s behest. Escaping into the basement, Isaac begins his bizarre journey.The Binding of Isaac somehow manages to be disturbing as it is endearing with its balance of gruesome monsters and matching setting with its adorable, wide-eyed sprites. Dungeons are splashed in every foul bodily fluid imaginable—blood, guts, tears, urine, and even an uncomfortable amount of feces. Imagine Hellraiser filmed through the lens of a Saturday morning cartoon for kids. The bestiary is equally grotesque. Armies of maggots and flies are frequent foes, and headless children spewing fountains of blood from their necks are a common sight.Bosses take things a distasteful step forward: fetuses, conjoined twins, fat slugs urinating on the floor, and even Isaac’s mother are just a few of the end-level bosses that need to be dealt with. Keep in mind that the protagonist is also a perpetually-naked boy using his tears as projectiles. The Binding of Isaac is a pretty sick game with aesthetics that would appeal to one’s inner horror fan and Splatterhouse enthusiast. It isn’t going to be to everyone’s tastes, but those that enjoyed Super Meat Boy are probably going to find themselves like McMillen’s perverted sense of style.Since the dungeons are randomized, there’s no telling what you’re going to find whether it be a useful power-up or more monsters. This makes memorization of each level impossible and keeps the experience fresh every time. On the downside, this means success depends on good luck and players will often lose because they were dealt a bad hand. Every time Isaac dies, players wind up right back at the start of the game and even the most patient of individuals will become infuriated by such a design choice. After putting in so much effort and acquiring a myriad of useful abilities, it feels way too harsh.The randomness extends to the power-ups themselves, as there are well over a hundred of them and they don’t always have the expected effect. Some even hurt Isaac and if used in a tight spot are going to guarantee death. At the very least, they can be used in conjunction with other power ups and there’s not much of a limit on how many of them can be used at the same time. Still, there’s nothing worse than getting bad power-ups and items with no end in sight. At that point, it’s probably best to just quit and start again.There’s even some replayability to the title with extra characters that can be unlocked and a bit of exploring to see if there’s anything particularly useful in a given dungeon. The Binding of Isaac is a purposefully short title designed to be played many times over, not just due to its unforgiving nature, that will yield a surprise here and there when players think they’re seen everything. Its ability to keep you guessing is its greatest strength and weakness as it violently seesaws between an enjoyable 2D romp and unbridled frustration.The Binding of Isaac is not for those that are easily deterred, and it’s a safe bet that any Super Meat Boy fans are going to sink their teeth into it. For such a small title, there’s a lot of content packed into it and it’s an experience that isn’t always the same from one playthrough to the next. Players will question whether it was their own skill that carried them through to the end or if it was sheer luck, but regardless of the difficulty it’s an approachable game with a unique charm that boils blood just as easily as it encourages laughter at Isaac’s cartoonish spectacle of childhood trauma.A Must Play "

												Great game. I have a lot to say about it, and I think I should start with the bad stuff.*Has no support for resolutions bigger than 1280x900.*Controls are a bit annoyning - you can never put your mouse aside completely because you can't navigate through menus without it.*Can't take screenshots. Maybe it's just for me.*No GamePad support. Yes, I tried JoyToKey, and it doesn't work well.Those are all technical issues that I hope will be solved in Rebirth.NOW - the good stuff.Has so much to explore.Gameplay is amazingly fun. DLC adds a lot off good stuff.RANDOM! You never know what's next.I don't have much to say so just, PLAY IT.			"

												I have no problem whatsoever understanding why people love this game, but unfortunately, I'm not a particular fan of arcade shooters, rogue-like elements OR permadeath, so I was never going to be its greatest champion. The most I've managed so far is killing one boss and thereby progressing to a second level, and I'm just not ""hardcore"" enough to get much past that, I'm afraid.   So sure, I'm a big cry-baby who needs wimpy things like save-points to find a game truly worthwhile. But if you don't have any such failings, and don't mind an aesthetic as fresh and unique as the gameplay is retro and familiar, then you may well be one of the millions of people who swear by the genius of this product. I'm certainly a fan of Mr McMillen's sensibilities, even if I don't share his skillz in gaming.   A word to the wise, though: apparently subsequent, slightly retitled re-releases of this game are more technically finessed, and the consensus seems to be that this ISN'T the version to buy. So you might want to look into that before forking over your hard-earned dosh (mind you, if you just wanted to give it a quick test to see if it's ""you"", this version on sale may well be the ticket).   Normally I would only recommend a game like this to sickos and weirdos like my good self, but its epic sales figures suggest that the gaming world is comprised of nothing but. Who WOULDN'T love a game about a bawling baby who shoots tear-drops at bleeding-eyed monstrosities while dodging around small mountains of poop surrounded by flies? The world truly is a sad and beautiful place...Verdict: 8/10.			"

												Strange is a good word to describe the game overall but that's in the best sense of the word. A lot of fun if you like it's mixture of zelda like labyrinth layouts, SHMUP gameplay plus roguelike elements not to mention the interesting if macabre art direction.The myriad of combinations possible with all the different items you can find in each playthrough really make the game incredibly replayable and a blast to go through each playthrough trying to find new and better builds with Isaac and the other alternate characters that have various strengths and weaknesses relative to the eponymous hero.

												The Binding Of Isaac is an flash indie game developed by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl. The game’s storyline and name are both a reference to the Biblical story known also as Binding of Isaac. In the game, the player controls Isaac, a child that seeks safety in the basement after his mother is given a message of God commanding her to sacrifice her own son in order to proof her faith. In the basement Isaac starts going through dungeons located in the basement having to face his nightmares in form of monsters, in order to escape.    The style and game’s gameplay are inspired by Legend of Zelda series and similar to roguelike, where the rooms of all dungeons are randomly generated, being different each time you play, and this is what makes it so special because every gameplay is totally different. On each floor of the basement, the player must kill monsters in order to proceed to the next room. Along the way, it will be possible to collect keys weapons and power-ups which will increase your chance of surviving because each item has a special effect and you can also pick up coins which are used to buy items in shops spread all over each floor, but need a key to be opened.Each floor of the dungeon ends with a boss room, where a boss must be defeated in order to proceed to the next floor. Each time the bosses are different. At loading screens between floors, Isaac remembers scenarios, of his childhood while crying in fetal position, from rejection of his mother, unlucky moments and even bullying from his friends, some can even be Isaac’s own fears, but you’ll never know.The gameplay is easy to master since does not require very buttons and the soundtrack is not diverse, but it does fit very well the atmosphere of the game.One of the most awesome features of this game, in my opinion, and because due to flash limitation, it’s not possible to save, all your unlockables will stay unlocked and such, but you cannot save mid-game, so you will have to start over every time you go back to main menu, every time you lose and every time you close the game. And that is what makes it so hard and enjoyable since you will not get bored because every time all will be different and new!A DLC to the game was also released, “Wrath of the Lambs”, also a religious reference, and it adds all new content including new items, new rooms, new enemies, new bosses and its totally worth it!     This game has me craving for more every time I play it, the creativity of it is amazing and it will make you spend some good long hours playing it. I totally recommend you to get it.   ~ 9/10  P.s: Brace yourselfes, the remake is here!			"

												Only Steam would allow a game where you play as a naked cartoon child who must drown their enemies in a torrent of upgradeable tears, working your way through a questionably large basement until you can face and take down your disturbed Christian mother who seeks to purify you with her foot. And for that I love them, and the creators of said game.Just ... one more playthrough, and then I'll get back to work.			"

												This is not your average browser flash game: this is some kind of ""Dark souls"" for those stupid easy games.( and have+18 content)We embody Isaac, a normal guy who lives with his mother, they live happy with eachother until his mother starts to heard a ""voice from above"" demanding to sacrifice her own soon, Issac (trapped on his room) find a hatch to the basement, where the adventure begins.There 5 stages + final boss fightEvery single incoming stage increases enemies difficulty (as boss as well), and amount of rooms.The choices can decide your fate, altered by: deals with the devil, tarot cards and pills. You need to know what are they function, to use them effectively and in the right moment.The game is 100% replayable because is never the same on every playthrough, all is randomly generated:-rooms (including enemies, environments, and items to pick), -Boss stages.-Locations of special rooms (which leaves items and others to buy).good sountrack on special partsIt can take plenty of hours to complete :-Fill the vast item collection.-Find the""secrets"".-Unlock all the playable characters (all theirs with unique abylities)-Achieve all endings.

Nice art style, well-fitting soundtrack, addictive gameplay, very high replayability and surprisely deep and dark story of life and fears of Isaac makes you play it over and over again. It's challenging, but rewarding. Random-generated levels and tons of power-ups are not going to let the game bore you. Great indie masterpiece, highly recommended!			"

												The Binding of Isaac follows the bible story of the same name, as you play Isaac, a scared young lad escaping the religious tenacity of his mother. Binding of Isaac is one of my favourite games on Steam. It has huge, huge playability. If you get it, make sure you get the super-cheap DLC too, which essentially doubles the content of the game. It took me 100 hours to fully complete the game (Golden God) and even then I was missing one of the ""hard"" achievements.With the implementation of the DLC, there's tonnes of new content, bosses, items and trinkets to explore and discover. Amazing game for a super, super cheap price. So worth it. The humour is very dark and can be ""gross"", so if you're a little squeemish, you may wish to avoid!-Nilesy			"

												The Binding Of Isaac is a simple but fun indie game.You play as a young boy named Isaac who is forced to face the evil beings of his basement and further on. There are several stages, but to continue each floor, you have to beat a boss. The dungeons and rooms are randomly generated, so that each time you play everything is different. The creator did an amzing job with this point.There are several characters to unlock, by completing challenging objectives to play as them.Lots of items inhabit the dungeons going from a rail from pointless to very helpfull.This game is amazing without the dlc, with so much contect and area to explore each time you play.Few rooms contain slot machines, a devil, and many more.I find this game amazing for its price and would pick it up any day. An absolute well done to the team who made the game.I rate this game 9/10.			"

												At first glance, this game may seem simple; however, it's anything but.You start off with simple levels and enemies, collecting items that will help (or sometimes harm) you, getting you ready to fight progressively tougher enemies. Each time you go to the next level, you are met with different enemies, and all new opportunities to get items. And just when you think you've beat the game...you haven't. I'll let you figure out what that means. The items, enemies, rooms, and level layouts are completely random, so you will likely never have the same exact experience in this game twice. Unlocking new characters adds to the experience, as each one has its own benefits and setbacks, making the game easier in some ways and harder in others. Because of the overwhelming amount of items and enemies, I'd always recommend playing with the wiki for the game open, just so that you never make a bad decision when it comes to picking up items. Still, some things in this game come with a learning curve and you'll just have to find out what items you like to use and which ones will make you rage.It'll be frustrating at first, but once you unlock more items and beat your own personal records, you'll be addicted. Buying the Wrath of the Lamb DLC makes the game even tougher (so I suggest buying it after you have a good feel for the base game), but adds loads of new content, including enemies, items, levels, and more.Honestly, I'd recommend this game to anyone I knew, even with all of the dark humor and blasphemous jokes. When you look past all of that, it's a great game with excellent replay value.			"

Chock full of references to his other games such as Super Meat Boy, Gish, hell even his game titled *C*u*n*t* is referenced! Now let's move onto the replay value. At the time of writing this I have nearly 150 hours. Don't be surprised if you see 500 or something when you read this. Don't go into this game blind. Go watch youtube videos, streamers, etc. This game is extremely tough too, so if you want to buy the DLC with it I HIGHLY recommend beating the game a few times before you buy it. This game is just a true masterpiece with a ton of awesome bugs that makes it beautiful. The Binding of Isaac is possibly my favorite game of all time on Steam. That is all :)Edit: Some grammatical corrections, and eternal update was released, play without eternal first if you're a noob. Just scroll down in your library and then uncheck eternal edition and you should be set. That is all.			"

												The binding of isaac is one of those games that generate a huge WTF sensation when you first start playing it. You start off as Isaac, a kid whose christian mom decides to sacrifice to Jesus because of reasons, so you run off to your basement to avoid the imminent slaughter. However you soon find out that it is not safe there either, and pave your way to salvation by shooting random monsters with your tears as you progress through the basement's labyrinthine array of rooms. Several power-ups and mom's items (and pills) help you in this battle, while you unlock more of them as well as several other characters with different abilities as you progress in the game. Of course,  you have no idea what each item does when you pick it up and I personally found fun in discovering different items along the way. The binding of Isaac's unique dark humor and artwork have made it instantly recognisable and strangely lovable among other titles of its genre. However it is a difficult and unforgiving game that will send you to your death time an time again.+ Twisted -wtf- humor+ Loads of randomly generated items+ Cool soundtrack+ Great artwork- Can be really hard, especially with the wrath of lamb DLC "

												NOTE: This review is just to inform people who plan on buying this game now. TL;DR is: Dont buy it. This game is out of date by now, and worse yet its just too big for flash to handle. The game has moved over to Afterbirth, Which is the far smoother running, more expansive and currently supported replacement. If you were looking to get this instead, I recommend you don't because it most likely will run like crap.EDIT: Since it's evidentally not clear in my review, Afterbirth is not a sequal... it's an addon to the remake (rebirth) using something other than flash. Since flash couldn't handle the original. You will still get all the same story elements by playing afterbirth.  Afterbirth of course includes Rebirth which is the base game.			"

Your weapons are a child’s tears and globules of blood and pus, your enemies are flies the size of cats and toddlers, with their faces stuffed full of spiders. Human excrement litters the floor of almost every randomly generated room, sometimes trailing behind you as you flee from the floating, murderous heads of aborted fetuses.  But! It's AWESOME!And this is best game with re-playing ability ever!I'll recommend to anyone!			"

												Time to write a serious review (pfft serious) now that Valve added this review thing. Kay.So, I've always been the kind to really despise games where you win based off of luck and luck alone. And yet, this game does rely on luck, but not to the point where it's all you'll win based off of. A bit of skill is involved, in dodging shots and movement, knowing when to pick items, and when to ditch them. The game play is always randomized, so you never know what you're going to get unless you're using a seed in Spidermod. Anyhow, I'm gonna split this review into two main parts, and then extra things. Plot, gameplay, and then anything extra I'd like to add.Plot: The plot of this game is simple, yet it makes enough sense to be a plot. To keep it short, some little kid named Isaac's mother hears the voice of god, saying how corrupt with sin Isaac is, and eventually God tells his mother to kill Isaac in sacrifice. Simple, but pretty messed up. And in escape, Isaac jumps into the basement, unknowing of what's below. Overall, it's a plot, it makes sense, and it ties into the game. Yeah. I personally like how simple the plot is. Just my opinion.Gameplay: Now, for the gameplay, you're thrown into a randomly generated dungeon, and it plays top-down, similar to the Legend of Zelda for NES. You're armed with nothing more than your own tears at first, and have to cry your enemies to death. The controls are explained to you in the first room, with no tutorial, and you're off. Following the doors, you might find some room with a crown on it, known as a treasure room. You can gain items to become more powerful. For example, you might get more firerate on your tears, some laser you can fire instead of tears, you might upgrade your damage, or even your HP. Speaking of HP, when you first play, Isaac will start out with three hearts. On hit, your health goes down, obviously. Red hearts replenish health. However, you can earn blue hearts, and these blue hearts can go ABOVE your max health. However, once you lose them, these soul hearts, they're gone. Anyhow, throughout more exploration, you might find a dark, ominous-looking door. This is the boss room, where you fight the boss of the floor, and after it's defeated, you move on to the next floor. However, if you die, it's back to the beginning with you. A very true rogue-like game. I'll leave the rest for you to figure out, granted you purchase this game.Anything extra: The soundtrack. Nothing much more to say than it's amazing. Yeah. Also, this game is NOT for the weak of stomach, for there is a LOT of blood/gore.Final remarks: Overall, The Binding of Isaac is a VERY fun, and enjoyable game. Death happens a ton, and you're going to get used to it. The gameplay's fun, yet challenging, the plot's very...odd, but still good, and the soundtrack is just amazing.9.5/10. "

												The Binding of Isaac is a great game. It is very replayable and addictive, and the random elements make every run a little bit different. Wrath of the Lamb only expands on this, and makes the game even better than it was before. I would give it a positive rating...If not for Flash.Flash ruins this game. The performance is about as stable and reliable as a one-legged mountain goat, and the game is rife with bugs. The only graphical settings are the nondescript ""Low, Medium, High"", and the game is locked to a certain resolution. There is no controller support, and your progress gets wiped if you clear Flash memory. If you want to play Isaac, just wait for Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, a remake that not only gets rid of Flash but also expands on the game.			"

												17 hours of my life playing this simple frustrating game.Pros- Cheap, Rooms are random so, no 2 games are the same, you don't require huge specs to run this game. It's also very tiny in file size.Cons- Collectables don't say what they do so when you use them, they can be (usually are) wasted.It's handy to have a cheat sheet open in your browser that says what each item does.7/10EDIT: The trailer is messed up as ♥♥♥♥ - 11/10			"

												This is a game from older generation. There is no saves, no hints, no help. You must remember that gives each piece and how it interacts with others. Plus, it's very random, one game may be simple, the other incredibly difficult. But precisely this is the charm of the game. Challenge the player to deal with all its complexities.This is very good and captivating game. I will continue to play it until I collect all items)			"

												After little hours that i spend playing this game, i want to review The Binding Of IsaacStory:This is The Binding Of Isaac, where you play as boy who his name is Isaac and  he lives with his religiously Mother.One day his Mother received an order from God to kill Isaac where you gonna see it at the opening of the game. When his mother received the order from God, Isaac was locked out in his room, and Isaac sees her already preparing knife to kill Isaac. His mother kicked the Isaac door room. Isaac dont know what to do and underneath his carpet theres like a cave full of evil things where Isaac gonna escape from his mother, this is where the adventure starts. Gameplay:At first when i play, suddenly i get used to it (yeah because it was easy..). Im so addicted to this gane, even if im always losing, i just want to finish it again and again. After you defeat the boss, you get into the different cave and gonna defeat all the boss again, until you reach the main boss fight. To makes thing easy this game gives you like ability, unique items and power-ups! And make your own Isaac looks weird AF. Well i dont know what to say anymore, its just very good and addicting!Dont hesitate if you're buying this game or not, just buy it people! And its actually cheap for me especially when this game on sale, i got this when there's Hallowen Sale last year. It is worth it...			"

												Brutally good game, and I think the most difficult games. The game has a wide variety of laberints,opponents, gifts.When Isaac’s mother starts hearing the voice of God demanding a sacrifice be made to prove her faith, Isaac escapes into the basement facing droves of deranged enemies, lost brothers and sisters, his fears, and eventually his mother. The Binding of Isaac is a randomly generated action RPG shooter with heavy Rogue-like elements. Following Isaac on his journey players will find bizarre treasures that change Isaac’s form giving him super human abilities and enabling him to fight off droves of mysterious creatures, discover secrets and fight his way to safety. 8/10			"

												Use your tears to kill your mother and her heart, an unborn fetus version of yourself, and dead babies because apparently they are not dead enough already. You can't fool some of these dead babies when you kill them with tears, lasers, and 13th century explosives because they were not born yesterday. After you kill your mother, you can fight Satan or better yet kill yourself AND an undead version of yourself inside of a toy chest! You will spend hours searching inside poop to find pennies! Would definitely recommend to anyone that is not a Jew or a Christian fundamentalist, although Jews may find collecting pennies enjoyable.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is the quintessential roguelike dungeon-crawling shooter. The player will take control of Isaac, a crying naked young boy trying to escape the basement of his home. Isaacs mother, instructed by god to take his life as a test of faith, is the final boss in the game. Each level is a unique randomly generated dungeon, with 6 to 10 rooms and a boss fight. There are six playable characters that can be unlocked, and more than a hundred different items to discover and use during each random adventure. The gameplay is simple, consisting of dodging enemies attacks and firing Isaacs tears and dropping bombs as a means of offense. The game has a dark sort of humor about it, with each stage seeming to become more and more dangerous and depressing for little Isaac. The gameplay is solid, though the story is quite simple. There are no NPC's, no quests, and no real RPG-like qualities. It is a simple and entertaining romp with a high degree of difficulty, that requires a fair ammount of luck. Created by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl, The Binding of Isaac is beloved amongst fans of indie games and dungeon crawlers because of its pick-up-and-play nature and simple setup. For casual players, the game will find a place as a quick and easy shoot-em-up that passes time. Hardcore completionists will have plenty to work for, with a collection system that tracks every item the player has found and many varying and difficult achievements and characters to unlock. The game is single player only, and derives much of its value from the procedurally-generated levels and humorous yet difficult gameplay. If you'd like to see some gameplay, check out AGNBs Let's Play series. PROS: Easy to learn, fun to play, lots to discoverCONS: Very difficult, inherently repetitiveGRAPHICS: 3/5 - Originally a flash game, and it shows.SOUND: 5/5 - Perfectly fitting soundtrack and SFX.STORY: 3/5 - Not a lot in the story department, but not much is needed.GAMEPLAY: 5/5 - Highly addicting ""just one more try"" style gameplay.REPLAY VALUE: 5/5 - I find myself returning to it again and again. Great to play while drunk.OVERALL SCORE: 84/100 - A classic indie piece, well worth the $5. Even better if it's on sale.For more reviews by mowse, check out the mowse talks games Steam Community!

												This game is so utterly addictive. I don't know what it is, but the procedural generation of dungeons and items so different from each other that they actually change the gameplay is what makes this game unique.Brought to you by the creators of Super Meat Boy and a personal favorite Aether (check it out if you don't know it), this game is an arcade-like dungeon-exploring with progression based on repetition. Some may hate the fact that you need to kill the first boss about eight times to unlock the second boss, and you need to kill the second main boss some times to unlock the third boss, and so on.Personally I don't mind that sort of thing, specially due to the random factor that affects the items you get. A lot is based on LUCK, since there are items that are far above others in quality and power, but overall the game is very balanced and you can get a kick out of it no matter the hand you are dealt.System of achievements, items and challenges is what marks the progression of this game, besides the number of times you defeated the bosses. Each challenge is unique and sets you with a made up combo of items (or no item at all), and it is a great thing to have for end-game players.Overall, this game is one of my favorites of all time, and I couldn't be more excited for the release of the reboot, Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. DEFINETELLY worth to check it out, and you are garanteed your money's worth.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a game about a young child, whose devout christian mother tries to kill him. He escapes into the basement through a trapdoor, and then must navigate through the dungeon that is the Basement. It is a 2D Top-down dungeon crawler, where you can play one of several characters. You start out in Isaac's Mothers Basement working your way throughout. The game is strange, but funny and interesting. It feels a lot like The original Legend of Zelda, though most dungeon crawlers do, and it also features co-op play so you can play with friends. I recommend this game if you enjoy adventuring through dungeons! The Binding of Isaac Rebirth is also a fun play if you want to try other games in the series.			"

												This game is basically a masterpiece and a major success in the realm of randomly-generated games.  I found it quite fun to follow the storyline, and am honestly beginning to wonder who Isaac's dad was, and how he plays into the game. :oPros:- smooth, increasingly simple gameplay- AWESOME soundtrack (Cheers to Danny Baronowsky)- A near infinite variety of how the game could play out- Bosses that actually increase in difficulty and pose quite the challenge (unlike some of today's more modern games)- a challenge in terms of preparing and strategizing, depending on the items you have- There are a few references to other games within it.  (SMB, The Legend of Zelda, for instance)Cons:- It can get quite laggy if there are a lot of things happening at once- It's hard to talk to people while you're in-game, as the fullscreen feature doesn't allow the shift-tab combo to access the community, so you'd have to have it windowed most of the time if you want to talk to peopleThat's all. :3  I DEFINITELY recommend this game. :D			"

												Fantastic new school version of old school games like Zelda 1 mixed with Smash TV. The gameplay is pretty simple. a 3/4ths top down shooter that allows you to shoot in 4 directions. There are also alternate power ups and bombs to use. Really simple controls like Smash TV mixed with Zelda. You are Isaac, stuck in a multi leveled dungeon. Each one of these dungeon levels is in the old Zelda 1 style where each room is 1 screen. The dungeons / basements are randomized, every room and enemy combination is randomly generating. The gameplay is fun and addictive. The only downside is no lives, no continues. There are tons of quirky weapons, enemies, power ups and bosses. Everyone should spend the $5 to play this game.I can understand if its not for everyone, because it is an arcadey retro Zelda 1 meets Smash TV sort of game. The graphics are cute and charming, but portray horrifying things like if you were to ever see a doodle of a fetus or a doodle of someone coughing out flies and poop staining the floor. Like a sad disparagingly sort of awesome. You play as Issac who basically has to get out of randomized Zelda style dungeons. There are dozens of unique enemies with different attack styles. Few enemies seem to have predictable patterns. There are also plenty of boss battles.The controls take some getting used to, but they are basically Smash TV controls. You use your directional pad, then you use an attack direction. So you can move right and shoot left or up, or down or right. You have a bomb button, a special findable item and an auxiliary power up button for things like pills. The main attack are bullets... which are really tears. Bombs sit, but you can push them, pills do good and bad things. Some items / power ups give you dolls for extra weapons, or a dead cat gives you 9 lives but the catch is you have 1 heart energy per life. You can also get metal hearts, that count as energy, but once they're gone you can't get them back like normal heart healths.You play through 'basement' floor after floor marked with a boss at the end. You find keys, bomb walls, kill enemies, gamble, visit stores, danger rooms and so on. Just like Zelda 1. The only thing is that it is all randomized. The room layouts are randomized, the rooms themselves are randomized, the stores, the weapons, the items.It is all randomized, so you'll never play the same game twice. This isn't a story based game, so it won't appeal to everyone. Its highly entertaining especially in short bursts of play. For that price, you can't miss this game.I highly recommend the game for its gameplay, cheap price and its never the same game twice with the random dungeons.			"

												English:After 108 hours I finally 100% completed The Binding of Isaac + Wrath of the Lamb expansion (all 84 achievements).The amount of hours you can put into it until you don't have nothing else to do is simply incredible given the price you can pay for the pack with the game and expansion (0.99 on a sale).If you never played the game before expect to finish it completely in 150-200+ hours (depending on your skill in this kind of game).For new players the game will probably be kinda difficult and even more with the expansion content so i would recommend playing without it installed (under DLC tab in game properties) at least until you have unlocked It Lives or beaten Sheol once.After that you'll be able to handle most of the new enemies and bosses, and you will appreciate the addition of trinkets and new items.There are several drawbacks with the expansion. Mostly glitches that it introduces such as enemies glitching through some corners, not properly working Brimstone controls, etc. but with all the new game elements you can easily forget about this.PS. Gorgeous soundtrack if you don't know it yet.Español:Despues de 108 horas al fin he completado al 100% The Binding of Isaac + la expansion Wrath of the Lamb (los 84 logros).La cantidad de horas que puedes echarle hasta que no tienes nada mas que hacer es simplemente increible dado el precio por el que puedes comprar el pack con el juego y la expansion (0.99 rebajado).Si nunca has jugado al juego puedes esperar acabarlo completamente en mas de 150-200 horas (dependiendo de tu habilidad en este tipo de juego).A los nuevos jugadores probablemente les resulte dificil y mas aun con el contenido de la expansion, asi que recomendaria jugar sin ella instalada (en la pestaña DLC de las propiedades del juego) al menos hasta que hayas desbloqueado It Lives o superado Sheol una vez. Despues de eso estaras preparado para los nuevos enemigos y jefes, y apreciaras mas los nuevos objetos y los trinkets.La expansion tiene algunos inconvenientes como glitches que introduce del tipo enemigos que traspasan algunas esquinas, los controles del objeto Brimstone no funcionan muy bien, etc. pero con la cantidad de nuevos elementos en el juego uno se puede olvidar perfectamente de esto.PD. Si todavia no lo sabes la banda sonora es impresionante.			"

												Binding of Isaac is one of the best games I've played on Steam. It has the right level of difficulty, an interesting base story, and a lot of secrets to uncover. Being able to play as a bunch of different characters, all with different stats and starting items, and random items every time you play through the game, makes the game extremely fun and random. Some runs will work, some won't and a lot does depend on luck, but even in a run where you haven't been particularly lucky you still have a chance to pull it off if you fit in a bit of skill.This is one of the first games I played on Steam, and I didn't really enjoy it at first. I sucked at it, and couldn't even get to the first Mom fight. Eventually though, as I played the game more, I got better and learned how to deal with the various enemies. I learned advantages and disadvantages of picking up certain items, and which items were OP so I could hope for one of those. The wiki really helped a lot at the beginning to help me learn the items, of which there are over 100 each with different effects.Though I believe it's intentional for some characters to be more difficult to play than others, it's not a feature I can fully appreciate. I like when all the characters in a game are balanced, which could have been very possible in BoI but some characters are still distinctly worse than others.This game also takes a long while to get the hang of. At first, I played about 2 hours of this game then quit and didn't play again for almost a year. I was then reintroduced to the game, and I started playing it a lot more. It still took me another long time (maybe 40-50 hours) to beat mom for the first time, and then 100 more hours on top of that to beat ??? at the end of the game. It takes practice and patience to finally beat the game, but it's worth every minute of it.The DLC for this game is definitely required. Wrath of the Lamb adds so much important content and it's not nearly as fun without it. There are significantly fewer items, less end-game content, less enemies, and a lot less fun to be had. Although, with or without the DLC, Binding of Isaac is easily worth the price you pay for it at any time. $8 is nothing compared to the amount of fun you will have playing this game.			"

I would argue it is one of the best games of all time. With its high difficulty, enemy variance, different items, and characters, it is infinitely replayable. The different ways you change your play style according to which character you are playing, which items you pick up, or which type of room you walk into always keep gameplay fresh. I strongly recommend buying The Binding of Isaac. It is too good to miss.			"

												Eerie atmosphere, insane item combinations that can make or break a run, difficulty is potentially brutally challenging, absurd amounts of replayability, and JUST the right amount of sacrilege. MORE than worth the $8 for it and Wrath of the Lamb, and I'm practically drooling over the upcoming Rebirth.I don't care who you are, you need this game in your life.			"

												Long version:Ok, so this is a great psychological thriller revolving around fears of a child growing up in a dysfunctional family, being raised by a mother with paranoid schizophrenia, who is experiencing imperative auditory hallucinations which are rigidly and delusionally interpreted and provoke verbal and behavioral responses including obdience. Delusional interpretation manifests in, among others, grandiosity, feeling of a mission, delusions of guilt and sin (the latter being transferred to her child). These result in inappropriate and irresponsible actions which jeopardize the safety of her son, Isaac.Isaac, trying to cope with the family situation, is facing his worst childhood subconscious fears. Subconsciousness is traditionally represented as 'basement' (similarly to e.g. Hitchcock's Psycho). His weapon in fighting those fears is crying and thus, relieving negative emotions. As Isaac goes deeper into the subconscious cleansing himself in a psychoanalytical way, he discovers his most concealed desire - to kill his mom. Short version:It's the only game that your wife will encourage you to play.			"

												I would heartily recommend The Binding of Isaac to anyone who isn't too squeamish. While the artstyle is very cartoony it still has some disturbing imagery and grotesque designs. That being said, this childlike portayal of such menacing sights offers a very interesting visual presentation for the game.The proof, however, lies in the playing. This begs the question of how well The Binding of Isaac's gameplay holds up. For being such a simple idea initially to shoot baddies while avoiding being shot yourself a surprising amount of complexity is added with its varied item combinations. One game session you may find yourself becoming a flying demon spitting unforgiving lasers from hell, while in the next you may be stuck peeing on enemies as your only form of self defence. The game also does an okay job of ramping up the difficulty as the player progresses.In conclusion, give this game a spin if you can spare the money and you can handle its graphical style. You may also want to consider picking up the expansion Wrath of the Lamb, it makes it even better.			"

												Hmm, where should I begin.At first I was quite sceptical, to be honest, towards this game. Running around naked in a maze, collecting mushrooms and syringes, killing flies and spiders. Sounds fuun~~*sarcasm*. NAH-AH mothafacka. Those who think it's 'easy' obviously haven't played it.  It's not repetitive in any way, which I value in an indie/rogue-like games and it's incredibly satisfying to beat the game. Especially for the very first time. Just. Trust me. There is just so much in this game, secrets, treasures, that it's a bit over-whelming. It's like: you think you know a lot about the game (leave alone 'know everything about the game'), but I can almost guarantee that you don't.Oh and it's based mostly around religious stuff and God and Satan and a bit more Satan. Did I mention there's a lot of satanic  things? And Devil + Satan <3All in all, it's one of the funniest, weirdest rogue-like games I have ever played, hands down. Definitely worth every hour I have poured into it. Can't wait what 'Binding of Isaac: Rebirth' has to offer with the whole Co-Op function added to it :3Lastly: There are rare golden piles of crap in the game. Just how awesome is that??!			"

												A simple game with tremendous depth (somehow). You never get tired of finding out what new combination of powerups, trinkets, and items will allow you to... completely fail to escape The Basement.The most rewarding thing I got out of this game is the realization that I really suck at roguelikes and should probably avoid them entirely. I can't thank Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl enough for that. It's just been too long since Temple of Apshai on the C64, and I need to give it a rest.Everyone else will no doubt love Isaac, and I heartily recommended it to them. I'll just stick with easy games like Borderlands and Osmos, and trust that the rest of you can save this little guy, however many times it takes you to 100% the game.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is an arena style, action-adventure game where it follows the main protagonist, Isaac through the depths of his basement and unknown to escape his insane murderous mother after she receives a sacrifice demand from God. It has an interesting story that is based on events in the Christian religion. This being said, there are many other references such as item names and bosses (Scapular item and Satan boss). You start out with playing Isaac (other characters can be unlocked) battling through six floors until you finally meet and battle your own mother. Additional floors are unlocked with a DLC. The DLC is vital if you want to understand and truly enjoy this game. It unlocks an additional five rooms, all filled with new enemies, new items, and new forms of dark humor, and allows you to generate many more endings, featuring an epic battle against Satan and Isaac himself portraying as a disciple of God.

YouTube™ Video: 60 Second Reviews: Binding of Isaac 

			Views: 2,782		

			Binding of Isaac is an RPG Shooter which will have you crawling around randomly generated dungeons collecting items and killing bosses.		

Binding of Isaac may seem like a really simple top down RPG shooter, but trust me when I say that's just a front. If you can look past the cartoonish art style and simplistic look then you'll see a really expansive game with tonnes to find and do.Now first things first: this game is hard. You will spend a lot of your time dying, dying and dying again. If you're gonna whine about a difficult unforgiving game, then don't get this. When you die, that's game over. You start again at the beginning with nothing.Along your journey you'll find a total over 235 items which upgrade your character. I'd say this is what actually makes the game shine, all the items are randomized so every time you play through it, you'll get different items which change how you play. A really nice touch is that the items also change your character's appearance, which is a visually pleasing change.One issue I have with this is that there's usually no indication as to what the items actually do. Unless you have a wiki open whilst you're playing, you're gonna have a bad time. It would have been nice if they at least included an in-game encyclopaedia.Because all the items are randomized, a lot of this game is down to luck which decides whether or not you actually have a successful game which kinda sucks. Overall, considering it's really cheap and a fun game, it gets a 6 out of 10 so pick it up if you have the money!			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a good way to waste time. Each level is randomly generated and death is permanent; you never know what's in store for you when you start it up. Though dying sucks, you'll still likely feel a sense of achievement as you go deeper into the story and unlock more content. I highly recommend having the wiki open while playing, as there are a ton of items with different and obscure effects. I'd also like to suggest playing the base game for a bit before activating the Wrath of the Lamb DLC. It's a fun and compelling game that's just hard enough to make you want to give it another shot, over and over again. Once you've completed some achievements, you can even change youre starting character. The soundtrack is astounding and the enemies are creative. 10/10Because ""The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth"" is coming out soon, it's probably wise to wait and see if that's any good before buying this. It's supposed to have a lot of new features. The fact that Rebirth exists doesn't make this game any less good but if you can only buy one, you should know you're getting the best.			"

												One of the absolute most brilliant releases of the 21st century. Binding of isaac tells a horrific story with a multitude of disturbing elements that leave you wondering what the designer was thinking when he made this, but whatever he did, it's done in such a way that it gets to people in the best way possibleBinding of isaac is an exploration based adventure with an extremely well thought out progression system, numerous random elements and all that other goodness. The core gameplay can be summed up as ""easy to learn, hard to master"" and the Wrath of the Lamb DLC once again proves this to be a solid statement.Currently the remake is in progress, but this is what started it, and this is what set the standards for similar games in it's genre. Hardcore roguelike elements and a variety of wacky and impressive in game items provide a fresh experience for a loooong time, with a permadeath mechanic that leaves you on the tip of your chair and wanting more and more each time.To sum up this gem of a game, it's now on sale for an all time low. Less than 2 bucks gets you this beauty of a game and the expansion, but in the end it's priceless.No one will regret picking this up. From the die hards to the softcores, there's a place for everyone in the basement >:)			"

												This game is awesome, awesome, and more awesome and my grilfriend love it too!The Binding of Isaac looks like an old school game like Zelda, but with a very dark scenario and very dark humor.You are Isaac, a naked boy in cellars under his house. His mother want to kill him. You play level after level in a randomly generated dungeon. You are fighting against Monsters and at the end of each level against a random boss.You can collect items which makes you stronger, better or gives you other specials.There are multiple playable characters and endings in the game. The WASD keys are used for movement, with shooting assigned to either the arrow keys or your mouse.I try to play it with X-Box Controller 360, but it does not work. The game does not officially support this setup, it advertises you to download a third-party piece of software. Thats complicated and sucks (The only bad thing in this game). But it does not matter, the game is cool.			"

												This game's brilliant.I wanted to try it for a long while thinking it would be a decent game when I actually played it. Needless to say I'm really glad I bought this. This game has it all.It's a rogue-like so it's very challenging and has randomly generated levels, which gives this game high replayablility! Good visuals, awesome music, and great gameplay! It also has a very dark and deppresing mood which fits this game extremely well! It has a a bunch of achievments to get. Has a good amount of unlockable characters. Lots of items and powerups to get. Various enemies that'll try to greet Isaac and friends to their untimley demise. It has fun boss battles. It has a simple and easily understandable story (Which is a good thing and a bad thing). It also has DLC that adds a bunch to the game that's only $3. ALL of the complaints and problems I have with this game are very minor and are instantly stomped on by all of the good things in this game!$5 is a very generous price for a great game like this! It is definetly worth checking out and I highly recommend it!			"

												To save your time I am going to start with a TL;DR in a form of a pros/cons list:Pros:+ Endless replayablity+ Easy to master controls+ Unique design+ Huge item pool+ Nice soundtrack+ There is a DLC available which makes the game even more awesome, adding more items, enemies, game mods etc.Cons:- Quite sluggish sometimes due to the Flash limitations- Might be insanely hard if you get unlucky with the items drop- Could use a built-in manual for the items (I am using this[bindingofisaac.wikia.com] Wikia page as a reference)- VERY addictive.- Sometimes achievements doesn't work out of the box (I am using the 2nd FIX featured here)You navigate your character through a series of randomly generated dungeons, each divided into ""floors"". Each ""floor"" is essencialy a number of ""rooms"", most of which contain various monsters. In order to progress to the next ""floor"", you need to defeat a boss.The character can carry a set of items, some of which are passive, some are activated and some are single-use power-ups.There are also unlockable characters each with unique gameplay style.The story develops as you complete the game numerous times and is pretty much wowen of the Bible references and allusionsThis game is great in terms of value-for-money ratio. Almost endless replayability turns achievements like ""Complete the whole game 9 times"" from a nightmarish grind into a funfest. Well maybe not a funfest, cosidering the fact that sometimes the almighty random makes it really hard to finish your run - you progression is highly item-dependent and all item drops are entirely random.The game features a good soundtrack (which may get a bit old after a few dozens of playthroughs), outstanding and recognizable character design and over a hundred collectible items - some of which interact with each other creating either a deadly combo that will annihilate your enemies or a rather wonky skillset that will hinder your further progression in the current run.Controls and battle system are intuitive - you will get the ropes few moments into the game. The only thing you might find yourself lost at is the huge pool of items - especially considering the fact that not all of them are provided with a full description.So to sum up - this game is a great bang for a buck. I was not sure if I should buy it at first, but I have no regrets now that I bought it. Recommended!			"

												After playing 8 hours I finally finished the game for the first time. It's pretty hard to complete if you can't find good set of items.The Binding of Isaac is a game for people with sick sense of humor and patience. Defeat 7 sins, make deals with the devil, kill your own mother.Personally I don't like roguelike games but this one is totally different. I clearly understand why it's so popular.Game has one flaw: poor optimalization, even on Intel Quad core, GTX760 there are moments when it starts  to work very sloooooow.			"

												Personal Rating: 8/10I haven't played much of this game and I can't say I will, but it's good. I got it on sale for 49p with all the DLC and what I got was truly amazing. I'm going to go out on a limb here, I don't like platformers, adventure games or dungeon crawlers. This is an adventure, dungeon crawler type game so we're off to a lovely start. I think the reason I like this game the most is the soundtrack, which is absolutely fantastic and I can listen to it on Steam Music. It's also creepy as hell, I mean, I attacked some sort of uterus with a face attached to it, I killed the behemoth thing and was confronted by a flying face.Every playthrough is different, I learnt that the hard way, thinking that it was safe to go into that room when in fact it was full of mutant Isaac's. If you can get this game cheap then you'll enjoy it, not too keen on the story, seems a little meh to be honest, but who needs a story when your game is this ♥♥♥♥ing creepy?			"

												+ This game is filled to the brim with content. It'll take even the best at least 50h+ to complete everything. And I'm talking about the BEST here! I'm at god knows how many hours and I still haven't fully completed it.+ Spooky+ Endlessly replayable because of the randomized nature and the ""one more try effect"" seen in games such as Civ.+ Secrets!+ The sound design fits the game perfectly. You'll be humming these tunes for YEARS.+ Charming, childhood gone wrong aesthetics (the creepy drawings children like to make in every clichéd horror movie/game/whatever)+ Tons of unlockables, challenges, etc. + 2spooky+ Harder than my boner this game gives me (and it's rock solid).+ Best bang for your buck EVER (probably).+ 3spookyRebirth's way better though.

												What can really be said about The Binding of Isaac at this point that hasn't already been said? A devilish little roguelike wrapped up in a highly-interpretive commentary on relgion and religious iconography with a lot of inspiration from The Legend of Zelda and Robotron/Smash TV style gameplay. The sheer variety of items to find and combine and the massive amount of enemy types and bosses you'll come across make the game's super low price for entry seem almost insane, and even when the game starts asking for multiple playthroughs to finally see the ""true end"" it somehow still keeps tossing new things at you to fight and play with. That said, I don't feel that the game is immediately rewarding and doesn't always make the best of first impressions. The artstyle may not be your thing, the four-way firing mechanics and low rate of fire can make it difficult to really get started, and the heavy reliance on random elements won't always gel with everyone, especially when the game spawns rooms where not taking damage is impossible. It can take a while for The Binding of Isaac to really grab you, and for some it may just never happen. If it does manage to grab you though, you're in for an almost endlessly replayable little treat that just keeps giving and giving. It's also highly recommended that you get as much as you want or can out of the vanilla game before investing in the DLC.			"

												Running around in mom's heels and swinging her bra around your head is the first step towards adolescence, kids.Now, take off your clothes and go play.As much as I strongly dislike this game, (mainly because I suck at it) it is addictive. (I actually prefer to watch other people play on my friends list and cry silently that I'll never earn those achieves.)There appear to be about a million levels of this basement-initiated labyrinth, of which you fight the spawn of the Devil until you meet Devils-incarnate herself: your Mother... ...Then it dawns on you that technically you're still related despite her bloodthirsty rampage earlier, which makes YOU involved in this somehow - perhaps even accountable in some terrible way, and just what the heck has been going on under your house all these years? and further still, after all of that, you've been fighting evil with tears the size of bathtubs and may need to see an Optometrist.Isaac is a very disturbed child.

												An incredibly fun, Zelda-like, dungeon crawler with art by the always amazing Edmund McMillen, and programming by Florian Himsl. You play as Isaac, a young boy who is being hunted by his mother, who is on a mission from ""God"" to sacrifice Isaac. You travel through a series of randomly-generated basements and caves, collecting a huge variety of power-ups on your way. The religious themes in Binding are a breath of fresh air, providing some provoking, yet subtle storytelling as you play. The soundtrack as composed by Danny Baranowsky, who had collaborated previously with Edmund McMillen on the critically-acclaimed platformer, Super Meat Boy. Baranowsky created an amazing, metal soundtrack with a few ambient tracks as well. All the music fits the gameplay perfectly. With a huge replay-value and quirky yet creepy environment, there's no way I can't recommend this game, especially at the low price of $4.99.			"

												What can I say about the Binding of Isaac...It is probably the most frustrated I have ever been at a game, yet I love it all the same. Every run is different, and you could die in the first level, or beat the last boss, dependent partially on your skill and partially on your luck. You never know what you're going to get going into this game. With massive replayability, this is probably the best $5 I have ever spent. The game will slow down every once in a while, as it runs on Flash, but this is usually not too much of a problem.Also, it features absolutely amazing music.If you enjoy rogue-likes, I would seriously recommend giving this game a try.

												The Binding of Isaac is a bit of an oddity for me to review. First let me explain the game. You play a character who shoots enemies in his basement with his tears. The levels consist of several interconnected rooms, through which you generally fight a group of gruesome bad guys (zombies, mutant spiders, etc.). You fight through enough of them to get keys or coins, which allow you to open up rooms with upgrades or to buy upgrades. Each floor has a boss fight, after which you'll drop down to the next floor, then repeat the process. Now let me talk about the difficulty. You will quickly find this game does not mess around. You start off with three hearts. Each hit takes away half a heart; six hits and you're dead. If you die, you go back to the beginning of the game (absolutely no saves). On top of that, you often face multiple enemies who can move faster than you and can shoot projectiles. You also have extremely little recovery time with each hit. You'll need to explore every room to hopefully find powerups or money so you can pay for a little bit of health. Don't expect to find much health throughout each stage, except after bosses. This is easily one of the most difficult games that I've actually still managed to have fun with. Yes, it is frustrating at times, but it never seems unfair. The game plays by a certain set of rules and will always abide by them. There's a certain amount of comfort in knowing that. The enemies on the other hand, they range from mildly annoying to downright evil. But you'll see that for yourself if you buy this game.The game's aesthetic design is great, the music is great, and the story, while macabre, is pretty interesting. The control is very good and the game is consistent in its dark atmosphere that some would call over-the-top dark humor. The art and level design are, for the most part, pretty simple, but that's okay. The game comes off as cartoony, but I think that contributes to the over-the-top gothic feel. Artistically speaking, it kinds of runs in a similar vein as Salad Fingers.While the Binding of Isaac is repetitive, there's actually a lot of variety. The game mixes up the bosses, each room is randomly generated with random enemies and random items, and there are a TON of different powerups. While it should feel like you're going through the motions again and again, for some reason it doesn't. The story isn't anything deep, of course, and any semblance of an actual plot is non-existent. You play through a floor, then drop down to the next; wash, rinse, and repeat. It's very similar to Diablo in that fashion. Some people may like that and that's fine, but just know that that's what this game is. While this seemingly meaningless trek initially irked me, I've gotten used to it and now I see the game for what it is. It's not really trying to be something it's not, and as far as original arcade shooters go, this one is probably the best I've ever played. The no-save feature is necessary, I now feel, because it encourages retrying and retrying. It builds skill. The random nature of the game is definitely a plus because you never play through the game with the exact map and enemy placement twice. The game's large amount of variety ensures the game has high replay value.I've gone back and forth on my opinions with this game. Originally I had mixed feelings because some of the less conventional aspects didn't jibe with my personal preference. However, it is strangely addicting and fun. The difficulty spikes at the fifth floor and gets to (in my opinion) near-impossible levels without mastery. At the moment, the price point ($4.99 for the base game, $2.99 for the DLC) is very good. It's a fun time-waster, especially if you've got a dark sense of humor. Even though I'm not really a fan of arcade shooters, this one sucked me in, and I can't really explain it. As I said before, the art design, music, and controls are all very good, and while the game gets incredibly difficult, it always seems fair. Most importantly, The Binding of Isaac doesn't claim to be something it's not, so it's important to see it for what it is. I've gone back on my mixed feelings and now say that I do recommend this one if you have a dark sense of humor and/or enjoy difficult games.			"

												One of the best flash player-based games i've ever seen. You can spend hours and days playing this game and it will not bother you, because every time you press ""new game"" - it will always be a random playthrough. A perfect time-killer. Edmund McMillen is a genius. Only one thing that disturbs you during the game - is lags and freezes  even on good PC's. Highly recommend this game.			"

												If you like a challenge this is the game for you. I have fully completed this game and I must say it can be pretty rage inducing at some points and luck determines a main part of how the game goes, but to win you do need to try pretty hard yourself too and overal the game is pretty balanced. If you buy the game you should buy the Wrath of the Lamb DLC with it since it is really worth it. It includes more items and bosses. There is a remake of the game called The binding of Isaac: Rebirth (And Afterbirth DLC) and if you like this game I would also recommend Rebirth since it's mostly the same game but with even more horrors and challenges. This game does have one major addition called hard mode/ ethernal mode which adds even harder bosses and harder variations on existing monsters.In conclusion, the game is pretty hard and if you like a chalenge you should consider buying this game especially if its on sale.

												Highly Addicting Rogue-Like with a cute gruesome storyI would like to point out a few personal criticisms though- All items, rooms, and abilites in the game do not have a description or any information on what they do or used for, there are TONS of different unique items with unique abilities so..you have to pause the game and go look at a Wiki for info (IMO, this is bad game design and is also something I hate about Minecraft)- It's a Rogue-like with VERY RANDOM elements that cause you to fail 9 out of 10 times, and sometimes feels unfair. For instance sometimes you start a run, and you will come across a golden chest, but you can't get to the chest without a bomb, and you can't unlock the chest without a key, and more often than not there won't be any bomb or key pickups on the floor so you are unable to get the chest. (same applies to opening doors, secret rooms, etc.)- As with the previous note abilities are also randomized, so sometimes you can go an entire game without seeing a single dmg + abilitiy making the game feel unfairOther than its a great game that everyone should experience. I know I probably should say more good things about the game, but there's already 99999 positive reviews on the game, so instead I focused on what I didn't like and what I think would make the game better. (criticism = improvements in later games)			"

												Binding of Isaac creator Edmund McMillen who has worked on other indie games like super meat boy. At first glance you will be questioning getting it but is one of the best indie games I have played. The game is a rouge like with hundreds of items to bump into on the way as you go through room after room, floor after floor killing and defeating bosses along the way. WIth 10 different endings that will increase the difficulty each time you beat one and with different alternate endings after increases the play time value giantly. The game does look very dark on the elements but is a great game with refrences to other games Edmund McMillen as made. I would rate this 10/10 with charcters, mulitple endings, hundred of items you will not find that you have done everything and with each room you go into random everytime you will enjoy your time with this game £4.99 well spent. PS a remade version will be comming out early 2014 with new features and better quality ingame.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a fun, cheap and extremly fun game, with a lot of replayability and almost infinite item combinations that make the game even funnier.The game is incredibly hard when you start playing it but once you get a hang of it you won't want to stop, just like McMillen's Super Meat Boy. In the same way as meat boy, Binding of Isaac also has an flawless sountrack composed by Danny B. with kudos to boss themes.The only ""bad"" aspect of the game i can think is that when you die you have to start all over again, which can get frustrating after a while, but what is a good game without it's difficulty?Overall 10/10			"

												Much like the other offerings from Edmund McMillen, The Binding of Isaac is not for the faint of heart or those who are easily discouraged, frustrated, or require a constant, guiding hand to have a good time. The Binding of Isaac will kill you, a lot, over and over, without mercy. However, the genius of its game design beckons to a bygone era where reward and punishment come purely from reflexes, understanding the game mechanics, how enemies move and fight, and a proper utilization of the tools at hand. Because of this design philosophy, Isaac will demand that you play again and again, slowly honing your skill and understanding until you no longer feel small and defenseless. The game can seem impossibly difficult upon first sitting, yet once the wisdom of time accumulates those impossible bosses will suddenly seem like easy prey compared to the horrors you now contend with on the deeper levels.Mechanically, Isaac suffers slightly from its roots as a Flash based game, denying us some of the features and options we have come to expect even from an indie game. However, the gameplay is still brilliant enough to warrant attention and the gameplay is often spot on. Isaac catches and keeps attention with a reliance on perma-death and random pick-ups which can drastically alter how the game is played. One moment you are shooting ineffective tears at enemies, the next you are firing screen extending lasers, the next you are soaring over pits and obstructions with angelic wings. There is enough constant variety available in every play through to keep the game refreshing even on the three-hundredth run, compounded by the introduction of new bosses, deeper levels, new playable characters, and more powerful and interesting bonuses unlocked upon your continued successes.Beyond the addictive gameplay, McMillen has crafted an art style which is often both beautiful and disturbing. The cartoony characterizations mask the devious implications of many of the enemies and items as well as softening the harsh blows presented by the sheer constant brutality of your actions. There is something about Isaac that gets into your head, a fact not discounted by the catchy, haunting music constantly calling you ever further into the abyss. It is not unreasonable to say that Isaac is not a game you can pick up over a weekend, beat, and then forget; on the contrary it will call to you in the waking world, offering one more game, one more chance to redeem all your failed attempts, one more opportunity to immerse yourself in its twisted, witty, and beautiful world.

												This game is in terms of looks fairly simple, but don't let that fool you. Binding of Isaac will occupy your time and keep you amused for hours if you let it. The games randomizer can be quite frustrating at times, but occassionally you get the perfect run and while you spent some time getting there you will unlock tons and tons of new items and features, which brings something new to the table for every new game you play.This game is for someone who enjoy shoot-em-ups but also enjoy classic platformers such as some retro games as it has a nice element of dungeon-crawl.

												The Binding of Isaac is a superb rougelike game featureing over 200 items and 50+ monsters the replayablity is endless.I personally think that if you going to buy this game and you are clueless of what this game is, you should figure it out for yourself rather than watching a Let's play or any sort of walktrough of it.And why you may ask?Because one of the biggest strong points about this game is learning what everything does and what should bosses and enemies you should be thirlled from.Altrough this game is pretty modern game it is more based on retro games and the diffuclty curve is alot bigger then other exsisting game which adds to the fun of this gameOver the top you have the awesome looking artstyle and the amazingly fitting religious soundtrack made by Danny B. which made also the soundtrack for another one of Edmund Mcmillen games Super Meat BoyI find that the weakset point of this game is the fact it runs on flash and it means it very limited by performance and on rooms with alot of enemies and particle effects the game may run poorly even on high-end machines.I think that in this 5$ price point, and it is a must have for any type of gamer.Not convinced yet?Go to Newgrounds and try the demo for yourself!

												This game is a complete surprise.  The graphics are minimalistic, the sounds are average, and the gameplay quite retro zelda like.  But for some reason, because it's a short game that can only take you 30 minutes to beat in one playthrough it's not about the one playthrough.  Each time through you will find different random upgrades or weapons, different monsters, different bosses and of course different loot.  This is by no means an easy game.  Might get frustrating, but for some reason I keep coming back to it.  This game is fun!			"

												This game is truthfully amazing. I spent some time on it, I wish I could spend some more, and I figured it was worth every digital penny. There are a large amount of items, with the levels changing every time you play, making it never the same game every time you play it.Pros- +Very good price for such a fun game+Soundtracks are amazing+Difficult, but not impossible+Large variety of levels+Large variety of items+DLC, Wrath of the Lamb adds such a large amount, it's almost like a different game- And in a good way.+Looks like a classic browser game, and not a hugely computer intensive game+VERY small download, meaning it should take you less than a good minute (With bad internet) to download+Not very computer intenseCons--Music volume I found could not be changed, only disabled or enabled-Satanic references, but if anything has religion references in it there is bound to be something Anti within itAll in all, this game is worth your time and I would suggest it.So long as you are fine with seeing religion stuff within it.

												The Binding of Isaac is a remarkably enjoyable game, and deserving of much of the praise it receives. While implementing tougher Roguelike elements, it manages to retain the fundamental accessibility and shallow learning curve that hallmark the most well-received indie titles. This is a commendable achievement, and is probably what makes it a foregone conclusion that this game will be remembered as one of the best indie games of all time. But the game does have a very glaring flaw that is too rarely pointed out. The game is short and the dungeons are small, which has the effect of making progression and completion nearly impossible unless you have a lucky start. This is really the worst that can be said of The Binding of Isaac, though, and the game is fun and rewarding at least as often as it is frustrating and unfair. Make sure that you have a very solid handle on the base game before you even consider getting the Wrath of the Lamb expansion, as it ramps up difficulty considerably.			"

												It is one of the best and toughest games that i have played, the beginning is easy, but the difficulty level to level increases considerably, not forgetting the key points in this game:- Simple gameplay, but challenging.- Simple Atmosphere.- A great touch of humor that developers added to this great title.- Tons of items, enemies and abilities.- The soundtrack and sound effects give a very special touch.I bought this game in steam sales (Ultra cheap) and i do not regret purchasing it.10 / 10			"

												The Binding of Isaac Game ReviewThe binding of Isaac is a indie rogue-like platformer game about a child called Isaac and his crazy religious mother. It is a game filled with secrets and unlockable characters and items with 2 DLC packs. After playing The Binding of Isaac for a few hours I realised there was a reason so many people described the game as “Unforgiving” and “disturbing”, It’s because its filled with satanic references, blood and gore. Not only that but The Binding of Isaac is incredibly difficult, only after my first 10 tries was I able to kill mom once. My favourite thing about The Binding of Isaac would have to be the game breaking aspect. By game breaking I mean there are some incompatible items in the game which cause you to have infinite health or can help you to get every item in the game. There is actually a massive part of the community that has dedicated itself to finding game breaking glitches that can make them extremely overpowered; some of these people have broken the game to the extent that a single attack on any boss will kill them instantly.Controls and GameplayThe controls to The Binding of Isaac are basic. WASD to move and your arrow keys to direct your attack. You move around the basement from room to room, each room containing something different. There are normal rooms which contain enemies, gold rooms which contain power up items that will impact your speed, damage, health and can sometimes impact you negatively. You first meet Isaac and his mother in the loading screen for the game which describes their lives as being happy until she hears a voice from above. The voice of god tells her to kill Isaac and Isaac, hearing this, flees into the houses basement to get away from his homicidal mother which is when the games main menu loads.  The game is about Isaac making his way through the basement to eventually reach and kill the boss, Mom. As you make your way through the basement you will encounter multiple different types of enemies (foetuses, pinworms, embryos, flaming headless monsters and lots of bugs) which will all try to kill you.Graphics and SoundThe graphics for The Binding of Isaac were made to have a retro feel to them. They have options for the in game detail which affects the rooms you enter. High detail means there will be cobwebs and blood on the walls while low detail will give you none of that. The detail setting also affects the pixels in game so setting it to low will give you a very fuzzy effect while high makes it look HD in comparison. The music in The Binding of Isaac is very varied. The music changes depending on the floor and room you are on/in. The music keeps you focused while playing and can help you to know what type of room or floor you are on.  The sounds in The Binding of Isaac are very eerie to say the least. The squishing noises when you kill monsters and the screaming from bosses I found to be very unsettling when I was playing and actually impacted on my performance when I was playing. Replayability and MultiplayerThe Binding of Isaac is literally the most replayable game I have ever played; this is because of how unforgiving the game and how interesting the storyline is. With over 341 items and 178 secrets in the game you must replay constantly to finish the game with everything unlocked. There has never been a official multiplayer feature for The Binding of Isaac however the great community surrounding it has created a few multiplayer mods for people to use. This let you play 2 players with you and another person on the same keyboard and you can both move around and shoot and fight enemies. Although the multiplayer mod is good, I think it ruins the game as there is no balancing aspect to the mod meaning there is now2 players but the same amount of bosses and enemies.To ConcludeI found The Binding of Isaac to be a ridiculously good indie game. The complexity of the story line and the references to religion surprised me and definitely made me enjoy the game a lot more. At only £4.00 this game is definitely one I would pick up off the steam store, especially as it is now one of my most played games and it’s one of the cheapest I own, this game practically pays for itself in minutes. The games DLC is also worth getting as it doubles the amount of content that is already inside this jam packed game, it adds characters, items, floors, monsters and more difficult bosses.  So to give this game a rating I would have to give it a:•	Easy to learn controls ✓•	Gameplay ✓•	Graphics ✓•	Sound/Music ✓•	Replayable ✓•	Multiplayer  XRATED 5/6			"

												As of writing this review I'm still trying to get the no hit womb achievement which is a ***** to get but Issac is a game that I'm willing to give my time to as it may be the most value for money I've ever seen in a game.If you try to complete everything that the game has you will be playing for more than 800 hours (or that my time spend in the game anyway) and for the price the game asks for expecially when it's on sale you will get every cent out of it.my only problem with the game is the fullscreen isn't that great and you can't seem to rebind the keys or use a controller.though Rebirth is out I highly recommend this game if you don't have the money for it or you want a good time waster.

												The Binding of Isaac is by far the most grotesque and insane game I’ve played.  It’s pure mayhem and requires skill and patience to master. You play as Isaac who had to hide himself in his basement to avoid being murdered by his mother who was told by God to kill him. You venture through 8 levels gathering items, bonuses, and anything you can wield to face your mom. No play through is same because the levels are randomly generated. It’s an insanely addictive game that has huge replay ability and it will definitely keep you entertained for hours on end.			"

												Umm... I don't know what to say about this game. it's... Weird. But overall (Even though i played a little on this account, and about 250+ hours on my old account), it's a fantastic, evenly priced game. Gives a Lot of Hours of Gameplay (Reaching the Cathedral is HARD, and takes over 13 successful runs that take a crapton of time >.<), with Many (MANY!) Items that appear randomly through the many levels (Random as well, for Pretty much Endless Fun), And will make you Become pretty much a Tank to anything that comes after You. A thing that's also Impressive is that how The game itself has a Kind of Creepy and Morbid Gameplay, but also Really Fun and Bizzarre, and Still Holding up to Comic-Like Graphics. More things like Challenges, Character selection (Each with its own Special Item and Starting Stats), A Handful of different Enemies, Random Bosses Each Level, Collection of Items, A lot of In-Game and Steam Achievements (With Many In-Game Unlockables to be found), An Interesting Backstory of the Main Character And a Fantastic amount of 13+ Endings, Make the Icing on this Strange But Amazing Cake. Also, You can ""Tear"" Down Enemies. *Da Bum Tss*. Overall, For me it's 9.2/10.			"

												Probably the first game I've ever played where I can end up both hating it and love it at the same time, it's a cartoony dark souls, you'll die... you'll die lots. You may have a good run where you get lots of fantastic items, and then the next it will be constant rubbish, but half the fun is trying to get as far as you can with the things you have (I'm sure there is a life lesson in there)The graphics are nice, the music is ok but it does get very repetitive quickly, the gameplay is fun but frustrating (vague memories of hurling abuse at the screen), however when you have stupid amounts of failure and then finish it, that is a great feeling of pride. whether full price or on sale, it's a bargain			"

												Another beautifully composed game by Team Meat (Edmund McMillen and Tommy Refenes), a small independent developer who also created top hit Super Meat Boy. The Binding of Isaac strikes a resemblance to the original Legend of Zelda exploration esque gameplay through caves and dungeons, except in this title the main character (and arguable protagonist) Isaac ventures through his basement trying to escape his mother who is asked by the voice of God to make a sacrifice to prove her faith. The game implements great gameplay mechanics (which adapt to your style of progressing through the game to continuously increase the games difficulty), clever visuals, and a great plot to create an amazing atmosphere in a must have PC title.

												I have to say, The Binding of Isaac is one of the most addicting games I have ever played.If you ask me, I have launched this game ATLEAST once or twice a DAY to get my ose of it. It's a little disturbing in some places, sure, but it brings comedy, horror, and PLOT into the game. You play as a boy named Isaac, a boy who has been doing sinful things throughout his life. His mother becomes insane, hearing that her son is the work of the devil, and he must be saved by being punished. With death. It's godly enough to be a nice rogue like, game. I suggest to buy the game.			"

												I must highly recommend this game it's simple, fun, and challenging. Trying to get no-damage achievements makes me cry.. okay, perhaps sometimes it's more challenging than fun. I like it though, even then.. Not good for players who want every achievement in a game with low effort - it's not going to happen here. Getting most achievements will take a lot of time - but it feels so rewarding to survive.. and getting an achievement is even more so. The game requires a dlc to finish, still - it's quite affordable, WoTL doubles the game length, increases difficulty - adds more variety.  I feel a DLC is worth the cash, even for those who don't intend to 100% the game. Just be prepared, pick up and win won't happen, in fact it requires quite a few playthroughs to unlock all the items, including a few of the most powerful ones. Though somewhat morbid, this top-down adventure game has definitely earned a spot in my top 5 favorite games on steam.~ Good luck in this game, I hope you give it the time to grow on you, and enjoy it as much as I have. Definitely a 10/10 from me.			"

												It was the Winter Sale and everyone was all aboard the hype train. Choo Choooo! I jumped on board.But after hours and hours of playing, I have to say, this is what Extra Credits was talking about when they spoke about the difference between a challenging game and a punishing game. In a challenging game, one is forced to rely on skill, sometimes within a steep learning curve, but there's a high risk reward factor because you know if you do a good job, put in the time and effort to get better, make the smarter calls, you will be rewarded with greater success. There is a system to master, not game or exploit, but master- and when you manage to, you feel like the Master. In a punishing game, like so, you can in one run through be given 2 power ups per room and 2 spiders to defeat per room or NO power ups for 6 straight levels, 8 monsters per room, and every chest gives you multiple bombs that chase you until they explode. Because the effects of the same actions can produce such varying results, the overall feeling over time is that your actions aren't what matters.The end result for me is that instead of feeling challenged, I feel Punished for playing. I might as well have enjoyed rolling a die. To its credit, this has better graphics than just rolling a die and lots of kooky 3spooky5me atmosphere to immerse itself in, good music, and decent controls. But I don't really care if it's a high-spec 120 fps HD sensory feast factory. If the end result is still that it's all a crap shoot, that half the time I should just restart until I get a better first few levels, then there comes a painful awareness the more one plays that the outcome has less to do with me than with all those die rolls.

												I told myself I wasn't going to write a review until I beat the game. But after playing 3 hours of this brutal top down dungeon crawler I realized I may never write a review. With that being said, lets get right into it. The Binding of Isaac is a top down dungeon crawler game based off of a story in the Bible. The story goes is that there is a a man named Abraham who is visted by God himself and is asked to sacrafice his son Isaac. This story is a lot like The Binding of Isaac (Discount the monsters and dungeons). Right off the bat you can see that The Binding of Isaac is not just some regular top down dungeon crawler game. It has amazing art combined with a dark depressing theme. Each and every enemy you encounter will shock you, you will have to remember these enemies, how they look like, and their attack patterns in order to advance further into the game. The items are goofy and loveable. Now lets do some pros and cons.Pros:- Fantasic soundtrack that will always keep you pumped up for the next boss- Vague yet incapturing story- A large variety of enemies that will only get harder as you avance further into the game- Unlockable characters, somthing to always strive to- There are indeed multiple endings- Until you've seen all endings and unlocked all characters and collected all items, there is always replay valueCons:- This game is impossibly difficultI know there is only one con but that con is no joke. This game is hard and unforgiving. It's fun at times but it really does suck when you die right before the ""Mom Fight"". It has a deep learning curve and there is no description on any item you get, which means in order to use it right you have to look it up on the wikia. If you intend on buying this game there is a few things to know.1) You are buying a game that is difficult, and there's no way of changing that.2)  If you plan on really going hard at this game, there is some reseach and memorizing involed.3) If you are religious in any way, you may find this game's content to be offensive. My final thought on this game is that it's a well made indie cult classic. I enjoy this game enough to play it every once and a while but not crazy about it. As for the DLC and Rebirth, I do not plan on buying those anytime soon. 8.5/10			"

												I told myself I wasn't going to write a review until I beat the game. But after playing 3 hours of this brutal top down dungeon crawler I realized I may never write a review. With that being said, lets get right into it. The Binding of Isaac is a top down dungeon crawler game based off of a story in the Bible. The story goes is that there is a a man named Abraham who is visted by God himself and is asked to sacrafice his son Isaac. This story is a lot like The Binding of Isaac (Discount the monsters and dungeons). Right off the bat you can see that The Binding of Isaac is not just some regular top down dungeon crawler game. It has amazing art combined with a dark depressing theme. Each and every enemy you encounter will shock you, you will have to remember these enemies, how they look like, and their attack patterns in order to advance further into the game. The items are goofy and loveable. Now lets do some pros and cons.Pros:- Fantasic soundtrack that will always keep you pumped up for the next boss- Vague yet incapturing story- A large variety of enemies that will only get harder as you avance further into the game- Unlockable characters, somthing to always strive to- There are indeed multiple endings- Until you've seen all endings and unlocked all characters and collected all items, there is always replay valueCons:- This game is impossibly difficultI know there is only one con but that con is no joke. This game is hard and unforgiving. It's fun at times but it really does suck when you die right before the ""Mom Fight"". It has a deep learning curve and there is no description on any item you get, which means in order to use it right you have to look it up on the wikia. If you intend on buying this game there is a few things to know.1) You are buying a game that is difficult, and there's no way of changing that.2)  If you plan on really going hard at this game, there is some reseach and memorizing involed.3) If you are religious in any way, you may find this game's content to be offensive. My final thought on this game is that it's a well made indie cult classic. I enjoy this game enough to play it every once and a while but not crazy about it. As for the DLC and Rebirth, I do not plan on buying those anytime soon. 8.5/10			"

												Binding of Isaac..Yes, the Binding of Isaac is one of the deepest, heart touching and emotionful game about life of a little boy named Isaac. It has many Bible references, those make the game more mysterious and interesting. Not willing to spoil anything, but it's more like how Isaacs life turned into hell. He just lived a happy, joyful and simple life with his Mother in a small house on a hill. But one day Isaacs Mom heard a voice from above.. The God tells his Mother to prove her faith in him by sacrificing Isaac.The gameplay reminded me a lot of Zelda games - Bombs: used to break rocks, kill enemies and cut Your way through closed doors if needed. Coins: Used to play slot machines, buy items and etc. Keys: Unlock treasure rooms and other locked doors. It is also a very random, no two runs are the same, random pick-ups and enemies. Variety of items - over 250 items! every collectible You pick will be shown on Your character. Make Your shots (tears) stronger by collecting those items to defeat more difficult bosses, make Your Character faster by collecting other types of items, to dodge enemy attacks and so on! I'm definitely recommending it! You won't regret! The soundtrack is also very nice and fits the game. Many endings will keep You satisfied to play more, even if You die (Death is permanent in game).But the game has a deeper meaning to it, wayy deeper, it is what it makes so original and very different, from the other games, even games from the same creator. Yes, it is sad and You'll understand it once You've beaten the game 10th time..Have a nice time playing this amazing game!-Circumflex			"

												I have a personal connection with this game because it combined something I love which is videogames & something I hate which is religion. This game is a breath of fresh air against all the crap in religion & I honestly recommend this game if you have a gloomy day or you just want to let off some steam so if you like classic Zelda games & you hate religion go play this game.

One of the reasons why it is so addictive is with every initiation of the game, it is randomised, and therefore remains refreshing on every playthrough. It's good that its like this, since there's a long progression path to unlocking everything and unlocking platinum god. This game is a must have. 9.5/10			"

												This game is not for everyone. It's tough as nails and very dependant on luck. If you like roguelikes, exploration, and finding great combos, this is the game for you. Don't touch it if you prefer more casual experiences, if dying bothers you or if you don't like starting for the beginning on each run, without saves.Once you put that aside, it has a very deep meaning hidden behind those cartoonish graphics. The game will keep you on your toes, making you wonder what's next and how to overcome them. Even in adversity, a little of good luck can turn the tide of the battle, and making poor decisions is punishing.However, as you play, you'll develop new strategies, and find combinations and combinations of items that are going to help you survive the horrid world that is the basement. You'll get beams, lasers, chocolate and more to fight your enemies, which get increasingly hard. Even with bad luck, good reflexes and strategy will make you survive each run. "

												A great game. Truly awesome graphics with perfect gameplay. It is very difficult for me though; when I bought the game I bought the DLC (Wrath of the Lamb) with it and you cannot turn the DLC off. The DLC makes it much harder so it's taking me some time to adapt but it is still extremely fun. Great game, especially for it's price of $5. You cannot find anything better for it's price. It is much better than many $10 - $20 I've played! This is a must-buy.			"

												This game is hard. Very hard. It throws you right in at the deep end with no knowledge of any of the huge catalogue of items, or enemies you will face, or even the rooms you will go through, but it has so much replay value. I must have played this game at least 1000 times by now, and I'm not even close to being bored, or even finishing the game. There is so much variability in this game's randomely generated rooms, floors, enemies and bosses, and you feel a huge sense of accomplishment every time you beat that tough boss or get past that awful room, and if and when you get lucky with items, you feel unstoppable, until you die, start again, and are as weak and pathetic as you always were. Enjoy.			"

None the less, extremely satisfying to master and dominate. Controls could be tighter, but are sufficient. Huge fan of Edmund, and Florian. I actually started this Steam account, a few years back just to download The Binding of Isaac, and it definitely needs a spot in your indie collection, as well.

												The Bnding of Issac is a (like most people all it) a Zelda-like dungeon crawler. Yep, damn straight that's what it is. While this game is awesome, there are a few things that I have issues with. Let's start with the good things, shall we? Okay, the art style is awesome! I love the cartoony yet dark feel this game has to it. While it is a game that is dead serious, it's pretty funny with all of it's power-ups (which there are a frigging ton of) and bosses. Oh and good GOD ALMIGHTY that soundtrack. The music is creepy and also very catchy. PLUS! Every dungeon/ basement or whatthe♥♥♥♥ ever is random EVERY TIME, making every playthrough different. The characters and story are cool and funny (and down-right terrifying sometimes) and the enemies are also creepy and sometimes cute-ish. Now, those 'bad things' I said earlier? They really don't matter; but here we go. First, it's a flash game; therefore, it runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥(for me. I have an awfull computer). The lag, yes, can really pull me from the game, but it's something I get used to. And finally is that a lot of the power-ups are kindda crappy. But all-in-all, it's a great game, and I can easily recomend everyone to it.     Final Score=8.75/10Edit: I got Windows 8.1 and somehow my game runs like 50% better. Final FINAL Score =9.75/10			"

												Story: A bit dark and filled with jabs at religion. That doesn't bother me, but the game is definitly not appropriate for a younger audience and those who don't take religion jokes lightly.  Also, some of the bosses/mobs are a bit gruesome and distrubing (but I dont mind!!).The game without the DLC has about 7 levels, takes me about an hour (on a good run) to beat the game. Considering that I have more than 20 hours into this game and have only beaten it 5 times :C. The trick to this game is that death is permanent for your current playthrough. Once you die you have to restart at the beginning and pray for good items. IF you aren't accustomed to the perma-death scenario I don't reccommend this game. I enjoy it purely because of the flexibility of the levels and the ever-changing drops. This game is a great game and has a good price imo.			"

												Top-down 2D dungeon crawler roguelike.A game that relies on replayability by giving the player different runs every time he plays through the game. By completing the game multiple times, more items and areas are unlocked.The game is structured through floors that consist of rooms, which are randomly generated and can include various things from enemies to special Items.Each floor features an itemroom that includes a passive or activatible item to aid the player in the rather hard rooms filled with treacherous enemies. If the player is unable to dodge correctly, he will find himself getting damages quite often and ending runs preemptively.To progress from floor to floor the player has to defeat the boss of each floor, who also drop passive items that increase health, damage or other stats.Since the release of Rebirth I would not recommend buying the original game, mostly because of performance issues related to the flash-engine that the game uses.

												This game is not for everyone. It's tough as nails and very dependant on luck. If you like roguelikes, exploration, and finding great combos, this is the game for you. Don't touch it if you prefer more casual experiences, if dying bothers you or if you don't like starting for the beginning on each run, without saves.Once you put that aside, it has a very deep meaning hidden behind those cartoonish graphics. The game will keep you on your toes, making you wonder what's next and how to overcome them. Even in adversity, a little of good luck can turn the tide of the battle, and making poor decisions is punishing.However, as you play, you'll develop new strategies, and find combinations and combinations of items that are going to help you survive the horrid world that is the basement. You'll get beams, lasers, chocolate and more to fight your enemies, which get increasingly hard. Even with bad luck, good reflexes and strategy will make you survive each run. "

Despite its cute gooryness, its a very entertaining game with lots of items to upgrade one of the 5 unlockable characters.It fun to dodge and run trough all the little mutated babies, trying to kill them with your upgradable spit.The variety in items and enemies is really impressive. While playing i'm guarantiing you will be curious to see what comes next in each room you will enter, or seeiing how an item changes the appearance of your character.TIP: when taking an offer from satan, don't pick the cat item, it gives you 9 lives, but 1 life is just 1 heart unless you're looking to increase the difficulty of the game then go ahead:) "

												Awesomely addictive game! At first it may seem hard, but you will get better at it.Shocking amount of items to pick up, huge number of different enemies and bosses.Only downside is the fraterate lags every now and then because of flash.Quick and fast paced game, perfect to burn an hour here and there.

												Brilliant game! Very fun, with tons of replay value. So many items and randomly generated floors make the game very different each time, also the art is great. 9/10 I would have given it a 10/10 but achievements on mac do not work, so I had to login on a windows computer for my achievements to register, due to the achievements file being a .exe file, which mac cannot open. Otherwise great game, definitely recommended :D			"

												I bought this game with the DLC for something around 0.65€ on sale (lol, almost for free!), but it offers far more than you'd expect from the game costing so little. At first I was like:""Dude, what the F. There's poop everywhere, disgusting stuff..."" and all that....but I gave this game a chance, and I sincerely don't have any regrets. Of course, it has its minor flaws - Flash makes this game little bit slow.BUT: the gameplay is excellent, it has brilliant OST that will never get boring, it's highly addictive.Rebirth (renewed version) is much more better-er, but if you can't afford it, this one will do just fine too.

												 Little late to the party, but I want to try out this new ""Steam Reviews"" thing by reviewing The Binding of Isaac. Contrary to popular belief, The Binding of Isaac is not hard, more, unforgiving. Many will be turned off by the nature of reviews stating it is hard and requires much skill. I find it, however, more unforgiving than ""hard"". Yes, there is a difference.""Well, what do you mean?"", says random bystander awed by hearing other's analysis being gone against. Well, you see, anyone who has played The Binding of Isaac can tell you it is a randomly generated game. This aspect gives it a very nice value of replayablility. Luck is a key factor in this generation, so you want a ""lucky"" run. However, anyone with a lot of skill CAN beat this game with crappy items. You see, the challenge does not stem from its risky 1 life gameplay style, as you can restart and get better items, possibly a 1-up to give you another life, the challenge comes from the random generation and♥♥♥♥♥♥loads of projectiles. However, you can master this game. Like I said before, you can use your skill to beat this game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ items. Some strategies such as Secret Room guessing, and knowing how to avoid certain items really helps a lot. The secret to beating this game is to be immersed in its content and variables.  ""So what? You can beat the game if you take into consideration your knowledge of this game. What makes you think more people will buy it?"", says a bystander who keeps getting owned by Peeps. Well, you see, The Binding of Isaac has had a reputation for being an infamously hard game. The real ironic thing is, people can beat it in their first few runs. Then more content unlocks, and they gradually keep becoming better at the game. The game is not hard, its just a thing you can't plow through. I hope this will help people off put by the game's reputation as ""hard"" join in on the fun. I'm sorry this isn't much of a review, I'm really busy (With doing nothing) and I can't be bothered to write a full review. Though to truly know this game, you must play it yourself. Bye, and I hope to see you all again in 2014.			"

												The Bnding of Issac is a (like most people all it) a Zelda-like dungeon crawler. Yep, damn straight that's what it is. While this game is awesome, there are a few things that I have issues with. Let's start with the good things, shall we? Okay, the art style is awesome! I love the cartoony yet dark feel this game has to it. While it is a game that is dead serious, it's pretty funny with all of it's power-ups (which there are a frigging ton of) and bosses. Oh and good GOD ALMIGHTY that soundtrack. The music is creepy and also very catchy. PLUS! Every dungeon/ basement or whatthe♥♥♥♥ ever is random EVERY TIME, making every playthrough different. The characters and story are cool and funny (and down-right terrifying sometimes) and the enemies are also creepy and sometimes cute-ish. Now, those 'bad things' I said earlier? They really don't matter; but here we go. First, it's a flash game; therefore, it runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥(for me. I have an awfull computer). The lag, yes, can really pull me from the game, but it's something I get used to. And finally is that a lot of the power-ups are kindda crappy. But all-in-all, it's a great game, and I can easily recomend everyone to it.     Final Score=8.75/10Edit: I got Windows 8.1 and somehow my game runs like 50% better. Final FINAL Score =9.75/10			"

												Well where to start with this game :D when i first got it in a humble bundle i didn't play it because i thought it was extremly bad,but after a frenemy convinced me to play it i was litterally hooked on it nonstop and i didn't play any other games till i got 100% on this game. Ok so il explain this game quickly, you play as Isaac a little kid who fires tears at enemys in his basement to kill them, it is a very hard game it has taking me 194 hours to 100% it, although it is filled with unlockable items and charecters which keeps it fresh each time you play it, although it uses the layout of the original legend of zelda dungeons i overall recommend this game but only if you get it with the wrath of the lamb expansion pack.

												I passed up on this game a while ago because I wasn't entirely sure about it. Just a while ago, I purchased the game for $5 on Steam and started playing it. This game is extremely fun. There is no reason for anyone who likes games to not get this game. The game costs $5 and I've already played it longer than some $20-$40 games.STORY:You play as Isaac, a small child who has been thrown into the basement under his house after his mother supposedly heard a message from god telling her to sacrifice her son. You, as Isaac, must traverse the basement, going deeper and deeper in an effort to survive the horrors in the depths below.GAMEPLAY:The game takes place from a Birds-eye viewpoint, and you control Isaac using WASD and his tear shots using the arrow keys or the mouse. His tears can shoot in 4 cardinal directions (NSEW) and are used as Isaacs primary attack. On your way, there are secret rooms to find coins, shops to purchase items, treasure rooms to get new abilities, boss rooms to fight bosses, devil rooms to give up some hearts for a rare and special item, and so forth. The game has enough variety to keep me coming back for more and trying to perfect my ""run"".GRAPHICS:The game uses a sort-of cutesy vector graphics format, which works well in contrast of the dark undertones of the game. Elements and enemies that need to stand out do so, while things that aren't as important don't attract your eyes attention, something very important in games similar to The Binding of Isaac.BALANCE:The Binding of Isaac is well balanced, but it is easier to talk about what is not balanced rather than talk about what is. Tears Upgrades tend to be rather useless, as they are outshadowed in usefullness by their bigger brother ""The Damage Upgrade"", and the knockback produced from tears can go out of control with enough tears upgrades, sending enemies flying in all directions and making it harder to dodge. The game is also based on luck quite a bit, from the upgrades you draw to the rooms that you find, but it also requires a lot of skill, something you earn from playing the game. Additionally, some of the upgrades just plain suck. Other than that, the game is well balanced.OVERVIEW:The Binding of Isaac is a Birds-Eye dungeon crawler with a fantastic concept and huge buckets of replayability. This game would be high up on my Top 10 Favorite Games list if I had one.			"

												This game offers gameplay that will punish you for your major mistakes but allows you to learn from the small ones and that is where you grow. Most of the difficulty doesnt come from the enemies or the bosses bt it comes from learning how each item works and how to work with it because most of the items  you pick up you cannot get rid of ,meaning  that if you get an item that you hate you have to deal with it. Needless to say a wiki is a godsend when it comes to items and bosses beause some of the effects of the items are barely noticable unless you pay intense attention. Overall this game offers crushing but addictive gameplay , amazingly high replay value , and multiple endings making you wonder what just happened .			"

												Awesome game with very good replay value!Update: While this game is great in its own aspect, I would strongly recommend picking up The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth instead, as it functions better and overall feels like a better game. However, the original Binding of Isaac is great for nostalgic purposes!			"

												I first thought I would never like this game: it was weird, creepy and roguelike (something im terrible at).But after a while i grew to like it because of its ability to fit into one half of my screen while I watched youtube in the other.It also does a really good job of giving you a sense of achievement: when i beat mom's heart for the fikrst time i was the most excited about beating a boss than i ever was.In conclusion i would recommend getting this game on a sale with wrath of the lamb.it makes a huge difference.

The Wrath of the Lamb DLC is a must, though you might want to play through the original first just to see how much great change was put into tWotL.

												Do you like rougelikes? Great. Get this game.Do you hate rougelikes and got BoI to try to make yourself like it? Don't bother. This game will not convince you. It runs on the idea that you WILL go back to it and try to beat level after level. Thats great. Those that like that will love it.The art style has a childish creepiness that I honestly like. Each powerup changes issac a bit to add some kind of progression. The powerups are great by the way.If there was a mod that would auto save after each level I'd actually play it and most likely beat it.As far as I'm concerned this game only makes me wish the refund system existed when I bought it.No, I won't uninstall it. I want people to know I gave it a very fair shot several times.I even bought Wrath of the Lamb, but I do not know what it does.But just because I hated it does not mean you won't like it. if you like roguelikes this is literally the perfect game for you.I did not enjoy this experince. You'll be different. Go and save Issac because i will not bother attempting again.A silly following bomb with a trollface painted on it  / 10			"

												First of all this game has a style and it is something more than just a dungeon & loot game, It has a spirit.When i started playing, the soundtacks and isaac's story impressed me, but it was really hard to play and i could barely survive 1 or 2 floors. As i played and started learning new things about the game (i am still learning in spite of my playtime) it has just became more and more enjoying because there are tons of monsters, items, achievements (most of the achievements unlock an item so it has a chance to drop when you unlock the achievement), and bosses in the game. When you die, you start from the begining, but it never bothered me because everything is completely random. Everytime you play, every single monster, every room, every boss, every item you get and even the alignment of rooms are different! The facts like there are 2 secret rooms every floor, or pills giving you random effects, or the devil and angel rooms makes the game even more exciting . Besides it is replayable-duh- when you finish the game for the first time it adds two more levels (floors) and more bosses to the game and when you finish the game like 11th time it unlocks 3 more levels (one of them is optional). The downside is, it sometimes really stimulates me to lose all those gear I collected because of a momentary mistake but I am really glad I bought the game. It is a ''must have'' in my opinion. If you haven't bought the game yet, I highly recommend you to buy it. And it is becoming a timeless classic.			"

												After playing Super meat boy, I started looking out for new games by the same developer. Edmund Mcmillen’s wonderfully strange imagination is an interesting thing to explore through his games, that’s for sure.This game was not a disappointment. At first, I had no idea what to expect, the trailer was very strange but a tad intriguing. When I came across it there was next to no information about the game and the mechanics of it on the store page and back then there was no costumer reviews to go off of. Admittedly I never actually brought it to give it a go off of the information I was given, I ended up with it from a bundle and it’s the only reason I really played it. Although I wish I had taken the leap to try it because it is well worth it.Binding of Isaac is a randomly generated dungeon crawler, one I have heard to be described as Zelda-like you’re a young boy running from his demented mother. Who has been blinded by her hard-core Christianity and believes that the voice of god has spoken to her and told her to murder her son to prove her loyalty. So a very interesting concept, indeed.A short cut scene plays on start-up, which expands on what I just described, you find yourself wandering through randomly generated dungeon floors, fighting monsters, picking up loot and items as you go along that changes how you fight, gives you different abilities and drastically changes Isaac’s image. At the end of each floor, you fight a boss, and move on down to the next floor. It being harder than before, with a bigger space to explore and more enemies to defeat.There’s a large range of items to collect that when found for the first time is added to the “things I found” section in the main menu, so a lovely bit of collecting there to entice those OCD minded like myself, There’s new characters to unlock which vary in stats, challenges to complete and even some DLC that can extend your gameplay.You are given one life and one life only. You can find hearts to heal, but once you are dead, that’s it, you start all over again. So throughout the whole game and especially when nearing the end, it starts to put a little pressure on and gets that heart rate going. I’m not one to be good under pressure so it gets me every time. I FINALLY managed to complete the game a few times over, again, admittedly, only after I gained some “top tips” from my way-to-good-at-games brother. There have been people that have completed the game 10 times over and still not gotten bored. I think that the randomly generated dungeon element to it keeps its replay ability intact. If it were to replay the same levels over and over when you died, the game would be a lot different and no doubt a lot less popular. I have heard from friends that it is quite hard to complete without “doing your research” on the wiki or seeking tips from those nerdy minded like my brother who managed to figure all of it out themselves. I on the other hand find that kind of thing enjoyable, because it beats you every time and you work and research and try to understand the game more to finally get to that ending. I can quite honestly say that the first time I reached the end, my heart has never beaten that loud or that fast in a long time. And that sense of accomplishment you get from finishing a game, is a on a much higher scale when you work to complete this one. The music is great, it fits the setting perfectly and is great to listen to. Rarely have I actually wanted to download a game’s soundtrack, I can give most soundtracks a thumbs up but not often do I actually want to listen to game music outside of gaming.The art, as per usual in Edmunds games, is amazing. And I hear they are also looking to remake the game to have a more “retro” look, with possible multiplayer features. Which should be very interesting. For those interested you can look up “Binding of Isaac: Rebirth”.All in all, it is a great indie game, which is both fun and challenging. Definitely worth trying, I am not usually the dungeon crawler type, but this game is a lot of fun. The only fault that I had with this game, which has bothered me quite a few times now, is that I have lost my save for no reason. The game is listed as having ‘Steam Cloud’ features, but it definitely doesn't work. I haven't uninstalled the game, I haven't touched it. But recently I hopped on and seen all the progress that I had made was gone. And for a game that has no real save points or ongoing plot to keep up with, your stats, unlocked characters and collection of things you have found is pretty much all you have. I was pretty upset to see it had vanished and it’s something I felt I needed to warn people about. TL;DR : Awesome music, fun and engaging game with a slightly 'twisted' side to it. It's a challenge to reach the end and you can definitely end up putting a lot of hours into this. Addictive and awesome all around.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a roguelike game in which you play as a child traversing through randomly generated levels with the goal of stopping your mom from killing you. There is a large number of items that also randomly generate each playthrough that you can use to aid in your adventure. As you play the game, you unlock secrets and additional items to use in future playthroughs.With the Wrath of Lamb DLC, there are additional items, a new item type, floors (as opposed to levels), and bosses. The DLC also introduces challenges that limit (or otherwise challenge) you, which upon completion unlock new items for the main game. If you are considering buying The Binding of Isaac, I highly recommend also purchasing the Wrath of Lamb DLC.This game is heavy on both skill and luck. You will die a lot when you start playing the game. It will take many, many attempts to defeat the first final boss for the first time. As you complete playthroughs and unlock secrets, you will gain skill and new items that may help you in future playthroughs. The biggest issue with this game is that the framerate drops when a lot of tears (projectiles) or flashing enemies (flies), probably due to using the Flash engine. This is highly noticeable while playing the game, especially upon completing two certain bosses. It took me at least 10 in-game hours to get used to the wild framerate. Another issue is that the game may almost crash when it tries generating certain floors, which can be resolved by waiting for the program to respond even if the option to close the problem comes up.If you are interested in the game and would probably play this game a lot (tens and tens of hours), I would recommend purchasing The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, which is a remake of the original game and DLC. A lot of new items, challenges, characters, enemies, and bosses are introduced. The art style is better (imo), the mechanics are better due to the change in game engine, and the game runs much more smoothly. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth costs $14.99 normally. It is up to you on which you purchase if you want to.			"

												This game offers gameplay that will punish you for your major mistakes but allows you to learn from the small ones and that is where you grow. Most of the difficulty doesnt come from the enemies or the bosses bt it comes from learning how each item works and how to work with it because most of the items  you pick up you cannot get rid of ,meaning  that if you get an item that you hate you have to deal with it. Needless to say a wiki is a godsend when it comes to items and bosses beause some of the effects of the items are barely noticable unless you pay intense attention. Overall this game offers crushing but addictive gameplay , amazingly high replay value , and multiple endings making you wonder what just happened .			"

												One of my favorite games of all time!The binding of Isaac is a rough like game, where you have to go through a sereis of rooms, in order to omplete a level.The game is acually difficult, amnd at times, you will have geat challanges to overcome, like bosses or big pulls of enemyes.The story is simple, you are playing as Isaac (or some of the charectes you can unlock) and has to escape Mom, becouse she is trying to kill you in gods name. The story is not really anything that matters for a game like this, but it is nice to know why Isaac is running around in a creappy basement, full of monsters.The controles are simple, you can move in any direction, and you can shot in four directions, up, down, left and right. Along the way you will find upgrades, that can make you shot in other directions, shot faster, do more damage, gain more life, get friends to shot together with you and many more items.The funny part about the items, is that they don`t tell you, what the item can do. You either have to look at your stats, or try to shot, in order to see what the item did for you. If nothing changes, it can get really diffecult to find out what the item did, and you have to remember what meny items did, so you don`t end up downgrading youself.There are also tarot cards, that do diffrent things like clearing rooms, make enemyes take damage, teleport ypu and many more things.There are diffrent roomes on the map, that do diffrent things.The plain rooms, are just a figting room, you have to kill all the enemeyes in a room, in order to countinue to a nother room.There is a sacrifice room, where you have to take damage, in order to get an item.There is the a shop, where you can buy items for coins, this can be health, weapons, tarot cards, nearly everything.Then there is a secret room, where you have to bomb away a wall, in order to get in. If you don`t have a map that shows you where this room is, you have to bomb random walls.There is an arcade, where you can gamble, with your money and win prices.Then there is a tressure room, where you unlock the door with a key, in order to get an item.And then there is the boss rooms, and this is where the real action happens. To advance in the game, you have to defeat a boss, and the bosses are random selected, based on whitch floor you are on. The bosses can be hard, and some can be easy, but I would say they all are very injoable.So about the diffeculty, it is not only due to hard mobs and bosses, but also becouse it is a rough like game, if you die, you die, no countinues. This can get you very frusterated at times, but it is also the charm of a rough like game. You will end up dying a lot, and if you don`t have the right items, or haven`t found anything speceail, the game will punish you for that.The game has fantastic music! I love evety single track, and I promiss you will too! The music are very atmosferic, and they are good to psyck you up.This is one of my favorite games, it is fun, addicting and overall a fantastc game, thumps up. 8 out of 10			"

Randomly generated floors and items - it is so interesting to beat the game every time with a new stuffs. Also has a lot of funny things and specific sence of humor :DFor everybody who likes the ""Spelunky"", ""Rogue legacy"" and other roguelike games - is highly recommended.			"

When Isaac’s mother starts hearing the voice of God demanding a sacrifice be made to prove her faith, Isaac escapes into the basement facing droves of deranged enemies, lost brothers and sisters, his fears, and eventually his mother. 11/10			"

												Binding of Isaac has provided me with one of the most frustrating, yet funnest and most addicting game experiences ever. This is the only game where you can defeat devil himself and die to a fly in the next room. Then swear to uninstall the game or swing at your computer but after 5 seconds proceed to play 10 more games.Game has a lot of replay value because of its randomized features and several unlockable characters, multiple endings, tons of enemy types and items and big learning curve.The music is superb, and the art style is charmingly disturbing as is the story. Overall I recomend this game 100% to everyone who can get past the bizarre aesthetic and sometimes irritating rogue like elements.			"

												The concept behind this game is ridiculously easy to grasp. It's dark, it's light hearted, and you can literally play it forever. It has replay value through the roof, a ton of bosses and items that continually add to the game the more you play it, and it can be incredibly challenging. While it might not be everyones cup of tea it is definitely worth a buy.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is one of those games that grows on you. The first time I played Isaac I remember being frustrated and felt that I wasted two dollars. I never bothered to play beyond the basement. It's difficult for me to pinpoint what initially put me off from Isaac, but I chalk up my ignorance to an inability to progress. I didn't enjoy losing and quickly concluded the game was simply not for me. A couple years later one I was introduced to a livestreamer named LethalFrag. He often loaded up Binding of Isaac; one of his favorite games. While playing he often spoke highly of Isaac's replayability, soundtrack, and addictive gameplay. His praise helped me realize that Isaac deserved another look; and now I couldn't agree more with his assessment.  To appreciate The Binding of Isaac I needed to make some progress and unlock items. Dying stopped being so horrible as I faced each challenge and overcame them step by step. I understood that it was perfectly acceptable to lose; that's just part of the process. The trick was to pick myself up and learn from my mistakes. From there I was able to immerse myself in the gameplay. I've now logged over one hundred hours into the original Binding of Isaac and Wrath of the Lamb. I still find myself coming back for more. With the release of Rebirth I play the original far less often, but the newest ""Eternals"" update has got me back for what I expect will be another 100+ hours. TL;DR: The Binding of Isaac is unquestionably the best investment I've ever made on Steam. There's still plenty to appreciate, though Rebirth is now a much smoother experience.			"

												One of my favorite games of all time!The binding of Isaac is a rough like game, where you have to go through a sereis of rooms, in order to omplete a level.The game is acually difficult, amnd at times, you will have geat challanges to overcome, like bosses or big pulls of enemyes.The story is simple, you are playing as Isaac (or some of the charectes you can unlock) and has to escape Mom, becouse she is trying to kill you in gods name. The story is not really anything that matters for a game like this, but it is nice to know why Isaac is running around in a creappy basement, full of monsters.The controles are simple, you can move in any direction, and you can shot in four directions, up, down, left and right. Along the way you will find upgrades, that can make you shot in other directions, shot faster, do more damage, gain more life, get friends to shot together with you and many more items.The funny part about the items, is that they don`t tell you, what the item can do. You either have to look at your stats, or try to shot, in order to see what the item did for you. If nothing changes, it can get really diffecult to find out what the item did, and you have to remember what meny items did, so you don`t end up downgrading youself.There are also tarot cards, that do diffrent things like clearing rooms, make enemyes take damage, teleport ypu and many more things.There are diffrent roomes on the map, that do diffrent things.The plain rooms, are just a figting room, you have to kill all the enemeyes in a room, in order to countinue to a nother room.There is a sacrifice room, where you have to take damage, in order to get an item.There is the a shop, where you can buy items for coins, this can be health, weapons, tarot cards, nearly everything.Then there is a secret room, where you have to bomb away a wall, in order to get in. If you don`t have a map that shows you where this room is, you have to bomb random walls.There is an arcade, where you can gamble, with your money and win prices.Then there is a tressure room, where you unlock the door with a key, in order to get an item.And then there is the boss rooms, and this is where the real action happens. To advance in the game, you have to defeat a boss, and the bosses are random selected, based on whitch floor you are on. The bosses can be hard, and some can be easy, but I would say they all are very injoable.So about the diffeculty, it is not only due to hard mobs and bosses, but also becouse it is a rough like game, if you die, you die, no countinues. This can get you very frusterated at times, but it is also the charm of a rough like game. You will end up dying a lot, and if you don`t have the right items, or haven`t found anything speceail, the game will punish you for that.The game has fantastic music! I love evety single track, and I promiss you will too! The music are very atmosferic, and they are good to psyck you up.This is one of my favorite games, it is fun, addicting and overall a fantastc game, thumps up. 8 out of 10			"

												This game is hard. Very hard. It throws you right in at the deep end with no knowledge of any of the huge catalogue of items, or enemies you will face, or even the rooms you will go through, but it has so much replay value. I must have played this game at least 1000 times by now, and I'm not even close to being bored, or even finishing the game. There is so much variability in this game's randomely generated rooms, floors, enemies and bosses, and you feel a huge sense of accomplishment every time you beat that tough boss or get past that awful room, and if and when you get lucky with items, you feel unstoppable, until you die, start again, and are as weak and pathetic as you always were. Enjoy.			"

None the less, extremely satisfying to master and dominate. Controls could be tighter, but are sufficient. Huge fan of Edmund, and Florian. I actually started this Steam account, a few years back just to download The Binding of Isaac, and it definitely needs a spot in your indie collection, as well. So please, for the sake of Isaac, BUY this game.			"

												Dark and twisted. When I was first shown this game, I really didn't know what to think of it. However, this has been one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. In essence the game itself is a fairly fast paced action where your tears are your weapon. The sheer amount of unlockable content is what kept me replaying over and over. Still not 100% the game and I dont think I will do for a while, but it is a game I can see myself going back to for years!Although this is not a traditional genre for me, it was worth the plunge. Rebirth is coming out soon and I cannot wait!			"

												This game is a very good one as long as you don't mind the fact that it has the most satanic backstory that I have ever seen! Do not buy this game if you aren't ok with that. This game was made by Edmund Mcmillen who by the way made Super Meat Boy.  Great dungeon game. 10/10.			"

No matter what genre you like, the Binding of Isaac is a spectacular game, and once the actual meaning of it becomes apparent as you play, you realize you're playing much more than just a game about a child's imagination.

												The ultimate Bible FPS game. The Binding of Isaac shows great Christian morality and teaches the truths of God. You play as Isaac Newton, master of magnet, who must defeat the 7 deadly sins (Greed, Envy, Metallica, Bill Clinton, Cyberdemon, Evilness, and Mass Debating) and fight the Lord of Darkness himself using only a club and an apple. The game is very challenging, with lots of challenge and challenging moments. However, first time players might have difficulty on the ""Throw the controller at the wall"" part. I know I did. 666/100.*SPOILER STUFF*------------------If you have issues fighting Satin, you must use the JebusMobile powerup and ride it up Satin's♥♥♥♥♥♥(real talk: the game is pretty good and you should get it)			"

Posted: March 28, 2013
												After playing Super meat boy, I started looking out for new games by the same developer. Edmund Mcmillen’s wonderfully strange imagination is an interesting thing to explore through his games, that’s for sure.This game was not a disappointment. At first, I had no idea what to expect, the trailer was very strange but a tad intriguing. When I came across it there was next to no information about the game and the mechanics of it on the store page and back then there was no costumer reviews to go off of. Admittedly I never actually brought it to give it a go off of the information I was given, I ended up with it from a bundle and it’s the only reason I really played it. Although I wish I had taken the leap to try it because it is well worth it.Binding of Isaac is a randomly generated dungeon crawler, one I have heard to be described as Zelda-like you’re a young boy running from his demented mother. Who has been blinded by her hard-core Christianity and believes that the voice of god has spoken to her and told her to murder her son to prove her loyalty. So a very interesting concept, indeed.A short cut scene plays on start-up, which expands on what I just described, you find yourself wandering through randomly generated dungeon floors, fighting monsters, picking up loot and items as you go along that changes how you fight, gives you different abilities and drastically changes Isaac’s image. At the end of each floor, you fight a boss, and move on down to the next floor. It being harder than before, with a bigger space to explore and more enemies to defeat.There’s a large range of items to collect that when found for the first time is added to the “things I found” section in the main menu, so a lovely bit of collecting there to entice those OCD minded like myself, There’s new characters to unlock which vary in stats, challenges to complete and even some DLC that can extend your gameplay.You are given one life and one life only. You can find hearts to heal, but once you are dead, that’s it, you start all over again. So throughout the whole game and especially when nearing the end, it starts to put a little pressure on and gets that heart rate going. I’m not one to be good under pressure so it gets me every time. I FINALLY managed to complete the game a few times over, again, admittedly, only after I gained some “top tips” from my way-to-good-at-games brother. There have been people that have completed the game 10 times over and still not gotten bored. I think that the randomly generated dungeon element to it keeps its replay ability intact. If it were to replay the same levels over and over when you died, the game would be a lot different and no doubt a lot less popular. I have heard from friends that it is quite hard to complete without “doing your research” on the wiki or seeking tips from those nerdy minded like my brother who managed to figure all of it out themselves. I on the other hand find that kind of thing enjoyable, because it beats you every time and you work and research and try to understand the game more to finally get to that ending. I can quite honestly say that the first time I reached the end, my heart has never beaten that loud or that fast in a long time. And that sense of accomplishment you get from finishing a game, is a on a much higher scale when you work to complete this one. The music is great, it fits the setting perfectly and is great to listen to. Rarely have I actually wanted to download a game’s soundtrack, I can give most soundtracks a thumbs up but not often do I actually want to listen to game music outside of gaming.The art, as per usual in Edmunds games, is amazing. And I hear they are also looking to remake the game to have a more “retro” look, with possible multiplayer features. Which should be very interesting. For those interested you can look up “Binding of Isaac: Rebirth”.All in all, it is a great indie game, which is both fun and challenging. Definitely worth trying, I am not usually the dungeon crawler type, but this game is a lot of fun. The only fault that I had with this game, which has bothered me quite a few times now, is that I have lost my save for no reason. The game is listed as having ‘Steam Cloud’ features, but it definitely doesn't work. I haven't uninstalled the game, I haven't touched it. But recently I hopped on and seen all the progress that I had made was gone. And for a game that has no real save points or ongoing plot to keep up with, your stats, unlocked characters and collection of things you have found is pretty much all you have. I was pretty upset to see it had vanished and it’s something I felt I needed to warn people about. TL;DR : Awesome music, fun and engaging game with a slightly 'twisted' side to it. It's a challenge to reach the end and you can definitely end up putting a lot of hours into this. Addictive and awesome all around.			"

												First of all this game has a style and it is something more than just a dungeon & loot game, It has a spirit.When i started playing, the soundtacks and isaac's story impressed me, but it was really hard to play and i could barely survive 1 or 2 floors. As i played and started learning new things about the game (i am still learning in spite of my playtime) it has just became more and more enjoying because there are tons of monsters, items, achievements (most of the achievements unlock an item so it has a chance to drop when you unlock the achievement), and bosses in the game. When you die, you start from the begining, but it never bothered me because everything is completely random. Everytime you play, every single monster, every room, every boss, every item you get and even the alignment of rooms are different! The facts like there are 2 secret rooms every floor, or pills giving you random effects, or the devil and angel rooms makes the game even more exciting . Besides it is replayable-duh- when you finish the game for the first time it adds two more levels (floors) and more bosses to the game and when you finish the game like 11th time it unlocks 3 more levels (one of them is optional). The downside is, it sometimes really stimulates me to lose all those gear I collected because of a momentary mistake but I am really glad I bought the game. It is a ''must have'' in my opinion. If you haven't bought the game yet, I highly recommend you to buy it. And it is becoming a timeless classic.			"

It's a double-edged sword that can either keep you coming back for more, or convince you to just give up.  Either way, it's worth the experience.			"

												Positive: A game with high replayability, captivating because you can complete all the challenges, with all the characters. And even ending the game you keep playing because many different combinations, because you never have an equal race. Diversity is the wealth of this game. The fact of having a DLC also features, it is not a DLC any, is a DLC that adds several items, increased playing time, has a very good price, and hence boost the passion for the game. And do not forget the ""rewards"" of the game, the fact that you fail to pass the challenge, and after a while trying and trying, finally you can and that's where you animate to play the game more and more, yielding hours and more hours of play.Negative: A great game, more done in a platform that harmed no doubt the same. The fact that the achievements are not synchronized also damages. The game is not as fluid through the platform of fact in this case is the JAVA.			"

												At first, once I bought this game, I thought it was quite fun, but quickly it sort of just became one of the games that I don't usually play. When that point in time is reached where you don't really feel like playing The Binding of Isaac anymore, it becomes a great game to play in short, spare time because of quick play. It requires you to really, not use tactics (doesn't help when you can't see what's in the rooms next to you), but to think about how you want to approach the game. This idea of 'approaching the game' includes: the character you choose to play (which affects much of how you play, depending on their stats) or the risks that you wish to take in the hopes of gaining a higher benefit. It might not seem very understandable in the way that I've put it, but any past players of this game should realise what I'm trying to say.This game has a lot to offer for players who want a difference and a challenge compared to other games. Nevertheless, the Binding of Isaac is a brilliant game and I recommend it to anyone that wishes to purchase this game.			"

												If you liked Super Meat Boy, you'll love this game. The art style and punishing roguelike difficulty are attributed to the geniuses that are Edmund McMillen (of Team Meat) and Florian Himsl. The game is accompanied by the beautiful musical stylings of Danny Baranowsky (who also scored Super Meat Boy). Imagine Legend of Zelda, dungeons only, one life, with a dark, ""cute-grotesque"" art style. The more you play, the more items you'll be able to use. The more times you complete the game, the further you can progress. I can not recommend this game enough. Continually patched to add new things and fix bugs. The replayability is endless.			"

												Twisted comedy, endless replayability and hundrads of upgrades make the Binding of Issac one of my most played games. It is a dark twisted roguelike mixed with a layout lifted from the original zelda leading to simple controlls and easy to learn concepts with an ochean of underlieing complexity. Due to its random nature no two runs are the same and while I cant say the Asthetic is for everyone, if you are even slightly interested i would strongly suggest you give it a whirl.			"

												If a game where you shoot poop with your projectile tears to get tiny blue hearts for sustanence can keep so many people entertained for hundreds of hours each, it is something special. It has simple mechanics and is easy to get into for any gamer who likes to be constantly challenged. People who have played thousands of hours of this game can still pick it up at any time for a run. Not to mention its price, which at times of sale can be as low as 2 dollars WITH the DLC. There is no reason for everybody to not have this game already.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a fun and addictive flash game well worth the price you're paying for it.I have already put more hours in this simple little flash of 5 euros full priced than in a ''Next-gen revolutionary'' game.The gameplay is easy to learn and understand and the later levels are always challenging.But all good things must have a bad side.Once you get an fair amount of items the game starts dropping in framerate which can be a bit frustrating.Also the game can get really easy or really difficult depending on certain item drops.Such as the ''Mom's knife'' and ''Sacred Heart'' combo which basicly allows you to 1-shot almost all enemies in the game (Including bosses).Otherwise it is possible to receive only activateable items which you can only carry 1 of at a time, resulting in getting no proper stats making the game near-impossible to complete.All things set aside I think it's a great game which is fun to play or watch others play.The price can drop below 2 euros during steam sales so if you need a fun game that's easy to pick up, look no further!

												This game... Oh goodness, this game.The basis for this game originates around a small story in the bible, where Abraham is told to kill his son, as an act of obedience; His son's name, of course is Isaac. Upon almost achieving this goal, an angel stops him, letting him know it was merely a test. It is known as one of the most controversial bits of the bible, so I assume that's what sparked the creator's desire to make this game.Your journey begins when your mother hears a voice from ""god"", asking a sacrifice of her son to prove her faith. Isaac hides by dropping into a newly found trapdoor and finds himself in the dangerous pit of the basement. There, he finds what could have been, and what probably will be.This saddening and dark atmosphere is lightened by it's sadistic power-up lineup and cartoony artwork. Items you can grab will give you benefits and change how your character looks, often leading to some crude jokes. Terrifying bosses aren't always this game's goal, instead it lets the gameplay do the talking. Often you'll find yourself not properly equipped to face up a certain room or boss. It really drives the helplessness of Isaac home.You can do multiple runs of this game, with each one never being a copy of one before. Sure, the same items have a chance of appearing, but it ultimately feels like it's own unique run. You may be doomed from the start, or destined for victory; It all depends on your skill and luck.The Wrath of the Lamb DLC provides a whopping amount of content. It introduces a new item type, adds new mobs, new floors and bosses, the works. It's essentially a new game.This game is worth the full $8 to experience it all. Try it out yourself, you won't be disappointed!9.3/10 (Buy it. Now.) - WolfHero			"

												If Charles Manson played this game, he would definitely give it a 10/10What twisted minds did the developers of The Binding of Isaac have. How disturbing is a mother trying to kill her son who escaped to the basement, and can kill anything with his tears. Exploring the basement, you come across all sorts of horrendous monsters, decapitated cats’ heads, piles of faeces lying around and of course, your mother’s pads...among many other disturbing things.However once you become desensitized, this little game is pretty good. Going through each level, finding power-ups (or power-downs) to help you with the increasingly difficult monsters, ultimately fighting a boss to proceed to the next level of the basement.There is no continuity, so once you die, you start again from the beginning. Everything is randomly generated, so you will never have the same experience twice.It’s a really fun and interesting game, with alot of little references to other games -  You might find a pixelated pickaxe as a power-up, which of course, is Notch's pickaxe. You might come across a monster that spews toxic green acid, just like the one from Left for Dead 2 - and the list goes on.For the price you should certainly try this game out.My rating - 8/10			"

												NOTE: Please buy the 'Wrath of the Lamb' DLC if you're going to get this. It will make TBoI a million times better, and will allow you to update the game to get the Hard Mode.With randomly generated dungeons for every playthrough and a top down dungeon crawling experience in the same vein of the original Zelda trilogy, The Binding of Isaac is a roguelike game that can be picked up for less than a dollar and provides hours and hours of fun on end.Following Isaac, a young boy who is trying to defeat his murderous mother after almost getting killed by her, TBoI has hundreds of items, ranging from the cutest of fashion accessories to the most grotesque parasites and diseases. With a randomisation system that makes no two playthroughs the same, TBoI is an adventure, a big step forward in the world of indie gaming, and ultimately, you'll have a hell of a time playing it.My criticisms with the game are that it's impossible to predict what items you're going to get, and while this adds to the mystery, this also means you can become obscenely OP or obscenely UP and it can become frustrating having to play through with what could be called a dead weight on your leg, which combined with the VERY steep learning curve, makes for a frustrating time with some playthroughs. Nonetheless, with a game that you can pick up for less than one dollar, where can you go wrong? I highly reccommend TBoI, and if you like it, go pick up the remake, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth!

												The Binding of Isaac is a frustratingly-fun and challenging zelda-style rogue-lite, created by Edmund McMillen (Super Meat Boy) and Florian Himsl (Coil, The C-Word).The game features a ton of variables in the forms of characters, bosses, items, and power-ups, all of which can alter how much you progress throughout the game.With hilarious (and sometimes creepy) references to faith, religion, human ethics, and biology, Isaac is a delicious slice of blasphemy, served with a sour lemon.

												The Binding of Isaac is a dark game as you can see in the screenshots. It's very fun (can get out of hand via ER MAH GERD). Can  be quite tricky and trust me its worth buying. Only $5 so super cheap for a game that is really good. NOTE: for all christians out there DO NOT buy this game because it includes Demons, the seven sins from the bible and your mum heard a voice of god saying to kill Isaac but if you want it, you have been warned! But still great game, I crafted the badge because it was great and I think i'll give it 10/10. This game was outstanding with the design in levels. Worth buying so get your wallets out and add $5 to steam and buy it!			"

												Despite the fun and animaded visual of the game its most disturbisg. The story itself about a religious mother who drives insane and try to kill her son, and then the creatures that the kid see in the world in his basement. Its amazing all the ideas that flows throw the monsters and the game.			"

												What can be said of this game? It's fantastic, the art style is cute if not disturbing, which fits the tone of the game, which puts you in the mindset of a child and how they see their fears and such. The game itself isn't too long, but it doesn't need to be, its short and sweet, but also challening and rewarding, this is one game you can play over 100 times over.If your any way a fan of challenging games, top down shooters and enjoy game that are different, you'll enjoy this alot.

												The Binding of Isaac is a roguelike indie game devloped by Edmund McMillen, which I have owned for a few years. It presents a unique stoyline, focusing around Isaac, a small boy who it is presumed wishes for his mother's affection. As the game has a heavy religion focus, a god speaks to his mother with the order to end Isaac's life. Isaac, fearful of his mother finds a hidden trapdoor in his room, and delves into the depths of what is under the house. The game itself is mainly skill based, but partially luck based. Certain combinations of items can ensure an easy and victorious playthrough while other item comboes make a challenging and tedious one.  It contains endless tilesets aswell as a total of 11 different settings along with 7 characters. This game is insanely fun, and provides a testament to your dodging skills. There are many more positive things I can say about this game, but I advise you pick it up and find out yourself ;)			"

												I played the ever living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game. Pretty nice dungeon crawler that has Zelda 1 like dungeons that are different each time you play, but still keeps some things similiar. The difficulty sure is a challenge and very entertaining. because each playthrough is different, this game has a high replayability value. Also you unlock multiple characters with different abilities. The DLC is worth every cent too and the Soundtrack is fantastic.What i personally dislike however is the giant overuse of internet references and memes, the game tries a little too often to be funny without actually coming uo with real humor, mostly just relying on internet memes from 8 years ago.Great game nonetheless, can recommend this one.

												The Binding of Isaac is a dark game as you can see in the screenshots. It's very fun (can get out of hand via ER MAH GERD). Can  be quite tricky and trust me its worth buying. Only $5 so super cheap for a game that is really good. NOTE: for all christians out there DO NOT buy this game because it includes Demons, the seven sins from the bible and your mum heard a voice of god saying to kill Isaac but if you want it, you have been warned! But still great game, I crafted the badge because it was great and I think i'll give it 10/10. This game was outstanding with the design in levels. Worth buying so get your wallets out and add $5 to steam and buy it!			"

												This game... Oh goodness, this game.The basis for this game originates around a small story in the bible, where Abraham is told to kill his son, as an act of obedience; His son's name, of course is Isaac. Upon almost achieving this goal, an angel stops him, letting him know it was merely a test. It is known as one of the most controversial bits of the bible, so I assume that's what sparked the creator's desire to make this game.Your journey begins when your mother hears a voice from ""god"", asking a sacrifice of her son to prove her faith. Isaac hides by dropping into a newly found trapdoor and finds himself in the dangerous pit of the basement. There, he finds what could have been, and what probably will be.This saddening and dark atmosphere is lightened by it's sadistic power-up lineup and cartoony artwork. Items you can grab will give you benefits and change how your character looks, often leading to some crude jokes. Terrifying bosses aren't always this game's goal, instead it lets the gameplay do the talking. Often you'll find yourself not properly equipped to face up a certain room or boss. It really drives the helplessness of Isaac home.You can do multiple runs of this game, with each one never being a copy of one before. Sure, the same items have a chance of appearing, but it ultimately feels like it's own unique run. You may be doomed from the start, or destined for victory; It all depends on your skill and luck.The Wrath of the Lamb DLC provides a whopping amount of content. It introduces a new item type, adds new mobs, new floors and bosses, the works. It's essentially a new game.This game is worth the full $8 to experience it all. Try it out yourself, you won't be disappointed!9.3/10 (Buy it. Now.) - WolfHero			"

												If Charles Manson played this game, he would definitely give it a 10/10What twisted minds did the developers of The Binding of Isaac have. How disturbing is a mother trying to kill her son who escaped to the basement, and can kill anything with his tears. Exploring the basement, you come across all sorts of horrendous monsters, decapitated cats’ heads, piles of faeces lying around and of course, your mother’s pads...among many other disturbing things.However once you become desensitized, this little game is pretty good. Going through each level, finding power-ups (or power-downs) to help you with the increasingly difficult monsters, ultimately fighting a boss to proceed to the next level of the basement.There is no continuity, so once you die, you start again from the beginning. Everything is randomly generated, so you will never have the same experience twice.It’s a really fun and interesting game, with alot of little references to other games -  You might find a pixelated pickaxe as a power-up, which of course, is Notch's pickaxe. You might come across a monster that spews toxic green acid, just like the one from Left for Dead 2 - and the list goes on.For the price you should certainly try this game out.My rating - 8/10			"

												The binding of Isaac is a brilliant little procedurally generated dungeon crawler in which you must make it through each level of your toy box in order to defeat your mother. This game recquires huge levels of concentration and multi-tasking as you'll be ducking around to avoid flies and enemy tears. This game however is not as innocent as it looks though as if you fail or make the slightest mistake it may come back to bite you later when you need just the tinniest part of health. Anyway this game is an amazing sign of just what a small group of people can achieve and you can see to this day that edmund mcmillin has created many of amazing games. This game is perfect for when your kicking back and want just a small dose of this game or want to play hardcore. This is brilliant, I'm giving it a 7.5/10			"

The Binding of Isaac is a two-dimensional Action-adventure Roguelike game, which preforms amazingly well in it's Genre. I will breakdown the components of the game:Story - 9/10The Binding of Isaac's storyline is based off the eponymous Bible story. Isaac (a kid) and his mother live in a small home situated on a hill, both peacefully keeping to themselves, with Isaac drawing doodles and playing with his toys while his mother watches Christian broadcasts on the television. Isaac's mother then hears ""a voice from above"", stating her son is corrupted and must be helped. It asks her to remove all sin from Isaac to save him. She obliges, and takes away his toys, games and even clothes.The voice again calls out to Isaac's mother, stating Isaac must be isolated from all the evil in the world. Once again, she follows its command and locks Isaac in his room. Finally, the voice speaks to her again, and tells her that she has done good, but it still questions her faith and commands she must sacrifice Isaac. She obliges, grabbing a kitchen knife and goes to Isaac's room. Isaac is watching through a sizable crack in his door and starts to panic. He finds a trapdoor under the rug, and just as his mother bursts in, he opens the trapdoor and jumps down it. Isaac then puts the paper he was drawing onto his wall, which transitions into the game's title screen.The game has multiple endings, all pointing at different ideas about Isaac's life.Gameplay - 10/10The ingame dungeons are procedurally generated, allowing endless hours of entertainment. It also includes random bosses from a list of over 20, 100+ powerups and items, and 50+ different types of enemies.Sound - 8/10TBOI has a great soundtrack and amazing background music which is highly attractive and creates a great atmosphere in this bizarre game.Overall - 9/10 FYI: I have played a lot more of this game than said by Steam as I have played the DRM free version.

												tldr:6/10 - A rather mediocre top-down rogue action game with dark humor. I keep returning to it when I have a minute and I don't feel like doing anything complex or time consuming. Would absolutely skip if it wasn't on sale. Still very recommended at a reasonable price if you're looking for a simple casual game which is easy to get into.too long part:STORY - ?/10You're playing as Isaac - a little kid whose mom is nuts and wants to kill him, so he descends through a trap door in his room to fight his way through creepy places with creepy monsters in them.GAMEPLAY - 6/10- Simple but hard to master controls. Depends on anyones taste.- The game has its own economy and a SH*TLOAD of upgrades, active skills and consumables to be discovered. Each upgrade and skill is very interesting and fun to mess around with. While it's tempting to google what does what, it's way better fun to just pick something up and see what it does.- Levels are randomized and there is a lot of various monsters and bosses to spice things up. You won't play the game the same way twice. From this point of view the game offers infinite replayability, but...- The fact that everything is so heavily randomized prevents you from forming any sort of your own strategy. You just dive in and keep going until you win or die. Over time, this reduces the cool variety to the point where you're doing the same thing over and over again and it's only a liiiiiiiittle bit different because of some dice roll. - There is not much persistence to keep you returning for more. There are few unlockable characters and mandatory achievements but upgrades and skills are limited for each run where you find them. While it's nice to know that the game doesn't have you on a leash trying to unlock everything, it doesn't really motivate you to achieve anything when you start from zero every single time.			"

												In this game, you play as Isaac, a child who is terrified of his mother. Mainly because she has heard some ""divine voices"" that she claims to be God, that are telling her to kill you. As a consequence, you jump into your own basement, scared of your own mother, who has cornered you. In your basement, plagued with weird monsters like flies that shoot blood and spooky skeletons. What do you do to defend yourself from these monsters? That's right, you kill them. With your tears. Your tears.This game has the weirdest story of any game I have played yet, by far. But all jokes aside, it's a great game that offers a wide range of achievements for any hunter out there. The rogue-like action apparently based on early Zelda games is great, and the DLC only makes the game much more enjoyable, long, and about ten times harder. I would reccomend this game to anyone with a few hours (or days) to spare, looking for an enjoyable way to kill time.			"

												If you liked Super Meat Boy, you'll love this game. The art style and punishing roguelike difficulty are attributed to the geniuses that are Edmund McMillen (of Team Meat) and Florian Himsl. The game is accompanied by the beautiful musical stylings of Danny Baranowsky (who also scored Super Meat Boy). Imagine Legend of Zelda, dungeons only, one life, with a dark, ""cute-grotesque"" art style. The more you play, the more items you'll be able to use. The more times you complete the game, the further you can progress. I can not recommend this game enough. Continually patched to add new things and fix bugs. The replayability is endless.			"

												Isaac and his Mother lived alone in a small house on a hill.Isaac kept to himself, drawing pictures and playing with his toys, as his Mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television.Life was simple, and they were both happy.That was, until the day Isaac's Mom heard a voice, from above.""Your son has become corrupted by sin! He needs to be saved!""""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's Mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life.Again, the voice called to her:""Isaac's soul is still corrupt! He needs to be cut off from all that is evil,and confess his sins!""""I will follow your instructions, Lord! I have faith in thee!"" Isaac's Motherreplied, as she locked Isaac away in his room, away from all the evils of the world.One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her:""You have done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to me!To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you.""""Yes lord. Anything!"" Isaac's mother begged.""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice.Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice.Go into his room, and end his life, as an offering to me to prove you love me above all else.""""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen.Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear.Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trap door to the Basement, hidden under his rug.Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, just as his mother burst through his door, and threw himself down, into the unknown depths below.And thus begins one of the best games I've ever played, on Steam or otherwise.In this game you play as Isaac (or one of 6 other characters who may or may not also be Isaac in different costumes, depending on your interpretation of the endings) and go through randomized floors of the Basement (and the caves, and depths, and maybe even beyond!), collecting all sorts of weird/gross powerups to eventually face-off your Mother.Even if you've played Rebirth, I'd recommend you pick this up, if only just to see where it all began.It doesn't run perfectly (since it was programmed in Flash it's capped at 30FPS, but if you're on a toaster like me, that might be more than you get on rebirth!The soundtrack is superb (and personally better than rebirth's soundtrack IMO), and the graphics just kind of work (it looks like it's all part of Isaac's drawings, which according to the first ending, it is)Pros:-Harder than Rebirth (due to mechanics changes and a lack of SUPER op items that aren't extremely rare to compensate for their power)-10/10 soundtrack (even just opening it up today i found myself subconsiously humming the title screen music!)-Spooky, but in a good way (ie subtlety, and not hamfisted jumpscares)-Replayability (especially with the new ""Eternal Edition"" update, I still haven't been able to beat some of those new bosses)Neutral:-Different styled boss fights than Rebirth (while Rebirth has a lot of bullet hell-type fights, BoI has more mechanical fights, for example, instead of shooting bullet hell patterns like in Rebirth, the 'true' final boss will shoot at you only when you shoot, matching your fire rate, and some bosses like Carrion Queen are more about dodging the ground hazards while making sure to hit her weak point. Some people may prefer it, some may not, it's mostly a matter of personal preference)Cons:-Fewer item synergies than Rebirth (Brimstone doesn't really synergize with anything aside from generic tear effects, Mom's Knife SORTA works with Spoon Bender and other similar effects i can't remember the name of in that the knife sorta wiggles in the direction of enemies, but mostly just keeps its same trajectory)-Lower framerate -No controller support (unless you use Joy2Key)One thing to keep in mind if you havent played it before, is that Wrath of the Lamb actually makes the game harder (by giving you a random chance to get alternate, harder versions of floors, and various curses that can help/hinder you), so if you're playing for the first time, you may not want to get the DLC right away, at least not until you've beaten the game a few times to unlock stuff.Also, you won't want hard mode on unless you're experienced with this game.Normal mode in this is equivalent to hard mode in Rebirth, so it's already decently hard.Overall i definitely recommend this, you basically have no excuse not to pick this up if it's on sale because the price gets pretty low, and if you're like me you'll probably end up with a ton of time in this game (ignore my steam played stats, a lot of my progress was offline or using SpiderMod/Community Remix mod, which is why i'm missing a few achievements and still have platinum god)			"

												Twisted comedy, endless replayability and hundrads of upgrades make the Binding of Issac one of my most played games. It is a dark twisted roguelike mixed with a layout lifted from the original zelda leading to simple controlls and easy to learn concepts with an ochean of underlieing complexity. Due to its random nature no two runs are the same and while I cant say the Asthetic is for everyone, if you are even slightly interested i would strongly suggest you give it a whirl.			"

												64 hours of nightmare... I think I'm lucky to beat this game to 100% in 64 hours. I don't even know, should I recommend this game? I think I should. The Binding of Isaac, an amazing roguelike game. The game's mechanics and presentation is similar to the dungeons of The Legend of Zelda, while incorporating random, procedurally-generated levels. Every room you enter, you must clear it if you wanna get outta there or put a bomb in front of the door that will do it too. Each floor of the dungeon includes a boss which you must defeat before continuing to the next level. Oh yeah, they have item rooms too. You can unlock new characters if you can get some achievements. This game has a lotta religious refences, oh wait, not only refences this games is about the Christianity. We can say that I suppose. So, this is the best roguelike, dungeon crawler game I've ever played. I can't wait for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. I'm ready for it! Buy this game and prepare yourself for Rebirth! Oh I almost forgot, this is a flash game so you know what it means. Whatever, just buy it!			"

												If this game were a potato, it would be a pain-inducing, tear jerking, fly-spamming, guppy-destroying, lamb-wrathing, bloody-tearing, time-intensive potato. In other words, it's a well baked potato, with just enough bacon, and cheddar on the side to keep you entertained, with just a touch of that good ol' old-school feel that lots of games are lacking. You WILL die, that is not an option. And most likely it will be by the cold, cruel clutches of a fly.			"

												I have had this game for around 2 years now and oh my god do i love it, When i lost my internet for over a year this game was the main reason i stayed sane, regardless of the fact steam says i have about 240 hours clocked on the game in actual fact it is closer to 1500 hours.The first ever time i played this game i hated it, i despised its difficulty and lack of explination for the items. It wasnt untill i didnt play it for about a week after my first time that i started to feel an urge to play it again ( it doesnt help that i was watching a lot of streams of a guy who played it a lot) and this time when i went back to the game i found my self enjoying the game, yeah i was still dieing a hella load ( i think i had around 40 deaths before i killed moms foot for the first time) but i wasnt raging about it, i was just thinking "" huh so thats what this little bugger does well imma getcha next time mister""  and with the randomness of the items and the lackj of explination of what they do, i felt my self enjoying finding new items and figuring out what they do on my own, like an adventure, it was a sad day when i knew what all the items and trinkets and cards did.  For those who are checking this game out because of rebirth i highly recommend you get  this game and play it first, it is a great way to get the feel how the game plays and what it was like before we got them fancy pancy 16 bit graphicsReveiw word of the day : Randomness			"

												At first, you start a new game and die. Then, you restart, and die again. But each time you start a new run, you know more, you have more experience and have more stuff unlocked. So, with a bit of luck (as levels are generated randomly), you can progress further. Your runs are longer, you die later, you reach lower levels of the basement and discover more and more of the secrets (and there are plenty of them, believe me).Very addictive and rewarding game, I don't think I've ever played a game in which dying was so motivating to start all over again.

												Edmund McMillen is a freaking genius, Part 2. (For Redux version go here.)'Isaac' is simply the best rogue-like I've ever played. Even with slightly more rogue-like experience under my belt now, I still love to go back to this game. It sets the bar freaking high.Released just under a year after Super Meat Boy, with a jumbo DLC expansion another year after that, the game plays like a top-down dungeon-crawler-shooter with randomised levels - no 2 playthroughs are exactly the same! (Unless you use a certain program that can pull the map seeds, but that's a different story.)The base game itself was very good, difficult at first but gets slightly easier as you unlock the more OP items and collectibles. The DLC adds a ton more content. Not to say that the items take away from the difficulty of the game though - some levels with the new Wrath monsters (and quite a few of the old monsters as well) feel somewhat akin to bullet curtain-like games.The only real gripe I have with this is that I cannot save my game mid-way! It's still a small flaw, and one that is corrected in its remake, 'The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth'. :)In the meantime, to circumvent this during super epic games, I recommend hibernating your computer with the game still running. Okay, well, my computer has survived the hibernation, but I'm not sure about yours...Well, okay, one more gripe - the game engine is in Flash, which is laggy at times and hard to play. For the most part though I didn't have any problems or let that detract from the fun of the game.If you can get this and the DLC for a cheap price, a must buy. It has possibly one of the highest ratios of time spent in game to money spent on game. (Excluding F2Ps, of course.)When to buy In May 2015, an all-new hard mode (Edmund M has called it names ranging from ""Trololololol hell mode"" to ""Florian's ♥♥♥♥ You Mod"") was released for owners of the WotL DLC - and it is hard as heck. You'll probably spend a lot of time trying to beat this mode with all characters, even if you are a veteran. Getting it on a steep discount will give you a lot of hours worth of gameplay for your dollar, but even full price for both game and DLC is not such a bad idea - Florian deserves to be rewarded for his new fiendishly unfair eternal manifestations. I genuinely mean that. It got me to re-look at, and re-evaluate, an old game which I thought I was done with.9.5/10 "

												Pretty awesome game here.  This plus the Wrath of the Lamb DLC will provide many many hours of fun.  It takes a decent bit of learning what items do what, and you'll die a lot, but every run is a fresh take with new things thrown at you.  I really enjoy it and like a good challenge, but sometimes you can just get very unlucky with the drops you're given.  On the other hand you can get very lucky and feel overpowered until you go down deep enough and die anyway from a new boss you haven't fought yet.Overall though, pretty great. 9/10			"

												A beautifully made game that is amazing in almost every way. Aside from the fact that you can't save, it is still absolutely wonderful! The graphics, design, randomness of the items and location, and the way it increasingly gets difficult. The Binding of Issac pulls you in. It is like an addiction that cannot be satisfied until the game is beaten, and the way that you cannot save just fuels the addiction more to beat the game. Imagine being on the last level fighting against the boss. You are left with only half a heart left and the boss with only less then 6% of health. Almost to the end you get hit. You die. Game over.Time to restart... Again.			"

												This game is so amazing. It looks really boring to people, but they don't understand. This game is so creative, and challenging! You expect so little of it, but it's just a huge game with so many moments that make you go crazy and so many moments that make you so excited and giggly. There are items that can touch you, personally, and they all have their own meaning. Each boss is different and the further you progress the harder they get. It has so much replay-ability as well! I got Platinum God recently, and it's still fun to play! The Binding of Isaac is by far, my favorite game on Steam, and maybe even my favorite game ever. You really should get it, it's such a journey, and it's so cheap. I can't wait for Rebirth, it's going to be AMAZING, just like this is.			"

												A really fun game.  You play as a young child who constantly gets bullied by his mother.  He is ridiculed at school and everyone around him defecates on him.  The goal of this game is to progress through floors of your basement in order to kill your mum - the big poo monster.  It is fun to just chill in your house and play.  There is a wide range of items to collect in the game which help you on a run such as trinkets or cards.  There are also 5 characters other than Isaac which are unlocked via various methods.  Overall I would give this an 8.5/10.  The music and visuals are brilliant.  The levels are randomly generated to some extent.  The one downside to me would be that it gets repetitive but the range of characters can make up for it.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is by far my favorite game of all time. The gameplay  is smooth, with a bit of lag from here to there, but that really doesn't matter. Level floors are randomly generated. So many unique items, and such different ways to play. Besides Isaac there are six different characters to play as, each having there own pros and cons. The game is also mac compatible, which is great. The game is only 5.00 and the DLC is 3.00 dollars. I am amazed on how well Edmund McMillen did with this game and I can't wait for the remake!			"

												This game is great. There is a grotesque atmosphere when it comes to the games contents, but the controls are easy and quick to learn. Fans of the gameboy versions of Zelda will find this game to be very enjoyable. There are many similarities between the two games. The game is like a series of dungeons. Each time you beat the dungeon you get one of over 250 power ups. There is a lot of replayability in the game because of the different variations of power ups you can have. Each time you play, it is like starting with a new hero. You just have to make use of what you stumble upon.			"

You shoot ♥♥♥♥ing tears at dead children, fat worms, and the HORSEMEN OF THE MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING APOCOLYPSE. You can find items to increase your stats, and Isaac uses them accordingly. For ♥♥♥♥ing example; you find a coat hanger? He sticks it in his head. (As you ♥♥♥♥ing do) You find a noose? He becomes a floating head. You find drugs? You take them. Isaac can become a ♥♥♥♥ing flying head with a nun hood on, sticks keeping his eyes open, demon horns, and have four eyes. If that isn't metal as ♥♥♥♥ then I don't even know WHAT ♥♥♥♥ING IS.Oh, and I haven't even begun on the ♥♥♥♥ing story. This ♥♥♥♥ing kid has a psycho religious mother who wants to kill him because ♥♥♥♥ing god told her to. But that's only the start. There are MULTIPLE ENDINGS TO THIS SWEET♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

The Binding of Isaac. A flash semi-bullet hell satirical game on Christianity.The story goes that you are a young child named Isaac whom is stripped of fun and enjoyment in simple life after Mother has heard the voice of God demand that all things sin is removed. Hearing His one last wish from the high heavens, Mother grabs a knife and traps Isaac in his room, his only escape being a trapdoor leading below the foundation of the house. One powerful bash through the door and down goes the poor child.The objective of the game is the clear any rooms you enter of monstrosities that lie in your way as you travel deeper and deeper in the depths of your own basement, or maybe a cellar; crawling around the caves and catacombs, throughout the Depths of Nercopolis; and facing the one they call... Mom! Along the way, you find pick-ups, items, tarot cards, and pills that could do good or could do harm to Isaac as you take him on a somewhat sad (but fun!) venture to escape.ReviewThe GoodThough I had originally thought this game was kinda sad, I eventually got it, played it, and actually found myself excited over playing it over and over, unlocking a variety of cool items and using sweet powers. Aside from Isaac, you can also play other characters that have different starter abilites (ex. Magdalene, Cain, Eve), each unlocking a new item with every successful playthrough. If you add in the Wrath of the Lamb DLC, there are also challenges that start you out with preset powers and curses--another method of unlocking fantastic pick-ups.The BadIt is possible that anything kinda bad in this game were cleared up in the ""sequel,"" Rebirth. (This portion of the review will be edited at a later time.)Concluding CommentsSeeing everyone (at one point) playing this game persuaded me to make an attempt to give it a go, and I do not at all regret making such a decision. The Binding of Isaac is an excellent action game that deserves the amount of support it has gotten. And Rebirth has done great justice. --Hermix.			"

												I've never play ""The legend of Zelda"" games but I know that this game is based on it (and many other games). I must admit it's fun to play it and even better if you have the DLC. What's weird though is that I have religious feeling while playing it. It's plot is... I don't even have words to describe it. Anyway I recommend it to you guys because it has a nice gameplay.			"

												Holy. ♥♥♥♥ing.♥♥♥♥♥♥Look at this game. You see that ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ You see how much ♥♥♥♥ing content it has? That♥♥♥♥♥♥is built in mother♥♥♥♥ing FLASH. If that isn't dope as ♥♥♥♥ then get the hell out of this room.Go on, door is over there.Right, now we got rid of all the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ let's talk about the mother♥♥♥♥ing gameplay.This game is like the first Zelda on ♥♥♥♥ing crack. You shoot ♥♥♥♥ing tears at dead children, fat worms, and the HORSEMEN OF THE MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING APOCOLYPSE. You can find items to increase your stats, and Isaac uses them accordingly. For ♥♥♥♥ing example; you find a coat hanger? He sticks it in his head. (As you ♥♥♥♥ing do) You find a noose? He becomes a floating head. You find drugs? You take them. Isaac can become a ♥♥♥♥ing flying head with a nun hood on, sticks keeping his eyes open, demon horns, and have four eyes. If that isn't metal as ♥♥♥♥ then I don't even know WHAT ♥♥♥♥ING IS.Oh, and I haven't even begun on the ♥♥♥♥ing story. This ♥♥♥♥ing kid has a psycho religious mother who wants to kill him because ♥♥♥♥ing god told her to. But that's only the start. There are MULTIPLE ENDINGS TO THIS SWEET♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. YOU HAVE TO FINISH THE GAME MULTIPLE ♥♥♥♥ING TIMES TO FIND MORE OF THE STORY. You might be thinking it's stupid to replay the same game, but trust me you critical piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ no two playthroughs are the same. In one playthrough, a stupid ♥♥♥♥ing fly might kill you. In another, you might take down mother♥♥♥♥ing SATAN.This game is so ♥♥♥♥ing crazy and fun that I think I just died. NOW STOP STALLING AND BUY IT YOU ♥♥♥♥ER			"

It seems like such a simple & disgusting package, but you'll soil your knickers a second time once you realise how much depth is being brought forward. Quit thinking about it and buy it already. It costs nothing at all. Just bear in mind that this is a hardcore platformer and you will not complete it any time soon. "

												I know what you're thinking, ""What the hell is he saying?"" It's true that we've had so many biographies about presidents in which some of the movies told about historic incidents, why not have a fictional president that could kick♥♥♥♥♥and take names? Harrison Ford is the man for the job.""The Binding of Isaac"" is a thriller that involves Russian terrorist Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) and his gang of criminals hijacking the first plane along with the president's wife and child and his staff. Meanwhile, President James Marshall (Harrison Ford) is hiding after an attack on the ship where he must reunite with his family before they end up victims to Ivan's plan if the president doesn't release a Russian prisoner who happens to be a general and a terrorist.The film itself is a nail bitter thriller with an all star cast as Ford and Oldman play their usual good guy/villain roles with Glenn Close, Wendy Crewson, Xander Berkerly and William H. Macy in supporting roles. If there was such thing where Harrison Ford had a nomination for president, I would vote.			"

												The Binding of Isaac. Top down shooter roguelike dungeon crawler shoot em up, wakka wakka other stuff. If you're into games with lots of RNG and a bit of skill as well as a healthy dose of morbidity then you'll probably want to pick this up.This game has some pretty solid controls, stylized artwork and great gameplay, but it's a flash game and as a result doesn't run super dooper well even if you have a beast machine.The basic plot is that you're a child and your momma is tryina keel ya. You jump in the basement...which the entrance is apparently in your room...and you go around killing the abominations that your mom apparently keeps stored down there. I can't really say much else as far as that goes because it would spoil the game...kind of...although that's pretty much it. Along the way you pick up random♥♥♥♥♥♥lying around and ♥♥♥♥ yourself up with it. Literally. At one point you'll probably get the coat hanger and jam it through your skull. I think the whole self mutilation thing is the most interesting aspect of the game because it's not overly done and it's an interesting way to 'upgrade' your character. It's visually fun to upgrade so to say.There's also a plethora of unlockables including different characters and mushrooms and alternate endings. This game has over 10 endings...shame they all suck. As far as that goes, most of the endings are generic 'unlock' endings and then some weird music. The ones that aren't unlock endings are 'left to speculation' which in my opinion is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way to be a lazy writer.The controls are simply. AWSD to move and Cursor keys(or mouse) to shoot. Shift drops a bomb and space uses items. Real simple and well implemented. No problems here.Each time you start a playthrough the rooms are randomly organized, but will always be square. The games not 'fully randomized' but follows the generic 'procedurally generated' system with pre built rooms that are randomly arranged with random monsters. Even the monster placement is static, but that's so the game isn't an♥♥♥♥♥to you and have a monster spawn on top of you I guess.Another great aspect is the soundtrack. It fits very well into the game with a series of 'darker' themed tracks. The best track is ultimately the final few bosses of course, but the rest really set the mood.There are quite a few uppies for this game and not a whole lot of downies.Uppies:Solid controls.Interesting graphics and graphical concepts(upgrading yourself by mutilating yourself).Great soundtrack.RNG is well put together.Fairly well balanced game.Memorable enemies and upgrades/items.Good AI (not great, just good).Downies:Overarching plot is lazy and overal just lame.Level design is bland even for a game that's supposed to be dark and dreary. (Just because it's supposed to be horror doesn't mean you can't have a ♥♥♥♥ING FOREST. SPLATTERHOUSE HAD A FOREST LEVEL AND IT HAD WATER.)Unique bosses are mostly just reskins.And that's it! This game was worth about 15 bucks to me, but you'll likely get it around 2.50 if you buy it on sale. I feel it's definitely worth the 5 bucks. As far as the expansion, it's more DLC oriented as it's 'more of the same', but it's cheap and also worth it IMO.			"

												One of the first games i bought when I got my new PC, and it exceeded all expectations. It can be very challenging, but to me it has near infinite replayability.Most people compare it to any of the top down zelda games, but taking place 100% in the dungeons. What makes this better is the dark humor, the hundreds of items, the unlockable playable characters, and as i said before the replayabiltiy due to the randomly generated levels. Definitly worth $5, but its on sale for less than $2 a lot of the time and anyone would be stupid to pass it up at that price.			"

												Binding of Isaac is a great example of a well-executed indie title that marries interestingly odd and obscure art and story references with engaging twitch-reflex  gameplay. It's essentially a twin-stick shooter with power ups set in an unique dungeon environment. It has numerous rogue-like elements as well. It's lacking resolutions higher than 720P, and when in Windowed mode it plays in a 4:3 square that looks fairly small on a 1080 screen. While in fullscreen mode, you cannot access the Steam overlay. Other than few minor gripes listed above, this is a fun little rogue-like twin-stick-style adventure shooter set in a level-by-level dungeon design.			"

												I'll be honest. When I first saw this game I thought that it was one of the most stupid things I had ever seen. The artstyle looked childish to me and I found that it didn't match the dark atmosphere of the rest of the game. The fact that the main character is constantly crying seemed absurd and the gameplay looked boring and unappealing.But daaaamn was I wrong.Once you get the hang of the game mechanics (which may take a few hours) you'll really get addicted to it. There is so much to find out, so many different enemies, so many secrets, so many items with so many different effects.Each run is truly unique and the combat has an unexpected depth to it so that you will get constantly better which is again very motivating and fun.The game is difficult (at the beginning at least) and it is a bit of luck involved but that just adds to the uniqueness of every run and makes it even more satisfying when you get good items and have good run.The soundtrack is also just glorious and fits the creepy atmosphere perfectly.And the artstyle...you'll learn to love it. It may look very peculiar at the beginning but with the sick character design and the soundtrack it creates a very morbid experience which pulls you in again and again.It's easily the best rogue-like game I've ever played and it may just be the best out there.If you are intrested I suggest just give it a try. It's cheap, so you can't go wrong. It really has a lot more to offer then it seems and chances are high that, despite the first impression, you will fall in love with it.			"

Run, Fight, Die, Repeat!In a few words, this would be the game. It's a weird rogue like, quite addictive little game. It's one of the few games where getting an achievement actually helps in-game, the majority of them are unlocking new items, items that you might or might not need in your ""dungeon"" exploring. Filled with a variety of items, which give you new powers and new aesthetics as well, every time getting randomized, one gameplay in 100 isn't even nearly the same, despite having the same levels, the maps and items are always random, but you could slowly but surly start figuring out some patterns, despite having a minimalistic tutorial at the start, you will be on your own after room 1. The whole game is a combination of LUCK and SKILL, both of them which are raised by EXPERIENCE (actually playing and replaying the game), it also involves some currency/item management and some though decisions, despite the lack of an actual inventory, you will gamble your way to the top or you will play it safe, the decision is yours.WARNING: The game uses flash, not just once it happened to me that the game would crash due to high number of powerups/items picked up during the gameplay, resulting to a laggy/crashy gameplay. I played it a while ago, I heard of an upcoming new version, not sure if they updated or fixed the current one.In rest, nothing bad that I could say about it, except that you will probably die a lot and it has good ambiental music.

												I bought this game for 1$ and was quite amazed about how interesting it was. Basically, you play Isaac and have to defeat ennemies and bosses in various rooms. You kill ennemies by shooting them with your tears or by ""bombing"" them. This game is a ""rogue-like"" : you go through doors, not knowing what you'll get, and have to find the bosses in the various different floors, along with the ""item-rooms"" that level-up your tears or give you new abilities.The whole game is RNG, every floor is always randomly generated and this is the main point of the game : no playthrough will be identical, ever, and that's what offers a great replay value.Another important thing : permadeath. If you die in this game, you have to start back at the beginning  (with another layout of course, since everything is RNG), and trust me, you'll die often. But each time you die, you learn from your mistakes and make better the next time. At the beginning, you'll be happy if you reach level 5, but at the end, reaching level 8 is quite normal. (Note : if you unlock new item, death doesn't affect that)[Pros] : + RNG all around the place = infinite replay value+ 2 minutes to get the point of the game and the controlls, 200 hours to fully master it+ A ton of items and stuff, you will learn something new at each playthrough and get better and better+ Items have synergies and can be ""combined"" for powerful results+ Awesome price for awesome game (under 1$ in sale)+ Will train your reflexes, strategy and learning abilities + Cool graphic style+ You can make it work smoothly even on a potato computer+ Simple controls : WASD to move, Arrows to Shoot, E to Bomb, Space to Use Item, Q to use Pill/Card ; that's all.+ A ton of ""secrets"" to master to get better+ ""Humoristic"" items with Internet Memes References (Lemon, Hoop de Loop, Forever Alone, Super Meat Boy...)[Cons] : - Hard at the beginning, can be very frustrating if you don't like the ""learn by mistakes"" approach (=/= die and retry)- The game engine can lag sometimes, the game isn't fully oprimized- Don't hope beating the ""last"" boss with under 60 hours of /played (but the game is fun even if you never finish it)- RNG land, sometimes, you'll get f*** up hard by bad RNG[Conslusion] : Anyone that is ok with games that involve reflexes should try this, at least if it's in sale for less than 1 buck. 10/10 "

												So basicly long story short here i'm playing COD:GHOSTS and my PC decides to get sum errors and it crashed so I call Geek Squad in to fix it and lo and behold it ends up taking about 11 hours to fix so i'm on my ipad thinking hey I could use a cool gamme to hold me over until I can beef up my KDR som e more so browsing the steam front page best sellers I see this gemOK actual review starts nowSo yeah obviously I was drawn to this game becuase judging by the graphix this game can DEF. run on lower end rigs/tablets which was perfect for me. Gameplay wise it's great you basicaly press 4-5 buttons at the monsters and theres blood and humour ha the maps could be better, def. expected more especially after playing a game like COD GHOSTS but they're ok for this indie bit. I hear there are people who play thsi game for like a lot of hours 60+ and are reely into it and its like lol go outside or just take a trip to gamestop XD Overall this game is a lot of fun so I give The Binding of Isaac a FIVEout of Five :)			"

												How to some up this game... Imagine you are in a Tim Burton world, such as ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", and you have to kill monsters and demons as a little pink kid. If you like the sound of that, then this game is for you. If you dont like Tim Burton, then this game is not for you, and there must be something wrong with your head.			"

												note: I played this mostly offline, and have put considerably more than 4 hours into it.I know it's not a popular opinion, but I really don't like the Binding of Isaac. There are a lot of things to like about it, most notably the wonderfully grotesque design, but I personally hate the core mechanics. I really really tried to love it (largely because it was a game that was easy to play on the bus), but eventually gave up.Ok, so Binding of Isaac is a rogue-like, so we already know you're going to be dying and restarting a lot. That doesn't bother me. What does bother me is that you don't get better with each subsequent death. There's no lineage system or inventory hold over that helps you make a little more progress with each new game, you are just literally starting from scratch each time. And the controls are not complicated, so there isn't even an element of mastering the game's mechanics as progression.And then there's other major design decision that I hate, the complete randomness. Procedurally generated games can be a ton of fun and help to keep things interesting, but your success in each run of this game is largely decided before you even leave the first room. The enemies being random is great, it keeps things from being rote. However, the power-ups being random is a huge problem because of the disparity between them. Power-ups can be utterly worthless, or god-tier, and you never know what you're going to go get. But because your previous attempts don't have any impact, you're relying entirely on the much necessary power-ups, which are sometimes just going to be useless.One of my best runs was actually one of my first. In one of the first rooms I picked up a power-up that just devastated every enemy I came across. I've never been that lucky again. I enjoy challenging games, but there needs to be some sort of progression either through leveling or mastery of the mechanics, and Binding of Isaac has neither. There are of course going to be minor improvements to how you play, but for the most part, your 100th attempt has just as much chance of success as your 2nd attempt, and it's going to be based on what procedural roll you got. While this clearly doesn't deter most people, I find it to be an uninteresting set of mechanics that generally lead to wasting time on a run that was doomed to fail.			"

												A fun place to rage. Well, it did well to me atleast.Everytime you start a game, you wish you would survive till the end.Every floor are randomly-generated with random power ups, you wish to get hold all of them.When tear away through all the rooms and find something you like, you killed by a freaking fly.10/10 would rage everytime i see a fly.

												The Binding of Isaac is a micro dungeon crawler and expands itself the more runs you put into the game. It generates stages in a Zelda: Link to the Past sort of way, with a similair map style. I love the music in this game and the bosses are fun and grotesque. This game was pretty damn tough when I bought it, but it was worth it. It becomes easier and easier to get farther. Linux support would be nice, seeing there is already Mac support but there is no cause to complain. I can't wait for the remake!EDIT: There are saves for this game on YouTube, I lost my save due to lack of cloud support, added a save, got 9 achievements at once. It gave me the characters and such and saved about 40 hours of items I already had collected plus twenty more. In closing the worst fault of this game is easily fixed, if you haven't played it and use this technique I'd advise you not or you'll spoil the entire expierience. At 80 hours I barely have over half the achievements in this game, making it the most replayed game I own. Replay value seems nearly infinite.			"

The Binding of Isaac will suck you into its humorous world, motivating you through failure and actively rewarding you for accomplishments with new items and possibilities every step of the way.  This game is the reason I got a C in statics in college. My buddies and I would play during class.  So don't do that, but you should get this game anyway.  It's worth so much more than $5			"

												First game I ever got on Steam, first game I ever recommend. I suggest that you should get the original game first, then buy the DLC until you beat the boss or until you get bored with it. (I got to at least 120hours of the original game before someone gifted me the DLC. :P) This game is rather addictive, and could be quite ragey too. It's real fun though, and definitely worth the money. (Even better when there's a sale!) Come talk to me if you don't agree with this recommendation, I might need to knock some sense into you. <3			"

												Binding of isaac is yet antoher amazing game made by Edmun Mcmillen which brings a legend of zelda esk kind of gameplay to PC/STEAM! This game consists of the protagonist, Isaac to travel through the depths below his house to prevent his mom from killing him. As short as the scenario is, the game is outstanding!!! And the fact that they're making a re-make of this game is even better!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR SURE!			"

												Binding of Isaac is brilliant. Each time you play the dungeon is completely randomised; the rooms, weapons and monsters are all completely different and so you never have the same playthrough. There's plenty of luck involved because if you don't get good items you probably won't make it too far. When you do though it is rewarding. You'll probably rage quit a few times and it takes a while to get good at the game but it's worth it, I'm hooked! The DLC is pretty good too but I'd advise getting seasoned with the game first as it does make things harder. More monsters, floors and items.. Everything you need to make each playthrough even more different from the last! Buy this game, because for £3.99 it's a steal, and if you can get it in a sale even better!			"

												I've put so much time into this game, and I'll likely put even more into it. The length of a playthrough is perfect for the Rouglike style. The mechanics are finely tuned and fun. Most interesting is the deep upgrade system, which stacks in some amazing ways. It's fun to play just to see what new combinations of power ups I might get!			"

												Punishing, disturbing, tight, and atmospheric; I *LOVE* The Binding of Isaac! A huge mix of items, each with their own unique and sometimes mysterious effects, excellent difficulty ramp, gut-wrenching enemies and environments, and little touches that makes each new game a brand-new adventure. The art-style is very simplistic, but effective in evoking the twisted and disgusting views of an abused child. If you like punishing, randomly generated, visceral games, there are few that do it as well as The Binding of Isaac.			"

												Roguelike meets bullet hell. Another instant classic from Edmund McMillen. That name alone should make you buy it, but the game is so awesome in all departments: gameplay, replayability, nightmarish yet funny design, insane number of items which affect your character. I love it. You will love it. Don't forget to get the single DLC for more bizzare items and monsters.The only sad thing is that your PC should be decent enough to run it, though you wouldn't think that if you judge by the screenshots. This is because the game is made with Flash and is huge, so I can't play it comfortably (too much lag) on my cheap laptop I take with me when travelling. Too bad.Can't wait for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth! It will rock!			"

This game makes me think of a young child trapped in the paranormal fears of Courage the Cowardly Dog in an attempt to escape from Gannon's Castle.			"

												This is hands down one of the best indie games that I've had the pleasure of playing. There is so much replayability, it's unreal. The random spawning rooms, random upgrades, random weapons, no two playthroughs are the same. And unlike a lot of games released these days The Binding of Isaac is challenging, as there are no save slots and when you die that's it, Game Over... Start again. Add in the fact that there are over 10 endings, which all add to the game time. If you want a bit more of a challenge I'd also recommend buying the Wrath of Lamb dlc. This adds more rooms, more bosses, more items and increases the challenge tenfold.			"

At first you might be thinking "" What the hell am I playing?"", but after you start playing it you will learn the gameplay and the style of the game.

												The Binding of Isaac is a game where your mother is corrupted by sin and tries to kill you to please her ""lord"" and just before death you escape into a mysterious cave hidden under your rug. Within said cave you must acquire upgrades and kill ugly, vile, and probably smelly enemies such as flies, zombie headless things... And not to forget bosses. Some bosses include but are not limited to: Monstro, Larry Jr., Chub, and last but not least...*drum roll* Steven! As you make your way to the final floor you must kill your mother with all the items you've acquired. (By the way the whole game revolves around killing your mother for the most part.).Once your mother is dead you must delve into her ""womb"" and make your way to her heart. To wrap things up, this game is pretty Bad... BADASS! The game can provide you with endless hours of gameplay, so try it out, I mean really, it's only $5.			"

												When I bought this game on 2012 Summer Sales, I thought it was just another indie game that would provide a limited amount of fun until its gameplay were squeezed out. A hundred hours later, I am still addicted to its gameplay. Every time you enter the game, it is different; the objects you find (passives, actives, trinkets, drops), the rooms, the enemies, the final bosses; they kill you after 50 minutes, you end up with nothing. But you press the play button again, you unlock a new item you have never seen, you kill everything with your insane ammount of damage, you feel powerful. And you die again.Plus, its religious/parodical theme makes it even more appealing if you are interested in these religious ormystical parafernalia. (Do not take me wrong, this game is in no way supporting nor insulting religion)The perfect combination of fun and frustration renders the game the perfect choice if you want something cheap, not demanding at all, and with a simple touch of fun.

												When I first got this game, I lost sleep. This game is stupidly addictive.A fantastic game, and this is why you should buy it:Pros:-Tons of items-The most replayability i've seen in a game in a while-Lots of achievements-Loads of fun-NEVER gets old-The art is magnificent-The theme is controversial, yet innovative-DLC that pretty much triples everything in the gameCons:-The DLC is needed for full potential-Flash isn't the best game-runner, it can lagThis game is very good, I would recommend it to anyone. 9/10Please take this from someone who has dedicated lots of time and effort into this game.Hope this helped!

												The Binding of Isaac is a game where your mother is corrupted by sin and tries to kill you to please her ""lord"" and just before death you escape into a mysterious cave hidden under your rug. Within said cave you must acquire upgrades and kill ugly, vile, and probably smelly enemies such as flies, zombie headless things... And not to forget bosses. Some bosses include but are not limited to: Monstro, Larry Jr., Chub, and last but not least...*drum roll* Steven! As you make your way to the final floor you must kill your mother with all the items you've acquired. (By the way the whole game revolves around killing your mother for the most part.).Once your mother is dead you must delve into her ""womb"" and make your way to her heart. To wrap things up, this game is pretty Bad... BADASS! The game can provide you with endless hours of gameplay, so try it out, I mean really, it's only $5.			"

												Binding of Isaac is brilliant. Each time you play the dungeon is completely randomised; the rooms, weapons and monsters are all completely different and so you never have the same playthrough. There's plenty of luck involved because if you don't get good items you probably won't make it too far. When you do though it is rewarding. You'll probably rage quit a few times and it takes a while to get good at the game but it's worth it, I'm hooked! The DLC is pretty good too but I'd advise getting seasoned with the game first as it does make things harder. More monsters, floors and items.. Everything you need to make each playthrough even more different from the last! Buy this game, because for £3.99 it's a steal, and if you can get it in a sale even better!			"

												The binding of Isaac does many things right when it comes to getting the player straight into the action. This action requires very precise and accurate reflexes to get into the end game. This is a very good game to exercise those reflexes and hone in quick decision making. This DOES require some outside research as to what certain upgrades do. Item choice matters greatly as some do more harm than good to your power. Overall, 9/10. The 1 dock being the amount of sheer repetition needed to unock later level tiers. I find it necessary for the game design and is implemented well, but just a tad bit too much for my taste.			"

												Okay, I guess since this is the most played game I have on my library, I've got some things to say about it. First of all, the game can be really hard on new players, but within a few hours you'll find yourself dwelling deeper into the depths of the basement (literally). The randomness of rooms, enemies and items you get each time really adds up for the replay, which is basically infinite. You feel challenged, sometimes a little unfairly, but most of the times, you're the only responsible for your success or defeat. It's very hard to put into words how much I enjoy playing this game. Each time you beat the game, it expands even more, and there's also challenges to complete, secrets to find, endings to discover, and to top all of that, a huge set of achievements to unlock, which will take your time very good. So, if you want a game that it's challenging, time-consuming and addictive, you can't go wrong for such a small price. And be sure to get the Wrath of the Lamb DLC as well.			"

												This game can be sum up into 1 word: ""Awesome"". Simple but tense 2D roguelike action. The randomness in the level design and item spawning makes this game unique each time I start a new run.Huge hidden item collection which affects the gameplay and the increasing difficulty after each completed run makes this game seems ""grindy"".The story is kinda messed up and take some time to understand the meaning behind it.The bloody and gory graphic makes it feels weird to play this game in front of friends.The minus side of this game is that it was built on the Flash framework which causes minor crashes sometimes no matter what spec of your computer. Hope this game would have a remake in the future.			"

												At first, I was contemplating Not Recommending this game.  It's frustrating, agrivating, and damn near impossible.  But then I stopped myself, because that's why this game is SO GOOD.  The difficulty gives it a level of replayability that is almost unmatched by other games, and the variety of different items, consumables, and trinkets you can find, the challenges you can complete, and the characters you can unlock only add to that addicitive quality.  Plus, at it's current price, with the addition of the sale that is taking place at the time of posting this, it's so cheap that it's almost a giveaway.  I mean 4.99, that's less than a footlong at Subway.  So stop stalling, hurry up, and buy this game.			"

												""If there are two people who I believe are going to save hardcore gaming, it's Hideki Kamiya and Edmund McMillen.""-SelfCreated behind the same mind that brought you Super Meat Boy, The Binding of Isaac is a randomly-generated dungeon crawler with light rpg elements present and constant action. Set in a twisted atmosphere with dark themes ranging from child abuse, gender identity, suicide, abortion and how religion might negatively affect a child, you play as Isaac; a child who is relentlessly being hunted by his mother, who believes her son is corrupted by sin and must sacrifice him to prove her love to her god after hearing his voice. The game can be brutal at moments, due to not knowing how the game is played and randomly generated levels. However, the longer you play the game, the better you will understand how the game is played and where secrets are placed, what the items do and attack patterns your enemies display. It instructs you with trial and error gameplay and it's random but understandable level design. This is easily one of the best designed games I've ever played, and look forward to the remake of this game.Since this is a flash game,however, expect to have random framerate crashes, as the game is packed with so much content there will be moments where the game will slow down and may even stop responding.If you are a fan of the NES Legend of Zelda dungeioneering and/or a challenging game with a test of wits and reflexes, this is for you.

												Cute characters, grim storyline and basic gameplay combine to create a dungeon of treasures, literally.Fitting music and gruesome sound effects; the audio varies from funny to haunting, exactly that of the atmosphere.Not many games allow you to fart on your enemies or lay down a bog to no perceivable effect.Character upgrades are truly satisfying but come at a price, leaving you to decide where to compromise.Unforgiving with only 1 life, but with the random generation there is enough replayability to get past it, and with characters like these, it's difficult to stay mad at such a game.Some performance issues do strike during action-packed moments, how this is possible in what seems to be such a basic game goes unanswered, hopefully these issues will be resolved with an update. - Weren't fixed, runs like crap, what a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥Overall, it's hard not to love at least one aspect of this game, but sick of people not optimising their♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Wow, I thought i had already recommended 'The Binding of Isaac'. Ok, so the video for tBoI doesn't particularily capture the games content, but its a dungeon crawler and throughout each play the ENTIRE crawl is randomized, from the rooms, treasure, bosses [There are tons of bosses] all the way to the decorations and whatnot. Music is fantastic, gameplay is solid (and easy to pick up), there's in excess of 16 endings or something like that (considerably more with WoTL), and completing a run just unlocks more treasures, bosses and floors (to not spoil anything). The Only downside is the inablility to save mid game so you've got to set aside a 45m set to do a good run. Regarding the DLC 'Wrath of the Lamb': A massive amount of content is added (see +=50%) which increases the general difficulty and overall variety and fun of the game for an absolutely minimal price. Replay value is magnificent and 'completing' the game will take a long time. As a side note, don't take the somewhat warped religious view and general violence of the game to heart and don't let it turn you away, it is meant for entertainment so getting all disgruntled over it is grossly unneccesary.

												The entire concept of achievements is still somewhat controversial. Some argue that when used well they can add depth to games by giving you new ways to play, while others argue that they are nothing more than the human version of conditioning lab rats to press a button for a pellet (see: XBOX Live, Facebook Games). While I usually hate the latter variety of achievement, no game has ever made me into a happier, more mindless, lab rat than ""The Binding of Isaac."" It is entirely shameless in the way it uses items, achievements, and unlocks to keep you playing ""just one more game."" But despite being made in flash this is no mindless Facebook game either. This is an action rogue-like with real depth. The game play is fast and fun, while the randomized items are perfectly balanced so that in each game you will not only find something new, but also have to constantly make agonizingly tough decisions about which items to take and which to leave behind. One of my favs of 2011.			"

												If you want a game that's tricky, arcade like and doesn't take itself too seriously, this is your game.If you want a creepy, sad arcade game with a dark story behind it, this is your game.The Binding of Isaac is one hell of a game. Now I can admit I'm not very good at it but after playing a fair few runs and reading up on the story, I have to say, I love this game.You can tell a lot of work went into it and I really am in love with the art style.

												The Binding of Isaac is an amazing 2D roguelike game. It combines brutal difficulty, random dungeons, hundreds of items, and that classic Legend of Zelda feel into one really awesome and challenging game. It will take some getting used too, but once you have got the basics down, you'll have tonnes of fun playing this game.If you are good at running and gunning, you'll love this game... Now, just combine fast paced gaming, brutal enemies, hundreds of item combinations, random dungeon structures, and a wide variety of bosses, and you've pretty much summed up this epic game.8.5 out of 10.

												A dark twist on a familiar play style.  I have to say that Team Meat has never surprised me when it comes to the games that they make.  Often times I find myself playing the title because of their team name.  If you are a fan of Super Meat Boy, and want to play a game drawn by them but similar to the play style of Zelda a link to the past, then this is the game for you!  Two thumbs up if I do say so myself.			"

												This game was made by Edmund McMuffinMan, the same guy who made Super Meat Boy so I picked it up one day when it was on sale. I mainly got it because it was recommended and it had trading cards so I didn't give it a fair chance when i first played it. A few months later I heard about Rebirth so I thought hmm, maybe I should give that game another chance... a real chance. So I did and now I love it! It's addicting and now I'm eagerly waiting for Rebirth as it is so fun. I definately would reccomend picking this up. It was a game that surprised me on just how great it really was!			"

												The Binding of Isaac, and its DLC Wrath of the Lamb is an old school dungeon crawl, reminiscent of Legend of Zelda, and your worst nightmares and or mindscrews. I HIGHLY recommend it.to make it clear: this game takes the concept of grimdark and elopes with it. you might want a strong drink once you're done crying from its crippling difficulty, but just as with an abusive relationship, you can't help but come back to it for another helping. definitely a great game, with the simplicity you want in the controls, the difficulty you crave, unique graphics, and a soundtrack that will chill you right down your spine.have a listen here, this guy fell in love with the OST, while i go back to playing it.

Don´t hope that you have a chance every time you start a game - cause sometimes Mother is just stronger than you. Or that annoying little fly, that is not deadly normally.But normally you don´t run with an embryo attached to your head through a dungeon hoping not to encounter your mother and eating pills, blowing up things with bombs, making pacts with devils and several other stuff.See for yourself and have fun.

												Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television. Life was simple and they were both happy. That was until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above:""Your son has become corrupted by sin. He needs to be saved.""""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life.Again the voice called to her:""Isaac's soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins.""""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in thee,"" Isaac's mother replied as she locked Isaac in his room away from the evils of the world.One last time Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her:""You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you.""""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged.""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life as an offering to me, to prove you love me above all else.""""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butchers knife from the kitchen.Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch just as his mother burst through his door and threw himself down into the unknown depths below...			"

												The binding of Isaac игра, в которую стоит поиграть. Дайте ей шанс, и она вас еще долго не отпустит.   А теперь по-подробней. The binding of Isaac - творение Эдмунда Макмиллена. Чем известен этот человек? Вам говорит о чем-нибудь игра Super Meat Boy? Именно этот дядька ее создал. А слыхали о Gish? Тоже его творение. Не говоря уж о множество Flash игр, которыми он изначально занимался: Coil, Triachnid, Time ♥♥♥♥, Grey-Matter, Aether - все это создал сей замечательный человек. Но речь не о нем. А об Isaac. Жанр этой игры - roguelike. Каждый ""раунд"" в этой игре можно назвать уникальным так, как в игре множество вещей, которые вы по ходу игры находите и используйте. Вещи эти самые разнообразные: от простого гвоздя до эмбриона в баночке. Новичку это может показаться странным: ""Гвоздь? Эмбрион? Что за ху**я?!"" Однако, каждый предмет меняет/дополняет не только способности, но и внешний вид. Под конец игры может выйти страшный, черный, летающий, злобно улыбающийся призрак. А может и....................котик :3 По мимо интересных вещей есть не менее интересные боссы. И они заставят вас поплакать, как девочку, которая резала лук и смотрела Хатико одновременно!!! Серьезно, если вы умрете, то начнете все сначала. А боссы не щадят никого. Кстати, по мере прохождения игры вам будут доступны новые вещи, комнаты, боссы и персонажи. Так что заскучать она вам не даст. Не расстраивайтесь если не сможете пройти игру за первые дни. Ибо я прошел ее в первый раз только спустя 50 часов! Но, ГОСПОДИ, как я был горд собой. Эта победа сделала мой день. И затем пошло и поехало. Я продолжал ее проходить. А после 11 прохождение игра становится длиннее!!! Господи, я так и не смог пройти ее дальше(    Итог: Господи, ты должен ее купить. Она того стоит!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												This epic adventure is endless. First it ends, then it ends, then it ends, and if you have the DLC it ends once more. I've enjoyed every bit of it. Once you beat the game on the last ending (the final ending) there is still more to do. Depending on your skill level, many hours of gameplay may await. The overall game is nice too. Every boss varies and requires different methods of managing to defeat them. The art is great, but it may make it look like a kid's game although its dark atmosphere assures it's not. Have fun crying on poop, getting eaten by flies, and purchasing pills from a hanged man!			"

												Let me start this review by saying that I hated the game at the beginning so much that I wrote a negative review about it. I hated the bugs, the lags because of the poor (flash based) game engine and of course the ultra-hard difficulty. So why did I change my opinion about it? Well, I still kinda hate it but not in a bad way :)The Binding of Isaac is a game for hardcore gamers! Period. We all have been spoiled by the new(er) games with lengthy tutorials, huge amounts of hints and by a difficulty so easy that you're asking yourself if the game is made for kids. Not with this game! The difficulty is hard. Extremely hard! You need to have fast reflexes, think and move smart and if all else fails then only luck can save you. Even when you know all of the dirty tricks and moves of your enemies, there's still no guarantee you won't get hit and eventually die. It's always a challenge no matter how good you're at it and on top of that the randomly generated levels offer endless replay value.Long story short; this game will make you a better gamer overall. You don't believe me? Now hear me out. I just collected the final achievement called ""Platinum God!"" and the feeling is amazing. I feel like I can tackle and complete every game out there. It was worth every hour I spent with the game even though I was mad, frustrated, angry and in a rage quit mood quite often. Be warned though. You need a lot of patience, skills and balls of steel to beat this game. So if you're a casual gamer avoid it all cost.GG!			"

												Challenging, fun, addicting, and highly replayable.  I would recommend it to anybody really.  Controls are simple, items are unique and varied, and the art style is cute but at the same time a bit crude(in a good way of course).  There is a pretty noticeable problem when it comes to performance, since this game was made in Flash, it will lag like crazy during intense moments in the game. While this is a great game, at this point there really isn't any reason to buy this game over Rebirth now that that's out.			"

												I guess I'm late to the party, but that this game is more than recommended can't be stressed enough.The Binding of Isaac is a roguelike with almost unlimited replay value, lots of black humor and a story skillfully told with just a hand full of spoken words.Playing through the game multiple times unlocks new items, levels and difficulties and the ride does not seem to ever stop. Other than many roguelike games, it manages to never get unfair - the player always has strategies at hand that can get him through the game. It may take him some (or some more) tries in the beginning tho :)Add this up with a lovely soundtrack and a DLC that doubles the already vast content and you've got a month, a quarter, maybe even half a year covered.There's just one downside: The Binding of Isaac Rebirth is now out - a remake improving on almost every aspect whilst also adding massive content. You may consider getting this one instead.			"

Given the simplicity in controls, pure randomness in not only floor design but in items given and the seemingly short story that we see unfold into a wide span of 10+ endings and different characters and challenges each with their own unique abilities and downfalls. In short, Binding of Isaac is a fantastic game.			"

												Must play! If you did not already pick it up you must now!The Binding of Isaac is easy game but hard to master. So there is something for the people that just want to play for a few hours, aswell as the hardcore players. The way the game is made it constantly pushes you to try again, and beat that boss or layer that destroyed you last time. The first few times you play the game, you won't get that far, but when you start learning the patterns of the creatures that is when the game really starts! I have 300 hours in this game...... trust me if i didn't mean it. I wouldn't have done that.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a micro dungeon crawler and expands itself the more runs you put into the game. It generates stages in a Zelda: Link to the Past sort of way, with a similair map style. I love the music in this game and the bosses are fun and grotesque. This game was pretty damn tough when I bought it, but it was worth it. It becomes easier and easier to get farther. Linux support would be nice, seeing there is already Mac support but there is no cause to complain. I can't wait for the remake!EDIT: There are saves for this game on YouTube, I lost my save due to lack of cloud support, added a save, got 9 achievements at once. It gave me the characters and such and saved about 40 hours of items I already had collected plus twenty more. In closing the worst fault of this game is easily fixed, if you haven't played it and use this technique I'd advise you not or you'll spoil the entire expierience. At 80 hours I barely have over half the achievements in this game, making it the most replayed game I own. Replay value seems nearly infinite.			"

												The Binding of Isaac appears to be a very addictive game. You start out with only a few rooms to go through to kill Mom, but after that, the game expands more, so you have to play through it longer. I certainly died a lot of times before defeating Mom, and later her heart. The way that each time you play generates a different map set-up helps in making the game very addictive. If you play this game, get ready to become very involved in it. Overall, I highly recommend this game to those who enjoy addictive gameplay.			"

												What a great game!I bought this game in the Steam Winter Sale, when it was available for 0,66€ including the DLC. I saw some gameplay-videos before, but never found it particularly interesting. However, that changed a few weeks ago when a friend of mine told me that it was quite fun. So I decided to give it a try for a that cheap price. What shall I say...? I have never been that addicted to a game in such a short time! It's an indie masterpiece.The Characters:You are playing as one out of seven characters. By default, only Isaac is unlocked, for the others you have to achieve certain victories or find certain items in order to unlock them. Each character has it's own pros and cons, so it's pretty much up to the player which one to play.The Story:Actually, there's not much story in the game. To sum it up, it'd be as follows (no spoilers, d'oh!): Isaacs' mum which is a strong believer in some kind of god, wants to kill you, because her ""god"" told her to do so. It is up to you to get stronger by finding items and unlocking more and powerful abilities (which come with items) to finally kill your mum. Voilà.The Gameplay:Basically, in The Binding of Isaac you run through small areas (called rooms). There are 6 levels until you get to the bossfight. Each level contains of around 5 to 15 areas. But don't let these small numbers fool you! The game is insanely challening, I'm hardly able to reach level 4 by now, and if I do, I was insanely lucky with the items. Speaking of items, they upgrade your basic stats or change something about your abilities. For example, you might get +1 attack, get faster, get a buddy who shoots enemies whenever you shoot, or get a stronger attack.There's a main attack (your tears) and a secondary attack, which is fired when pressing spacebar. The main attack can be upgraded by finding items, however, in order to get a secondary attack, you will only have one when you find a secondary-attack item.Except when using certain items you have one live only. When you die, you have to start at zero again, no items, no buffs, nothing. However, your HP can be upgraded or degraded, but it still required skill to beat the game.Information about the graphics and certain gameplay elements:Most of the items you'll find will mutilate your character. This sometimes looks quite gross, especially if you consider the young age of the main protagonist, Isaac. So if you're a squeamish person, you might want to take this into account. However, the graphics are in no way hyperrealistic, which minimalizes this problem I guess.Summary:If I had to use points in order to show, how good or bad the game is, here is what it'd look like:Graphics: 6/10 (awesome animations, everything looks sweet, but it's quite repetitive)Gameplay: 10/10 (insanely nice working, hard but fair)Story: WHO CARES?Addiction-level: 8/10 (I don't know yet how long this game will entertain me, but at the moment it's freaking addictive)Fun-level: 10/10 (this is very personal, ofc.)PS: There's sometimes a problem with the achievements, meaning you can't unlock them. Then you have to follow some guides in order to be able to unlock them. If you're an achievement-hunter, this might be interesting for you.			"

												Hands down the most addictive indie game I've ever played. I clocked in somewhere around twenty hours in the first week of playing it, and only managed to beat the game twice in that time period. Tacked on a few more since then, and it hasn't lost any of its fun factor, the replay value is just downright incredible.			"

Cry or DieA former shell of a boy turned lump-of-flesh, Isaac must endure the horrors of lost siblings that never came to be. These undead fetuses are hellbent on destroying Isaac's very way of living and are very angry, that is to say, not only at him but at his mother even more so. Mom receives a godsend message from the Lord one day, asking her to prove her devotion and faith by sacrificing her son, Isaac. Who knows if his late brothers and sisters suffered the same fate, but one thing's for certain, Isaac isn't going to wait to find out!Overall, the top-down arcade style of The Binding of Isaac is great fun to be had. The levels are generated at random each time, and knowing this, makes for high replay value... from an indie game no doubt! Enemies are unique in appearance, there are various items with special capabliities, and plus, you take down your foes by crying a surge of tear drops! Poor Isaac... more fun for us then!			"

												What's the difference between The Binding of Isaac and  cheap booze? They're both hard, confusing, rough around the edges, eat up a lot of your time and can send you in a downward spiral in life.But with the Binding of Isaac there isn't a hangover and you only have to buy it once.Buy the game.

												Let me start this review by saying that I hated the game at the beginning so much that I wrote a negative review about it. I hated the bugs, the lags because of the poor (flash based) game engine and of course the ultra-hard difficulty. So why did I change my opinion about it? Well, I still kinda hate it but not in a bad way :)The Binding of Isaac is a game for hardcore gamers! Period. We all have been spoiled by the new(er) games with lengthy tutorials, huge amounts of hints and by a difficulty so easy that you're asking yourself if the game is made for kids. Not with this game! The difficulty is hard. Extremely hard! You need to have fast reflexes, think and move smart and if all else fails then only luck can save you. Even when you know all of the dirty tricks and moves of your enemies, there's still no guarantee you won't get hit and eventually die. It's always a challenge no matter how good you're at it and on top of that the randomly generated levels offer endless replay value.Long story short; this game will make you a better gamer overall. You don't believe me? Now hear me out. I just collected the final achievement called ""Platinum God!"" and the feeling is amazing. I feel like I can tackle and complete every game out there. It was worth every hour I spent with the game even though I was mad, frustrated, angry and in a rage quit mood quite often. Be warned though. You need a lot of patience, skills and balls of steel to beat this game. So if you're a casual gamer avoid it all cost.GG!			"

												This game is amazing. I have over 100 hours logged in it and I'm stil enjoying it.PROS- Random runs provide limitless entertainment, no two runs are the same, there are a lot of different bosses and enemies to face giving another element of replayability to the game, SO MANY ITEMS and different combinations to discover, it is fairly well balanced, there is a clear progression from early game to end game, you will get a massive ego boost when you beat each end boss for the first time, it's great to play while listening to music and podcasts as it requires no extreme concentration for a majority of the game and has little dialogue.CONS- There are a few bugs graphically but nothing that will impact your enjoyment, it's addictingNEUTRAL- There isn't much in-game explanation but trial, error and googling will give you more than enough informationOVERALL- BUY THIS GAME AND WRATH OF LAMB! This is one of my favorite games of all time and I cannot wait for the remake that is slated for later this year.			"

												In The Binding of Isaac, you play as a young boy of about 4 who, on the run from his demented mother who wants to sacrifice him to God, falls into a twisted basement full of grotesque and horrifying creatures whom he must fight...by crying on them.  In this game there is permadeath--no checkpoints; if you die you must start over from the beginning.  In  each procedurally generated floor, there are progressively greater numbers of rooms filled with progressively harder enemies.  Within these rooms you get pickup items such as bombs and keys, as well as collectible items that upgrade your character with such effects as increased fire rate, homing tears, flight, and many many more.  The enemies are varied and entertaining, the endless RNG ensures that no two runs are the same, and the selection of nearly 200 items will have Isaac finishing every run with a different look and different abilities.  This is an absolutely brilliant game with well-balanced difficulty, (that is, hard, but not rage-inducing Dark Souls-tier hard) tight controls, amusing art, and endless replay value.  Go ahead and spend the small price of five dollars.  I assure you you won't be disappointed.			"

												Binding of Isaac is one of my favorite roguelike rpg/dungeon crawlers of all time.  There didn't seem to be much of a demand for games like Binding of Isaac before it came out, but when I played it, with its irreverent Legend of Zelda-esque dungeons full of interesting monsters and items, I simply could not put it down.  I highly recommend this to any gamer, but especially one who loved old school Legend of Zelda games.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a Randomly Generated, Roguelike dungeon-Crawler game with difficulty being it's strong suit. This game will make you quit and rage on multiple occasions, but I gurantee to you this is worth it. Heck, even pick up the DLC if you've got the money to spare. It's worth every penny.There will be times where you wish you hadn't bought it, but you will learn to become good at this, and you will learn to respect this. The amount of random generation gives this game a gargantuan amount of replayability. I very strongly recommend that anyone who is a fan of rogue-like dungeon crawlers to pick this game up. It will rock your world, and your weekend.			"

												Take the original legend of zelda, a generous helping of heavy religious themes and overtones, internet culture and then throw political correctness out of the nearest window and put it all in a blender.  what you end up with is a truly great game where every single playthrough is completely random and unique from the items and powerups you find to the layout and enemies you find in each and every room you enter. half of the fun of isaac is never quite knowing what you're going to find or come across in that particular playthrough and finding new items and discovering what they do and how they combine with the other items you've discovered, the fact that your characters appearance also changes, sometimes drastically, depending on what you've found is another aspect that adds to the discovery of the game.in terms of negatives if you don't do well with bullet hell games then you will definitely find the later areas of the game challenging as it can be unforgiving, but rewarding, at times, also if you think you would take offence to the idea of a small child fighting off the corpses of his dead siblings with his own tears then you should probably give the game a miss lolbut overall i love the game, has become one of my favourites of all time and im just waiting for rebirth now.

And despite the short runs, this is a 300 hour game if you wanna unlock everything. With it's randomly generated dungeons, 7 playable characters, 4 unlockable worlds, hundreds of items, and so many enemies, this game has so much reply value. Even if you've gotten a 100% in this game, you can come back and play it for another 100, 200, or 300 hours! Simply amazing, and it's $5 price tag, as well as only $3 for the DLC, this game is a must have for ANYBODY who has a Steam. 12/10			"

												A classic up there with the likes of Super Mario Bros. and Legend of Zelda (who it pays homage to). THE rogue-like of all rogue-likes and one of only four 10/10 games I have ever experienced (another of which is Binding of Isaac: Rebirth). If you haven't played this game yet, you owe it to yourself to give it a try. For the hours upon hours of replay value that you'll get from this game, you CAN NOT beat the price. Seriously. I have put in an easy 120 hours into this one alone not counting the other 100 hours I have invested in Rebirth so far (and I've just barely scratched the surface on that one).The game seems so simple the first time you play it. And then you play it again and realize it's like playing an entirely different game. And so on, and so on. There are just so many builds, unlockables and other variables, no 2 runs ever feel exactly the same. One of, if not THE most replayable game I've ever played.			"

												It's not quite Dungeons of Dredmor--which is by far the better deal--but it is fun in its own right, mixing the most shallow the roguelike experience can offer with the most shallow of Zelda dungeon-crawling.  It works darn well as a pick-up-and-play title, with you either victorious (unlikely) or dead all under 20 minutes.  However far you get is largely determined by the luck of the randomly-generated draw: power-ups you get, health available, enemies you face.The perfect title if ye're lookin' for a time-killer.  You'll probably never see all the collectables and secrets the game has to offer.			"

The imagry is amazing, the soundtrack is beautifully fitting, the design and playability and REplayability are enormous - there aren't enough games like this. Buy this game.

Lots of variety (especially with the expansion), unique enemies, and a fun challenge. Only thing is, the flash engine really holds it back, making it a bit buggy and glitchy when it shouldn't be.

												Ever since I've seen this game played, I had to play it and I had to have it. I ended up winning it in a game giveaway on Twitch.tv not much later and this game has quickly become one of my favorites. I've logged the most hours on it out of every game in my inventory and with the Wrath of the Lamb content expansion, there's no way I'll stop playing it well into the future. The story and gameplay is simple, but keeps you coming back for more. Definitely recommend this game to people who like top-down games, addictive gameplay, and RPG/dungeon-crawler elements. With many items to unlock, achievements to get and the EXTREMELY high replay value this game has, I'm definitely proud to have it in my Library!			"

												A rather fun game.  A single run of the game is short, but it works since there is no save function.  The rogue-like elements make the game very enjoyable, as each dungeon level is completely different between game sessions.  It takes a little getting used to, and you must expect to have to restart a few times before finally completing it, but the randomness and difficulty, which is challenging but not overly difficult, make the game very enjoyable.

												This is one of my favourite indy games to come out this year. Binding of Isaac gives the experience of dugeon crawling from early Legend of Zelda games, with procedural generated content being a major factor. Rooms, enmies, bosses, and items are all randomly generated for every play through, which makes for incredibly unique experiences every time you play. The glaring issues with this title seem to all be represented on the technical side of things: deleting temporary browser data /still/ wipes part of your save file,  no steam cloud support, limited control configuration (no gamepad support). Gribes aside, Binding of Isaac offers hours of arcade-like entertainment with high replay value, all for a mere $5.			"

												Binding Of isaacI got this game a copple of days ago after watching it for a long time on live streams and youtube!I absolutly love this game to HELL(Or the basement), The binding of isaac is a indie game made by Edmund MCmillen(also made Super meat boy) and Florian himsl. The binding of isaac (BoI for short) is a roguelike indie ""Dungeon crawler"", Where you the player(Isaac) needs to escape to the basement and escape the wrath of your own mother.The controlls are super easy to use you use W,A,S and D to walk and the arrow keys to shoot... and space to use your item(space bar itemsThe game and controlls are easy to pick up and play but REALY hard to master. If you like zelda dungeons then you will 100% like this game.The gameplay focuses on isaac that needs to go trough dungeons fighting of rooms of monsters and getting ""Uprades"" to get stronger(and make look isaac MORE stupid every item you pick up).Along side isaac there are more chacters to unlock, that need different things to be unlocked. 1 for example needs you to have a lot of money and the other to have a lot of hearts.Binding of isaac is targeted to a more mature part of the audienceThe visuals in the game are good enough for a game like this and item and monster sprites are REALY well done, The only problem you may have are some item descriptions are not correct and some items not work.The reason for that is that BoI is made on a flash engine so sometimes laggs on good computers, or things not work properly, and its realy diffecult to patchBinding of isaac is a great game to play and the DLC makes it even more beter with new versions of monsters, Items called""trinkets"" New items and even more bosses and to top it all of 2 whole new area's to fight 2 very strong bossesThe binding of isaac is a great game to buy and just play a ton of or play for a hour and lay it down(or just die on the first level and just trow your computer out of the window)			"

The game itself is a great, challenging experience, full of raunchy humour, fast paced gameplay, fun-to-kill enemies and action-packed boss battles but once you get to the ""Wrath of the Lamb"" DLC, you'll be pulling your hair out and begging for more. WOTL is not only a small DLC, it's a HUGE expansion pack, adding unique, and terrifying new items, enemies and characters. This is a solid 9.3/10, if anyone cares.

												I've played 300+ hours of The Binding of Isaac. If anyone's qualified to talk about this game, it's people like me. I love this game so much that I bought the $40.00 on-disc copy. Now, without further ado, let's get down to brass tacks. TBoI is a randomly-generated ""rougue-like"" heavily inspired by games such as The Legend of Zelda, which happens to be one my all time favorite franchises. The items you acquire on each new and different run alter both your playstyle and your appearance, forcing you to adapt to new strategies and find new ways to overcome your foes. All of these elements combine to create one of the most complete packages I've ever seen in a game. Tack on a DLC that doubles the content and a remake on the horizen, and you've got the best game $5.00 (or $1.24) can buy.			"

There are also characters to unlock. There are many bosses and enemies to face too. There are items to collect too, from a teleporting pill to a book which spawns lots and lots of bombs. These items even change your appearance too from looking like a total badass to a poisioned crack addict.

												For me, one of my all time favorite games was Legend of Zelda on the NES.  Binding of Isaac takes the feel of that original cartridge game and gives it a scatalogical overhaul.  With a difficulty level approaching some of the toughest platformer and shooting games I've ever played, it's a serious game despite it's immature slant.  The randomly generated dungeons lead you to earning meta-acheivments, meaning each time you play you aren't necessarily playing to win, but to unlock something for your next run.The randomness of the game is a feature and also highly frustrating.  Sometimes you get bad items on the first level or two, and you just know you have no chance to win that run.  Yet you reset the game and keep playing. Ultimately I find myself booting this game up more then any other steam game though.  Despite it's difficulty I can play it for five minutes or five hours and I'm always treated to a great experience.   If you don't have Binding of Isaac yet, you're missing out.			"

												Story: Very interesting story, if not a bit dull or unexplained.Characters: A lot of the characters are mysterious, and the enemies are very disturbing or spine-tingling.Combat: Simple yet skillful. learn to throw your ""arrows"" around corners.Gameplay: Most of the time the game can be completed within an hour, but it takes a very long time to complete the collection. Keep playin'. The game is also very difficult, and in some ways a bit unforgiving. Very rogue-like.This game is extremely fun and entertaining, and I am certainly going to play more of it. The only downside I can find is it's disturbing material, and how it can be offensive to some. I personally find this to be extremely interesting.4.5/5Strongly Recommended.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a good game. It is a really good rogue-like dungeon-crawler and it is fun... but it gets boring, at least for me, real quick.I don't have any want or need to play this again. There are randomly generated levels and random pickups, but for me, it's not enough.Why do I give it a thumbs up then? It is a good game, and you should buy it, but if you don't like games like Gantlet (the older ones) or similar dungeon crawler games where you don't keep anything after death, don't get this game.

												The Binding of Isaac is a game that is Funny, Creepy, Challenging, and Disturbing... All in all... its worth its money and even more... its endlessly replayable and is fun to watch your character develop throughout the run... but I do advise that you have alot of time on your hands because once you play it... you just cant stop with one run... 10 out of 10 I'd say			"

												Never been so addicted to a game.The amount of unlockable content is outstanding, mechanics are simple, the game is challenging, and the ambiguity of the game such as randomly generated rooms and the fact that the function of items are hidden until you use it to see for yourself is what makes this game unique and fun game to kill time.

												Love this game. The Binding of Isaac is a game with twists and turns. You never know who, or what, is around the corner. There are items that assist you, are overpowered, or completely useless. You can play this over and over again and never have the same run. There is a multitude of bosses and they are also randomised (bar four bosses; Mom, Mom's Heart/It Lives, Isaac and ??? [Blue Baby]) There are characters with different stats and starting items (you start with Isaac, then unlock the rest) I love this game.			"

												They need to add difficulties or something, I'm not someone who plays a game for two seconds then gives up because it's ""too hard', but this is ridiculous. Also, I just can't take how everything is randomized, down to the enemies you meet. If you like the game, you can get the DLC which for some reason makes the game even more difficult! (Check the BoI wiki, it states the DLC is more difficult than the normal game)			"

Posted: July 14, 2014
												Isaac comes to in the upper level of the basement and you, the player, must guide him through the dangers that lurk below. The UI is very similar to what you’d expect from an early Zelda title. You have three heart containers. Three counters keep track of your amount of coins, bombs, and keys. The dungeon layout is shown on the upper left and your current items are listed next to your heart containers. You start out with only your tears to fight off the grotesque creatures of the basement. Each floor of the basement is littered with a slew of enemies, chests, items, a treasure room, and a boss room. Upon entering a room, all of the doors will lock until every enemy in it has been defeated. You can blow open a door, but it will cost a single bomb. Useable items can often be found in chests, but are also dropped from enemies. These could be tarot cards, pills, or some other miscellaneous item. Where as the tarot cards have a specific use, pills have random uses. These range from incredibly useful to potentially harmful, so consume them at your own risk. Treasure rooms are marked by their gold outlines, and within them lies a single power-up. These power-ups can increase your speed, change your projectile type, increase your max HP, etc. Some power-ups are weak and their effects can leave more to be desired, while others can be complete game changers and turn the tide of battles in your favor. They’re creatively designed and include some pretty outlandish things like a pair of high heels and even dog food. They also change your physical appearance, and seeing as they stack infinitely, this can result in some pretty hilarious or gruesome appearances. As you progress throughout the game, Isaac’s exterior begins to reflect the hell that is the basement. There are a plethora of bosses and they all battle in different ways. Defeating a boss will open a trapdoor to the next level, and between each floor of the basement a cutscene plays that shows Isaac having a nightmare, often of him being publicly embarrassed. The cutscenes, although oddly humorous, add little depth to Isaac’s character as it can be assumed that the events he worries over never actually took place, seeing as some are pretty over-the-top, such as one where he dreams he was being pooped on by a group of people. The final boss is no other than Isaac’s mother. And even after you’ve managed to beat her, your adventure still isn’t over. There still remains another set of levels and a whole mess of enemies, secrets, items, and power-ups to find.Through and through, The Binding of Isaac is a bonafide roguelike in every sense of the term. Every dungeon is randomly generated, resulting in no two runs feeling exactly the same. You’re given simple controls and absolutely no tutorial of any sort. Like any self-respecting roguelike, this is a game of trial and error, and it isn’t afraid to hand you your behind on a silver platter. The staggering amount of enemies will force you to adapt to any situation, and you’ll find yourself dying often before you’ve learned most of the enemies’ maneuvers. Bosses deal a lot of damage fast and some will even spawn smaller enemies around themselves. Even after you’ve learned the behavior of every enemy in the game, you’ll still find yourself dying quite often. Useable items and power-ups add variation to the gameplay and the tactics you’ll use in combat. With the unbelievable amount of depth found in the seemingly simple game, The Binding of Isaac produces an experience that becomes insanely addictive and rarely feels stale, even after dozens of hours of playtime.The Binding of Isaac’s visual presentation is something straight from the mind of a madman. Its art style is sleek, simple, and endearing. The various brown hues of the basement stand apart from each other, enhanced by the excellent shading, but they’re just pieces in a whole that create an immersive and beautiful environment. The story is primarily told through Isaac’s drawings. It’s all nice and cutesy, that is until you actually walk around and see the dreadful conditions of the basement. A myriad of deformed and bloody enemies stalk the rooms and each seem to spout blood like a fountain upon dying. There are these worm-like enemies that actually look somewhat adorable, until they charge at you with their fangs bared, trying to eat your face off. Piles of poop lay scattered on the ground. The changes that accompany the power-ups can be humorous, but others completely change the way Isaac looks, essentially turning him into one of the monsters that he faces. The fact that you aren’t alone suggests that you aren’t the first to face the wickedness of Isaac’s mother, and the possibility that the enemies could be related to him makes the adventure even more cringe worthy. In some dungeons you’ll find a room in which you can purchase items in exchange for coins. Each of these shops feature a hanging Isaac-lookalike, their faces twisted with expressions of despair. It’s an enthralling visual endeavor that shocks you from the start and carries out its dark themes with precise execution.The Binding of Isaac’s soundtrack aims to emphasize the same contrast brought about by the art style, and it manages to do so quite well. The music is slightly upbeat and detracts from the hopelessness that Isaac feels as he wanders through the basement. At times the music speeds up just a bit and the volume increases, ramping up your adrenaline at the same time. There is a slight feeling of loneliness in the unknown created by the soundtrack, and this is where it slightly fractures the contrast and actually melds with the setting. Enemy and projectile sounds are squishy in nature, but impactful overall. The contrast between the game’s dark themes and relatively uplifting music is genuinely interesting and adds another layer of depth.Despite its numerous references and tie-ins to other forms of media, The Binding of Isaac does plenty to set itself apart from the pack. There are some really laughable moments in the otherwise grim depths of the basement: there’s a certain enemy that will scurry away from you, whimpering as it tries desperately to flee; of the hanging Isaac-lookalikes in the shops, one of them has a huge grin on his face; some of the items and power-ups are just meant to make you burst out laughing, like Mom’s Pad – a useable item that makes all enemies in a room retreat for several seconds. Also, it raises some very serious questions that most games wouldn’t dare ask. It ventures into often-untraveled territory by challenging our understanding of organized religion, mental illness, and child abuse. These are very touchy subjects and it’s admirable to see developers who aren’t afraid to speak on them. The Binding of Isaac proves to be a unique and addictive adventure. Its humor is welcoming and its roguelike nature results in an unbelievable amount of replay value. While it may look simple at first, there is a surprising amount of depth to be found. Its endearing art style and aesthetically pleasing soundtrack is welcoming, while its dark themes are perfectly executed in the story and character designs. More than just a fun game, it questions what we as a society perceive to be norms and challenges us to think differently. The only real downsides to the game are the lack of characterization on Isaac and the slight capitalization on nostalgia. Aside from that, it’s an incredible game that should be played by anyone who enjoys a solid roguelike – or just a good game in general – because it stands head and shoulders above its competition in the genre.

												Okay, I guess since this is the most played game I have on my library, I've got some things to say about it. First of all, the game can be really hard on new players, but within a few hours you'll find yourself dwelling deeper into the depths of the basement (literally). The randomness of rooms, enemies and items you get each time really adds up for the replay, which is basically infinite. You feel challenged, sometimes a little unfairly, but most of the times, you're the only responsible for your success or defeat. It's very hard to put into words how much I enjoy playing this game. Each time you beat the game, it expands even more, and there's also challenges to complete, secrets to find, endings to discover, and to top all of that, a huge set of achievements to unlock, which will take your time very good. So, if you want a game that it's challenging, time-consuming and addictive, you can't go wrong for such a small price. And be sure to get the Wrath of the Lamb DLC as well.			"

												This is THE game.Now, for me discovering ang getting into Isaac was totally a suprise. I normally like games with outstanding artwork or very beautiful story or an amazing combination of both; basically what you could call: light, easy (maybe more women-orientated) games. BUT, Isaac has nothing to do with that and even so it has become one of my favorite games ever.It is dark, very simple and straight-forward (from minute one you control you character a 100%). You move: up, down, left, right.You shoot: up, down, left, right. (you shoot tears, how sad is that)Also you have two other commands: bombs, and special items. And there you go, trying to survive in a basement full of♥♥♥♥♥♥ spiders and worse things to suprise you, looking for your mother so you can kill her before she kills you. What I really like of this game is that there is not only one ending. You have to finish it over and over to get new items, achievements, characters and more difficult levels. But it doesn't get boring (or at least nor for me) as it changes continously and it is always unpredictable. After months of playing to Isaac I am about to get all the achievements (it might take me another month) and I hope by then they release the second part. It is going to be awesome.			"

												Absolutely amazing for enarly any fan of a platformer game or a randomly-generated RPG-esque game. I won't go too in-depth, but each level, the pick ups, and even the rooms are randomly generated. That gives it an AMAZING replay value (I've already beaten it twice). I definitely recommend the Wrath of the Lamb DLC as well once you purchase the base game. Adds a lot more items, bosses, level variations, and other hidden goodies worth the $3 or so. It's only $8 for the base game plus the WotL add-on. Even if you aren't sure you want the full game, plenty of let's plays on YouTube and eben a demo version in the link below of the first two levels if you want to play it a bit yourself. Most definitely recommend this little gem.http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/581168 "

												The Binding of Isaac. So much I could possibly say about it. Let me start off by saying I have played this for about a full 2 days time (48 hours) and I have loved almost every second of it. Now that that is out of the way let me state the reasons I like it and a couple of things that I want in Rebirth. By the way I'm also talking about the DLC for this game in the review also so make note of that.Positives:The Graphics. The graphics in this game are just great.The items. The game has so many items, there are still probably a ton I haven't found.The difficulty. The game is purely skill based. The only time luck is involved is what you will get from rerolling and the slots.The enemies. Sure you got flies and spiders which aren't that great, but then you delve deeper and find all sorts of horrors.The creativity. The game just oozes creativity.The story. I just like the story.Negatives:-Lemon Mishap and Wiggle Worm. These are two items I just can't stand. Lemon Mishap spawns are small circle around you which makes you move slightly faster. Wiggle Worm makes your shots move around like the Medusas in Castlevania, usually missing your enemies.-No save mechanic. I understand that it was made in flash, and that saving will be in Rebirth, but I'm just warning you.-Sometimes you need a bomb to get a bomb. This is just a little pet peeve but in some rooms a bomb is surrounded by rocks, which means you have to use a bomb to get a bomb. It's just pointless and wastes time. Sometimes it's a double bomb which is fine because you gain, but sometimes it's a single bomb.That's about it. I would give it a 9/10. It's an extremely creative and fun dungeon crawler. Every game is different and requires skill. I would reccomend you buy it, and if you like it, maybe even Rebirth. By the way if the creator of Rebirth is reading this please don't change the graphics. I've seen what the new ones look like and I just really prefer these ones. I'm still going to get it regardless though. "

Cry or DieA former shell of a boy turned lump-of-flesh, Isaac must endure the horrors of lost siblings that never came to be. These undead fetuses are hellbent on destroying Isaac's very way of living and are very angry, that is to say, not only at him but at his mother even more so. Mom receives a godsend message from the Lord one day, asking her to prove her devotion and faith by sacrificing her son, Isaac. Who knows if his late brothers and sisters suffered the same fate, but one thing's for certain, Isaac isn't going to wait to find out!Overall, the top-down arcade style of The Binding of Isaac is great fun to be had. The levels are generated at random each time, and knowing this, makes for high replay value... from an indie game no doubt! Enemies are unique in appearance, there are various items with special capabliities, and plus, you take down your foes by crying a surge of tear drops! Poor Isaac... more fun for us then!			"

												This game is one of the greatest games I have ever played. It sort of reminds me of old school Zelda dungeons mixed with Super Meat Boy (but that's just because it's the same creator which gives it the same art style). This game literally has an infinite replay value. It takes a little while to get used to it, and may require a lot of practice, but there is a MAJOR feeling of gratitude once you kill mom (you'll understand once you play it). And if you think it stops after that, you are painfully wrong. There is a DLC that EVERYONE should buy day one. It makes the game nearly impossible to beat...nearly. This game deserves all the praise it reseves. 10/10, definetly buy. Plus, it's like 5 bucks, that's practically nothing for an unlimited amount of fun!			"

												The Binding of Issac is an awesome dungeon crawler where you play as Issac who tries to escape his mom who was told by God that Issac was overwhelmed by sin and to kill him. Issac escapes and must make it out of the dungeon with many monsters and powerups on the way. This game is very bloody and gory, however, it is alot of fun and very intense. It all goes around the bible and has many references torwards it. Also, you can become the devil, grow wings, shoot blood instead of tears, I know right, and beat the game with multiple characters. There are secret rooms, deals with the devil, is randomly generated, and has multiple bosses.I reccomend this game to anyone who can take blood and gore and not easily be offended by ammount of references torwards the bible. I rate it an 8/10			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a twin stick shooter roguelike. You play as Isaac, a little boy trying to escape his ridiculously religious mother that believes god wants her to kill her son. So he runs into the basement, going deeper and deeper, to escape her. You can move in eight directions and fire in four directions. You go through a series of square rooms similar in style to that of a Zelda dungeon from NES. You fight enemies in the rooms and get rewards for doing so. You might find keys for opening doors and chests. You might find bombs for blowing up rocks, walls, or enemies. You might find coins to spend in shops. And you might find shops, treasure rooms, or treasure chests filled with secondary items, powerups, or just some more health. There are a few unique rooms like challenge rooms where you get treasure for fighting some waves of enemies. Some rooms let you sacrifice a random amount of health for a power up. Some rooms even let you trade your total permanent hearts for powerups. These powerups are the main draw of the game, as they can change your stats and give you any number of strange powers or passives. It's tough and you're going to die, but death just means you get to start fresh and see what kind of new things await you in the randomly generated game. There are even a few characters to pick from and a series of challenges you can try out. PLUS a big batch of DLC in one great package to add even MORE things into the random mix of fun.This game suffers from its randomness. It's certainly the appeal, but if you get dealt a bad hand of powerups then you just have to deal with it. Lots of skill can make up for it, but sometimes it feels very unfair because it's random. It's troublesome to go grab for a powerup only to have it actually power you DOWN instead. Also, the tears you shoot can be hard to aim because they have a bit of an arc to when they are in the air and when they land, which isn't the easiest thing to gauge in a top down 2D environment. Hitboxes can also be a bit hard to tell sometimes due to the rounded, somewhat squishy style of the characters. Also... while the game does direct you to the program suggested for making controller support, there's not controller support in the game itself. Why not just add in controller support in a later patch? That's a minor annoyance but... it's annoying.The thing that makes this game so great is that you can play it over and over and over again and it's different every time. There's so much content here for the price of 5 bucks it's insane. It's an amazing buy for one of your first Steam games, especially on a budget because there's lots here. And the DLC is reasonable if you want even more content. The challenges and characters and item combinations all make for endless possibilities. Your run can take five minutes or two hours. There are multiple endings too so the replay value is through the roof. I can't recommend it enough. The Binding of Isaac gets an 8 out of 10. I hear Rebirth is good... maybe I'll be able to play it someday.			"

												the ratio of initail cost to amount of play time you can get out of Binding of isaac is better than any other game in the world (apart from f2p games i suppose). worth getting it no matter what the price. the art style is amazing and the depth of the game is fantastic for the restrictions of Flash. 9/10			"

Firs off, the gameplay is so old-school yet so rewarding and satisfying that reminds you of the classic Legend of Zelda games. The graphics are 2D but the amazing and beautiful art style make up for it. The sound as well as the soundtrack are great too. To be honest, I can't really complain about this game, it's amazing and almost anyone can fall in love with it right away. I'm actually addicted to it and can't stop playing it. I recommend it even at full price.			"

												For me, one of my all time favorite games was Legend of Zelda on the NES.  Binding of Isaac takes the feel of that original cartridge game and gives it a scatalogical overhaul.  With a difficulty level approaching some of the toughest platformer and shooting games I've ever played, it's a serious game despite it's immature slant.  The randomly generated dungeons lead you to earning meta-acheivments, meaning each time you play you aren't necessarily playing to win, but to unlock something for your next run.The randomness of the game is a feature and also highly frustrating.  Sometimes you get bad items on the first level or two, and you just know you have no chance to win that run.  Yet you reset the game and keep playing. Ultimately I find myself booting this game up more then any other steam game though.  Despite it's difficulty I can play it for five minutes or five hours and I'm always treated to a great experience.   If you don't have Binding of Isaac yet, you're missing out.			"

												I'm not a fan of horror, I also get nauseous easy and panic easily. Binding of Isaac since it's debut was a game I mentally boxed as something other people with stronger mental fortitude play. It's creepy and disturbing, with a disarming art style and hearing the story second hand (And knowing the roots of Abraham and Isaac) did intrigue me but also made me uneasy. The Winter steam sale gave little more incentive for at least buying it, but I wouldn't recommending waiting for another sale, this game is immensely fun.There's a few games that walk, and talk like a horror like Gregory Horror Show and their ilk, which did put me off initially easily became a cult-classic, and this outclasses 'bubblegum goth' genre for quirky horror games. The game has little in way of a tutorial, and even less explanation of what every item does, but part of it's charm is exploration in a dark basement of the unknown and working things out for better or worse. Each run and level is randomly generated to keep you on your toes, there's various items that will help deal with the hideous enemies of Isaac's long-begotten and far less loved (or Lovely) siblings, of which they are legion and twisted in their variations. The game also while simple to grasp, does involve a deal of strategy later on; particularly when you find you can make a deal with the Devil for items that could turn the tide of your misfortune. Other more common rooms make such promises, that you'll need to crawl through a spiked door way to get to. Some items affect your primary weapon, which is a gag in itself, that you fight through the waves with your own tears. Give the game a simple test run, and you'll understand why this has unlimited ammo. The items also affect Isaac visually, and accumulating into making him just as horrifying as the abyss around him, and to be helpful: Even if you look like a Demon's Spermatozoa decked in black membrane with long, sharp gnashy teeth touching enemies will still kill you. I still have no idea why I thought I could eat them, .. but apparently this form gives me flight to get over ledges.Still Enjoy. "

												The Rogue-like game to end all Rogue-likes. A spooky story based on the bible, with plenty of dark undertones present in the items and enemies. Grab power-ups to strengthen your character, and then cry yourself to sleep when you lose them all because of a stupid spider. Not a whole lot of content, but what you get is worth every penny, including DLC. 10/10			"

												I haven't recommended this yet?Well, basically, even for a guy like me who isn't usually into the macabre and creepy style this kind of game exudes, you end up becoming so addicted that none of it matters.  The unique feel of each run despite going down the technically-same labyrinth over and over is surprising, and the amount of stuff to do is just ridiculous.			"

 ""Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, (...) and threw himself down into the unknown depths below."" A kind of game that I(and probably a lot of other gamers) really like- a game where it has great gameplay, combined with deep and great story.The entire story is a satire about a bible story The Binding of Issac, where Abraham tried to sacrifice his son Issac because he heard(or thought he heard) a voice from the God. The Binding of Issac(video game), BoI for short, has a similiar story, but is set in a more modern setting.Issac(not that Issac from before) and his mother(name not revealed) lived in a small house. While Issac played with his toys, his mom watched Christian broadcasts from the TV. One day, his mom thought she heard a voice from the God, and he ordered her to kill Issac to prove her devotion. Issac, heard all of it and tried to escape. He found a trapdoor to his basement, and the game begins with him jumping down to it.McMillen wanted to show the positive yet the nagative affects of the game's developer Edmund McMillen had from the Scripture. McMillen makes a lot of dark humour and satire based games, and most of his creativity with the story of those games came from his Catholic mother and grandmother, and he thanks them for that. But his Christian dad was harsh on him, saying that playing games such as Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons will lead him to hell.McMillen tried to tell this bible's positive effects and nagative effects on a child. It is very interesting, and it is even more so that even though 3 years have passed since the launch of this game, a solid explanation to the game's story hasn't been found yet. This was intended, as McMillen wanted this game to have many interpretations of it's endings, just like the Scripture.Now, to the gameplay aspects- it's a roguelike with some real-time aspect, combined with basic Legend of Zelda dungeon structure. The game has insane replay values, with over 100(or 200) items in the game, and 70(or more) of them is all stackable. You can trie out new combos with different enemies and bosses, such as combining a rapid fire laser weapon with a item that lets you charge, or combining a item which lowers your range but increases your damage with a weapon that inscreases your range.The game is lot like Zelda in this aspect where you don't know what things does until you try them out. The game also drops you bombs, keys, coins and health in various rooms, which is much like Zelda as well.The soundtrack is amazing, Danny Baranowsky did a fantastic job. It's one of those soundtracks that you would download to your phone or iTunes.This aspects makes this game really addicting, with you always telling to yourself ""What will I get this time?"". These games that makes you excited everytime you launch your game is a proof of a great game.The Binding of Issac definitely deserves an 8/10- it's a great game. I saw people saying this game is bad because it's too 'hard'. But that's the core mechanic of the game, you need to retry and see what happens next time. That's the general concept of a rogue-like. Some says that this game's only fun is it's item-combining aspects, but that's not true. If you look deeply into it's story as well, you will find it very interesting. The game's fun also comes from not only the Zelda aspects, but also from the rogue-like aspects.Unfortunately, The Binding of Issac is not a masterpiece(9/10). I want it to be, but I just feel like there's something missing here. Maybe it will be a masterpiece in The Binding of Issac: Rebirth, a remake to this game, which will not be made in 3 mouths. Yay.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is an amazing game that mixes elements from The Legend of Zelda dungeon crawling all the way to games like Minecraft with it's randomization. In the Binding of Isaac, you play as a small boy called, Issac who is chased down into the basement of his house due to his Mother believing that she is hearing the voice of God.      You can collect many different types of Weapons in the Binding of Isaac. Ranging from arrows, to bombs, to stranger things such as ipecac, to brimstone, to chocolate milk! There more items than just weapons. You can collect things that will aid you on your journey such as dog food (Additional health), and Pyro (You grow fuses in your head that give you 99 bombs). There is a great diversity of items in the game and it is very unlikely that you will get the same items in next playthroughs.     Now, all of these items don't mean much if the combat is bad. And it is not. Rooms are randomly generated and there is quite a selection of enemies to fight. All the enemies in the game serve a specific role to play. There are not many different types of bosses however in the game, which does mean that you repeat a boss that you fought in a previous run.     All in all, the binding of isaac is a great dungeon crawling game and plenty of randomization to make each run different.			"

												""If there are two people who I believe are going to save hardcore gaming, it's Hideki Kamiya and Edmund McMillen.""-SelfCreated behind the same mind that brought you Super Meat Boy, The Binding of Isaac is a randomly-generated dungeon crawler with light rpg elements present and constant action. Set in a twisted atmosphere with dark themes ranging from child abuse, gender identity, suicide, abortion and how religion might negatively affect a child, you play as Isaac; a child who is relentlessly being hunted by his mother, who believes her son is corrupted by sin and must sacrifice him to prove her love to her god after hearing his voice. The game can be brutal at moments, due to not knowing how the game is played and randomly generated levels. However, the longer you play the game, the better you will understand how the game is played and where secrets are placed, what the items do and attack patterns your enemies display. It instructs you with trial and error gameplay and it's random but understandable level design. This is easily one of the best designed games I've ever played, and look forward to the remake of this game.Since this is a flash game,however, expect to have random framerate crashes, as the game is packed with so much content there will be moments where the game will slow down and may even stop responding.If you are a fan of the NES Legend of Zelda dungeioneering and/or a challenging game with a test of wits and reflexes, this is for you.

												Well, considering I recently logged my 100th hour, I figured I would write a review.What can I say about this game? Well...anyone who asks me, I tell them that it's the wierdest game you'll ever see. Perhaps that's not entirely true, but it's rather close.Isaac is a rouguelike that is probably the hardest game that I've ever played. It's incredably frustraiting to simply play it for fun, but thankfully the game has nice tiers of bosses to defeat, and some bosses are just simply rewarding to kill due to their difficulty.Anyone new to the game will die, and any veteran will die often as well. The game is unforgiving and, as I said, incredibly difficult. One aspect that I don't like is it's heavily RNG, but the game does kinda adress that once you've beat it a few times *cough10-15cough*I honestly don't know why I still play it. I think it's because the challenge itself allures me, and the fact that I have 100 hours there's still so much to do. The game has a few gates requiring you to beat it again in order to proceed, and that's what i like about it. If you don't like difficulty, anger, and death, don't buy this. But if you're willing to struggle through and recieve the great feeling of awesomeness when you succeed after 200 runs, then this is for you.			"

												This game...This game is many things, at most times though, it feels like an abusive spouse; it lures you in with lovely goodies and maybe even a deal with the devil if you want to vomit blood, and then, it sticks you in a room with fifteen floating heads shooting blood at you... you come back the next day.Personally, while im not exactly good at this game, i like it, but i hate it just as much. Ive ragequit from this game every day since its purchase, and i keep coming back for more.There`s a bit of a learning curve, most is knowing what a card or pill does, because they can harm you, and will if you`re not careful. You also want to know the enemy types and create strategies. Its almost like Dark Souls in a sense, especially when you consider the lore.There is a ton of story and lore if you just look a little bit between the lines, very deep messages about issac present and past conditions. There`s a youtuber, i believe he is named vaati vidya, that goes into depth about this and the game in general, i suggest checking him out.			"

												you know what this game's all about: exploration, rogue-like stuff and more. But is it fun? Yes it even holds up today, rebirth is of course the better version but I always see them as two completly different things, the original has a certain style. So much fun, before you know it you have sunk 30 hours into it.			"

												You wont regret getting this game, I can guarantee it.. Different runs everytime, it could be frustrating at first but you'll enjoy more and more as you dig into the game.. Game is funny, has a great art style and actually a great story (you may not get the story by yourself but you can look it up in the internet).. The game is enough on its own but with the dlc you'll get like 100 more items which doubles the fun but as i said game is enough on its own.. And I'll give it a 10/10.Now we only need to wait for the Rebirth.. "

												A beautifully morbid game. It gives a ton of cheap laughs, provides intensely challenging gameplay and grants a sense of achomplishment if you can survive.The models are creatively designed, a good deal of the enemies are uniquely designed, and the fact that the game has dozens upon dozens of items to collect makes it a new, fun playthrough every time.

												Okay here's what I got from the plot so far:You are an young boy who gets bullied a lot, your dad left you and your mom is neglecting you to watch christian broadcast. Due to the religious background that your mom instilled in your education, you are having trouble setting borders between reality and fiction, but you manage to stay sane by focussing on drawing. However, when mom gets a vision (which can be explained by the pills in her purse you find later) she locks you up in a room without anything to do (including drawing), which slowly drives you to insanity. After mom gets her last vision she will try to murder you, but you manage to escape moms psychotic rage by jumping into the hatch to the basement. The basement is a representation of your fears, in which you have to cry away the monsters, geneticly manipulate your body and mind, make a pact with the devil, and face your fears, so you are ready to kill your mother at the end of your insane quest.But at what cost will you survive,,,?10/10: Fun for the whole family			"

												The Binding of Isaac is pretty fun if you enjoy trial and error learning. The randomness of each dungeon also adds to the creativity and really emphasizes every decision you make.Look up the wiki for the game, keeping tabs on the item/trinket pages at all times.Cain is my favorite character to use.

												The Binding of Isaac looks and feels like a flash game; something you could play for free online. It looks like someone had an idea, said ""hey, wouldn't this be cool?"" and made it.But if you can get past that, The Binding of Isaac is surprisingly thorough. It's a Roguelike - you die, you start again. You gather items and powerups in order to ramp up your character and clear the dungeon. And boy are there a lot of items; it wasn't until at the very least my fifth playthrough that I started to see repeats at all, and according to the wiki, there are dozens of things left to discover.That being said, there's no way to see what some of these items actually do before using them. The tarot cards which are usually one-time effects have consistent effects through all playthroughs, but there's so many of them it's hard to remember. There's multitudes of passive collectables you could potentially find which end up helping you create a 'build', and you never know what you'll get (or what they even do, if they require an activation).Despite finding multitudes of what I thought were ""broken OP"" items, the difficulty in this game is fairly high, and despite at least twenty attempts, I've only managed to beat the game once. And like any Roguelike game, exploration, while rewarding, is extremely dangerous! Unlike a game such as FTL where you are encouraged to finish every encounter you can in order to build up enough power, Isaac's hard limit on healing items forces players to rethink trying to explore the entire dungeon, and for once, NOT exploring can sometimes be the tactical choice.The game produces mountains of tough little choices. Do you permanently lower your health for a good item? Which active ability is best to keep, since you can only have one? Do you go through the spiked door where you will take guaranteed damage for a shot at loot? Do you use your key on the chest in front of you, or is there a shop down the road that can help you unload cash?Unfortunately, these decisions are sometimes uninformed. Again, without a way to see what an item does before picking it up, experimentation is required. This can be painful when you are asked to pay a health container or two before even figuring out what it does, or you activate something that teleports you, or some other unexpected event.If you can handle the sort of gross nature of the environment, this is a Roguelike which'll keep you busy for a few hours.

												The Binding of Isaac is a  Roguelike [en.wikipedia.org] Adventure game similar to the Legend of Zelda. Each run the player is confronted with a randomly generated arrangement of rooms containing a wide variety of enemies and traps. Each stage is completed by defeating a boss that has unique abilities. Throughout the run your character becomes stronger by acquiring upgrades. Once dead you have to start back at stage one meaning there is minimal progression outside of becoming more skilled and unlocking more items.The Binding of Isaac is an excellent example of a well executed modern Roguelike, although you may consider waiting for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth which will free the game from the limiting Flash engine which is one of Isaac's biggest flaws.

												The Rogue-like game to end all Rogue-likes. A spooky story based on the bible, with plenty of dark undertones present in the items and enemies. Grab power-ups to strengthen your character, and then cry yourself to sleep when you lose them all because of a stupid spider. Not a whole lot of content, but what you get is worth every penny, including DLC. 10/10			"

												Randomly generated good times full of disgust, horror, and a few really good chuckles. If you like raunchy comedy, and you like video games The Binding of Isaac has got what you want. In this game you play foremost as Isaac. A poor child who has been shut away from all worldly pleasures and is about to be sacrificed. All thanks to Isaac's mother who hears voices. Voices of what she believes is God telling her to do these things. Which is an obvious reference to the story of Isaac from the Bible in the 22nd Chapter of Genesis (Hey now you know). In the game you retreat from your bloodthirsty mother into the basement (the entrance to which is located convieniently in Isaac's room). There you will fight against the demons that haunt the house using little but your own tears (no really his weapon is crying) and your ablility to dodge moderatley fast enemys and projectiles. Learn the secrets, make a deal with the devil (or two), collect the power-ups, and confront your mother for your very life.Pros:+One of the most strangely addicting games I've ever played+Replay value is immense+Funny (for the right audience) and packed full of references to pop-culture and internet memes+Doesn't take a powerful computer to run it (most laptops should be able to handle it even)+Totally affordable at $5. (Personally I got it on sale with the dlc for under a dollar)+Soundtrack is notably well done. A lot of love went into the score of this gameCons:-It's got a fairly steep learning curve-Luck can be a defining factor-Sometimes it can become unreasonably offensive to the more sensitive audience (I personally like the humor but I know people who I would not show this game to) All in all I'd give it a solid 85/100			"

												Extremely addictiveDifficult without being cheap about itOutstanding visual styleA combination of a twisted sense of humor and a little bit of pathosGreat amount of new items showing up on a regular basis (you really need to get the DLC)Great value (with my 470+ hours playing and eight bucks full price for the game + expansion, that's about 60 hours per dollar)Play this game!

												This is a great game for people who like mazes and adventure rpg.I would not recomend for people who arent good at games, because this game you have to be smart and dodge bullets.I made the mistake of buying the dlc and the game at the same time, so i cant beat it unless i try really hard.

												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is great. This is my go-to game for when I only have short periods of time to kill and don't have time to really dive into a game all the way. It's a fantastic game with endless replayability and I hope to upgrade to Rebirth as soon as I can.			"

												The Game ""The Binding of Isaac"" is very good and a bit difficult that it's one of the favorite indie games since Super Meat Boy (Which is made by the same person).  If you choose Maggy after you defeat MOM using the character Isaac that it's unlock, you get 4 heart containers and a heart you carry can restore 1 heart meter.  the MOM boss is only part like eyes, a leg and hand (that you need to stay away).  this is basically combined The legend of Zelda, And Robotron 2080.  My favorite Boss is Monstro who barfs drops of blood which can hurt you and jumps high and lands down, splattered blood all over the place. Isaac's weapon is only tears that you need to kill enemys to pick up coins to buy, bombs and keys even pills that cause diarrhea, or restore your heart meter.  Don't forget training cards! the trading cards are very useful to warp places, getting items and defeating enemies.  The giftshop is use to buy items using pennies that you have like a stepladder, books and hearts.  The arena stage is that you can enter that you have a full HP, If you open the chest and you get the items, enemies will pop out and you need to kill it.  Keys are used to open doors, chests and blocks. The special door that holds a special item that you need to upgrade tears, damage, rage, and speed even special attacks.  Bombs are use to blow up walls for secret rooms that lots of pennies, Boulders for bridges and enemy barriers.  That's why my rating for this Indie/Adventure game is 8.7/10.  Thanks for Reviewing for this game.  Bye                                                                                                                                           KirbyMaster16 :)			"
