VVVVVV is about going up and down. You go up to avoid some obstacles and go down to land safely between spikes. I have to mention that controls are very simple - left, right, swap gravity. There is open map that allows you to complete levels in custom order. Great retro style soundtrack included. I should mention that in this game you have to understand the gravity of the situation. "

												VVVVVV is a platformer. Are you surprised yet? You shouldn't. On with the review:This game has caught my attention when it appeared on the Nintendo E-Shop on 2012. Being the person I was, I downloaded the $5 game (on the 3DS that eventually got stolen in 2014). It was worth every buck. The plot is very simple and quite complex when digging for a backstory.Let's focus on the basic right now: You are Captain Viridian. Your crew has been seperated in a strange, and facinating universe. And it is your job as captain to save them from the unknown dangers of this unknown world. With the power to flip upside-down, you can explore places where you thought never was possible. That's all you have for a power really: no attack, no special combat mechanics, just flipping. However it's all you need besides skill in this game: as everything can be avoided and can be done without dying a single time (no joke, everything is. I dare you to get the ""Master of the Universe"" achivement.). Along the way, you may find ""Shiny Trinkets"". These come to a good use after beating the game..after collecting all 20 (forget what I said earlier about ""not dying"". One of them requires you to activate a specific checkpoint and suicide.). I'm not going to list them or spoil anything since the steam community already did (plus this is a review, not a strategy guide).There are 4-5 (depends if you count the Lab areas as one area or two different sections) major areas in the game (not counting the transmission levels or the final level) all that can be accessed from the very large overworld in any order you like (minus the Transmission and Final levels). This brings for a total of 7-8 Levels in the entire game. Again, you have 20 Trinkets hidden in this entire world to search for along the way.The music & presentation is just excellent with everything being retro, and it gives that Atari vibe really well. Still, the music is just awesome! Souleye did a great job with creating the wonderful soundtrack for this game, as well as the 3 songs added in one of the updates. In fact many people have claimed the soundtrack to be the best part of the game. (Hint hint, tag on the game)It's mechanics are quite simple to grasp, such as moving platforms, vasnishing platforms, enemies, you know: the usual. The new comes in with the Warps. There are two types. One where you enter the side of a room, you are teleported to the exact other side. The other is a portal. Quite expected: you would be taken to a particular place in the world. You'll never know where it goes unless you used the portal once or twice.Must I say the Level Design is very fair, balanced at times, and very devious. How is all of this possible? Simple: Each area has their own ""special"" quality, including the transmission levels. The Lab, for example, focuses on Gravity Lines and you have to use these to do some flips you thought you wouldn't be able to do. The devious part comes in with some of the enemy placement, spike placement, and even the name of the room. Yes, every single room in the entire game has a name: which for me makes it more enjoyable. ""What tricks you have up your sleeve this time?"" However due to the game allowing you to access it's various levels at your leasure, it's hard to tell an accurate difficulty curve, especially with the varying mechanics thrown around. The transmission levels make up for the difficulty with one being an escort mission and the other throwing you into a survival challenge. The final level doesn't feel too hard, as you are having to apply what you learned, along with some mind-bending chaos. There is a good amount of extra content too: such as Time Trial mode (each time trial is unlocked after beating the actual level in-game), Flip Mode (after beating the game for the first time), player made levels that come with the game, and other levels that people in the community made..which brings me to the next topic: the Level Designer.You can create your dream levels of pure difficulty or possibly test out a few new things that can or cannot break the game. Again, you are the creator and stuff. Scripting is quite difficult to learn, but it's easy to input them once learned. And you have access to almost everything in the game. Checkpoints, various crew members, etc. So the levels are basically micro versions of the game, but customized to the max.In the end, VVVVVV is a classic game in my steam library that I was glad to experience once again. Would I advise someone like Jirard (aka ""The Completionist"") to play this game? If you are tough as nails and can handle the challenge of 100% Super Meat Boy (at the very least), this probably be another game down the cake walk. However this can be quite difficult for new players. If you are going to go as far as 100% the game, prepare to die..a lot. You will suffer if you attempt that no-death run. I've only done it ONCE. Just ONCE on my 3DS. Just don't go that far as I did. If your curious, I still love the game even after all of that torture I went through. I know, I am very insanely crazy. And I will likely be even more crazy over the next coming years.			"

Posted: January 15, 2016
												Time for a controversial review. I’ve played this game on and off for the past 5 years, and I’ve gradually come to realize it's not that great. I’ll try to explain why.To get one thing out of the way, the music is fantastic. The chiptune album “PPPPPP” is a true modern classic, catchy and energetic and well-produced. The game sells for $5, but I’d be willing to pay $20 for the soundtrack alone. It’s that good. Even after hearing these tunes for 5 years, most of them still haven’t gotten old to me. But chances are you’ve already heard the music and know this for yourself.To get another thing out of the way, I think the visuals are awesome. The minimalistic art throws back to a time older than the NES, and the ever-changing neon colors are strange and mysterious in their simplicity, and demand to be explored. In a way, the game itself is a fitting music video to one of the greatest chiptune albums there is.So, what do I dislike about this game? Well, where do I start…?The game is built around a novel idea – flipping the gravity of your character instead of jumping – and then spends an hour or two trying to pretend this mechanic has no crippling limitations before just giving up.  And I’m not exaggerating here: the entire game can be consistently beaten in about 30 minutes. The first time I played it, it took me about 50. Finding all the hidden trinkets can take about an hour more, depending on how many tries it takes you on the “Prize for the Reckless” and “Veni, Vidi, Vici” challenges.Most games which are built around a central gimmick will try to expand it with additional game mechanics. VVVVVV comes up with about four new mechanics to complement its gravity-flipping gimmick: conveyer belts, automatic-flip lasers, auto-scrolling rooms, and rooms that wrap around the edges. It then uses each of these mechanics in a tiny dungeon area and almost nowhere else. Two of the game’s areas use a somewhat irritating mechanic where you have to lead a friend around, with the level design poking fun at the fact that your friend has no common sense and you have to do everything for them. As far as new ideas are concerned, that’s pretty much it.The central hub area, which comprises the majority of the map, is mostly just empty space: no enemies, no platforming puzzles, nothing but a few spikes here and there and a few of the collectable trinkets hidden away in corners. Even the interesting mazes are scarce. The hopelessly catchy track “Passion for Exploring” plays in the central hub, but in this case, “exploration” means just repeatedly falling through dozens of empty screens and searching for the next dungeon entrance. The overworld is also littered with dozens of checkpoints and teleporters which you will never use because there’s just nothing out there. They could have removed it entirely, replacing the hub with a series of teleporters to the dungeons, and the game hardly would have lost anything.The game is touted as a “super hard” and “tough as nails” platformer. If that’s the case, it’s the easiest “super hard” platformer I’ve ever played. Some parts are hard, but there’s no steady sense of progression; the difficulty is mostly just limited to a few problem rooms which may take hundreds of deaths each, but otherwise the whole game is smooth sailing. If you want real difficulty, you can try no-death mode or the time trials, but it just amounts to repeatedly playing the same ridiculously short game until you get it perfect. In this case, the difficulty is mostly just self-imposed rather than the work of a level designer. Personally, I’ve spent the most amount of time on the Super Gravitron, a fearsomely difficult mini-game that was probably the spiritual precursor to Super  Hexagon.The game’s story might as well not be there. I can summarize the story as follows: “You are some kind of captain of some kind of crew piloting some kind of ship, which crash-lands on some kind of planet due to some kind of disturbance. In order to escape, you need to deactivate some kind of device located in some kind of alternate dimension.” I’m not exaggerating. Nothing is explained. This story could have been mysterious and compelling, but instead it chooses to go the “self-referential humor” route by having the characters poke fun at checkpoints and the level design, while they’re not busy talking about nothing.And for those who say “Why would you play this game for the story?” I propose that you consider this: the game’s story could have been better if you removed all of the dialogue. The story is told perfectly through the visuals. The explosions, lost crew members, and alternate dimensions are all self-explanatory, and it would have left all the details up to the imagination. Captain Viridian would have made a great silent protagonist that you could have projected your own motivation into. Instead, the characters are all given completely needless speaking lines which don’t convey anything, and I’m just left wondering why anyone bothered to write dialogue.TL,DR: Aside from the superb music and the visuals, VVVVVV feels like a game that was hastily thrown together. The difficulty is schizophrenic, rather than a fine-tuned progression curve. The overworld map is mostly empty space, as though the level designer had tried filling it with enemies and mazes but finally said “screw it, nothing works” and deleted everything. The story had no effort behind it. Interesting game mechanics are few and far between, and are only used for a few rooms each. The bonus game modes are needless masochism that are far too great of a difficulty jump from the main game. Overall, it feels more like an hour-long proof of concept than a full-fledged game exploring the possibilities and implications of its main gravity-flipping gimmick.Yes, it was influential. Yes, it rode the very first wave of indie games back when Steam was gaining steam. Yes, the music is crazy good. All things considered, I respect this game. But after five years of playing and reflecting on it, I can’t help but see it as a short, pointless waste of time with no interesting gameplay statements to make (even for its time) and no heart put into it. It’s style-over-substance. But hey, it’s got a great style, so I can’t quite fault it for that. I know a lot of people love this game. I loved it for a while, but now that I've noticed its flaws I can't shake the sour taste this game leaves me with.I know that few will agree with my sentiment, but hopefully I’ve explained my thoughts adequately.And finally, all achievement hunters but the most dedicated should stay far, far away. This is one brutal 100%.			"

												VVVVVV takes you back in time. Back to a time where games where simple, and didn't require any messy story, or fancy visuals to impress you. A time where gameplay was the number 1 priority, and king of games.This is not a bad thing. Quite the opposite, actually.With addicting, spot on retro style gameplay and visuals, VVVVVV is hard to put away.And the amazing soundtrack really puts the nail in the coffin.			"

												VVVVVV is perhaps the most fun I've ever had being tortured with a game this side of Super Meat Boy.It's a sublime DOS inspired platformer where inverting the gravity has replaced your jump button, requiring you to completely rethink how you approach a level. Platforms are setup in a way that require incredibly precise, conscious flips and movement to surpass, at times feeling almost impossibly difficult. But VVVVVV is never unfair, offering you an abundance of checkpoints and excessively precise controls that caused me to surprise myself with what I was capable of. The nonlinear design also allows you to opt out of some of the most challenging rooms, or revisit them later when you feel better in tune with the game. Completing the game will test your mettle regardless, but the sense of accomplishment and the ever present feeling that you can possibly surpass any challenge given just one more time makes it impossible to give up and extremely rewarding when you do eventually succeed (though all the same, ""Doing it the hard way"" will forever haunt my nightmares).VVVVVV's vision is so strong and consistent, that even though the experience lasts only a few hours it was so incredibly fun and well put together that I never noticed the short length as I was simply having too good a time getting my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me again and again. That's probably a peculiar way to recommend a game, but VVVVVV is something of a peculiar game, coming out of essentially nowhere, putting blisters on my fingers, and making me curse and rejoice over and over while what can only be described as the best music to ever enter your ear holes played in the background.It's good, so just play it already won't you?!You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Very frustrating and in a way similar to Super Meat Boy (not really, but it's retro fun with infinite tries), VVVVVV has a very old school soundtrack, graphics and gameplay.It's all about fun and not about cutscenes, story or polish (not that there's necessarily something wrong with all that). VVVVVV manages like few games to capture that fun element, as long as you have some patience. (I personally like it even more than Super Meat Boy... I think.)			"

												VVVVVV is an amazing journey through space and a mystical dimension trying to desperately save your friends and get back home safely. The gameplay is excellent and the retro graphics really make an impact even in their simplicity. This is by no means a long game. In fact I finished it in less than two hours in my first serious try. The thing is, you shouldn’t really expect anything else from the game. It’s a super fun bite-sized goodie with a lot to offer if you just give it a chance. The game is pretty simple and straight forward. There aren’t many mechanics but mastering the few there are is a challenge in itself. The soundtrack by Magnus (SoulEye) Pålsson is magnificent. It keeps you pumped up for the action and keeps the flow of the game up even if you happen to die 50 times in a single room. Overall, if you like retro platformers, this is a must buy. It’s not quite a masterpiece contender since the length barely gets you started with the game and the gameplay is super simplistic. Still, you’ll definitely get your money’s worth out of VVVVVV.			"

												One of the most brilliant games I've ever played. Don't let the retro style fool you, the game is as far from taking the easy route design-wise as possible. The levels are well designed and offer optional challenges for even the most hardcore completionists/masochists. The flip-flop control scheme works perfectly, and the levels are designed around it, not thrown together to accomodate it.The atmosphere is fantastic, the Commodore-ish visuals and sound actually manage to create a pretty spooky world, although I'd say the challenging difficulty has something to do with that too.The only thing I wish this game had is Steam achievements, as it definitely is a great game to complete 100%.Right now it's on sale for 30 cents, so I see absolutely no reason not to buy this game instead of a few Steam trading cards. And even at the $3 full price it's worth every penny.			"

That being said: VVVVVV is the greatest game I have played in the last year.If you've played platformers, and consider youself a fan of challenges: This is the game for you. It's Dark Souls meets Megaman meets mario meets techno. The music will haunt your dreams.I want this game to never end... but unfortunately, it does.My only complaint is that it ends too soon. Get this game. Enjoy it. Challenge your friends to finish your favorite part. Brag about finishing it.Love it. Love every moment of it.			"

												Before I played this game, I thought that it was going to be a very simple game with a few levels. Oh how I was wrong. VVVVVV has a whole story where you, as the captain of  a spaceship, must find and save all your missing crew members. Each step of the way there is a creative level, each one being very challenging. Futhermore, there are a total of 20 'trinkets' which you can (try) to collect, some of which took me 100s of tries before I finally got them.Each level is named in a lightheartedly funny way and the soundtrack really helps to quash any fustration the immense difficulty of the game brings. Even after you finish the rather short main game, there is so much more to do with the inclusion of time trials and a 'flipped mode'.Overall, this game is a short yet very sweet retro adventure that is both difficult to play and rewarding to complete.10/10			"

												This is the best platformer released in the last decade. There's absolutely no fat. Mechanics are introduced, tested, refined, developed, plumbed, and discarded within 10 minutes, and it feels totally organic. The open world feels even better than Super Metroid, and the individual world-segments are beautifully self-contained. Every single platforming puzzle works. It doesn't overstay its welcome; it has about 3-4 hours worth of content, and that's exactly how long it'll take you. Every screen makes your grin wider as you realize that, yes, they did just pull that trick out of the bag. There's something to be said for perfectly executed modesty. What's wonderful is that despite the handful of mechanics, they all descend from one base mechanic--you can flip from ceiling to floor or vice versa but can't change directions during a flip. That's it.The crown jewel is an optional sequence called ""Veni, Vidi, Vici"" which is the one of the most challenging sequences I've played in a game in years and so so satisfying when you beat it. What's most poignant about the VVV sequence (and thus VVVVVV as a whole) is that the theme of being able to do these amazing space flips but not even make a little hop causes both thematic frustration--I can see that damn shiny trinket, why the hell can't I climb over this block and get there--and puzzle-related frustration. Wonderful.			"

												Amazing 8-bit platformer, I've spent countless hours playing it back in old days, then I decided to buy it on steam (you know that happens >____> ) to support the dev. So I don't have hours and achievements on steam:+OST: Amazing ost, have it in my Winamp playlist for a long time now :)+Visuals: Simple but nice pixelated graphics+Controls: Only 3 buttons controls < > and gravity change, pretty solid and trustable, which is important for a platformer game.+Gameplay: Game itself pretty interesting to beat, not too long, not too short, but the main problem is trophy room - you have in-game achievements as well as steam achievements, but they are so damn hard, it's like very close to impossible to get 100% of them.+Steam achievementsThis game is like 6 years old, so everyone who like platformers probably played it already but if you missed such a hit, don't hesitate and buy it, you won't be disappointed.

												This game, VVVVVV, it calls itself. A mess of letters that blend together into a mess of jagged lines, as if to trace one's path through life in a retrospective essay of Adobe Flash and Steam winter sales. It infuriates me. But not for the reasons one might expect, no, not the usual cries of difficulty and despair.I double-click the name in my Steam library and prepare for the worst. Forty nine cents, I say. This game cost me less than a round of slightly clogged arteries from the local fast food joint and was paid for entirely by selling virtual headwear and trading cards to those less fortunate than myself. Surely I will be able to find some modicum of enjoyment of this mess of Flash. Flash? Perhaps not! The forums of the Internet tell me that at one point it was remade in a proper programming language. As such, the game can suffer random slowdowns in fullscreen and neither the Steam overlay nor capture software such as Fraps will recognize the game. I found myself unable to take and upload screenshots of my trials in this pixelated, single-colored world, for all to see but none to comment on. A Google search leads to a Steam forum post regarding then-'soon' updates for overlays, achievements and the Cloud. The famous Cloud. This post dates from over two years ago. The Cloud has since been implemented to questionable effect, but now there are a host of colorful trinket achievements to chase. Did you already play the game to completion before their appearance? You're out of luck, buddy, do it again, they say. Alt-tabbing the game will lock your cursor in the corner of your screen and sometimes just crash. This game was not built on Source, they tell me. They're lying to me.The game itself controls acceptably. Sometimes I find myself sliding off platforms and into hazards and sometimes getting stuck inside either. Platformers should not have slippery controls like this, but the air control is precise and exact. Why is there such a difference? Is there an underlying message to be found here, perhaps describing the trials of Man trapped in his earthly plane? I would hope not, as this game predates the trend of waves upon waves of lazy, 'deep' indie ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t by several years. To the untrained eye it appears to fit quite well, though, with the simplistic graphics and chiptune soundtrack.This. This is where this executable of poor optimization and developer laziness gets to me. The game's art style is obviously meant to harken back to an era of dial-up and diskettes, in truth even earlier than both. Simple graphics and single color palettes attempt to imitate the limitations of old, yet miss the mark entirely. The developers want you to think you're playing a Commodore 64 game, down to including an imitation tape deck load screen upon startup, and yet they so clearly miss the appeal of the C64. Why go for plain, blocky graphics when it was capable of so much more? Why use a soundtrack consisting entirely of generic chiptunes churned out in Fruityloops in an afternoon when the Commodore was famous for its SID chip, used even today for its unique sound and characteristics? This was perhaps the biggest indicator of Vee Six's origins.Vee Six? Yes, that will do. I feel it fits this game nicely. You wanted the big American V8 with more displacement than the total Coke bottles in a shopping cart at Wal-Mart, but instead went for the more frugal six-cylinder for better gas mileage. Perhaps it shows up under a different name, like Grand Sport or Touring, but the illusion disappears as soon as the hood is opened and the guts of the machine become visible. Likewise, you wanted a game that harkens back to the days of incredible difficulty, but without actually playing a game from that era, so you bought Vee Six.It was quite ahead of its time, really, this poor little game. Perhaps it actually started the trend of retro-throwback games that only appear as such to the untrained, Mountain Dew chugging eye, taking a small break from his endless stacks of semi-futuristic first person shooters starring Sgt. Master Sgt. Technician of Operations Captain Slabmeat and his sidekicks, Alpha Team Bravo Charlie Omega. I have doubts about his ability to find such a game, though. This seems like one meant for that other audience, the one that cuddles into their woolen hat at the corner coffee house while typing on their ridiculously overpriced, shining white laptop and adjusting their lensless, thick-framed glasses. A game for those who want to go back... but not really, because they never experienced what they would be going back to in the first place. An imitation that falls apart like that disgusting hipster's Volkswagen as it gets driven around a small upstate city in New York looking for guys in skinny jeans and no shoes while struggling from no oil changes to no oil changes.So. An interesting word, 'so.' Both a statement and a question. So what? So this is a review, after all. Reviews have to have one final word, else the whole page might as well be used as a paper airplane to send your thoughts and dreams. In these modern times of instant messaging and ironic tendencies, no one has time to read more than exactly one hundred forty-four characters without requesting a short-form so their attention deficit disorder-afflicted minds can process that one tidbit of information before riding the rollercoaster of latest trends down the next incline while that child in the back row vomits all over himself and the poor sod sitting beside. Do I recommend this game? The question weighed heavily on my mind for days on end, pervading every waking moment with its incessant inquisition.Yes. I suppose I can recommend this game, if you enjoy throwing money at walls to throw a small, single-color, virtual person at a wall over and over. I move my mouse and hesitantly click the checkmark instead of the thumbs-down icon. Nobody reads negative reviews, after all, and unfortunately there is no option for 'indifference' or perhaps 'Yes, but only if on sale first.' I paid forty nine American pennies for a sadomasochism simulator in the guise of a 'retro' platformer game.I should have found two more quarters in my couch and bought a burger.			"

												Challenging platformer. Not very frustrating though. Although some sections (one in particular) made me spend lots of time to complete an objective, with countless deaths in the process. It has replayability, due to the achievements and play modes thrown in. The graphics are simplistic, but visually appealing, and the characters, although their only difference is color, have unique personalities. If you haven't already played VVVVVV, I suggest picking it up. It is a gameplay experience unlike any other.			"

Instead of jumping, you reverse gravity and fly towards the ceiling, or ""flip"". Flipping again brings you to the floor. It's got a free, easy to use level editor, many player levels already installed, different game modes, allows you to install new player levels, etc. 11/10 m8Also forgot to mention the music.

												Although the name of the game doesn't explain much about it, VVVVVV is a platforming game that will make you rip your hair out and make you scream loud enough to grow it back in. In VVVVVV you are able to manipulate your character to either gravitate downwards or upwards in the levels. While I ended getting so mad because of the difficulty of some of the levels in the game I couldn't stop playing and the game even supports custom levels with a built in level editor and has many different challenges after you complete the main story. If you love games like Super Meat Boy and other challenging platformers you should try VVVVVV!			"

This game is worth every penny you spend on it as it will give you hours of unique play time and a great challange.

-Quick Review-I'm still not really sure why it's called VVVVVV, I remember playing the game expecting the game to be chaotic, but it actually was a fairly entertaining game and interesting game. The game is a 2D exploration/adventure game that feels like something I would play on a classic GameBoy. -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  You are the captain of a ship and you have lost your crew mates! you need to go save them and get collect various artifacts of the strange world you're now stranded on. This game will give you various fun, enjoyable puzzles.At the time that I'm writing this review (08/20/14) I haven't completed the story, I stopped half way through, and then achievements were added so now I've boosted up when I want to complete and play this game. :DGame Play: I cannot say enough about simple controls. I love simple controls, jump, right, left, up, down. That's all you need.As I said earlier, the game plays like something you might play on a Classic GameBoy cartridge, I've never had a problem playing games which low graphics, it actually makes the game more fun and easier to play on mobile or smaller devices like laptops.The puzzles can sometimes be challenging but the game itself is very simple in nature and quite forgiving. As you progress or try to get special extra's the game challenges you more. I installed this game without expecting anything at all, and I was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying the game. (I've played 32 minutes worth of content before achievements were added) Achievements: At this time I haven't earned any of these achievements, but I had a glance and most of the achievements seem pretty straight forward. Beat the game, beat the game without dying X amount of times, do this interesting thing for X amount of time, Beat the game in X amount of time.The achievements look a bit last-luster and uninteresting but there really isn't much they can do with the game, and ultimately it's impressive that there are achievements at all for a 2D game with graphics this low.Price: VVVVVV is currently $4.99 That's a bit high of a price for a game if you don't plan to play it, I got the game for $1 on a 90% off sale in the steam 2013 Summer Sale. There is also a demo version of the game, which I would recommend trying out.Whenever there's a Demo you should try out the demo just to see if you actually like the content inside the game. It's good to read reviews for how a game plays, but testing out the graphics and game play for yourself is second too none. Conclusion: Most people are put off by the idea of playing a 2D game, especially one with very low graphics that looks like it was made for a very old game system, but I've always enjoyed games, both high quality, low quality, and in-between.I recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a short little game to play through that won't take up much memory, and has a few hours to burn. I also recommend it to anyone who already knows they don't mind low quality graphics in their video games.			"

												A challenging and stylish puzzle platformer.V's gameplay and design elevate it beyond another puzzle platformer. The game revolves around an intersting mechanic where the player can reverse the gravity of their character (Captain Viridian), causing him to flip between the floor and ceiling. Extremely clever level design makes using this mechanic fun, challenging, and rewarding. The minimalist style, both in art and narrative, manages to display a lot of character. Some of the dialogue suggests a bit of narrative, not enough to floor anyone, but it adds to making the game feel personal and whole. The art style also showcases the level design nicely, which is the highlight of the game. The soundtrack is icing on the cake.On top of the main mission of fighting your crew, you can also unlock extra bits of soundtrack by collecting ""shiny trinkets,"" which adds extra challenge and length to the game.Finishing a level in V is extremely satisfying; there is a definite, and fair challenge present. Brilliant level design, gameplay, and aesthetics make  V an excellent game.			"

												Another fun very basic platformer to play through. I particularly like the music, and the characters and story are cute.The game modes beyond the main storyline get ridiculously difficult, and are not really my thing. In particular, the achievements are ridiculously difficult, so I gave up on getting those. I would prefer a game with achievements that are more manageable i.e. things you can get if you put in maybe an hour of playtime for each achievement. To me they get too repetitive and frustrating.

												Even though I loved Super Hexagon so much, I was wary of VVVVVV a little bit, just because of the reputation of it being kind of difficult. I'm not very good at platformers, and I often get annoyed with them. But, even though I died over 1600 times finishing this game, each death only filled me with hope and determination. Every time I pressed the wrong button and ran into spikes, or didn't press any button and ran into spikes, or fell onto spikes, or jumped into spikes for no reason, or any of the other 1600 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed things I did, I just felt more resolve to finish this game. Even the 400 deaths on Veni Vidi Vici just made made me want to get it even more after each try.The graphics are gorgeous, the music absolutely perfect, and even though it's a small thing, the room names were a standout. Sometimes encouraging, sometimes ironic, sometimes scathing, it was like having a biting narrator quip over your shoulder while pretending they weren't really interested in what you're doing. This is a triumph for Terry Cavanagh. I'm proud of myself for finishing this game. I'll be even prouder when I 100% it (hah!).			"

												After a mere 2 hours on the game, I have already found it extremely enjoyable. This 2D game gives the ""easy to play"" look, but when you begin to explore the properties of VVVVVV, you'll find there are many extremely difficult challenges waiting. I find the old arcade look wonderful, and the soundtrack is very talented as well. I would definitely recommend VVVVVV to a gamer looking for a challenge!			"

												If you had told me before VVVVVV that a difficult platformer with a simple concept that is based around precision-timing jumps would not only not give me a burning desire to throw the controller at the screen in frustration, but that I would actually have a hard time letting go of said controller for almost the whole duration of the game, you probably would've gotten a face full of sarcastic laughter (which sounds eerily like the Super Meat Boy tune). Or, more likely, I would've ignored your suggestion until I got the game half-free as part of a Humble Bundle (sorry, brother, your suggestions are the best!) and had no excuse not to play this highly-praised game. I enjoy quality platforming as much as most gamers and don't mind the difficulty that typically comes with such games, especially when they are indie-made. But I need to be in a very specific mindset if I am to endure countless re-attempts at the slightest mistake and I run out of that energy eventually regardless of how far I got in the game. VVVVVV rectifies the image of indie platformers you have in your head with a surprising breath of clarity - even the confusing name makes perfect sense after staring at those same spikes room after room. Instead of jumping, you switch gravity back and forth so that you're either standing on ground or on the ceiling - and that's all there is to it. No upgrades, no weapons, everything you come across is doable from the get-go. The world is open, reminiscent of Metroidvania games, but even with a minimal plot and the ability to choose your own path, playng is straight-forward and you never feel lost.What could've been only a gimmick or proof-of-concept-gameplay comes together as a tight, addictive package, thanks to the gratituous use of checkpoints. There is typically at least one in each room and as you die you reappear next to it without further hassle, so once you figure out how to gravity-change yourself out of the next pickle or ace the pixel-tight patterns of moving obstacles, you're safe again.  Dying constantly is not only allowed, it's celebrated, with the total number of deaths in your current playthrough proudly displayed in the menu. There are Steam achievements for finishing the game with a small number of deaths, but you don't have to care about that unless you really want to. You can collect trinkets in the game, which unlocks some extras, and there are a few which can test your patience, but thanks to the checkpoints, you don't have to memorize minutes of tough manouvers; it's all finely chopped down.Of course, the platforming in this game is still challenging - if you didn't enjoy the joys of precision jumping in a game like the original Super Mario Brothers, you probably won't enjoy this. But the game isn't needlessly or falsely difficult. VVVVVV presents itself as exactly as it is, trial-and-error gameplay in the word's most positive sense. You can focus on the platforming puzzles without being punished for dying while trying to get a ""feel"" of each room's pattern. Each new checkpoint reached feels like a little win and you get through even the more difficult parts with the knowledge that the gameplay is logical and rewards your patient learning, not luck.Of course, the game also has a great soundtrack and little details like the amusing dialogue and room names. My biggest grief is with the Steam Achievements; they should be more varied. Finishing with less and less deaths makes sense as a challenge, as do the flip mode and no-death mode achievements, but the many Super Gravitron and perfect Time Trial achievements seem pointless and don't motivate to play more.

												Basic platformer indies have invaded gaming like a virus constantly multiplying which makes it hard to find a worthwhile one. VVVVVV is deserving of your time. Cheery chip tunes and cute smiling characters set the upbeat tone. As long as you can appreciate the minimalistic art design enough to stomach the potentially seizure inducing flares of bright colors on-screen, there is interesting platforming to be explored here. Platforming difficulty ranges from gleefully intriguing to seemingly impossible, though it should be mentioned the hardest sections are optional. I found this game on a mega sale for less than $1 and I would have paid full price, I thoroughly enjoyed completing it.Funny Let's Play Vid I made of the hardest platforming section in the game

												#Beat on VITA - 2 hoursVVVVVV is a platformer whose main idea is you are a captain of a ship and you are off to rescue your crew. The levels in the game are based around the fact you can switch gravity (so you can walk on the ceiling).   So the main difficulty (and it does get difficult) is doing this quickly and avoiding being hit by things. Overall, a fun (but very) short platformer. There is replay value in time attacks, collectables, and another mode.			"

												This game was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. The simple graphics and control scheme fool you into thinking this is just going to be a straightforward platformer with levels like a cell phone game. There is a large open-world map that leads to individual stages where you rescue crewmembers to finish the game. Some areas can be frustrating but I got through the main game without too much trouble. There are plenty of challenging achievements beyond that.			"

												Are you a fellow Metroid fan suffering the drought of Nintendo's midlife crisis? Well. then buy this game immediately. The sense of exploration gives off the vibes of the first four Metroid games, while still feeling fresh and creative. The gravity reverse mechanic may sound like a lazy gimmick, but actually is put to great use throughout the game. It's a bit challenging, but it almost never feels unforgiving or unfair. It's also really cheap. It's only a fraction of the price of buying your average retail game, so it's worth every penny. Well, granted, the game was gifted to me, but that's besides the point.

												Ah, VVVVVV. I got this as part of a pack of games during the 2010 steam holiday sale. I don't even know what else was in the package. Five dollars for this game, by itself, is a fricken bargain. The graphics are aggressively retro, bringing you back to your DOS days of command prompts and computers with no harddrive(er, if you're old, like me). The soundtrack is sublime. The controls are deliberately floaty and imprecise; Like with Super Meat boy, this is a game where you need to learn restraint in order to achieve precision, a game where you're constantly sliding after landing and flying further than you intended. Every action has inertial consequences. But unlike super meat boy, it's less reactive, its inertial force harder to fight, and thus more consistent and predictable yet no less difficult. Where the slightest backtap could mean spikey death in SMB, which makes Meatboy feel weightless and heavy at the same time, VVVVVV feels consistently heavy but low-gravity, and therein lies its brilliance.Fantastic. Just really good.PS: I played this to completion before they added achievements; I don't know how complete I'd have gotten it but I do know I finished the game with all the shiny trinkets(though, it must be said, dying hundreds of times along the way).

												Indeed not a long game but it's not a short game either, a lot can be taken from the experience and alot can be explored in the game by collecting collectables, etc... Storywise it's straightforward, save your friends by going through puzzles and exploring, a normal story line which can lead to a few twists while saving a few of them. The soundtrack is something I found dear about this game, going through level by level, dying over and over with the soundtrack keeping me in high spirits and makes me want to keep playing, the whole puzzle and ""press space to invert gravity"" is a nice touch and can lead to some challenging puzzles which can take effort to get through but is worth to say the least but there is one part that stands out the most challenging and that is ""Veni Vidi Vici"" which in order to get a collectable you have to go though this insanely difficult challenge which I could not do so I had to leave it, the ending is something to look forward to with the game ending with the last legit level called ""VVVVVV"" which gave me the chills, I do recommend the game to anyonle who enjoys puzzle games with a challenging aspects to them, in my belief I'd like to say this game is a masterpeice and just by looking at the title you'd thing some kid just held down the V key with Caps Lock on but really it can have more meanings than that like the 5 characters names all starting with V, etc... but back to the point, this game is an interesting take on puzzle/indie games and would hope more games like these would rise.

It can be infintely frustrating, especially for a ompletionist who wants to find all 20 of the shiny trinkets, but finally getting through the tower or executing a correct jump around a slingshot bend after 20+ deaths comes with an incredible sense of accomplishment. My friend and I recorded a let's play of VVVVVV for our youtube channel, and it was both fun and arduous. I died over 1500 times in my first run of the game, and we ran a death counter to prove it. But I had fun. And after 2.5 hours of play, I walked away from the computer able to say that I beat ""that infernal platformer"". With that said, it is not the most murdurous of the platformers, and it can help ease people into themore homicidal games (Super Meat Boy). I highly recommend it. The title is also fun.			"

												PPPPPP (the soundtrack for this game) is one of the best game soundtracks of any game I've played.  The simplicity and yet difficulty make this game perfect for speedrunning, and even creating custom maps for it.  The main map/story for the game, however does not take very long to complete.  Although, I have played through the game many times!			"

												Sure the thing is hard, but if you are an aveRAGE player you can beat it in around two hours. It also offers a lot of replayibility, with custom levels, challenges and everything.If you are ok with platformers, this game is definitely worth the low price.If you are a speedrunner, you beat the game a couple hundred times and you are reading the reviews just for fun.

												VVVVVV is a fantastic puzzle/adventure game with a unique style of gameplay and brilliantly designed levels for newbies and experts alike. Your ship has crashed and you are now in an alternate world! The only problem now is that you have lost all of your shipmates. Embark on a gravity changing journey as you move from the floor, to the ceiling and back, and find your friends. This game is one of a kind and should only take you a few hours to complete. VVVVVV is definitely worth the time; it includes dungeon-esque levels with many hidden secrets and a large world full of puzzles that you use gravity to solve. If you are looking for a unique and overlooked gem, consider buying this game today.			"

												A perfect game, on all compartments.Want to play for the story? Then hop on a journey to rescue your crew-mates who got lost in space, the game is extremely fun and with a ""normal"" difficulty degree if you don't go for trophies.Want more challenge? Then challenge the game and try to get all the discs to unlock more hardcore content.Mad enough? Then get to play one of the most balanced, fair, and difficult arcade platformers ever made (yes there are speedrunners too).Everything I wrote above seasoned with an intense mixture of 8-bit music and graphics that are just perfect, nothing more to add.If you're unsure you may like the game or not (if you don't then probably you don't understand what's good and bad and you don't deserve this game) you can try the first two levels on kongregate, somewhere.Anyway I recommend this game to everyone, even just to understand when you can really say that a game is GOOD and not just fancy or cool like most games nowadays.

												I hate indie, but Very Fun Game! The retro-esque gravity defying platformer VVVVVV takes one back to the days of better gaming -- where skill actually matters because the reward is worth it. You'll find the game-play difficult but not overly so and the payoff of finding new areas or making an ""impossible"" maneuver worthwhile. The music gives me goosebumps and fits in quite well with the game -- that of exploring space in an strange and unknown dimension to find your crew-mates. Precision platforming -- retro style -- at its best! 10/10.			"

												VVVVVV takes a retro approach with its aesthetics. And while this no-nonsense style can be appealing in its own way, what really hooks you when you play this game is its consistently creative level design and its devious challenge. It's fun to explore VVVVVV's open world and tackle its levels in any order.

There's lots of checkpoints in the game so you shouldn't get stuck for too long, however.I don't think the game is as hard as a lot of people make it out to be, though - I personally think Super Meat Boy and Mighty Jill Off are harder indie platformers, but 100%ing this game would be a nightmare, especially with the no death run.

You can also collect Shiny Trinkets, which if you get all 20 of, you get access to the Secret Lab and the Super Gravitron.It's very open ended, because after the first level, you can do the rest of the game in any order you like. There's also a gigantic overworld to explore for you adventurer people.And it's cool.11/10.tldr: Just buy it. It's cool.			"

If you have any solutions to this problem PLEASE CONTACT ME. I have all the buttons activated and its juat a super annoying situation. Enough of me nit picking... The soundtrack on this game is in my opinion the best I've heard. I like the fact that you can collect more songs as the game rolls on, this way youre not getting bored with the same repetitive background audio. I love the concept of gravity switching it really sets the game aside from other platformers. The storyline is just the bonus to the amazing gameplay.			"

												VVVVVV is a masterpiece and one of the best platformers I've ever played, there are many acheivements and game modes / trials to keep you coming back to play more and more after you have completed the game itself and have gotten the tunes stuck in your head from the brilliant soundtrack that comes with it. There are lots of areas to discover and things to collect, there are also in-game ""Trophies"" to acquire too if you're feeling up to a tough challenge.This game is brilliant for so many different reasons, one of the main reasons is because It has the ability to create a great atmosphere while using extremely simple graphics, said graphics are also one of the primary things that gives this game it's charm.While it's a difficult game (but by no means impossible), it has a nice frequent checkpoint system that keeps you from losing too much progress at one given time, as it is likely that you will die a LOT on your first run. People who have posted negative reviews of this game by saying ""It's too hard"" are most likely just bad at it. The game is hard, yes, but it's not hard to the point where it takes hours to get through a certain area. The balance is just right, in my opinion.Overall, a great game with a great soundtrack. Definitely add this one to your collection, whether it's on sale or not! I'm really glad I picked this up in the sale and took the time to try it. You won't regret it.			"

												VVVVVV takes a simple mechanic (flipping gravity) and explores it to its fullest potential. Between the wonderful music, creative levels, and charming retro art style (more in homage to the C64 than the NES) your first playthrough will be a joy from beginning to end. And if you put down the game there, the experience would be worthwhile.But the game's real challenge comes from trying to beat the game with the fewest number of deaths. On a casual run, deaths have no real impact, aside from taking you back to your last checkpoint, of which there are plenty. But once you know the layout of the game, the focus changes from exploration to mastery. Personally, I am not one to care about time trials or speedrunning, or any arbitrary reason to replay the same game over and over again, but VVVVVV is a rare exception to that; the gameplay and level design is just so tight, that each playthrough feels as fresh as the last. And the game length is just perfect for the occasional replay to try and improve your death count.I think this game has something to offer all fans of retro platformers, whether that's exploring the simple world and finding its secrets, trying to collect all of the optional (and often frustratingly hard) trinkets, or replaying the game to improve upon your best score.

												This is a ridiculously entertaining game once you get a hang of the chief mechanic: Instead of jumping, you reverse gravity. There are myriad applications of this practice, and while it may take some time to comprehend, you'll soon be pulling off anti-gravity parkour techniques and surviving. Not to mention that this game has an adorable cast of V's that are all willing to help you learn the secrets of Dimension VVVVVV...provided that you help them find each other first. There's puzzles that will test your wits, willpower, endurance, and creativity, and special collectibles that will dare you to take things one step further, with rewards waiting for you in return for that hard work.And if you get this game, don't skip out on the soundtrack. This game's music is delightfully catchy, and soon you'll flip every time you hear it.			"

												This is a hesitant recommendation. I liked the game a lot at first, but as I play more it feels like bundle fodder more than a solid game. It's short and focused on replaying for completion, but the game doesn't seem to change much in replaying. The only real reason to replay is to seek out all the achievements, but that will be an agonizing process of precision and deaths.I like how it focuses on one mechanic, flipping gravity, and plays with it in many good ways. However, that makes platforming a bit rough. Since ""jumps"" are based on left/right motion and timing of flips, I think the devs intentionally made left/right motion INCREDIBLY slipppery. See, you slide on every surface like you are a dog♥♥♥♥♥♥icicle, accelerating like a madman and never able to take a small step. Platforming becomes very unforgiving with smaller windows of mistakes. It IS satisfying when you complete some sections quickly, but most likely you will feel aggravated relief after you finally complete a painful section. The ""Do as I say, Not as I do"" section will show you how bad the sliding can be.I like the concept and style, but the execution makes it difficult to enjoy. However, it could be far worse. The short length and open paths means you can complete sections as you please (for the most part) and see the core of the game to completion with some patience. Eversion is even shorter but far more frustrating. And Yet It Moves takes the flipping idea, applies it to 4 directions, adds enemies and awkward physics, and kills you if you fall too far. AYIM is one of the games I hate the most.So, it's interesting, and done better than most. Still frustrating and handles awkwardly with the acceleration, but I hesitantly recommend if you are a platforming fan wanting something new to replay for time trials.			"

												Great 2D platformer where instead of jumping you can switch gravity. The controls are not very smooth but everything else is great. While not very long (~4h), I managed to die 1126 times (I'm a huge n00b) but it was not a problem as waypoints were very frequent and in all the right spots, and with instant loading times. Even though I googled the solution to one of the puzzles much to my shame, the puzzles are very fun. Did I mention the soundtrack? No? Well, it's awesome (if you like chiptune)!

												Wow is this game hard. The character dialog is surprisingly well written for a incredibly retro style game – The ships crew are all friends and are not identical or two-dimensional as their graphics make them. The interesting plot, characters and incredibly-difficult-but-surmountable gameplay along with an excellent soundtrack all make VVVVVV worthy of your time.			"

												From the outside, VVVVVV may just look like another retro-styled game that uses its retro factor to hide the fact that it's just another generic platformer. While the former may be true, this is definitely not your average platformer.The story of this game is simple: you're a captain of a spaceship and your crew has been scattered through another dimension due to some interference. You need to find them and stop the interference. The graphic style is heavily inspired by the Commodore 64's graphics, while the sountrack is more reminiscent of that of the NES. Both of these work great together, although they might not be amusing for someone is tired of retro styled indie games.VVVVVV is a metroidvania game: meaning that you can explore the dimension you're in looking for all sorts of things (crew members, trinkets, teleporters). What makes VVVVVV so special however is that you can't jump, but you can flip gravity so that you'll go up instead of down, and vice-versa. The concept is easy to learn (but incredibly hard to master), and leads to many creative levels. There will be some levels *cough*Doing Things The Hard Way*cough* that will usually frustrate the crap out of you, but at the same time you'll have a blast trying to figure out how to get through them (unless you are very easily frustrated, in which case, you should stay away from this game). On top of the main game, there are tons of other features that will keep you playing for hours, such as collecting all of the trinkets, time trials, various game modes (flip mode where the entire game is flipped upside down and no death mode where if you die once you have to restart the game), and even a level creator.VVVVVV will make you want to break your keyboard and you will love every minute of it. What makes this game even better is that it's often on sale for a low price (sometimes even $0.49!). This is a must have for those looking for a challenge.			"

												VVVVVV is a masterpiece and one of the best platformers I've ever played, there are many acheivements and game modes / trials to keep you coming back to play more and more after you have completed the game itself and have gotten the tunes stuck in your head from the brilliant soundtrack that comes with it. There are lots of areas to discover and things to collect, there are also in-game ""Trophies"" to acquire too if you're feeling up to a tough challenge.This game is brilliant for so many different reasons, one of the main reasons is because It has the ability to create a great atmosphere while using extremely simple graphics, said graphics are also one of the primary things that gives this game it's charm.While it's a difficult game (but by no means impossible), it has a nice frequent checkpoint system that keeps you from losing too much progress at one given time, as it is likely that you will die a LOT on your first run. People who have posted negative reviews of this game by saying ""It's too hard"" are most likely just bad at it. The game is hard, yes, but it's not hard to the point where it takes hours to get through a certain area. The balance is just right, in my opinion.Overall, a great game with a great soundtrack. Definitely add this one to your collection, whether it's on sale or not! I'm really glad I picked this up in the sale and took the time to try it. You won't regret it.			"

												VVVVVV takes a simple mechanic (flipping gravity) and explores it to its fullest potential. Between the wonderful music, creative levels, and charming retro art style (more in homage to the C64 than the NES) your first playthrough will be a joy from beginning to end. And if you put down the game there, the experience would be worthwhile.But the game's real challenge comes from trying to beat the game with the fewest number of deaths. On a casual run, deaths have no real impact, aside from taking you back to your last checkpoint, of which there are plenty. But once you know the layout of the game, the focus changes from exploration to mastery. Personally, I am not one to care about time trials or speedrunning, or any arbitrary reason to replay the same game over and over again, but VVVVVV is a rare exception to that; the gameplay and level design is just so tight, that each playthrough feels as fresh as the last. And the game length is just perfect for the occasional replay to try and improve your death count.I think this game has something to offer all fans of retro platformers, whether that's exploring the simple world and finding its secrets, trying to collect all of the optional (and often frustratingly hard) trinkets, or replaying the game to improve upon your best score.

												There are really two types of people in this world. Those who hate maddeningly frustrating twitch platformers like this one, and those who hate maddeningly frustrating twitch platformers like this one so much, they can't stop playing them. Spiritual elder sibling to ""You Have To Win The Game,"" VVVVVV is to the Commodore 64 platformer of yore what its CGA cousin is to the DOS platformer of yore, and I cannot possibly recommend both games enough. To paraphrase the words that prefaced the Dungeons and Dragons rulebook so many years ago, those gamers who lack patience, those who don't care for Monty Mole's adventures through sprawling maps of tricky-to-navigate rooms, who feel no thrill upon waking up with Lester in the suspended cage in that famously Another World, who do not enjoy rubbing their palmheel raw on the molded plastic grip of an old one-button joystick with a nine-pin connector or trying hundreds of times to see what lies beyond that maddening gauntlet of hazards, even if it's just a blank room that hasn't been visited before, will not be likely to find VVVVVV to their tastes. But those whose curiosity knows no bounds and whose frustration tolerance rivals that of a Zen master will find this game the answer to their SID-soundtracked, load-star-comma-eight-comma-one prayers. The very simple graphics may put you off; don't let them. The six Vs of the title, the cast of the game, take a little getting-used-to, certainly, and I admit, I would have liked a slightly less stylized (if still period-appropriate) character model, but their simple Carcassone-like iconic cuteness grows on you, or at least a tolerance to it accumulates. The characters have two recognizable facial expressions, and their paddle-like, boxy heads are sized, I suspect, to accommodate those easily-recognizable expression changes. Without sharing spoilers, I should note that it becomes clear, later in the game, that their box-headed design was thematically intentional. If you don't like it, relax, and don't let that stop you from enjoying this amazing game.The backgrounds, with their stylized metal plating, single-color enemies, and two-plane-deep parallax scrolling gamefield, will be immediately recognizable to C64 fans, as will the bombastic, cheerful, strident soundtrack of in-game looped hits by Magnus Pålsson. While You Have To Win The Game offers only monophonic sound cues, in line with its pre-soundcard DOS-and-PC-speaker pedigree, VVVVVV feels much less stark and empty for its consistently cheerful, upbeat and hopeful tone, and the soundtrack plays a huge role in creating that atmosphere of ""Let's play space explorers!"" Saturday morning excitement. Again, like its cousin, the massive, sprawling map is liberally dotted with continue points, which make recovering from one of the game's many nigh-inevitable deaths less painful, as little ground must be regained afterward. Like its cousin, exploration is key, and will be rewarded -- the map view offers a tantalizing glimpse of area not yet traveled, and the desire to wipe away all the blank areas on it is strong. Like its cousin, the game's locales can be revisited after winning, explored anew, and there's a reward in store for completionists. Like its cousin, spikes are an ever-present and vexing environmental hazard. Like its cousin, there are a few graphic options that help to recreate a much more obviously retro gaming platform experience. (I love Analogue Mode, though I wish there was a way to reduce the frequency of vertical hold failures, or to turn off vertical hold failures completely.) So, you might be asking, how does VVVVVV differ from You Have To Win The Game? Quite significantly, despite their many similarities. First, the bombastic, upbeat optimism of the game is a stark contrast to YHTWTG's quiet and emptiness. There are no friends to be found in YHTWTG, while in VVVVVV, reuniting the titular Vs is, in fact, the primary goal of the game's main arc. (This is not a spoiler, for not; it's stated from the get-go.) Furthermore, while YHTWTG uses a fairly conventional run-and-jump platformer mechanic, there is no jump button in VVVVVV. Rather, the protagonist can reverse personal gravity, and elect to ""fall up"" rather than down, more or less at will.More or less, indeed. To flip gravity, one must first be standing on (at least momentarily) solid ground. A flip in progress must complete, and land successfully, before the player can flip again. Our brave Captain Viridian can steer mid-fall, but can't stop a fall. It is entirely possible to end up missing a safe landing point this way. Be grateful for those ubiquitous continue-points. You'll need them. At least, mercifully, one can't die from too long a fall.I've already mentioned the difference in mood, but beyond this, VVVVVV is communicative in a way YHTWTG isn't. The landscape is dotted with computer terminals hosting messages, and of course, there are five crew members to find and rescue. While YHTWTG offers no clues about its landscape, VVVVVV tells a coherent narrative, and while many questions are left unanswered, one leaves VVVVVV with a better sense of the events of the game in a narrative context than the state in which one leaves YHTWTG.VVVVVV offers some really spectacular accessibility features for gamers who would normally not be able to play this sort of game, too. One can slow down the game incrementally, turn off moving backgrounds and screen effects, or set the protagonist invincible. The granularity of slowdown control allows you to easily notch the game's reflexes-related difficulty back to a point where it's still challenging but playable, for those who can't react quickly enough at full game speed. This option, as opposed to simply implementing the invulnerability switch, shows a real solid understanding of not only what such a player might need, but how to provide it while preserving as much of the challenge of the game as said player wishes to face. It's rare that this much thought goes into accessibility accommodations, let alone in an indie game. Finally, VVVVVV offers tools to build one's own levels and scenarios, to bundle them up, and to share them with others. There are quite a few fan-made levels out there, and they're often quite impressive. Terry Cavanagh offers a free ""Make and Play"" edition of VVVVVV that creates and plays fan-made levels, allowing you to easily and legally share what you make with others. That feature alone extends VVVVVV far beyond the scope of YHTWTG, and makes it a real must-have at its $5 price point. (Frankly, it was more than worth its original $15 price point, too, but I'm glad the price dropped, and VVVVVV became a much more comfortable impulse buy for the still-unconvinced gamer.)VVVVVV will frustrate you. It will vex you. It will make you scream in frustration and insist it's 'impossible' at least once or twice, but then you'll sail past a difficult level and the palpable joy of your triumph will eclipse the frustration. (Veni Vidi Vici, anyone...?) If your frustration tolerance is limited, this is probably not the game for you. If you can't get beyond the lo-fi visual style, if ""chiptunes"" annoy you, if dying over and over again bothers you, and especially if you're not not a twitch-reflexes run-and-jumper (run-and-flipper?), then this is probably not your game.You're probably either put off or curious now. I hope you're curious. VVVVVV rewards curiosity, as long as it's tempered with a healthy dose of patience. Jump in, flip gravity, and rock out the soundtrack. This is a fun, sunny, bombastic return to Saturday mornings on the Commodore 64, in all the very best of ways.			"

												To hear the full review, listen to the episode on Game Hoard Podcast[soundcloud.com]VVVVVV is a great little platformer built around a single unique mechanic: instead of jumping, you have the ability to switch gravity up and down. This mechanic leads to some of the most inventive and challenging platforming gameplay I've ever encountered. Every single room becomes a platforming puzzle as you try to figure out how to use gravity to move through hostile environments without dying, which you will do often. Luckily, the game wastes no time respawning you at the nearest checkpoint, which are liberally sprinkled throughout the environment. VVVVVV also thankfully leaves lives and game overs out of the equation. The result is a game with a high challenge but that never feels punishing or impossible and moves forward at lightning speed.Also welcome is the open world game design that makes VVVVVV feel Metroidvania-esque. Different areas of the map have different sorts of obstacles and challenges, allowing you to explore and progress at your own pace.Another interesting aspect is the game's story, which does not feature a villain or enemies of any kind. The story feels like a small side quest happening in a larger world, which is a refreshing change from a typical platformer where you need to save the world/princess.It also has one of the best chiptune tracks that you will ever hear and features simple but effective graphics inspired by C64 games.Overall, VVVVVV is an immensely satisfying experience for anyone up to the challenge and I highly recommend it.

												In case you somehow haven't heard of this game by 2017, it's great. The game is very simple, with the only mechanics on your character being moving left and right, as well as reversing gravity. Rather than tacking on endless amounts of abilities, which can be fun, this game instead introduces a level-specfic gimmick, gets your comfortable with it, and demands perfection. This game can be tough, REALLY tough. But even when it's tough it so ingenius that you want to pull on. There are frequent checkpoints too in case you screw up often, as well as collectables for those who want to go the extra mile. Once you get bored of the regular campaign, there's also time trial mode for the specific levels, a flip mode where everything is upside down (which messes with you on a psychological level more than anything), and a level editor. From what I've seen so far the community isn't huge for this game anymore, but levels built into the browser can be fun, and making your own can be great as well. Overall I very much reccomend this game, so long as your aren't feint of heart.			"

The game's layout is in the same style as Metroid, as the map is huge and it's easy to get lost. You basically move around while defying and re-defying gravity to navigate through levels. Checkpoints are scattered everywhere and your going to need them from all of the times you die. There are 20 trinkets to find in order to unlock the jukebox or something as the music in this game is epic with its catchy tunes. Graphics are simple classic 8-bit style with bizarre looking enemies, almost feels like something out of a Commodore 64 or ZX Spectrum game. If there's one thing this game is known for, it's challenge, there is a lot of tricks and puzzles in navigating through the place and you really have to be quick on your feet and plan ahead on what to do. Overall VVVVVV is a great challenging game that feels like a throw back to the old PC games.			"

												VVVVVV may be one of the most clever, creative, challenging, and just plain fun platformers I've ever played. If you don't like the graphics, you'll like the gameplay. If you don't like the gameplay, you'll like the dialogue. If you don't like the dialogue, you'll like the soundtrack. If you don't like the soundtrack, either turn the volume down a bit or get your ears checked, because it is absolutely fantastic. This quickly became one of my favorite games. Throw away your doubts.

												VVVVVV is one of the best platformers available on Steam. It has a simple yet brilliant concept to base an entire platformer around. I love the difficulty of this game, it's very balanced. Not too frustratingly hard, but it's certainly not easy. All of the levels in this game are interesting. I can't say it simpler than that. I love every bit of the gameplay this game has to offer.			"

												It's a game with a fun concept in spite of having some really cheap level design at points. There are a lot of points in the game where I was rather angry at the level design, though. It, more than anything else, was really unfair and occasionally expected you to be incredibly precise. But it still had a fun, creative mechanic.			"

												This is a hesitant recommendation. I liked the game a lot at first, but as I play more it feels like bundle fodder more than a solid game. It's short and focused on replaying for completion, but the game doesn't seem to change much in replaying. The only real reason to replay is to seek out all the achievements, but that will be an agonizing process of precision and deaths.I like how it focuses on one mechanic, flipping gravity, and plays with it in many good ways. However, that makes platforming a bit rough. Since ""jumps"" are based on left/right motion and timing of flips, I think the devs intentionally made left/right motion INCREDIBLY slipppery. See, you slide on every surface like you are a dog♥♥♥♥♥♥icicle, accelerating like a madman and never able to take a small step. Platforming becomes very unforgiving with smaller windows of mistakes. It IS satisfying when you complete some sections quickly, but most likely you will feel aggravated relief after you finally complete a painful section. The ""Do as I say, Not as I do"" section will show you how bad the sliding can be.I like the concept and style, but the execution makes it difficult to enjoy. However, it could be far worse. The short length and open paths means you can complete sections as you please (for the most part) and see the core of the game to completion with some patience. Eversion is even shorter but far more frustrating. And Yet It Moves takes the flipping idea, applies it to 4 directions, adds enemies and awkward physics, and kills you if you fall too far. AYIM is one of the games I hate the most.So, it's interesting, and done better than most. Still frustrating and handles awkwardly with the acceleration, but I hesitantly recommend if you are a platforming fan wanting something new to replay for time trials.			"

You'll find the game-play difficult but not overly so and the payoff of finding new areas or making an ""impossible"" maneuver worthwhile. The music gives me goosebumps and fits in quite well with the game that of exploring space in an strange and unknown dimension to find your crew-mates. Precision platforming -retro style at its best!

												VVVVVV ( 6 V's) is a short platforming game which the only thing u can do is move and walk either on the ground or on the ceiling!? The dynamics in this game looks like it was made on an NES but is actually on multiple consoles like Wii, PS3,Xbox, and PC but are in their own digital shops.You play as Viridian, a captain of his ship that was crashed in a mysterious universe called Dimension V. All of the members of the ship are teleported to diffrent areas or the dimension. You must search the entire dimension for ur lost members with ur abilty to go up or down. The achivements in this game are really hard to get especially beating no death mode since your always going to have at least 50 deaths. While ur exploring the dimension, u will encounter trinkets which dont do anything until u find 20 of them but i wont spoil it for u. Every room is quite puzzling and u might do some backtracking which is every gamers nightmare (im talking to u Metroid). This game gets 8 out of 10 because the game is really short and u can probably beat the game in less than 3 hours depending how good u are.			"

												Great game - good enough to prompt me to write my first review. Pretty short to just complete, but it's a few hours packed with fun ideas that don't overstay their welcome. For those who want to get everything, there are some real nasty challenges to overcome, and also a lot of good additional levels that can be downloaded too. Highly recommended.			"

												You're actually going to buy this, right? Are you also one of those people who bought Super Meat Boy for the sake of seeing how annoyed you could get in under a minute? Yeah, me too. You'll probably like this in that case. Just put away all the nice things you own before you look for things to take your anger out on.			"

												I really like this game!  It reminds me of the old games I used to play as a kid on the Commoder 64 or the Vic20.  Old music, old graphics, but a new concept.  The puzzles are challenging and the story line is interesting.  My only issue with the game is that you cannot save your progress from one day to the next.  It is a lot of fun to play, though, and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone! "

												A very simple but challenging game. While the whole game may be based on one major machanic (changing gravity), the strategy required to beat each level is varied enough to avoid a feeling of repitition. The graphics are miminal and serve their purpose, but the music is upbeat and interesting enough to avoid being repetitive. Although you will die a multitude of times because of the game's difficulty, the lack of punishment for dying makes it fun to keep trying and trying, and provides a feeling of success when you finally beat a stage.

												I first bought 'Super Hexagon' and because I liked the basics of that game I also got this little game here (and it was on sale for 50ct...). VVVVVVIt took a while to get the background of the name. Six 'V' ? Why? But I think it is judt because in the game you have to rescue your crew after you spaceship crashed and everyone was sprayed over the map. It's an simple 2D jump and run game or no, that's wrong. It is not just a jump and run game and it is defenetly not simple. The mechanics are simple, you have a character (the captain) and you can move (left and right arrowkey) and reverse the gravety (spyce or one of the other arrows). That's it. There is a world you have to explore and you have to find the rest of the crew. Back to the name :) all crew member names are starting with a 'V' all together (you + five you have to find) six 'V's. If there is an other explenation for the Name, please let me know.The game has it's own charm. The simple grafics, the oldschool music (which is really good) and the simple gameplay are fitting together very well. And death are not bad. They are normal in this game. During the 2h campain you will die a couple of times ( I reached over 1000 times, a friend over 1500 times), so don't be frustrated if you don't get one of the extra points, just move on. And if you have really problems, you can turn down the gamespeed so you have more time to react, nice idea to do it this way, so everyone can go on without leaving anything.I would not buy it for the normal 5$, but if you see it on sale...get it! ;) "

												I don't usually play 'super ultra hardmodo so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ difficult that you die IRL from playing it' sort of games, but this was on sale, and so for whatever reason I thought I would give it a try. And everything worked out better than expected.VVVVVV understands an important thing that a lot of games seem to not: The difference between difficult and frustrating. And it is the former. While the puzzles and actiony bits are indeed quite hard, you have infinite lives and checkpoints are scattered everywhere, and this is actually a very good thing as it encourages you to keep trying and get better at it rather than encouraging you to quit and uninstall the game. There's also a lot to explore which 1) means you can go and try some other level if you're stuck on one, and 2) means there's enough to keep you going for a while. As of writing I haven't even finished this game (normally I wait until I've either completed a game or uninstalled it out of rage before writing a positive or negative review respectively).The story's nothing special and just serves as what is known in some communities as an ""Excuse Plot"", which is perfectly fine as it doesn't pretend it does have a good story and you can just ignore it. The characters are all generally likeable though, which is of course better than the alternative. As for the soundtrack, it again pleasantly surprised me as I don't usually like chiptunes but this OST somehow stands out. Pretty much none of them are tracks that I would bother turning the music off for. It's worthwhile picking up the soundtrack for general listening purposes. One negative I will say about this game though is the lack of native gamepad support so you need Xpadder or Joy2Key or what have you in order to fully enjoy it. Perhaps I'm just weird and most people can play this with a keyboard just fine, but I don't.			"

												VVVVVV is a great platformer and puzzle game with difficult levels that make you want to try over and over again. This is in no way a bad game. The classic retro style may not have the best graphics but that doesn't change anything. The music and tough level design fit well together and the story is small but awesome. You basically are Captain Viridian in some strange place after your ship crashed and need to explore and find the rest of your crew. I highly recommend this to fans of platformers, puzzle and retro style games. If you want to get into platformers this might be a challenge for you so try something easier like Mario or Kirby then maybe move on to games like this or Super Meat Boy. But if your a new gamer looking for a challenge then you should definitely try this out.			"

												It was pretty fun, I enjoyed it. It was pretty addicting and i finished the game with 13 trinkets, I don't think I will be replaying the regular story again though. To me, the replay value is low.I raged a lot on some part, and I scared my dog when I raged on a part, so, if you don't want to rage and break something, this is not the game for you.			"

												If you're the type that gets hung up on little things like ""graphics"" or ""budget""  or ""titles that are pronouncable in a human language,"" this game probably isn't for you. If you're in it for the clever combat, hordes of brutal enemies and frenetically mounted defenses, this game isn't for you. (There's not even an attack button!) If you yearn for a masterfully paced narrative, this game probably isn't for you.Who, precisely, is this thing for?VVVVVV is, at first glance, a rudimentary platformer: with a bag of tricks consisting entirely of ""run"" and ""jump,"" progress through your environment without touching any of the many things which will make you dead. A simple gravity inversion mechanic (""down"" is whichever direction you're falling in) really changes things up though, and as you explore your surroundings the puzzles get steadily more challenging and engrossing. I've not played a game in recent memory that better satisfies that primal platforming itch. Highly recommended.			"

												Rules are simple - 3 buttons to push: -> , <-, and the ""revers gravity"" one, that's all, but the game is hard - just on the edge, where it doesn't break the flow or stops you.It is very energetic, it will make you panic, then will masterfuly play with your usual gaming reflexes and use them against you, this game is a great self-control tutor, but it not making you angry because your fails because checkpoints are Everywhere, plus there is not just single line of going through this tiny game, you also got some freedome.Add: I just cleared a few levels and my finger hurts! I shouted ""YAAAY!"" as I jumped up the celling and back, avoiding rushing things, then like ""nonoNOffff.. AAgh WTisthis!? runrunRUNjump ..AAAAAAh!"" all the time, can't remember me having fun of that intense while playing games for ages!  It allows you to travel back in time and experience that precious childish excitement and fun we had playing console games back then and even more, that seemed to be lost for good, this game - is pure minimalistic fun!

												I did complete this game (this does not happen to every game I play) and enjoyed it very much. First of all, the music is GREAT and complements whatever is happening on the screen very nicely. I am not a big fan of chiptune music, but this OST has some really catchy tunes and is of extremely good quality. The gameplay is very solid, just as the visuals it is retro-styled. However, due to very good placement of save-points VVVVVV is not as severly punishing as those games, by which it was obviously inspired. The storyline is not really important and does not add anything to the game. The graphics do the trick of making the game look really old-school and reminding me of many games I played in the past. I would by no means call them ""spectacular"", though. Overall the game gives you a good experience, which is fun, sometimes frustrating, but still makes you feel proud of yourself for accomplishing the obstacles without becoming excessively enraging.

Except for the ""escort quest"" spots that make up about 2 to 10 minutes of your time (depending on skill) I found the whole thing enjoyable.

												VVVVVV is, on the surface at least, simple in concept. You move like a standard platformer, but rather than be able to jump, you instead are able to flip gravity. What starts off as a simple concept very quickly becomes one of the most brutally hard platformers I can think of! I think the best way to describe VVVVVV is ""Nintendo Hard"". By this, I mean that the difficultly never feels forced or cheap, but rather 100% dependent on your skill level. Luckily, there is no set amount of lives, and the savepoints are placed in decent locations to allow you to trial and error your way past most of the deathtraps you will face. Death provides you with an instant respawn to get right back into retrying without being annoying. The game is setup as one big map, allowing to to explore in any direction as you seek out your 5 lost shipmates. The team is stranded in different areas of a giant space station, each with a unique level built around them. You can do the levels in any order you choose, or just explore around. If you are looking for a challenge, give it a go - but be warned; it's a tough one!			"

												Fun but short. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes indie games tend to overstay their welcome, despite of how unique they are. I'm quite sure it will keep me enticed for its duration.The visual style is what you'd expect, after seeing the screenies of the game. The music is awesome, once you start encountering various tracks. To say I'm not getting tired of it, as of yet.It's cheap. Do yourself a favor and pick it up. Or wait until there's another sale on it, making it near free imo.			"

												Highly entertaining little game based on the simple premise of reversing gravity whenever you jump. With so few different elements to the game (walking/moving and jumping basically) the game might normally get boring soon, but the creators did a nice job in designing a world with many different challenges which can be quite tough to crack. Especially given the low price, it's a good deal to buy the game, check it out, and spend a few hours enjoying yourself with this little game.			"

												VVVVVV is an incredible game and one of the best puzzle games ever.It starts by showing that all your crew has vanished and it's your job to find them, by exploring the rooms of your ship. The story isn't the selling point of the game, but it complements the game really well. It's probably the only way to give the game some logic. The twist here is that you have the power to change gravity, just by the push of a button. You can only change gravity when your in the ground/ceiling/surface or when you touch a ""gravity beam"". This power gives a lot of room for good game design and VVVVVV delivers it. It makes great use of this power and makes you think in ways you would never think before.But with this also comes a lot of frustration. Thankfully, VVVVVV shows that frustration may not lead to a rage quit. It's the type of frustration you get but you want to keep playing the game. Another very good thing VVVVVV delivers is it's music. The music is incredible and really brings nostalgic feelings of the 8bit era. Some of my favourite musics of this era are now from this game, which is odd, knowing this game was published in 2010.VVVVVV is a game that I highly recomend to a lot of people. Just don't expect the story to be the next final fantasy...VEREDICT: 9,5/10			"

												What a wonderful love letter to the age of 8-bit gaming! VVVVVV looks like an old Commodore 64/Atari 800 game, but feels like a modern platformer. The gameplay is wonderfully simplistic - challenging without being frustrating. The dialogue, controls and timings are all exemplary. The music is special. This is retro gaming at its very best and is definitely worth purchasing. The only thing I don't like about the game is the name. Six vees? Vee, vee, vee, vee, vee, vee? Terrible name, great game!

												Fun game if you like the retro feel and unlimited lives, however the movement in the game is sudden and the slight ""slide"" you have when you land or moving through the air is slightly annoying since barely tapping a direction usually ends up with you moving a lot farther then you intended.Tons of checkpoints which makes dying not that big of an issue, but way too many trick jumps for my liking.With that said I do recommend the game, its a good way to kill some time.

The whole Atari 2600-themed presentation is lazy and uninspired, even for an indie developer, but it still manages to be a decent little game. I sat down and was able to run through it and collect all the Easter eggs in under 4 hours, but the game sports enough bonus modes and player-created levels to keep you occupied for a bit longer. The $5 price tag on this one is about right, but the game appears often in Humble Indie Bundles, so if you can wait, you might want to save your pennies.			"

												This is probably my favorite game. No ""if""s ""and""s or ""butt""s about it. I don't usually like replaying games that have story lines(i.e. Half Life). But this game I can play over and over and it never gets old. I also love how challenging it is, a lot of games I've played I could just win no problem. Even though this game has infinite lives, that's honestly better. Because you can try over and over at one thing you keep dying at(which causes a little more frustration sometimes).However, I do have a single complaint on behalf of mac users. This game does not have an in game volume control, and since mac os does not have the equivalent of ""Windows Volume Mixer"". The sound track is at what the game sets it at. So if you like your own music(which you should just listen to VVVVVV's music, pretty good), or you talk to people while playing, you may want to get a third party volume control.			"

												Simplicity usually makes or breaks a game for me. In this case, it's definitely the former. The mere addition of gravity-reversing mechanic in what otherwise would be a Metroid-lookalike created a whole new experience. A challenging game with an amazing soundtrack, that only falls short in terms of length.			"

												I absolutely love the sound track to this game. The controls to me seem different in random places, as in the character tends to slide in some areas and not others. I am not sure if that is intentional.  This is a very difficult game in which you need to have quite a bit of patience. I am very impatient but the music kept it in it for me. I would recommend!			"

												I want to start by saying that VVVVVV is a rather difficult game. It's tricky, it requires some really hard timing, and at times it can be extremely frustrating. (Oh, also, seizure warning!)But the game makes it work, and it's absolutely genius. It's got an 8-bit, retro style and that beautiful creative touch that every indie game needs. The main mechanic, while not necessarily something that's never been done before, it certainly used cleverly and uniquely. Not only that, but the quirky storyline and amazing soundtrack keep the whole thing interesting and worthwhile even when you feel like pulling your hair out over a level you can't get past.It's evil, and I love it.Also, it has a level editor, which in my eyes doubles the value of any already good game. A fully featured one at that.10/10, would brave The Tower again.			"

												Rules are simple - 3 buttons to push: -> , <-, and the ""revers gravity"" one, that's all, but the game is hard - just on the edge, where it doesn't break the flow or stops you.It is very energetic, it will make you panic, then will masterfuly play with your usual gaming reflexes and use them against you, this game is a great self-control tutor, but it not making you angry because your fails because checkpoints are Everywhere, plus there is not just single line of going through this tiny game, you also got some freedome.Add: I just cleared a few levels and my finger hurts! I shouted ""YAAAY!"" as I jumped up the celling and back, avoiding rushing things, then like ""nonoNOffff.. AAgh WTisthis!? runrunRUNjump ..AAAAAAh!"" all the time, can't remember me having fun of that intense while playing games for ages!  It allows you to travel back in time and experience that precious childish excitement and fun we had playing console games back then and even more, that seemed to be lost for good, this game - is pure minimalistic fun!

												I did complete this game (this does not happen to every game I play) and enjoyed it very much. First of all, the music is GREAT and complements whatever is happening on the screen very nicely. I am not a big fan of chiptune music, but this OST has some really catchy tunes and is of extremely good quality. The gameplay is very solid, just as the visuals it is retro-styled. However, due to very good placement of save-points VVVVVV is not as severly punishing as those games, by which it was obviously inspired. The storyline is not really important and does not add anything to the game. The graphics do the trick of making the game look really old-school and reminding me of many games I played in the past. I would by no means call them ""spectacular"", though. Overall the game gives you a good experience, which is fun, sometimes frustrating, but still makes you feel proud of yourself for accomplishing the obstacles without becoming excessively enraging.

												Summers in Louisiana are hot.Last night I had a dream that Barack Obama had to move into my house. It turned out he was an alright guy, but he was incredibly naive and didn't really know what was going on in the world. He said he was pretty much just hired as an actor as president and that there were other people running things behind the scenes. He was really big on drinking ""soda pop"" and inventing secret handshakes.Later on I was forced by the government to retake my senior year of highschool because of some legal loophole, with Barack Obama frequently accompanying me against my will. At some point Legion from Mass Effect enrolled at my school and suddenly he became pregnant. Legion's child looked like he would if he was a Chinese knock-off, and was kind of a prick.			"

												If you're the type that gets hung up on little things like ""graphics"" or ""budget""  or ""titles that are pronouncable in a human language,"" this game probably isn't for you. If you're in it for the clever combat, hordes of brutal enemies and frenetically mounted defenses, this game isn't for you. (There's not even an attack button!) If you yearn for a masterfully paced narrative, this game probably isn't for you.Who, precisely, is this thing for?VVVVVV is, at first glance, a rudimentary platformer: with a bag of tricks consisting entirely of ""run"" and ""jump,"" progress through your environment without touching any of the many things which will make you dead. A simple gravity inversion mechanic (""down"" is whichever direction you're falling in) really changes things up though, and as you explore your surroundings the puzzles get steadily more challenging and engrossing. I've not played a game in recent memory that better satisfies that primal platforming itch. Highly recommended.			"

												One of the most delightful games I have played in a long time. VVVVVV goes further than just look retro, and the reverse gravity ability (instead of jumping) goes to great lengths to make it both enjoyable, and challenging. With a Metroid-vania style of map exploration system, this is one of the few games that actually makes me want to explore every nook and cranny. The music is a retro, 8-bit style delight, and the checkpoints are vast, which means you get back on your feet quickly. The game grows on you, and as you complete the game and find every secret, you feel a great satisfaction. Definitely a game for the retro platformers (some challenges can get quite difficult) but still a great game, even if you're not a fan of 2D platformers.			"

												One of the cleverest, funnest platformers I've ever played, but sadly also one of the shortest, with you being able to pass through the last room and complete a run through in under an hour. That is not to detract from it, it is a magnificent game, where you will die alot, with stragetically places checkpoints to throw you right back into those tiny, pixelated spikes.To combat the short play through, VVVVVV has some tricks up it's sleeves. You will unlock Time Trials of stages you've completed, be able to return to the intermission levels, you can scower the world for all twenty trinkets, and even play the full game over with the entire world flipped upside down, which for some reason makes it more difficult.Short, incredibly sweet and fairly cheap. Can't go wrong.			"

												Yet another retro platformer with apparent pixels and chiptunes music? Yes, but it is a perfectly crafted piece of fun. The difficulty is impressive but the checkpoints are numerous and well-placed for the die-die again-die many more times then succeed approach. The music is memorable and there is a good replay value (time trials, post-game challenges, collectibles...). So indulge yourself in the adventures of a captain searching for his crew in a deadly world.There is even a level editor (with some samples by indie devs) if you want to make other people suffer some more. Too bad the Steam integration has not been thought of (the overlay does not work and there is no way to share through Steam's workshop. Still this is a very minor complaint for a great little game.

It's a two hour experience (if you're good) that provides plenty of replayability to all the achievement hunters out there. The controls are easy to pick up, but can be very sensitive. The game tests your patience, so if you don't like games like Super Meat Boy or The Binding of Isaac then this game isn't your type of game. However, if you like a little challenge in your life, then pick this game up. It has catchy chiptune music, a decent story, and a fun world to explore. It gets a 7/10 from me.			"

												Without a doubt, VVVVVV is one of the hardest platformers around. It's also one of the best of its class.Don't let it's simple unsuspecting appearance fool you. Beneath the inviting Commodore 64-esque visuals lay a game of absolute terror. Not the usual sort of horror, mind you; it doesn't make you jump or mess with your mind. No, this game terrifies you with its sheer intense level design, demanding nothing less but total perfection to conquer its gantlet of doom. To best this game you need fortuity, to be able to hold steadfast in the face of adversity, and some crazy fast reflexes.I can't say enough good things about VVVVVV. It's Terry Cavanagh's best game to date, and one of the best and most difficult platformers I've ever played. If you have any interest in challenging platformers whatsoever, you'd be doing yourself a disservice not to pick up VVVVVV.			"

VVVVVV is what you get when you get a train, and then decide to place wheels on the roof, and tracks above it, then flip earth's gravity away from the core. Makes sense?

												VVVVVV is a great platformer and puzzle game with difficult levels that make you want to try over and over again. This is in no way a bad game. The classic retro style may not have the best graphics but that doesn't change anything. The music and tough level design fit well together and the story is small but awesome. You basically are Captain Viridian in some strange place after your ship crashed and need to explore and find the rest of your crew. I highly recommend this to fans of platformers, puzzle and retro style games. If you want to get into platformers this might be a challenge for you so try something easier like Mario or Kirby then maybe move on to games like this or Super Meat Boy. But if your a new gamer looking for a challenge then you should definitely try this out.			"

												Disregard everybody saying this takes 2-4 hours to beat. I did it in less than an hour in my first playthrough, and slowly cut time from there. There are 20 trinkets to collect and if you do that it will take longer, but most of them aren't too out of the way. There are two trinkets that together will take twice as long as it did to beat the game. It's worth it though. You may rage some but the game flows smoothly and constantly, so you can die 15 times in the span of a minute and still feel like you're making progress. Going by the achievement statistics, less than 10% of players managed to beat this game, which is in part a testification to its difficulty but honestly I think it's mostly that this is not everyone's game. If you like platformers, it doesn't get much better than this, but if you prefer 3D games that focus more on storyline than gameplay (nothing wrong with that), then you could pick a better game to start playing 2D again. Note: there are at times a lot of moving colors onscreen, but it's generally monochromatic - if you have epilepsy and are the photosensitive type you should be careful with this purchase, but know that it's not that bad and probably won't do anything (it's nothing at all like Super Hexagon).tl;dr If you're bad at 2D platformers and want to get better, buy this game but be ready to rage. If you like platformers, this game is amazing.			"

												Play VVVVVV. It's for Windows by Terry the man. It's amazing. I beat it, almost 100% now, a while back, but I still play it for time to time because it's fun. It's an action puzzle game where you play as a lost captain trying to find six crew members. You move around a big map and get crewmembers by going into dungeons and reaching the end. There are disks you can collect and it is really an exciting game. It's called VVVVVV because that's what the spikes look like, and you walk normally (left and right) and hit V to flip. Pretty simple, but the game style is beautiful and it is entertaining.			"

												This was my first game I owned on Steam. I'm happy to say that this game is well deserving of that statistic. It's unique gameplay and amazing soundtrack make this one of my favorite indie platformers ever.Story:You assume the role of Captain Viridian, the cyan-colored protagonist whose spaceship has become trapped in an alternative dimension thanks to dimensional interference. Viridian must now explore the dimension to find his five lost crew members and the cause of the interference.Gameplay:This is a platformer that feels unique. The biggest difference between this game and other platformers is that instead of jumping, you invert gravity, causing Viridian to flip between upside-down and right-side-up. You'll have to flip gravity and walk across both floors and ceilings to make your way through the game. It's an open-world game. It can be a bit difficult to navigate your way around even if you're using the map to help you, but this never felt like too much of a problem. There's also 20 trinkets to collect for those that want more out of the game.Conclusion:If you're a fan of 2D platformers, this game is definitely worth checking out. The soundtrack is amazing. and the gameplay is even better. You'll find yourself raging at some parts, but overall it makes for a fun indie game. It's biggest negative would be that it's rather short. It only took me about four to five hours to complete the story. The story wasn't anything special, but it was sufficient. The gameplay and soundtrack is what gives this game it's charm and makes it well worth the $5 that it costs.			"

												I did complete this game (this does not happen to every game I play) and enjoyed it very much. First of all, the music is GREAT and complements whatever is happening on the screen very nicely. I am not a big fan of chiptune music, but this OST has some really catchy tunes and is of extremely good quality. The gameplay is very solid, just as the visuals it is retro-styled. However, due to very good placement of save-points VVVVVV is not as severly punishing as those games, by which it was obviously inspired. The storyline is not really important and does not add anything to the game. The graphics do the trick of making the game look really old-school and reminding me of many games I played in the past. I would by no means call them ""spectacular"", though. Overall the game gives you a good experience, which is fun, sometimes frustrating, but still makes you feel proud of yourself for accomplishing the obstacles without becoming excessively enraging.

												I want to start by saying that VVVVVV is a rather difficult game. It's tricky, it requires some really hard timing, and at times it can be extremely frustrating. (Oh, also, seizure warning!)But the game makes it work, and it's absolutely genius. It's got an 8-bit, retro style and that beautiful creative touch that every indie game needs. The main mechanic, while not necessarily something that's never been done before, it certainly used cleverly and uniquely. Not only that, but the quirky storyline and amazing soundtrack keep the whole thing interesting and worthwhile even when you feel like pulling your hair out over a level you can't get past.It's evil, and I love it.Also, it has a level editor, which in my eyes doubles the value of any already good game. A fully featured one at that.10/10, would brave The Tower again.			"

												I wouldn't say it's worth the full asking retail price of $5, but whenever it drops to a buck or so, it's worth picking up. Can get through the game from scratch in just an hour and a half easy, if your reflexes are good enough, and it'd be an hour and a half well spent.While the game sticks to the mechanic of ""run around and flip gravity to get through areas"" it changes the rules or environment in each of the areas in a way that keeps it interesting. Except for the ""escort quest"" spots that make up about 2 to 10 minutes of your time (depending on skill) I found the whole thing enjoyable. Final level's rough, and some of the shiny trinkets are asking too much, but they're not necessary.So yeah, worth the hour or two it will ask of you. Also a good candidate for speedrunning, if that's your thing!			"

												VVVVVV is an incredible game and one of the best puzzle games ever.It starts by showing that all your crew has vanished and it's your job to find them, by exploring the rooms of your ship. The story isn't the selling point of the game, but it complements the game really well. It's probably the only way to give the game some logic. The twist here is that you have the power to change gravity, just by the push of a button. You can only change gravity when your in the ground/ceiling/surface or when you touch a ""gravity beam"". This power gives a lot of room for good game design and VVVVVV delivers it. It makes great use of this power and makes you think in ways you would never think before.But with this also comes a lot of frustration. Thankfully, VVVVVV shows that frustration may not lead to a rage quit. It's the type of frustration you get but you want to keep playing the game. Another very good thing VVVVVV delivers is it's music. The music is incredible and really brings nostalgic feelings of the 8bit era. Some of my favourite musics of this era are now from this game, which is odd, knowing this game was published in 2010.VVVVVV is a game that I highly recomend to a lot of people. Just don't expect the story to be the next final fantasy...VEREDICT: 9,5/10			"

Not only aesthetically pleasing, rich in environments and elaborate in the soundtrack, it can also offer you quite a challenge if you decide to pursue the trinkets.VVVVVV really teaches an important lesson about making games: you don't always need complex and elaborate mechanics to create a pleasing experience.It's more crucial to make something fun to play, a little crazy, and polish out all (or most) quirks. All of this is present into the game, and I can tell for sure the developers really loved it themselves before shipping it to us.			"

												This is probably my favorite game. No ""if""s ""and""s or ""butt""s about it. I don't usually like replaying games that have story lines(i.e. Half Life). But this game I can play over and over and it never gets old. I also love how challenging it is, a lot of games I've played I could just win no problem. Even though this game has infinite lives, that's honestly better. Because you can try over and over at one thing you keep dying at(which causes a little more frustration sometimes).However, I do have a single complaint on behalf of mac users. This game does not have an in game volume control, and since mac os does not have the equivalent of ""Windows Volume Mixer"". The sound track is at what the game sets it at. So if you like your own music(which you should just listen to VVVVVV's music, pretty good), or you talk to people while playing, you may want to get a third party volume control.			"

												If you ever loved in your life, you should totally play this game.The adventure makes me recall the time I lived in the streets of Devonshire, everything was so complicated, even asking for some change was troublesome, and suddenly,  there were everywhere! In this game you play as a charismatic astrounaut who has lost his friends, deep huh? You have to cross many obstacles to save your lost crew while listening to brilliant music. Did you know that I love music?It's beautiful and challenging, like love.			"

												VVVVVV is a throwback to the sidescrollers of old, with elements of Super Mario Bros, I Wanna Be the Guy, and Portal. The game revolves around Captain Viridian, who can navigate the world by shifting the gravity at will. This unique ability allows for some very interesting and challenging situations, and overall a very fulfilling, exciting game.If you're up to the challenge, I highly recommend you buy this game.			"

												The controls in VVVVVV are very tight and responsive, the gameplay is challenging, but it never feels unfair. The soundtrack is a fun retro-themed set of beats. Very catchy, too. The graphics are also very nostalgic with some trippy backgrounds.My only gripe with VVVVVV is the fact that the main campaign is too short, lasting only around 3 hours. However, to combat this, many other things are added such as player levels, a level editor and more features I won't spoil.9/10			"

												Yet another retro platformer with apparent pixels and chiptunes music? Yes, but it is a perfectly crafted piece of fun. The difficulty is impressive but the checkpoints are numerous and well-placed for the die-die again-die many more times then succeed approach. The music is memorable and there is a good replay value (time trials, post-game challenges, collectibles...). So indulge yourself in the adventures of a captain searching for his crew in a deadly world.There is even a level editor (with some samples by indie devs) if you want to make other people suffer some more. Too bad the Steam integration has not been thought of (the overlay does not work and there is no way to share through Steam's workshop. Still this is a very minor complaint for a great little game.

												Long story short, I can recommend this game to anyone who enjoys difficult but doable puzzle platforming, and perhaps even a bit of exploration tastes too. If you like 100%ing games.VVVVVV is challenging, but quite fair, most of the time. Uh....I guess there isn't really much of a long story. If you can't tell by the screenshots, the game has a visual style reflecting older game systems such as ...well, something a tad more powerful than an atari, perhaps. The era between atari and NES is lost to me. But yeah, really retro graphical style, but it works to its advantage since it leaves less of a busy screen thus letting you focus better. Except one area, which brings me to something else:IF YOU ARE VULNERABLE TO SEIZURES, and whatnot, DO NOT GET THIS. There's one area of the game that just messes with your eyes too nasty-like that left me feeling sick after playing. That's the only real downer, I have to say.Musically, it's great. It's easy on the ears, some reminds me of Toki Tori on the gameboy color with it's bleeps an' bloops,  but it's chiptune stuff so if you're into to that or not, there you go.So, if you like teasing your brain, are not able to seize out, and are fine with trying over and over at things many many times, then get this game, because it was well worth what I spent, I tell ya.

												Platforming with a twist. VVVVVV is an excellent example of a good platformer that has been made better by adding an original, interesting core game mechanic. In VVVVVV, you play as Captain Viridian who must rescue his crew after a disaster nearly destroys his ship. Traveling all around a strange new universe called ""VVVVVV"", you must rescue each crew member in their own zone of the map. Each new zone introduces a new game mechanic such as moving maps, bouncy ropes, and NPC co-op.VVVVVV's system of introducing new mechanics allows you to adjust to each challenge before entering the last stages of the game which require you to navigate maps containing every mechanic simultaneously. This isn't an easy game, but not too hard to beat if you're persistent. Many of the most challenging puzzles are previously-optional challenges which are required to reach a treasure. Veni Vidi Vici. After completing the main story and collecting every treasure, you receive a special reward.			"

I really reminded me of the NES era of games where things were pretty difficult, only that this game gives you infinite lives. I don't think that anything about this game is bad except for the short amount of gameplay the game gives if you play through it normally. I completed it in under a day and in 3 hours. Finally, all I can really say about this game is that it is AWESOME and you should definitely get it. :)			"

From the moment you step out of the tutorial you are able to explore the entire world using your single ability to flip gravity.

The controls are tight and the soundtrack is delightfuly catchy. Fans of games like Metroid or Castlevania will enjoy the exploration present in the game.			"

												An absolutely terrific experience, this game shows no need to insert unnecessary gimmicks or elements into any of its standard levels. Instead, Cavanagh's VVVVVV opts to take its core, the gravity-flip mechanic, to its extreme, easing players from simple early levels to some of the most rewarding puzzles and stages ever in the later game and maintaining use of infinite lives and checkpoints throughout so as not to cheat the player. The core ""story"" (the plot is relatively unimportant) can be finished in two hours or less, but time trials, collectibles, and a sense of exploration that recalls the original Zelda or even Adventure makes this game worth playing over and over again. Forever.Also, the music is fantastic. So yeah, just buy this already.			"

												Besides Shovel Knight, VVVVVV is the pinnacle of 8-bit indie games. The soundtrack is spectacular, the gameplay is responsive and solid yet very simple and addicting. The minor story might even fuel your desire to finish the game a little faster than you'd want to. And if the game's shortness sounds unattractive, just know that you have many other options such as different modes to play through that change how you play through the game, the optional collectible 'trinkets' to gather, the surprisingly difficult achievements to overcome, and the quality user-created levels all to overcome and keep yourself occupied once you beat the main story.

												TL;DR, it's an overall pretty good platforming game, and worth checking out.So, overall, I like VVVVVV. It was an enjoyable experience with an awesome soundtrack and a simple, yet creative mechanic that a lot is done with. But it's not a perfect game. It does have some problems. The smaller ones are very small, to be fair, such as the overall length of the game. It is a short game. I beat it in a little over an hour. Granted, the length is up in the air, depending on your overall skill at the game itself, but it's still a short game. So, if you are looking for a longer game, this might not be for you. Another problem with this game, is the ""escort"" missions. The distance that those following you follow at isn't ever defined, and that can often lead to frustating moments in the more difficult sections of the escort missions.Now, the biggest problem I had with the game is the controls. Your character slides a fair bit, which wouldn't be the biggest issue in most games, but in this game, when you have to be very precise in your movements, you can often slide off the sides of platforms if you land a little too close to the edge. Early on, this is very unnoticable, as it's a little easier overall, but later in the game, it often leads to a large number of seemingly unfair deaths.But, besides those main issues, this game has a lot of good going for it. Interesting use of mechanics, amazing music that keeps you hyped throughout the game, and a great feeling of success each time you beat a level. If I had to give this a number rathing, it's say it's about a 7/10 game.			"

												A solid, fun platformer. The unusual jumping mechanic of reversing gravity is a bit disorienting at first but I got used to it fast and it makes for some unique platforming gameplay. To me, what makes this one worth playing through to the end is that the difficulty is just right - challenging without being punishing. Of course, if you're into frustration, some of the optional paths are crazy hard enough for anyone.  There are also multiple paths to reach your goals, and you're free to do them in any order you want, which adds a nice element of exploration. Thumbs up!			"

I died 762 times to complete the game!The soundtrack is so beautiful and together with the graphics brings back so many memories that I bought it as soon as I completed the game: go to http://www.souleye.se/pppppp to buy MP3s or FLACs.

												VVVVVV is a platformer with a simple twist: you don't jump, you flip gravity upside-down.The first thing you will notice is the super low-fi visual style of the game. Plenty of indie titles have a classic 2D retro look that reminds the player of the game consoles of the late 80s and early 90s, but VVVVVV takes it to a new level, evoking the games of the Commodore 64. The simple sprites, eight color pallette, and bold, minimalist levels create a game that is simple to understand and as distinctive as they come.VVVVVV also rocks one of the best soundtracks out there, with a chiptune soundtrack courtesy of Magnus Pålsson that infuses the game with an energy that enhances the experience in a brilliant way.Unlike the classic games it resembles, VVVVVV presents its simple story within the game itself (instead of in the manual). You are Captain Viridian, and your ship has been caught in a dimensional anomaly. You are tasked with rescuing each of your crew members, who have been scattered throughout the strange dimension. After finding each crewmember, you will bring them back to the ship, get a tiny piece of information about your situation, and head back out for another. It's a simple premise that serves the game well enough.Using the gravity-flipping mechanic, you traverse a sprawling 2D map in every direction. The most common obstacle you must avoid are the spikes from which the game takes its name (they look like a row of Vs). Other obstacles may be bouncing shapes or even cannons that shoot words at you. Death is a common occurance in VVVVVV, but dying will simply cause you to respawn at the last checkpoint you tagged, which are abundant and typically placed at the start of each room or challenge. The respawn is instantaneous, which gives VVVVVV the same fun, forgiving feel as Super Meat Boy. A challenge may take you dozens of tries to complete, but you will feel like you are learning, improving, and progressing throughout. Even at its most challenging (and VVVVVV can be brutally difficult at times), I never felt frustrated by the experience.The map is also divided into different regions, distinguished by a new environment color. These zones each have a signiture mechanic that alters the way you interact with the level. All are intuitive, and they bring enough variety to keep the experience fresh for the duration of the game.On the whole, VVVVVV is a game that succeeds at every level. It is simple, elegant, and amazingly fun. Not many games offer challenge without frustration quite like this. Even if platformers aren't your favorite genre, I still highly recommend VVVVVV.			"

												My first playthrough of ""VVVVVV"" took me 2.75 hours. In that time, I died 1070 times. (The game helpfully keeps count). That's 6.5x a minute, or just shy of once every 9 1/3 seconds. Little wonder there's a section of the game titled ""Your Bitter Tears ... Delicious."" (In my darkest moments, there were times that I thought a better title would have been ""OMG F--K THIS GAME!!!!1"") And yet in the end, I enjoyed myself quite a lot. Really, I swear.The basic idea: flip, bounce, and ceiling-walk to avoid spikes and other assorted 8-bit hazards. Rescue fellow space-crew members. Enjoy the awesome chiptune soundtrack. Try not to ragequit when the going gets tough, as it often does (though never game-killingly so). The mechanics and presentation are simple; the skill needed to solve the various environmental puzzles and execute the precision jumps are a bit more advanced. Luckily the game is consistently fun and cheekily aware of its own difficulty, so that it remains not just enjoyable but likable throughout.There's a plot, I guess. Something to do with a spaceship and a dimensional shambler. A running joke throughout the game is that almost none of the characters even claim to understand what's going on, either.

												Recommended to hardcore oldschool gamers only!Best platformer I played in the last 15 years (yes you have to go back in time to find something better!).Level design is brilliant and evil at the same time, but it won't lead to (excessive) frustration, because when you die you immediately respawn without any downtime and you don't have a limited number of lives so essentially you can die hundreds of times. I died 762 times to complete the game!The soundtrack is so beautiful and together with the graphics brings back so many memories that I bought it as soon as I completed the game: go to http://www.souleye.se/pppppp to buy MP3s or FLACs.

												VVVVVV is an old-school-charmer built on two simple principles: you can invert gravity, and if you touch a spike you die. Sounds simple enough! It's that simple premise that makes the game so easy to pick up, and also so easy to wedge a pickax through your keyboard. Fans of VERY old-school games will probably enjoy this most of all. It's surprisingly longer than you'd expect (took me 2 hours to complete, in short 25-minute bursts, with full grief counseling sessions in between), and the music is absolutely ROCKING. Definitely recommended when on sale (I picked it up for 50 cents, an absolute steal).When you beat it, wear it like a badge of honor, just like you did when you beat Battletoads on the NES.			"

												Voilà! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valourous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition! The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it's my very good honour to meet you and you may call me V.VVVVVV is a fabulous pixel-style game, created by super-addictive Super Hexagon's creator Terry Cavanagh. It can be considered both enjoyable and annoyingly difficult. I love the plot, the names of those levels, along with the symbolic enemies....(I'll finish this comment several days later)			"

												VVVVVV is one of those games that at first you look at it like a budget indie title, with plain graphics and a chiptune soundtrack that (at first) doesn't catch your attention.Then it blows your mind, from the moving puzzles to the gravity mechanic that you use the whole game, and the epic soundtrack for each section of the map.

												How do you make an amazing game based on one mechanic? By making VVVVVV, of course. The concept of this game is that you can flip gravity with the press of a key, and you'll end up on the ceiling. The game uses this idea exceptionally, with lots of fun areas and puzzles to explore. With its simple graphics and awesome soundtrack, this is one of the best indie games of our time.			"

												Pretty good game, with about 2 hours of gameplay if you don't go for the secrets.This game involves the use of your ability to reverse gravity to traverse dangerous levels. You can only switch gravity while on the ground (or ceiling), though, meaning you can't change direction while in mid-air.You are a space captain and your team is flying through space. Suddenly, the crew is evacuated due to a catastrophe, and you must find your way back as well as save the other members of your crew. The gameplay is solid, but it gets frustrating after about ten deaths in the same room (or the same checkpoint). That isn't to say this game is bad. It's an excellent indie game that everyone should at least try, especially if it's on sale.			"

VVVVVV is amongst my favourite platformers of all time, it's simple yet charming pixel graphicstyle gives the game it's own ""uniqueness"" and I can probably say that it makes it feel  like a really old game. The sountrack is AMAZING and it features some of the best chiptunes tracks I ever seen on a game and I simply love it. The story is nothing special, atleast for me. What makes VVVVVV an excellent game it's his simple yet well polished flipping mechanic along with some optional exploration and high precision platforming sections which might make the game abit frustrating, this is definitely a great platformer and a great game, buy it, support the dev, play it, ENJOY IT!

												8.5/10VVVVVV brings few ideas to the table. It has a simple control scheme, a simple art style, and a forgetable story yet this lets the game explore and perfect gameplay. Each level has a slight twist on the basic game mechanic, switching gravity. One level is autoscrolling and another has trampolines, for example. These different level ideas allow for the game not to get stale.This game is hard. You will die and die a lot, especially if you are hoping to get the 20 collectables. I died over 2000 times in my first playthrough. Luckily, the punishment for death is nearly non-existant with many checkpoints scattered throughout the levels. This game feels fair with its deaths and most of the time when I died I would blame myself not the game. This game requires trial and error to grasp the level design and mechanics but completing this game is a rewarding task.The game is relatively short yet there is some things to do after you beat the game, including time trials and flip mode. Also, with user created levels, the game could extend indefinately.Overall, retro fans that enjoy a little difficulty will enjoy VVVVVV. The game does away with flashy components and goes back to NES era games. The level design was incredibly well thought out and therefore this game gets my strong recommendation.8.5/10			"

												This game is an absolute masterpiece. Very few games can keep people playing after dying hundreds of times. I'm guessing that it has something to do with the amazing music present in the game. If you're playing for the first time, you'll likely finish the story in 2-3 hours with maybe 600 or so deaths.       Fortunately, completing the story is only part of the fun. If you're going for 100%, you'll also have a chance to experience the joy of going back through the game and hunting down all 20 Trinkets (I'm sure you'll love the Veni Vidi Vici Trinket) the insane speed trials (Where you have to complete levels in the game within a pre-determined time frame), the more-than fun Super Gravitron (Your goal is to survive 1 full minute during which all you can do is move left and right to avoid a never-ending onslaught of obstacles coming from both sides. My personal best for that is a bit above 20 seconds), and of course, trying to get the hardest achievement in the game, which is......No Death ModeAs the name implies, you have to beat the entire game with only 1 life. Screw up even once, and you're back at the start. You're guaranteed to have fun dodging broken hearts, surviving the Gravitron for 60 seconds straight, avoiding spikes, and clinging on to dear life in the Dial M For Murder room.    If you find that mode too easy, you can always do an all-trinket no death run, I guess. "

												This is the most rage inducing game I have ever played in my life. It's complicated, challenging, exciting and innovative. I love and equally hate every single aspect of this game which is why I've been playing it on and off for the last 3 years. You'll hate yourself while you play this game, but the accomplishment you feel when you beat it is undenyably overwhelmingly amazing.			"

												I just can't stay silent anymore! I LOVE THIS GAME TO DEATH! It's a retro-style masterpiece! So old-school, pretty challenging, so fun and... the music! OMG, the music! Cheerful, lively digital music that can be enjoyed even separately, but it's an amazing background to your gameplay. Makes it all so pleasant and personally stopped me from raging when I kept failing. Puts in great mood. The game itself requires only 3 keys, you pretty much just run left and right and flip the gravity to get past all the spikes. This game is an indie gem.			"

												This is a very fun platformer, but I can only recommend it on a condition: if bright lights and strobes do not affect you. Some of the levels are intense, and I found myself sort of spacing out and getting lost in the bright colorful lights. I can't imagine what this would do to someone with epilepsy, but it would definitely be very bad. As it is, I had to turn it off after playing the same level for about five minutes and not being able to make the jump because it was changing between screens so rapidly and the colors were so bright that I couldn't take it. And I'm not epileptic, I've never had this kind of problem with a game before. So yes, I recommend it, in short doses to people who aren't bothered by strobes of light and color. But I can't imagine myself playing this for an hour or two straight, it's really more of a ""take five minutes to enjoy the soundtrack"" kind of game.--------------------------------------------------------------------If you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

												This is amongst one of the best examples that graphics do not make a game what it actually is. VVVVVV is amongst my favourite platformers of all time, it's simple yet charming pixel graphicstyle gives the game it's own ""uniqueness"" and I can probably say that it makes it feel  like a really old game. The sountrack is AMAZING and it features some of the best chiptunes tracks I ever seen on a game and I simply love it. The story is nothing special, atleast for me. What makes VVVVVV an excellent game it's his simple yet well polished flipping mechanic along with some optional exploration and high precision platforming sections which might make the game abit frustrating, this is definitely a great platformer and a great game, buy it, support the dev, play it, ENJOY IT!

												An enjoyable retro-style game: nonlinear, full of checkpoints and therefore not as hard as they usually said.

It's got awesome music, it's got brilliant puzzle design, it's got fun, it's got platforms, it's got being upside-down. Great little game. Maybe 3 hours long depending on how thorough you are and how bad you are at platformers. Not much in terms of story, but really solid, engaging platforming / puzzle / exploration gameplay.9/10 if you like this sort of thing.			"

												Awesome music, non-standart gameplay mechanic and incredible retro-vibe will make you wonder, why doesn't this game support Atari 2600 joysticks. Certainly a must-have for those who just can't let go of them '80s.P.S. DO NOT spend more than 3 minutes 18 seconds in the elephant room. You won't recover from that.			"

												A fun little platformer with a nice retro aesthetic.  Fun mechanics, shallow learning curve, and great music.  Without a doubt, ""Doing things the Hard way"" is the single trial that will have you pulling your hair out, but the rest of the game's trails can be completed reasonably easily with just a little practice.  Not much replay value except for die-hard completionists, but well worth at least one play-through.			"

												I bought this during the summer sale (it cost less than a loaf of bread) and what a bargain it turned out to be!The game is short but what it lacks in length, it brings lots of difficulty instead. It's a great wee game that's built around solid core mechanics, with some very slight metroidvania elements. Don't go looking for an in depth story though, you'll be playing this for some intense, punishing puzzles.And of course, like most people are saying... killer soundtrack.			"

												This game is unique. It has a great soundtrack. It's challenging. There's really no reason not to buy it. For a game that I thought was just a funny jumping game, it really got me invested in the storyline, which although is short, is fun and makes sense, something that I feel a lot of games don't do. I love it.My only three cons are not even about the gameplay, which I feel is incredible.1. The game is short, it only took me about 2 hours to beat it, but it has a lot of replay value, as most of the achievements/alternate modes are unlockable/achievable after beating the game.2. If you are epileptic, you shouldn't buy this. I won't say when, but the game at some point has a lot of flashing colors.3. If you rage easily (no offense) then you probably shouldn't  buy this either. You will die A LOT on your first run.tl;dr 10/10 I very much recommend this game to anyone looking for a very unique and challenging game.			"

												A very fun, simple and addictive game. It's a retro style platformer based off of the mechanic of flipping gravity rather than jumping.Pros:-Fun and Addictive-I personally like the retro graphics, more akin to the Commodore 64-Lovable Characters-May not be the most original game, But it's still great!-Many things to do after beating the game! Such as getting all the trinkets, unlocking a hidden area, playing a VERY frustrating minigame, doing time trials, playing the game in flipped mode and of couse, NO DEATH MODE!!!!-It's hard, but fair! Just like Super meat boy (Another game I love)-The great retro Music, My favourites being ""Positive force"" and ""Potential for anything""Cons:-Sadly, It's quite shortThat's the only Con I can think of.Get this game! It's only £3.99! That's quite cheap, even cheaper than Super Meat Boy!This game is certainly worth your time and money! "

												All this game has going for it is its retro style, especially the music which I really enjoyed.The gameplay though is frustrating and tedious.  You die over and over as you try and precisely time your key-presses to navigate a tricky section full of spikes or other nasties.  There're always savepoints before the difficult sections and respawning is very fast but these are not enough to remove the frustration.The story is poorly written but you probably wouldn't play a game like this for the story anyway.VVVVVV is worth trying out if you're into difficult platformers.  Otherwise it's not worth your time.			"

Игра действительно очень ну оооочень тяжелая. Я некогда так не психовал. Реально, игра так на психику действует что просто хочется орать когда ти упал на эти КОНЧЕНЫЕ препятствия! Бесит. Но игра в своем жанре на высоте. Красивое оформление, приятная 8-битная музыка и графика, интресные мисии и много другое. Конечно может комуто цена не понравится, то ждите скидку.

												Innovative little platformer. The graphics are extremely simple though, very basic. In this game you have to find your friends. There are a lot of spiked platforms and you can avoid them by pressing a button to switch the gravity. So instead of walking, you'll then fall down and you're able to avoid them. It sounds easier than it actually is. It can be quite difficult. So if you're into hard platformers add this one to your list. The price is very good.[Rating: 77/100]			"

												VVVVVV is a challenging yet short indie platformer that is well worth the cost and a lovely fun time as a whole. The game's main innovative platforming mechanic of doing away with jumps and instead allowing the player to flip gravity in the opposite direction is delightfully fun and memorable. The characters in the game are likable even without a gripping, dramatic story and long dialogues, and the environment is easy to understand and fun to explore. Overall, the game has an atmosphere that's hard to describe perfectly, I feel. This game's only noticable short-coming, if I had to give it one, is its length; it's not too terribly long, giving the average player somewhere in the ballpark of six to twelve hours of gameplay. However short this game is, though, I absolutely recommend it. Great things come in small packages, eh? Terry Cavanagh did an excellent job as a lone developer.Special attention must be paid to this game's music, composed by Magnus Pålsson. This game is worth the price you pay just for the game's soundtrack alone. I'm a video game music aficionado, and this game has one of my favorite soundtracks amongst all games I've ever played. Please, do yourself a favor and either play this game or find and listen to the soundtrack by itself. Add this amazing music to a wonderful, impressionable game? Just, damn... it's too good. It's truly incredible.			"

												Игра супер!!! Поиграл 30 минут, но казалось я играю сутки. За эти пол часа я успел: поорать, кинуть пару раз мышь в стену, поржать, поплакать и наиграться в это ТЯЖЕЛО-АДСКУЮ игру. Игра действительно очень ну оооочень тяжелая. Я некогда так не психовал. Реально, игра так на психику действует что просто хочется орать когда ти упал на эти КОНЧЕНЫЕ препятствия! Бесит. Но игра в своем жанре на высоте. Красивое оформление, приятная 8-битная музыка и графика, интресные мисии и много другое. Конечно может комуто цена не понравится, то ждите скидку. А так моя оценка 5+ :D			"

												OK, a serious review this time - maybe this game simply wasn't *for* me. I've never really been a fan of retro-styled platformers, probably because I didn't grow up with them so the nostalgia doesn't really do anything for me. I've tried to play some of the classics but the ones that do hold up (Mega Man, Gimmick!) still have plenty of gameplay flaws that their indie counterparts don't seem to want to let go of.VVVVVV has a great, great soundtrack (I even bought it) but it's an immensely frustating game in a way that it's arcade contemporary Super Meat Boy is not. You respawn instantly, like that game, but with an irritating sound effect that feels like a punishment for dying. The odd control scheme is slippery and feels inconsistent, although I'll admit some people have mastered it enough to speedrun it. And, unlike many of Super Meat Boy's levels where you see what is coming far before tackling it, VVVVVV by design blindsides you with its Zelda-style screen scrolls into traps you have no time to prepare for. Veni Vidi Vici is the quintessential example of this design philosophy in action.What this results in is a game that is entirely based on trial-and-error. That's really all it has - the actual platforming isn't fun due to the slow pace and iffy controls, so what it does instead is throw a bunch of gimmicks at you while you slowly inch your way through an Atari-skinned meat grinder. There's some elements of exploration in the hub world (one of the songs is even called Passion For Exploring) but nothing to really do in it, making it just a fancy version of a level select.This could all be fine if the game was charming or interesting enough to make up for these flaws (Gimmick! is also a frustrating game with a lot of trial-and-error) but, unfortunately, it really isn't. The characters are literally stick figures. The world is mostly blocks and spikes with an occasionally cute theme or object in a room, reinforced by the nice touch of giving every room its own name, but its very barebones.Obviously, many people have enjoyed VVVVVV a lot, and saying something binary like ""this game is the worst thing ever"" is silly and unfair. But my honest opinion is that it's just not worth the short time you put into it.			"

This review recommends Terry Cavanagh's VVVVVV as a game of challenging, well-designed gameplay which also manages to have high artistic merit.[. . .] VVVVVV is a game whose aesthetics set an incomparably other-wordly mood plucked straight out of 1980s video game logic. Meanwhile, the deservedly lauded level design ties the project together for a respectably challenging campaign. [. . .][Click here to continue reading this review][thegemsbok.com] "

												An indie Metroidvania with a clever gravity-reversing mechanic, great chiptune music, and personality.  I got it as part of a Humble Bundle, but it's worth buying. Be aware there's a 3DS version if portability is worth the extra cost.			"

												VVVVVV is an incredible game.Its soundtracks are delicious. Word can barely describe how good and fitting the songs in this game are.The history is lovely and addicting, you always want to know what's going to happen when you complete a level, and how such character will react to their destiny.The gameplay is hard itself, but unbelievably well done. I can barely begin to think on how I could describe this game's playability, you have to play it for yourself, it's spot-on!Concluding, this game is amazing, it will overload your brain with fun, rage, history, drama-packed, and awesomeness. All packed into this awesome game!Get this game, it's one of the best games ever made.			"

												That may seem hyperbolic, but the attention to detail put into this game really shows. I've always like retro videogame soundtracks, but Palsson's chiptune work is sublime here. The game is short, and the plot is sparse, but IMO it's exactly as long and detailed as it needs to be to accomplish what it's trying to here. It distills the essence of platformers down to an hour or three of madcap wall-bouncing with no apologies.Segments of this game can be brutally hard, but never feel unfair. You can dive face first into the same set of spikes 5 times in a row, for the same reasons, but still feel like you're learning how to dodge it better on the 6th try. You're EXPECTED to dive face first into spikes... over and over... which is why there are checkpoints in basically every room (sometimes several in the SAME room!) to give you almost zero delay on death, like all the best torture-platformers. If you want to collect all of the Shiny Trinkets, there are some real gems of happy frustration to be found (one with an actual note laughing at those with the guts to try it). If you want a smooth, easy ride, or if your manual dexterity isn't what it used to be, then you may get overly frustrated here, but if not...Overall, if you like platformers, and you like chiptune music, and you like supporting indie games, why don't you have this yet?

												Everything about this game is deceptively simple: The only mechanic is flipping gravity, but the puzzles and unlikely obstacles you'll encounter are great. With the in-game achievements and some of the harder collectibles, experiences can range from an enjoyable run through a gravity-inverting puzzle platformer, to a masochistic march through pain and tears. Pick your poison- They're both fantastic.			"

												Easily one of the best platforms ive played in a long while. The game is great. The levels are challenging, and sometimes appear daunting, but with a little practice (or luck) they can be overcome with great satisfaction. Souleye did a wonderous job on the retro style music for this, and the sounds harken back to the old-school days of 8-bit platformers. While it is on the short side, the difficulty of the game and its unlockable gamemodes and challenges keep it fun for much longer. Its open-world style map can be a bit confusing, and you may find yourself in an area much more challenging than what you are ready for, but if you do find yourself in a situation like that, you can leave the area and try somewhere else. If you havn't given this game a try, I seriously reccomend playing the free demo and getting the game. VVVVVV is a great platformer with great gameplay, a great soundtack, and enough challenge to keep you playing for hours, and its low price makes it even better.			"

												SoThis game is the best I've played in a long timeIt's super fun and awesomethe main game is really short but there's a bunch of custom levels and a few of them are actually really good so you'll get 10+ hours if you play most of themit's hard but not frustrating at all except for like 2 partsthere's a bunch of stuff to do if you're into completion Although one of the areas is legitimately impossible to 'V'-rank in time trial even though there's a trophy for doing soIt feels super rewarding to play and the difficulty of each area seems to curve nicelyand if you're into level design there's a really good level editor and the developer feaures good levels on his blog from time to timethis game is like the best platformer I've played in a while 99/100 with the 1 being 'Not As I Do' ♥♥♥♥ that room			"

												VVVVVV? More like FFFUUUU. This game is fun and is an inde game. Great music and everything is 8-Bit. It gets hard at later levels and to get all the trinkets you will have to be really good.			"

												An indubiably difficult and challenging platformer with a twist! So relentlessly frustrating, it is one of those games that I want to meet the designer (to punch him in the face! :) ). The world is eerie and sublime harkening back to 8-bit brilliance but has a wonderful marriage of gameplay and an excellent sci-fi story justifying everything. And the music goes right along with the eerie 8bit sci-fi vibe. SOOOOOO Satisying that I beat it...So satisfying...but egad those trinkets! we hates the trinketsses forever!			"

												There's not much more to say about this game: it's a work of genius and a must for every old school gamer raised with bread and C64. The amazing part is that the entire game could have been done on a real c64 (a part from the music, the color palette and obviously disk only). It's a game from the future that could have been done exactly as it is in the past. I like to imagine the reaction of the gaming community back in the eighties if presented with a game like this...it blows my mind!			"

												Easily one of the best platforms ive played in a long while. The game is great. The levels are challenging, and sometimes appear daunting, but with a little practice (or luck) they can be overcome with great satisfaction. Souleye did a wonderous job on the retro style music for this, and the sounds harken back to the old-school days of 8-bit platformers. While it is on the short side, the difficulty of the game and its unlockable gamemodes and challenges keep it fun for much longer. Its open-world style map can be a bit confusing, and you may find yourself in an area much more challenging than what you are ready for, but if you do find yourself in a situation like that, you can leave the area and try somewhere else. If you havn't given this game a try, I seriously reccomend playing the free demo and getting the game. VVVVVV is a great platformer with great gameplay, a great soundtack, and enough challenge to keep you playing for hours, and its low price makes it even better.			"

												Se muy bien que he tenido muy poco tiempo jugando este juego, pero es que creo que con eso ya es suficiente para entender la logica y la fisica de este juego. Es tan simple como darle al boton de espacio para darle la vuelta a ti mismo, o, la gravedad, asi por decirlo. Cabe destacar que este juego siempre tiene claros mensajes entre nivel y nivel. Algunos te hacen pensar sobre la vida, otros, nada. Juego recomendado a aquellos que buscan algo simple, divertido, y un reto.			"

												This is a minimalist game with great platforming and music. In most platforming games you have the ability to jump whereas in this game whenever you press up you flip, turning the ceiling into the floor and the floor into the ceiling. The level design is very clever and you are left with a great sense of accomplishment when you get past a particularly difficult part. Even after completion this game kept me coming back to see if I could improve my high score in the Super Gravitron. Highly recommended.			"

												VVVVVV takes its name from the game's main objective, which I shall not touch upon in order to leave the discovery to you. The first aspect of the game that took me by surprise is the superb 8-bit chiptune music. The only problem with that is that it does get repetitive only because it replays one single track for about 30 minutes at a time, until you complete each level. The graphics are imitating the general style of the Commodore 64, including its startup screen. VVVVVV's main platforming mechanic is the player's ability to flip the character's screen position vertically, going from bottom to top and vice versa. This makes for some complicated platforming in general, as well as some challenging and entertaining rooms. Because of the game's incredible difficulty, the developers have cleverly implemented checkpoints liberally throughout the game world, which cuts down on rage and frustration. With that said, VVVVVV still manages to be extremely difficult, and you should expect to die hundreds of times, if not one thousand times by the time you complete the game. The platforming and controls are not badly designed, as in Super Meat Boy, so do not confuse this well crafted, yet simplistic game with that developmental disaster. Younger generations of gamers may find the overall presentation of VVVVVV to be unique and hip, but as we all know, these graphics have been done before, about 30 years ago. One serious flaw is that there are no audio options for volume. The in-game default is quite higher than usual, and requires turning down in Windows. While the majority of the levels' rooms are a lot of fun, and well designed, some are simply unreasonable and require too much luck as opposed to actual precision and skill. Because of this, you will die many times and spend far too long attempting single rooms. Which also means being forced to listen to a single song on a loop, for the entire duration of your trials. This is something of a shortcoming and should have been avoided completely by the developers, as these uncalled-for rooms only add negatively to the experience. Even though you get unlimited lives and unlimited continues, having to repeat a single room hundreds of times in order to pass it gets boring, repetitive, annoying, and only serves the purpose of replacing actual content with limited and mundane game play. While the music is once again, excellent, there are only a few that repeat over and over, as the rest must be unlocked by finding and collecting certain orbs within the game world. There are also a few more game modes for the player to experiment with once the campaign has been completed. The storyline and ending are endearing and delightful, and once you complete the game, there is an overall feeling of satisfaction. VVVVVV is short but perfectly sweet.VVVVVV is good.			"

												With a difficult game (and make no mistake, VVVVVV is a difficult game), a title needs both an amazing soundtrack and a ton of checkpoints to take the frustration out of the countless deaths the player is sure to endure. Thankfully, VVVVVV has both. Definitely worth a play and at $5 you just can't go wrong.			"

												Pros:- Easy gameplay- Good feel of the game- Great music- Wide range of obstacles, ranging from;""pfff, easy as♥♥♥♥♥♥"",to rage in a certain lvl for an hour without any noticable progress.Cons;- The dialouges and story ain't worth much, and you only really play it to get all the trinkets, to let people know that you defeated that one or two hard part that everyone is talking about.- The scenery is pretty much the same, even though some can argue that it is one of the charms about the game.- Get's a little repetitive after a while and you usually never play more than 30 min. at a time.6/10			"

												Это нечто хардкорное или непроходимое без матов, прикольный 8-ми битный саунд-трек. Нечто похожее можно наблюдать в Super Meat Boy, но если крепкие нервы, или вам с другом нечё делать и вы играете по смерти как в старые добрые времена на ""SEGA""  то самое оно, можно даже получить удовольствие) 8/10(НА ЛЮБИТЕЛЯ!)

												VVVVVV is a simple platformer released in 2010 which simplifies it's basics into one rule: what if you reverse gravity instead of jumping? This is an interesting rule used in this game and it impacts on how you play the game, too. No skill is required to play this game; you can simply pick up the game and discover things as you go through.So, VVVVVV is about Captain Viridian and his crew in space on the D.S.S Souleye, which then the flight to an unknown area has been interrupted, and the crew has to evacuate, however the evacuation goes wrong and Viridian is left on his own requiring him to save his crew members in Dimension VVVVVV. The plot seems interesting, however the only thing concerned is that the characters never mention the year, assuming it is in the future due to the teleport technology used. They do not also mention age, and gender, although colors and personality shape the genders of the characters.The difficulty of the game is similar to Super Meat Boy: the difficulty is simple on the first stages like the introduction level and onward from the Lab, it gets challenging.Overall, this game is good except the fact that if you don't like difficulty, please leave.I'd rate this game a 9/10. This game also has good music. BUY THE SOUNDTRACK!			"

												VVVVVV is a platformer at heart, but is it a platformer you will want to play ? You play as Captain Viridian whose spaceship gets caught in a space warp. The warp damages the ship and scatters the crew of the ship in space so its up to you to find them and rescue them. So how is this game ? Its a great platformer without a doubt. Youre Charecter controlls great and if you die its pretty much youre fault. The game style is sort of like those Metroidvania games. It has an open world enviroment and you can go where you want. Even though it might seem simple enough this game gets very complex on the later parts of the game. Youre charecter can choose where to walk on the ceilling or on the floor. Later levels get really hard and it might make you quit the game, but the game never gets so difficult that you will never finish it. The music is really awesome and its one of the best soundtracks out there. The only major flaw is that this game is pretty short almost under 2 hours. Overall a really good game that if by the time youre reading this review havent played it, check it out right now great music, awesome enviroments and collectibels throught the game you can find to increase the games lenght. I give VVVVVV a 8/10			"

												Lovely retro graphics, great soundtrack, hard puzzles but still not too tough because it autosaves constantly, good controls, good simple story and I surprisingly ended up empathizing with the characters even though they all look virtually identical and don't talk much.Gender-wise 2/5 of the characters are female and the player character's gender is unknown, so that's above average, and they don't have ribbons or such oversimplified gender signifiers. Great!			"

												This game is awesome from a retro-gamming perspective.  The gravity reversal mechanics add something to the game play  that makes it really fun to play despite the simplistic graphics.  I feel like I'm playing berzerk but on a better platform with a twist.  The game is hard and rewarding.  You feel achievement when completing a checkpoint.  When you make a mistake, it is usually because you forgot to orient yourself to the reversed mechanic in order to get past a set of obstacles.  It's addicting and challenges the mind.   I saw Mike Matei live stream this game a couple days ago.  It was so interesting to watch, I had to give it try.EDIT:One bad thing I noticed is that the character walking is slippery and inconsistent.  Sometimes a slight press in a direction bursts him into a full run often hitting spikes.  Other times his movements barely register leading to death in some other way.  Sometimes the character has momentum, and sometimes he does not.  I never understood why game devs release games like that, but overall the rest of the game is stable.			"

												This game is one of those faux hard games where it is generally the fact that you can't see what is coming in the next room that kills you, not interesting AI or challenging puzzles. I persoanlly do not appreciate these types of games, but I do understand there is an audience for them. If you are into speed runs and that sort of thing, then this might be for you. I do not beleive this applies to most people though.The actual exploration of the world was really cool though, I always love Metroid style exploration. I beleive that it was done well, with the map being quite interesting, and each section having some really unique bits and pieces to seperate it from other parts of the world.The last thing worth mentioing is that it is incrediby short if you are just trying to finish the ""main story"". I'm not the best at these games, but the 1.8 hours is all it took. No doubt the time trials will make up for this for people willing to go through some severe frustration.			"

												This game has a great concept, challenging puzzles and levels, and a cute storyline, but is let down by the slippery controls. People have complained about this issue, but the dev refuses to fix the inertia saying that ""it's important to the feel of the game"". I guess it's OK for the casual player, but when there's an achievement for completing the game deathless, and I'm the kind of guy who will aim for this achievement, the inertia makes what should be a fun challenge into rage-quit difficulty. 6/10, not recommended for 100% completionists like myself.

												TL:DR I don't recommend this game unless you like punishingly hard platforming and don't my sloppy controls.This interesting game that started out as intriguing and engaging quickly turned into an exercise of frustration and anger. Dexterity challenges and puzzles became mean spirited and unenjoyably difficult. I found myself cursing the game on many occasion ""♥♥♥♥♥♥this game!"" I only finished it because I knew that my friend had and that it is mercifully short. Overall I'm pretty disappointed in the overall experience of this game and wouldn't recommend it. The Good:Open world to explore. I really dug this aspect of the game. Even though it is a fairly small world it makes the whole game feel more cohesive.Some really great mechanics and level design. Fun challengesThe Bad:Shoddy controls. Half the time I died was because the character wouldn't stop when I wanted or go as far as I needed it to when commanded.Lame graphics. The 4 bit art style itself was not offensive to me. I thought it kinda charming. It was the ""enemies"", obstacles, and ""glitchy"" elements of the game that just were just plain lame or ugly.The music, which was pretty catchy at first, overtime became annoying due to how much it repeats as you replay a section over and over again.The Ugly:Level design that just feels mean. I seriously felt like the designers were laughing at me as I struggled to overcome some of the ridiculous sections of the game. The frequency of some of the check points are an indicator of just how difficult some parts of the game are.			"

												VVVVVV is a 2D platformer that revolves around gathering all the crew members after an emergency in their spacecraft.PROS:+ Very challenging+ Simple but unique gameplay+ Takes very little space and performance+ Nice music+ Fair priceCONS: - Can get very frustrating only in a short time- Which leads to the second point that whilst playing this game you don't feel any urge to beat a level or continue playing it. It's not satisfying- Not so very well-timed save stations- Most of the stages are quite similar in terms of hazards (99.9% of the enemies are spikes)- Gets repetitive really fastOveral, it's hard to keep playing this game not against your will, as it can deliver the opposite desired effect of gaming: frustration. Wishing you'd rather play something else is never a good sign. The game isn't the worst, but it could have been better.My rating: 5/10			"

												Really obnoxious gameplay.The problem solving could be fun, but the way that the screen constantly and suddenly changes makes some traps impossible to dodge the first time and/or artificially harder for no good reason, and it's irritating having to shift my sight up and down, left and right so often; it's a game that actually harms me physically.  This gameplay mechanic is not a good idea, but I'd give it credit for trying this oddity...It doesn't help as well that the controls are either unbearably stiff or oddly sensitive.Its one saving grace would be that, while not easy at times, it can be beaten quickly enough, so my eyes didn't had time to bleed.

												Ok so yes this has ""some""cool level design, but overall it is lacking in the concept of hard gameplay. It would have seemed that this would have a ""good plot"" and ""some good core gameplay"" but it just didn't. So, as much as I enjoyed playing it, I can't recommend it. 5/10			"

												VVVVV is simple yet great indie game that will test your skills (and nerves). Awesome 8bit fast paced music will keep you going even if you fail 1000 times. Overall - must have!WHY SHOULD YOU PLAY:- fast paced gameplay and smooth controls - really well paced music fitting the game- traps which will test your skills where you will achieve great satisfication when overcoming them- replay value (collectables...)- good example that even oldschool graphics can still make an amazing gameTHINGS YOU MAY NOT LIKE:- it's hard, you will die a lot so you will need a lot of nerves - graphics may turn off some people			"

												Lot of people love this game, but its not for me.Pros:>Good Music>Graphics although simple are charming>Flip Mechanic is unique and interesting>Free Roam(sort of) mapCons:>Blind sided by obstacles in next room>Only completeably through trial and error>Even when you know whats coming room changes make consistent movement difficult>With the way the game handles room changes, the captain can be seen at the edge of the room where he exited for a very brief moment when the room change lines up with a frame render.(Maybe I'm just crazy and seeing things.)>Trial and error based gameplay>Controls don't seem as responsive as other platformers I have played.I didn't hate the game, but after I while on veni vidi vici, I had a headache from all the room changes and had to stop.

												*I RECOMMEND GETTING IT WHEN ON SALE - I BOUGHT IT FOR ABOUT A BUCK WHICH IS WORTH IT*          VVVVVV is a retro style platformer with a great Atari art scheme and very Mega Man-esque music and sound effects. The presentation of the game is on point, but I often felt the gameplay fell short in some aspects.     The game is esentially a platformer, with a gravity switch mechanic as opposed to a regular jump. You will be using your ability to jump to the ceiling (or to the floor) in order to traverse the world and many levels of the game. This transition from hub world to levels is fun and seemless, allowing you to get a grip of the game mechanics early, but soon you will be throwing that out the window.     Levels will consist very rarely oF your ability to time a gravity switch on the fly. Instead, as the game uses a board to board style, you will be doing plenty of 'leaps of faith' into traps you have little chance of seeing or reacting to. Levels are designed in such a way that force you to use trial and error, which gives a false sense of difficulty.     Aside from leaps of faith, the game has a frustrating amount of timing sequences that rarely use the gravity switch feature. Your ability to dodge things left and right will be tested often, which isn't helped by the imprecise movement in the game. Even if the game controlled better, I felt as though I wasn't using the gravity swap enough in these situations. This is the equivalent of playing Portal, and solving puzzles with your aiming skills alone. If you aren't using the core mechanic of the game, I begin to wonder why it's even there.     VVVVVV prides itself on it's difficulty, which seems like salt in the wound when the game gets unfairly difficult. Levels/boards will have cheeky names and some of the acheivements ask for minimal amounts of deaths. I probably spent about an hour attempting to get the 'Doing things the hard way' Trinket which is the worst of all the 'trail and error/leap of faith' sections in the game. Asthetics alone can't really hold this game afloat despite my love for them. On sale this game is interesting and probably worth the money, but for $5, it's too frustrating and just not unique enough by most indie game standards.			"

												Got this in a humble bundle and was very excited because of it's popularity.It has ""stylistic"" poor graphics.  Distracting moving backgrounds.  An archaic save system so when I finally get to the teleporter and think I can go bed I get to deal with an escort quest.  This is a platformer, but the challenge comes from too many spikes.  Only play this if you like to be stressed while you game.			"

												I enjoyed this game up until I hit the point where you needed some serious Super Meat Boy skills in order to advance. I hit a wall quite suddenly and was never able to make it through. With no hope of advancing about halfway through the game, I finally had to give it up. Which is sad, because I enjoyed the overall aesthetic and the puzzle elements that came before perfect jumping and timing and the difficulty spike forced me to move on.			"

Personally, it gives me a sever case of rage quit, which is something to be avoided when gaming for fun. *			"

What I liked:  Soundtrack!!What You Need to Know:  I like puzzles or combat included with my platformers( or anything else to be honest)  I branched out to see if this game would change that, spoilers it didn't  If you love these platform only games that are simple, but hard to master you probably already have it. Otherwise this won't impress those who are curious or wanna try the genre out  Wasn't great for someone who isn't nostalgic to the genre ( didn't do enough to impress me)My Score:CPaid: Included in Humble BundleMain reason for dislike:Not a genre I enjoy ( this didn't' change my mind) Games that I think are better:   Shovel Knight  Axiom Verge  Cave Story+  Gunpoint "

												As this is not a review, just a recomendation(even though that's what steam is calling it, it isn't. The only option it has for a 'score' is a yes or no), I will say why I do not recomend this game. It's too hard. Thats it. No broken game mechanics, no bugs, just hard. If you are like me and get frusterated when you lose a lot, or dont find the satisfaction of winning worth losing (especially on this level) then don't get this game. If you like to speed run things and/or games like Mega Man, Super Hexagon, or Sonic the Hedgehog, and have a lot of pacience, get this game, but only if that is the only mechanic that you love about them. This game has one mechanic, which is switching gravity. No guns, no 'real' enemies (there are things shaped like enemies, but those are really only just fancy walls), no nothing. Barebones. It's not a bad game, and is honest about what it is. But if that isn't appealing, then don't get this game.			"

												This game was fun for a little bit. But I got bored of it long before I could finish. The game opened too much to keep track of places I need to go, and the map system wasn't helpful enough to be useful without my memory. So when I came back after a couple days of not playing, I couldn't remember what I needed to remember. And without as interesting of a game as say Metroid, I couldn't force myself to relearn.Also, I'm pretty sure I haven't put the 10+ hours into this game it says I have. Maybe I left on while I went to work or something.			"

												I bought this game on recommendation from a friend, and a vague memory of playing it before. Was it in flash-game format once upon a time? The music is glorious retro, and the loading screen will send you back to the days of the Spectrum ZX. Graphics are inevitably classic retro, the screenshots say it all.The gameplay, due to controls and level design, is very unpleasant for me. The concept is decent, with an interesting mechanic where you flip your own gravity to overcome obstacles, but the puzzle-platformer I was expecting is nowhere to be seen. It's an arcade-platformer through and through and if that's not what you're after then it's not the game for you. The left/right controls have a little acceleration, so movement where you need precision is sloppy and largely guesswork. If you play long enough you'll probably get it, but that's not the point - the controls should work for you, you shouldn't need to work around the controls.Level design is at times cruel and unfair, with a forced-speedrun section courtesy of a rising floor, and various traps that are only found through trial and error. For example, want to know what's in the screen to the left? There's a bump, so you need to jump, but you can't do that so you have to invert gravity, and there's no ceiling. Hope there aren't spikes in any of the 3-4 screens you have to fall through. Of course there are spikes. There are spikes in so many places (as there should be!) that it really makes the game mechanics work against you. There are the usual timing sections, but there certainly isn't a lot of leeway. You'll be dying a lot. And there's a slight delay on the respawn. Just long enough to wind you up as you retry a section (particularly the forced speedrun) over and over again.Lastly, the game mocks you. All the screens are individually named, and the developer has taken the time to use them to mock you. Not the endearing mockery as found in Portal, no, this will feel like genuine malice that in combination with the levels they refer to will give a good idea of the contempt the developer has for the player.I truly regret paying what little money I did for this game, as it has brought nothing but frustration. Incidentally if you want a game that hates you (and not in a good way, like Darkest Dungeon), this game is for you. No, my money would've been better spent donated to the developers of the (free) SHIFT.			"

												VVVVVV is a very simple platformer that runs with one simple idea. You can change gravity instead of jumping. Right into the review.This game is filled with frustrating design concepts that force you to replay the same situation over and over. Not to mention the sometimes-overly sensitive-sometimes not movement. One pixel hitting a spike? Dead. Pressed on the arrow key for a fraction of a second too long? You will go flying off the platform right into death. Most of the situations in the game aren't actually that hard. But they are just set up in such a way that you will fail over and over until you finally get lucky enough and you can fall down a pit pixel by exact pixel not hitting any spikes on the way down. It would be like trying to drop a quarter into a slot machine from 10 feet up. Its not challenging, just repititive and tedious. Its not enjoyable, its frustrating. This game is not imaginative. The concepts and level designs have all been done before. This game isn't revolutionary, its not Braid, and it is certaintly no Fez. The concept of changing gravity to move around the world has a lot of potential. But the designer was either a lazy designer or a bad puzzle maker. Instead of making a thoughtful puzzle game that requires much head scratching and brain storming. They went for a cheap ""avoid the red spikes"" route. The levels are all mapped out, sure there is an over world. But its laughable compared to what gamers in this day and age are used to. Avoid the spikes, run to the end, rescue the person. Boring.Now most of that I could live with. Its unimaginative sure, but at least it wasn't too frustrating. But the one thing that did it for me, the one thing that just killed the game for me, was the escort mission. Yeah you heard me, there is an escort mission. I can just imagine the developer sitting around thinking to himself. ""You know what this platformer needs? An escort mission. I bet the player would enjoy that."" Its completely surreal that anyone would even put an escort mission into a platformer. The NPC that you are escorting follows you from a couple feet behind you. So now, not only do you have to make it through the extremely accurate maze riddled with spikes, but you also have to guide this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ NPC through it as well. It got frustrating, fast.So, even though I love platformers and really wanted to like this game. I can't, I just can't. Don't get me wrong, its fun, for awhile. But then all the bad design choices just leap out at you as you play through the game. Honestly the quality of this game is something I would expect in a common flash game that I played online when I was in middle school. Now if I had recieved the game in that setting, I would have loved it. But that fact that someone is asking money for a game of this quality astounds me.			"

												This was a fairly fun game, that was pretty good for the price. It does hold some uniqueness in that you can reverse gravity instead of jumping, but gameplay becomes dull and monotonous after little time. It was fun, but, after a certain point, I was kinda making myself play, because I didn't want to think I wasted my money. After a little over 2 hours of gameplay, I stopped, and I don't plan to go back. This was pretty fun up to a point, and not bad for 5 bucks, but I would only recommend buying this game if there is a sale. Currently, there is a Christmas sale going on that makes this game $1.24, which is about right for the quality of this game.			"

No old platformers were nearly as hard as this and other recent similar titles (like super meat boy) so it must be some combination of purposefully making overly hard games coupled with cheapo graphics design.

												This game is overrated. The fact that VVVVVV perfectly recreates the arcades of 1980s or challenges the timing skills of players in the fashion similar to “Super Meat Boy” does not oblige anyone to burst into nostalgic tears and rate the game as an indisputable masterpiece. It is not for the lack of atmosphere that I do not recommend the game — old arcades often had an “excuse plot” and that was perfectly fine. It is not the difficulty — these games have nurtured generations of hardcore players that achieved robotic precision mastering the levels (compare “Mega Man”). The overall scale seems too small, the world is not detailed and diverse enough: even within that abstract and geometric style one could have created stupendous mazes with specific traits and unique atmosphere. Could have, but has not. Some suspicion that this game was hyped just because “indie developers must be supported” still lurks in my mind.Creating a game “à la eighties” to honour the timeless 8-bit æsthetics is such a responsible task, and one cannot just take the mechanics and the look of a different epoch and reproduce them using modern approach. Compare Jamestown — a perfect old-school shoot-'em-up game that is really indistinguishable from the 1990s shooters. It is so easy to trick anyone into thinking that it had been created 20 years ago because the look and feel are very convincing. On the contrary, you can’t plausibly think of “VVVVVV” as an 1980s game. With an aching heart I do post this review, without any hope to gain recognition or ingratiate myself with fans’ favour.			"

												Challenging, but in a frustrating way. A lot of the reason you make mistakes is because of dealing with the stupid acceleration they decided to place on the characters. It's possible to make challenging games that aren't frustrating (and thus, not as fun), but this isn't a good example of such a game. I don't like spending my limited free time being frustrated instead of having fun so if you're like me, I don't recommend this game.			"

												This is a painful platformer that is really simple to play. You can move left and right, but instead of jumping you reverse your own gravity. So instead of having your feet pointed toward the bottom, you push the space bar to have your feet pointed to the top and you float to the top. Its a great mechanic.The game consists of a small open world that lets you go anywhere you'd like all to rescue your crew members. The screen doesn't scroll. When you touch a side of the screen, it brings you to the next screen like Zelda. The game mostly feels like challenge rooms, dodging spikes. Hence the name VVVVVV. There are checkpoints everywhere, so when you get spiked, you'll always go back to the last checkpoint. Later in the game it makes use of the single screen mechanic where if you exit the left, you'll appear on the right side of the same screen. It is a distraction and several 'challenges' span more than one screen. The trippy moving backgrounds don't help either.The music is happy 8-Bit chip tunes. The simple art style is good, its just not that fun to play. There isn't just precision platforming, but diving down pits and precision platforming, shifting your character in mid air to avoid spikes.It can all be completed in 90 minutes or less. The game has a few extra modes like time trials and flip where the world is flipped. Its all extra challenge.If you're the type to enjoy a steep challenge where your only reward is more challenge, then this is the game for you. It has also been in a few bundles for a cheap price, so I'd recommend waiting for a bundle.			"

												Nice retro music and graphics, if that's your thing. But that's about all this game has going for itself. As for the difficulty, there is hard, then there is unfair. This game leans heavily toward the unfair side. ""Hard"" can be something like Super Meat Boy where you can plainly see all the challenges in front of you, and it's up to you to be skillful enough to pass them. VVVVVV's version of challenge is to punish players for not being psychic. It's trial-and-error gameplay at its worst. Your vision is limited to 1 tiny screen at a time. Get to the edge of the screen, and you appear in the next one. If you happen to be falling (up OR down, in this game) you go very fast and if there just happens to be a pit of spikes in your path, you die and there is little you can do other than remember they are there during your next attempt.

												Ever play Dark Souls? Remember how one wrong move could get you killed? This is Dark Souls as a platformer. That's not good. In fact, that's bad. Imagine Super Meat Boy without the tight controls. Imagine that one game that's really easy to compare every other game to. This game possesses some traits from that game, but not good ones.Also, a notable lack of replay value, given the fact that it's the same game when you play it again and there's no way to change the play. Every stage must be completed in the same way, no matter how many times you do it. Oh, there are parts where you have a ""choice."" That means you can go over or under the object in your way.It gets worse when you're trying to lead your comrades out of the hole they've gotten themselves in, because they, in the immense knowledge of the programmers, only move given certain criteria that you aren't told and have to discover through trial and error.All in all, it's a good game if you hate yourself and/or are interested in contemplating suicide.

												Reminiscent of early 80's arcade games, which should appeal to me. But frequent death is meaningless when you have unlimited lives.  You just hammer away at this very difficult game until completion.The music is fresh, but repetitive.Overall, I say take a pass, unless you're a ""difficulty"" junkie.WARNING - this game is written in Flash. At the time I write this (June 2011), flushing your browser cache will delete your saved files in this game! No joke, I lost my first hour and had to re-do. Check the Steam forums to see if this is fixed; if it's not, don't flush your browser cache until you've completed the game. (Fortunately, this game is brief.)			"

												VVVVVV is an extremely overated indie game that makes me wonder why this is one of those indie craze games. It feels like a it should be a mobile game. The gameplay overall is boring and repetitive. All you do is flip gravity over and over as the game teases you. The game is challeging to the point of being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I enjoy hard games but when a game decides to be hard and not be interesting at all, it's not fun. The soundtrack sucks (although I can understand why someone may like it) and it uses crappy DOS graphics which I guess a lot of games don't have but I couldn't care less. I would recomend super hexagon instead as it is a lot like it but much better.			"

The game almost immediately demands pricision jumping and movement with a loose, inaccurate, touchy control system. It only took me 10 minutes or so for the luster to wear off and everything about this game to start wearing on my nerves. It then only took another 4 minutes for me to stop giving a crap and deleted it from my inventory. Glad I got this for free.			"

												This is an interesting platformer with a simple concept: you cannot jump, but you can change your gravity alignment.First of all: I can not recommend this game.The graphics style is comforting and the music is great, but the gameplay and game itself is quite annoying. It took me about 2 hours and I were extremely happy that I finished it, but not because it was good, but because it was too annoying. The jumps you had to do were overall just too unfair at most times to be fun, the controls were just slightly too unresponsive to be fun to use in tight quarters. At one part, having to control an NPC by proximity was by far the most annoying thing I've had to do in a game this year. Dying around 200 times were about as much as I could take, where in contrast I've probably died around 3000 times in Super Meat Boy.If you want to play another platformer where the controls are tighter, music is good and you die a lot, I'd recommend Super Meat Boy.

												Platformer it is not. Indie games are cancer, cannot find a reason why they exist, the once great Steam was full of good games now is full with these bad games, more bad games than good, it's hard for some one to find the good ones among 95% of horrible Indies.Absolute trash.  If you want to constantly rage for lag in game and lag in controls play this non-game.Why do i need to play 2 characters the red guy is incredibly bad design, let me play, the guy kills himself without reason.Absolutely horrible design, can't finish the game after 2 h of almost constant death, there is no redeming value, no fun, very bad checkpoint system, useless, i cursed these people that made this.0/10 rating. Soooo many good games, why would anyone play these useless ones, not even for free, i got this garbage in a bundle probably because no one in their right mind would buy such things. "

												I'm going to say this straight up.  You need to have a lot of patience if you want to have any hope of beating this game.  This game is *hard.*Now that that's out of the way, on to the review.  The game, VVVVVV, is a hardcore platformer designed around the manipulation of gravity.  The controls are very simple:  left, right, and change the gravitational pull.  However, do not be fooled by its apparent simplicity.  This game, from beginning to end, is meant to challenge and frustrate, and only the most patient and skilled of players will be able to succeed.  There are various different ""levels"" connected by a hub world, with each level presenting a different mechanic, such as wires that instantly switch gravity to auto-scrolling levels, for the player to learn.  While the beginnings of these levels are meant to ease the player in, by the end of each section, the player will be required to have mastered the mechanic, if he or she wishes to succeed and move on.  This all culminates in a final level designed to test even the best of players.While a story is present, it's mainly just filler between levels, like many platformers.  However, in a game like this, I find one unnecessary, as that's not what the game is ultimately about.  I would even argue that too much story is present at times, as it can be a bit irritating to be forced to scroll through conversations to get to the next area.Finally, I must say that I love its music, a fast-paced ode to the older days of the NES and SNES.  It really fits the tone of the game and gets you pumped and ready for the challenges to come.Overall, this is a great game, and I fully recommend it to any who want to truly test their platforming skills.  This receives, from me, a 9/10.			"

												VVVVVV seems like it would be a waste of money and poorly made, one of my friends saw me playing it and asked why I would even pay money for it (for the amount of money most things are nowadays a $5 computer game is a good deal if it is as good as this)  well I have to say this game is a great game. I first saw this game when Tobuscus played some of it, I thought it looked stupid. A pixelated game that makes people mad, what could be worse (I had minecraft at that point nad never realized until now that minecraft is also pixelated and also makes A TON of people mad) This game is a good buy and the price is actually low for the quality of the game. No that does not mean make the price higher.			"

												This game is challenging but very fair. The mechanic of you flipping every time you jump is fantastic, and each level is meticulously designed with this mechanic in mind. My favorite levels are probably the ""endless scrolling"" type levels [think pacman or the first mario brothers (pre-SMB1) where you exit the screen at the left and enter at the right]. Really makes for some neat platforming that causes you to think a little bit diferently.   The timing can be quite tight at times, so this would probably be a good game for speed runners as it just feels great to really try and fly through the levels. There is a time attack mode for those who want to try and learn how to speed run the game.   The graphics are minimal but do the job, either way you're not playing this to be blown away by visuals anyway, as the game play is smart and addictive. The soundtrack is also littered with fantastic chip tune music.   If you want a platfromer with a well implemented gimmick, you should definitely pick this up. You won't regret it at any price point this game generally sells for.			"

												This game is not easy. There is a decent amount of depth to keep the story going and you freeroam instead of platforming through levels. For some reason, to me, it feels a lot like NES Mega Man series, only harder. You don't fight, or shoot, you just jump. Getting the timing right is the most challenge I've faced so far. If you want a platformer that is soley a platformer, and a very challenging one, then get this.			"

												This indie game is at the forefront of its genre, with its catchy music and interesting gameplay. The story is pretty good- you have to rescue your lost crewmates after a system meltdown on your ship. The best feature of this game would have to be the creative way of moving around. Along with walking left and right, you can also flip gravity to move onto the ceiling, opening up brand new level designs. The music in this game is something to be praised. Keeping up with its source material's title, the soundtrack is called ""PPPPPP"" since all of the tracks start with the letter, you guessed it, ""P."" Overall, I'd say this game is well worth its small price.VVVVVV: Intuituve indie platformer, with great aspects       9/10			"

												9/10This game is a fun return to classic action-platformers, where mental and physical reflexes make all the difference. The graphics are colorful without being headache-inducing, and the main mechanic of the game is simple to use but difficult to master. The backstory is engaging, and uncovered one piece at a time. The puzzles run the gamot from simple to brain-bending. Expect to die a lot on your first playthrough. Rooms that took you one try in one direction can take you fifteen tries going the other direction. My only complaint is that the story is relatively short, but this is assuaged by the multiple modes of play. Definitely something to play over and over!			"

												Addictive to the extreme, it's a bit commodore-like in appearance but plays so smooth. The music is so amazing it stands by itself as an album, and while difficult, it's forgiving enough that it can be beat, with persistence.All in all an excellent game.			"

												Though you'll be punished a lot… though you'll be frustrated at times… though you will find yourself quitting occasionally.. you will be forgiving. VVVVVV brings a very simple yet captivating retro platformer with a great coherence between music and visuals. What story there is in the game is really great. You’ll immediately be thrown into the core gameplay without having to go through endless numbers of boring tutorials. For once also a game I found challenging instead of something you just ""walk over"". Some areas might seem impossible at first, but once your mind starts to grasp the gravity flipping mechanic you’ll be set on collecting all the trinkets. Checkpoints in each area make sure that you never feel you really loosing any progress.			"

												In all respect the game was fun while it lasted, I just don't think it's for me. I bought it when it was .50 cents - and it was worth the .50 cents. I just don't suggest getting this game for $5 when you could get something better. If you're one of those people who like old 2D games/pixely games then this is for you. I'm not saying I don't like 2D/Pixel games because I loved the frist Duke-Nukems and Duke-Nukem 3D. Also, I don't think you can turn down the volume unless you turn down your computer volume down. Don't play this if you're talking with friends because it just silences them out and you can't hear them. Go ahead and buy this if you're one of the people who enjoy this kind of stuff! Didn't play through the whole thing; don't think I will.Game itself I will rate is: 6/10			"

												This is a pretty amazing game. It features but three buttons, really: Left, Right, and Flip. Left and Right do what they say, and ""flip"" inverts gravity.From there, it extrapolates an nice story (which indeed feels like it isn't a last-ditch plot to get you places), and very challenging gameplay. It isn't very large (once you do everything, there isn't a ton of replay value or anything), but it's big enough to satisfy, especially for the 40 cents I paid (thank you sale). Wouldn't have gotten it if that sale didn't happen, and I'm happy to have played it.The one point against it is this is the type of game where you die. A lot. Even after finishing the story (still got two coins to collect, but those two might be difficult), I died multiple times in the starting rooms. This game has spikes, and lots of them. So, if you're going to enjoy this game, you'll have to not get bogged down by deaths. But besides that, it's a good game. I enjoyed. Wait for a sale if you wish, but playing this game is a good experience.			"

												A fun simple platformer.  Imagine Megaman but with a LOT of spikes!Control: B+  (Some of the movement you slide around  a bit too much causing your death)Graphics A+:  Retro...I like it.Sound:  A:  I enjoyed the music and sounds but had to mute it at times to focus on certain rooms in the game.Overall I give this game a A rating.  It's a fun platformer sometimes frustrating but very manageable.  I didn't like at times hitting a spike just BARELY the game would count it.  This game is picky!If you see it for $5 or less give it a shot.  I enjoyed it.If you liked games such as ""Thomas Was Alone"", give this game a try.  It's a bit harder than Thomas was but still very fun.  It's about 4 hours in length total.No achivements but not a huge deal to me.Now to play the extra levels.			"

												The game can get very frustratng at some points, but overall this game is one of the best Indie games I have ever played, you're getting so much for what you pay. It's got awesome music and the play style is very interesting. If you're into games where you're meant to die a lot- I would definitely get this game. It's so rewarding when you hit tough checkpoints and of course when you finally beat a level			"

Creative level design, challenging secrets, and a fantastic soundtrack. I don't really need to sing this game's praises with how well-known it is, but I can add fuel to the hype fire at the very least. Certainly pick up this if you're looking for a good 2D platformer.

												This is a small, but fun game made from geometric shapes. The sotry is that you are on a spaceship with a crew, and you get stuck in a parallel dimension, and your crew gets randomly teleported to different parts of the map. As the captain, you have to find your crew and get out and back to your own dimension. The main power that you have with which to navigate is the ability to basically change the direction of the force of gravity on your character, up and down. It can get challenging at times, but well worth playing.			"

												oh god yes. This is one of the best, hardest and most original platformers of all time. You cannot jump - instead, you reverse gravity and fall up. Sound simple, is simple. Is also fiendishly hard. The graphics will induce tears of nostalgia in anyone who ever had an 8-bit micro, and the soundtrack is absolutely brilliant - homage to the tradition of great chiptunes, while being great electronic music in and of itself. You must buy this game.  "

												This game is amazing!  I admit that I'm a sucker for retro-style games, but this one does it well.  It focuses on having an incredible game mechanic idea and uses it to its fullest extent.  Then it has bright graphics that really help fit the mood, despite its intended limitations, and the soundtrack is pure chip-tune awesomeness.  In fact, i would go so far as to say that the music made going through the game much more pleasantly.  This game is hard, but it's a kind of fair-hard that gives you tons of checkpoints, and the music only pushes you forward through the game.  Even when I was struggling with the infmaous Veni Vidi Vici, the soundtrack was so upbeat that I simply kept trying and trying until i got it.There is no reason to not at least try the demo, and if you play the demo more than twice, you have no excuse to not buy this game.  It's only $5, and that's when it's not on sale!  HIGHLY recommended.			"

												No school like the old school, or so they say. VVVVVV is a very simple 2D platformer with the caveat that, instead of jumping, you have the ability to reverse gravity. While this may sound trivial, playing through just a few rooms will tell you all you need to know: this game intends to be hard. Thankfully, there are a ton of builtin ""save states"" scattered all over, but nevertheless, be prepared for some frustration - and hopefully some fun too!It is a very short game, but there is an undeniable charm to it, and the graphics and audio are very well done for the style of game VVVVVV is. If you ever find yourself wanting a challenge and some nostalgia for older days of gaming, I would recommend giving this one a try. "

But then I learned it was made by Terry Cavanagh - whose Super Hexagon proves that with perfectly polished gameplay, hard but fair difficulty, and a pumping soundtrack; neon shapes on a trippy black background are all you need for gaming bliss. Before long I was spending over an hour on a single puzzle, trying and (fairly) dying over and over again, all the while the glorious space-Guile's theme urging me to keep going, never to give up; and loving every minute of it.All to be able to say, with fists in the air: VENI VIDI VICI!!!

												Ah VVVVVV.  What can be said about this indie hit that hasn’t already been said?  Well, I could say its a hamster served with gravy, a side of steak fries, and an ice cold cola.  Of course that would be a lie, but it probably hasn’t been said before.This game is centered around one simple concept: You can't jump.  Instead you reverse gravity to get from point A to point B.  The goal is to find your five crew members and get them all, along with yourself, back to the ship.  While it lets you tackle some of the puzzles in the order you want, in-between it throws required puzzles at you.  And let me tell you, those puzzles are hard.  And by those puzzles I mean all of them.The game has pretty tight controls, a good thing because many of the games puzzles rely on pulling off tight maneuvers mid-air and landing on relatively small platforms.  That being said, sometimes I did find myself slipping off of various platforms or that I continue moving when I wanted to stop.  This may have been my accidental holding of the button, or may have been momentum actually being slightly carried, I’m not sure.  The music is good, and defiantly fits into the game.  Though it is weird how sometimes it fades out, as if to start the loop again, then picks right back up and keeps going.This is also a relatively short game and it's minimalistic on the graphics.  This brings me to my biggest complaint about the game: It felt like a Flash game.  In a world with free games available on sites such as Kongregate and Armor Games, it's hard to make an argument for buying a game when it looks like it could be played in a web browser.   Of course, the line between Flash, Mobile, and low end PC games is beginning to blur.However, this game is defiantly worth the money.  At around $5 the game delivers, and despite feeling minimalist and Flash game-y, doesn’t make you feel like you got ripped off.Overall, I give it a 9/10.  I have to dock a point for the loss of my sanity somewhere in the dimensions of the game.  Really, this game will steal your sanity.  I mean, I opened this review talking about serving hamster.  Regardless, this game is worth playing.Oh yea, and it's especially definitely worth it when you can get it for less than $0.50 and the money all came from selling trading cards on the Steam marketplace.  Don't you LOVE Steam sales, I know I do!			"

												This is a metroidvania'ish type of game with you go left and right, and one button to reverse gravity and back while avoiding spikes and such. Though it can be challenging with it's difficulty curve.Very challenging game, and has custom levels you can play and build.			"

												A quirky little platformer that asks, ""what if, in lieu of jumping, you could reverse gravity at will?"", this game is hugely fun. The sense of exploration and the varied puzzles keep you entertained from beginning to end, with some optional trinkets that add a LOT of extra challenge. The best parts would be the retro-style bit graphics and the AWESOME music score. The game is pretty short (my first playthrough took under three hours), but there's some replayability with time trials and challenges.			"

												One of the best games ever. VVVVVV is a platformer with it's easy parts and nigh-impossible parts.The thing that sets it apart from other platformers we know is that you don't jump, not once. Instead, you flip gravity to travel through the well-crafted levels to collect your fellow crewmates, all the while getting trinkets if you desire to.The game has rewards for completionists, speedrunners and average gamers alike, no matter how you play, there is a reward for you, waiting somewhere in the game.It is just truly seducing, even after a ragequit, it just seems to bring you back eventually to play again; try again.With an infinite number of lives, you surely can't get a game over......Actually, you can get a game over, with the game's ""No Death Mode"", one death and it is all over; right back to ""Welcome Aboard"", the first room.Overall, VVVVVV is a majestic game, just buy it now!Veni, Vidi, Vici.V/10			"

												Looking for a challenge?  VVVVVV is the retro-themed (think Commodore 64 style) puzzle platformer where you will die.  Repeatedly.  And you will be okay with it.  There are no lives; the challenge is getting through an area.  And it will be a challenge.  After you finish the game, there are a number of additional modes and item collections to keep you busy.  For $5, it's an excellent value.			"

												Imagine a platformer with no jump button. That game is VVVVVV, and it is amazing. I have never seen a better implementation of the type of deliberate insane difficulty platforming that somehow doesn't turn into table flips (yes, VVVVVV does it better than Super Meat Boy). On top of that, the retro visual and writing style is used to enhance the characters rather than just being for nostalgia, making it more charming than usual. On top of all that, the music is worth the price of the game.			"

												VVVVVV is a great game. It’s fun to play, looks good and you should go buy it now, so go buy it. Need more? Okay.VVVVVV is metroidvania puzzle platformer, well I guess it’s a platformer, you don’t actually jump, instead of jumping over spikes you flip, fall up, walk on the ceiling and flip to avoid spikes on the ceiling (and of course flip to go up or down). The goal of the game is to rescue the protagonists 5 crewmates, you rescue them by exploring the world, finding them and leading them to a teleporter. The game also has 20 collectable items called “shinny objects”, I don’t know what happens if you collect them all because there are two that I’ve never been able to get. It’s a very good game and go buy it!			"

												First of vvvvvv is long so im calling it v. V is an pretty original platformer you run around using a,d and using space to jump. I give these controls a 8/10. The mechanics are simple run jump but the one new thing is when you jump it changes your characters gravity with makes it a bit more diffacult i give these mechanics a 5/10. The graphics are just retro 3/10 they could have made them better. The story in this game makes no sense and is just a boring timewaster 3/10. The gameplay is over fun and theres many hard and easy lvls 7/10. Controls 8/10Mechanics 5/10Graphics 3/10Story 3/10Gameplay 7/10 Total:26/50 or 13/25 or pretty much a 5/10I think this game is overpriced i got it on sale for a good price $0.50 but $5.00 thats overpriced how about $3.00 like DLC Quest.

												Even though I've beaten this game I just can't bring myself to uninstall it. It's too awesome.VVVVVV is a puzzle platformer based on gravity reversal. Rather than treat this as a gimmick tacked onto an ordinary platform game, VVVVVV weaves this mechanic into every part of the game. About the only thing you can do other than walk left and right is reverse gravity, and you'll do this about a dozen times per screen, more depending on how often you die.Speaking of which, you'll die. Hundreds of times. Spikes adorn practically every surface in this game. Checkpoints are abundant and when you die you're back in the game immediately, so this isn't nearly as frustrating as it sounds.Speaking of sounds, the sounds and graphics in this game are a twell-executed throwback to the Commodore 64 era, and the chiptune-style soundtrack is as as catchy as anything on the NES. (I've been listening to ""Potential for Anything"" nearly every day for weeks now.)You want this game!			"

												VVVVVV is an interesting puzzle platformer that makes the player control timing of movement in order to traverse the obstacles and complete each zone. The game plays fairly well with the controls being simple but the use of momentum when controlling the character led to a lot of puzzle being more frustrating that they probably should be. The music is great and memorable, the Atari-esque pixel art style was enjoyable and the game overall was a satisying thing to play. My overall thoughts are that this game is worth at least $5 and I had a  great time to playing it. Pros- Music- Atari-esque Art- Interesting Platforming MechanicsCons- Floaty Movement/Momentum based movement.I'd rate this game an 8/10			"

												This game is for those who simply want to test their platformer skills. If you're the type of person who goes for challenges and you love sadistic platforming games such as Super Meat Boy, you'll definitely want this game. Most everything about this game is old-school, including the music; if you love chiptune music, you're in for a auditory feast. It's worth going through the game just for the music. This game is most definitely worth the five bucks it's going for - in fact, the five bucks understates the pure awesomeness of this game.In a nutshell, if you love difficult (punishing) old-school games, get this game.

												Wonderful little puzzle game.  Most of the skill is in working out how to do what you need to; it's often not immediately obvious, but responds well to trial and error.  Excellent decision to allow players plenty of respawn points to avoid puzzles that are only challenging because of their sheer length.  Oh, and you've got to have a tolerance for 80s music and aesthetics (which you should because they're great, okay?)Highly recommended, even if you're only mildly interested in puzzlers.			"

												This is a small, but fun game made from geometric shapes. The sotry is that you are on a spaceship with a crew, and you get stuck in a parallel dimension, and your crew gets randomly teleported to different parts of the map. As the captain, you have to find your crew and get out and back to your own dimension. The main power that you have with which to navigate is the ability to basically change the direction of the force of gravity on your character, up and down. It can get challenging at times, but well worth playing.			"

The simple gameplay and brilliant level design offers an enrgaing challenge that will have you yelling at your computer screen at times, and have you wondering how you manage to accomplish these insane meanuvers of timing and dexterity. The game also includes a level editor, time trial modes, community maps, and a good deal of exploration to keep you occupied for quite awhile. An excellent game on it's own, it alone makes it worth getting the indie bundle.			"

												I love this game. It has a nice twist where instead of jumping, your character's direction of gravity is flipped, which makes for great puzzles. The music is really good too. The game is styled to look like a Commodore 64 game, which is nice. I wouldn't recomend playing the game in fullscreen, though, as the game looks blurry then. Maximizing the window doesn't look blurry, though.UPDATE 9/7/11: Thanks to the game's new 2.0 update that rewrites everything from Flash to C++, the game can be played in fullscreen without looking blurry. However, you can no longer maximize th window, and you can only choose from 4 sizes of the window, rather than resize the box any way you like. However, it's still a great game and you should still play it.			"

												VVVVVV is the most fun I've had with any game in a long timeThis is an indie 2D platformer.Controls are simple, with just left, right, and a gravity-flip button replacing your jump.Music is amazing, with retro 8/16bit-esque songs so good, some of them made their way to Rock Band as DLC.Graphics are bacic, but charming and colorful, getting the job done.Level design is brillian, throwing unique twists into each section of the game.Exploration is fun with a map that fills in as you go to an area, with the flip feature making travel fast and easyTeleporters are activated as you go, for instant transport if you prefer.Collectable trinkets reward exploration, but never seem impossible to find.Playtime is short at 3-5 hours the first time, but easy to pick up and spend a day re-beating.Difficulty is hard, but other than a few optional collectables, never aggrivating.Bacicly, it's Super Meat Boy but shorter, more retro, and with 80% less rage.And its only 5$.Most fun game ever			"

												An awesome nonlinear platformer with a creative twist: instead of jumping, you press a key to toggle between falling up or down.  A tribute to the old Commodore-era games, it's got a wonderful visual style and an incredible chiptune soundtrack (seriously - buy it at www.souleye.se/pppppp - it's worth every penny).			"

												This game is simply fantastic.  The only functions are moving left-to-right and reversing your personal gravity to make it through the game's gauntlet of challenging puzzle rooms, and the likable characters and mind-blowing music are delicious, delicious icing on top of the addictive gameplay.  I've never seen a truer example of genius in simplicity - you owe it to yourself to try this game if you've even a passing interest in platformers.			"

												With a witty homepage URL (thelettervsixtim.es) and a low price of £4, VVVVVV bought my love with its retro charm and rewarding difficulty.Designed to resemble a Commodore 64 game, VVVVVV launches into a whimsically barebones plot about scientists scattered across ""Dimension VVVVVV"" when their teleporter malfunctions. The goal of rescuing the crew and escaping the dimension is quickly forgotten in the prescence of finely-tuned pixel-perfect platforming and a contender for ""Best Modern Chiptune Soundtrack"".The controls are simply 'Left', 'Right', and 'Flip Gravity', but this idea is explored in far more ways than you would expect, with the game constantly training you to understand new concepts without letting up on the difficulty. Checkpoints come just as frequently as death does.Secrets, Challenges and a Level Editor all add significant replay value, and the soundtrack {LINK REMOVED}(bit.ly/hEVe23) will probably haunt your MP3 player for a long time. Definitely worth your time and money.			"

												When I got this game, I was expecting a short, sidescrolling minigame with 8-bit music. Instead I got a very long, expansive full game with awesome 8-bit music. There is an actual storyline, and a good one at that, and the concept overall of not being able to jump, but rather flipping gravity upside down, works much better than one would think. The game revolves around fast-paced puzzles that you sometimes have to be able to solve at the slightest glance. And even if you know exactly how to solve a puzzle, the smallest miscaluclation in timing will send you flying into a wall of spikes. What I'm saying here is, it's extremely hard. But even so, this isn't the type of game that you can just get frustrated with and turn off. As your death count rises, you feel like you have to keep trying and trying until you get it.And even after you complete the game, there's the level editor that you can use to make your own custom stories and levels, and share them with friends. Overall a great game			"

												VVVVVV is a retro styled 2D platformer by Terry Cavanagh, creator of dozens of free games. You play as the fearless leader of a team of dimension exploring scientists who inadvertently crash, and are separated. The game involves exploring the strange world you've found yourself in, and reuniting your friends.VVVVVV explores one simple game mechanic: you cannot jump - instead, you reverse your own gravity at the press of a button. The game focuses on playing with this mechanic in a variety of interesting ways.The game is designed not to artificially gate your progress. In VVVVVV there are no locks, no power-ups, no switches, nothing to stop you progressing except the challenges themselves.			"

												More like ""FFFFFF"", because that's the sound you're going to be making. A lot. The graphics and music are charming and simplistic, but don't let that fool you. VVVVVV easily ranks as one of the hardest games ever made. There's only three things keeping you from imminent impalement: the left arrow key, the right arrow key, and the invert gravity button. There's no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t here: if you can't pass a certain room it's because you're not good enough. No puzzles, no keys, no boss fights and no weapons- just pure skill.			"

												Fantastically well-done indie game deserving of your attention. One of the most enjoyable compact experiences I have ever had with video games. VVVVVV was one of those games that I picked up and beat in one sitting, and considering how little time I have in my life now due to work, that is an amazing statement.The music is great, it has a story that works with the gimmicks that are presented, and the game is challenging, but not obnoxiously so.It often comes in bundles, and I've seen it dip to nearly nothing during sales. If you're itching to play a 2D sidescroller, I implore you to consider this one. You'll have a great time.Also, for the record, although I didn't go for 100%, I did the hardest challenge in the game, and it makes up the bulk of my playtime on this one. It's called ""Veni Vidi Vici,""check it out on Youtube if you're curious, and completing it was one of the most ridiculously satisfying things I've ever done in 20+ years of gaming. That's saying something serious right there.			"

												At first glance, this game appears to be a very simplistic platformer, but as you play through it, you'll realize it's quite complicated and well thought-out. The concept of vertical gravity swapping has been done before, but not in such a fast-paced, gimmicky, and expansive environment... or such a difficult one. I can only describe the main game's difficulty as ""medium +"". It should offer casual gamers a relatively pleasant challenge, and the game poses some optional, harder, sometimes ungodly difficult gameplay as well, for seasoned players.			"

												This is probably the most challenging platformer I've ever had the pleasure of playing and it is why I recommend it to the other poor souls who have steam AND reside in my friendlist.The challenges are clever, well placed and the game never takes itself too seriously. We could use more games of this quality and design in our steam libraries.Just stay away from stimulants while playing this game haha.			"

												I call a game that has replay value a game that I can actually stand to finish more than once in the same year. I am currently on my third playthrough of VVVVVV. Cavanagh has taken an  extremely simple game mechanic and wrapped dozens of complex, hard-as-hell puzzles around it. Combine that with an awesome C64 aesthetic and Souleye's rocking soundtrack, VVVVVV is a game you're going to WANT to buy nine times. So buy it nine times.			"

												A fun platform puzzler, like Braid, only with gravity as its twist instead of time.  Requires some pretty quick reflexes, but there are oodles of checkpoints so you can keep trying the puzzle room until you get it right. Fun characters, excellent soundtrack (if you're into chiptunes), it was highly gratifying when I finally beat it.			"

It's challenging in that frustrating, yet addictive way; when you die, you know it was your fault, and you know exactly how you messed up.3. The core mechanic of gravity-flipping sans jumping is used and varied in a variety of situations, making the most of it and exploring many patterns that follow as logical extensions to it.4. Who wouldn't want to play a game with a soundtrack like that?			"

VVVVVV embraces the retro style completely - not just with low-res graphics, but with its room layout, sound, music, color palette, fonts... even the complexity of the mechanics and amount of text on the screen is faithfully and charmingly reduced to what could be done on, say, an Atari 2600.  And unlike some platformers whose claim to fame is a twist to the normal movement or physics, flipping gravity was both novel and easy to get the hang of.			"

Exploring all of the game's varied and nonlinear levels will take you about three hours, assuming you don't try for the maddeningly difficult bonus collectibles. There are checkpoints scattered liberally through the game, and you'll need them; it doesn't pull its punches. Recovering from death is pretty seamless and keeps the gameplay flow going.			"

												If you want to sell folk on VVVVVV, you'll be staring up a hill with a near-right grade that's pestering you to climb it. For one, try to initially wedge mention of it into polite conversation; it's unpronouncable. Should you manage to settle on a verbal interpretation of the title eventually (""vee vee vee vee vee vee"", ""the letter 'V' six times"", ""vvvvhhh""), then you've got to sell anyone left remaining on the threadbare graphics and a difficulty that escalates like Wonka's Glass Elevator.It looks like VVVVVV is daring you to love it in the face of stark circumstances. You'll end up liking it, though; the music, speedy gravity-swapping play and psychedically basic visuals create an impressionable space-warping saga of authentic - and repeated - sacrifice. Captain Viridian is one of gaming's truest badasses, which goes a fair jog toward invoking the cliche of being deceived by appearances (much like the rest of this game does.)I did mention the music, right?

												I got VVVVVV with Humble Bundle 3. I had played the free version on Kongregate, and of the bundle's five games, this is the one I wanted to play most. It certainly did not disappoint.This game is a puzzle platformer with only three movement buttons: left, right, and reverse gravity. It does a very good job of exploring what can be done with just that. This game is, above all else, elegant. It's extremely elegant. The controls are simple, but you'll be doing all sorts of crazy tricks by the end.I beat the game in roughly two hours, but that's not saying the game is easy. It's short if completing the story is your goal. In those two hours, I died over 700 times. There are checkpoints between each challenge, so when you die, you can simply try again right away. Some challenges are very hard, especially if you play the extra modes. This game is as hard as you want it to be.I can easily recommend this one for $5. If you're not sure, try the flash version on Kongregate.			"

												First of vvvvvv is long so im calling it v. V is an pretty original platformer you run around using a,d and using space to jump. I give these controls a 8/10. The mechanics are simple run jump but the one new thing is when you jump it changes your characters gravity with makes it a bit more diffacult i give these mechanics a 5/10. The graphics are just retro 3/10 they could have made them better. The story in this game makes no sense and is just a boring timewaster 3/10. The gameplay is over fun and theres many hard and easy lvls 7/10. Controls 8/10Mechanics 5/10Graphics 3/10Story 3/10Gameplay 7/10 Total:26/50 or 13/25 or pretty much a 5/10I think this game is overpriced i got it on sale for a good price $0.50 but $5.00 thats overpriced how about $3.00 like DLC Quest.

												This game is pretty fun! I like its minimalistic style, in terms of both the gameplay and the graphics. There are really only two buttons you will ever need to use while playing, and just about any computer should be able to run this. It's simple, yet challenging and rewarding.It is definitely not without its problems -- sometimes the controls feel a tad slippery, and one would need a fair bit of clairvoyance to avoid falling into spikes when entering another room. However, infinite lives and abundant checkpoints prevent the latter from being too much of a problem.All in all, this game is definitely worth a try.			"

An 8 bit symphony that will keep you entertained for hours on end.The storyline is another great feature, while staying true to it's 8 bit theme, it focuses on a character named Veridian, running around a spaceship to save his lost crewmembers. The terminals also add a very interesting take on the story.VVVVVV easily changes the way 8bit 2-D games play.Overall would recommend this game, solid 9.5/10			"

												An absolutely awesome game.The game is a 2d platformer with retro visuals and music but don't let that turn you off. The gameplay is simple yet solid. Some would say easy to grasp difficult to master. A real challenge to play in terms of level design and mechanics but also very fair. Playing through it I never felt that it was the game asking too much, more just my skills being lacking. The soundtrack is awesome and accentuates the gameplay. My favorite moment in particular is when you get to a certain part and the floor starts going up with spikes underneath and the music just ramps up and you have to dodge spikes while avoiding the spiked floor, thrilling and very rewarding.10/10 I reccomend this to anyone to try out and at $5.50 what's there to lose? (or get it on sale at somepoint for basically nothing i guess if you're too cheap (or just economically minded?)) :)			"

												Oh my gosh i love this game sooo much!!! Exploration of an entire map that connects itself is really cool. Also posses a nice challenge for the first time playing the game. Im sure its great for speed running and i will try some of that too! And the music is soooooooo sooooo good man love that part. If you just wanna enjoy the game for what it is i beat it in 2.4 hours. 1 playthrough isnt really worth it but with alternate game modes and very challenging collectables the game is well worth 5 dollars. Speaking of witch its very cheap!10/10 would change gravity again!			"

												Veni, vidi, vici. This platforming game can be brutual and downright cruel at times. You WILL die. A lot. The game is somewhat short, although attempting to collect all of the shiny trinkets will extend that a bit. It is an amazing feeling when you finally get past that one room and reach the next checkpoint. Reccomended for people who love challgenes, platforming, and/or testing their patience.			"

												A simple plataform game with an outstanding soundtrack. It's really fun for casual players, trying to achieve all the trinkets can be a bit tricky but it's definitely worth. Then, for hardcore gamers, completing the time trials for achievements is somewhat difficult and require a lot of practice. Easily on my top 10 favourite games.			"

												VVVVVV is one of my favorite precision platformers to date. If you liked Super Meat Boy, They Bleed Pixels, or other challenging games, then VVVVVV is highly recommended. Although not the hardest or longest of games in the same genre, it stands out for its simplistic controls and the use of its gravity manipulation mechanic. VVVVVV has an excellent art style, which clearly pays tribute to the Commodore 64 era and has a fantastic soundtrack to match. Forced to point out its flaws, I would say that it is short (only 3-4 hours long) and comparatively easy, but for the price and for the quality of the game, I would say it is worth the buy.			"

												This indie game is at the forefront of its genre, with its catchy music and interesting gameplay. The story is pretty good- you have to rescue your lost crewmates after a system meltdown on your ship. The best feature of this game would have to be the creative way of moving around. Along with walking left and right, you can also flip gravity to move onto the ceiling, opening up brand new level designs. The music in this game is something to be praised. Keeping up with its source material's title, the soundtrack is called ""PPPPPP"" since all of the tracks start with the letter, you guessed it, ""P."" Overall, I'd say this game is well worth its small price.VVVVVV: Intuituve indie platformer, with great aspects       9/10			"
