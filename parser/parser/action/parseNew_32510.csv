												Great game! I love the new lightsaber moves, like throwing it, but am sad they took out the chain of lightsaber moves like in LEGO® Star Wars®: The Complete Saga. :( Those moves were awesome. But I like it and the hub is so big! The character creator still doesn't have an option for changing your character's animation, possibly choosing from any character's. (I really hope this will be a feature in future LEGO® games... The Hobbit?...) It would be a BIG part of customizing your character. (They should add more body pieces to the creators too...) The front texture on the chest piece is pasted on the back when using some chest pieces in creating your own character, (may happen using any chest piece, not sure) after playing as that character in a level. But this game is lots of fun, worth getting. :)			"

												I am really loving this game. I am a huge star Wars fan and I love Lego Games. This game actually feels more like a Star Wars game than another Lego title. The locations are taken out  from the show and  look very Star Wars like. The only things that look like Lego are the Ships and characters but in terms of background it looks more like a Star Wars game. I recommend you to play this with a pad. With the keyboard it can get really frustrating. The music and sound efects are really good so are the new animations. They look a lot better that the ones from the complete Saga. Even for the full price I feel I have made a great purchase. This game never goes on sale buts its worth it.I highly recommend this title if you love Star Wars			"

												I didn't enjoy this game when it came out. I tried out, and I didn't understand the battle mechanism, didn't understand the character switching, it was just so different from the LEGO® Star Wars™ - The Complete Saga.When this was on discount, I read all the reviews, I watched some gameplay footage, and I remembered how much I loved the Star Wars - Clone Wars series. And hell yes. This game is all about the series, the maps are the key episodes.And in my eyes the Clone Wars is not a cartoon, it is much more Star Wars than the sequel trilogy:when Ben Kenobi is talking to Luke about the great war, this is it! Yeah, Episode III also shows 1-2 battles, but this game IS the great war.The maps are following the events of the series, amd after learning the unique technique of the game, you will enjoy it as much as any other LEGO games. Win battle in the space, siege the enemy base in the ground, and finish the map as following the original Clone Wars story. 10/10 would buy again.Another LEGO game where I achieved 100%. Can't wait the LEGO Force Awakens.			"

												Lego Star Wars III - The Clone Wars follows the TV series: Star Wars - The Clone Wars. How well it does, I don't know, as I haven't regularly watched the show. It did, however, let me play through the very few parts of the show I remembered, so I'll have to leave how well it followed the show to the assumption that it does a decent job. As for the level design, there are plenty of good levels in this game, but are sadly overshadowed by the abundance of strategic open battlefield levels. You have to destroy enemy bases and build your own. It's fun and makes for a great side activity to be included (as it did in the game's Republic Assault missions) but it's also put in place of some of the actual story missions which just seems a bit lazy to me. The controls feel like the other Lego Star Wars games (I used a gamepad controller) but with what I would consider a major improvement. They removed the short combos from the previous games and replaced it with the ability to fight indefinitely. One thing I do miss, however, is the ability to use stronger lightsaber attacks by timing your next move instead of button mashing.Overall, I love this game but wouldn't give it a perfect score.			"

												Great Game! To let you know though, This game does not cover the end of the Clone Wars. It is only based on about 1/2 of the actual series seen on Cartoon Network. The game itself is amazing. The graphics are smooth and eays to see. The downside to this game is the price ponit. Not worth the money, wait for a sale on steam to get the game! I reocmmend this game to anyone who loves the Star Wars series.			"

												This game is a Lego game as we know them but its also a bit of a strategy game!They tried something different and implemented a sort-of-strategy mode where you build production buildings and take out the enemies base step by step. Its really great, as are the 'story' and the normal gameplay. Its just a very well made Lego game with a bit of a twist.Also it comes with a really big 'hub-world' aka. two spaceships, one clone-ship and one of the seperatists with tons of stuff to explore and riddles to be solved.I'd give it a 9/10 because it doesn't just do the story and is done with it like other Lego games did. Honestly this is a great game and you don't have to like the cartoon series to like this game.			"

												This game has a severe case of console-portitis. And the only cure is a controller.This game is good, but was ported from console to PC poorly, and although it runs smoothly, the controls suck. But if you use a controller, then the controls are just fine. Any controller will do really, but the prompts will be Xbox controller buttons. But that is not a huge issue. I use a PS3 controller using the Scarlet.Crush drivers. You could also use Motioninjoy, but the Scarlet.Crush drivers are better.So far, the levels have been good, they were not repeats of the same thing or anything like that.And I love the new RTS style levels.

												TL; DR – If you are in doubt which Lego Star Wars game to buy, buy The Clone Wars. It‘s shorter (18 vs 36 story levels) but vastly superior game.4 years later (2007 vs 2011) after Star Wars: The Complete Saga. TCW just destroys TCS and I don‘t even like that animated show (original short Clone Wars cartoon is IMO vastly superior series). Negatives:1) It has twice less levels (18 vs 36).2) It‘s animated series not movies (but honestly Ep I-III mostly suck, too).3) Flying/driving vehicles still sucks! Space battles are garbage because of it and I just outright ignored them.4) Lightsaber climbing is c.ap and I hated it. Good news it‘s very rare.Why is vastly superior game?1) Graphics is obviously superior but it‘s logical step after 4 years.2) Co-op AI is still useless but at least you won‘t constantly die from blasters‘ madness. In almost all levels you can achieve True Jedi in Story mode.3) Massive ground battles are cool concept. Sometimes a bit tediuos but mostly all right.4) You can skip videos!All in all, it‘s a above average game. If you are both Lego and Star Wars fan, buy it otherwise there are better Lego games.			"

												 A long time ago, in a galaxy of adorable little blocks...   Developer Traveller's Tales' LEGO games have never succeeded because they had the best puzzles or incredibly satisfying combat. In fact, in these regards, they were usually pretty mediocre. But they made up for the lack of awesome gameplay with adorable aesthetics and great use of the license. The latest, LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars, continues the trend, immediately grabbing fans like me with its smart use of the subject matter and cute visuals, and kept me engaged despite its issues with its large mix of simplistic gameplay elements. The final combination is just good, simple fun.  LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars covers seasons one and two of the popular animated series. Fans of the show get to act out their favorite moments (albeit as adorable LEGO characters), playing a variety of characters ranging from powerful Jedi to the lowliest droids. And like the other LEGO games, players have to use each character's unique abilities to overcome enemies and environmental puzzles. The puzzles and combat in LEGO Star Wars III aren't amazing. You might occasionally be surprised at a moment where a puzzle is genuinely clever, but they mostly either held my hand entirely or made the solution so obfuscated that they were frustrating rather than rewarding to solve. Likewise, the combat isn't all that exciting with its one-button-does-everything system. But, like so much of the LEGO games design, when you combine these two relatively unexciting portions together, something strange happens: It becomes a simple, engaging game. Maybe it's because together they break up the pacing and keep you in situations that are constantly forcing you to adapt, or perhaps it's because they're so easy to understand that you can kind of zone out and lose yourself to what's going on on-screen. Either way, I became lost to the grind of the adventure. And I enjoyed it. I would give it a 4.5 out of 10  "

												,It's a fun game. If you like the LEGO games already, you'll enjoy this a lot. Way more fun that LEGO Star Wars The Complete Saga, mostly due to an increase in variety, particularly in terms of the Jedi character's fighting styles and abilities. Only draw back is it's short, three storylines of six levels with four additional ones as opposed to the 6 sets of 6 in TCS. 30-40 hours to reach 100% completion and after that point you'll likely lose interest. Probably best to buy when on sale.Also fun to play local co-op if you have a friend or sibling to do so with.If you don't own a controller, don't buy. Very hard to play with just the keyboard.			"

												LEGO Star Wars III: Clone Wars was the first LEGO game where I often gut stuck for not easily understanding what I was supposed to do next. Once I had a bug where a level couldn't be finished and I had to restart it, and I had the game crash a few times. Additionally we see weak design carried over from older LEGO games. Besides those problems this is still a LEGO game and you can expect about the same amount of fun offered by previous LEGO games. Plus, there are a few new though very lightly implemented features which I enjoyed, e.g. the pseudo RTS ground battles and sort-of capture-the-flag space fights.+ Destroy and rebuild+ Pseudo-RTS elements+ Star system battles0 Hide-and-seek missions0 Still vanishing rewards but with acceptable time-outs- Studs falling behind walls- A few crashes- Buggy levels- No drop-shadows for coins, collectibles or characters- Bad information density on overviews/menus- Targeting of friendlies- Uneasy access to unlocked characters- Some confusing indicatorsWhen referring to old weak design I mean problems like missing drop-shadows making it hard (for me) to get a clear idea of the positions of game elements - vehicles of all sorts have drop-shadows though. Menus and most screens that could easily display relevant information that information is hidden in sub-menus or altogether denied, e.g. the pause screen during missions should always display the level name.There is a star map where each star has five data points, i.e. name, controlling faction and three completion states, only the first of which are available on the star map right away while the other three are hidden in each star's sub-menu. Admittedly they make sense in the sub-menus but should also be available outside.The hide-and-seek missions are okay. Basically, they are nice as a new idea and manage to avoid becoming boring by virtue of being pretty short.I like that collecting studs is easier here. Where in earlier LEGO games fighting often kept you from getting to your hard-earned studs in time, now you seem to have more time. Studs still fall behind walls or into the abyss though.Newer LEGO games offer direct access to unlocked characters at least in free play. This game has you run to sparsely distributed consoles, get the character you need to progress a puzzle, then run back to get the next character to solve it.Another old ""feature"" is the targeting of friendlies. I guess it's funny enough to punish your co-player from time to time but the concept makes absolutely no sense in single player mode. It feels almost as if the auto-aim - which in principle I agree is a sensible feature - prefers to aim at your sidekick rather than enemies or other sensible targets. This feeling may be due to my growing frustration with the effect and also the short distance your player 2 unnecessarily keeps.As usual you'll be able to obtain indicators that help you find red bricks and minikits. But sometimes the indication is pretty far off, indicating where you find the minikit rather than where you need to get it.Despite all the problems I still immensely enjoyed playing LEGO Star Wars III: Clone Wars and I recommend it without hesitation. If you had fun with other, specifically older LEGO games you should be sufficiently entertained by this one.			"

												It's as great as I remember it. It has an interesting RTS-ish system where you can contruct buildings and order troops while still retaining the first-person perspective. Wonderful story that follows the Star Wars: The Clone Wars animated series quite well up to season three.			"

												Lego Star Wars 3 is the black sheep in the series. It seems like Traveller's Tales wanted to experiment a bit with this one. Many levels feel like Battlefront space battles (you get on and off your ship repeatedly), some levels are a simplified RTS game, the Hub is huge and expands as you explore it with new abilities... And that's not counting some new gameplay mechanics, such as the lightsaber throw. You would think that with that many new features, it would be the most awesome game in the series. The thing is, it's not. The ""Battlefront space battles"" are quite amazing, but other than that everything feels off. The RTS parts are fun at first, but it feels quickly repetitive and not very clever (there are a too many levels like that to my taste). The Hub is just too big, and looking for a character you need to progress in it is a pain and can take a lot of time. Also, it's not always clear where you have to go or what you have to do. It's supposed to be a children game, but I often found myself stuck for a while. Walking in circles trying to find the next objective is really tedious and should not be a part of this game.But the worst of all is that TT found a way to mess up with the coop part. Coop multiplayer is arguably the biggest selling point of the Lego games; ask anyone who love their game, and there's a big chance they'll tell you they love playing them with their partner, their friend or their kid. But in Lego Star Wars 3, their are phases where the two players are not even in the same room, and they have to do different tasks. It doesn't feel like they're playing together. And above that, one of the two players will often have less things to do than the other, so it's just a dull phase when they do nothing and have to wait for the other. Why do I still recommend it, you ask? Well first thing, I'm sure that if you play it alone, it's a much better game. If so, I'm sure it's amazing. But even if you play with someone else like I did, the ""classic"" phases are as fun as ever (when you're not seperated, that is), the RTS ones are at least nice to discover, and in the case of the space battles they're quite fun the whole game. Also, the humor is enjoyable. It's not as great as the humor in Complete Saga, and some of the jokes are a bit too random, but it's good and certainly better than what you have in some of the most recent voiced games (looking at you, Lego Marvel).

												I played countless hours on Indiana Jones, Batman and various Star Wars LEGO games throughout my childhood, and this one is by far my favorite. Pros:- Multiplayer now has a versatile split-screen feature so players can move independently- Hub is enormous and fun to play in- Levels are full of challenging puzzles and content that you'll need to come back later to fully explore- A wealth of unique characters- Humorous ""dialogue"" and scenes (one of the last voiceless lego games)- Spawns more enemies but runs wellCons:- If you don't want to play multiplayer on the same keyboard, you'll have to find a USB and plug in a controller (at least, if you want to play with an Xbox 360 or Xbox One controller)- Controls are really odd if you're playing a Lego game on PC for the first time- Can be hard to hit with blasters on a keyboardOverall I would greatly recommend this game, esp. on sale "

												Going to make this one short, seeming that I haven't finished the game, but I couldn't get into this one. I love Star Wars and the original Lego Star Wars is great, but this one felt extremely bland. There's some great additions like better combat, insanely awesome graphics, and massive battles. Unfortunately, everything else is just a run-of-the-mill Lego game. If you like Lego or Star Wars, it's okay, but not the best out of the series.			"

												The Lego games will always hold a very dear place in my heart. I love them. For me, they are my ""relaxer"" games.So it is without hesitation that I recommend Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars to any and all Lego fans and Star Wars fans, as well as fans of goofy, exciting fun that isn't too much of a challenge.Pros:- Fun, colorful graphics.- Loads of entertainment for anyone of any age.- Hours and hours and hours of playability and replayability.- Legitimately funny cutscenes and Lego antics.- A HUGE central hub.- A huge number of characters to unlock and play around with.- As best I could tell (based mainly upon the fact that I am not quite caught up with TCW television series at the time of writing this review), the missions are faithful to the series.Cons:- Literally the worst Lego character creator I have seen yet. I LOVE to make my own characters in the Lego games and roleplay through the levels with them. I was, however, unable to create a cunning, bad-to-the-bone, bounty hunter or Magna Guard-turned-Dark Jedi to my liking. Shame on you, Tt Games, shame on you.- Occasionally the graphics would hit a weird hitch where, during the cutscenes, the characters would be invisible.But, despite these (very few) failings, I would absolutely, positively recommend this game. But do yourself a favor and get it on sale, like I did. The price is a tad steep for a game from 2011.Cheers.			"

												The fourth game in the lego star wars series, Lego star wars 3 is a special one since it's about the Clone Wars cartoon instead of the movies. I wish this game was made a little bit later but not too late since some of the cooler episodes were not out yet when the game was made, but i also like that they still have grunts and moans instead of voice acting.what is new in this game?You choose what missions you want to start with instead of going on a linear path. you play episode to episode. The best part about it is that it's in actual chronological order! yes you heard that. the game actually follows the story in chronological order unlike the show which released the episodes in a random order!There are more features such as gold bricks that have to be destroyed with rapid fire weapons, throwable lightsabers, combo moves, quick time events, and more. i'll talk about the biggest ones next.There is now a bigger hub ship with tons of rooms to unlock and secrets to be discovered. Once you open up the hangar you can actually take a ship and fly to the seperatist ship and change hubs to the evil side where you can buy separatist characters and ships AND even play sith side missions!The other big mission features are ground battles where the game throws you into an empty and big level with areas to build bases and turrets. You attack and take over other bases by making troop barracks sort of like a RTS but you get to battle too. There are now more customizable characters than the usual 2 we saw in lego star wars 2 and complete saga. The music is taken from the episodes the missions take place in so no more do we have repeated tracks from the movies in every single enemy encounter, every episode has different music. Like i mentioned before the game is based on the show , but it's based on the first seasons. The clones are still in phase 2 so there are no episode 3 ships or clone troopers like we see later in the show. OVERALL is this game better than 2? in features and gameplay yes! but for those people who never bothered to watch The clone wars cartoon they might not like the setting. the humor is still here! the cutscenes are longer then before and    even a little bit better. the characters now have more face expersions which give them more personality.another thing that will make you enjoy the game is the lack of the pointless voice acting that started with lego batman 2. The silence of the characters make it funnier and their own style. Graphics are more shiny than before and the characters more detailed. GET THIS GAME IF YOU ARE A FAN.!! my rating would be a 9/10			"

It really gets the funny sense of lego humor and combine it with Star Wars: The Clone Wars. It fits perfectly. Good job Traveller's Tales. Another great lego game.			"

												The best game in the Lego Series period, a tremendous improvement over Complete Saga (another excellent Star Wars game worth checking out), sadly there's no online play. Which is a shame given that co-op is one of the best parts of the series.Lego Star Wars 3 does everything to immerse you within the Clone Wars, fight as a Republic Jedi or a Sepratist Sith, unlock characters from the Original Trilogy. Lego Star Wars 3 is definitely worth 20 bucks and will make you SMILE SMILE SMILE!			"

No Momento em que você quiser participar do Universo graças ao Episódio VII, PenseCompare nesse momento que se estenderá até 2020, de intenso Hype por tudo o que se relacionar a Star Wars, qual a diferença entre Battlefront e Lego Star Wars, falo aqui pelo Clone Wars e também pelo Complete Saga completado nos aureos tempos de PS2. Obviamente, um é FPS mal explicado e infimo por 120 reais, o outro é voltado a retratar a história das duas trilogias de forma bem humorada e divertida, pra qualquer idade, com muito mais detalhes, por apenas 11 reais.Há a necessidade de mais explicação? Não há, na minha opinião, melhor jogo de Star Wars a não ser os Battlefronts originais, não há!Mais e os gráficos?Sensácionais, dentro dos limites de um jogo Lego, é claro, mas caso você tenha jogado apenas as versões de PS2, vai achar que é um jogo de 2015!

												This lego star wars is my favorite of all of the lego star wars games out to this date and it makes remember so of my favorite time watch the star wars the clone wars tv show which was ended far to short. It game covers some of the best and most action packed episode in the series which includes a level strait from the first episode of the series to side quest as cad bane and other bounty hunter. It even had a level just made for the zillo beast.This is why I must as for legos to stop wasting it's time with the force awakes and make star wars the clone wars 2. This could include even more action and even bigger battles like the umbara campaign or follow clone captain gregor. A add thing legos could do would be to make the lost episodes (episode that never got finished or started on) in to level.So yes I would recommend this game			"

LEGO® Star Wars™ III: The Clone Wars™Pros:- Great animations- Gameplay itself is great, the way some jedi or sith grab the lightsaber, and stealing lightsabers from others, etc.- The story is a summary what happened in the TV Show- Puzzles are tricky and fun- Arcade mode which lets you 1v1 with someone else locally- Cool and many bossesCons:- Less than 100 characters- Some bugs around there- Horrible controls on keyboard- Jar Jar Binks :PConclusionBuy it on sale, after you buy complete saga, the gameplay of this game is truly awesome, play it with a controller, it seems complete saga is still winning.

												Personally, even I don't know why I'm giving this game a negative review. Maybe I'm just spoiled on what Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga already delivered...Naaaaaah!Lego Star Wars III- The Clone Wars is the next game Traveler's Tales was contractually obligated to make from Star Wars, before they'd lose the rights, which I'm sure they're refreshing with their new release for The Force Awakens. And, as always, there's a problem with the Traveler's Tales Lego games that seems to have started with this entry...Traveler's Tales doesn't believe in patience. At all.Why wait for us to do a complete Indiana Jones, when we could release two? I know! Let's also release Lego The Hobbit within months of Battle of the Five Armies, but not include it in out game! Wait! I've got another idea! How about we make Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens, before the other two entries are even made!It's sad, honestly. I really like certain elements of LSW III that I do like. The new characters and locations inspired from the Clone Wars film and TV series are all fun to play as, beautifully animated, and great to control. There's tons of new abilities available, allowing tons of new opportunities for puzzles, such as mnigun targets, grappling, and precise Force movements.However, this feels like a really shoddy attempt to give these new abilities so light to shine in. There were a fair share of puzzles in the original LSW games that didn't outright tell you the answer, but you could figure them out with your own deduction skills. But with the way the puzzles are set up for the new abilities, it's always obvious what you have to do next.On top of that, if Traveler's Tales had waited for the ENTIRE series to finish its run, they would have had a lot more opportunities at their hands. Hundreds of characters, tons of new planets to choose from, and even more abilities you could create.But it really feels like they chose the most boring planets to visit. Out of all the levels I played, I only liked Ambush, Rookies, Lair of Grievous, Hostage Crisis, and Castle of Doom for their aesthetics. 5 out of about 25 levels. Because most of them are either space levels, running around dark, metal corridors, or battlefiels in the middle of a desert.Where's the snowy tundras of ""Trespass""? Where's the swamps of Rodia from ""Bombad Jedi""? The massive fungal world from ""Bounty Hunters""? It doesn't feel like TT chose the most creative or unique planets from the show to focus on. Along with that, I'm not the biggest fan of the massive battle levels. They might have been better in the match mode, but from the story mode, it's a very one-sided fight with some simple building mechanics, that would've worked better if you could select bases at once, instead of running to the base you want to build on, and then building there.However, I did enjoy the space levels for their new enhancements to the original level design set up in LSW II. Now, you don't just fly around and shoot down enemies, you also can fly into cruisers, and take out individual droids and solve puzzles as a normal character. It has the Battlefront II feel to it, that I enjoy.I also enjoy the new minikit feature, where they actually unlock different character to play as... but that leads into one of my biggest complains for the game... The Hub. It sucks. It absolutely sucks. It's far too large. Everything is spread too far apart, so it's a drudgery to get to another side of the ship to buy a new vehicle you unlocked. Or if you forgot a specific character to solve a puzzle, you'll have to find another character-selector and then return to solve the puzzle. I mean, hell, there's an entire space zone between the Republic and Separatist cruisers, if you want to go all the way to the other side of the Hub to unlock the villain characters. In layman's terms, this sh** is spread too far apart.And while I do like the new minikit feature to unlock character, I don't like the lack of creativity spent in hiding the minikits- especially in the battle levels. It gets so predictable, that it gets flat out boring to collect all the minikits, or frustrating if you make a small mistake, and suddenly a section of the level is blocked off and you'll have to reset (but you can save what progress you've made- which I do like).I'm giving Lego Star Wars III- The Clone wars a 5/10. It's a massive mixed bag filled with tons of new things I like a LOT... but a ton of other things that felt like Traveler's Tales was just going through the motions in making another Lego Star Wars game. It's not bad, per se, but it doesn't have enough good features to make it distinguishable from the rest of the Lego video game library.			"

												I used to play Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga all the time as a kid and I loved it. When I saw this game, I decided I would give it a try... once it went on sale. May the 4th sales finally came and I bought it. What a disappointment. The battles are not nearly as fun as the Complete Saga because they have replaced the lightsaber block with a lightsaber throw which means you are just mindlessly swinging a lightsaber instead of trying to deflect blasts. The battlefields are huge and monotonous to traverse (not to mention they have terrible camera angles.) The whole system of how you destroy blocks is extremely annoying: Only explosions work on silver. Only rapid fire units (which are rare and annoying to use) work on gold, and its not just blocks, but vehicles too. You spend most of you time trying to find a vehicle or weapon that will destroy the one target you need to capture a base. The whole ""squad system"" and the fact that you must coordinate multiple units to destroy one object is unnecessarily cumbersome in a game that should have simple play mechanics. My biggest gripe, however, is the fact that this game is WAY less intuitive in level design than its predecessors. I've encountered multiple scenarios in most of the missions (including the very first one) where I am completely lost and have no idea what the game wants me to do. This game is just not rewarding enough for me to even consider free play mode.On the plus side, there are numerous jokes and visual gags in the cut scenes typical of a LEGO game.			"

												I shouldn't have finished this game because I hated it. My brother who I co-oped the whole thing with hated it as well. We were actually sort of excited to play it too after working through the entirety of The Clone Wars show in November/December. I didn't think Lego games had changed too much over the years, but this game changed my stance on that. There were just so many awkward moments of level design that left my brother and me bewildered as to what the devs actually wanted us to do to progress forward. They also did this half♥♥♥♥♥RTS level experiment that is simultaneously dumbed down for the age-group of the target demographic and bit too complicated and irritating for that same age group. As an adult it's hard not to wonder what the hell they were thinking when they put those levels together. They also decided to dump them all into one of the level arcs too, leading to some bizarre pacing where we were stuck playing a bunch of them back to back (boy were tempted to co-op the delete button there). The game makes almost no effort to make good use of the source material- they skipped over a lot of episodes that had good potential and opted for some of the weakest ones. I do recommend checking out the show on Netflix though. It is the proper 2:35 presentation and has a lot of story arcs that are the some of the best Star Wars stories out there. Verdict: Hard pass.

												This Lego Game is nothing like the other one.Graphics wise it looks allot better perhaps then any of the Lego games.But it's very boring and allot of it is a battle which is something new, but it's boring and takes to long.All missions take far to long.Just not what I would have hoped it to be.After you finish the first 18missions, it's hard to even find all the other missions what a joke.Yeah let's make levels and make it hard to find it all.

Controls dont do what theyre mapped to do and gameplay is confusing. Dont waste your time, money, or patience with this♥♥♥♥♥♥game. Usually lego games are fun but i guess not this one.			"

												As a big fan of the LEGO games, it pains me to say that this is a bad game. While the characters feel much more realized compared to their LEGO Star Wars 1 and 2 counterparts, the game inherently fails in the gameplay front. Levels are really poorly designed with puzzles very obviously forced upon the player, as they make no sense in the context of not only the story, but the setting themselves. While I respect the fact that the game experiments with the wierd army/base levels, they eventually become driving into the enemy base with your mediocre vehicle to shoot down the turrets as no one attacks you. This failed experiment unfortunately makes up a third of the game. The hub is also an absolute travesty. Places are hard to reach and it is never clear where anything is. You can't even get a bounty hunter character until you make a spaceship and fly to a different base. I can go on and on about why this game isn't good, but to me it's clear that Traveller's Tales didn't really know what they were doing here.			"

												As a big fan of the original games, this game is a disappointment.  Although there's the trademark LEGO star wars parody humor, the rest of the game falls flat in terms of simple enjoyment.  They added some new features that make the game less enjoyable. For example, in the older games, a jedi could just stand and deflect incoming laser blasts. Now, he has to hold down a key to do it.  Also a terrible PC port. Instead of having a simple mouse-WASD keyboard interface you've got on 99% of pc games, it's keyboard only, and with poor logic.  Sometimes K is select, sometimes it's back, sometimes Space is forward, sometimes it's jump. The objectives are so obscure and counter-intutive, I find myself standing around trying to figure out some logic on how to proceed (while getting constantly shot at) or constantly searching through walkthroughs to get the answer (which usually leaves me saying: What were they thinking?)

												I don't like this game because it makes me feel like an idiot... I can figure out the freaken tombs in Tomb Raider, yet a game played by children makes me feel like I should hand back my college degree. You are dropped into a situation and you feel like Yoda is flipping you off because he tells you this character is needed which you don't have, but does he give you a hint on what to actually do? Nope.The fighting isn't really interesting, I didn't expect it to be but I would like to understand how I am getting hurt. I don't see how I'm getting hit, or really when. A noise to tell me that I got hit would go along way.The sad thing is, it's probably still better than battlefront.  "

												I love the Lego games and Lego Star Wars, but this.. just isn't a Lego game.I understand that when this came out people were saying how Lego games were getting stale, and so Travellers Tales decided to change up the gameplay, the problem is what they changed it too is a boring sub-RTS with some normal levels sprinkled in. I've only played 3 levels all of which were short and boring, if they had only made this game with similar but updated gameplay from the last 2 games, it would've been perfect. Note, that even if you love the cartoon, it's still not worth it, I recommend just getting the Complete Saga, an older but much better game then this.			"

												I'm genuinely confused by all the positive reviews for this game, because off the top of my head I can name several bad things.1. Unskippable cutscenes. (THAT ARE LONG)2. Poor controls (I'll go into deeper detail in a minute)3. Confusing missions.Being a fan of the original LEGO Star Wars series, I purchased this game in hopes it would be similar to the others, which it seemed to be at first, but naturally with a modern twist. I had no complaints up until I tried the first mission. The controls were completely different from the original game, which makes no sense I might add. They clearly went about this in an attempt to recreate the old game, but they messed with the controls that had existed in the earlier version.ONE LAST THING: This game is clearly directed torwards children, unlike the old game. You can tell by how shiny and ""cute"" everything is. It's too bad they didn't just recreate the old game with new parts, so to speak.			"

LIMITED. it's ridiculously short, about 25% of the content of the series. this could have been great, but the producers chose this a demo-lenght game... and the ""dialog"" are way too childish and annoying. not even the series was that much. and the other Lego Star Wars weren't either.because of this, it's not really worth the price. 6/10			"

												This is by far the worst Lego game you'll find. I can barely even quantify the reasons its bad, it just is. The models are uglier, the jokes are either nonexistant or sexist, and every single segment you go through seems to be something thats designed to kill you for no reason.The other Lego games have thought put into them. The puzzles are made for kids, but they're still puzzles, and the level design is usually just as charming as the visuals. This game just fills boring-looking rooms with 30 respawning droids and asks you to put one thing together while they're shooting at you. Its a pointlessly annoying video game.I got to the spaceship section and immediately uninstalled. The controls were sub-par (even given how hard they are to mess up with this kind of game) throughout the rets of the experience, but that level was just unacceptable. You get knocked and jitter every way but the way you're going, and if you even look at a wall you go flying in a random direction. There's *something* shooting at you, but you have no way of knowing how to avoid damage. These games are made around forgivingness. The worst penalty for dying in these games is just losing money. But the awful frequency at which the game just decides to be terrible and fill a section with unavoidable damage is incredible. There's almost no penalty for dying, but because you never feel like it's your fault, each death just feels like an insult.Buy the other Lego Star Wars games. Buy any other Lego game. This is the last one you should even consider.			"

												I don't feel it is a great choice if you are new to the lego game series.didn't get on with this game. I have no idea what i'm suppose to be doing most of the time. The instructions are non existent, i've tried exploring a bit and still, every part of the game seems to leave me in a room with no instruction as to how to get out. I keep getting hint messages telling me what to do.. but still nothing happens when i try and do it. definitely not a game for those who have never played the lego games before. presume you need to be experienced with them before this is any funEDIT:Perhaps I need to clarify a few things that I said above. I'm not saying that the game itself is bad, I can see it is highly regarded by others as a good game. The puzzle solving concept with a lego, star wars theme is right up my street. The problem I have with this game is that I don't feel it is a great choice if you are new to the lego game series. This is the message I wanted to get across to people. I understand that it is a sequel to existing games, however, I would have liked there to be a simple (perhaps optional) tutorial that gently walks a person through the games concepts so that I could play this game without having played any others in the lego series.Consider my situation and then my experience with the game.I am someone who has never played any lego game before, I do not have a spouse or sibling here with me to give me a brief overview of how to play the game. The first thing I do is click start game. I then watch a 2 minute video that sets the scene and the game begins. The game expects me to know(1) what the game controls are (I think a lot of people will tend to have a brief look before they play, like I did, but I expect many will like to figure most of this stuff out as they play). (2) Knowledge about switching players(3) What actions each character can do (4) Know how the use special actions with certain characters (e.g. using the force to push an object)I feel that this is already quite a lot to have to know about, and then on top of all this, if I don't figure all of this out within a 3 minute time period, the characters get attacked by monsters and I failed that bit of the level. I then get put back to the start menu and click play game, I have to sit through the same 2 minute video again because there didn't appear to be an obvious way to skip it.I do this 3 or 4 times, before I google how to escape this first scene. I would say that’s a pretty poor introduction to a game... And the game goes on, without the time pressure element, but still there is little guidance for the kind of things I'm expected to do. I would say that the game hasn't given me the right opportunities to established a thought process that I need, that will allow me to explore the ideas ive already been introduced to, and using what ive learnt to complete new challenges.Now, I believe that if the game designers target audience were new players who had never played any lego game before, this first sequence would never have passed testing! I think they would have put greater focus on a step-by-step learning process within the opening challenges of the game before the player is thrown in at the deep end. There are no tutorial level and very little in terms of introducing players to the game concepts. I therefore have to assume that the designers of the game were intending this to be a game for more experienced players.That is all there is to it. I think that if I had known this before purchasing the game, I would definetly have bought a different game from the lego series. One that would allow a beginner to have a good time.			"

												As a massive fan of both Star Wars and the LEGO game franchise of course I'm gonna love this. If you've played any of the other LEGO games you pretty much know a lot of the basics you're gonna find here. It's a great time, although I did find it infinitely more frustrating than any of the others. You can play the game in pretty much any order you want. There are three branching ""chapters"" if you will. One centered around Count Dooku, one centered around Asajj Ventress, and one centered around General Grievous. There's no specific order you have to play the levels in, but it almost feels like the game wants you to play them in a certain order, and I can't figure out quite what that order is. There were levels I would play and feel almost lost. There is very little explanation of what you're supposed to do, which is a surprising rarity for the series. While I like not being obnoxiously prompted toward everything and enjoy some challenge, there have already been some times I've had to check game guides to figure out how in the world to do certain things. Destroying gold structures, for instance, requires you to hit them with rapid fire or a consistent laser beam. And I only know that because I looked it up. Not once in five hours has the game told me that, which seems a detriment, especially since the game is meant for kids. However despite that it is a load of fun, and the newly added RTS levels feel very thematically appropriate, since the Clone Wars is, well, war. It works well with the story, and once you know what you're doing it's an absolute blast. Honestly my biggest problem is that it's really buggy for me for some reason, which has kept me from being able to complete certain levels. In one R2-D2 wouldn't hover no matter how hard I tried to make him, and in one Captain Rex completely disappeared after a while, right when I realized he was the only character I had who I needed anymore. But I imagine at least that last problem is something that will be fixed by restarting the level, so while it's annoying I'm assuming it's not too game-breaking.			"

												The Lego Star Wars Games were the first set of lego games and are what made the games so popular with kids and adults alike. They are funny, family friendly and were able to tell a story simply with the character's grunts an giggles. Does Lego Star Wars 3 live up to the expectation?The first thing you will notice is that the animations have been significantly overhauled which some may consider a good thing and some won't. The characters don't feel or look like toys anymore which I like. There's enough cartoon like momments that make the game feel like you are playing with one massive Lego set but I would have prefered they had just made the animations more realistic and left the character designs like they were in Lego Star Wars 1 and 2. The game is quite like an RPG. The hub is no longer a small cantina, it is two massive spaceships (republic and seperatist) and a big chunk of space in between the ships. You can hop in mini lego spaceships (and some classics like Slave 1) and defeat the enemy which will convert the planet you are fighting over to your chosen faction. The levels are what you would expect from a Lego game, simplistic puzzles that an eight year old could solve, straightforward bossfights and lots, and lots of jumping!Lego Star Wars 3 is a good game but has taken Lego characters to the point were they look a lot more realistic, the animation overhaul is well done but there really isn't much of a challenge to be had. 7.75/10			"

												The Lego Star Wars Games were the first set of lego games and are what made the games so popular with kids and adults alike. They are funny, family friendly and were able to tell a story simply with the character's grunts an giggles. Does Lego Star Wars 3 live up to the expectation?The first thing you will notice is that the animations have been significantly overhauled which some may consider a good thing and some won't. The characters don't feel or look like toys anymore which I like. There's enough cartoon like momments that make the game feel like you are playing with one massive Lego set but I would have prefered they had just made the animations more realistic and left the character designs like they were in Lego Star Wars 1 and 2.

												I've owned this game for a while, but never really gave it a chance because it was for the kids. But just invested 5 hours in this and it has got to the best Lego game I've ever played (to date).Ample missions-three main story plots-travel the star system and find bonus missions-side missions with either Jedi or Sith objectives-all of the above have added replay-ability in free play modeMultiplayer is co-op in all missions (this is typical of any Lego game) there's even an option to play player vs player in arcade mode (not-so-typical tower defense/king of the hill game play)Lots of characters and vehiclesLOTS OF CHARACTERS AND VEHICLESnow for the disadvantages:-some bugs and glitches (this game is a little older)-cut scenes are definitely way too cheesy (even for kids)-no voice acting at all-no cloud support for saved gamesOverall I'm really impressed with the quantity of content. A must-have for any star wars fan (did i mention you can travel the galaxy).

												This Game is MUCH HARDER than the first 3 games 1-3, 4-6, and 1-6.  it doesnt give you much help like target enemy A with character C riding Vehicle B  but it doesn't tell you very well like should it be annakin riding vehicle B or Padme?This game still is loads of fun though.  some of the old combos still exist like (PS2 controller style) X+X+square is the classical downward slam that wreks droidikas shields. there is motion control with the force so it may become even harder.but still worth the agonizingly different difficulty levels to have fun with. better suited for the more experienced Lego Star Wars Player.

												Fisrt of all, it's one of the typical LEGO games. It's graphics is too high for animation-cartoon games and it's controls are too easy. Every detail make a strong bond with you and game at the point that you start to boring it makes you little suprises. Characters have some little jokes between each other and they have little details like that Dart Vader have classic breathing sound. I can make review for you as score:+Playing: 10/8 (Just 6 different move)+Characters: 10/10 (With every detail)+Graphs: 10/10 (If you don't want graphs like GTA V :D)+Scenario: 10/9 (It have enough story time)-You must collect to many object for finish game 100% so it's too long.As you see it deserve this money but i recommend buy this game on discount :) Have fun with this amazing game ;			"

												Possibly the best LEGO® game to date. Despite using a weaker part of the franchise as basis (Clone Wars, compared to the actual Movies), the game is surprisingly diverse, even introducing a new gameplay element: RTS sections that end up being very enjoyable, despite the ""hands in"" approach (no god view, no micro management). Strong character and powers roster, a lengthy campaign (though only covering the first season of the show), many side missions and hidden collectibles make for a most fun game!Recommended to: Fans of LEGO® games, fan of Star Wars® games, anyone wanting to pass a good time!

The game itself is amazing,  if only it had controler support then i would recomend this game  but wait, it has controller support!. There is co-op, but on a keyboard? Probably not the easiest thing in the world. this game is probable easyer to play on the wii than on a keyboard. However that aside, this game is amazing. This game has some awesome tower defence missions and you can battle your friends with an attack and tower defence gamemode. Have no friends? Well it doesn't matter because you can play that gamemode against te computer in a different type of the same gamemode. And play this on many of the planets that were local in the clone wars!

												Possibly the best LEGO® game to date. Despite using a weaker part of the franchise as basis (Clone Wars, compared to the actual Movies), the game is surprisingly diverse, even introducing a new gameplay element: RTS sections that end up being very enjoyable, despite the ""hands in"" approach (no god view, no micro management). Strong character and powers roster, a lengthy campaign (though only covering the first season of the show), many side missions and hidden collectibles make for a most fun game!Recommended to: Fans of LEGO® games, fan of Star Wars® games, anyone wanting to pass a good time!

												The Lego Star Wars Games were the first set of lego games and are what made the games so popular with kids and adults alike. They are funny, family friendly and were able to tell a story simply with the character's grunts an giggles. Does Lego Star Wars 3 live up to the expectation?The first thing you will notice is that the animations have been significantly overhauled which some may consider a good thing and some won't. The characters don't feel or look like toys anymore which I like. There's enough cartoon like momments that make the game feel like you are playing with one massive Lego set but I would have prefered they had just made the animations more realistic and left the character designs like they were in Lego Star Wars 1 and 2. The game is quite like an RPG. The hub is no longer a small cantina, it is two massive spaceships (republic and seperatist) and a big chunk of space in between the ships. You can hop in mini lego spaceships (and some classics like Slave 1) and defeat the enemy which will convert the planet you are fighting over to your chosen faction. The levels are what you would expect from a Lego game, simplistic puzzles that an eight year old could solve, straightforward bossfights and lots, and lots of jumping!Lego Star Wars 3 is a good game but has taken Lego characters to the point were they look a lot more realistic, the animation overhaul is well done but there really isn't much of a challenge to be had. 7.75/10			"

												Excellent game for anyone that is a Star Wars fan but definately need a game pad for the best experience.  The only frustrating thing I have to say about it is that with free play it is very hard to get the characters you need.			"

												Great game, that gives you many hours of fun. Even when you are finished with the Story Mode you can go on and replay all the levels to collect all the Secret Charactes.Only downside is that sometimes you don't really know what to do in a Level.			"

												Fun game with great graphics.  I've always had a love for Star Wars (particularly the Clone Wars) and this only strengthens it more.  The comedic addition of lego characters in the story creates a feeling of relief while still fulfilling the inner adventurer.  The plot and story are right in-line with the TV series, and include most of the well known characters.  I highly recommend this game for anyone looking to have a good time.			"

												17/12/16Another great LEGO game that will make you put at least 20+ hours just for unlocking every notch and cranny in this crafted game.Pros:Great character selectionGood looking visuals for its age35+ hours of contentMost missions are funCons:Way to repetitive in its ""ground assault"" modeCan get annoying again with ground assault mode.Those are my thoughts!I rate this game an 8.5/10It is a good break from all of the other games and is very fun in the process. Could be improved with the ground assault mode. "

												It's a LEGO game so it's already a good game, either for the little ones, or the adults that still grab the lego bricks to build with imagination. The humor and cameos are there, and the bonus missions are a good way to pass the time. Still i recommend more the Lego Star Wars the Complete Saga.[SPOILER ALERT]It's just a shame that it doesn't cover more of the seasons of Star Wars The Clone Wars, I really want to play more Maul, and the story around his return, or the story about the force, and the father, son and daughter in the mystical secret place, i think it would have been a good lego episode.

												Surprisingly fun. Jumping from the original Lego Star Wars to this was weird seeing as a lot of the enviroments are no longer lego but that takes nothing away from the appeal. One of the most intuitive hub worlds I've ever seen and that is due to the fact it is almost dynamic. As you do more things in the game you unlock more of the hub world and there are huge aspects of the game you'll never even see if you don't take the time to explore. I am not a major fan of the clone wars series, but you don't need to be to enjoy this unique experience of a lego game. The only drawback to this game I can think of is character customization (which is one of the features you discover through exploration) feels limited. If I want to put R2's head on Obi-Wan's body then let me make that man a cyborg!TL;DR:-Unique gameplay-Great Hub World-Lots to do-Some features feel limitedOverall I would give this game an 8.7/10.Worth full price but keep it on wishlist for a while if you aren't dedicated to a love of legos, or Star Wars, and wait for a sale.

												My 3~4yo son loves it.Pros:- very charming characters and tons of them;- Tons of things to do, the main hub is huge and you can travel between separatist and republic ships;- Codes to unlock new characters, so you don't have to play the whole thing, tho it's really fun to get the mini-kits and see the kids excitement for the new character.Cons:- The game isn't intuitive at all, actually, it's counter intuitive, be prepared to check guides and stare to the screen for a while to find out what you have to do; - The split screen is great to play with the kids, tho it can get messy with you need to hit targets that are too far away; - Jedis are overpowered and I hate to play with non-jedi toons.The main problem is that the game is counter intuitive, but I have heard that most of lego games are like that. Otherwise is really amusing!			"

												FINNALY! Almost a year ago I got LEGO Star Wars The Force Awakens on Playstation and 3 years ago I got LEGO Star Wars The Complete Saga for PC. I got those games first because I thought they were better than LEGO Star Wars III, but today I decided to get the game so I can complete my LEGO Star Wars video game collection. After I got it, it became, not just my favourite LEGO game, but my favourite Star Wars game overall. I would recommend it 100%. The story is really great, there is A LOT of stuff to do at the hub and it's just a fun game overall. So, get it!			"
