												Honestly, the best game of its kind. It has some of the wittiest and most amusing story lines ,dark and mature mixed with tragedy that will take you by surprise.Beautiful visual design, great mix of colors and nicely put together levels that will remind you of Tim Burton's films. Voice acting & dialogues are excellent as you would come to expect with Tim Schafer produced games.Fun combat & platforming mechanics, they serve their purpose but are nothing ground breaking and some of the segments can overstay their welcome slightly.One part i found was annoying was that you have to grind for money to purchase an item to progress further, which interrupts the pacing somewhat.All in all a great title which is sadly overlooked by people. Highly recommend to any one who likes FUN.			"

												(I could have sworn that I had already wrote a review of this, but oh well)Psychonauts, one of the last great 3d platformers. Straight from the mind of Tim Schafer. 9/10+A distinctive, and interesting visual style+A fleshed out, imaginative world+Some of the funniest diologue this side of... well... Grim Fandango+Odd, interesting characters+An awesome soundtrack+Clever, and unconventional level design (I feel like pointing out The Milkman Conspiracy, Lungfishopoplis, and the Velvet stage)+Psychic bears-The texture work is very dated-I should not have to look in the key bindings to figure out how to do a certain command when there is a forty-five minute long tutorial!-You guys did not buy this game, and therefore there will never be a sequel (or a remake)			"

												Psychonauts is this type of game, that was made with love and passion firstly and business strategy lastly in mind.On the positive side: Art vision and design level are top notch. Every world in game feels, looks and plays very differently; Original premise for story and whole plotline is very engaging; Clever and funny writing; New powers (12 in total, which is more than enough) unlocked through the game make gameplay fresh till the end;On the negative side: Some collectibles are very hard to see, so collecting them could be frustrating experience; Sometimes camera decides you are having too much fun and it is time to make your life worse; Cutscenes pre-rendered in a low resolution (800x600 i think). Because of that they look very bad;tl;dr: you should play it if you like platformers/adventure, good original story, creative art and want something unique to experience.			"

												Psychonauts hails from a golden age of gaming where developers poured passion into their creations and weren't completely drunk with greed. Great story, crafty gameplay and plenty of achievements and collectables. One of the most creative and original games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Highly entertaining, highly recommended. Play this game.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Psychonauts Original Release: 2005 Genre Tags: Adventure; RPG; Platformer; Lighthearted; Psychedelic My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 15-25 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Casual gamersREVIEWPsychonauts is a quirky and imaginative action-adventure game that is an absolute riot.  It is an aging specimen, but it will forever hold a status as a highly enjoyable “cult classic.”  If it has piqued your interest, then I suggest you take a complimentary cup of Kool-Aid and join the cult… you won’t regret it.Psychonauts excels at many things.  The story, the characters, and the writing are all top-notch and well-executed.  The scenes and developments throughout the campaign are quite amusing and should keep you thoroughly entertained.  The many different characters are all interesting in their own way.  They are all splendidly eccentric and unique, if not also reminiscent of typical Saturday-morning-cartoon archetypes.  And, importantly, the voice acting is mostly decent and sufficiently holds everything else together… although it does falter slightly, on occasion.   Providing setting for the narrative is a very inspired and diverse gameworld that is quite atmospheric.  The graphics used are undeniably dated and are only increasingly falling farther behind the curve; however the developers did an outstanding job of matching the environments and atmosphere to the overall soul of the game.  There is a mixture of lighthearted, noir, cartoonish, and psychedelic ambiances which really diversifies the experience as you play through the campaign.   You may not be awed by the scenery like in modern games, but you can still easily appreciate the effort that was put into the creation of the gameworld.Of course, the intriguing narrative and captivating atmosphere would be for naught if the gameplay wasn’t enjoyable.  Luckily, Psychonauts is quite fun to play.  There is a pleasant mixture of combat situations and puzzle-solving that you would expect from a game like this.  Situations can be approached by experimentation with various abilities and skills, which you unlock as you progress through the campaign.  Also, the various levels will introduce different dynamics to keep you on your toes.  There are also a ton of collectibles and many achievements to keep you busy, if you are into that kind of thing.Psychonauts can easily appeal to a wide and diverse audience.  The tone is fairly childish, but has many adult themes.  It is also a pretty easy/casual experience, so there shouldn’t be any skill issues.  It takes approximately 14 to 22 hours to complete, depending on if you strive for achievements or not.  If you like 3D action-adventure platformers, I would say this is a pretty safe bet for you.  It is also a good bet for anyone who may be interested in “seeing what the fuss is about,” as you will probably find it enjoyable once given a try.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												     Personally this is my favorite Double Fine game. Although it is about nine years old it still holds up as a good game with an interesting art style. Unlike most games built as an atempt at photorealism, the extremely cartoonish graphics and garish colour palette still looks good almost a decade after release. As all games from Tim Schafer the writing is magnificent, the voice acting is well done and the characters always have something important or hilarious to say. The setting of a Summer camp for Psychics not only influences the plot and gameplay but the dialogues actually sound like something children at summer camp would be saying, except that they are about the outlandish topics involved with a world surrounded by psychic weirdness. The gameplay is devided up into two sections, the overworld with some, but not much combat, sidequests, the one shop in the game, and most of the colorful non-essential dialogue, and the insides of the various character's minds. These minds serve as the various levels of the game, each with the same basic controlls but slightly different gameplay. The Meat Circus level is all about fast paced platforming, whilst Lungfishopolis is completely based on the combat system, and the Milkman level(BEST LEVEL EVER) is an old school inventory adventure puzzle mixed with a fever dream X-Files Plot. Throughout the game you gain psy powers that are used in combat and level navigation, some work as a long range attack with the need to collect ammo, and there is a bouncy ball/parachute power that makes platforming much more difficult and interesting.     Now that i have sufficiently gushed about all the things i freaking love about this game it is time to get realistic and talk about the flaws. Most of these flaws have to do with the fact that this was Double Fine's first attempt at an action game. the combat can be a bit annoying with enemy spamming getting overdone at times, that being said most of the basic enemies are too easy to dispatch and clearing the room becomes simply a chore without much actual difficulty. The controlls are somewhat soft and the platforming would be vastly improved by tighter controlls to allow for fine tuned navigation. and if you watch a let's play you can see that the dificulty scale starts off low but when it does ramp up it does so without telling you and later levels,(Milkman,Meat Circus) can become frustrating and take forever to get past, not allways from dificulty of combat or platforming but in the milkman level if you do not know what you are doing it can be almost impossible to figure some of the puzzles out organically.     All that being said these flaws are really not as bad as it sounds. the increased difficulty lends less to frustraton and more to angry inspiration to just beat this next level and prove that you are better than the game. and for the milkman, a quick glance at a gameFAQ can help if you get too badlt stuck, enough people have been frustrated by the level to have wonderfull walkthroughs made to relieve the tension. in the end the story and experience is so good it makes up for any akwardness in gameplay. 8/10, This game is a love it or hate it, and i love it, fantastic but not even close to perfect.

												Psychonauts has to be one the greatest Adventure/Platformers of our time, it succeeds in achieving the best aspects of the genre. The controls are tight allowing for great platforming and visually still looks better than most games today. The Steam version of Psychonauts is brilliant, I have not experienced a single bug and it supports HD. The exploration this game offers is top-notch, you get to explore a large camp littered with clever secrets and challenges along with some of the most insane levels. The combat is entertaining, especially since you get decent upgrades and new powers as you go along, allowing you to form more strategies so it never feels like a boring slogfest.The art direction of Psychonauts is unlike any other game and is vibrant and unique, you have to wonder what the devs were on when making some of the characters and the sound/soundtrack do their job pretty well. The way this game progresses in terms of difficulty and design is persistent and can get fairly challenging later on in the game. The dialogue is extremely well done adding a lot of life to some of the strangest looking characters in video gaming. The game features a dark/twisted humour which adds to the hilarity of the situations you encounter.This game gets much better the further you get, the levels get much more abstract and crazier, theres a few here which are total masterpieces and the plot is surprisingly deep for a game of this nature and extremely entertaining. The amount of imagination put into this game is amazing, the art direction is it's own, the characters are brilliant, the level design is solid, the combat and platforming are tight, the atmosphere is effective, the humour is hilarious as hell and never feels like they tried hard to make it that way, so it doesn't feel forced like many other games that try achieve a comical effect and is loaded with charm, there really is nothing negative about this game. To get this on Steam is a no brainer as it's an incredibly solid experience that should be experienced by anyone who appreciates Adventure and platforming games and timeless classics. Squirrels are liars.

												A superb underappreciated game with some of the most creative levels, writing and design I've seen in a game. It falls a little bit short when it comes to the gameplay aspects of it (e.g. clunky platforming), but it doesn't ruin the experience in the slightest. The musical score of the game also deserves a special honorable mention. It is absolutely worth its' price in my opinion.			"

 Psychonauts is one of the best games I’ve ever played. In this long post I will describe in detail why that is true. Psychonauts is a 3D platformer game with very peculiar art style, great characters and awesome story line. 1. Story & Characters  (Spoiler Free don’t worry)The main place where almost every action of the game takes place is a summer camp for children with psychic abilities (Something like X-Men). The main character is named Razputin, Raz for short, a young child which goes alone to that summer camp without his father’s permission.There are around 20 kids in the camp and you can interact with every one of them. There are also a couple of adults which are training the young psychics. The main story is very interesting and will hook you in. I don’t want to say anything related to it because I don’t want to spoil something unintentionally All children[i.imgur.com]2. Gameplay & Graphics.The gameplay is very solid; you have a lot of things to do. The game feels very open world to me. It has 6 separated locations plus a couple more which are not placed on the map. The game features very common gameplay mechanics: Double jump (later on you will acquire something with which you will jump even higher), normal punch attack and 3 slots for special attacks. I highly hope you will ignore the graphics, because they are not so good and hope you will give the game a chance.I highly doubt they will remaster it so no need to wait.3.  Level design.This by far is the best aspect of the game. They are so well made, with high attention to details -  almost perfect. I will always remember 2 levels in my mind: Waterloo World and Milkman Conspiracy.  Both are in the later part of the game. The Waterloo World has such awesome ideas and I will try to explain it without any spoilers. In that level your body can exist in 3 states - Large (normal), medium and small. In order to beat the level, you need to switch between the states and interact with stuff whereby you can’t in other states. Milkman Conspiracy is so abstract it makes you question your sanity (Please don’t think it’s too deep). There are very nice gameplay mechanics in this level and you need to get used to it quite fast so you can beat it (A lot of backtracking for achievement hunters). Almost every level introduces its own gameplay mechanic. And that’s why the game is so good. You never feel bored with it.4. Comedy.Comedy plays a big part in the game. Almost every character is funny on its own. You’ll never feel that a joke is forced. Every joke is balanced and put right on spot. There are 2 abilities which I used more often than necessary, just because they made situations way funnier. The first ability is called Bacon - when you use it, a character appears in your mind and tells you his advice on the current situation, points out weak spots for the boss fights and sometimes makes funny jokes. The other is an ability acquired later on the game, which allows you to see yourself through the eyes of others and - oh, boy - I laughed my ♥♥♥ off with that. The developers put a lot of effort into this ability to show different pictures of you for everything that you can view yourself through. I’m sure I did not get all the jokes and I’m sure there are many more. Seen by a thing which loves cake[i.imgur.com]5. Abilities & Ranking system.There are in total 101 PSI cadet ranks. Once you have gathered a PSI Core combined with 9 PSI cards to it, you are granted a cadet rank. You need to buy a lot of PSI Cores from the in-game shop. There is no such thing as a skill tree in this game. The game gives you abilities when you reach certain cadet rank.6. AchievementsThis is for all who are going to attempt to get all achievements:Most achievements are fairly easy and you will find no problem getting them. Many are story related so you can’t miss them. A couple are quite tricky because if you progress too far in a current level you can’t obtain them anymore.  I used a spoiler-free guide to see when I should take a minute and visit a place.There are 3 very hard achievements:  ""I LOVE PUNCHING!"" I think this achievement takes place in the very first big level and - oh, boy, believe me - it’s very hard. The problem is that it requires skill but the controls are poorly done for PC users. It’s a living nightmare to do it with keyboard and mouse. I’ve read that it’s easier to achieve with controller. I’ve put in a lot of effort to obtain it. (You will need this achievement for “Math is Hard” achievement)Another very hard achievement is called:""Math is Hard"". If you are a collectible hunter by nature you will find no problem in getting this achievement. Briefly explained: you need to collect everything before the POINT OF NO RETURN. And yes there is a certain point where you can’t go back. Personally I’m not a big fan of such implementations, because everyone can ♥♥♥♥ up. At least they put a handy “Save” with the same name (POINT OF NO RETURN) and if you think you’ve missed something you can reload that save and complete those things you’ve missed.The last “hard” achievement is actually not hard at all. It requires you to buy an item from the in-game store (it’s not micro-transaction) on Christmas. I know you can change your PC date and get the achievement very easily, but since Christmas is very close I decided to wait.7. CollectiblesThere are 7 types of collectibles: Figments, Vaults, Emotional Baggage, PSI cards(PSI cards+core), Scavenger hunt items, Brains and Cobwebs. In any part of the map, when you open the menu it shows how many collectibles you can find. There are a lot of figments - like 100 per level and sometimes they blend so much with the level itself it is hard to find them. Vaults are really interesting,  they share screenshots of a certain character’s past and it’s made like an old movie - I love those. There are very messed up vaults which really can affect your mood after seeing them. Emotional Baggages are collected in a strange way. Imagine it to be doors -  you need to find the key and the door itself; sometimes you will find the door before the key.  Usually on every part of the map there are a certain number of PSI cards and like 1 PSI Core (with cards). There are 16 scavenger hunt items in total and some are quite hard to find. Once you gather 8, you are granted 4 levels at once. When you find the rest you get another 4 levels.  Cobwebs are tricky because you need a tool from the in-game shop in order to collect them. Usually there are 5-6 per level. Once gathered you can redeem them for PSI cards.Overall they are fun to collect. You need all of collectibles for “Math is Hard” achievement.All collectables[i.imgur.com]8. How I got to know of this game.FunHause YouTube channel is a channel which I watch very often. One of the members of this channel kept talking about this game non-stop and eventually I checked it out. His name is James  Williems9. Psychonauts 2The game raised 3.5 million dollars through crowdfunding from investors and other people. And I’m super-duper hyped for the second game. They even gave James Williams a voice acting role because he did an insane job popularising the game. Video from the developers10. Final verdict and thoughts.On a scale from 0 to 10, I will give  Psychonauts 9/10 without a doubt. It’s one hell of a good game and with this kind of a review I hope it made you check it out yourself. Huge respect to Double Fine for creating such a good game.Awesome credit picture[i.imgur.com] "

												My previous review of this game did not do it justice since I felt it deserved better than that - I'd like to elaborate a bit further on why I love this game ever so much as one of the best innovative games/platformers of all time. Growing up with 2D and 3D platformers like Mario, Crash & Spyro I could easily adapt to the platforming of the game. The platforming itself is solid enough but the actual combat in the game, during times like Boss Battles, can be dodgy as heck if you don't have a controller in handy -- Usually because of several different buttons needed to lock-on enemies and attack or alternatively dodge incoming attacks. You have the option of changing the keys to fit a play-style suitable for yourself, but I still find it frustrating at best namely due to the several important commands required. Here's my advice: Play the game with a controller as it'll make gameplay a bit smoother. So, what makes the game exceptional? Well, first of all it's the premise. The setting is a summer school camp for psychics. The game is brought to us by none other than the master of adventure games, Tim Schäfer (Monkey Island, Grim Fandango, Day of the Tentacle), whose characteristic sense of humor certainly blooms in Psychonauts. One of the long running concepts of Schäfer's style usually juxtaposes a rather mundane situation in a fantastical setting; Such as what you'd expect if Tim Burton & David Lynch teamed up for an all-wacky-superstar tag team line up movie. Which is just as well because creator Tim Schäfer has now acquired his very own Johnny Depp, in form of Jack Black, although he's absent from this game. But I digress - We play as Raz, who's chosen to flee from the circus as opposed to joining it, because being a Psychonaut is a lot more fulfilling than the circus obviously. As he gets accepted into the fold of Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp he soon finds himself in the middle of a strange conspiracy, where the brains of the camp's inhabitants mysteriously vanish which leads to the game's funniest moments. The caricatures that show up in the game are so incredibly diverse and... weird? They are truly fascinating as you get to DIG your way inside their subconscious minds to discover their true hidden feelings. Essentially, Schäfer came up with the idea of Inception before... well Inception. This is the unique part of the game - The environments, atmosphere and overall feel of the inner & deepest thoughts of the camp and local areas inhabitants's minds.Let me sum up some of the fascinating characters. We have a mad dentist who harvest brains, a talking fish whose thoughts involves a sequence where you become a giant Godzilla monster terrorizing a society of talking fish, a mentally ill security guard who's lost in the mindset of a crazy pyromaniac-milkman, Napoleon Bonaparte and his dimwit descendant, An aspiring musical starlet whose cruel mother's treatment of her and eventual suicide has caused her to develop a case of bipolar disorder, a government agent who disguises himself as a housewife by brandishing a rolling pin while talking disjointedly about pies etc. These are the kind of characters you can expect alongside the campers themselves and the local counselors, whom all are very well rounded and have their own personalities. Usually they are defined by interacting with them around the camp or examining the local signs and written letters, to provide character depth. Lastly, I found myself jamming to the game's cool blues-inspired guitar stringing soundtrack. All in all It's seemingly -- Well done. If you love a good platformer, with some dodgy gameplay at times, while every now and then laughing your ♥♥♥ off and maybe, just maybe, find yourself sympathizing with some of the loonies, as you uncover their hidden feelings. Then look no further than Psychonauts! :)			"

												Psychonauts is like a book with a weird cover. It's a game worth getting into though, even if your eyes might not agree with the art design. Once I got past my nitpicking, I finally gave it the shot it so very deserved. Psychonauts is a 3D platformer meets an adventure game and honestly, I had no idea about the former. As with all platformers, you'll die plenty from falling, which is partly due to a fixed camera and partly cos you suck. Then there are a couple of areas that just aren't very forgiving, but it's nothing you can't overcome. I'd say the difficulty level is just right for this sort of game, apart from the initally daunting and almost sadistic Meat Circus.It's funny, charming and fun to explore. Finding collectibles is made enjoyable, but you'll have to look out for a Point of No Return, otherwise you won't get 100%. The music from Milla's Dance Party is still in my head, a level that reminded me of the club mission in DmC Devil May Cry. I doubt Ninja Theory were influenced by Psychonauts, these games being such opposites, nevertheless I found it amusing.First Double Fine/Tim Schafer game now under my belt and I'll be checking out more from them. If it weren't for the massive development budgets we have right now, we'd see more cool games like these. Games like No One Lives Forever 3, which I'm still rooting for.			"

												When i look at the steam screenshots of this game i remember how i doubted this game so much. In fact the pictures from the camp display the worst parts of the game - The parts that took me so long to actually complete when i had the game as i just couldn't see the brilliance in this title by playing it a bit and looking at the pictures.  And who could have? the screenshots dont just justice at all to this game. Trailers? not much either. You have to experience the weird worlds and platforming that takes place yourself.  Everyone probably has this game in their libraries but how many have actually played it? install it now and play it - with time. Don't try to half-♥♥♥ it as this title demands some effort from the player too before the hook sinks in. But once it does it sits in pretty hard. I was sold around the time i did the paranoid kids 'spy-vs-spy' kind of world and the colorful bull-run world and that was later in the game.  That's all i want to say about this. Good luck finding all the figments.			"

												So I picked up Psychonauts in 2016 for $1. People spoke pretty highly of this game, and I wanted something that could run on my laptop, so I got it. It took me about 20 hours to beat (longer than expected) and now that I have, I must say this game is absolutely brilliant. It's not perfect, it can be frustrating and the design isn't as polished as it could be, but I soon reached a point where I was so invested in the characters and storyline I was willing to put up with these blemishes in order to see things through.I'd like to start with the biggest strength of the game: the levels. In the game, you have to stop this sinister plot of lobotomies and kidnappings, and you do so by traveling into the minds of various people, often as a means of getting them to aid you. As such, most of the levels consist of navigating a specific mind, and each mind/level has its own unique aesthetics, mechanics, and tasks to complete. For instance, there's a level in here where you explore a mind that takes the form of a sprawling metropolis, and you play as a Godzilla-like monster that destroys it. The goal of this level is to destroy a tower in the center of the city, there are tanks and other anti-Godzilla weapons, and you get introduced to a shield, which you pretty much have learn to use to beat this level. There's another level where you encounter a mind that places you as a piece in board game. You have to talk to the other pieces (they have fun things to say), and deliver them food or money or munitions in order to deploy them and beat your opponent. This level involves some tricky platforming and light puzzle-solving, and I personally loved its aesthetic. A lot of these levels also feature their own boss/bosses, each of which is as unique as the environment they inhabit, and you'll have to figure out their vulnerabilities and how to exploit them.Since the levels are based on the minds of people you meet, you will encounter all sorts of interesting, complex people. I developed an emotional attachment to many of them which really gave me a sense of satisfaction in beating the various levels. For instance, you meet someone in anguish over a lost love, and it was so cathartic helping that character let go. And many of these characters are not all they seem. You may also punch, levitate, and attempt to ignite many of these characters to hear them make all sorts of indignant responses.I want to touch more on the gameplay. It's a third-person platformer from the PS2 era. Seems pretty bland, but they give you a whole slew of psychic powers and a diverse selection of enemies to use them on. I very much enjoyed the combat, though I wasn't much of a fan of the platforming. (This is partly because I'm not very good at platformers and because I played the whole game with a mouse an keyboard.) There were parts of the game where I'd jump, miss, and then get bumped back to the last checkpoint and have to do it over again. That being said, I feel like the game has enough checkpoint to not be too maddening or punishing. The game really gets difficult towards the end, make no mistake of that, but it's doable if you have the patience.Speaking of frustration, the game does have some annoying design issues. Remember, this is an old game. Because it's third person, sometimes the camera decides to jump behind a wall and you lose sight of your character. The game also gives you a lock-on tool to assist in aiming, and sometimes it doesn't recognize a target and points you in the opposite direction you wanted, and that causes you to miss your window of attack. And there are some glitches like where your character gets stuck, but you can normally jump around to free yourself. Again, if you have the patience, these aren't too damning.In conclusion, the game is clever in its world-building, characters, and gameplay, just remember that it's an old, tough platformer.			"

												I should've played this game 5 years ago but it's never too late.If you:- like cartoons- like classic arcade-y games- are feeling nostalgic of old games- like good game mechanics- don't care about fancy graphics- like silly humor and fun charactersPlay this. It's great. Seriously, just launch it and try it for 5 minutes.			"

												I'm not normally a fan of platformers; I get frustrated far too easily.Psychonauts, though, is different.It's easy enough to be entertaining, well-written (silly dialogue and nods to pop-culture abound), and the voice-acting is amusing and well-performed.On some video cards, the background and some scenery may flicker, but it's not bad enough to affect play.

												This is easily my favourite Double Fine game, and that's saying a lot.At its core this is a third person action adventure platform title, but such a dry description really does not do it justice.It is happiness and nostalgia distilled into a quirky game about getting into people's minds, literally.No generic fire level, ice level, jungle level.Let's visits MINDS.The mind of a war veteran.The mind of a painter obsessed with bullfighting.The mind of a faded actress.THE MIND OF A SEA MONSTER.A great story, a great cast, a great WORLD created for you to explore and discover.Yes, the game has some balance issues, but most of these have been patched out for the Steam release (especially difficulty balancing in the last world).It's a great game that I totally recommend.

												Be warned that this is an early-2000s 3d platformer and it really shows- annoying collect-a-thons and all. A controller is recommended if you have access to one- the keyboard controls work but can be a little wonky at times. Some very difficult platforming throughout brings these niggles to light and can be frustrating.Where Psychonauts shines instead is in the hugely imaginative (literally!) world and cast of characters, who play the role of both plot progression and game world. Raz's psychic abilities allow him to enter the minds of those who let him in, in order to arrange their thoughts and solve their problems for them- learning their secrets in the meanwhile. Battle Napoleon in a giant game of Risk, help the Milkman defeat the evil girl scouts, and maybe even help Raz confront his childhood fears. Erik Wolpaw, who would later join Valve to write the Portal and Team Fortress series, lends his talents to these characters and ensures they'll leave a big impression on you. If you can forgive the difficulties with the gameplay, the humour on display here is wholly worth it.			"

												First off I'm gonna tell you one thing, buy this game, and then I'll explain why you should. This game is absolutely fantastic. It's fun, it's got a great story, great characters, and hilarious (if not somewhat cheesy) dialogue.The story is quite interesting, but it's actually really enhanced by the characters. Double Fine did an excellent job of giving every single character (yes even the minor ones) a sense of actual human personality. A 10 year old boy who's running away from the circus to become a psychic agent, a sarcastic girl with the ability to talk to plants and takes no BS from anyone, a timid, socially awkward boy who was told to go to the camp because he kept blowing up people's heads with his mind, and a plethora more of quirky characters really make the game world and gameplay twice as fun and hilarious.However, another thing that Double Fine did that really gave the game some depth is the subtly. If you pay close attention to each character and their dialogue, memory vaults, and figments, you can find out some surprisingly....dark things about them. Even the main character, Razputin, mentions some pretty awful things that happened to him and his family as a child. But these little things add even more character to them, it makes them feel like they could be actual people because who hasn't had bad experiences or trauma in their lives? For a lot of the young campers, how they hint at these really tragic events is very child-like of them, like how an actual kid who can't quite comprehend those kinds of things would describe or talk about them.(You can see that I love the characters in this game right?)Moving on, the combat system is a boatload of fun, with cool abilities that are decently balanced with the gameplay. You can levitate and shoot psychic blasts of energy at your enemies, light almost every living thing on fire, and a bunch more cool things that are required to progress through different levels of the game. Speaking of the game levels, they're coloful and vary from each person's mind you enter, with different bosses and NPCs as well as the variety of different objects and missions that really tell you about the personality of the person's mentality.However, there does tend to be a bit of vagueness in certain levels where I'd get stuck because there was no clear objective or direction to what I was trying to do. At times it was more frustrating than other levels and if you've ever heard of the infamous last level of this game, the difficulty curve just spikes suddenly with how ridiculously hard and unforgiving it can be (and this version on Steam is the easier version of it!). But nonetheless, it kept me playing the game in a raging ""I'm going to beat this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ level so help me"" kind of way.I will say if you're a person who goes for 100% completion or achievements, good luck to you. There's hundreds of these things in the game called figments (like figments of one's imagination) and in some levels they're placed in ridiculously hard to find places. I'm not a person who really cares for those things as much so it never bothered me, but I can definately see how it would irritate some people who either really hate collecting.But aside from those little nitpicks and some level frustrations, I absolutely adore this game (and am currently restarting it) and would reccommend it to as many people as possible so Double Fine can come out with a sequel for it already!

Short version: 88%The cute (but dated) puzzle platformer surface of Psychonauts hides a game teeming with ideas, imagination, and great design choices (plus a not too great control scheme). A game that is worthy of all the praises it got in the past years.Long version:When Tim Schafer started his own company, Double Fine, in 2001, he was mostly known as the somewhat eccentric designer behind the greatest LucasArts adventures. So when their first title, Psychonauts, was finally released in 2005, it was a surprise to see it commercially fail despite the great reviews.Although the game eventually gained the following it deserves, it is easy to understand the initial troubles: on the surface, it looks like a typical early 2000s 3D puzzle platformer with 90s kids’ movie stereotype characters drawn as Nickelodeon figures. It took years to finally understand that its greatness lies under the hood.For starters, there is the plot. Initially, it seems like a summer camp movie about kids who have psychic powers, but as the story goes on, we learn that this movie was apparently directed by Tim Burton, as it slowly turns into a (kid-friendly) nightmare world for our brave protagonist, the somewhat clichéd sassy tough kid Rasputin.This change in atmosphere is anything but subtle, as the game world moves from a somewhat serene campground to a creepy island asylum. Both of these serve mostly as an overworld that ties together the actual levels, all set in the mindscape, the psyche of certain characters.These levels are the main reason behind the late-coming success of Psychonauts. Each offers something brand new game mechanic, ranging from simple platforming to almost point ‘n’ click levels of story-driven puzzle solving. They delve deep in the minds of a character, utilising this to its full extent to tell us an interesting, often bittersweet tale, showing us the full capabilities of the storywriting strength Double Fine could deliver.

												Many people describe this game as a ""cult classic"", but that does a disservice to a broadly appealing game that does so much right. Psychonauts, nearly a dozen years after release, remains an engaging and entertaining action-adventure 3d platformer that remains one of the funniest video games available. The graphics, while far from impressive by today's standards, have aged well because they focus on expressiveness rather than realism. The platforming, likewise, while plagued by occasional camera-angle issues, is perfectly decent.But the reasons you should play this game are the laughs and the level design. The theme of a psychic who leaps into the minds of others for each level is quite inventive, and unlike most games with inventive themes, this one backs it up with inventive gameplay. From the clean and tidy cube in the mind of the secret agent, to the twisted logic-and-gravity-defying mind of the schizophrenic, to many other hilarious worlds I hesitate to spoil but which introduce new mechanics, each level in Psychonauts feels like its own little masterwork. These are not just the same levels with new skins, or new enemies, each level in this game FEELS very different, and over a decade later I've yet to see a game with better level design.This is one of the true classics -- not just cult classics -- of PC gaming, and anyone who hasn't played it should certainly consider grabbing it during one of those times when it's on sale for a buck, such as today.

												A decent 3D platformer for children aged 1 to 92. Psychonaut's strength is its charm - you play as Raz, a psychocadet, training to be a psychonaut. Psychonauts travel through others minds - an inception-like endeavor - often helping the individual reach some closure. Adults will appreciate the intricacies - you collect mind fragments, clear mind webs, and open emotional baggage. Every mind/level is unique, a reflection of the individual's personality with each introducing interesting mechanics. Honestly, I feel like Psychonauts is an interesting piece which tries to illustrate the uniqueness of the mind. It tries to get us to take another's perspectives - to, like Raz, explore their mind.

												Psychonauts is a 3D action-platformer game originally released on Xbox and Windows in 2005. This game is probably one of the most creative and artful games ever made. In this game, you are a character named Razputin and you need to travel through people's brains in order to solve their problems and whatnot. Each brain (world) is completely different and can be pretty weird. A world takes 30 minutes to 1 hour to complete most of the time, more if you're wasting your time somewhere or trying to solve a puzzle (yes, there are a few puzzles, but they aren't very difficult and give you hints all the time). The game itself isn't super long, you can finish it within 20 hours, probably around 5 if you're replaying the game (it took me 17 hours). You also get upgrades in your journey which let you use special powers (levitation, shooting fire, etc.)This game is gold. It has great writing and some bizarre humour, excellent voice acting, beautiful environments, good character design, and an awesome soundtrack. On the negative side, the camera can get annoying sometimes and the story continuity kinda drops near the end of the game. Other than that, it's a game that you should definitely try (you can also get in on Xbox Live or the new Mac version) and that is worth every penny. I honestly wish this game got a sequel though. Awesome game, totally recommend to absolutely anyone.			"

												This game was as good as I expected it to be. I had been hearing about it for a while, and since the sequel is coming out soon, I eventually bought it ($9.99 is a good price, but if you wait until there's a sale, it usually goes for $0.99!). It's really satisfying when you're looking for a solution to a certain puzzle and you suddenly realize ""Oh! It would make sense if I used this ability!"". Should you ever feel stumped on a problem, you could always ask Ford Cruller for advice by summoning him with bacon.The writing can be really humorous at times and all the characters are very interesting in both design and personality. Don't even get me started with the G-Men in ""The Milkman Conspiracy"", They're hands down the funniest part of the game.Overall, this game was a really enjoyable experience. I'll be looking forward to the sequel when it comes out. I'm excited for the possibilities of even crazier and stranger looking characters in the future.			"

												Psychonauts truly surprised me.Having been recommended Psychonauts on a few occassions, I finally decided to give it a try. First off it has to be noted that the game is nearly a decade old, and one must remember that while dealing with the clunky graphics. But beyond that, the art style and general gameplay is wonderful. The game offers a classic platformer in a beautiful and unique visual style, that quickly goes from calm and peaceful to dark and gloomy. Initially the story starts off very much aimed towards children, but as the game progresses it becomes more about immaturity than childishness, and during certain parts of the game you might even find yourself wondering ""Who is this game actually geared towards?!"" (Spoilers: Madman stealing brains. Lots of kids burned to death. Suicidal/Sadistic/Murdering campmates. And more psychopathic nonsense.) The general story is humorous, surreal, cute, psychopathic, dark and immature, the tone of the game changes on a second's notice and takes you through dozens of surrealistic worlds, all with their unique charm and mood, much like the various characters you will meet throughout it. It is by far one of my all-time favorite Double-Fine games.			"

												Psychonauts is a third person action platformer made by Double Fine Productions following the psychic adventures in a summer camp for psychics training to be spies, as well as uncovering a camp-wide conspiracy involving psychic tanks, maniacal dentists, T.V., and milk.When I first started playing Psychonauts I was a bit dubious. A game with a cult-status which is supposedly impossible to dislike because of how stylish and funny it is--or so I was told by the legions of the internet--with a witty and incredible world populated with fun memorable characters. And milk.And It's with a strange feeling that I tell you that it's all of those things and even more. A game that genuinely impressed me even while riding on the backs of glowing reviews and flowery retrospectives. A game that made me laugh so hard that I actually had to put down the controller in order to recollect myself. A game that made me hungry yet again for things like color and style in video games, for things like inventive level design and meaningful story/level interaction, for things like interesting puzzles and fleshed out platforming. For things like milk.Delicious milk.Ignore all the praise, and meet this game on it's own terms. It's a fully realized adventure with charm and fun that makes you feel emotions of almost every spectrum even in it's modest playtime but never sacrifices gameplay or entertainment to make it's point. To say no to such an experience is absoultely brainless.			"

Even more so if its below the base price.I only disliked one level of the game, the very last level (from what I've read, I am not alone), yet the rest of the game I absolutely loved.The game does not end story-wise and so it is dependant on the sequel, which as of writing this it has not been release yet.In the Double Fine Catalog, Psychonauts is in the short list of favourite games from the Developer.

What a rush of nostalgia. Psychonauts brought me back to my childhood. To be more specific the  era where 3D plaformers (with RPG elements) became the norm for videogames. It is a refreshing, quirky, amusing, and very satisfying game overall. It also strengthens the argument that great graphics are not necessary for games to be great.Positive:- Creative, original story- Quirky art-style that perfectly fits the game- Great voice-acting- Controls are responsive and feel natural- Plenty of silly jokes- Many unique levels/worlds which force you to think differently- Fantastic difficulty curve - the game gradually expects more out of you- The game feels fair. If you die it was probably your own fault- Plenty of side quests and collectables (adds to replay value)- Levitation = wheeeeeeNegative:- As expected of most 3D plaformers: camera angles can sometimes be terrible- The mechanism for rail grinding can be awkward- There is a lot of information thrown your way when you begin. It can be overwhelming for new gamers- Not always clear what you are expected to do- Where is Psychonauts 2?!Conclusion:Well? What are you waiting for. This game is a must for anyone who has fond memories of fantastic 3D platformers. With such a low price tag there really are no excuses (especially when it goes on sale: only 1 euro!). If you are concerned about the graphics, don't be. You will have such a great time that it won't even matter. After a while you will grow to appreciate the art-style.			"

												Psychonauts has some outdated game design decisions (we are all immensely bored of collect-all-the-things), but this does not take away from the sheer depth and beauty of it as a platformer and a universe.The game Psychonauts has an intense dedication in immersing you in summer camp for psychics universe. You feel like the other children have their own quests and goals and you see them taking classes with you. It's little details like this that make Psychonauts stand out from other platformers that put all their focus in level design, and the bare minimum in immersion. On top of that, I am very impressed at the overarching theme of exploring the ""typical mind fallacy"" and in how we tend to overlook the experience and stories of children and those of different cognitive experiences. Early in the game, a child will tell a story that both the player and the teachers conclude is ""just a story"". Later in the game this ""just a story"" becomes a clear story point. And Raz is a delightful protagonist. I've never seen a game explore anxiety in its general and social forms so effectively. (I related a bit too strongly to the under-water level.)Despite various outdated game design mechanics, Psychonauts is a classic which should be played by all future game designers if only to learn how important a dedication to world immersion is and how much more satisfying a game mechanic is when it's intimately linked to story and theme.

												I had this in my library for over a year and a half before I finally finished it. I regret to not have done so much earlier, because this is truely an outstanding game. I'm really envious of the amount of creativity. There are so many details and humorous easter eggs. It's pretty lengthy as well. Much content. Lots of good!What makes this game special first and foremost is the jarring design - that makes the characters, the voices, the dialogue, the level architecture + gimmicks and naturally the humour. What I like about it is, that it takes itself serious enough to not become a total joke. It's not constantly funny and that's a good thing.I also like the structure and all the little conveniences. You have a Hub-world with multiple screens where you can free-roam to collect goodies. You have a transit system for fast travel and can get information at every moment so you never have to leave the game if you're stuck. The actual levels are in people's mind, and boy, did they make sure everyone feels unique. They are thinking out of the box more that in the box if you know what I mean. There is also a level select screen, the collective unconscious - another means to give you quick and easy control over where to go.Psychonauts is a blend of different genres. It's a 3D-Platformer but also an Action-Adventure game. These elements are served in rotation and there are long stretches where one of these takes a backseat. For example, sometimes you are significantly jumping around more and collecting stuff, Other times it's more about item management and problem solving and then there is straight-out combat. Very good pacing, both gameplay-wise and visually.And there is a lot to do... the feature list of the game mechanics are staggering. It could be tedious at some point or the other to collect all figments, say like 243 in a huge screen, but most of the time it feels very good to get everything. In some places it is a little glitchy and frustrating. You eventually get annoyed in your attempt to conquer all of it. Like, when you set the enemy on fire and he runs into you and passes in on, making you run around uncontrollably. Or when you can't get enough momentum to jump high enough off off a trampoline. Or when you're trapped in a tight space and jiggle around to get free. Yeah... be prepared for this. At that point you're probably willing to forgive more easily when the game has won you over.A little tip to prevent you from having the same start as me: As soon as you reach level 3 (from 10) you get a new mode of transport and that changes everything.Play with a gamepad!

												This game is a lot of fun, and despite being nearly 10 years old, it still holds up really well and plays great. Most of the game is fun and not frustrating (except for the second to last section of the entire game, right before the final boss; try not to punch your screen there ;) ). This may look like a kids game and may even be meant to be a kids game, but I think anyone of any age who enjoys gaming will have fun with this. The only negatives are mainly due to its age: low resolution cut-scenes are ugly, yeah the graphics and character models are a bit blocky, the invisible walls you encounter don't seem to conform to the shape of the environment, etc. And that second to last bit of the final level just before the final boss will be an exercise in frustration and anger management. But really, none of these things are bad enough to be a dealbreaker in this game. Worth getting at its usual price; absolute no-brainer when on sale. :)			"

												Very fun platformer!Graphics still hold up due to a cartoony look and every level is a different and fun experience. The writing is fantastic and has many laugh out loud moments. The game will keep you busy and interested for at least 10+ hours. My only gripes are the collecto-thon type gameplay did wear a little bit thin by the end. I have always been a big fan of games that have you collecting items, such as Banjo Kazooie, but collecting all of the items in this game is a chore, especially the holograms. Some items, such as the collectable brains, yield different story elements and are interesting. Completing the game will probably add on at least another 5-10 hours of gameplay, all be it repititive and mundane gameplay.TL;DR Very good writing and creative level. Collecting items grows repetitive, especially if trying to attain 100%. Very good game to pick up on sale.8/10			"

												Psychonauts is easily one of the most unique games available. It's the right combination of quirk, sass, eye-candy, and humor bundled with phenomenal (while corny, in several respects) storytelling and a particular sense of fervor that's difficult to come by, pertaining to character development and sentimental value in the setting.Psychonauts is a game that you can forget the world with. Sit down, relax with a controller, and immerse yourself. Definitely recommended.			"

Here is my feedback:I'm running the game on win 10 with GTX 1070, latest drive. it works fine.And the game itself is amazing! I didn't expect the classic 3d platformer was so good with level design. The control is solid and working as intended, i have no problem with a x1 controller. The concept is wild & imaginative, dialogue is funning, and all sorts of other things.			"

												It's incredible and marvelous Game! I own ""Psychonauts"" DVD-jewel with brilliant Russian localization from ""BUKA"" (it's official publisher in the Russian Federation). This title contains: elements of platformer & action-adventure, unique & uncomparable style, sea of glorious & elegant humor, many cool incornated psy-abilities. Don't be afraid cartoon graphic and usage theme of children's camp. Great humor is worth to play it. If you want to find a happy smile on your face, dive into the World of Psychonauts. This Game must necessarily be in the collection of everyone who considers himself a lover of extraordinary games. It's real father of indie for me! Heavy Indie :)			"

												First time review, so here it goes:This is a great game. No caveats or buts; it is, without question, a masterpiece.The games is about a young boy named Raz, who ran away from the circus to a summer camp to become a Psychonaut.Once there he meets many quirky and colorful characters and enters their minds to fight their inner-demons, unpack their emotional baggage, and maybe learn to set things on fire.The main strength of this title comes from its focused design. All the pieces just fit well together. The level of minds you must face, the leveling system, the odd off the wall plot, the aft for mentioned cast of characters, the music choices, and the overall sense of the game. A mix of the seemingly familiar wrapped in the trapping of the strange.Some very minor nitpicks I feel I need to add. They are by no means game breakers. In fact I encourage you to go play this game before reading this list. The game doesn't tell you can interact with as many things as you actually can. For my second play through I was using the action button on everything and finding that there's always some throwaway line or gag for nearly every object or person. The figments (one of your main collectables) are the fiddliest things to get in every level. They can range from mildly annoying, frustrating (the race), to downright impossible (waterloo world). That wouldn't be so bad if there was a way you could track down the ones you missed (you always miss one, guaranteed). But if you really want 101% you need to use the internet to track down the missing ones (itself a pain in the butt). I honestly had no problem with the Meat Circus first or second time. (The first time I did have problems with (one of) the final boss, but that was performance issues with my PC and me not configuring it properly). [Pro-tip: ignore everything in the first tent and just save the little kid and get to the top. You can come back later]One last thing I want to really highlight, is the settings of the levels. Every one of which is exploding with a creativity rarely seen in any videogame. My favorite is a toss-up between Waterloo World and The Milkman Conspiracy. (Though Lungfishoppolis comes in a close third)In the end, this is only my opinion, not everyone’s. I mean, what do you care, this game is how old now and every person on the internet has given their opinion on everything. But hear me out, even as old as it is, it is still one of the greatest video games of all time. Period. The humor, the charm, it's all there for all to see and play. The sequel is apparently coming out soon, I don't know what to think about that, but if it is half as good as the original the gaming world on the whole will be better for it. Signing off in the words of Coach Oleander that I think sum up the game quite nicely- ""You shall engage the enemy in his own mentality! You shall chase his dreams! You shall fight his demons! You shall live his nightmares. And those of you who fight well, you will find yourselves on the path to becoming international secret agents — in other words... Psychonauts! The rest of you... will die!""			"

												A crazy, creative, imaginative and fun game by the great Double Fine production company. Love the randomness of it at times and the world Double Fine created, full of humour, references, action and fun. Not too short to my taste and not too long, while some parts may seem repetitive it benefits from a rather unique humourous universe with a very fun gameplay which makes the overall gaming experience rather very positive, if you have nothing against platform games ^^. Great voice acting in French; should be equivalent in English :).			"

TL;DRBUY THIS GAME! If you have a controller, I'd recommend it over the keyboard and mouse as I've found it to be much easier to control Raz with a controller instead of the keyboard.Over a decade and the game still holds up.Psychonauts is truly a testament to great game design — released over a decade ago and still holds up well. The game features one of the most original stories this side of Spec Ops: The Line, and the humor is on-point though subtle. The characters are unique, and most importantly, human. Each one has their own problems, motivations and quirks. As the story progresses, you'll get to see characters' lives unfold, each one a different arc. I think the true achievement of Psychonaut's storytelling is that you, the protaganist, is never the main character of the story, but simply a conduit. Your actions move the story forward, but it's the lives of others that draw your attention and empathy.And my god, the level design. Instead of filling the game with gimmicky tricks that are used once (and never again, I'm looking at you Assassin's Creed, Bioshock, Dishonored, etc.), the levels in Psychonauts is designed in such a way that each ability will undoubtedly be used over and over again (except for Clairvoyence). The levels also do not feel repetitive. Even though the core mechanics never change from the first mission to the last, every mission has it's own little gimmick that makes that one particular level feel different than every other level.The soundtrack is on point, and even though the graphics undoubtedly feel a bit dated, when a game is this good, it doesn't really matter.

												One of my favorite games!  Great art, story and mechanics.  All aspects of the game have aged beautifully, and it looks better than ever.I've played it on the Playstation2, Xbox 360, and now on Steam with a synched controller.  Works great with the controller, but there are some minor issues navigating the options menu.  Easily solved if you have your keyboard handy.  The only problem I've found is that the game frequently crashing when loading levels from fast travel locations.  While inconvienent, the quick load times keep the delay to a minimum.This is the third time I've bought this game, and I'll do it again to put this on as many systems as I own.			"

												Wow! Where to begin, this game is just so incredible and so mind blowing that it's a real damn shame this is dubbed by many as ""the best game you never heard of"". This game is heavily underrated but yet it has a strong cult following. This is from the genius mind that brought us such great classics as the Monkey Island series and the ever popular PC hit Grim Fandango comes Tim Schafer's greatest creation since Brutal Legend, Psychonauts. This game has his style written all over it from the comedic story to the well balanced game play. It looks and sounds like something out of the mind of Tim Burton from the design to the music.Psychonauts is a single player experience with a well written story and tells it in a very comedic style that left me laughing throughout the entire game. You play a young boy named Raz who just arrived at camp for psychics and you experience the misadventures he goes through at his time there. Not one character is one dimensional and playing through this game you don't see that in other games. I really appreciated that and what they did with everything in the game. This is possibility the best platformer or let alone the best game I've ever had the pleasure of playing. In no way was the game hard nor was it a push over. It is well balanced and a great pick up for veteran gamers or new comers alike.I played this game on the original Xbox when it came out and playing it again reminded me how great this game is. This is my second time playing it and my first time playing it on PC. I have to say that the PC version of the game is much much better and it really shows. The graphics on it are much clearer and sharper than on console. And since this is the Steam version of the game, they added Achievements to boot. If you played it already on console, weither is was on the PS2 or Xbox, this is your second chance to play it all over again. My only gripe with the port is that the cut scenes were not optimized for PC, but that doesn't matter. It's a very good game and that is all that matters. :DI highly recommened this game for every gamer out there. This game is a solid 10/10			"

												The good -- A funny, original story with good voice acting and genuinely funny dialogue throughout. Can be childish at times, but it fits with the humor and juxtaposes well with some of the darker and more mature elements.- Great art direction, despite its age the graphics still don't look dated and fit with the look and feel of the game perfectly. The character design tends more towards cartoony characters whose appearance give you a good outline of their personality, and the environments vary widely from traditional platformer areas to mind bending levels that twist and turn through every axis.- Tight platformer mechanics, moving around and exploring the environments is easy and encouraged thanks to loads of hidden collectables. Its easy to keep track of your progress, and constantly unlocking something new, or being just about to, will keep you playing that one more level.The bad -- Occasional problems with the camera, the usual having to wrestle it under control from a preset position. Part and parcel of 3D platformers ported from consoles.- Some of the latter levels have some downright unfair sections with long runs between checkpoints and unforgiving level design that can become quite frustrating.- Optimization problems with Windows 7. There are loads of threads all over the net complaining of crashes and freeze-ups, which seem to only occur on Windows 7. True, running the game in compatibility mode (I used Windows 95) solves this issue but it seems like a glaring problem for a game on Steam, no matter how old.Personal Highlights (contains level spoilers, no storyline spoilers) -- Lungfishopolis - Destroying a city populated by fish as a giant Kaiju Theatre version of yourself. Complete with gameplay being interrupted by news flashes as the fish report on your rampage of destruction.- The Milkman Conspiracy - One of the most head bending levels I've seen in a platformer in recent times.- Razputin (the main character) is voiced brilliantly by Richard Horvitz (the voice of Invader Zim). YMMV on this one, but as a fan of the show I loved hearing the distinctive voice throughout.Summary -Won't be everyone's cup of tea, but if you like platformers and adventure games, Psychonauts is an excellent example of an original and unique take on the genre. It's fun to play, memorable in both its level design and its story, and, frankly, there's not much out there (especially recently) that compares to it. Let down by minor problems that plague many console to PC ports, but they don't hamper it enough to be a standout game.9/10Context - 9Challenge - 8Catharsis - 8			"

												One of the most unique and hilarious platformers I have ever played, Psychonauts carries on the Double Fine legacy with near perfect form. The story of Raz and his adventure in a camp for psychics is both charming and at times extremely disturbing, but from beginning to end you can really tell just how much the writers poured their hearts into each and every line.The gameplay isn't as original, falling in line with most other platformers in terms of mechanics, though the controls do leave a bit to be desired. The levels on the other hand are some of the most bizarre and interesting I've seen in any game, a few harkening back to Double Fine's adventure game roots with some clever puzzles to mix things up.Everything is brought together with a fantastic art direction. If Tim Burton and Pixar had a lovechild, it would look like Psychonauts. The music is memorable, the voice acting top notch, and overall it is simply a marvelous game that I can recommend to any fan of Double Fine or just 3D platformers in general!			"

The graphics still hold up to this day, the comedy is gold and the main character is very likeable. All the characters you meet have distinct and great personalities (especially the ones in the asylum)Want a game where you're a giant monster terrorizing a city and leading a resistance to its fearsome leader? Want a game where you're staging a play and trying to catch a mysterious masked villain who is terrorizing it?

												This is probably the textbook definition of a ""hidden gem."" In terms of story and atmosphere, the game has a level of demented charm that you really don't see a lot of any more in games, movies, or cartoons nowadays. Most of the time I found myself grinning or even laughing at some of the things the characters said. Every environment is filled with personality. Thinking about it now, the level of character that the developers have put into the game reminds me of games like Earthbound.In terms of gameplay, it's a solid 3d platformer. At first you may think that it's just another platformer, which in itself isn't a bad thing, but at the same time maybe you were wanting more. I promise, if you stick with the game, it becomes a different beast with the more psychic powers you obtain. I recommend a controller for the game, but it's still playable with a keyboard and mouse. Overall, it's a fantastic game. Aside from the short length of the game and a few audio and graphical hiccups here and there, I didn't have that many issues with it, and it's definitely worth the $10 price.			"

												I recommend this game tentatively. Pros: - Beautiful and Unique Art Style. It reminds me a bit of Invader Zim, but not so much so that I'd declare it a plain rip off. - Intricate and Masterful storytelling. The plot is interesting and keeps me coming back for more. I'm never just slogging through something hoping for a payoff. It's all a genuinely fun story.- Likable characters. Even the characters who barely get screen time or have no lines seem to be overflowing with personality. They feel very real, despite being so stylized. - Fun game mechanics. The psychic abilities are endlessly fun. Levitation is my absolute favorite, mainly because it frees up the movement of your character a lot, but there are several other abilities I really love. On top of being fun, they're necessary. Once a mechanic is introduced, they always give you a reason to use it. While you may eventually stop using it as often, it'll always come back a few more times.- Dialogue is witty and hilarious. It's not forced comedy like I see a lot of comedy games try to do. It's just funny, in a really natural way, and I found myself actually laughing out loud. Even jokes that fall flat were meant to do so, because the fact that the joke wasn't funny is part of the joke itself.- The vaults are probably my favorite part of the game. They're a sort of slide show deal, and there are usually two in every level. They're in depth explanations of certain points of that character's life, and they're a joy every time. - Bosses are challenging, but not impossible. They're all unique and just so fun. Cons: - The technology is from the PS2 era, and it shows. Some of the graphics are painfully outdated, and the pitful camera movement is a relic. You have to control the camera movement separately with your mouse, and it can tend to get frustrating during intense fights, trying to control the camera, move your character and target enemies. - Strange difficulty curve. The entire first section of the game is tutorials (understandably, considering the huge assortment of psychic abilities and mechanics they're trying to introduce) and at some point in the second half it suddenly jumps up to being extremely hard. I had to resort to a few lets plays at some parts because it was just so obtuse what you were supposed to be doing.- Figments and arrowheads were ridiculously annoying. Figments are somewhat transparent, so they tend to blend into the highly stylized backgrounds, making it almost impossible to know where they are at times. As for the arrowheads, they're practically everywhere, but at times the game demands you actively dig them up which just wasn't fun at all.- CRASHING. Good god, the crashing. At time of writing, the game has crashed at least 4 or 5 times today, which is why I'm writing this review now, hoping if I let it throw it's little tantrum for about half an hour it'll decide to work so I can continue playing. Perhaps it's just the computer I'm running it on (It's not really a gaming PC, but it is a high powered Mac) but it takes something away from the game when I'm saving every two steps in case the game decides to suddenly freeze and crash. Overall, I recommend it to anyone who wants to try something entirely new and different. It's a purely fun experience with a few technical issues that tend to drag it down at points. Despite the crashing and a few nit picky issues, I will continue playing it because I'm so invested, but if you don't think you could handle that, or don't have the patience for such a thing, I'd only recommend buying it on sale.

												Do you remember that feeling of mystery and adventure that hit you back in the days, when you took up a new game? I mean those almost new 3D adventure games with sharp shapes, a mind blowing story and infinite secrets. Oh my, how I miss those games. The were the first I played with on console and PC, and they still hold a special place in my memories. They had always original ideas, not like some everlasting sequence of sequels of today; and nobody explained to you anything (except for a basic commands tutorial), you had to figure out everything by yourself, with curiosity and intelligence, and this made the winning so satisfying. And why am I acting like an old nostalgic gamer? Because Psychonauts is such a game, and I waited way too much to play it. It showed me how much games have changed over the years, for the best and for the worst, and how much we can learn from the masterpieces of the past to craft majestic titles in our future.Now, at the end of this (first) adventure in the Psyconauts Summer Camp, I am sincerely moved, by a game that reminded me why I started to play videogames when I was a boy, and why I still play them as a man.Vi ricordate  quella sensazione di mistero e aventura che vi prendeva quando iniziavate un nuovo gioco anni fa? Mi riferisco a quei giochi di avventura in 3D, ai tempi praticamente nuovi,  con le forme aguzze, una storia incredibile e segreti infiniti. Dio, quanto mi mancano quei giochi. Sono stati i primi a cui ho giocato su console e su pc, e occupano ancora oggi un posto speciale nei miei ricordi. Avevano sempre idee originali, non come certe infinite serie di sequel di oggi; e nessuno ti spiegava nulla (se non per un tutorial sui comandi base), dovevi capire tutto da solo, con curiosità e intelligenza, e questo rendeva la vittoria molto più soddisfacente.E perché mi sto comportando come un nostalgico vecchio gamer? Perchè Psychonauts è un gioco come quelli, e ho aspettato decisamente troppo per  giocarci. Mi ha mostrato quanto i videogiochi siano cambiati in questi anni, per in meglio e in peggio, e quanto possiamo imparare dai capolavori del passato per creare titoli meravigliosi in futuro.Ora, alla fine di questa (prima) avventura al Campo Estivo per Psychonauts, sono sinceramente commosso, da un gioco che mi ha ricordato perché ho iniziato a giocare ai videogiochi da bambino, e perché ci gioco ancora da adulto.

												Psychonauts is one of those games that you overlook because of it's age. I heard nothing but good things about it but I still was not convinced. One day I decided, why not? and I never looked back... ok I looked back like 30 hours later and a few times inbetween asking myself what I'm doing with my life but that's not relevant to this review. So first off, this is a 3d action-adventure platformer with a light, fun and whacky art direction, everything about this game gives of a facade of humorus dialogue and ridiculous characters, but the underlying tale has a much darker theme going, telling the sad story of dissapointment and faliure, manifesting in insane and unstable human-beings given the shortest straw in life, this is a story about untangeling and getting to the core issue of one's mind and finding ways to overcome those issues.This game shows empathy and heart, it's funny, selfaware and it feels like every nook and crany in this game holds some sort of meaning, it's packed with collectibles and there is always something to do, I pretty much binged this game untill I had collected everything, not something I normally find compelling but this game somehow manages to keep my monkey-mind on track and for that it's easily one of the best games I've played so far, can't wait for the second Psychonauts.

												This game....its just a classic. I had to finish it twice and get most achivements before i wrote this. The game is fantastic its a true gem. It has a wierd and witty story about ""psychic"" students in a school...well more like camp. Its an action, platfromer and definitely an adventure game with great amazing graphics for its time, as well as having a slight Tim Burton look. The gameplay is also perfect and no problems with the ui as well as abilities and wepons. I enjoyed the game very much with a keybord and mouse and its very obvious it was made for a ps2 so a controler is welcome too. Now with it coming to PS4 this game should be played by anone wanting a game to laugh about, with its witty comedy and fun characters this game shouldnt be missed. Loved this game till then end and litterally played nothing else till i finished it. A well deserved 10/10!!			"

												One of my personal favourite 3D platformers! It's got sweet as powers, from running around on a levitation ball, to picking objects up with telekinesis, or even shooting psychic energy! The levels are all different and fun. Each world is based on a certain person and their ""issues and/or problems"" which ends up creating some of the most unique and various worlds that I have seen in a game. The characters in the game are also very unique and interesting too, it's a really hilarious game but at the same time, it can be very very dark. It's a really neat combination. The entire game is just filled with craziness and uniqueness. If you're a fan of 3D platformers, I defintely recommend checking this game out!			"

												This game is one hell of a trip.Like, it starts off decently normal, where you're in a strange world, at a camp. And you think to yourself, ""Huh, well this is an interesting game, sort of weird but oddly addicting too."" You expect it to be like other games that you have played. Then all of a sudden, as you continue playing, it just gets weirder and weirder, until you finally except that either you, the game, or both are insane somehow.You delve into the mind of multiple characters, learning about them, and conquering their fears or ""inner demons"", freeing them from a bigger problem.And along the way, you grow pretty attached to the main character of the story. And at the end you just sit back, staring at the main menu of the game, silently saying to yourself, ""What the hell just happened?""11/10 would play again.			"

												A game with a incredibly unique concept on the platforming genre, Psychonauts is probably one of my new favorite platformers ever. You take the place of Rasputin (which I hoped was going to be the russian leader, but whatever) who has a mysterious past that I will not spoil, as you learn about it as you go on. You end up into a camp for ""psychics,"" and unlike the other psychics, these guys are the real deal. You battle enemies by not just fighting them up front, but by going into their mind and fighting their demons. I can't wait to play more, as even the tutorial level is genius, with a general with a mind full of a whole boot camp. I never did play this game when it was released, but these graphics are still hold up very well, and the voice acting is amazing, especially the general of the camp. The only voice that was a little annoying was Rasputin's, but that might just be a personal preference. The gameplay is fun, and made me wanted to explore around the world the most I could to collect arrowheads, almost like a Banjo Kazooie game. In fact, the entire game reminds me of a remix on Banjo Kazooie, which, now that I think about it, is genius.All in all: with the sale for it being only 2 dollars, it is an absolute buy.Rating: 9.7/10			"

												Psychonauts doesn't reinvent the platformer, but it still delivers an experience that feels wholly original in every aspect of its execution.Psychonauts is a quirky, offbeat game set in a special summer camp for clairvoyant kids, in which a group of psychic children end up in a wacky adventure filled with brain-stealing hijinks, psychic secret agents, and a little romance on top of everything else. It's rooted in the sorts of 3D platforming sensibilities we've all come to know over the years. But there's a SPIN to the game--its psychic theme--which adds some cool puzzle-solving to the usual platform-jumping and swinging associated with the genre. Psychonauts also bears the unmistakable mark of designer Tim Schafer (known for classic adventure games Grim Fandango, Full Throttle, and Day of the Tentacle), thanks to a hilarious array of peculiar characters and a story that never fails to entertain. Psychonauts doesn't reinvent the platformer, but it still delivers an experience that feels wholly original in every aspect of its execution.It took four years and two publishers, but Psychonauts is finally here, and no worse for the wear, it seems.The heart and soul of Psychonauts is Razputin--or, Raz, for short--a big-headed, goggle-sporting psychic prodigy who sneaks his way into a mysterious summer camp that happens to be a training ground for the titular psychonauts, a group of psychic secret agents. Raz, it seems, has run away from his home in the circus and wants to become a psychonaut himself. Grudgingly, the counselors of the camp accept Raz into the group (albeit only for a day, until his father can come get him and take him home). However, it doesn't take long for strange things to start happening around camp. Raz, as well as other children, find that they're suffering from similar nightmares. Strange psychic interference seems to be POPPING UP all over the place, and not long after that, the brains of the other campers start disappearing, leaving the campers as soulless, TV-obsessed husks. As the hero of the story, Raz is on a mission to solve these various mysteries and uncover the crazy conspiracy behind it all.The basic plot itself reads like typical platformer fodder, but there's a lot more to Psychonauts' story than can be summed up in a single paragraph. This is largely due to the game's bizarre cast of characters, of which there are many. Raz himself is a highly likable hero; he's cute, heroic, funny, and also a little awkward at times. He fits the bill of the overenthusiastic yet not-quite-ready hero to the letter and it's hard not to feel sympathetic to his plight. But beyond Raz, there's a great supporting cast, with roughly two dozen other characters who play parts both large and small in the story. The counselors consist of Coach Oleander, an overly aggressive drill sergeant; Milla Vodello, a somewhat ditzy and party-happy go-go girl; Agent Nein, a pale-skinned, sweater-sporting scientist of indeterminate Eastern European origin; and Ford Cruller, a mysterious old man who seems to exist in about eight different places at once. These counselors join the crazy array of campers, as well as other strange people and creatures you'll encounter, to drive the storyline, and thanks to the game's excellent design, you'll have no shortage of opportunities to get ATTACHED to them.Initially, Psychonauts feels like a very open-ended game, especially because upon your first venture into the camp area, you'll find yourself able to just wander around, chatting it up with other campers or even just listening in on their completely INSANE conversations. The camp and its many areas make up a hub world, where you can access lots of different things, including a camp store, where you can buy helpful items, an underground tram that cuts down on backtracking, and all sorts of little hidden areas that yield bonus items. However, the biggest boon for the camp world is all the little bouts of dialogue you can discover. Depending on what stage of the game you're at, the conversations change up quite a bit, meaning you're not often going to hear a lot of repeats. This is great, especially because there's just so much of the dialogue. In some instances, you can literally just stand next to a pair of characters while they converse for about five minutes or longer and never hear the same line twice. And it's almost always really funny stuff.However, the most interesting aspects of Psychonauts' characters don't come from their real-world conversations, but rather from their internal monologue. As Psychonauts revolves around a bunch of psychics, the bulk of your time will be spent traversing the perils of people's minds. This is where Psychonauts truly shines. You'll be able to enter the minds of more than a dozen different characters in the game, and each mind serves as one of its main levels. Each level is completely unique. For instance, when you enter the head of Coach Oleander, you'll find a war-torn landscape filled with constant explosions, plants made out of ammunition, and, for reasons not immediately apparent, lots and lots of meat. In another example, you enter the mind of a crazed security guard named Boyd Cooper, who is utterly obsessed with nonsensical conspiracies and someone called ""The Milkman."" His mental landscape looks like a 1950s-era suburban neighborhood that's been picked up by a pair of hands, twisted into a topsy-turvy fun house, and occupied exclusively by shadowy agents in TRENCH COATS who try to convince you that they're just simple street workers, or hedge trimmers, or grieving widows, despite their obviously ulterior motives. It's all totally weird, but also undeniably unique.No two minds are exactly alike in Psychonauts, both aesthetically and in terms of gameplay. Granted, you will be spending at least some of YOUR time in each level engaging in the usual platforming shenanigans, like jumping and double-jumping over platforms, swinging from poles, walking tightropes, and so on. When the game is in full-on platformer mode, it plays very well. The controls are tight, the camera is rarely ever a problem, and it's generally pretty easy to get Raz around without screwing up, at least on the Xbox. The PC version controls well enough too, provided of course you have a good USB controller, as the keyboard and mouse controls just don't feel right for this type of game (and even with a USB controller, camera control can be a bit of a pain). If there's any one criticism to be mounted here across both platforms, it's that the game is rarely ever that difficult, save for a few specific parts that are actually quite tough. You can't call the game a total breeze, either, but most experienced players shouldn't have any problems mastering the basic play mechanics pretty quickly.The inside of a person's mind can be a pretty crazy place.Even though the game isn't particularly hard, at least it's not repetitive. The goals and challenges of each level are totally exclusive. In one level, you'll find yourself playing a bizarre board game against a mental projection of Napoleon Bonaparte. You'll shrink down to ""fun size"" to recruit new pieces to YOUR cause, and then you'll return to your normal size so that you can move them around. In another level, you're fighting neon-tinted luchadores and a big, hulking bull in what looks like a velvet painting of a congested Spanish city. It's with this kind of variety that Psychonauts manages to achieve its high level of quality.It also helps that the game has more to it than just a lot of jumping around. There are puzzles to be solved in Psychonauts, as well as battles to be fought, and both require use of Raz's list of crazy psychic powers. You start out only with a basic melee attack at your disposal, but as you play and collect items scattered about both the real world and mental worlds, you'll be able to upgrade Raz's rank and earn new powers, like telekinesis. 84/100			"

												With the new Psychonauts game on the way, I felt I needed to make a review for the first one. Let me start off by saying that if you have not already played this game, you are missing out. It is an absolute classic from one of my favorite developers, Double Fine. (And the man behind it all: Tim Schafer)The game itself is filled with great humor, amazing level design, eccentric characters, a villain's ridiculous plot to take over the world, and a mysterious milkman. (Play the game to see what I am talking about) The creativity of the developers is astounding and I found myself actually wanting to come back to all the levels to collect every little thing the developers put in there. All the levels have their own charm to them and the premise of the game really allows for some of the most memorable levels I have ever had the joy to play through. And honestly, I am extremely excited now that we are finally going to get a continuation of the story in the new game they are developing. I really hope it will be good, but even if it isn't, I still think people should pick this game up and play through it. In my opinion, it is well worth the $10 asking price, but if you still don't want to pay that much, then make a note to pick it up during a sale. Pros- Great Characters- Humorous story- Amazing levels- Interesting premise- Psychic Powers- MilkmanCons- Collecting all the figments can be annoying sometimes. (Only a problem for completionists)- Some minor bugs- It ends. :(Overall, I highly recommend this game. It's worth the price and Double Fine really produced a great game. Personal Score: 9/10			"

												This sure is a great game, one of the lastest masterpieces coming from Tim Schafer.It's really sad it's really underrated in some points or in general.Why is this so great, you say? (or not, i'm going to say it anyways), it's totally fun, and really really creative, its fun to play and to progress, funny dialogues, bizarre moments and characters, sometimes you'll get some sad backstory coming from every character.Also, to keep in mind this: It's not a kids game. Neither +5, neither +10 or +13, despite the art, it has a lot of humour and dialogues that can be only taken serious or get a pun from the game if you're Teen/Adult, sure, a kid can play the game, but only to play, and follow some cliché things from every story of this kind.Now like every game, there is no perfection whatsoever. By this i mean, there are some bugs or mechanisms that are quite annoying in some point in the gameplay, sometimes you'll fall down, sometimes you won't grab a ledge, usually you'll touch A LOT of invisible walls, and there are some puzzles that are quite overthinked, or the only way to get the puzzle right it's going with the trial-n-error method, WHICH can take a lot of time and it will turn to be a bit boring, but once you get that right you'll feel really good.Characters are sure as hell NOT forgettable, they are distinguishable and special, really creative ways to play and make a nice but simple plot.In terms of port, you'll suffer some FPS drops in the mean time but they are really random, unless, of course, you use a FPS-locker program, because it lacks of FPS lock, so you will probably get 40 fps and then 80 fps but then 20 fps.Also, one more thing, it also lacks of controller support, but thanks to the internet, you'll get that done boy, with this guide

Also when you are in Rasputin's mind and you have to go to the top of the tower and then all of a sudin you need to get your levitation power.-Near the end of the game, there's no way to go back to the hub world, so if you wanted to go back and get everything to get rank 101, you'll have to start the game all over again.Overall Psychonauts is a fantastic game 9.5/10			"

												Such an imaginative concept that's explored so well. A lot of variety in the gameplay, with radically different scenarios and many powers and types of movements you can use. Hilarious dialogue, charming characters, so much attention to detail (every NPC has dozens and sometimes hundreds of responses and the artistry of some of the locations is astonishing), and lots of collectibles which you are well rewarded for. Clearly made with a lot of love, and you'll fall in love with it too.Runs well even on an old PC. There are a few moments where the platforming can get tricky, but the whole game can be done even on a keyboard. Even if you don't care for platformers, make an exception for this one, because this game gives you so much.			"

												Double Fine make some really good games, this being one of the best in my opinion, the trailer for this game really doesn’t do it justice and I’ve noticed that in a few double fine games to be honest. They don't usually show off the game for what it really is, nor show its true potential. Just from the trailer, I didn't think this was something I would ever play, but I got it in a bundle and it’s actually an amazing game.Like any good game, some parts can be frustrating, but it’s all part of the fun. Because it wasn’t the kind of frustration for me that made me want to give up, more so the kind you want to keep trying again, and then when you do succeed, you feel like you've accomplished something. The story is quite quirky and fun, the dialog can be really humorous at times as well, at least to me. You can definitely tell the creative team of double fine are behind it, there is fun characters to interact with and fun little stories to unfold behind each one. Also, there is a lot of collectables and little Easter eggs to find in the game. It’s not one of those games that it seems like a chore to do, for me it was actually fun. But then again, I do like my collectables in games.All in all, I think it’s an amazing game, it’s definitely worth buying, if I didn't get it in a bundle, I would very happily of spent the money on it knowing now how good it is. I even liked it so much as to go back after my first play through and complete it 100%, achievements and all. Which took around 2 and a half playthroughs, it was a lot of fun. Even though I’ve finished it, I can still see myself going back and playing it again in the future. It’s a very enjoyable game, and I’m glad that I did end up playing it, despite what the trailer made me originally think.			"

												This is what I think can be called a modern day classic game. The world the game creates feels like something that they really put a lot of thought into with characters that absolutely fit in and interact in charming and very interesting ways. When I remember this game, I remember it in the same way I do a good movie or book. It has that strong of a unifying theme and directed narrative experience, except you can actually play it. The gameplay and mechanics are some of the least memorable parts of this to me because they just feel so natural to the story they're going for. And I think of that as a good thing.			"

												Psychonauts is more than just nostalgia, it's an adventure! It brings me back to games being $30 a pop, and aimed towards style rather than realism. This is a perfect example of a memorable old game. Like many, it's been forgotten over time. I never even played it till i saw it on steam! (mostly because I could never find a copy) But seriously:The art is fantastic, I really love the detail put into the character models and the different stylizations of each level. The voice acting is pretty great, I especially love Raz and Lili's. The story's fantastic! It has it's comedy elements, over all a nice little story, but if you search deep enough you can find a few deep dark secrets... The gameplay is solid, I rarely had issues.The only problem I can say with the game is that sometimes Figments are hard to spot. Figments aren't required to complete the game, but they're more so a treasure hunt item so it doesn't matter unless you want to 100% the game. Either way I think you'll enjoy it even if you have to go figment hunting!			"

												Psychonauts is honestly my favorite game - you really can't find games like this anymore. The humor is woven into the game, the characters are so intricate and likeable, and the story is entirely it's own and executed so well. The worlds you explore in this game are all so distinctly their own and creatively made. You can tell that lots of love and work got put into this project, and it has that 2000's feel that gets the nostalgia going. I will admit that at times the controls and camera can be more of a frustration than a feature, but for most of the game they work just fine. Achievement hunters should go into the game wary, as finding every figment is beyong annoying and the only aspect of this game that has ever actually frustrated me. If you can get past those couple little things, though, this game is so genuine and not afraid to be itself that it's well worth the time and money.			"

This is tim burton meets boy scouts, meets psychic powers. It is not only a great platformer, but a great adventure. I am so excited for the sequel that this game has deserved for the longest time. If you had not had the oppurtunity to play this game, Dont let anything hold you back, Become A Psychonaut!			"

												I would've never bought this by seeing the gameplay or trailer alone. Thank god I got it as a gift. I was basically raised by collect-a-thon platformers, so I don't mind these types of games. Apart from that, the game is really good. I enjoyed it a lot.

												Doing this for the badge, but a really great platformer. If you're a fan of games like Banjo Kazooie and Super Mario 64, then you might like to give Psychonauts a try. Definitely very unique in its story and characters, lot of fun to just explore and get immersed in. Double Fine did a damn good job putting together a great game. It's usually on sale a lot/part of humble indie bundle deals, so don't let the price be the reason you don't play.			"

												I'm just gonna go ahead and call this game a ""classic"", ""must-play"".So, the idea is your character has different 'psychic' powers. The most basic one is double-jumping, and you gradually learn many other ones (some examples are shooting, moving stuff with your mind, burning stuff, seeing things how others' see them). They are complemented with various items, gadgets. All these are used in battle, but, more importantly, for solving puzzles, which will surprise you with their originality. If you pay attention, you will notice hints subtly hidden in what the characters say. And if you need more help, you can always call your scizophrenic mentor using a piece of bacon... yeah.There is also a lot of acrobatics involved. Jumping, floating, various interactions with platforms, poles, ropes, ledges, etc.A lot of stuff is frankly weird (and may creep you out if you're very sensitive), because often the action takes place inside other characters' imagination (many of them crazy, like in the asylum where you help the patients overcome their problems). Sometimes space/gravity is bent, which is also a nice addition to gameplay.All the levels are different and unique in some way.The story takes about 15 hours. And that's the minimal amount of time you will need to complete it (at least if you're not intentionally going as quick as possible). There is tons of content. Because there is a concept similar to ""experience"" and ""levels"" (which only let you unlock more powers - nothing like the usual RPGs), you can go at your own pace and complete as many side quests (which are usually tied to exploration of the game world) as you want. There is almost no grinding involved.★★★★★★★★★☆			"

												It has action, humor, and an enthralling story. It's an adventure game like no other featuring children soldiers. It's none other than Psychonauts. You play as Razputin, or Raz for short, who has a dream to become a Psychonaut, a psychic soldier who protects to the world,  before his parents can pick him up from Psychonaut training camp. As he ventures through the camp grounds completing task for his councilors, he stumbles upon something that could mean the end of the world. Through many obstacles and enemies, you must find a way to stop this calamity from happening all before you are picked up from camp. A game of this stature deserves much more praise than what it has received. Tim Schafer did an excellent job on creating a spell bounding game that captures your interest within seconds. A cult-classic in gaming that needs to be played.			"

												One of my favorite games of all-time, and definitely my favorite Double Fine game. Psychonauts is a bundle of joy and love.There is nothing I dislike about this game, at all. I used to play a lot of funny platforming game years and years ago, but don't as much now. I loved playing things like Crash Bandicoot or, going back further generations, to things like Earthworm Jim. When it comes to weird humor though, Psychonauts is probably the top.The story of Psychonauts starts out simple but gets significantly more involved as it goes along, getting decently complex as things actually become a mystery. But the way of solving the puzzles is the best. Delving into the minds of different characters along the way, using their thoughts as levels, is awesome. Each stage in the game is so unique and interesting that I will replay them all forever. All of the characters are so interesting and have their own ticks, and the graphics and sounds (including voice acting) are so well-done. Nothing is wrong at all with the design.Raz, your character, gets interesting power-ups along the way, making exploration fun and opening up random puzzles. Finding the easter eggs in the levels is fun, from the basic collectibles (enabling you to buy upgrades) to especially the memories. The most stand-out ones for me are in Milla's mind, but just about all of them are rewarding in some way.The platforming itself is clean and not too frustrating, though some levels take a bit of adjusting to, such as the angles in the Milkman stage. And exploring outside of the levels is just as fun because Double Fine developed the world with lots of detail. Wandering around and finding some little incidental cutscene is great, especially since nearly everything in the game is really funny and off-the-wall.If you don't find the game's sense of humor enjoyable, then that's a shame. But I have to say that this game is one of the most enjoyable experiences I have ever had. Go play it, now!			"

												TL;DR: A great story with good gameplay. I recommend you play it, but SPECIFICALLY on Windows, with an Xbox 360 Controller, and with the Psychopad mod.Psychonauts was the first game that I ever bought (with money) on my Steam account. After hearing good reviews (such as the one from Yahtzee on Zero Punctuation), I had decided to pick it up. In the end, I'd consider it one of my favorite games of all time.The core gameplay actually feels a lot like a 3D Mario game. It's a 3rd Person 3D Platformer with some fairly intricate platforming. This difficulty is a little on the tough side, but it never really feels vicious other than the last level of the game. The game gives you a double jump from the beginning of the game, which makes the platforming a bit easier, and about a third of the way through the game, it gives you an ability that allows you to fall slower, which makes some of the later-game platforming more bearable. Your main attack is a punch that has a fairly large range. You also gain abilities as you progress though the game that allow you to attack from more of a distance. For these abilities, the game gives you a lock-on system that is very similar to Zelda's Z-Targeting. This usually works well, but can get frustrating at times when there are a lot of enemies on the screen at once.The level design in this game is excellent. The story behind the levels is that you are entering the minds of different characters, so each level is designed to represent that character's psyche. Because all of the characters you enter the minds of are well characterized, each level is itself a strong representation of the characters. The most interesting levels are correlated to the most interesting characters, with Boyd's level being particularly famous. There are hidden memory vaults, along with scripted events and cutscenes in the levels that help to further characterize the people who's minds you enter, helping to create a better overall connection between the levels you play in and the story that moves the game along.The story in the game is fantastic. You play a psychic boy named Raz who runs away from home (which happens to be a circus), to sneak into a summer camp that trains psychic kids to try to make them ""psychic secret agents"" called psychonauts. He discovers a conspiracy that threatens the entire camp, and it's up to Raz to save the camp. All the characters that you meet in the game are all well characterized, and makes the story much more interesting. The game has a lot of humor in it, and Double Fine has done a good job of making sure the jokes actually work. Psychonauts is one of the funniest games I've ever played.One aspect of the game that I didn't really like was the leveling system. There are a number of collectables scattered throughout the game (both in the levels and the overworked) that increase your level, and leveling up gives you a few required abilities (for the first few level tiers), then upgrades your existing abilities. Some of these upgrades actually makes the game a LOT easier, meaning that if you don't go out of your way to find these collectables, the game can be much more difficult. However, replaying the game to get 100% of the collectables is a lot of fun. Once you complete the story once, it's a lot of fun to restart the game and aim to get 100% of the collectables and achievements.This game can be downloaded for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux, but the later two ports are actually pretty broken. I played the Mac version first, and I experienced serious performance issues, multiple graphics issues, and crashes. From what I've heard, the linux version doesn't fair much better than the Mac version. While the Windows version isn't perfect, it is certainly better than the other two. You can try to get it to run under Wine, but I can't make any promises about how well that will work.The keyboard+mouse controls for this game really suck. The game was designed around a controller, so you should play it with one. I recommend the 360 controller because the game has controller mapping and vibration support for it. If you have a wireless 360 controller already, just get a cheap Chinese knock-off of the wireless receiver (I can find them for around $10 USD) and force Windows to use the official drivers for it in the Device Manager. The game won't have the button prompts for the controller unless you use the Psychopad mod to add them. Be sure to turn off Steam Cloud Sync before running the patcher though, or the controls may be remapped in such a way to prevent the button prompts from appearing.In the end, I'd recommend this game. I consider this game to be one of my favorite games of all time, and for good reason. It's gameplay is fun, it's story is amazing, and I will always enjoy going back and replaying the game. If you haven't played this game, then you should play it.			"

												I played ""Psychonauts"" only now, 10 years after it's been released. And the game holds up very well.This game is a third-person action/platformer with a very strong storyline. You are a boy who wants to become a psychonaut, a secret agent, who has powerfull psychic abilities and can get into the minds of other beings. At the beginning you can't do much, but throughout the game you will become more and more skilled.The graphics is very good and doesn't look old at all. I love the design of levels and characters: very colorful and cartoony.The controls are pretty comfortable. Platformer part of the game is well made. It's satisfying to even just jump around, exploring the world, gathering figments and arrowheads, finding secret bonuses.The game is greatly varied and doesn't let you become bored. All 15 hours that I played, I faced new challenges, interesting plot turns and memorable characters.			"

COMBINATION! The Ok Stuff=The shop where you have to buy items to proceed in the game is nice, but also a pain since you have to collect arrowheads.

												Exploring the minds of other campers was so entertaining that I feel it made this game worth it in spite of the near constant crashing issues that seem to plague a segment of the playerbase and the other negatives I'll get to.Pros:-Each level feels distitinct from the others and no one level is ""that level"" that I hated to play-Story pacing is adequate, I felt introduced to new plot points often enough to remain interested-The characters are fleshed out enough that the player can dig into their pasts and motivations through dialog or power  interactions (claravoiyance lets you see how they view you, for example)-The story was coherent and had a satsifiying conclusion and the main characters exhibited growth as charactersCons:-The player is rewarded with additional powers or upgrades by collecting a large number of collectables but the upgrades feel largely useless and the entire game could be beaten easily while ignoring the collectables-The Confusion grenade power was shoehorned in for one mini-boss and one boss fight in the same level and then has no effect on any enemies following that point.-There is a story-related point where the player recieves the Levitation power but subsequent levels are not designed around its use and it utterly removes all platforming from the game.-Constant crashing. This is only alleviated by the game autosaving at every loading screen so the player loses no progress.-The arrowhead currency is mostly useless except the two times the player is forced to hunt for them to buy an item in order to progress with the game. One of these two items is a dousing rod that only helps find more arrowheads to save up for the more expensive plot-related item.Again, even with the near-useless upgrades and powers, the forced hunting of arrowheads, and constant crashing Psychonauts is worth a play. The characters are interesting, the story is satsifying and not even a slightly lackluster platforming experience can detract from that.			"

												This game makes me miss my PS2. This 3D puzzle platformer from Double fine is joyous, the controls are tight, the combat is fun, and the art is good. This game took a decent amount of time to finish, considering it's price, and had fantastic writing. A controller is highly recommended, as there are some precision platforming segments that can be difficult to do with only the eight digital WSAD directions. My only main gripes with this game is that some checkpoints can be placed in quite sadistic places, like near an enemy, and sometimes the camera will move itself into awkward angles. I totally recommend this for anyone who likes a good 3D platformer, even those with potatoes can run this game at lower settings too.			"

												Great game because its feels like an old school nostalgic game. Also the characters are pretty likable, something that is very cool since it's becoming hard to find this type of characters in videogames. It remembered me a lot to Rayman 2, even when both games are kinda different, it made me feel the same good sensation.Artistically the game is beautiful and imaginative, and the majority of the levels are pretty good original and well designed.The OST is also nice, I liked to go around the camp listening to the same tune again and again. It never bored me.It took me 21 hours to get 100%, including all achievements, so probably the average would be like 15 hours.It plays fine on modern PCs, so don't worry for compatibility problems. Still, I remeber I had two crashes.			"

												This game ranks in my top 20 favorite games of all time. While the ""graphics"" would initially strike most as outdated, what this game lacks in pixels it makes up for 100 fold in brilliant dialoge, character and level design, humor, tight, fun controls and a plot that finally finds a breath of fresh air amongst all the cliches plaguing games right now.The creators of this game - while once well regarded in the videogame community - are now at the butt end of quite a lot of bad press; however this game is the one that I personally believe to be their aboslute treasures. It really takes me back to the days when platforming adventure games like Banjo Kazooie and Super Mario 64 reigned supreme. There are not enough good things I can say about this title. If you've never played it, then you owe it to yourself to pick up a copy asap and let your mind delve into the world of Psychonauts.			"

												If this game has anything, it's style. Each level takes place within the psyche of a character. The level design in themselves are just tons of fun to play, vibrant, and creative, but if you dive even deeper into Psychonauts, you can find so much more. Each character however subtley has their own incredibly unique story to tell. Take the time to piece these stories together.			"

 Positive + Expertly crafted story and writing in general; with entertaining and unique characters, as well as intelligent dialogue/humour that very few games can match+ Some very bizarre imagery, with an interesting art style+ Wide variety of gameplay styles: with the various PSI abilities, and some of the best 3D platforming in the industry; the level design especially is both imaginative and memorable+ Clocking in at around 10 hours of playtime (many more if you wish to collect all of the various collectibles), the game is lengthy and doesn’t drag on for too long nor feel too short. Negative - Occasionally the camera can be a little awkward, especially when it comes to the platforming, making missed jumps a little irritating, as well as the targeting system being a little iffy at times- Somewhat inconsistent difficulty curve: though for the most part the game is relatively easy, some parts may take a few more tries to beat than expected. Verdict “Put simply, one of the most memorable and fun games I’ve ever played. Unfortunately, the game sold fairly poor on release, so a sequel to this game ever being created is unlikely, which makes the ending even more bittersweet. But don’t let that put you off from playing this witty masterpiece of a game. You will not regret it.” 9/10 TJBs  "

												I'm really glad I finally got around to playing and beating this game. It was easily the best game I've played in recent years. It's genuinely funny and unique and I don't think there's a game QUITE like this out there. I enjoyed this game the entire time I played it. Decent legnth and it never over-stayed its welcome, very nicely paced overall. The dialog especially was some of the best stuff I've seen since Jak/Ratchet.The art style, while very unique, is a bit dated these days. If you can get past that it looks pretty good.I can only hope that someday soon Tim Schafer will get the money and inspiration to make the sequel it so deserves. Maybe one day....			"

												What a surprise this game was for me. I didn't get to play it when it first came out on PS2 and I can happily say this game has aged well. It has a very diverse cast with each character having distinct a look and personality. The main character is fun to play with with many abilities to enhance his already well established zany personality. Level designed is colorful, flavorful and just plain fun!I highly recommend this title, specially if you are a fun of third person action/adventure platformers like super mario 64, legend of zelda: ocarina of time and rayman.

												This is my backstory to the game, and not a discussion about the actual contents of the game. I wouldn't want to ruin this game for anybody.I was initially introduced to gaming by my father, who played Call of Duty competitively with his clan. He made sure to pick up a copy of the local gaming magazine, which was flourishing at the time, and brought it home. Every copy came with a disk which contained images, music, and game demos. One day, he showed me the demo for a game which very quickly caught my eye. I played this demo over, and over, doing everything possible without cheating to achieve everything one possibly could in the area given to you within this short game demonstration. One day, the game disappeared from my thoughts, and I completely forgot about it, and moved on with my life. Then, one day, I was browsing the Steam Store, and stumbled upon a game by the name of ""Psychonauts"". The title sounded incredibly familiar, so I went to the Store page of the game, and observed the video. It struck a sense of nostalgia inside of me, and this feeling caused me to buy the game. After waiting for it to install, I started it up. This was it, I realized.The full game of the demo which I had so readily devoured when I was but a wee spawn.This game doesn't reinvent the platforming concept, yet still delivers an experience which feels completely original in every possible sense of the word.Pros: Unique concept, beautifully bizarre art-style, great voice acting, phenomenal use of comedy, original and challenging puzzles.Cons: The game does provide some issues. The puzzles, whilst being original and challenging, can also present a certain sense of frustration at the sometimes sheer amount of abstract thinking one is required to do. If you aren't willing to sit down and invest 2+ hours when you start playing it during the day, afternoon, or evening, you'll miss out on a large part of the experience.Overall, a superb concept, amazingly executed. Psychonauts doesn't reinvent the platformer genre, but makes every aspect of it completely unique to the game.Worth every cent. I eagerly await the sequel.9.3/10			"

												Your name is Razputin! But everyone calls you Raz.As your main character, circus-acrobat-turned-psychic-trainee, introduces himself to the others of the Whispering Rock Summer Camp, you begin to know you're in for something special. Welcome to the dark, humorous, and engaging world of Psychonauts.You play as the acrobatic, mentally powerful 10-year-old boy named Razputin, who runs away from his home at the circus to join an elite group of specialized secret agents, the Psychonauts, at their top-secret training facility (which happens to be disguised as a summer camp). There, he more-or-less joins with the other campers to train to one day become a Psychonaut agent. However, when his newfound friends' brains begin to go missing, it's up to Rasputin to locate the mysteriously misplaced cranial matter!The game, for the most part, is a 3D Platformer, but with an interesting take on the genre: You have access to a variety of psychic powers, from clairvoiyance to levitation to telekinesis and everything in between. This allows for a wide variety of challenges within the game, with different approaches to a problem being given (for example, whether to TK a nearby object into an enemy group, or to use Pyrokinesis to set a bombling alight).As the game's levels revolve around entering people's minds to help them solve a problem, the game's several stages are eccentric and often times fantastical, and almost always reflect their person's psychological state of mind; one character with bipolar mood swings has, inside their mind (which is set up like a theater, complete with actors playing the person's memorys), a lamp with a smiling face on one side, and a sorrowful one on the other, and when activated, will distort the memories to reflect the given emoton. One of the levels, Black Velvetopia, holds a special place in this review, for it's excellent backstory, smart level design, beautiful art style, and superb emotional allegory.Even though this may be a game from 2005, the graphic and music still stand out as some of the more strange and original of their kind. The level design is well done, keeping the game familiar yet fresh. The final level seems mostly based around parkour, and grows a tad tedious in the end. Despite this, it is still a great level, and the better parts of the stage outweigh the disappointments. The final boss, however, feels underwhelming, no matter how freaking cool it is.Overall, Psychonauts is a game that will keep you on the edge of your seat, laughing all the way.

												It's a tragedy that there are not more games like this.Psychonauts is a 3rd-person 3D platformer which puts you in the shoes of Raz, a psychic prodigy who ran away from his circus family to join a summer camp for Psychics, in training to become Psychonauts.Psychonauts has you enter the minds of all sorts of different people and experience their inner psyche up close and personal. As you can imagine, this leads to some interesting visual design choices and a lot of laughs to boot.The gameplay is solid, Raz handles pretty well. One downside is that you can only have 3 abilities mapped to buttons at any one time and so you will be switching these constantly depending on the situation. Most of the game has you running around in peoples heads, collecting items and avoiding hazards.The graphics look dated, as they should do. It was an old game and a console port as well. It still holds up well, though, thanks to the great art direction, fluid animations and colorful environments. The audio is also fantastic, it has a great soundtrack and some excellent voice talent.This is a must-have if you're a PC gamer.			"

												Sometimes Double Fine just knocks it out of the park. Psychonauts is an endearing adventure/platforming game that is jam packed with style and charm. You play as Raz a young Psychonaut wannabe who runs away from home to pursue his ""dreams"" (see what I did there) at Camp Whispering Rock. Raz's ability to penetrate the minds of others creates for a varied and wild experience as each platforming level offers it own unique flavor. My only complaint is that cccassionally the ""cute"" is broken when Raz gets a bit off-color in his commentary towards the end of the game ... oh, and that they haven't developed a psyquel yet. As fun now as it was when I played it back on the original XBox.  I highly recommend this game.			"

												An amazing story, very fun, lots of puzzles and bits to collect. One of my favourite games. Really great, huge variety of things to do. The first PONR is fine and can be reversed but there is a second less well-known one that drove me mad at the end of the Meat Circus, which stops me from playing the last level again so I'm stuck super close to 100%. This enraged me as a completionist. But if you don't plan on 100%ing, play it, it's great fun.			"

												Bias: I am a dino. I like to dream I have super psychic powers.Review long time coming. One of the first games I got on steam. If you have not played this game. You shouldQuirky, funny, and involves a lot of brain stealing shenanigans. Totally worth playing this. To be honest, I have enjoyed all the Double Fine titles I have played - This one led to me playing Brutal Legend and Costume Quest. Your quest is to allow the power of your untapped mind to save the kids of Whispering Rock from having their minds stolen and used by the mad man. This is a fun puzzle platformer with a lot of imagination and creativity. A lot of interesting backgrounds and imagery to suck you into the world of psychic powers. It was an enjoyable experience solving puzzles and fight bosses throughout the gameI do hope a sequel is released. It would definitely go to the top of my to play list.10/10 from me. Though the game is from 2005, it is still enjoyable and quite playable. With strong story, good puzzles, and fun boss fights.			"

VERDICT:Buy Immediately (9.8/10)Completion Time: 25-30 hoursBottom Line: ""Don't just play this game for the memorable story, the characters, or the adventure, JUST DO IT FOR THE KIDS MAN.""PROS+Awesome story+Suprisingly mature humor+Winning gameplay formula+Hilarious characters+Unique worldCONS-You will sometimes get lost-Platforming difficultiesREVIEWThis is an adult's game disguised in XS kids clothing. On the outside, this is a game about a children's day camp, but venture a little deeper and you'll find one of the most quarky, hilarious, and enthralling adventures that successfully stands the test of time.Our hero is Rasputin (AKA Raz), a young boy that runs away from his job at the circus in order to hone his supernatural abilities at a day camp for young psychics. It only takes a day for him to realize that something is terribly wrong: some of the campers are starting to literally lose their minds. It is your job to not only become an official psychic expert, but to find the culprit behind the missing brains!This is your traditional adventure-platformer in the same vain as Mario 64 or the Spyro franchise. You'll be running around completing tasks for different camp patrons to advance the story, all while traversing terrain and taking down baddies.Let me just say that this cast of characters is one of the most endearingly dysfunctional groups of people you'll ever meet. From delusional old men to stereotypical FBI agents to a bully with a lisp, all the classic stereotypes are in full force here.Gameplay is split into two different zones: free roam and brain sequences. During free roam you can roam the camp grounds searching for collectables and meeting new people. Brain sequences take place inside your brain and involve whimsical levels reminiscent of a bad dream, or someone that's tripping really hard. Everything in this game, regardless of location, has the same distinct art style, and this is the type of style that doesn't age with time.The gameplay itself is incredibly fun. Throughout the game you'll be gaining new abilities to take on your foes. These include telekenesis, levetation, invisibility, and more. Each ability has its purpose, and will come into play at some point in the game. There are also many puzzle aspects of gameplay, and these puzzles are damn fun. My favorite puzzle was when I had to play a game of Catan (not actually Catan but something similar) in order to defeat a boss. It was one of the coolest levels I have ever played.The cons are few and in between. Sometimes I got lost in this game, and it was unclear where I needed to go to advance the story. Also, some platforming sections were frustrating, or it wasn't necessarily obvious what I had to do to advance in the level. Regardless of these hiccups, I always managed to find my way eventually.If there's one thing I want you to take away from this review its this: this game is memorable. Each level is incredibly unique. Each character is different and has their own idiosycracies that make them hilarious. Each boss fight has different mechanics that make you think. And the last level is a tremendous challenge that makes you feel like you've accomplished something monumental upon its completion.Don't just play this game for the memorable story, the characters, or the adventure, JUST DO IT FOR THE KIDS MAN.

Inside Someone's MindStory:You take the Role of Raz, who just escaped the life of a circus performer to join a summer camp for children with Psychic abilities, with an unreasonable goal of becoming a Psychonaut in just mere days.Fortunately for Raz or perhaps not. This once peaceful learning camp is now in danger, as kids seem to be turning into TV obsessed Zombies.Its now up to him with the help of his teachers to uncover the culprit.The concept of going inside someone's mind,is what makes this game so appealing to me.You jump between the real world/hub world, a safe and familiar place, to this fantastic sets, showing the mind's representation of each characters fears.Its a great idea, with endless possibilities and Double Fine did good use of it. Every character as their own very distinct personalities and painful memories, each have their own unique mental world.As to what you should expect from the story in this gamePsychonauts started as a turned down idea for Full Throttle, and was the first title for Tim Schafer´s own company, Double Fine.This is what most people used to remember Shafer for, it's a Multi-layered narrative with alot of his own humor and charmGraphics:Psychonauts was never a good looking game, but the strong art style makes up for it in a way.If you ever watched animation around the 90´s, you probably noticed what Psychonauts is going for. All of these characters are human but with desproporcional bodies, sometimes hard to even recognize them as such.That art style extends to the sets themselves and everything fits perfectly togetherGameplay:Not cluttered but a bit all overFrom old school platformers to collectathons, Speed sections on rails and puzzle elements, bosses, fetch-questsyou name it.I will say it, i loved this game, but its hardly a fully fledged platformer, in the later levels it even gets a bit frustrating, calculating and timing your jump, is not always easy, thanks to flawed gameplay mechanicsTLTR?Pros:+Story+art style +Original concept+Variety+Strong characters+Voice acting+Humor+Music (sounds like Danny Elfman)Cons:-Textures-Platforming mechanics -Randomly crashes (not often, +with autosaves it's unlikely to lose progress)Score: 4/5 "

												Let me just start off with saying, that i LOVE this game. I have played it through 4 times now and i recently picked it up on steam and 100% completed the game. The story is very interesting and somewhat original. A lot of people say, that the game hasn't aged well, but the cartoony and sometimes dodgy graphics somehow appeal to me more than modern games. I do agree, that the controls are a bit akward without a contoler, but you can get used to them. The most important aspect about this game to me is that it scratches an itch... The countles collectibles are not obligatory to collect, but the ranking sistem makes them very rewarding. The feeling that you get after collecting every figment in a level is great and you feel like you have achieved something. (figments are one of the collectible and often hard to notice 2D models that make levels look full and colorfull)Lastly i want to talk about the music. In my oppinion it is very well made and fits in the rather bizzare world of the game very well. I was very happy when i had the chance to get the official sountracks from the Humble Bundle.This game is a lovely little gem from the 2005 and it's well worth its price.

												One of the most unique games ever created. In fact, it's more than a game, it's a piece of art. The worlds inside the minds of the characters are mind-blowing, the dialogs are hilarious, the plot is cleverly constructed, and bacon is a beacon. The only thing I didn't like in this game is that most of the characters were designed by 2D artists, and although they look great in the drawings, they look very bad in 3D (see e.g. Crystal and Clem). The last level is not as hard as its reputation suggests, especially since they made it much more forgiving in the Steam version than it is in the GOG version (that one is so old, it still has the Majesco logo).

												In my whole gaming career I've never played a game that was as unique as Psychnonauts. Although the game is quite old by now the graphics stayed very appealing because of the awesome cartoony style. You will fall in love with it from the very beginning. Although it is a platformer the game tells a beautiful story with some really nice twists and is full with very creative and diverse characters you won't forget. They are so charming that they will find a place in your heart immediately. I lost count how many times I had to smile or laugh. Where the game really shines is the level design. It starts with exploring the summercamp and later you become able to access the minds (the main levels if you want) of all the characters which completely represent their personality. Did you ever wonder what is happening in the head of a schizophrenic milkman or a giant mutated and mindcontrolled fish? The levels are really different ranging from straight platforming, to puzzles, fighting and more. On top there are tons of collectables which will help you to upgrade your character.TL;DR: If you like platformers or want a really unique gaming experience go ahead and buy this game.			"

												Positive+ Expertly crafted story and writing in general; with entertaining and unique characters, as well as intelligent dialogue/humour that very few games can match+ Some very bizarre imagery, with an interesting art style+ Wide variety of gameplay styles: with the various PSI abilities, and some of the best 3D platforming in the industry; the level design especially is both imaginative and memorable+ Clocking in at around 10 hours of playtime (many more if you wish to collect all of the various collectibles), the game is lengthy and doesn’t drag on for too long nor feel too short.Negative- Occasionally the camera can be a little awkward, especially when it comes to the platforming, making missed jumps a little irritating, as well as the targeting system being a little iffy at times- Somewhat inconsistent difficulty curve: though for the most part the game is relatively easy, some parts may take a few more tries to beat than expected.Verdict“Put simply, one of the most memorable and fun games I’ve ever played. Unfortunately, the game sold fairly poor on release, so a sequel to this game ever being created is unlikely, which makes the ending even more bittersweet. But don’t let that put you off from playing this witty masterpiece of a game. You will not regret it.”9/10			"

												Psychonauts is one of the best games I've ever played. It's a third person action/adventure game with a great story about brain theft at a psychic summer camp, and you're thrown into the middle of it as a psychic who ran away from the circus.Being set in a psychic summer camp, you already know you're in for some great special abilities like telekinesis and levitation, but by far the best feature of Psychonauts is that levels are created by entering someone's mind and dealing with all their emotional problems, fighting off the creatures that lurk within, and sorting out their emotional baggage (quite literally). Once you complete a stage, you leave that person in a much better emotional and mental state... well... that's the idea anyway.The musical score, sound effects, and particularly the voice acting is top tier, with the main character, Raz, voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz - who is probably best known as the voice of Invader Zim or maybe as Daggett from Angry Beavers.As good as Psychonauts is, it does have a few issues. The camera angle can be a bit annoying at times, but it's mostly alright. Also, I found myself unable to beat the game using a keyboard and mouse setup - one of the later levels has some platforming that felt impossible, but after I got myself an Xbox 360 controller I was able to get past that tricky section, so I'd say a decent controller is an absolute must.10 out of 10 I don't care if it had a few minor issues, the rest was so good I couldn't possibly give it a lower score.

												A really good game.It might seem weird, but the art style is quite original. Realistic enough for you to be familiar with, but strange enough to be a new experience.Gameplay is really solid. Few platforming games reach such a level of originality. and the powers are pretty useful.Level design is varied and sets different challenges.Storyline is interesting, not the most profound you could get, but it's a pretty solid one.I'd recommend this to pretty much everyone. you'll have for tens of hours with it.

												One of the most unique games ever created. In fact, it's more than a game, it's a piece of art. The worlds inside the minds of the characters are mind-blowing, the dialogs are hilarious, the plot is cleverly constructed, and bacon is a beacon. The only thing I didn't like in this game is that most of the characters were designed by 2D artists, and although they look great in the drawings, they look very bad in 3D (see e.g. Crystal and Clem). The last level is not as hard as its reputation suggests, especially since they made it much more forgiving in the Steam version than it is in the GOG version (that one is so old, it still has the Majesco logo).

												Haven't played much of it yet, I'm still at the campsite, but the gameplay is really fun. It's a 3D platformer with fun dialogue and fun combat, it has several collectibles in each level, including 'figments' which are 2D outlines of various things. There are lots of these to collect and it keeps exploration high. You start with pretty basic attacks - a punch combo and a ground pound - but every 10 levels you gain more. If you like 3D platformers, give it a shot. I could compare this to Ty the tasmanian tiger, which had partially similar visuals and controls, they also both had more powers or weapons available as you progressed. If you played and enjoyed Ty, You'll enjoy this.			"

												Let me just start off with saying, that i LOVE this game. I have played it through 4 times now and i recently picked it up on steam and 100% completed the game. The story is very interesting and somewhat original. A lot of people say, that the game hasn't aged well, but the cartoony and sometimes dodgy graphics somehow appeal to me more than modern games. I do agree, that the controls are a bit akward without a contoler, but you can get used to them. The most important aspect about this game to me is that it scratches an itch... The countles collectibles are not obligatory to collect, but the ranking sistem makes them very rewarding. The feeling that you get after collecting every figment in a level is great and you feel like you have achieved something. (figments are one of the collectible and often hard to notice 2D models that make levels look full and colorfull)Lastly i want to talk about the music. In my oppinion it is very well made and fits in the rather bizzare world of the game very well. I was very happy when i had the chance to get the official sountracks from the Humble Bundle.This game is a lovely little gem from the 2005 and it's well worth its price. I can't recommend this game enough.			"

												I just recently finished Psychonauts. Sadly, I did not do it well enough to have gotten all the achievements -- I'm debating a second playthrough to get those I'm missing.  Nevertheless, it's a truly fun game.  Yes, it's a platformer, so you will spend some time just trying to make certain jump sequences, or hunting for a missing thing when you thought you already checked the whole level, or replaying a boss fight because the camera angles are often terrible. But yes, despite that it's funny and fun and it made me laugh out loud quite a bit at the ridiculousness of it all.You play Raz, a young boy who has run away from the circus to join in at Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp and hopefully to become a Psychonaut -- an international mental agent.  The levels are insane -- your slightly abnormal summer camp (filled with other psychic children) soon becomes an exploration of the other minds around you, in all their whacky weirdness.Now ... back to debating whether to finish all the achievements...

												Masterpiece.You need more? This is an adventure/platformer, from the 2000, so it aged a bit. Adventure features, zeldaish kind of thing. And platformer but the 2000 3D, which means N64 period, the first age of it. You can finish it easily if you are a gamer, you may struggle a bit if you are a casual. It is long, weird and gamerish, so if you are into that, got an X360 controller, you will love it. If not...You need even more? This is Tim Schafer last marvel (after that, I gave up on him, unfortunately). So if you loved previous T.S. works of art like Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, or Grim Fandango, and found they too were masterpieces, do not think further and buy Psychonauts.You need always more?! This is a BRILLIANT work of art. You can enjoy it as a platformer passionate, because it is really rich regarding that. You can enjoy it adventure wise, because there is TONS to collect, reminiscent of N64 times like Banjo&Kazooie style. You can enjoy it storywise because it is huge, meticulously written, an old souvenir from the 90s point and clicks where you had to WRITE a STORY before developing a game.Great music, great dialogues, very original world, very smart and psychological and analytical scenario... and it is a real Tim Schafer universe, the real one, not today's. DO RECOMMEND that masterpiece.			"

												Whenever I think about this game I get a tear in my eye because this is one of the most inspired games I've ever seen.. 9.5/10Every level is unique and revolves around a few specific psychic abilities that you're given. What's neat about the abilities is that for most of them, you don't use only one for a level and then stop using it for the rest of the game. Each ability has its place in plenty of areas, from when you get it to the game's end. (The same kind of applies to the items you're given/you buy, many levels have extra goodies for you to go back and obtain with them!)The gameplay is super super fun but the camera can get a bit wonky at times, especially during levels that require elevation(like the area above the theatre level, which made me lose my sh*t :^) )The characters are all excellently characterized and the game does a very good job of thawing out their backstories. Another thing about the characters is they're all incredibly memorable; each and every one of them have fitting (and very talented, may I add) voice actors and unique designs that it's almost hard to forget any of them. (*Note: I am the Milkman.)I remember almost every scene from this game, and I mean maybe that's because it's only been 2-3 months since I've played it buuut I do believe I'll still remember them a year or two from now. Especially Goggalor... GOGGALOR!!!!!To be entirely honest, this is probably one of the best games I have ever played. If I had to give it a personal ranking, it's probably either my second or third favorite video game of all time beside Kingdom Hearts 2.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ guys please, if you're reading this and you're genuinly interested in getting this game, by all means do it. It's definitely worth the price and you will put a good amount of hours into it, especially if you go for a bit of achievement hunting like I did. It'll also make you more excited for the upcoming sequel!!!(which I'm super super hyped for!) "

												I quite enjoy this game, as I was not able to play when it came out (just didn't have the money as I was too young to really make any amount of money at the time) but it's nice to have it ported over to Steam. A couple of problems, the mapping for keyboard only is........ Well it leaves something to be desired, it's not game breaking and if you really tried I'm sure it would all make sense, but the worst part of that is if you want to use a controller. Yes yes, I know, no true PC gamer would stray from the mouse and keyboard, but this game was never designed for mouse and keyboard, so I thought obviously using one would be preferred, but it's really not. It auto maps, but some things still require the keyboard and mouse along with it. I found a couple of glitches early on, stuttering frames where some audio cut in and out (nothing terrible, just noticable) and areas where the frames just drop for no apparent reason. But, all in all for a port, this is well worth the money, and coming from someone who can't have his nastalgia goggles on, I'd recommend it for sure.			"

												I have to preface this a bit;  I love this game as much as anyone, but it's tedious if you want it to be.  When I first played this, I basically marathoned it over two long sittings.  I did everything I could, completely 100%'d the game.Now, returning to it after having bought it again on sale (Originally played on Xbox), I have to admit the game isn't suited to doing in such a complete fashion again.  Everything holds up, for the most part.  I absolutely adore running around the campgrounds, seeking out various items.  It's pretty basic, but the atmosphere invoked being so similar to that of a Saturday morning cartoon just pulls at my heartstrings something fierce.  When you get into the meat of the game, however, it falls apart a bit.  The platforming is mostly simple, and that's no issue.  It does what it should and it does it well enough.  The game is truly unique in its presentation, that's what makes it worth playing.  The real issue is with the figment collecting.  It's tedious as can be.It's like playing Banjo Kazooie or another collectathon, but everything you want to get, runs away from you.Through walls.It's very frustrating to run through a level more than once to find a chicken that just happens to hide in walls until the very second you turn around.All in all though, wonderful game.  A must play for anyone that loves games in my opinion, just don't get too caught up in seeing every little detail of this game.  The little things just hinder an otherwise amazing game, filled with detail and character not frequently seen.			"

												If you happen to be a Millennial gamer, Psychonauts needs to be on your gaming short-list.  Equal parts Nintendo platformer, LucasArts adventure, and 1990s era Nickelodeon cartoon, it was tailor-made to put a smile on your face.Whispering Rock Summer Camp is the home of our hero for the duration of the story, and much as Hogwarts instructs young wizards, this retreat is a school for psychics.  Using his mental abilities, Razputin will invade the thoughts of friend and foe alike, and these mindscapes will function as a range of diverse levels.  Ever have somebody tell you that some scary creature was more afraid of you than you were of it?  Raz has one of these moments with a giant mutated lungfish, and upon entering its head, he finds himself filling the role of Godzilla in a city of tiny lungfish.

The game only becomes frustrating in the rare event of the camera getting stuck at an unfortunate angle.UPDATE:First level is fairly weak, but the game really picks up off after the initial boss fight. Some very imaginative levels, and quirky characters that keep the game fun throughout. Platforming mechanics are solid, powers feel useful in many situations, and the camera manages to behave itself almost all the time.			"

												As a fan of 3D platformers with a spare dollar to spend during a Steam sale, I decided to give Double Fine Productions' cult classic Psychonauts a try. After hearing about the alleged creativity and uniqueness the game offered, I wondered if the reviews were to be believed.  Psychonauts follows the adventure of an eager young psychic named Razputin as he uncovers the secrets behind Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp, along with the minds of various characters around the area. When things take a turn for the worst, it becomes up to him to put an end to it and save his fellow campers. Though the distinct graphical style may initially scare some players off, its fits the tone of the game to a 'T'. Psychonauts seems to take much of its inspiration from Western animation in terms of its character tropes and setting, and it definitely works. Combined with the superb voice acting, interesting plot and remarkable concept, the atmosphere is definitely an enjoyable one. Along with the characters and overall mood the game gives off, the level design and gameplay is superb. The hub area is a nice concept, allowing the player to see what their favorite campers are up to while they take a break from the story. Along with housing numerous secret items, it also allows them to quickly transmit to and fro each section at will. Being a game called ""Psychonauts"", it certainly shines during the levels taking place in the minds Razputin enters. Each of these possesses a unique feeling and theme to reflect the personality of the character in question. Each level also hosts their own set of challenges, and will make the player eager to progress and see what awaits them. Unfortunately, there is not much left to be explored of each world once it is cleared for the first time – the player only needs to return unless they are aiming to gather all the collectable items.On an entirely different note, the player is given an item early in the game that allows them to ask for advice if they are stuck. The advice offered is simple, yet effective and allows the player to work around most obstacles without the game flat-out doing it for them. The game does not push or force the player to use this feature, allowing this to appeal to both those who are easily frustrated and those who want to work things out for themselves.Of course no game is perfect, and Psychonauts is no exception to this rule. While I do not intend to sound like a certain critic featured within the game, Psychonauts possesses a few flaws which prevent it from becoming my absolute favorite. The keyboard controls feel very confusing and complicated, making a controller almost necessary to play this game; although once this is done it handles rather nicely. A certain level in the game titled ""The Milkman Conspiracy"" prevents you from progressing unless you purchase an expensive item which removes the object blocking the path, which have previously only appeared in locations that would indicate this would be an optional side quest. Though the game warns the player of this obstacle beforehand, this still forces them to tediously grind for currency. The very same level also possesses a more puzzle-based structure which requires a copious amount of backtracking as well as repeatedly searching the area for objects which can easily be missed. A miniboss is also fought here twice with no warning, variation, or possibility of skipping. While this is an understandable attempt to give the level some of the action offered by previous worlds, it becomes tedious and annoying when introduced in this fashion. Thankfully, this area is one of the game's most humor-rich areas which makes up for a good deal of its flaws, but it still is far from ideal. Though the game has its imperfections here and there, Psychonauts is certainly an enjoyable and memorable experience for fans of the platformer genre. On a final note - if you do purchase the game, be wary that much of the game's content is spoiled through achievements and trading cards.			"

												If you have not already bought this game. Find the sharpest metal object next to you, and jam it into your hand. This is your punishement for not buying this game. Whilst steam says I only have played a few hours on this, I have played it offline much longer. This is contested for my favourite game of all time, with Bioshock. The Storyline is good, the gameplay core mechanics are wonderful and if you can excuse some dodgy platforming at times it makes a good experience. It seems to have a difficulty curve like Micheal Jacksons music career and makes the last 3 levels extremly difficult. There is many secrets to be found and frankly if I can set squirrels on fire then I will play the game to my hearts content.			"

												Get this game! Psychonauts is one of those gems you most likely have missed out on. It pulls you through your ""victims"" brain and you see the world as they see it. This makes the world look brilliantly different when considering that some of the brain-owners are slightly or completely insane. I would play it just for the strange setting and the sheer weirdness of the worlds. At the bottom of it all, it is a semi action-adventure-platformer which utilizes ""spells""(or rather ""brain spells"" such as telekinesis) to get to the objective. If you are even remotely interested in either platformers or adventure games you should already have played this game. Only bad things I can come to think of is that the camera is a bit wonky at times(which sadly was the case for all 3d platformers back when this was released), the difficulty sort of explodes at a certain point in the game(in other words; it's not a natural evolving difficulty curve), and (SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING!!!

												Seriously people, it's a cult classic for a reason. If you're planning on buying this wait until it's on crazy sale (Bought my copy when it was going for practically 1.75$ CAN ) because around the halfway point when there's not much left to learn the game gets MAD difficult, and if you buy it for the 9.99$ current full price, you might feel like you have wasted your money. Besides that, who honestly doesn't want to fool (Without spoiling anything) agents into thinking you're one of them? Or become Godzilla? Of hell, simply light things on fire? This game really has it all in lue of imagenation (Here's looking at you Godzilla level that took me forever). Plus you get to play as a kid from the circus that decided to run away from it (Rather than TO it as many children must have planned to do at some point in childhood before they were allowed to cross the streets by themselves... I know I did... Sat on the curb for three hours huffing that my plans had been foiled by the road, what can I say, I was -and still am- adventerous) All in all, it's a darn good game. You'd be hard pressed to find another Tim Schafer gem like this one... Critisizm would be that darn difficulty curve... Oh and like, four of the kids in the game are aggrivatingly annoying as ♥♥♥♥, but at least there's only one 'Escort' thing that's totally optional, but nets you some sweet, sweet arrowheads (Money in this game) if you do it (And it's simple as hell if you're quick to reassure the character that they can make it). Other than that, it's a really good game.			"

												As much as I am not a fan of Mr. Schafer right now, this game is an underrated masterpiece. A sheer joy to play and explore, and it will bring you right back to your youthful days at summer camp ... with a sci-fi twist. Turns out being a psychic warrior and diving into minds is a lot of fun!I always wished you could explore more minds, though, but probably couldn't due to space and hardware limitations.			"

												Go here to support PSYCHONAUTS 2:https://www.fig.co/campaigns/psychonauts-2YES, it is as real as the air you breath.The actual review:Ever get to a game so late that it came out 2 generations ago?Well that was me this year when I finally played Psychonauts. Ironically, I had already owned this game TWICE and never gotten around to playing it. I'm a firm believer that disappointment is always the prelude to something much better. My 21 hours with Psyhonauts was proof enough for me because I know had I played it on when I owned it for the original Xbox(or the atrocious looking port that slipped it's way on the PSN store) I would have not have likely enjoyed it as much as the PC version.You play a young boy named Razputin(Raz for short) who sneaks his way into a summer camp specifically for kids with psychic abilities. You start off with some basic ""braining"" missions to get your feet wet only to find out there's a secret plot to take over the world being hatched under everyone's noses.The visual presentation is something I immediately noticed when I booted up this game. My laptop has some fairly decent specs. Since this was already an older game I naturally turned all the settings to max(the game allows for full HD display at 1920 x1080 pixels, btw) and was literally blown away. Characters and environments(though somewhat dated looking)were sharp and clean, on-screen colors were vibrant and lively and textures(especially on Raz and some level segments) were highly detailed. Couple that with the game consistently running at a solid 60 fps and you have quite the throwback here if you never experienced it before like I did.The overall gameplay doesn't do much to reinvent the wheel but the controls are solid and most of Raz's abilities are fairly unique in comparison to most other platformers. In short you're getting a game that shines more through it's delivery of quirky worlds, clever level design and and a bizarre yet highly memorable story.The characters are fun and some even hilarious, the music is practically an orchestral masterpiece and every single level has a unique flavor that will stick in your head even after you've finished. My favorite without a doubt was Black Velvetopia with it's high contrasting neon colors, clever symbolism and absolutely badass theme music that all came together making me think ""Mexican TRON Laser Tag"".This game is by no means a staple in gameplay standards or mechanics, but it doesn't have to be to succeed as well as it does. It's colorful, charismatic and so well thought out. Everything from story to gemeplay and sound design is executed on a level that many games of today aren't even achieving.The last 10 years of game releases has been missing the kind of flavor that Psychonauts brings to the table. Creativity has been mostly been traded for ""sellability"" and unique and original concepts like these are almost non-existent in most AAA titles.If I had one(and ONLY one) real complaint with this game it's that the rendered cutscenes look like absolute ♥♥♥♥ compared to the game itself. Had they rerendered them in higher quality or just did something to imprive their appearance this game might be damn near perfect as it stands.This is seriously one crazy cool game. BUY THIS GAME.Support funding for Psychonauts 2 so we can get a sequel!https://www.fig.co/campaigns/psychonauts-2 "

												Psychonauts has likeable characters, clever worldbuilding, and is overall full of personailty.That said, it REALLY shows that Tim was more used to adventure games than 3-D collect-a-thon platformers.When there are adventure-game-type puzzles (like Gloria's Theater or the Milkman Conspiracy), the game really shines. Unfortunately, that's not the majority of the game. The majority of the game involves gimmicky powers (I never used the shield outside the level you get it in, and Clairvoyance mostly just has comedic effect), very basic platforming (and even MORE basic combat), and some of the most tedious collect-a-thon-ing I've seen in any game.You may have noticed that, despite all this, I am still recommending the game. Why? Because it was a fun ride despite these glaring flaws. The atmosphere alone compensates for many of these issues tenfold. The various worlds you explore are neat, and the art style is solid.I'm glad I played it, I'm just unlikely to play it again.			"

												I was always on the outside looking in when it came to Psychonauts. Never really played it when I was younger, but heard it was a great game from others. I decided to give it a try on a whim and was incredibly pleased with my decision.It is a phenomenal game.There are so many fun-loving, humorous portions of the game. While, at a closer look, you can pluck out some dark underlying sub-plots. These can range from intense paranoia, insanity, heartbreak, and obviously enough, death. You are playing around in a game and you are playing around in people's minds. There is so much twisted fun to be had.The one thing I would not recommend you do is play on mouse & keyboard. I tried to go as long as I could without a controller, but finally buckled and got one when it came to more ""combat-heavy"" sections of the game.TL;DR - You will not regret playing this. (Unless it leaves you wanting more and you have to wait for Psychonauts 2...)			"

IT'S ONLY $10 AND USALY ON SALE!! JUST BUY THE GAME!! HOLY CRAP THIS GAME IS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!But in all seriousness, this game has a memorable cast of characters, a very funny and quirky plot and probibly one of the most intresting ideas for a game I could ever think of. Now the only downside I can think of is around the time you reach the asylum, everything kind of screaches to a halt so you can help some patients out. Also the game suffers from ""Point of no return"" syndrome. As soon as you free a certain someone from a mad doctor, you CAN NOT go back to the overworld. So you can not go back and finish side quests AT ALL.			"

												I had this game when I was very young, when it first came out on the original XBox. I played it for hours on end, day in and day out. Nothing was alble to stop me. Then, one day, I happened to look at the bottom of the disk and noticed that I couldn't see the silvery part very well because it had been scratched so badly. I played it for another day or so and suddenly it wouldn't work anymore. Seeing as they didn't make the game anymore and we couldn't resurface the disk, I was out of luck. Until the day I saw it on Steam. I bought it faster than instantly and, as of today, my 10-year goal to finish the game has been completed.8/10       Unfortunately, even though it's my favoritest game of all time, there are some bugs and things that aren't smoothed out, such as moving while turning the camera sometimes messes up and some swingy bars are hard to grab onto, but all in all there are some great puzzles and a wonderful story with humor mixed in somewhere along the way. Definitely worth checking out.			"

												I highly recommend psychonauts to anyone who is nostalgic for the 3rd person platformers of the 2000s.PROS:Every level is unique and well designed, and each introduces different gameplay mechanics, so the game never gets boring. The game is genuinely funny.It makes you care about the characters by making you help them through their problems, and showing you how they got those problems.Unique powers that are used in many different situations.It has puns.CONS:The upgrades didn't feel neccesary to complete the game.Since I didn't feel like the upgrades were neccesary I didn't try to get any of the collectibles, except for ones that added more to the story or raised my health bar.One level had alot of unskippable cutscenes that I had to watch multiple times.The final level seemed to hard, but the final boss felt really easy.But the pros do really outway the cons in this game, and I hope you check it out.P.S If ten dollars seems like too much to you, just wait for it to be ninety nine cents in every steam sale.

												I just finished this game a day ago and it's now easily one of my top ten favorite games.It has some warts, no doubt. The PC and Mac ports are a little finicky (at the time of this writing it's crashed a total of 8 times on me, and I had to unbind the camera controls on my controller because it kept pointing the camera directly up), the camera can be obnoxious and the final level is stupidly frustrating, but because of how amazing the rest of the game is you can easily forgive that.There's so much depth in the story and characters (told through a giant collect-a-thon, but that's mid '00's games for you) that it's easy to get lost in the strange world that Psychonauts takes place in. You'll drive yourself (aptly) insane trying to find all the figments just for that extra little morsel of story, and then you'll go back through the game AGAIN and pick up on little story hints that you missed the first time.The writing is excellent, thanks to Eric Wolpaw and Tim Schafer (say what you will about him, he at least knows how to write good dialogue), the gameplay holds up, and the characters are interesting and fun to interact with.

												I got this game for $1 during the winter sale, and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it. It has a sense of humor and can be light at time, while still giving you a sense of purpose as the story develops. Going through each characters mind felt unique and interesting each time, giving a sense of who the people were. One issue I had was the mechanics, playing with a mouse and keyboard in a platformer like this, especially with the camera angles, can prove frusturating at times, however, it's what can be expected from a game that's over 10 years old, and is by no means 'game breaking' as some might say. Overall, a fun and creative game well worth the money.			"

												TL;DR: Buy it.Just like most of the people who have written reviews about this game, I bought and played it during the winter sale of 2016. I had heard positive remarks about this game in the past, and it was only $0.99, so I decided to play it. Psychonauts is very different from the norm of video games. It has a nice art style. All of the characters, ranging from the most unimportant campers, to the camp counselors, all have a personality. The game plays nicely, although the platforming is a bit unfair at times. The fighting's okay. It's not really anything groundbreaking. The thing that really sets this game apart is the concept of a summer camp for psychics. You can learn different abilities via badges, the way you access different worlds is by putting a tiny little door on someone's head, and beat up men wearing suits with giant stamps. It's also funny. I found this game to be actually funny. It has clever writing, a nice art style, a fresh, new concept, and overall, it's just a great game. I will have to say that one of its biggest issues is the difficulty curve. At the end of the game, there was this one segment that I could not get past. It took me half an hour to get past that one stage. The game's not very difficult at first, aside from the psychic bears roaming the camp, but at the end, ♥♥♥♥ went balls to the walls. It also doesn't have a good replayability. Once you finish the game, there's not a lot you can do. You could try looking for all of the scavenger items, but that's about it. I definately recommend this game to anyone who wants a fresh, new concept and funny writing.			"

However, If you’re interested in children, magic, and camps surrounded by tall fences ruled by a dictator, then you are a completely normal person and you will enjoy this game with a passionate passion.

These chalk drawings will consume your life, soul, and bodily fluids as at first they are easy to spot giving you a false sense of accomplishment. This easy peasy mindset lasts until the last one where you have to jump across the universe upside down on one leg blindfolded with a firecracker up your butt to get it. Since it’s the last one you have to get it, you're a gamer, OCD and completion run in your veins. Every fiber in your body is saying ""go on get the last chalk drawing"" but you must resist.

Then one day a bunch of stuck up scientist with their high and mighty positions decided enough was enough. Pluto had it too good for too long.

												Psychonauts is a game that stands on its setting. First off, the environment is wonderfully designed. The setting is a summer camp for psychics, and the everyday beauty of nature is distorted by the childlike playfulness ofthe supernatural elements. Boardwalks don't just wind down forest paths, but undulate through space, twisting and turning like something out of a Tim Burton film. The characters are engaging and bizarre, their quirks lovingly detailed, both in appearance and characterization, making everyone unique. There are no generic ""background characters"" in this game; every character has a backstory, a personality, and their own plot that winds through the narrative of the game. Once you get into the mechanics, however, there are some problems. There are some control issues, and most of the challenge comes, not from the game, but trying to marshal the controls into doing what you want, rather than actually using them to accomplish goals. The only other blemish on the face of this otherwise wonderful game is that the leveling is a bit grind-y, and centered around a series of scavenger hunts, rather than actual gameplay. That said, I feel that a traditional ""Combat->XP"" system would not have worked with this game, as combat seems to be something that happens when it has to, rather than a constant method of progressing through the game.In short, the play is a little slow and glitchy, but with the engaging setting, you won't mind it much.

												This game is great. What it lacks in graphics it gains in very diverse characters and enviroments. Literally every character is memorable and original. It has a good story which makes way for fun gameplay, and you have a plethora of useful tools and abilities, which make you think in different ways in every situation. The game rewards exploration, 'levelling' the player as they explore and find new things. Every 'level', or segment of the game, is very original and memorable, each with a distinct art style, characters, mechanics and story. For example, - potential spoilers - the Milkman level requires you to enter the mind of a deranged paranoid arsonist. The world in his mind reflects his character, with security cameras and conspiracies plenty. The world is a warped version of an urban street section, and is very entertaining to explore. There are also funny and memorable quotes from the 'workers' of the streets, making for a very fun experience.			"

Dialogues are an absolute riot, the puzzles are interesting and the combat is varied enough to be fun. Level design is perhaps the game's greatest strength, you will visit mind-worlds as diverse as the people (and creatures) they belong to, with every world having different mechanics, which saves the game from becoming grindy.

												This was...a truly wondeful game. Initially, I first came across Physconauts as a picture, one of those random pictures that sometimes appear on google images for some reason or another, intrigued by the oddball style of character design, I looked further into the game, and I was struck by it's capacity to keep you interested. The music for all stages reflected well not only upon the mind of who you were exploring, with each person's mind receiving a unique piece. The character designs are not based on traditional aesthetic values, but still create a diverse cast who, while a great many of them are barely mentioned in the actual plot, are prominent in the many little side affairs that make up camp life (which I found created a realisticness in a place where not too many would expect it). One of the main things I really liked about the game was the exploration factor, in that, the Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp proved a vast place to poke, jump, burn, and run around, in fact, a moderate chunk of late game fighting capacity relies on your exploration. Interestingly enough, Psychonauts doesn't rely on overt violence to keep you entertained, although there usually is mental censors of some kind to fight through as minor obstacles in most minds. Instead, you must explore through various places, figuring out how to best get around (One case being how to go up a street without being run over by a bull.) That isn't to say the boss fights aren't challenging. Far from it, as the boss fights I've encountered here, rely not on overt violence, but rather figuring out how to use various psychic powers to exploit the enemy's weakness and win from there. Combine this with amusing dialogue, jokes for all ages, and minor plot arcs which lead one to speculation about real life people based on fictional characters, and many other things which make the Game of Psychonauts a Must Play.

												Psychonauts is my favorite platformer of all time, 3d or 2d.  Its the kind of platformer you can tell was developed by adventure game people.  And that combination hit a sweet spot.  The art, voices, pacing, variety, humor and mental health subtext is all pretty amazing as well. Definitely a classic.			"

												This is a cool game. The character design is amazing, and hasn't been restricted to ""realistic-looking"". The craziness in the characters, the appearance of the game and the story really draws you in. The level design has a good balance of puzzle solving and enemy battling.

												So good.  I just finished playing this for the second time, and I'm actually kinda sad now that I don't have more Psychonauts to play when I come home from work.The most stand-out thing about this game is just that it makes me smile. Like a real, physical grin, not just an internal chuckle.Unfortunately the conventional wisdom about the platforming is still kinda true too. It's not universally terrible, but it fights you just a little too much in key spots. But in the end, it's all good. Deus Ex has goofy voice acting, Thief has bad animations, Psychonauts has glitchy platforming. (Although probably above-average for 3D platformers.) It's still an all-time classic.Looks pretty great on the PC too, and the PC version works well with my 360 pad. One note: if you're playing with a 360 pad and notice any issues with the button icons, you could try applying this fix: http://www.doublefine.com/forums/viewthread/4952/ "

												Psychonauts is a one-in-a-million unique gem, and the only people who wouldn't enjoy it are the ones who ironically need Raz's help the MOST. Yes, it's a platformer. Yes, there are different worlds, each with their own themes. And that's where the similarities end. At a Summer camp for psychics, something is amiss in the brains of... just about everybody. And it's up to you to set things right, by entering into the visual manifestation of their minds. On the outside, Psychonauts is rife with Tim Schafer's signature humor and wit. As you peel back the layers, however, there's a delicious darkness to it all. What happened to these people? Are you prepared to see what paranoia, O.C.D., and bi-polar disorder do to a person's perception of the world? Are you prepared to battle their inner demons and dig out their dark secrets, all the while bouncing around on a mental bubble and setting things on fire just to see what happens? Then step through the door, young Psy Cadet. It's time to learn.			"

The main meat of the game is its story and setting.Tim Schafer's writing at its best. It is hilarious but also... good. With well written and developed characters and strong themes. Levels are varied and fun. The only problem I found in the game is its finale. The gameplay, while fine, is not very tight. It works just fine while the game is forgiving but the ending requires some precise platforming and I found it to be quite frustrating (and this version's final level is easier than the original release, I hear!).

												This was...a truly wondeful game. Initially, I first came across Physconauts as a picture, one of those random pictures that sometimes appear on google images for some reason or another, intrigued by the oddball style of character design, I looked further into the game, and I was struck by it's capacity to keep you interested. The music for all stages reflected well not only upon the mind of who you were exploring, with each person's mind receiving a unique piece. The character designs are not based on traditional aesthetic values, but still create a diverse cast who, while a great many of them are barely mentioned in the actual plot, are prominent in the many little side affairs that make up camp life (which I found created a realisticness in a place where not too many would expect it). One of the main things I really liked about the game was the exploration factor, in that, the Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp proved a vast place to poke, jump, burn, and run around, in fact, a moderate chunk of late game fighting capacity relies on your exploration. Interestingly enough, Psychonauts doesn't rely on overt violence to keep you entertained, although there usually is mental censors of some kind to fight through as minor obstacles in most minds. Instead, you must explore through various places, figuring out how to best get around (One case being how to go up a street without being run over by a bull.) That isn't to say the boss fights aren't challenging. Far from it, as the boss fights I've encountered here, rely not on overt violence, but rather figuring out how to use various psychic powers to exploit the enemy's weakness and win from there. Combine this with amusing dialogue, jokes for all ages, and minor plot arcs which lead one to speculation about real life people based on fictional characters, and many other things which make the Game of Psychonauts a Must Play.

												I highly recommend psychonauts to anyone who is nostalgic for the 3rd person platformers of the 2000s.PROS:Every level is unique and well designed, and each introduces different gameplay mechanics, so the game never gets boring. The game is genuinely funny.It makes you care about the characters by making you help them through their problems, and showing you how they got those problems.Unique powers that are used in many different situations.It has puns.CONS:The upgrades didn't feel neccesary to complete the game.Since I didn't feel like the upgrades were neccesary I didn't try to get any of the collectibles, except for ones that added more to the story or raised my health bar.One level had alot of unskippable cutscenes that I had to watch multiple times.The final level seemed to hard, but the final boss felt really easy.But the pros do really outway the cons in this game, and I hope you check it out.P.S If ten dollars seems like too much to you, just wait for it to be ninety nine cents in every steam sale.

												I just finished this game a day ago and it's now easily one of my top ten favorite games.It has some warts, no doubt. The PC and Mac ports are a little finicky (at the time of this writing it's crashed a total of 8 times on me, and I had to unbind the camera controls on my controller because it kept pointing the camera directly up), the camera can be obnoxious and the final level is stupidly frustrating, but because of how amazing the rest of the game is you can easily forgive that.There's so much depth in the story and characters (told through a giant collect-a-thon, but that's mid '00's games for you) that it's easy to get lost in the strange world that Psychonauts takes place in. You'll drive yourself (aptly) insane trying to find all the figments just for that extra little morsel of story, and then you'll go back through the game AGAIN and pick up on little story hints that you missed the first time.The writing is excellent, thanks to Eric Wolpaw and Tim Schafer (say what you will about him, he at least knows how to write good dialogue), the gameplay holds up, and the characters are interesting and fun to interact with. If you missed out on playing this, this is a must-have.			"

												Incredibly funny, clever and creative. One if its kind and a must play.Gameplay is decent. It is a action/adventure platformer providing a good mix of combat, platforming and exploration. The main meat of the game is its story and setting.Tim Schafer's writing at its best. It is hilarious but also... good. With well written and developed characters and strong themes. Levels are varied and fun. The only problem I found in the game is its finale. The gameplay, while fine, is not very tight. It works just fine while the game is forgiving but the ending requires some precise platforming and I found it to be quite frustrating (and this version's final level is easier than the original release, I hear!).

												This was...a truly wondeful game. Initially, I first came across Physconauts as a picture, one of those random pictures that sometimes appear on google images for some reason or another, intrigued by the oddball style of character design, I looked further into the game, and I was struck by it's capacity to keep you interested. The music for all stages reflected well not only upon the mind of who you were exploring, with each person's mind receiving a unique piece. The character designs are not based on traditional aesthetic values, but still create a diverse cast who, while a great many of them are barely mentioned in the actual plot, are prominent in the many little side affairs that make up camp life (which I found created a realisticness in a place where not too many would expect it). One of the main things I really liked about the game was the exploration factor, in that, the Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp proved a vast place to poke, jump, burn, and run around, in fact, a moderate chunk of late game fighting capacity relies on your exploration. Interestingly enough, Psychonauts doesn't rely on overt violence to keep you entertained, although there usually is mental censors of some kind to fight through as minor obstacles in most minds. Instead, you must explore through various places, figuring out how to best get around (One case being how to go up a street without being run over by a bull.) That isn't to say the boss fights aren't challenging. Far from it, as the boss fights I've encountered here, rely not on overt violence, but rather figuring out how to use various psychic powers to exploit the enemy's weakness and win from there. Combine this with amusing dialogue, jokes for all ages, and minor plot arcs which lead one to speculation about real life people based on fictional characters, and many other things which make the Game of Psychonauts a Must Play.

												Psychonauts seems like a rather polarizing game in that some people seem to think it's pure gold and some people think it's awful. Which group you'll fall into depends on weather you're the kind person who can allow things like excellent story-telling and charming arti direction excuse a few minor gameplay issues, or if you're the kind of twitching, Ritalin popping, XBox owner who falls into a coma when they go without killing something for five seconds. I'm just going to list out of context some of the things that occur in Psychonauts: a telekinetic bear, a dentist who harvests brains instead of teeth, and a sequence wherein you become a giant  monster and terrorize a society of fish. A game that features all of these things simply cannot be criticized. It's against the law or something. Now so your next course of action should probably be to buy it if you haven't already.			"

												This game is great. What it lacks in graphics it gains in very diverse characters and enviroments. Literally every character is memorable and original. It has a good story which makes way for fun gameplay, and you have a plethora of useful tools and abilities, which make you think in different ways in every situation. The game rewards exploration, 'levelling' the player as they explore and find new things. Every 'level', or segment of the game, is very original and memorable, each with a distinct art style, characters, mechanics and story. For example, - potential spoilers - the Milkman level requires you to enter the mind of a deranged paranoid arsonist. The world in his mind reflects his character, with security cameras and conspiracies plenty. The world is a warped version of an urban street section, and is very entertaining to explore. There are also funny and memorable quotes from the 'workers' of the streets, making for a very fun experience.			"

												I realize that this review is coming a little late and it's highly likely that no one will ever read this, but I only recently started writing my own game reviews and I would be highly remiss if I didn't put in a plug for my all-time favotite game.The graphics are showing their age, but other than that I can't think of any aspect of Psychonauts that I wouldn't descrive as excellent even today, almost ten years after the game's original release.  The gameplay, pacing, music, voice acting and story are all top-notch; but above and beyond all that, it has one feature that's utterly unequaled in any other game I've ever played: style!  What's more, due to the game's variety it reaches this incredibly high standard several times over.As a psychonaut, your job is to psychically enter the minds of others to achieve your goals.  Thus, each level is custom-tailored to the mind of the individual you're exploring.  In your instructor Mina's mind, you race through a dance party on a thought-bubble; in the mind of a giant mutated fish, you're a Godzilla-like monster laying waste to a city; and in the mind of a paranoid conspiracy nut, you make your way through a twisted suburban landscape where every bush conceals a hidden camera.  The masterpiece, though, has to be the ""Black Velvetopia"" level, which is a black velvet painting come to life.  Words don't do it justice -- It has to be experienced to be truly appreciated.The art, music, tone and even your goals are completely different in each mind you enter.  Any one of these levels could be considered a superior game all on its own; but together they constitute one of the greatest games ever made.The only bad news is that it looks like the game's developer was a one-hit wonder -- Double Fine hasn't since produced a single noteworthy title.

The game has a good offbeat sense of humor, decent platforming sensibilities, a variety of skills and challenges to use them on, etc.  I'll also rate it up for having some amazingly memorable level designs.  If you've played it, you know immediately the ones I mean; if not, you should.  But the scavenger hunt aspects..  ye gods.  I like exploring and will go a bit out of my way if I see a secret and think I can get to it.  But if you were a completionist and wanted to 100% the game, the quantity of stuff would probably drive you mad.  And if you wanted nothing to do with collecting stuff, the requirement to do so in order to level up would leave you frustrated.All in all, though, quite solid and potentially a lot of fun, despite some frustrating parts.

Psychonauts is a masterpiece game that is what I refer to affectionatley as the ogre. MY GOD IT HAS LAYERS. Just when you think that you've done everything that you can do in this game there's the scavenger hunt, listening to stories, and finding all of the secrets really adds to the complexity under the surface and it's the true nature of this game. Part way through the game, it takes on a new personality and previous areas of the game can be unlocked certain ways. It's that reason why this game is so great.

Psychonauts is the quirkiest of quirky games.  From the art styles to the different worlds you explore to the dialoge of the main characters & NPCs.  The story is especially quirky.  You jump into other Psychonauts' minds to learn new psychic abilities.  For some reason your own mind is being intruded by meat.  Yes, meat.  and you have to figure out why.  My favorite characters are the not-so-secret-agents in one world.  They all have the same male, monotone voice, but everything they say is amusing.  When you get the Clairvoyance psychic power you can use it on people, animals, and random objects to see yourself through their eyes.  For example: Rats would see you as cheese, and the mailboxes see you as a person covered in question marks..  Yeah, it's weird.   This game is a Must Play and has great Replayability			"

Intro & SummaryPsychonauts is a fun journey and romp as a kid at a psychic summer camp, learning psychic powers and using them to explore a fun story, and equally fantastically designed world.Clocking in at 13 hours, but has such a surprisingly rich and detailed main story that you'll likely clock in at least double that.HighlightsThe core of a good single player is it's storyline or arc. This game, hands down, has the best I've ever played. You care enough about the characters to drive you forward, humour is packed everywhere, and is mature and funny, little details, easter eggs and extras are scattered anywhere you can think of. I routinely come back and run through this game every couple years, and find new things I completely missed the last time.MistakesHonestly, practically none. You could argue that one of the few thousand set pieces are flawed slightly to make a challenging section frustrating, or go wrong once or twice, but even that is a stretch on what is pretty much a perfectly designed and polished game, which somehow still feels quirky and personal.BuyingPsychonauts is routinely available for $5 or less, and has even hit as low as $1 on Steam and Indie Bundles. It will not leave you feeling like a jerk after paying full price, and given the quality and fun it's worth at least that.			"

												This game is probably the most frustrating yet still lovable game I've played in the last few years. I'm sure if I had played the game when it came out the clunky platforming wouldn't have been as frustrating (okay yea it would be but at least I would be used to it) but it still didn't hinder the gameplay all that much (except when it bugged out during a boss). It reminded me of the platformers from when I was a kid and had charming humor you just don't see anymore. Raz is a spunky little kid who is joined by a colorful (and colorful MOUTHED) class of superpowered children who need a better adult than they got at camp.The story is wonderfully told through the ""minds"" of some eccentric people and through the eyes of a naive and hopeful child. It's sure to throw you for a loop and back again. The art style is off putting at first because of the weird and just purposely ugly designs but they grow on you. The levels are just beautiful (especially Black Velvetopia) and I've never seen anything like them before. They make your head spin and frustrate you, but it's all a part of the fun.The only bad parts of this game I think are the clunky outdated controls making it hard to platform, missable achievements, the final level Meat Circus... even the achievement says ""i thought that was unbeatable"" and for a slow computer it is!, and let's not forget the monotonous collecting of all figments.But it does have replay value if you miss some things, you just won't want to 100% it again. It's unforgettable dialogue and one of a kind cast really leave a lasting impression on you. I'm glad I got to play it first as an adult because I wouldn't have gotten half the jokes 10 years ago. I think it would do well to have a remake (or at least remaster with better controls) because I already miss this game. I'll be playing again some day.			"

												Its a game by Tim Schafer game. If that doesn't sell you, then I guess I'll have to talk about the game.Psychonauts is a platformer that has collectathon elements, powers, and a ranking system, as well as a large hub world. The main chunk of the game and gameplay takes place inside the minds of individuals around the psychics' camp,calling Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp.The characters are the best part of this game. This game is amazing in every aspect, but the characters are easily the best part of it. They're quirky, they have their own permanent personalities, they have backstories told through slideshows within that person's level, they are full of life and are portrayed so well by their respective voice actors that you never get the sense that they're people in a room recording lines of dialogue, you get immersed into the world of the psychonauts and the characters slowly have their affect on you. They also teach you valuable life lessons (for instance, control over emotions and saying that you cannot lock it completely away, or you'll explode inside Sasha Nein's marksman training). Honestly, the rest of the game works as well as any other decent 3D paltformer/collectathon, and I can't help but comparing it to Conker's Bad Fur Day, but with fewer curse words. It functions well and would otherwise not stand out, but because of its writing and its characters (and in Psychonaut's case, its art style too. CBFD looked a lot like Banjo & Kazooie). Its powers are neat and the premise is certaintly unique, but the characters really bring this game to life.Double Fine Productions are similar to Vigil games, as many of their games are huge cult classics, that weren't huge at their release, but have over time garnered a huge following. I just hope Double Fine doesn't go the way of Vigil.Overall, I highly recommend it to any 3D platforming fan. Its quirky, it pokes fun and its overall a blast to play. 10/10 from me, Double Fine. I cannot wait for Psychonauts 2 to come out in...2018, supposedly...I just hope its worth the wait and meets expectations			"

												Maybe I might be nostalgia tripping, but Psychonauts takes everything good from great games like Banjo-Kazooie and Super Mario 64 and does it much better. It is a very well fleshed out game, if you can get with the very unique artstyle. At any rate it is a much better story telling game, than the aforementioned - going into darker jokes and providing better context for levels with actual plot motivations. It is a great game of it's class, definitely worth trying out. My only gripes, was having to adjust the controls for mouse and keyboard, and that the collectables are flat-alpha-ed planes that are very easy to miss when looking at them from the wrong angles.

												This game is pure magic. Storytelling worthy of a film, warm, intelligent humor, and challenging action and platforming. It's stood the test of time. If you haven't played it, do. If you have, give it a replay.			"

												Psychonauts is a 3D Platforming game that is very creative and fun! ... and pretty weird. If you really like 3D Platformers like in the good old days, you'll definitively like it! Oh and I don't know why, but when there's a sale, this game is like 2 or 3 dollars, so you can get a really good game for really cheap!			"

												Everyone should try this game! It takes everything worthwhile from the 3D platformers of its age, improves upon the forumla with fun abilities, and adds an interesting story on top of it all. I'll admit, the main character looks a bit weird, but don't let that deter you! Instant classic, right here.			"
