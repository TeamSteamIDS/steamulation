												Project Aftermath isn't the most beautiful game out there, but it does hold its own for a strategy game.  While it's nothing like command and conquer or other RTS games, in the fact that you do not need to build up a base, but instead control several ""heroes"" which have a few units of their own.  So you control these groups, giving them each orders.  Even though the units are simple, just single groups, there is an extra strategy element that makes this game unique.  There are 4 different type of weapons and shields.  Red, blue, green, and yellow.  Each group can have a melee weapon and ranged weapon of a certain color.  So a red gun with a blue melee, or whatever combination you'd like.  The enemy and yourself have a shield of a certain color.  That means that they are shielded to a certain extent to that weapon.  So if a person has a blue shield, hit him with a green, red, or yellow weapon.  Heroes have special abilities too.  These can either attack the enemy, make them more vulnerable, increase a group skill, or heal the group.It's not the most polished game, but it is fun.  I would characterize it somewhere around a simplified XCOM (original) thats real time instead of turn based.			"

Project Aftermath is a sort of mash between a modern MOBA and classic RTS games such as Command & Conquer. The game requires the player to control a number of heroes who come with their own small squad of soldiers. Upon death the hero can be revived. There is a limited amount of strategic options such as changing weapon type in accordance to the enemy's defence type, what special skills the heroes can use in any given situation that may reinforce an ally's offence or provide support to a hero's team. It's also possible, and encouraged, to consider what order to carry out attacks and movement.The menu interface in this game seems to purposefully take precedence over everything else on my system. I have a dual-monitor setup and I generally stream television shows whilst playing games. Project Aftermath is the only game so far that seems to cause the video stream to stutter and eventually stop buffering while browsing its in-game menus. everything then appears to resume working as expected during gameplay.There are no visual settings and minimal gameplay options but there is a volume mixer. There really needs to be keybind menu as I'm finding that the camera rotation with Q and E often fails, I would prefer to rebind them to my hero's skills.Even though Project Aftermath plays well it's a bit too bland and clunky, for a pseudo-RTS, to keep me interested.

												Real time strategy. Controls feel clunky, you got minions that are not under full control, they will orbit your ""hero"" and attack on their own. Graphics look extremely outdated. Feels more like a tower defense than a rts.			"

												This is a C&C game (Command and Conquer), not too polished, but it still has the charm, Definitely not worth the $10 price tag, if you want a good C&C game, get red alert 3, I did, and I found it a much more polished game, with better graphics, and better music. Only problem is that it's on origin, though I think it is also on Steam too. I got it during a humble bundle hosted by EA.			"
