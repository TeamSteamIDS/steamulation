												After purchase you can play this as a MOD within the Arma 2 AND Arma 3 games to keep the multiplayer functionality and provide many many visual and gameplay improvements. Go to the official Bohemia Interactive forums and check the threads ""Iron Front as mod in Arma 2: Combined Operations"" and ""Iron Front as mod in Arma 3"". This is a very lovely tribute based on the Arma 2 engine. You will enjoy all the richness of features - open world scenario with an editor for unlimited possibilities. All troops and vehicles are high quality and high in detail. Weapon and vehicle sounds are also pretty decent. Playing the mission ""Normandy crossing"" gave me that immersion, only the Arma series can provide. Laying there with my team at dawn, covering in the grass and behind bushes. Looking at the wonderful colors of the sky, listening to the beautiful soft wind breeze around our helmets and for a short time I remember how it was playing in the wilderness as a young kid. But then reality forces me to focus ont the gravel road to the west. My team hears it - I hear it. There it is. The terrifying whistling and twittering of German tank tracks coming closer and closer. They are less than 200 meters away, but we still have no visual contact. Oh god, save our souls. I order my team to hold fire. Then we have visual contact to a German halftrack fully manned with troops. I know, that the only possibilitiy to survive, is to take out the gunner first, because he can erase our whole team with one single blast. They come to a halt, just 50 meters away from us. This is our chance! Quickly I focus on the gunner and order my members 2 to 5 to attack him, the rest of my team will handle the two guards on foot to the left and right, Open fire! Lucky us, the gunner and guards drop immediately, but the whole squad now disembarks the halftrack, running for cover. A fierce battle ends as we empty our last mags into the one Kraut calling for reinforcements. We check the dead Germans for ammo, gear and weapons and say goodbye to our fallen comrades. Suddenly we are shocked to death. There it is again. The whistling of death....			"

												I bought this because I play alot of ArmA 2. I liked and played Red Orchestra 2 a bit too but RO 2 just left me wanting something deeper. I've read alot of negative reviews but I have to say that this is a great game for alot of reasons.The first things that's gonna hit you is that it's really just ArmA 2 set in WW2 but all the things that made ArmA 2 great make this game great too. There are thousands of little hidden surprises to discover.Sure there werent alot of people in servers but just like ArmA 2 i just created my own offline server and the game filled it with bots just like Arma 2. For me that means infinite replay value. (and thats before i even get to the campaign or scenarios.)Some people say this game is more system heavy but it looks just like Arma 2 to me...what i did notice was that the game lagged out on the Normandy D-day scenario...just too much going on for the game to handle..everything else ran fine though.The skins and weapons look fantastic and flying those ww2 fighters is more fun than ever...youd swear you were playing IL2 sturmovic.Straight away I can see that this game is going to give me months of single player replay value just like ArmA 2.Many people complain about jittery controls on the Arma Games...all i can say is that if you have a decent PC and dial in the game then it runs smooth and accurate. I always turn of all post processing and anti liasing, mouse smoothing etc because I want the controls to be as fast and accurate as possible. The game still looks great and it's as responsive as any FPS if you do that.This game really is a real WW2 simulator. Open world and huge. All the things that RO2 aspired to be but didnt quite achieve.Like any game there will be the odd bug or two but I'm very glad i got this game (in the christmas sale)Yes..you will probably have trouble finding online players but if like me you just wanted single player with infinite replay value then this game definitely hits that mark. Personally I don't care if nobody knows about this game, to me it just makes it one of those hidden gems that is enjoyed by a select few. I've not played the 1944 Arma 2 mod people are referring to here, but now that I have this game I dont see why Id need to...this game has everything I wanted.			"

												Look for the game on sale ,The infantry  combat is not so good .But if you like tanks and amour and planes the game is well worth it .Some epic ww2 tank battles can be made and lots of community created missions of  historical tank battles from ww2 eastern front .Ohh and like  arma make sure you got a good cpu and dont think a laptop will do the job :)			"

												Don't bother, you won't like it even with the awesome community mods and the arma 3 engine boost. There's nothing to see here, only an exceptional and unique WW2 experience for hardcore and softcore players alike. Trust me, the incredible mission editor is not worth the disk space.Just walk away, and tell your friends before they too nearly discover the best kept secret in online shooters.			"

												Iron Front : Liberation 1944 - tactical war simulator based on arma 2 engine and If you like Arma iron front will be interesting game for you .Now i'm gonna say a couple of words about story mode firstly as i think single really sucks and i'm pretty sure that you'll get bored while playing this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥there are so much buggs you can stuck in texture for instanse or just fall down  through this damn earth right into the hell and e.t.c yet some old animations from arma ruin the picture even multiplayer doesn't work anymore but in general this game isn't too bad on the one hand we have buggy single and non working multiplayer and on the other hand good working editor where personally i spent about 90 hours .it gives you opportunity to make some cool screens or just have fun with units in conclusion i can't advise this game to somebody but i'm sure that evry game have his own fans and this one isn't exception .5/10			"

												This is a very misunderstood game. Forget the campaigns, forget the multiplayer (sadly), if you're competent with the Arma editor then there is a hell of a lot of fun to be had here. There's an endless amount of possibilites and you can create the scenarios you've always wanted to see in an Eastern Front title. It's more immersive than any of the Arma titles and the maps are incredible.			"

												(My playtime is significantly longer than here on Steam.)To make this clear at the beginning: I like this game, though it suffers from two major problems.-The first one, and the biggest one for me, is that since the Gamespy was shut down, online multiplayer no longer works in Iron Front. BUT, if you own ArmA 3, using third party software known as ""Play with six"", content of Iron Front can be shared with ArmA 3 which means the multiplayer can be played again (although I have not tested this option yet, so I cant tell if there are many servers running). If ArmA 3 isnt in your game library, you can play it with friends only using LAN (hamachi too).-The second one are the bugs. Game itself works perfectly - what I love most about all ArmA games (including Iron Front, which is practicaly the same) are mission editor and multiplayer with community made scenarios. I dont play developer-made missions much, because they have always included bugs which prevents you from completing them. This applies to Iron Front even more. Campaign is so horribly broken, that you cant even get past the training, if you are lucky, then you will end up in the first chapter without being able to continue due to the bad scripting.So to put this short:Pros:-ArmA 2 that is set in World War II-Quite satisfying content in terms of vehicles, weapons and units (excluding planes, for example only one fighter for Luftwaffe)-Realism...and all the things that make ArmA goodCons:-No online multiplayer in vanilla version-Campaign and missions bugsMy conclusion: If you like ArmA playstyle and WW2, buy Iron Front on sale and you will like it.

												Much like the ARMA series, this game is riddled with bugs and could look pretty unrefined at times. This is where the series faulters, however......we still love the heck out of it. For me, ARMA is one of the greatest series that have been developed, and Iron Front is another great example of what the Real Virtuality 3 engine can offer. The game runs and performs almost identical to ARMA 2; same interface concepts, same mechanisms, same method of processing, however it's set in the time of World War II with different weaponry and scenery. It's a very solid game and if you enjoy the ARMA series, you will certainly love this. It's unfortunate that GameSpy took this game down with it, so really the only way to enjoy this with friends is through LAN or converting the mod to ARMA 2 using this[forums.bistudio.com] thread.

												This game was ok for it being on the Arma 2 engine, i bought it a few years ago and at that time there wasnt large online community. If you have played arma 2 then you should know that the infrantry are going to be clunky, it seems like most of the better animations went into the tanks and thats a good thing. also a few intresting notes is that the DLC for it seemed like it was rushed, at least the audio aspecs, the US dialouge and weapons are low quality. Also some people compare this game to the 1944 mod for Arma 2, the Arma 2 mod usually get updated compared to this game that seems like steam wont update it anymore. Also this game lacks mod support, so you cant add stuff.Pros: WW2 Eastern front, Tank combat, maps are large. Cons: Lack of online community, Clunky combat, i would have to give this a 6/10 it could have been made better.			"

												7.8/10+Realistic+Massive Maps+Extremely Customizable+Intense Combat-Clunky Controls-Dumb AI-Graphical Inconsistancies  I think this game gets too bad of a reputation from those who pick it up for the first time. Let me preface this with a couple of things: Yes, it does have bugs, Yes it does have graphical inconsistancies (Low res textures, shoddy character modeling, etc), Yes, it does have a complicated control scheme, and yes the AI isn't exactly top notch. With all of this in mind I still would recommend this game; not to players who are familiar with fast paced shooters like Team Fortress, Call of Duty, Battlefield, or anything like that, but to those who are looking for a realistic, stategical, satisfying tactical experience. Let me address the first problem many players complain about: The control scheme. To be honest, I don't get what the big deal is. I mean if we are talking bare-bones-pick-up-and-play-with-no-prior-knowledge-of-the-controls gameplay, you WILL find that it is a bit clunky, but if you stop and go to the settings, you can customize the control scheme virtually to any way you want. There are a lot of actions that you will not use, so simply map those away from the main controls. You have the ability to map buttons to the same command, making them toggleable. So realistically, just map the controls to the way you are used to them and everything will be fine.This game offers an assortment of different units, guns, and vehicles to play with. All are historically accurate and accuratly designed. The sound captuing is a little iffy, as most weapons sound the same. This game drops you in the shoes of either a German soldier, or a Russian soldier (or an American if you buy the DLC). The maps the missions take place in are rather huge, and the gameplay time from mission to mission can vary from 10 minutes, to 2 hours, depending on how you play. The  battles feel very realistic. This game can prove to be very difficult to those who like to run out into the open and play super hero. The good/ bad thing about that, is that you will have to start from the last checkpoint if you die, so this game forces you to move slowly and assess the situation.You are in control of your AI team mates most of the time. This is the only instance where the controls, for me, got clunky. To select a unit, you will push the F1-F12 buttons, and to issue a command, you will find it by pushing the 1-0 keys. In the middle of a firefight, this can become tedious, and will often result in you either picking the wrong command, or scrolling through the number keys to find the command. It also doesn't help that the AI react slowly, so if you tell them to hit the dirt, or give suppressive fire, they will think about it for about ten seconds before acting, but this is only when there are many units on the field at once.While I do not have the patience to describe every aspect of the game, I can tell you that this game has flaws, but if you are looking for a good, strategic game, this is the one to buy. It needs work, and I hope they make a second one with fewer bugs. "

												Anyone looking for an accurate layout of Omaha beach will probably be disappointed with the D-Day DLC.  Although the map of the St.-Laurent sur-Mer area looks pretty accurate, it fails to translate to the ground (have been there personally). There is also a strange island off the shore and there are mountains visible where it should be only ocean. Also, there is no map of the areas involved in Airborne operations.  Other than that, the game is a great WII shooter with the feel of ARMA.			"

												My expireience with iron front was pretty great, i am a ww2 buff and a fan of arma so as you can imagine i was drawn to iron front pretty quickly. so, the game is fun, realist and if you can play arma(stand the minor bugs) you can play this. the graphics look pretty nice on higherst setting and the maps are huge. Also the animaitons are redone(unlike arma2 where the bold magically reloads without moving) and tanks have a more realist crew(front gunner, loader) and you can tow artillery(pak 40 AT gun for example) and infantry can ride tanks. The editor is quite good and the game has a larger focus on areield combat that arma.Overall it is a great game and not as buggy as everyone thinks			"

												This game is probably one of the top 10 best ww2 games out there and if you like WW2 games then this game is one that i think you should get. the Graphics are quite high compared to other ww2 games. but since 2014 the multiplayer has unfortunately shut down. This was due too Gamespy shutting down completely and Iron front was actually using Gamespy for its servers. The developers  actually abandoned this game in 2012 so they did not fix the Multiplayer issue. BUT if you download the Iron Front Arma 3 conversion tool or better still, you buy Arma 3 and install the free Iron Front Lite then you are able to acces multiplayer and still play this awesome ww2 game.

												Better then Arma but since the game spy shut down multiplayer is kinda hard to play now.  Which was one of the best things on this game.   Anyone that has a massive server and group still add me!  The games singalplayer can be fun if you know how to make maps.  Making a simple map is not that hard at all really.  I do like it more then Arma.  Deaths arnt so crapy looking.  Just look up senarios online or use your imagenation to make a small simple map or a huge lag fest battle and have fun.  This gmae should get more credit, but I will say it can be a time consumer when making a nice map.  However its pays off most of the time.EDITIf you get Hamatchi you can still play with your friends now.  It's easy to set up and I do really suggest this game.  This game is way better than Arma 2 was, the only thing they did wrong with this game was not advertise it enough! I got back into this game recently and man I missed it.  I wish they would have kept updating it.			"

												This game, I have to say... Is quite amazing, because it never ends. I just couldn't stop making more and more maps and having lots of fun. I mean, you can do anything! Seriously! I thought I would need to spend Hours making a map. Nope, Four already made, with Hours and hours of walking to walk around it. I then think ""Man, it will be hard for Waypoints for them to Atatck and such"" I placed them down, I could command them all myselves, then noticed I placed a person a rank higher, who ordered me to Mount the PAK-40 to Destory enemy planes. It got Boring, so I added Airplanes for both sides, which Bombed the Hell out of our new Officer, which placed me in charge of our Fatherland! I ordered a Full-Scale assault on the Russians which we knocked the Hell out of them, we had the Red Baron in the Sky taking out the Russian Bombers, and we had a Moterized crew securing the Village. I could add loads more of enemies into each Village, and then spend Hours, maybe even a few Days irl playing this because of how much you can do. Its just so much fun, and its easy to place things down too, and there is much to Explore, like how I found this one DLC, now I can Fight Americans too! I am going to spend Months playing this, and when I do Accomplish everything, I am going to look for Mods too. You need to get this! This is your dream! #BestWW2BattleSimmulatorOfAllTime			"

												What will you get when you take most of the bad things in Arma? This game. The Campaigns (German and Russian) are horribly bugged, cutscenes are awful and laggy and you are most likely not to get past mission 4. There is no multiplayer, well thats what i heard or that there are some servers that you can connect trough hamachi or equivalent and possibly you can create lan servers. For me, pressing the multiplayer button in start menu crashes the game :) And the ai is just terrible, if you have an ai driver in a vehicle, put the kettle on, this is gonna last awhile. What a huge disappoitment for a fan of WWII and Arma series.Ive summarized some pros here:Authentic tanks, planes ands weapons from WWIID-day dlc is now free for buyers of the game itself(!)The editor!Single missions, couple in the original game, several from the dlc. These seem to work.			"

												Yup I am recommending this game.  Hopefully the Iron Front Revival Project will fix the issues left behind. EDIT:  Updated review.  Highly recommend this game especially since the conversion went through.  Not only are you able to play Iron Front as a mod in Arma 2 CO but Arma 3 also.  Now that it runs as a mod in Arma 2CO/Arma 3 this allows you to use other mods to enhance your game play even more.  There are even more mods made for the Iron Front conversion available at Iron Front Fans Forum, ex: new units and weapons, bombing fix, graphical and AI etc.			"

												This is an amazing alternate to ArmA 2, well in my opinion (I'm a bit of a WWII Fanatic) but it does require careful planning and strategy. The D-Day Add on really adds to the game, it includes fixing a few bugs and a lot more scenarios. The scenarios, instead of focusing on infantry most of the time, have the player playing as a commander of a platoon of M4 Shermans hunting Tiger tanks in the middle of the night. The other scenario (this one is my favorite) puts you in the boots of a Colonel commanding basically a battalion. But anyway the original storyline is fun but I tend to appreciate the German storyline better. If you buy the game you might agree with me. But the Russian one is fun too, but your first encounter after the tutorial tends to be quite annoying. But either way I recommend this game to anyone looking to buy it.			"

												Bought this to play in Arma3 If they had sold this just as a Tactical WW2 Tank simulator while online play was still available they could have cleaned up. Its surprisingly good at  that side of things. Built on the Arma2 engine, not a mod, and not to be confused with other Arma WW2 mods. Recommended more for hardcore Arma fans than casual gamers though.owners of Arma 3 can play Iron Front in Arma3 via play with six. That means multiplayer as well as better graphics, and its been made available for easy install in Six with the approval of the game devs and BI studios for existing owners of Iron Front.Apart from that its basically Arma in WW2. The usual Arma controls we have all come to love and hate, the arma engine warts and all, clunky AI, but plenty of addons and user created missions and scenarios, and the familiar arma editor.Note that there are ""lite"" (free, lowe res graphics) versions of Iron Front you can try before you buyTL/DR: single player or LAN only - no multiplayer support. Other good Steam WW2 are availalable (R02, Rising Storm, etc). Very worthwhile to play in Arma3.			"

If you've played Arma or want an idea of what it's like, then this game is a good place to start. Command a tank crew, lead a squad, or even pilot a fighter plane.

												This is a very good first person shooter and tank simulator. Also adding to the feel of realisme is that the missions at the German side can actually be done in the German language. The dialogues are in real time (no dubbing or sychronising) german. Very well done by the game makers. It is based on the Arma engine. So that can be quite demanding on the hardware and smoothness of the game. But the games can be very entertaining. Because of the realisme factor you will not find that many brainless bunnyhopping teens here. So it is a very good game and I recommend it to anyone interested in World War 2 combat.			"

												This game is alright if you can get past by the bugs(restarting the mission or checkpoint occasionally)yet if you are a patient person you could work with the editor and create a custom scenario, either a skirmish in a Russian town or a full frontal assault on the Beaches of Normandy. This game brings the realism of the Arma engine with the immersion of WWII.REMEMBER: This game will eventually get buggy at some point so be warned "

												Two points are awarded for major features and one point is awarded for minor features of the game (positive or negative points).Pros• Graphics - Models, textures and other graphical details are very good; looks almost as beautiful as ArmA II does. It is obvious that the developers put a lot of time, effort and heart into the game (even though there quite a few bugs).• Mission Editor - Great mission editor (if you're familiar with the one from ArmA II, then you'll know why).• Co-op - This game features quite a few co-operative missions and there are plenty of high quality co-op missions made by the community.• Moddable - A lot of people here may, probably, disagree with me here and say that modding is not supported, but that's just half of the truth. The truth is that you can import the game into ArmA II, and ArmA II is moddable.Cons• Sound Effects - Some sound effects are pretty terrible, such as the Kar98k and Mosin-Nagant (which is a shame since they are the two most widely used weapons in the game)• Voice Acting - The voice acting is pretty meh, but what pisses me off the most is the Russian voice acting; the quality of the microphone that was used to record the Russian voice actor's voices is atrocious. The voices sound fuzzy and have a lot of artifacts.• Small Multiplayer Community - If you're into multiplayer and multiplayer only, I don't recommend that you get the game for that as the multiplayer community is very small.

Those are men who have lost their minds.Planes handle amazingly; all around expirences so far have been white knucled AF; on all levels of combat.

												This game is a lot of fun and I'm a huge fan of the genre. I've played Arma 2 for many hours, and feel like I can play this one for the equal amount of time. There are a lot of problems though.Pros:Very fun if you like the genre.You can sometimes be killed by stray rounds, like in real war.It can't really be scripted to be exact, meaning anything can happen any any time. Murphy's Law is here.You can play with a different guns vehicles etc. You can play with both airplanes and tanks in the same battle.(Also infantry.)My favorite_____The editor lets you build any game you want. You want a massive tank/plane/infantry battle with 200+ guys on each side, you can do it. Do you want to make a mission where you assassinate a Nazi/Soviet/American leader, you've got it.CONS: Terrible engine, just like the others in Arma 2 etc. Glitches happen way too often. One time I set up a massive game air/land battle between Soviets and Germans. I was playing as a Soviet Rifle men when I noticed German tanks 20 feet from me, yet no had fired a shot. Neither side lost any men, even though they went right by each other. I ran across the field and shot a German soldier, and none of his friends even reacted. They just laid there while I executed them in the middle of a field surrounded by other Germans with rifles. Needless to say a glitch made the armies ignore one another.The grenade system is poor. It feels like the Devs got a little lazy on the creating vehicles front. There are only two airplanes types per nation. The Sherman is used by Soviets and Americas, even though the Soviets have none of the KVs. Americans only have the Sherman as a tank. I've seen mods created by average Joes that are leagues better than this entire game. There are also no mods, because the devs thought it was a bad idea or some stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

The campaign is amazing but it has few bugs which makes you use a code ""endmission"" because you get stuck in middle of a mission because some objectives most of the time won't trigger. If you own Arma 3 this game can be used as a mod.			"

												Two weeks in the jungle near Vietnamese-Cambodian border is a nightmare. During the monsoon season, it's just a hell. You walk around, trying to bypass the traps, you keep your eyes out on enemy snipers. At some point you start to have enough of all this, thinking if wouldn't it be better if you just got shot. So far, only one thing could stop those thoughts. Back in base you hear the magical word: ""mail"". You rush to get your weekly letter from your girl back home. You grab it like a treasure and take to your quarter. You open it, read carefully and... can't believe. She found another guy. A pacifist♥♥♥♥♥from Chicago. At first you're angry, you want to destroy the world, but soon after you realise, you can't actually do anything. All you got left is disappointment and crushed hopes. This is exactly the same what I experienced with this game. Bugs, bad netcode, and riddiculous license issues that makes modding nearly unable, virtually killed the game. All I got now is disappointment...			"

												It was a great idea. Sadly that is about where it stopped. It came out too late in the lifespan of Arma 2 which its engine is borrowed from. There are some issues here and there. The playerbase never really took off. When the Gamespy servers went down it was a the bullet to the head for this game. It's a shame.			"

												People have complained that this is just ""ArmA 2"" in the Second World War. They also complain that there are ""too many"" WWII themed games. They also just got ArmA 2 for Day Z. While it's true there was a time when WWII settings were popular, this was late 90s, to mid 2000s, spurred on by the success of MOH:AA and the first CoD. When CoD struck gold with MW, the emphasis went to modern warfare and then when L4D did the same, now we have zombie titles as far as the eye can see. So, in otherwords, these people are morons.So, Iron Front is $29.99. A fair price. What do you get from it? The best incarnation of the ArmA 2 engine and a much more well developed experience than ArmA 2, especially in regards to vehicles combat. They optimized their game very well and are clearly lovers of the history here. The hardware, all of it, is pain-stakingly detailed and accurate. The powerful ArmA 2 mission editor is there, the AI is improved, it's all an improvement on ArmA 2. For $29.99? Yeah, this is all worth it. An obscure theatre in WWII is welcome and the developers have already released DLC for it. Two campaigns covering the Soviet and Wehrmahct forces in both English and their native languages. The developers are history buffs and did the subject matter due justice without showing any overt bias to any faction. If you love sims, if you love more realism in you games, this is one you honestly should get. It's clearly made BY history buffs FOR history buffs.			"

												As far as having a virtual WW2 battlefield this game delivers.  The single player campaign is lacking though.  Its worth a punt but it's clumsy, but it does have its moments.The real single player benefit is generating your own battles.  The ability to jump from different player positions is awesome;  for example, it is easy to set up a defence of various German emplacements, be it Pak guns, machine guns, tanks, squads etc,  than let the Russian onslaught commence.  If one position you are manning is destroyed just move on to another unit. Tank battles are particularly good and make up for the lack of decent WW2 tank games.  Especially as you can quickly mould a battle as you wish in teh editor.  Need another bunch of T34's ?  It takes seconds to add them to the mission generator. Graphics are good too.  At times photo realistic. If you are into WW2 stuff, and long for the ability to recreate WW2 battles with numerous tanks, guns, planes and inftantry this game is for you.  Just dont reply on the single player missions. This game deserves more kudos in my opinion, I highly recommend it. "

												Iron Front : Liberation 1944 is a pretty nice looking total conversion for the ARMA 2 engine. The majority of the unit graphics are debatably nicer than that of some vanilla ARMA 2 units. Likewise, most of the units available in Iron Front : Liberation 1944 look authentic and there is a fair amount of equipment from late in the war. Sadly, these are the only real compliments that come to mind when I think of this ""game.""So what's the real problem here? Well, first off: The AI is pretty anemic. A hallmark n00b gripe with ARMA is that of the omnipotent and almighty - ""Uber Cheaty"" - AI (with eyes in the back of their collective head.) Sadly, this isn't the case for the AI in Iron Front : Liberation 1944... In fact a major complaint about this ""game"" is that the AI is dumber than a box of rocks and as a long time (since 2001) ARMA player, I'd have to disagree... Despite the fact that Iron Front : Liberation 1944 is built on the ARMA II engine and despite the largely identical command menus, I feel as though something was lost during the total conversion... So much so that the AI in Iron Front : Liberation 1944 appears to be dumber than a dump truck load of boulders.As an example: I watched two opposing tank platoons pass right by one another without firing a shot. Being the commander of a lead tank, it was my experience that the command menu in Iron Front : Liberation 1944 is almost completely useless. Due largely to the inept, incompetent and insubordinate nature of the AI in this ""game.""After watching the enemy tank column pass by my platoon at point blank range, I tried giving each of my tank gunners their own specific targets. No results... Ok, well how about each of you try opening fire? No? Not interested? Ok... Maybe we can all just stand around, hold hands and discuss how we feel? Would you like to do that? Guess not...Don't worry though, the AI's lack of sighting, reporting and automatic engagement skills isn't likely to result in any casualties... Realistically, I don't think that any of the AI driven units in the ""game"" actually pose a threat to the player. However, I do think that boredom is a serious threat to anyone who plays Iron Front : Liberation 1944. Which brings me to my final point, is this a ""game"" or a ""paid total conversion mod?"" As a standalone game, the AI is pretty lacking, there is no default CTI mode and the majority of the maps are pretty small... Even if you consider this as a paid total conversion mod of ARMA II - it lacks the depth of content you're likely to find in some unpaid addons, mods / total conversion for the various versions of ARMA...Which ever way you approach this - I think that if you really want an ARMAesque, WWII experience, you would be better off finding your own collection of WWII addon units and maps for ARMA I, II or III...---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Is Iron Front : Liberation 1944 a decent, large scale land / air WWII sim?Absolutely! If you could consistently get enough players together for huge multiplayer battles it would probably be a pretty fun game.Is Iron Front : Liberation 1944 a complete ARMA II experience set in WWII?Nope... Too much functionality and challenge was left behind... The reason the ARMA series has been so successful has been its community, both in terms of players and content makers... Which is something that Iron Front : Liberation 1944 currently lacks.Unless you've got money to burn - this game is a pass.			"

Even on the lowest setting it is really laggy and in addition to that the game is full of bugs and is not even in an alpha type release. To rip you off more they had released the DLC making you pay for more before this game is even finished.

												Okay, lack of content though due to the business model of the Dev. Other games using this engine have thrived due to the modding community. Dev's idea was to forbid modding and instead release paid for DLC... which in the end was FREE anyway as the community died. Don't get it. ARMA 2 with mods would allow you to create a far more immersive WW2 experience as the range of weaponry/vehicles in this title are limited... a problem which could have been resolved by the community simply filling in the gaps left by the greedy Dev.

												Iron Front is a simulator, not counter strike and not Call of Duty. It's a WW2 simulator with the focus on infantry tactics. You can use tanks, vehicles and planes, but they're not 1:1 simulated. Good, but not prefect.The power of Iron Front comes from the close to real approach of the correct presentation of all uniforms, ranks, languages (with dialects) and human dialogs.The game shows you, during the campaign, that war is no place for heroes and that you're as good as dead if you think that you're the best fps gamer in the world, because you know how to play candy strike ehm..sorry..counter strike.If you like hard core gameplay, stick to this. Many features, many options, but brutal as hell. If you want to brag about you kills and upgrades, stay away. There're none in this game. And it does matter if you kill some one to make sure he's alone. You don't want to fight a squad of angry soldiers on your own.NOTE: You do need a rather high-end game rig for this game, otherwise it won't run smooth enough. But, if you got that.. Nothing stands in your way to enjoy this Red Orchestra killer. Ofcourse, all a matter of taste, but this is my nr. 1 favorite World War 2 Co-Op Simulation.			"

There are only 2 issues with the game in my opinion: the campaigns are pretty short and lackluster and the online community is ABSOLUTELY DEAD.			"

												Note:This reviewer had this mod a long time ago.Iron front 1944 is both a standalone game and mod for the ARMA engine.Pros:Well detailed military equipmentsRealismRealistic vehicle simulation, damage model, penetration (more realistic than ACE2 in this field)ARMA features (easy to familiar;like the editor)Replayability (you can make missions/screw around in editor)Cons:Somehow lacking (only USSR and Germany  and only items used in 1944..where's my Yak planes?)Requires good CPU, since it's based on ARMA engineMod is bit incompleted (look at allies/observers tab; some aircraft guns having same sound)I wouldn't recommend buying it regularly, but it's worth it on sales especially if you're a arma fan.I've heard that the multiplayer is dead, but it's still fun to mess with the editor.

												One of the ugliest game I've ever played. ArmA 2 uses this same engine but this game has bigger issues with performance (even on high-end PCs) and distance of drawing objects is a joke. For example when I'm looking at the man who stands 10 metres away he looks like character from minecraft. AI is stupid, so even if game is realistic you can't feel immersion because your enemys and allies are completly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. One good thing about this game is mission editor. In conclusion, this game is just ArmaA 2 reskin with bad optimalization and idiotic AI. "

												I don't recommend this game becasue its crontrols are clunky, the weapons are displayed poorly, the cutsense do for about 20 minutes, when the characters talk there mouths are closed like there aren't talking, when you zoom with the guns you don't aim down sight instead your firing from the hip, there are big graph problems like when you get close to something it looks like a thing but when 5 meters it looks like a junk graphs, when you shoot a ally they act like they were fine and they're just dying, I like the trailers and the cutscenes sometimes but trailers and cutscenes don't tell that a game is good, what I like about this game that it had a great interest in telling a story of WWII and its events and battles. I love WWII games but ths is probollly the worst one I've ever played in my whole life. You can look at how long my friends and I have played and the highest is 2 hours on my friend Syntax_Error752.

Make war! Or fail trying!""General! Italy just entered the war!""       - ""No problem, send two divisions to stop them!""""But  General! They're on our side...""        - ""That's even worse! Send them an army!""After that joke of a german soldier at the very beginning of the game, things start to get ugly. And by ugly I refer to the gameplay which kind of reminds me of a walking simulator with broken legs and a strained neck. For example, I didn't even know that it is possible to mess up the simple functionality of looking around... but somehow the devs found a way to do so!""Well ok, maybe it's just me beeing silly..."" I tried to adapt and continued. Meanwhile I enjoyed the really good german voice over that seems pretty authentic (no irony this time, they did a good job on that).Arrived at the shooting range for basic training. After listening to some more propaganda about german war material I received a rifle and suddenly I saw why they fu**ed up the camera controls so badly. Simply because using the mouse does not rotate or manipulate the camera itself as you would suggest, but it lets you drag the imaginary aim point of the rifle across the screen, which is then beeing followed by the first person camera. I don't know why they tried to revolutionize a simple mechanic that has worked perfectly fine in thousands of other games before, but they failed.So already lacking of motivation I tried to convince myself that maybe they where trying to enhance realism, and that's why...Two minutes later I perfectly hit some targets with an unmounted mg42 from a standing position and over a distance of a few hundred meters.I quit the ""game"" and decided to write this review, which was basically more fun than playing Iron Front itself!

												I don't recomend this game for the simple reason that multiplayer isn't avaible anymore, the game uses Arma 2 engine which is poorly optimized unless you've got a powerful computer you won't be able to play the game, tho, there is some good things about this game, if you played Arma 2 and you know its basics, you'll do fairly well in the single player, which is quite interesting as you can play a german story line in a first person shooter, there isn't that many games that give you this option, there are quite a few bugs tho, the IA is quite hard to beat, but overall the game didn't catch the interest of many players and as Gamespy went down, the servers of this game went down with it, so there NO MULTIPLAYER however,  if you are looking for a first person shooter WW2 with a German story line, you might find the game interesting.

												For those like me who love games with Mission Editors, you'll love this game.I discovered this hidden game through the archives of Steam search function.It's made on the same engine as Arma 2, that's a good and a horrible thing at the same time.After hours in Arma 2 I can tell ya, the atmosphere, maps and sounds are almost identical. I like to call this Arma 2: WWII edition.It is better than WW2 mods for Arma 2 though, for there is a lot of units with air, tank and infrantry. There is come classic vehicles missing, but I am happy with the current selection.Multiplayer is dead. If you buy this you buy it solely for singleplayer.Now, to recap, I am recommending this to people who like making their own missions. The mission editor is the exact same as Arma 2, easy to get back into making your own operations.Pick up on sale as I have done, videos will come shortly......			"

												I would say that this is basically a WWII version of ArmA II. In fact, if I didn't know it was a separate game, I'd call it a mod. The developers were too lazy to fix the game when GameSpy died, so there is no multiplayer. Their idea of compensation was a DLC that has no singleplayer campaign. The singleplayer campaign for the base game is cringeworthy anyway...At least the tanks are cool.			"

												A really ambitious game ruined by rubbish controls, glitches and a lousy campaign. This is also a case of taking realism and simulation too far to the point of being unplayable. The first time I played I got shot and didn't die, didn't recover, just got stuck paralysed in a ditch. Not sure if this is a glitch or if that's supposed to happen throughout this game, either seems possible.I really wanted to like this game, I could appreciate the sheer scope and level of detail and historical accuracy involved, a lot of love and time went into making this, but it's just not a finished game. Unless you are willing to put hours of your time into setting up decent custom scenarios that actually work and play well I wouldn't waste your money.			"

It has such promise, and offers the ARMA immersion in a world war 2 setting. Also all the weapons, vehicles, and uniforms appeared to be very realistic. That being said, this game does have its fair share of bugs. My biggest problem was with the graphics, as they appear to require a super computer to run on maximum. I dont have a top of the line gaming comuter, but I can run battlefield 4 at nearly 40 fps. On this game I had to set everything to low to even get around 24fps, and at that point textures were also flickering out and not loading. Simply, it is a great game idea and has the contents to make it really enjoyable, but there  are a few technical issus that can potentially make it unplayable. I wish that Steam reviews had a neutral button becasue that is how I truly feel about this game.			"

												I tried this game back in the day and I liked it. I bought this Digital War Edition for £5 because it was cheap and I think that this game is amazing; it has some bugs (which game doesn't?) but it is a very good simulator and the singleplayer is just amazing. You can create some epic battles on these huge battlegrounds.Take little notice of the negative reviews if you want a World War 2 simulator because this is a brilliant game for just that; the negative reviews are mainly a cause of the original game being very buggy but most of this is now fixed and the game is currently being ""unofficially"" patched through community patches which you can fine on Google.There is also a mod available which allows you to turn this game into a mod for ArmA 3 so you can play this game on the ArmA 3 engine with the new physics and the new graphics; you should check this mod out as it is amazing and I do believe that it allows for you to play the multiplayer as well since it goes through ArmA 3 and not Gamespy (which is shutting down) like this game does.

												 Ursprünglich eine Mod für Arma 2 gewesen, aber aufgrund der Beliebtheit jetzt als eigenständiges Spiel erhältlich. Strategische, anspruchsvolle und äußerst spannende Gefechte an der Ostfront, wahlweise auf russischer oder deutscher Seite. Realismus pur dank dem Arma 2- Grundgerüst. Am besten für Kenner der Arma- oder Operation: Flashpoint- Reihe. Die einzelnen Missionen können sehr langwierig sein und locker 2 - 3 Stunden dauern. Man muss taktisch und im Team vorgehen, Einzelgänger haben keine Chance! Man beginnt als Schütze, muss aber bald seinen ersten Infanteriezug befehligen, und das ist bitter nötig um die Missionen zu erfüllen. Später im Spiel gesellen sich ganze Panzerzüge dazu. Der Spieler kann (und muss) sämtliche Fahr- und Flugzeuge selbst steuern, allerdings sind bei Panzern mehrere Soldaten nötig, da jede Position im Panzer besetzt sein muss, damit er am besten funktioniert. Wer sich einmal in das komplexe Befehlssystem reingefuchst hat, wird mit spannenden und nervenaufreibenden Gefechten in  wunderschöner Grafik belohnt. So gut wurde die Ostfront in noch keinem Shooter umgesetzt! Störend sind höchstens die etwas mangelhafte Wegfindung der KI-Kameraden und gelegentliche amerikanische Sprachsamples (Kein deutscher Landser hätte damals ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥"" oder ""♥♥♥♥!"" gerufen), die noch ein Überbleibsel aus dem ""Hauptspiel"" Arma 2 sind.

												This game is one of the best representations of World War 2 that I have seen. It comes with 2 campaigns right away. Then you can create more and get more off the internet. The game uses arma's engine so it plays just as well. There is not a big community for this game, but there needs to be. You can make multiplayer missions in the editor also. I deffinitly recommend this to people who enjoy realism in games and world war 2 in general. Buy this game!			"

												A lot of people have said this game is half-baked and basically offers the same (or even less) content as ARMA2 mods.  This is true.  The third German campaign mission is ridiculously hard and the first Russian mission glitches at the Zis-3 on the firing range (assumnig you can even drag the gun to the position).That being said, if you want a nice little sandbox in Poland where Nazis and Soviets can fight it out with IS-2 and Tiger II (And Tiger I), then this is the game to get.

												Building on the rather pretty ArmA 2 engine, this game moves the ArmA experience to the second world war.Dedicated ArmA players may already know that scenario from mods like Invasion '44, but here you have a very polished take on the eastern front. It may not be as good as the first Red Orchestra, but it certainly is a lot simpler to get into, and it is a LOT more beautiful.However, like ArmA 2 after release, this game is still full of bugs, issues, and crashes, even though the ArmA 2 engine is running pretty stable, at least I haven't had any ArmA 2 crashes I couldn't explain (since I've been coding some C++ lately, my ArmA 2 has crashed a lot in the past week :P).All in all it seems solid, but constant crashing prevented me from taking a closer look then a few missions into the German campaign.Hands off until the crashing has been patched!

												Whoever created this mess deserves to be sent to the Eastern Front, armed with nothing more than a slingshot.In a nutshell, it is an irritating, frustration-filled series of supposedly interlinked missions which just do not work as they should.For example, in one such mission, which requires the player to take out a Soviet mortar battery, it is possible to casually walk up to said battery and shoot every one of the enemy at pont-blank range and they just stand there like sheep ready to be slaughtered.The next phase in these interlinked missions has you (the player) back at the crossroads ready to defend against advancing Soviet tanks.But hey....no rush....sit down and brew a cuppa coffee or whatever becausethe tanks arrive and just stand there in the road, doing nothing.And so it goes....mediocre follows mediocre.I was looking forward to this game....I like ARMA II and thought that a WW2 campaign based on the ARMA II engine would be a good thing. But I was wrong.Unfortunately the add-on - D-Day - is as bad.I found it impossible to get through the barbed wire after getting off the beach.Reason?Simple: the mines that I was directed to use could not be exploded because there were no detonators.So there I was - crawling up and down that bloody beach looking for a dead sapper who may have had the required equipment to explode the mines to get through the wire.Zilch,It was at this point that I removed the shortcuts from my desktop and consigned this cheap bit of rubbish to the bin. ""Cheap"" because I bought it on the recent special sale.Save yourself some anguish and give this a miss.			"

												　CWCから続く独ソ戦MODの最新作。但し有料かつ本家と互換性なし。　有料なだけあってMAPの作り込み及びアニメーション、車両のダメージモデル等は素晴らしい出来である。しかし極端にユニットの種類が少ない。MODについてもどの程度サポートされているのか不確かな為、$29(2012年夏現在)という本家ArmA2と同じ価格設定は少しどころでなく高過ぎる。　ArmA2というゲームを評価するときにシングルを視野に入れていないので、ゴリ押しゲーとかそういう野暮なことは言わない。あんまり言わない。だがマルチもマルチで本家がMODに大きく依存していたので、購入を考えている人はもう少し待つのも良策だと思われる。			"

												This game its self is unfortunatley dead but if you want to experience what this would have been like or you want to re-live the memories simply get arma 3 and download the Iron Front arma 3 mod (IFA3 Lite) the lite version is free and the full one costs money and the only difference is a slight change in texture quality			"

												Like the concept, based on the Arma series and game engine, however full of bugs and campaign is totally useless, need a huge amount of patching when available. The devs have stop support ages ago, shame because it could have been an awesome game for lovers of WWII.			"

												This probably has to be the worst game I've ever played. Never buy this game. It may look cool but it is glitchy and crap. The AI sucks too.			"

												A really good game, ARMA 2 on the Eastern front with almost everything used by both the armies, the main map is even bigger than Chernarus as well.			"

												 Ursprünglich eine Mod für Arma 2 gewesen, aber aufgrund der Beliebtheit jetzt als eigenständiges Spiel erhältlich. Strategische, anspruchsvolle und äußerst spannende Gefechte an der Ostfront, wahlweise auf russischer oder deutscher Seite. Realismus pur dank dem Arma 2- Grundgerüst. Am besten für Kenner der Arma- oder Operation: Flashpoint- Reihe. Die einzelnen Missionen können sehr langwierig sein und locker 2 - 3 Stunden dauern. Man muss taktisch und im Team vorgehen, Einzelgänger haben keine Chance! Man beginnt als Schütze, muss aber bald seinen ersten Infanteriezug befehligen, und das ist bitter nötig um die Missionen zu erfüllen. Später im Spiel gesellen sich ganze Panzerzüge dazu. Der Spieler kann (und muss) sämtliche Fahr- und Flugzeuge selbst steuern, allerdings sind bei Panzern mehrere Soldaten nötig, da jede Position im Panzer besetzt sein muss, damit er am besten funktioniert. Wer sich einmal in das komplexe Befehlssystem reingefuchst hat, wird mit spannenden und nervenaufreibenden Gefechten in  wunderschöner Grafik belohnt. So gut wurde die Ostfront in noch keinem Shooter umgesetzt! Störend sind höchstens die etwas mangelhafte Wegfindung der KI-Kameraden und gelegentliche amerikanische Sprachsamples (Kein deutscher Landser hätte damals ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥"" oder ""♥♥♥♥!"" gerufen), die noch ein Überbleibsel aus dem ""Hauptspiel"" Arma 2 sind.

												Well this game has done amazingly.........to score 55/100 on the Metascore. Holy Jesus Christ, where to begin with what's wrong? Well we'll start with lack of content, a lack that it would appear is going to go unaddressed for the forseeable future. Long story short they just didn't release this game with enough different units to make it a worthwhile enterprise, mods for Arma 2 had been released with more units and they were ♥♥♥♥ing free. I was daft enough to take my love for Arma 1 and 2 combined ops and allow it to make a very quick decision on a game when not alot of info had been published at the time time and to be honest, apart from a few hours here and there were I've been doing some target practice with tanks, it's been bloody awful. As far as I can see, some of the armour penetration effects and details on the tanks are the only things going for his game, possibly the planes too....but on both counts there are simply not enough. We are talking 1944 here, a year when there was quite possibly the most kit knocking about from tanks to self propelled artillery to jeeps, trucks, halftracks and planes roaring through the skies; but the makers decided to whittle it down to: IS2, T34/85, T34/76, SU85, King Tiger,Panther, P4 and Stug for tanks and assault guns. Tiger 1? Nope. Really hoped we'd see a massive range of weapons and tanks in particular as well as more than 4-5 measley aircraft but no. So, are they doing alot to change this? As far as I can see, no. They decided that whilst the Eastern Side was sitting like a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ that they'd focus their attention elsewhere; what about a Western Front DLC, that'll bring everyone back? Like ♥♥♥♥ing idiots many of us decided to give it a go.....only the Americans are in it which as a Brit is boring (especially as there were over 10,000 more British troops at the D-Day invasions than American) but that was fine I thought, let's see if they've done a good job and see if the fixes have made the game run better. They hadn't and the fixes didn't. Instead what we had was an American side who attacked Russians but not Germans which was ridiculous. So I set about doing some tank target practice. Me in a JS2 vs 5 Shermans at 1500m.  Easy win. Nope. On every occassion I was killed before being able to switch to the gunners seat.....a Sherman that could just about KO a P4 was hitting the frontal armour of a heavy Russian tank that even German heavies feared and lighting it up in 1 shot. Surely not ,so I turned them round and shot them with the 122mm which would have been more the capable of vapourising a Sherman when in tests it penetrated the Panther's frontal armour at over 1600m.......nope. So we've now got an Eastern front unit set that is about 80% unfinished, a game that is poorly optimized (personally I think it's worse than even Arma 2's optimization) and they've released a DLC which is not only a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥that has decided to rewrite the Sherman into the history books as some super tank......but it's not even finished itself! There is literally no content! Don't buy this game, if you've already fallen into the same trap as me, then you have my sympathy, if not and you STILL go and buy it......well then, that makes you a ♥♥♥♥ing MUG. Do the world a favour and don't give these guys a penny for this production. It is catastrophic, boderline criminal.....in fact if we club together and hire a lawyer, we may even be able to claim damages.			"

												I think it's a great game especially if you enjoy ArmA 2 or any other such super tactical shooter. It has good tank on tank battles that are biggest diffrence from ArmA 2. Other than that it's magnificent all around WWII based tactic shooter. I highly recomend it. 8/10			"
