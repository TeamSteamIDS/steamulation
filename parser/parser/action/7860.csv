Once upon a time, Painkiller, Wolfenstein and Bioshock f*cked together and then Necrovision was born...It's nice shooter with old school vibe - bosses, big levels, lots of ammo, puzzles, switches, secret places, etc... The visuals are not top notch, but fits well. The cutscenes and voice acting are TERRIBLE, there are many bugs and glitches, but the game is actualy fun to play and thats where it shines - the gameplay.Nice mechanic is the use of melee combat (and shadohand on later stages), alongside with the pistol. Once the player get the shadowhand, the gameplay is becoming closer to the Bioshock series, cause the different spells, combined with the tipical gun shooting. Controls are little different compared to the Bioshock though - left mouse button for the left hand, right mouse button for the right hand.I said ""combined"", so now is the time to mention the COMBOOOS.Our hero have three types of melee attacks - kick, left hand melee and gun melee attack. The bayonettas and the shovels can be thrown at the enemies to nail them on the wall, the gas lamps exept to light the way, can be used to burn the hordes of undeads and freaky creatures. The arsenal is impressive.It's good to perform different attacks to create combo. For example - knock down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the ground and then finish him out with the pump. Or slice him with the bayonetta for the ""Herr Doktor"" combo.There are different ""challenge rooms"", which becomes avalible after beating any given level. The challenge rooms helps the player to permanently unlock different gear types to be avalible in the inventory.There are parts of the game when the player controls giant mech or even ride a dragon. Yeah, the it's total mashup of many mechanics from different games (there is even bullet time system implemented in it), but it fun to play and it works...for the most of the time.It's not AAA title, it screams ""I'M A CHEAP, LOW BUDGET, SOMETIMES UGLY GAME"", but it's charming in some inexplicable way. So, try it!7/10 "

												Necrovision is a strange game. Stuck between a myriad of styles and influences, it emerges as a blend between the atmosphere of classic world war shooters and the crazy mass murder party of games such as Painkiller, Serious Sam or Bulletstorm. The overall result is highly personal and depends heavily on your mindset: don't go into this game expecting an AAA shooter. You'll find cringeworthy cutscenes, amateurish voice acting, a pixelated GUI and weird bugs all around.However, as soon as you get past its imperfections, you'll be playing a pretty crazy and fun game with a (surprisingly!) relatively readable storyline, zombie beheading, dragons, huge boss fights and lots of other nonsense ♥♥♥♥ happening in WWI. One of the biggest surprises was level design, which, although relatively linear, is huge, well planned enough, often aesthetically pleasing and with a very classic feel and pace.On less positive points, the combo system is pretty bland and doesn't really feel well-implemented (although it can be fun). The weapons are also sub-par: the historical limitations are understandable, but for a game this crazy, they often slow the action to a crawl as you painstakingly bolt your rifle after every shot fighting giant demon things. Health is also a bit weird: medkits exist and are pretty abundant but are close to useless since your health automatically recharges up to about 75%; which breaks some of the classic appeal in my view.Overally, Necrovision is a pretty fun experience if you're willing to forget its technical shortcomings and accept its particular brand of insanity. 7.5/10			"

												I've played Necrovision for an hour now.It's awful.It's so obviously awful.But I'm at a point now where it's so awful that it has somehow become fun.I've been skipping the cutscenes because I don't think I can handle that level of awful - I am but a man - but from what I gather you're George W. Bush and you've been sent back in time to fight off a demonic zombie invasion during The Great War.. Although it may just be a reenactment of The Great War, given the obviously fake German accents. You could still be in Texas, I'm not totally sure.I also couldn't tell you why it's actually fun, but somehow it keeps me playing. It makes no sense, because the gunplay isn't nearly as satisfying as Painkiller, and mostly it just feels like an even ♥♥♥♥♥ier Singularity without the cool time-glove gimmick. It's almost as if it tries to be just a little bit worse than everything else, and somehow that total disregard for quality ends up becoming endearing.It is a consummate B-game. It's digital filth. It should never have been made, you shouldn't be playing it, and that's exactly why you want to.			"

												First game made by Farm 51, not so old, not so young at all. But its for all oldschool FPS players almost legend. It is bug, its looking good (this what Farm made with old Painengine is just ridiculus, that game was looks nice and get nice carnage elements shooting out limbs from screaming people).  Nice mix of storyline, that at end become clear.  Game is a bit to simple in all mechanics (animations etc), but its fun. First War + Vampires + Hell and Demons = good idea, but not all can made it good like Farm 51. This game for me is still a small legend of good carnage FPS with nice storyline and big, darkly locations. 8/10 from me for this game. 2 points was lost for bad animations and old Pain engine  that for 2008 was allredy to weak... but that makeup was briliant and  ragdoll with tottal max carnage andloots of phisical elements... Perfect. Same riting for Lost Company from me.			"

												When people are so excited for Battlefield 1 because it's an alternative World War 1 scenario hardly seen in videogames and managed to get the most likes ever in the history of Youtube......but you're a masochist and you already explored every inch of all trenches kicking German soldiers in the butt, mutilating zombies, defeating giant monsters and ghosts, riding dragons and driving airplanes (Lost Company) and well-armed robots while wearing the Shadowhand which gives you a lot of magic firepower.and brutally killing Satan himselfSuch an underrated title, though. Despite its flaws and mixed reception, I enjoyed it very much.			"

												World War 1 on Steroids, Barely accurate to History, gory as hell, has Magic, Dual Wielding of Weapons and a Shovel as an Weapon years before Shovel Knight made it cool. Gameplay is very Oldschool, avoid the lowest difficulty because you can´t use your Magic Stuff on that one. Runs on the old Painkiller Engine, but on Steroids. It´s an Hidden Gem.Tip for germans: Buy this on the Indiegala Store and you get the Uncut Version!			"

												There isnt much to say if you are fan of Painkiller, it follows the same path, not only bc it uses the same engine but everything similar in term of gameplay, only less enemys are trow at you and few bosses fights and the setting is also diferent.The game relly on its gameplay, since the story doesnt really make sense, but it also isnt what this game is all about, there are many secrets to be found, tough i find this more easy here that in painkiller, and Artifacts give a diferent touch to the gameplay.Voice acting is hilarious and there are a few interesting weapons, a nice change from the shooters we have today, it worth a look.

												This game was better then I ever could have expected! Most fps games are very similar, short, with boring stories. This game brought a whole new level to fps gaming that really impressed me. The story was very good with plenty of cutscenes which many games overlook. Also the FPS is so much fun if a tad on the easy side. Definitely don't play the game on easy. I also enjoyed the wondeful length of it with cool bosses and a weapon system that I fell in love with. The Shadow hand has now become on of my favorite weapons of all time! This was a game that was over underated as it is such a magnificent game! Though I will admit, it is a bit buggy at times but not enough to make unplayable. Definitely play this game and you'll love it just as much as I did! This game needs a new sequal with todays technology, it would be totally epic! So go know and play this game!			"

												Balls to the walls flat-out, in your face straight up engaging captivating and maximal FPS action game -with an interesting overarching storyline with a really, really dark atmosphere with a lots to shoot, experience and lots to see[and hear] too. Really interesting variety in weapons and challenges, enemies and locations in this game. I found that it packed a 'punch' from it's lore which kept me playing through hours I probably shouldn't have been playing playing it in, back in the day. Yes, this game was scary like that and because of it's sound (and possibly graphical ) design -does this to this day (depending on your tolerance to the experience). Story is 'loosely' based on Chaos of war, around Weapons of Mass Destruction and sinister experiments gone horribly wrong, whereby our protagonist survives and gets to experience the about-to-unfold madness firsthand. The story expands from this point on and extravagates (in a fantastic way) into something that is Unique to this genre of Horror/Shooter, at least back in the day it was very unique. Anyhow, if you choose to pick this gem up; Get strapped in for one 'Hell' of a ride.Back in the day one thing that stood out and I loved about this game are the visuals which In My Humble Opinion overall look very nice, even to this day. This aspect helps with the immersion factor, for I wouldn't call the game *realistic* persé but it's sublime sound design (ambiance, voice-acting), dark atmosphere coupled with interesting Character interaction/development throughout the course of the game are worth the money, if not so then the -experience alone is something great to behold, if you are into this kind of thing -that is. ""ze Germans are here, ze Germans are heeree!!!"".One note; If you pick up this game, be sure to check out it's sequel/add-on that is also to be found on this Glorious Steam (not joking) by the name of: Necrovision Lost Company.Thank you,-""HellsWind""			"

												This is a difficult game to review... one of the most difficult I must say. On one point the game is awesome and briliant that you want to shout out: 'PEOPLE PLAY THIS GAME IT IS AWESOME!' and at the same time there are things about this game that are utterly garbage and stupid that make you wanna scream warnings: 'STAY AWAY FROM THIS'This game is hard to get into and easy to bounce off and never try it again. Let me go into some details... the begining is horrible, this aint no Call of Duty shooter that is for sure so people who are rather utter amateurs of this genre will most likely say: this game is f*cked up and unistal, but I am used to difficult FPS games so I just went through it. It gets a bit better later but not perfect and the know how to do stuff in this game aka tutorial is almost non existent which is very bad cause this game has some interesting mechanics that arent typicaly find in most FPS out there. Another bad thing is chaos... there is so much chaos and it gets extremely difficult to grasp with your mind what is happening as you get constantly and heavily receiving damage (luckily this game is more like serious sam/quake/doom style so you can take quite a few hits). Also the storyline is really bad, and actors are quite bad. And there are many glitches and 'something went wrong with the script' moments but I didnt find any game breaking bugs that would ruin the game for me. Yes it is very rough around the edges and you can feel the low buget this game mustve had but at the same time I cannot ignore the many great things this game has that are hard to find in games these days...Despite poor storyline the lore of the game is very good and has a great atmosphere. The whole WWI trenches mixed with horror gore that seems heavily inspired by Clive Barker's style is great, it feels even greater then Return to Castle Wolfenstein horror elements and I would even say that it is slightly better then Bloodrayne. The whole world is dark, dirty and devastated. I really loved the vibe this game has despite the poor storyline.The other thing that is most awesome is fighting and physic model. You shoot off head, arms and legs of human (or human like) enemies. It creates a really juicy gore feel of firefights and gives you the 'sick satisfaction' with every kill. I love zombies, and here there are lot of moments where you fight a horde o zombie german soldiers and with the gory elements mentioned before it creates a mix that for me it has this special charm to it. The overal shooting is really difficuly to adjut but once you start to 'feel' the game more you start to get much more fun from it and that is where I am right now and that is  why despite all the flaws and problems this game has, I must put my thumb up as I found what I came here for, it wasnt pretty and painless but in the end satisfining.I wish they could create a remake of this game where they polish and improve the bad things. Overall the idea behind this game and some feauters are truly uniqe and briliant			"

												One of the wierdest shooters I've ever played. If I had to describe it as briefly as possible I'd say it's DooM set during WWI, with some LOTR mixed in because kraut zombies wasn't strange enough. The first half of the game is a relatively standard period shooter with bullet-sponge opponents; These levels are well designed but drag on a bit. The second half of Necrovision is where things start to shine, as you find yourself dropped into the middle of a compelling underground fantasy realm populated by imaginative (and truly chilling) monsters like gas-mask spiders, flamethrower rat-men, ninja vampires, angry spirits and yes, DRAGONS. The needlessly convoluted story concerns the subjugation of this under-world by demonic forces, who are now spilling over onto the surface. It is here you receive an entirely new set of weapons and a nifty melee super-gauntlet that can be charged with the souls of fallen enemies to unleash powerful explosive attacks. I wish some of the opening missions could be shortened or cut completely to make way for this part of the game, as no doubt many players will be turned off by their first-impression of Necrovision before having a chance to experience the good stuff.Technically the game is rough around the edges, with some maddening difficulty spikes, but worth it for shooter enthusiasts in search of an original premise and oppressive atmosphere.

If you reload and you kick a zombie or person to get them away from you.Reloading will be cancelt so only thing to do is run and try to reload.You have a a lot great weapons even using 2 guns at the same time is possible.Walking on stairs feels like there is a earthquake going on.There is a story line only personally I'm not a big fan of it only it's not bad.Necrovision is maby something for the big FPS fans here on steam.It's not bad if you like weird FPS games try painkiller I prefure that game.I give is a 6/10 score.

												NecroVision is like one of those FPS shooters that stands out of the crowd of your normal everyday-like FPS, features a storyline that is compelling but does need more detail. Good gameplay, with graphixs that are good, and I must say crazy play times. *takes almost an hour to beat a chapter*. Has a good gameplay time  and features a barrage of weapons to use.And a funny main character that is ridiculosly insane.I'd give it 10 out of 11deserves a Gas mask and  a day off the field.			"

												War is Hell, and this game is taking that fact and expanding upon it a metaphorical way. Its WW1 and a crazy kaiser scientist has gone rogue awakening demon vampires to ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up. You play an american soldier who also has an amazing ability to ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up. Gameplay is pretty much classic quake and doom, shoot demon monster soldiers and move on. However there are special sort of combos you can perform with the different weapons to unlock rewards. This helps to keep things fresh. But the WW1 atmosphere is extremely immersive, enough to keep you hooked from the very beginning with your confrontation with sheer insanity. Get this game, at its current price it is more than worth it.			"

												Well I bought this game and the sequal or should I say prequal lost company for under $3. With Verdun , Battlefield 1 , and ad infinitum all being ww1 I decided to but this. I have to say when you get used to the weird weapon selection controls this game is very fun. The Graphics are fine especially for a 2009 game. The weapon models look very well done. The gameplay is sort of like a WW1 doom game. You character is bullet sponge that holds tones of weapons and can jump extremly high. The weapons get pretty absurd with the ability to dual wield MG-08s water cooled machine guns but its fun. I havent finished the game yet but the enamies and the story are interesting + there is alot of voice acting in this game. You do run into a lot of German soldiers as the main enamy but the monsters are pretty varied. From zombies , to ghost and even dragons. The game is fun has has interesting art pieces. Ya buy this game if you want some weird  horror ww1 action.  I am doing a lets play on this game the first episode went pretty bad since the weapon selection controls are a bit weird. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHsHovm-oA3Q4FzCeO6F5NgThere is also a taunt button for some reason.

												Necrovision - one of *those* games that would really worth to be remade from the very basics, because besides of it's ideas it's filled to the brim with terrible choices and implementations. Hitbox, view, weapons, protagonist style, enemy attacks, sounds - so many thing could be improved. Do you really want to play it? Play it. Are you curious if it's generally worth playing? The answer is a really, really solid no.TLDR about mechanics: weapon selection is unreliable, headbob is super nauseating and actively prevents gameplay, level and enemy design is boring + last levels is artifically hard with deadly pitfalls and HORDES or knockback enemies. These make the game an unfair chore instead of a fun, or challenging shooter. The story... let's say it's unique. WW1 happens, then zombies, wraiths, trolls (?)...  a dragon appears, later you defeat mandatory evil german scientist's giant scorpion tank with your walking tank (yes.), only to later realize the vampires, living underground are corrupted by the demons whom Zimmermann allowed into the world, so you have to fight machinegun-wielding vampires, later ratmen equipped iwth flamethrowers while throwing fireballs and stakes out of your magical weapon, only to fight Satan in hell after taking a flying trip with a dragon. YES. THIS IS THE STORY.  I don't know what they were tripping on, but let's just ignore this....Let's say the ideas are okay. But then I'm still left with a game where I can have 6 items cycling on my key 1, later I have magics on 1 (really bad idea, only forward cycling) AND my one-armed guns, and I have to cycle all 4 with my mouse wheel. Meanwhile keys 6-9 are not even used. What the hell....  and if weapon changing troubles wouldn't be enough, there are a lot of melee enemies who attack by dashing ""through"" you, as they constantly clip though you. They shriek, they sometimes not even visible because they are IN you, and you are also experiencing the worst headbob I've ever seen. Using submachine gun in iron sights is a trip for seizure-land, and even just ogres being around means a MASSIVE shaking effect that means useless aiming. And as you fight mostly undeads, headshots are a nice way to kill, otherwise it takes 3-5 times more shots. Now if you add this info together that they can stunlock you because you can't aim...  Then on the final levels when you can even fall down into lava they introduce enemies that jump at you, knocking you back super-hard (while using a stock sound asset), because there are no way to make those levels be more hated than that. If not for the bet/promise that I will finish the game, I would have stopped around chapter 2-3 out of 12...it would have been a definitely better decision.			"

												NecroVisioN is a first person shooter based in world war one with a twist, there is a necromancer creating hellspawns and zombies by the boat load. The game mechanics are old and somewhat clunky, but still work well and are easily adjusted to. The game provides several weapons and ways employ these weapons so that combat is exciting when a new weapon is found. The story is sub-par. The idea of the necromancer is somewhat absurd and steals the idea of nazi zombies from call of duty even thought I am sure that this game came before call of duty: world at war. In the beginning, the game frequently steals the camera from you and stops the action that this game is good at. When you do regain the controls, you feel as if you have shell shock and don't trully know what is happening. While you regain control quickly, it is still disconserting. With in NecroVisioN, there are collectables that tell you more of a story throught letters. But more importantly, there are ""vampire"" collectables that allow you to activate a special power that slows time and increases your effectiveness. This power only comes from killing enemies in specific ways but the easier ones are the best backup for any situation. The voice acting is low at best, but still conveys the meaning behing the words. Over all, NecroVisioN is for the people who want to play a fun and exciting game that has its own niche in the gaming world and doesn't follow andy conventional methods.			"

												NecroVisioN is a action first-person shooter, released in 2009, that takes gamers across the frantic battlegrounds of World War I and into a dark underworld of vampires, demons and dark magic.And seriously, ignore the other reviews on steam, I have not crashed once, but do take note, it's an old game, so you need to run it in compatibility mode as windows xp. And please try to avoid comparing old games to new games in terms of graphics.The gameplay was tons of fun. Not only do you get to butcher mankind, you get to butcher the undead and supernatural. A similar game would be Serious Sam. You are able to use the environment to kill enemies, find secret places filled with loots and notes from soldiers.There's only 1 issue I found, the targeting system is actually too realistic, so yes, sometimes shooting at the same shot with a rifle causes a little accuracy differ, that's world war 1 for you hehe.Do ask questions if you want more information, I prefer to keep reviews simple and without any spoilers, no ranting, no whining and only facts from my experience, it's not too gore by the way, so if you enjoy a fun time killing enemies and experience the mayhem of world war 1, do try it out.If you like my review, do check out https://cassus.org/muut/ for reviews from gamers like me!

There's a playable demo so go on and try it for youself, if you liked the demo, the full version goes better and better.			"

												Fast-paced and fun the whole way through. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a unique shooter with a great setting. There are so few games that take place during WWI so it was refreshing to see a shooter choose that time period over WWII. The dual weapon system was different from anything I had seen in other shooters and it added another great layer of gameplay.			"

												Quick Summary: Action / Horror First Person Shooter with mostly World War 1 weapons, though that changes about half way through the game. The graphics are decent for an indie game and gameplay is pretty basic shooting with partially regenerating health so you can run through large portions of the game.You play Simon, an American soldier in Europe fighting the Germans in World War 1, but you quickly encounter far more dangerous enemies as the dead rise and demonic forces appear out of thin air. As you sacrifice your humanity and progress deeper and deeper underground, you find the ancient world of the vampires, who look like people in heavy bug armor (watch out for their vampire kung fu). For ages the vampires have held back the demons from invading, and now it’s up to Simon to do what they no longer can: Enter the portal to Hell and defeat the demon lords.Right from the start of the game you’ll get some pretty pathetic World War 1 guns and throwable weapons. Most of the enemies in the game have enough life that it takes a few seconds of shooting to kill them. That means any more than 3 or 4 enemies at once can be a threat to you, especially when you run into the big dudes who actually run faster than you and take about 5 clips of ammo to kill. Like a lot of modern games, if you can avoid taking damage for a few seconds, your life will partially regenerate (up to about 60%). This means you can run past about half the enemies in the game (much harder in later levels with teleporting enemies). An additional tool in your bag of tricks is the “adrenaline” meter which you charge up by killing enemies. The adrenaline can be used to temporarily slow down time, making it easier to avoid enemy attacks (or run away like me). If you take enough damage to kill you, and you have a full adrenaline meter, the time slow will activate automatically and you’ll actually become invincible during the effect. Unfortunately, during the time slow, your attacking and reloading is slowed down too, so don’t think you can just use the opportunity to blast everyone. Additionally, when you’ve started your descent underground you’ll acquire a special weapon with magical attacks (shadowhand). It’s not as cool as it sounds, but it adds to your arsenal.Pros:+I enjoy horror shooters (like Jericho) and despite having mixed ratings, the story is ok.+This is a straightforward run and gun. There isn’t that much puzzle solving so if you just want to blast some enemies, you can do that. You have a little compass on your HUD that points you which direction you need to go.Cons:-The game crashes occasionally for no apparent reason. Also, I wasn’t able to Alt+Tab out of the game without the game freezing. There’s a bug causing blurry vision, but that can be fixed with a command line addition.-The little cut scenes between levels are weird. Not only is the subtitling occasionally wrong, but they show and say things that don’t make much sense relative to what has happened in the gameplay. This is likely due to the game’s developers not being native English speakers.Overall, the game is a mostly brainless shooter and if you’ve played the Serious Sam or Painkiller games, you should have an idea what to expect. The game isn’t awesome, but it’s not completely horrible either. 6/10  "

												One of the only Doom-like in the vein of Serious Sam and Painkiller. It's more focused on the story, which is far from being enough polished, but the gameplay is solid and violent with many weapons, melee and some dark magic. The atmosphere is set in an apocalyptic WWI invaded by the undead and demons. Slow to start, but really, really good in the end once the whole arsenal is unlocked. I only wish that the enemy waves were more diverse like in Serious Sam.			"

												This game is so bad in a way that fits just right and manages to be brilliant in its stead. You catch glimpses of what would be the horrors of WW1 between the over-the-top, ridiculous violence you're dishing out and the ham-tastic one-liners the protagonist touts all the way to Hell. Despite all of this weirdness, the game genuinely plays well, handles nicely, looks swell without pushing softer rigs, and is just a bunch of fun if you're willing to overlook a loose bug here and there. If you can find the humor in running a bayonet through Germans that all look suspiciously like Hitler while your character drawls ""My guns never tire!"" in a Texan accent, you'll probably get a kick out of Necrovision.

												Great game , I recommend everyone to play it.NecroVisioN is set in 1916 during World War I. The player takes the role of Simon Bukner, a young American soldier recently recruited into the British Army. In addition to German soldiers, Simon soon finds himself fighting supernatural forces, including vampires, demons, and zombies found in locations varying from the battlefields of World War I to secret laboratories and underground caverns. The main setting is the battle of the Somme, during which a rumor of a mysterious infection has appeared, which causes all people to turn into zombie-like state. Later, the game takes the player into two new settings; the underground realm of Vampires, and the demonic realm, Hell.			"

												Personally, this took me back to the good ole days of serious sam and Painkiller,   the whole POINT is to have a F*#KING weird story that makes little to no sense because its JUST about gibbing and slicing and shooting your way through the baddies. if u want (ugh like most people do nowadays) exo-suits and miniguns......go play CoD because this is not that. this is a game for people who want to PLAY, not scream at the screen every 5 seconds because you got sniped.  sure it mightnot hold up to BF, CoD, or anything like that, but thats cause its not supposed to......bottom line if ur a cod fanboy who gets bent because you cant 360 noscope......then dont play this.   IF however you are a person who enjoys blowing away germans with a 1911/luger combo or using (some badass) demonic weapons and gibbing EVERYTHING that moves, give this game a whirl.			"

												This game is objectively bad, but so crazy it doesn't stop it from beign fun as hell. You shoot things, you stab things, mostly stab, sometimes kick on ground and then stab. Since combined kills charge adrenaline and regenerate health, melee is actually superior to shooting things from behind cover. Because of that combat is messy, really messy.And after fighting a Giant Robot Scorpion piloted by a Necromancer (seriously), you unlock magic, from fireballs to raising dead. There's a Challenge Room avaliable from main menu, that allows you unlock additional spells. Also levels are suprisingly big for a linear shoter, with not only secrets, but in one case, entire hidden section with optional boss.After you beat the game, there's NG+, where you can replay story with all already obtained unlocks.One thing that annoys hella out of me is that when dual wielding weapons, mouse buttons get reversed. Also writing and voice acting are awful. It's like ones in story and gameplay were been made by different people, with story beign dead serious, while gameplay keeps throwing cocky one-liners like it's Duke Nukem.			"

												Necrovision is a flawed but awesome game. It features nonsense story set in World War 1, the occult, and a lot of shooting things in the face, punctuated by atmosphere destroying laugh-out-loud one liners that the clueless but enthusiastic protagonist spews out diarrhetically through the whole game. If you miss the ""don't give a ♥♥♥♥"" attitude of old pc shooters, you'll love NecroVision. It doesn't take itself seriously, there are tons of secret areas that are actually difficult to get to, you can kick a ghoul and shotgun it in the face while its still in mid-air. Then the protagonist will drop some godawful one liner that will crack you up. It's great.Corpses have collision though. Why. Just why. Who thought that was a good idea?			"

												Beginning of story is rough. It seems to skip a bit in order to reach a cool cinematic. But by and large, you have to read between the lines a bit to fully understand the (at times) disjointed dialogue and narration. Aside from questionable writing and story connection, we have the gameplay. Controls are rough, clunky and sometimes counter intuitive. The shooting is haphazard and rushed, enemies taking 3 .45cal rounds in the  gut just to stop shooting is ridiculous. The even more ridiculous part is that enemies also take 3 bursts from a mounted machine gun to drop. So the muntions do the same amount of damage between a pistol and a mounted weapon??I could go on describing things I found in my short playtime, but it was on sale and that's pretty much the only positive part. I can say I got a game for a dollar. Probably won't play it much unless I really feel the need to finish the story.			"

												A mediocre to poor shooter. There are a lot of weapons to choose, but there are not much better to say. The graphics are not bad but are very obscure in dull sense. The mechanics are too simple, based on combos of 2 buttons. Gameplay involves shoot and shoot against same enemies on lineal maps with boring backgrounds and insivisible walls, pushing levers to open the more o less hidden doors: that is all. The dark disturbs to aim even at middle distance; there are hideouts with items to expand combos and collectible posts little interesting. The story is typical, but the script is lousy, the characters phrases are more horribles than the plot and the cinamatics are disgusting by number and content. Only for nostalgics of this failed path of old school shootters, and young people attracted by discounts, but there are much better options, and older, for same or lower price.			"

												Finished this title last night, am very pleased with it, and had to resist a strong urge to start another run-through. I ran the steam version under Win7-64bit at 1920x1200 with good framerates, no control issues, not a single crash and only a few scripting bugs, easily fixed by loading the last autosave or quicksave. NV has an excellent savegame system, with frequent autosaves, as well as regular saves & quicksaves.This is an 'old-school' shooter, like quake2 etc, but with a crucial twist. I recall little of Painkiller (same makers, same engine) gameplay now, but think it did reward multi-kills. Multi-kills and the combo system (namely, *how* you perform kills, such as a kick followed quickly by a shotgun blast, or two pistol shots to the head, or a shovel toss, or a bayonet stab followed by a shot: there are a few dozen possibilities) are the core of the game. Once you 'get' this mechanic, and it takes a bit of learning, taking on a crowd of shambling nazi zombies or cart-wheeling			"

												Painkiller engine used to great effect. Looks fantastic, runs great, and introduces a wealth of new weapons, enemies, and locations, as well as gameplay tweaks.The combo system is really unique and helps balance out rushes of enemies. The combat in the early levels is less of a mob, and more manageable. The PainKiller engine surprisingly feels natural like this, and combat is engaging and brutal.Great game for a reasonable price. This has the ""fun factor"" that is missing from Hard Reset.			"

												I would call this the original Nazi zombies, but they aren't Nazis.  This game takes place in WWI, or ""the forgotten world war"" in an alternate setting where the common psychological effects of trench sickness and shellshock come to bite you in that they become real.  Demons, Wizards, Zombies, Orcs, and shotguns all become your best friends and worst nightmares as you walk nearly hand in hand with them through this psychological thriller.  Also, you can play football with an englishman.  What's not to like?			"

												A game that didnt get my hype and i dont think ive ever heard of the devolopers before, tried the demo and was intrested enough to get the game. What surprised me was the length of the single player. At the end you kill the big bad boss and his Gaint spider and you think, YAY i won :D *slaps* NO your not even half way done. Great game with lots of weapons and some fun baddies to shoot at. Main char has some funny lines and its an intresting take on a game, i played this right after i beat Wolfienstien and this ranks far above it in my mind.			"

												I have not had this much horror filled death fearing fun with a FPS in awhile. Graphics are top notch with undead appearing very ghoulish along with other unique creatures such as what looks like a cross between a flying manta ray and a fiery pheonix.  Gore as mentioned already is excellent and on the spot brutal to the eyes. When seeing a world war 1 soldier blown to bits with only his torso intact it really made me feel like i was seeing a real corpse. The whole game world of NECROVISION is very immersive making one feel you are there in the trenches. They could have easily made this into a world war 1 game if they had wanted to. Soldiers screaming,dying,yelling out orders all around the player really takes one to another world. Its this scary before the supernatural stuff even begins! There are hand written notes scattered about which are voiced whenever the player picks them up to read. The voice acting is of high quality with the creepiness i used to feel when reading the books and letters in CLIVE BARKER'S UNDYING game. They really help to flesh out the nightmare of NECROVISION even more then it terrifyingly is. The player characters voice in the original demo was a bit..hokey but in the full retail version his voice is great fitting in with everything going on around him. There are also times he will talk with what sounds like a demonic version of Caleb from the 1990s 3dgore shooter BLOOD by MONOLITH after alot of carnage and going into a murderous rage. Music is grand and epic with some very powerful fitting classical atmosphere. Alot of the environments are destructable with different ways of making them into shattered wreckage. There was this one tower i could either wittle away from afar with a mounted machine gun placement or move in close and blow it up with a grenade. One of the sleeper hits of the year and a must buy for fans of the genre.			"

												NecroVision features a great idea, decent graphics and a horrible execution. The game is about a fictional World War I where you play a birtish soldier in the trenches of the western front. The germans start using necromancy and other forbidden things, resulting in the death of a lot of your comrades. Despite that, you start fighting your way through the enemy lines and deeper into the killing fields. With a variety of weapons supporting you, you are fighting zombies in different shapes, resulting in a generic, repetetive and some times boring combat. The only thing changing is the overall enviroment, meaning you will sometimes be in trenches, sometimes in tunnels, sometimes in buildings [..] What makes me not recommend the game? Well, for one its the just now mentioned, not very good executed combat, and on the other side it's the bad story writing. It just doesn't feel like the Developers thought everything through, despite the idea beeing such a great one. Another killer (heh) for me was the really over the top buffed bosses. Bullet Sponges are not real until you tried fighting those. Hint: The game does not seem to allow screenshots. But maybe that was a problem on my side. Do not buy this from germany, as you will get a low violence version, resulting in even more unsatisfying combat.			"

												Necrovision is a bit of a surprise. Outwardly it doesn't take a lot of risks with the setting in WWI with a demon apocalypse. The protagonist can be a little irratating, as the developers decided to make him an American and apparently all American's talk like Elvis. However, the gameplay is brisk and the level design polished enough that you will find yourself forgiving these tired cliches in favor of some good 'ole fashioned zombie blasting fun. Necrovision is not a great game per say, but it has heart and definitely stands as a solid entry into the FPS genre. If you are looking for a quality shooter, you can do better, but you could certainly do much, much worse than Necrovision.			"

												A better Wolfenstein than Wolfenstein. That's including the new one. A little rough around the edges, but it plays incredibly well, and though the graphics are the tiniest bit dated, it still looks very nice. I'm only a few levels in, but there's already a great variety of weapons and if the trailers/screenshots are anything to go by there's quite a few more.Gameplay-wise, it straddles the line between older shooters (Duke 3D, Shadow Warrior) and the earlier Call of Duty games. Movement is slow and aiming is kinda janky- protip, don't aim down the sights unless you really have to- but the melee combos and the fairly quick weapon switching make combat really fun.The term 'hidden gem' is a bit of a cliche, but it definitely applies here.

												Ok, i've read some good reviews as much as i have read the bad reviews for this game. To start off NecroVision is a FPS set in the time period of world war 1. The guns in this game range from pistols to machineguns that also range in power and precision. NecroVision uses the war to give the game a sense of action and then boosts that by adding in all the bosses and demons that you have to fight while completeing a mision. The game also uses the common mental toying all through the game. For example, you can walk into little dugouts where the soldiers slept and most of them are gassed so you go through stages where it becomes hard to see through the gas but when you complete whatever it is that you had to do you would find there was nothing in there. So that's the good perks of the game but unfortunately not every game is perfect. The game will sometimes shoot grey lines across the screen if you don't have the required computer stats or if you overestimate your computer and set your settings too high. Well that's basically all the perks to the game so if you are looking for a great action game that still has those horror game qualities then NecroVision is a game that you should consider.			"

												Not a horrible game by any stretch, but it does have it's down moments.  It's got an interesting combination of war with Nazis and vampire battles, but each half of the game is pretty much day and night.  There's a good selection of weapons, but once you hit the second half of the game anything you find in the first half are useless because the ammo is never found again.  Vampire weapons aren't bad, but underpowered against th hordes.  The story doesn't make any sense and seems to jump around.  Finally, the final boss is one of those bosses where they have a ton of HP but present no real challenge.  It's also lengthy, but drags on way too much near the end, like they ran out of ideas and decided to just clone Painkiller.  Overall, it's a decent weekend killer.			"

												Necrovision não é nenhuma maravilha mas tá longe de ser um fps ruim. Tem gráficos interessantes e imersivos em diversos momentos e músicas boas mas que depois de um tempo começam a ficar repetitivas, por isso não brilham tanto. A proposta do jogo é enfocar mais no combate do que na história, por isso as vzes tem umas coisas sem pé nem cabeça, assim como  zumbis e soldados que desmembramos a todo momento na engine de física divertida. O arsenal de armas vai desde tipos de pistolinhas, metralhadoras, snipers, baioneta, shotgun, até um canhão lá antigo e armas melle como espadas e pás também. É gostoso decapitar cabeças e desmembrar corpos dos zumbis e soldados  com essas armas todas. A história se passa na Guerra Mundial e o que começa numa guerra comum passa a desvendar uma maldição de mortos se reanimando. Zumbis variados, alguns que rastejam, e os soldados alemães vivos também continuam na brincadeira, e mais adiante começam a aparecer até ogros gigantes e demônios alados e também seres que mais aparecem alienígenas. Aparece até um dragão! Mas e sse ajuda a gente. A gente ""pilota"" o dragão. O jogo é uma loucura do começo ao fim por isso não dá pra levar tão a sério, e sim viajar com ele, surfar na idéia louca do desenvolvedor. O foco do jogo não é ter a história redondinha, e sim maluquinha. Num esquema de jogo que lembra Serious Sam e Painkiller. Bem jogável o jogo e recomendo bastante. Fechei o jogo no modo demonscrusher. O jogo tem artefatos pra achar pra aprimorar alguns combos.			"

												The idea is cool, the implementation isn't that great.I am spending most of the combat just running up and stabbing enemy soldiers because someone decided that any form of gun play should be punished by never ending enemy spawns.One of the boss fights they decided was a great idea to put you in a confined area with a boss that 2 shots you, wrecks structures, and runs faster than you, etc.  I lucked out and got stuck in some debris.The lame one liners from the hero are awful, I get the idea of the character type they were going for...but its just not needed for this game.I'll give them props for having every letter narrated though, and the world war stuff looks pretty cool.Its not an entirely awful game, just lacked polishing.

												The game itself is pretty good if you're a fan of Clive Barker's Jericho or Wolfenstein and similar occult / Nazi-themed games... Though this game suffers from an overly-chatty protagonist (he often spouts off one liners after every kill...) it is still an interesting universe they've crafted. Unfortuntely the game crashes quite often, hindering your progress. Still, it's a fun game and blasting zombie nazis in slo mo with buckets of gore is quite satisfying..

												The good: It's grim and i love the whole crazy ♥♥♥ barbed wire monsters. The combat is great in some places and the Shadowclawthing is fun.The bad: Everything else. Here's how cutscenes SHOULD work: You get to a point in a level and see them. In this game, it's AFTER the level and tells you stuff that happened during. Example: I killed a boss, then spent a few more minutes running around. After the level ended, it showed me a conversation w/ the boss.Also, this game isn't friendly on the hardest setting. At the end of the game, there are almost no checkpoints. Also, why is it that every creature in this game is neat but for hell they choose a stupid demon thing that is bland? Get this, though, it's the most annoying enemy in the game. It doesn't die, it sounds bland, and is too small to hit 60% of the time.This game, for me, was tolerably fun UNTIL the last 2 levels. I had to pace myself thru the terrible checkpoints and boring, unending monsters.C+, but then D- later.			"

Though this game suffers from an overly-chatty protagonist (he often spouts off one liners after every kill...) it is still an interesting universe they've crafted. Unfortuntely the game crashes quite often, hindering your progress. Still, it's a fun game and blasting zombie nazis in slo mo with buckets of gore is quite satisfying.. If you're a fan of either Clive Barker's Jericho or the aforementioned Wolfenstein (or by extension Doom, to some degree..) I think you'll find enjoyment in this gory, somewhat simple shooter.			"

												The idea is cool, the implementation isn't that great.I am spending most of the combat just running up and stabbing enemy soldiers because someone decided that any form of gun play should be punished by never ending enemy spawns.One of the boss fights they decided was a great idea to put you in a confined area with a boss that 2 shots you, wrecks structures, and runs faster than you, etc.  I lucked out and got stuck in some debris.The lame one liners from the hero are awful, I get the idea of the character type they were going for...but its just not needed for this game.I'll give them props for having every letter narrated though, and the world war stuff looks pretty cool.Its not an entirely awful game, just lacked polishing. Just be wary when purchasing, 5 bucks or around there is a solid price for what it offers.			"

												This is a strange game, mostly because of story and gameplay mechanic.There is a lot of funny things, but it's still boring. If this game did not leave in paranormal fiction, it would be an ordinary game with unusual setting (there is few WWI games, most of them - bad or average), but strange plot twists and almost broken game mechanic spoils all. And also the game is too large and long, but level design strange and frequently bad.If you wanna buy this game, do it with big discount. But i think, that you cannot done it to the end. Each time, then i was thinking, that's the end, the game continues, appeared vampires, zombies and many over non-wwi things.			"

												I wish there was a third alternative to voting up or down.This game is a shooter in the vein of Painkiller (which I love). But it's painfully amateurishly executed. There is gameplay there and effort put into it, but I for one don't have patience for the voice acting, balance issues and cutscenes.There are a few redeeming factors that makes me want to recommend the game though. Like the WW1 setting, relativly pretty graphics and shooting mechanics.But overall it bores the hell out of me. I'm sorry game, but I'll have to thumb down.			"

												a very strange game, like a split personality. There are two completely different parts: the initial one set in WWI with twists like zombies, mechs and demons and the second one which is like doom, shadow warrior set in a completely different environment.I preferred the first part (WWI) much more than second. It had nicer level design and variety in enemies and weapons. The second part was quite boring and the level and enemy design was very repeatitive. For 2016 I can not reccomend this game. Graphics look old (ok there have been 7 years since the original release), the game is heavy and there are a few (but rare) crashes.All in all, an interesting idea, but a mediocre game. There are better options out there for both the WWI part (well perhaps not so many) and the doom-like one.If you look for a demon-based fps, I would strongly reccomend the remake of Shadow Warrior.

												Dark, ugly, buggy and quite frankly, not worth your time. The idea behind it is nice though, but the game itself is a ham-fisted cluster♥♥♥♥ with graphical issues which ruin the experience. Black screens on loading game with no way to fix it anyone?Sad to see a good idea ruined by incompetence.Update 07.09.2014. I decided togive this game a try again, remembering it had some good moments. But alas, it was not to be. A recent reinstall brought a new issue. First, the game crashed in the menus. When I got over that, the video was so blurred out so that I could really not see anything. Once I managed to fix that, the crashes started. It started crashing to desktop after 2-3 minutes after starting up the game, even if you just waited in the menus and no amount of workarounds on the intertnet or tinkering around in .ini files fixed this. This game is now completely broken beyond any salvation.OS: Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit, GeForce GTX760.Verdict: Save your money and buy something that actually can be played. Even if you receive this as a gift, either politely decline, or add toinventory instead of adding it into your library so you can gift this to someone you really, really don't like.			"

												While at first i was not impressed by the aiming system, the below average graphics, and the glitchyness that comes with the game, I soon changed my mind on it.  At first, the game seems like a below par WWI game.  It takes that aspect, and brings zombies and many other monsters together.  Once you get to the powers, its honestly very fun.  The bosses are challenging and sometimes takes planning.  This game reminds me of a mixture of call of duty zombies, skyrim, and bioshock all together.  I would totally recomend this game to others, despite its low score on metascore.			"

												Short Version: This game...just no.Long Version: NecroVision is a game that seems to be driven by great ideas in the war torn trenches of Europe circa WWI. That sounds rather interesting until you start playing the game and find yourself groaning at missing textures, bad hit boxes, unterpowered weapons, laughable enemies, and your big texan main characters voice. I will at this time say that yes I do know it is an indie game but many of the problems of the problems listed above are something they should have looked at the third time around in beta and fixed. My play time of 3 hours was about all I could stand so I can't comment on the magic satan powers you have/get and will never find out.

												While the idea behind this game is a good one, the game itself is not. There is a lot wrong with this game, from bad and at sometimes obnoxious graphics, terrible sound design, godawful (however pretty funny) voice acting, and general A.I idiocy. However I'd say a lot of this could be overlooked if the core game was fun. However this is not the case. The gunplay isn't very good, and the whole thing feels slugish. Not the mention just the overall feeling that the game could done with some more bug testing. I know I didn't play it for that long so you might want to take my review with a grain of salt; however I knew from just the little that I played that I would not have had a good time completing this game.

												One of the best underrated games i've played, This game is filled with quick action shooting. from the World War 1 Trenches in No Man's Land to the Burning Pits of Hell, and hearing your character yell DEATH AND DEATH AND DEATH while shooting the demons of hell, you know that the real demon is yourself and your not simple surviving, your slaghatering. don't take me wrong. this is not an easy game. I played through it on the hardest difficulty without knowing there was a slow-mo button you could sometimes use, I didn't discover this button until the second necrovison game. I got stuck in many places and had to redo them many times. anyway, the theme is really a horror like theme. the WW1 theme got trences, mountains and castles with it's grey-ish environment at night. and when you look up at the sky with the stars and the moon at night and hear the music you really fell alive lol x'D ..I want to write more, but it seems like steam won't allow me a longer review. anyway, lots of weapons!

												The graphics were really bad, something you really can look over but it made just about everything shiny like the people, guns, and environments were made of plastic.The voice acting isn't great, it sounds like it was making fun of itself. You can almost hear the voice actors rolling their eyes as they read their lines.The gunplay is floaty, beyond all belief. The guns just feel really bad. Once you're done clicking at the enemy they just rag-doll in an awkward manner. Don't even get me started on the hand-to-hand combat.They were apparently too lazy to properly make cutscenes in this game. In the flash-forward sequence they just played the trailer. Your character is supposed to be imagining something and all it is are poorly made scenes where they try and fail to edit it in a way where you don't see UI elements popping up. In a cutscene!There is one cutscene that sums this game up, in the beginning. Soldier comes running at you, soldier gets killed by incredibly badass looking enemy, you awkwardly run up to the enemy, you do this awkward punch like thing, one punch later the incredibly badass enemy turns into a rag-doll, your plastic face looks into the camera.They obviously tried to emulate Painkiller by making both you and the enemies move incredibly fast, which would have helped normally with the gunplay, except you are constantly packed into tight corridors where you are consistently bumping into things, trying to pick out the gray-brown enemies from the gray-brown environment. That or a really boring turret section where your character says the lamest one-liners that try to be edgy.Seriously, just stay away.			"

												I would recommend it if it maybe ended at the scorpion tank.-Game was relatively fun against the zombies and germans but it got extremely tedious and boring later on-The protagonist's dialogue is god awful, has to be the worst I've ever had to listen to.-enemy hoardes (namely the underworld zombies and demons) are just stupidly tanky, it's just boring having to stand there mowing down hoards that take way too many bullets and are just constantly spawning almost, they aren't difficult just boring to fight and too tanky.-shooting isn't that great-game started in Italian-Game was in slow motion for the 2nd half of the game whereas graphics etc were fine (might just be my computer)-when you just want a game to hurry up and end it's not a good sign-final boss is just stupidly slow, feels like your doing no damage the whole time, it's not that hard, just takes way too long.-Little to no guidance regarding some mission objects or how to proceed-ran into some gamebreaking glitches, at one point it looked like the graphics card exploded and if i walked into the twilight zone I couldn't see anything and the world was spinning, another glitch was I literally couldn't progress because the enemies didn't spawn to open the door for me.+ragdoll zombies flying away with the shotgun was pretty fun.In conclusion: would have been bearable if it ended somewhere near the underworld, it was just all downhill boring and tedious from there.

												Necrovision - a game that fears Nazis you get to kill, what could be better ?I'll admit, there are some good moments in the game - the trenches, while somewhat limited, felt confined but that is a good thing, as it tries to capture the hopelessness of trench warfare, and how awful it must've been for the soldiers huddled in the trenches.I felt once you get the shadowhand things became more interesting, fighting in the underworld and in vast caverns wasn't too bad at all.So where did this game fall ?- limited number of guns.  - limited number of enemies, other than different uniformed, you were more or less fighting hordes or nazis or demons in the underground.- while the shadowhand is a cool weapon, it eventually gets old, and the explosions make it hard to play as it fills up the whole screen.- I felt the game was wayyyy longer than it had to be- use of the dragon was cool, but didn't really add anything to the story or game overall (what happened to the dragon afterwards ?)Can't recommend the game, it felt like a standard fps with nothing to distinguish it from the rest of the pack.

For this review I wanted to see how many games are dedicated to WWI. What I found  is they are not many and not too popular. Valiant Hearts and Verdun are most well known I think. There are few grand strategies, but i'm not in to them. The reason i started with this is NecroVision take place in WWI setting and this was the only thing I could think of to start the review.You take the role of Simon Buckner, young american who join the British army to fight germans in 1916. After an ambush and the following fierce battle, everything for our hero turns upside down. Simon encounters supernatural phenomenon and realize that greater evil threatens to wipe humanity. To a certain degree it's the germans fault. They never learn not to play with fire. The story is not bad, it kept me interested through the whole game, but it's not memorable enough. You have to save Earth from germans, vampires, demons and whole other bunch of creatures. The good thig in the story is it takes to great locations.Let me take a step back and look at the the settings. Rebindable keys, HUD and crosshair opacity are few of the good things in here. But in sound is missing speech slider. In some places people speak so quietly, I can bearly hear them. Subtitles help to understand what are they saying, but they in some places are not displayed. In video options you can change a lot of things – textures for weapons, people, envoirment. Also you have render quality, dynamic shadows and so on. But even if everything is on max settings the games is not a good looker.The dev try and succeed in putting enough mechanics in the gameplay to differentiate from other FPSs. Not all are entirly original. When you kill enemy in non-traditional style, you are rewarded with Adrenaline and Fury. Adrenaline is basically bullet-time and later is used for one more thing. Later for it. Non-traditional ways for killing reminds of Bulletstorm, but here they are not that creative. Headshots with different weapons, kicking, melee and so on. When you manage to chain few combos, you gain Fury level, which in turns leads to, for the first few level, electricity coming from you and hitting enemies. For even higher level – incinerating them. For reaching maximum Fury, be on a lookout for hidden vampire artefacts. Each found increases one level. It's so satysfing to melee a group of bad guys and incinerate them.NecroVision is FPS. And what you do in this type of game? Shooting and blasting enemies. How is the shooting? It's good. Weapons have arcade feel to them. They don't have recoil, but they also don't have Quake-like accuracy. If enemies are far away , you have to burst, because crosshair widens and the gun become less acurate. Weapons in 1/3 of the game more or less represent the time period the game takes place. Two pistols, rifle, sniper, rocket launcher, shotgun, heavy and light machine gun. These weapons are used in abovementioned 1/3 of the game. After that the game takes hard turn and starts to get more interesting. You get Shadowhand, SMG, shotgun, rocket launcher, and flamethrower. One of them raises curiosity. It's Shadowhand. It's metal glove with Wolverine-like claws. You can use it for melee or cast spells – fireballs, iron rods and freezing. All are useful. Shadowhand have one one more ability – raising the dead. When Adrenalin is on it's maximum stand to nearby fallen enemie and ressurect him to help you fight.There is more. You can dual-wield pistols and machine guns. You are less accurate, but in close range is so satisfying to mow enemies down. In your right hand you can equip a pistol and in your left you can put another pistol, bayonet, shovel, granade, dynamite and gas lamp for setting enemies on fire. With shovel and bayonet you can melee or throw them. I killed a lot of enemies that way. Almost every murder gives you adrenaline.There is a sprint button. Except for fast movement, you can use it with combination from melee and a gun to knock down a group of enemies. This and kicking are the best course of action if bad guys surround you.I intentionally missed few interesting things, that will happen. I don't want to spoil everything, when the game turns 180.Restoring health is done in two different ways. Generally, half of it is regenerating and for the other half you have to find med packs. This is through the first 1/3 of the game, which I will continue to mention. After that you will restore it by collecting red orbs from dead enemies or finding them in hidden places or breaking the surroundings.When you are about to die, you get The Last Chance. Everything slows down to a crawl for a few seconds and you have manage to get away or die.The level design through the 1/3 of the game are okay. Trenches, castles, dungeons, all standard stuff. But (there is a big but here) when you past that 1/3, the gets more interesting. Better and wider level design, better atmosphere. Gothic dungeons created from forgotten and vanished civilization, full with strange machines, electricity coming from tesla coils, dungeons filled with lava, strange railroad, leading to some uncharted and dark places, deep in the bowls of the earth. Here creativity of the developer shines. Great level desing!In almost every level there are secrets to be found. Except the abovementioned vampire artefacts, there are also weapons, ammo, letters and golden chests to be found.The sound here is not great. As I mentioned in the beginning some voice actors can barely heard and this is design flaw, because this is at certain places. The voice acting is good, but I don't like the main character voice and don't get me started with the one liners. They are not that good or original and you will hear them over and over again through the hole game. Music is almost absent. When is present it's good, but it's so rare to hear it. There is some ambient music and it's contribute for the atmoshpere, but it's not enough. The game needs more tracks and the music have to be played more often. Enemies are fairly diverse. I know i'm repeating my self, but during the first 1/3 of the game most of them will be germans and zombies and few bosses. Eventually and gradually, new enemies will apear. Masked people that shoot you, other that make some kung fu kicks, when you are closer to them, imps, dragons and other flying creatures, two types of ogres and so on. I don't know what type of creatures are all of them, so I make up their species to get you an idea to some degree how they look. I almost had no problems with all enemies, unless they surround me. The ogres gave me headache, because they are fast and do a lot of damage.Almost everything I said until now is what I liked about the game. However, there are few things I don't like and I think it's worth to mention them. Non of them are game breaking. One of them is the AI, when you ressurect someone. It's dumb as brick, always falling behind, you have to walk slowly and babysite them. This makes the ressurection useless. You can also see flickering textures on buildings. As a whole the game is not a good looker. Sometimes I didn't know where to go, I was confused by the level design. Some times I can jump over a fence, others I can't. Not always was clear where to go, but this maybe my fault. There tiny little bugs, but naybe the biggest problem is the first 1/3 of the game. It's fun, but it's just okay. But after that everything gets better – level design, guns, abilities, atmoshpere, enemies, everything! I get it from storytelling point, but some players maybe be turn off by this. Be patient and you will granted with awesome moments. As a whole it's rough around the edges, but entertaing. The game reminds me of Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Painkiller, this is a good thing. It's not as polished as them, but you can always do worse. I had fun, so I recommend it.			"

												There's a germ of a good idea here, but it's not worth the time digging for them. Necrovision wants to be a gritty WWI version of Painkiller. It's unforgiving and filled with demons, blood, and fire. And it just doesn't come together. First, the Painkiller engine doesn't do it any favors. It's got a weird jankiness to it and it REALLY doesn't like stairs. Then you add weird puzzle bosses and arenas that spawn don't give any clue how to progess. You'll just keep shooting things like you always do until you run out of bullets and realize there was a different solution. Or you'll just die because a weird spirit thing that you've never seen before attacked you.It's inconsistant, janky, and confusing. It's not the worst thing for a few bucks, but you're honestly better off just playing Painkiller again, or any of the expansion packs. "

												If Painkiller actually had good enemy design, if the titular painkiller gauntlet wasn't a steaming pile of crap and was actually fun to use, and if it had a so-bad-it's-good story set during WWI, it would be this game.For real though, I'm pretty sure this is even on the Painkiller engine. Enemy design is pretty good. The first few levels are mostly fighting Germans and zombies, but once the demons and vampires start to appear things start to get nicely varied. You get a kickass spellcasting gauntlet about 2/5ths through the game, and you dual-wield it alongside one of your guns, letting you mix up your firepower in a lot of cool ways. The voice acting is a giant ham-fest, it really has that crappy B movie charm to it.			"

												Huh, who would have thunk it...For me, this game stands on its own. It's like Wolfenstein, only WW1. The voice acting is reminds me of classic theatrical. They must have gotten thespians to play the voices.Speaking of voices, the Italian language is default. It was kind of refreshing playing a game with a foreign language that you can only understand through the subtitles. But not all dialogue are subtitled. Soon it got old. Just get rid or rename of put in another folder the italian voice pak in the game's steam library, leaving the english pak alone.UPDATE: Holy...! Didn't see that twist in the story.

												NecroVisioN is one of many old-school games out there. But it's not a generic arcade shooter. There is something that differs NecroVisioN from other shooters, modern included.Story and setting:  The game is set in 1916, during the First World War. You play as Simon Bukner, a british trooper whose destiny is about to change... The game starts in generic trench warfare scenario, but later we will find out that there are much worse enemies than germans. Though, the storytelling is pretty confusing - that's the only flaw.  Overall story score: 4/5Gameplay:Gameplay and mechanics in this game are brilliant. There are two-hand weapon mechanics, enemy limb damage mechanics and even great close combat mechanics. For example, you can grab a knife and a Luger, a demonic hand and a Luger, and much more. Enemies greatly react to damage - you can shoot his leg off to make him crawl away in despair. As in every old-school shooter, there are secrets scattered around the level. Talking about the levels, they are huge, taking an hour to pass, which is definetly an advantage.  Overall gameplay score: 5/5Graphics:The game is built on NecroEngine, which is a modified version of PainEngine used in PainKiller. The engine provides an amazing picture quality: the effects are juicy and loud and the designs are great. Though, graphics in this game are pretty lame in comparison to nowadays standarts - ""soap"" textures and ""rubber"" people. Overall graphics score: 3/5 (personal: 5/5) Design: Design is what gives this game an awesome feeling. Gasmask-wearing spiders; barbed wire-coiled, mutilated germans and vampires, gigantic underground strongholds and much more. Overall design score: 5/5 To conclude, I definetly recommend this game to you if you need quality gameplay. Overall score: 4/5, one of the best old-school games out there.			"

For this review I wanted to see how many games are dedicated to WWI. What I found  is they are not many and not too popular. Valiant Hearts and Verdun are most well known I think. There are few grand strategies, but i'm not in to them. The reason i started with this is NecroVision take place in WWI setting and this was the only thing I could think of to start the review.You take the role of Simon Buckner, young american who join the British army to fight germans in 1916. After an ambush and the following fierce battle, everything for our hero turns upside down. Simon encounters supernatural phenomenon and realize that greater evil threatens to wipe humanity. To a certain degree it's the germans fault. They never learn not to play with fire. The story is not bad, it kept me interested through the whole game, but it's not memorable enough. You have to save Earth from germans, vampires, demons and whole other bunch of creatures. The good thig in the story is it takes to great locations.Let me take a step back and look at the the settings. Rebindable keys, HUD and crosshair opacity are few of the good things in here. But in sound is missing speech slider. In some places people speak so quietly, I can bearly hear them. Subtitles help to understand what are they saying, but they in some places are not displayed. In video options you can change a lot of things – textures for weapons, people, envoirment. Also you have render quality, dynamic shadows and so on. But even if everything is on max settings the games is not a good looker.The dev try and succeed in putting enough mechanics in the gameplay to differentiate from other FPSs. Not all are entirly original. When you kill enemy in non-traditional style, you are rewarded with Adrenaline and Fury. Adrenaline is basically bullet-time and later is used for one more thing. Later for it. Non-traditional ways for killing reminds of Bulletstorm, but here they are not that creative. Headshots with different weapons, kicking, melee and so on. When you manage to chain few combos, you gain Fury level, which in turns leads to, for the first few level, electricity coming from you and hitting enemies. For even higher level – incinerating them. For reaching maximum Fury, be on a lookout for hidden vampire artefacts. Each found increases one level. It's so satysfing to melee a group of bad guys and incinerate them.NecroVision is FPS. And what you do in this type of game? Shooting and blasting enemies. How is the shooting? It's good. Weapons have arcade feel to them. They don't have recoil, but they also don't have Quake-like accuracy. If enemies are far away , you have to burst, because crosshair widens and the gun become less acurate. Weapons in 1/3 of the game more or less represent the time period the game takes place. Two pistols, rifle, sniper, rocket launcher, shotgun, heavy and light machine gun. These weapons are used in abovementioned 1/3 of the game. After that the game takes hard turn and starts to get more interesting. You get Shadowhand, SMG, shotgun, rocket launcher, and flamethrower. One of them raises curiosity. It's Shadowhand. It's metal glove with Wolverine-like claws. You can use it for melee or cast spells – fireballs, iron rods and freezing. All are useful. Shadowhand have one one more ability – raising the dead. When Adrenalin is on it's maximum stand to nearby fallen enemie and ressurect him to help you fight.There is more. You can dual-wield pistols and machine guns. You are less accurate, but in close range is so satisfying to mow enemies down. In your right hand you can equip a pistol and in your left you can put another pistol, bayonet, shovel, granade, dynamite and gas lamp for setting enemies on fire. With shovel and bayonet you can melee or throw them. I killed a lot of enemies that way. Almost every murder gives you adrenaline.There is a sprint button. Except for fast movement, you can use it with combination from melee and a gun to knock down a group of enemies. This and kicking are the best course of action if bad guys surround you.I intentionally missed few interesting things, that will happen. I don't want to spoil everything, when the game turns 180.Restoring health is done in two different ways. Generally, half of it is regenerating and for the other half you have to find med packs. This is through the first 1/3 of the game, which I will continue to mention. After that you will restore it by collecting red orbs from dead enemies or finding them in hidden places or breaking the surroundings.When you are about to die, you get The Last Chance. Everything slows down to a crawl for a few seconds and you have manage to get away or die.The level design through the 1/3 of the game are okay. Trenches, castles, dungeons, all standard stuff. But (there is a big but here) when you past that 1/3, the gets more interesting. Better and wider level design, better atmosphere. Gothic dungeons created from forgotten and vanished civilization, full with strange machines, electricity coming from tesla coils, dungeons filled with lava, strange railroad, leading to some uncharted and dark places, deep in the bowls of the earth. Here creativity of the developer shines. Great level desing!In almost every level there are secrets to be found. Except the abovementioned vampire artefacts, there are also weapons, ammo, letters and golden chests to be found.The sound here is not great. As I mentioned in the beginning some voice actors can barely heard and this is design flaw, because this is at certain places. The voice acting is good, but I don't like the main character voice and don't get me started with the one liners. They are not that good or original and you will hear them over and over again through the hole game. Music is almost absent. When is present it's good, but it's so rare to hear it. There is some ambient music and it's contribute for the atmoshpere, but it's not enough. The game needs more tracks and the music have to be played more often. Enemies are fairly diverse. I know i'm repeating my self, but during the first 1/3 of the game most of them will be germans and zombies and few bosses. Eventually and gradually, new enemies will apear. Masked people that shoot you, other that make some kung fu kicks, when you are closer to them, imps, dragons and other flying creatures, two types of ogres and so on. I don't know what type of creatures are all of them, so I make up their species to get you an idea to some degree how they look. I almost had no problems with all enemies, unless they surround me. The ogres gave me headache, because they are fast and do a lot of damage.Almost everything I said until now is what I liked about the game. However, there are few things I don't like and I think it's worth to mention them. Non of them are game breaking. One of them is the AI, when you ressurect someone. It's dumb as brick, always falling behind, you have to walk slowly and babysite them. This makes the ressurection useless. You can also see flickering textures on buildings. As a whole the game is not a good looker. Sometimes I didn't know where to go, I was confused by the level design. Some times I can jump over a fence, others I can't. Not always was clear where to go, but this maybe my fault. There tiny little bugs, but naybe the biggest problem is the first 1/3 of the game. It's fun, but it's just okay. But after that everything gets better – level design, guns, abilities, atmoshpere, enemies, everything! I get it from storytelling point, but some players maybe be turn off by this. Be patient and you will granted with awesome moments. As a whole it's rough around the edges, but entertaing. The game reminds me of Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Painkiller, this is a good thing. It's not as polished as them, but you can always do worse. I had fun, so I recommend it.			"

												Defiantly a fun game, too bad it no longer has multiplayer servers... or was it multiplayer support? Either way, story's rather fun. Well, story and voice acting aside, the combat and feel of the game is quite above par. ... speaking of which I really should go try to at least finish the campaign...			"

												for $1.25 it's ok'ishthe main problem is overlap between the standard weapons, the challenge room unlock weapons, and the new game+ unlock weapons; you probably won't bother with a new game+ because your new toys keep disappearing.it also has some graphics and getting stuck in walls/objects issues but that is offset by the ability to save anywhere as often as you like.in short this is a buggy bargin bin title that might be worth a once through as long as you keep your expectations low and you buy it cheap.

												This is one of those times I wish I could give a neutral rating. It’s definitely not one of the greatest FPS games, but it certainly isn’t the worst. You play as Simon Bukner, an American Soldier in The British Army, fighting against the Germans during World War I. The game takes you through the battle of the Somme, underground world of vampires, and eventually Hell. During the course of the game Simon uncovers a war between vampires and demons,  and earth’s fate hangs in the balance.  The plot itself is interesting but does fall flat in some areas, and has weak narrative. Although it does have weak narrative, you generally feel progression as you play through game, and it often feels like you are working towards a goal. Unfortunately more often than not, you aren’t quite sure what that overall goal is, or why you’re doing it. The dialog and voice acting is subpar and is sometimes laughable due to it’s corniness. A side not on voice acting, for the last few chapters of the game, all of the voice acting was in Spanish or Italian (excuse my ignorance) but the cutscenes were in English; it was never explained why, or at least I didn’t see why. Funny thing is, is that I didn’t mind at all, I felt the language fit really well and the voice acting was nice.   I did really enjoy the combat in Necrovision,  it had a very old school feel to it, and a great dual-wield system The weapon selection was adequate, although during the latter half of the game, just a small handful of guns was available, and you could no longer get ammo for the weapons you had found on earth. The enemies you fought were varied, you come across German soldiers, zombies, ghosts, vampires, and demons. And all kinds of hideous abominations of said enemies. Boss fights were fun and were generally large bosses, but took little strategy.   I wanted this game to have a “neutral” rating was because it isn’t a game I would ever go out of my way to recommend to a friend, and there are a lot of other shooters I would recommend before this one. But it’s positive because I did have some fun mowing down some zombies and demons and spouting some cheezy one-liners			"

												I just wanted to give this game a thumbs up! It is cool as hell!! Be warned, weapon switching is awkward.Now get this game away from me, I'm so glad I beat it! Wow did it drag near the end, it was a testament to finish it. This was classic doom-like fps. Truly a very much darker than comedic game in spite of the cheesy one-liners our protagonist tends to emit. It is not abrasively difficult, but the struggle and accomplishment is so gratifying due to the sheer amount of enemies and the   really long tense levels of a horror game. It is a test of patience, and degree. It brings up a psychological question about PTSD, in fact.Not for everyone. Darkest game I ever played, mainly because of the vast emptiness of its environments. There are trenches and warzones that are very detailed and cool looking, play this game longer and realize that there is nothing cool about the later levels even though artistically adequate, they are there to represent Hell as a much worse place to be.Necrovision begins out on a WW1 battlefied and leads into the depths of hell, STEP by bloody STEP!

												A very fun FPS. The weapons are all fun to use. Enemies are very reactive. The things you get as you progress in the game are badass. The secrets/lore are fun/interesting. There is a lot of variety and exploration in this game. There are also challenge missions that you unlock as you beat the game that allow you to start a level with certain items always which is cool. You also unlock various necromancer abilities as you go.Buy it, it's worth it for the gameplay alone.Also you can knock enemies the ♥♥♥♥ over with melee attacks.Just like in Dark Messiah, boot to the head.

												Holy. freaking. crap. I loved this. loved it loved it. the action is fantastically real feeling, the period settings, (don't let the video fool you, the first 5 hours or so are in ww1 trenches against germans with the occasional supernatural weird thing to give it a halucinatory vibe.) the plot is pretty good and the acting quite good, the ... mysterious way they imply a whole bunch beyond the given plot is fantastic, kept me curious. one of my favorite shooters ever now. GET IT :D			"
