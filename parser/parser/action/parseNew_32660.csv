												The Delta Force Series games are wonderfully done and well laid out. With each game there are a bunch of missions to complete and things to blow up. The graphics in these games are old school. The shooting in the games can get frustrating at times because you might get headshot from a AI that you can't see. Just take each level slow and steady and for the most part you can kill enemies really far away since there is no bullet drop. The missions can also get frustrating since if you fail something in the mission you might be put right back at the beginning of the level and might rage quit because it was hard to get to a certain point. Just remember quick save and save alot while playing to avoid frustration. The online portion of these games are still alive, but you might have to go looking in some of these Delta Force games. Ive really enjoyed playing these classics from beginning to end and I know you will too if you are a army buff and enjoy a good old fashion First Person Shooter.			"

												Not played DFX for years, just bought it for nostalgia only, myself I enjoy some mindless shooting for 1\2 to an hour of fun. Lets face it Novalogic had its day with DF, DF2, DFLW ect great games in there day then with a new engine brought out BHD (Blackhawk Down) full servers great cumminity ect, then it was followed with Joint ops + esc drivable vehicles and helicopters even 100 people servers now that was great, then things turned for Novalogic downwards a game called Angel Falls never seen the light of day.Now less of the past both DFX games are sad cash ins, now thats my opinion for failing company. pro's1) can still be fun with friends on mp (Nostalgia sake)2) graphics ok nothing stunning but playable lol3) make your own maps4) still can find sites that have mods,maps and other interesting stuff5) Can replay singleplayer missions for better score. con's1) AI♥♥♥♥♥♥ bad and mental lol2) odd mad bugs like AI shooting through walls, nothing that breaks game though3)  Only worth it if your a fan of Delta Force games and its cheap.4) Singleplayer is short few good missions, but repetitive at times.

												I have such a love hate relationship with this game, on one hand it will kick your♥♥♥♥♥the first time you wander into it without planning your attack and on the other hand the more finesse you put into your performance the better you get at it, this is what you would call an actual game. weird i know, these are the kind of games my dad would have and they introduced me to the idea of gaming itself, so while many people may prefer the original delta force or black hawk down this was always the one i could get into and was the most accessible to me. it probably looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥to most people and i won't lie it kinda does to me too, but if you can get past the graphics you can find a pretty decent and simple fps. my main point here is to let you know i'm looking at this game through nostalgia so take my view with a grain of salt. but to me this has the perfect balance between modern games and the old stuff you always see people talking about like commodore amiga/atari st/nes.

												The classic FPS game that is multiplayer.  strategy is required in most Multiplayer maps.  they are not simply a RNG map. "

TL;DR: If you're looking for a game that's similar to the older Delta Force games, look elsewhere. This game had almost everything that made Delta Force what it was stripped out of it.I grew up with the Delta Force games, more specifically Delta Force 2 and Delta Force: Land Warrior. I played those games very often, and I liked the semi-realistic fighting involved. You had to choose your loadout and your playstyle. Did you go with a silenced small weapon and sneak into the objective, or did you grab a sniper rifle and pick off targets before moving in? Combined with this and the fact that you only could take a few shots before you died (no checkpoints here), Delta Force was a beast of its own, and it took a completely different approach than the Quake-like FPSs so prevalent in those days. Delta Force: Xtreme, however, took this formula and turned it on its head.Here are some of my grievances:To start out with, you are limited to only choosing your primary and secondary weapons, and you have a very limited selection. Do you want to be a sniper? Here, have a selection of ONE sniper rifle. The extensive customization of your loadout is completely absent from Xtreme.Drivable vehicles are in the game now, which seems like a nice idea. However, the controls are extremely floaty, making the vehicles very difficult to control.The entire experience does not feel realistic at all. You can take multiple shots before dying, and you can pick up ammo packs and health in buildings. If you die, you respawn where you started with your mission progress saved, making you trek all the way back to your objective. This is especially egregious when you die and you're meant to use a vehicle to get to your objective. The game doesn't respawn a vehicle for you to drive, making you go in on foot. I wouldn't mind the respawn mechanic if it was actually complete.This is a small thing, but it still irks me. In older Delta Force games, I had a habit of keeping the objectives list open, as it was small and it neatly fit into the corner. The objective list in Xtreme is needlessly gigantic, and leaving it open obstructs your vision.The price for a title of this quality is extremely high. I would expect to pay a maximum of $10 for this, especially considering how old it is. It is twice that price. There are more recent, higher quality games for the same price.To conclude, this game should only be bought if you really want to own all of the Delta Force games, and only if it is heavily discounted. Look elsewhere for your military FPS needs.			"

												The design team believes that they knew what is Delta Force. But this game proves that they didn't know.			"

												Well its more or less of a reboot to the original Delta Force but theres something I noticed thats missing. For starters, theres no further options like the previous, such as allowing teams on or off, and the difficulty settings. Those what makes Delta Force a great game, this game is decent. Its a good run though, but too easy for me especially when you dont have the option to turn off respawn which is always on. This is something a child can beat.			"
