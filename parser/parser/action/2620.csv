												Call of Duty is very different from modern Call of Duty games. It doesn't have regenerating health, it has a different game engine, combat flows differently, and you are a regular soldier, not a super soldier or super agent.The campaign follows three nations battle against the Third Reich and their constantly growing military. You play as Americans, British and Russian soldiers in different battles against different groups of the massive Nazi Army. As the American solider, you are fighting in France in a desperate battle to claim land and villages from the Nazi's, as the British, you go from standard soldier to SAS agent, and charge on Stalingrad as a Russian soldier starting as a lowly conscript and end as a senior soldier. In the campaign, you never feel invincible, and unlike modern Call of Duty games, you will almost always have a large amount of soldiers with you, rather than going alone or with a single invincible commanding officer. This doesn't make the game easier however, the lack of regenerating health means that it is unwise to carelessly move, especially on higher difficulties where having low health and no health kits for another mile can make the games campaign brutally difficult.The soundtrack is a high-point for the game as well, with memorable themes. The voice acting is far from modern Call of Duty's Hollywood voice acting, but then again, it can stand with it as an equal because nearly all the Call of Duty games have bad voice acting (minus Kevin Spacey, he was the best part of Advanced Warfare of course!). The sound effects hold up to players because they were re-used for several more games, and as they stand, they aren't exactly low-quality.Visually, the game has aged since release, with odd faces, bad animations and low-resolution environment textures. The gun models are noticeably lower detail compared to Call of Duty 2's models as well. Despite this, the visuals only get in the way if you decide to only focus on them. The engine is clearly quite old, but the game runs well on modern computers for most of the time. The only real annoyance is the lack of support for most resolutions, meaning that .cfg configurations are needed to run in resolutions such as 1920x1080.Despite its problems, Call of Duty still stands as one of the best in the series, the game may be visually aged, it may lack the narrative focus of later games, but it stands taller because it focuses more on spectacular battles and large set pieces instead of plot and the excessive use of QTE's. I ultimately recommend this game to anyone who loves Call of Duty to see how the series should be done, and lovers of the genre as Call of Duty, and its expansion pack, United Offensive make the best the series. A stellar game, and a brilliant starting point for a series that has unfortunately lost its way.			"

												9/10 - The first game I ever received with my first ever gaming PC back on Christmas 2003 along with Castle Wolfenstein, 14 year old me couldn't  have been happier.  To put things into perspective I played Wolfenstein for maybe 20 hours while putting hundreds into this.  Most people weren't there for the beginning of Call of Duty's legacy but I sure was.   Wasn't surprised about the juggernaut the series turned into.  This is where it all began and if you want the perfect experience be sure to grab the expansion United Offensive it added sprinting, cooking grenades and new weapons.  It turned Call of Duty into a 10/10 in my eyes.			"

												Call of Duty is a first-person shooter from Activision, the first game of its franchise.Call of Duty set in the second world war, D-Day on and after the invasion of Normandy. In Call of Duty, you can play as three nations with America being the first, you play as Private Martin of the US Airborne Division dropping behind enemy lines before D-Day is happening. Then as the British you also play as the British Airborne assaulting the Pegasus Bridge while as the Russian you take part in the harsh Battle of Stalingrad and beyond with the Red Army. You will use many world war II weapons like M1 Garand, MP-40, Bren, Thompson and many more.Call of Duty graphics may be old, but it still good, the characters acting are good. For an old game it runs smooth and without issues on newer operating system.Call of Duty is a good game, a good start for Call of Duty series since this is the first of the series. Good old game, I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

												Call of Duty is a first person shooter set in World War 2. We start off as a simple American rookie in boot camp where we are thought the basics of crawling, shooting and reloading. Before you know it you are sent right to the heat of battle and left to fend for yourself as your allies are too busy trying to survive to help the recruit. It was a pretty cool intro that immediately reminds you that you are just a simple soldier not John Rambo. There is no regenerating health but instead you must rely on health kits to restore your health. It forces you to play much more smartly and knowing when to duck and hide while letting your allies take the fatal wounds in your stead.  You are very rarely alone and will have allies watching your back throughout most of the battles. Unfortunately your allies can prove to be just as fatal to your as the enemies. They will occasionally block your path while you are under fire and have a habit of looking into your barrel while you are trying to line up a shot. You are not allowed to shoot them since the gun won't fire when you aim at them but they somehow find ways to get killed by your bullets. They are not completely awful and will frequently save your life but they can be quite a burden at times. Later on you will also play through the eyes of a British and Russian solider which have completely different feel and take place simultaneously to the American war efforts.Each nation has their own unique set of weapons but the Germans use different guns so you will run out of ammo and have to rely on scavenged German weapons in all three campaigns. The British campaign is the weak point of the three as you will usually be “infiltrating” some place but it always ends up with you killing tons upon tons of enemies by yourself or with a few allies which feels very out of place from the chaos of the other two campaigns. Chaos is where the Russian campaign exceeds. It is very brutal and you better pay attention to what people are saying and duck when you hear them say so or you will without a doubt die. Your comrades won't even equip you with a gun, just a round of ammo and tell you to run up a hill where the Russians are being slaughtered by the dozens. Gods help you if you stop running to collect a gun and some more ammo, they will assume that you are a coward  that froze up and gun you down killing all sense of comradery between you and the people at your back.Gun play is top notch and is very fluid. All the guns feel unique and sound very powerful. It is truly a pleasure to the ears to hear the battle around you and  everything comes together to be very immersive. The Germans have far superior aim than your allies and it can be annoying how accurate they are with anything in their hands including mounted machine guns. Your allies are pretty capable when they are rushing toward the enemy but as soon as they are stationary they suddenly have the aim of a drunk Stormtrooper. You are equally as accurate as the enemy with most guns and are capable of leaning sideways without moving which is very useful. Up to two weapons of your choice can be carried along with your pistol and grenades. It does present a problem when there are tanks in the area and you are forced to carry one since your allies are always extremely reliant on you even if the anti-tank launcher is right next to them.Graphics are obviously dated and it does not support modern resolutions out of the box. You will have to tweak the config files a bit for HD. It is surprisingly pretty tame on violence. There is no gore and the only blood is a small burst when shot that quickly evaporates. Music is great, sound effects are incredible and voice acting is pretty good too minus the Russians. Multiplayer is only played by a few dozen people and it's alright. Nothing special but it is pretty fun though expect a challenge from the veterans that still play this game. You will not be on foot throughout all of the campaign, you control a tank for a brief mission and will have to occasionally shoot out of a moving vehicle. The latter can be a bit frustrating since you do not regain health and have no way to avoid damage other than shooting them before they fire a shot at you. This is still a great title that holds up well to this day. The only feature that would be odd to modern FPS gamers is the health kits required to survive but other than that you should be able to fit right in. All the things that make a game like graphics, sound effects and gameplay work very well with each other in this title and it makes it a immersive and brutal experience throughout. This is definitely not the Call of Duty to get if you want to play multiplayer though. Outside of the campaign there is nothing else to do and there is no incentive to replay it again so it is the type of game were you play through it once and delete it. It is one hell of a ride though and  highly recommended to those seeking a single player World War 2 experience.			"

												In 1998, came out a game known as Half Life. It revolutionized the FPS genre by providing a narrative element. Along with that came the linear level design, since you cannot have proper storytelling without one. No more would the player just run around in the maze-like level design, picking off enemies, collecting keys and finding the exit to the next level. Love it or hate it, but what we know today as FPS is all thanks to Half Life.After Half Life, many games have come out with mechanics very similar to Half Life. Medal of Honor and Call of Duty were one of them.It's important to note that Medal of Honor franchise was started up by Steven Spielberg himself - it has its roots in N64's Goldeneye. To be exact, Steven was inspired to make the game after he saw his son playing Goldeneye. Early Medal of Honor's would come out only on PS1, and would look very similar to Goldeneye. That said, in 2002 they would release Medal of Honor Allied Assault - made from ground up for pc. The most iconic moment of that game was the omaha beach level - copied straight out of the Saving Private Ryan movie. Unlike the older FPS games, it was very atmospheric, and that's all thanks to the narrative element. That said, the rest of the game lacks the atmosphere of the omaha beach level, mainly because throughout the whole game your character fights alone.What does this have to do with Call of Duty? Well, it so happened that during the development of Medal of Honor Allied Assault, a group of people left the development team and formed Infinite Ward. They got a contract with Activision and made Call of Duty, which would come out in 2003. It is said that the reason that group left is because EA wouldn't let them make a soviet campaign.Anyway, both games have a very similar feel, but there is one big difference. In call of duty - ""no man fights alone"". That's the line that was used to advertise the game, but it's 100% true.There are 3 campaigns: American, British and Soviet. Just like Medal of Honor Allied Assault, many levels replicate existing movies. Like for example, American campaign is very similar to Band of Brothers, while the early levels of the Soviet campaign are from the movie Enemy at the Gates (which is a terrible movie with a few good scenes here and there).The british campaign is the only one that doesn't follow the ""no man fights alone"" motto. Mainly because it's about a group of SAS operatives, doing various things behind the enemy lines.I suggest this game to anyone. Actually, this game will make you realize how little evolution in terms of mechanics we had in FPS genre. Here it is as simple as point and shoot. But that's not why i am suggesting it. I am suggesting it because how well it combines narrative and gameplay.As for my statement above, for those who i interested. Personally, i think that shooters are generally very fun. That is why people always keep buying them and that's why there is so little evolution. Regenerative health, grenade toss back, knife button, sprint - i wouldn't really call them big evolution steps, mostly they just automate stuff that you can already do. It's always been about point and shoot and it's still is. That doesn't mean that there is nothing wrong about today's shooters, but just saying that the concept still hasn't changed.ps: this is also one of the first shooters to have iron sights, though there were multiple games in 2003 that had them as well (Delta Force Black Hawk Down, Vietcong 1).

												Call of Duty. This three-word video game title would make most gamers cringe. Recent Call of Duty titles trend towards science-fiction setting and the fanbase are strongly divided in this issue. Gamers (in general) are a bit tired of hearing Call of Duty on gaming newsfeed and want to hear something else. Before Call of Duty was on identity crisis, there was a simpler time back in 2003 when an unknown title dominated many Game of the Year titles and projected first-person shooter genre into new heights. Call of Duty (2003) is a World War II first-person shooter where you play as three soldiers from the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union. Each campaign is based upon historical significance such as the Western Front in late 1944 for the British and American campaign, the Battle for Stalingrad (1942), to intense street battles in the Fall of Berlin (1945). Most first person shooters in the early 2000s were mostly World War II, but Call of Duty was unique at the time because of the sound effects, AI interaction, music composition, and a solid first person shooter. The audio and sound effects are outstanding. Without a doubt. The audio is very loud and is “authentic” with the MG-42 firing continuously, the mortars pounding the ground, or German Stukas dive bombing on your allies’ positions. For the game that came out in 2003, this is very impressive. The enemy AI is competent who would take cover and shoot back, or flank against your position. This presents a good challenge for the player and encourages to conduct some tactical maneuvers, not recklessly charging upfront and spraying bullets like a maniac. The music composition is solid with orchestral music and fantastic soundtrack. Personally, I really enjoy listening to the soundtrack. Ultimately, the game has health packs and medic kits alongside with no health regeneration. This strongly encourage the player to take cover and carefully advance toward the objective while paying attention to one’s health status. One negative criticism for the game is the price. $20 (or regional equivalent) for a game that came out since 2003. There are other game titles that came out way later and the price is cheaper than this. The Steam Sales usually cuts by -50%, nothing more than that. Essentially, this criticism comes directly towards Activision and its greedy policy. I find this bitterly disappointing. As frequently mentioned throughout the review, the game was released in 2003 and playing this game in modern PC architecture would lead to some problems. Few examples are the inability to play in widescreen resolutions (though there is a solution to this), and other technical issues that gamers personally can’t get it to work or function correctly. Call of Duty was a great franchise (emphasis the word, was). Many fans debate among themselves on what Call of Duty game was considered as the “last great game”. The franchise usually leans on historical or modern settings, but the futuristic or science-fiction genre caused many to leave or show grave dissatisfaction. If you want to travel back to a historical time where the franchise actually did very well in the gaming market, then this game (and up to Modern Warfare trilogy or your personal opinion) is for you. In my perspective, the Call of Duty games that took place in World War II was considered as the best and many people who played this setting would agree with that. With raging elementary school children dominating multiplayer in later titles, it is best to say for any sane individual to enjoy the nostalgia and play the single player campaign with ease and peace of mind.

 Nazi Genocide Simulator 2003  But seriously folks, Call of duty before it became the biggest inside joke of the gaming industry, it was a amazing WWII FPS. In call of duty you play 1 of 3 dudes, One Emurican, One Brit, And One Russian (Dota 2 Players Beware) COD ran in Id Tech 3, which at the time, was the go to 3rd party enigne besides Unreal Engine 2, The game looks decent once you get the game to run in 1080p, with AF and AA on, Call of duty was one of the first FPS's to incorperate Iron Sights, not aim down sights, iron sights,   the first game to use iron sights i believe was Vietcong. The gameplay is FUN, the guns are awesome, and feel great., the weapon you will be using the most is the MP40, its powerfull, all troops carry it, and plentifull ammo. Now cod is split into 3 campaigns, i will review each.The AmericansThe worst, its basicly a tutorial, gets you in the ropes, but the only redemming quality is the revisted last mission, were you sabotage V2 rockets.The British2nd best, lots of sabotage, airdroping into the french country side, and plus Captain Price.The Russians (Putin Aproved)The best, INTENSE FIGHTS, difficult, and the ending is amazing (if youve beat you will know what i mean)The MultiplayerIts okay, but you cant change/mod the FOV, so that sucks.Over all Call Of Duty Is What I ""Call"" A FPS Game, i Reccomend Buying It In The Warchest Bundle, Comes With COD:UO And COD 2. I Absolutly Recommend This. 8.8/10			"

												The original Call of Duty.Negatives:It has a few negatives because this game was made back when the studio was still learning their craft.-It’s the only game in the series with a health bar. This isn’t that bad, but on Veteran, there are no health packs, and the AI and situations can be unforgiving (to put it mildly).-The graphics are not the best. Not that this is actually a bad thing, but the character models live in the uncanny valley, and are difficult to look at.-Somewhat repetitive, but this can be overlooked because you’re actually playing though different parts of the second world war.-The tag line was “no one fights alone”, but because the AI was still pretty weak, there are some missions in which you operate almost entirely alone (say 1 out of 3?).-Some areas have respawning enemies, which can make advancement difficult.-The saving system in this game makes it a little difficult to just pick up and play one or two missions.Positives:-You generally have more control over your character than later installments (Black Ops through Ghosts), and are not forced to watch as many cutscenes or set pieces (they do still exist though).-It’s not trying to be dark, gritty, and mature. It’s just trying to be a fun game.-You really do feel like you’re in the middle of pretty epic battles, when they happen.-Harder difficulties are actually hard.Bottom line: I had a lot of fun with the different weapons and scenarios, and can forgive its mistakes because it was the studio’s first project.

												The one and only ""Call of Duty"" game that implemented a health bar for the player. It is not the average ""run and gun"" military fps where the message ""you are hurt, take cover"" is constantly displayed. A true masterpiece of the series that describes the atrocities and the horrors of the war, it is punishing experience that I strongly recommend to give it a try.			"

												The Original and one of the best. It's been just over 10 years since I played this game last. It looks like it is running on Quake III Engine as were many games of its time. Based on WWII, you play as the Allies; US, UK and the Soviets. Use guns of the time, drive tanks, shoot with Panzers, anti tank rifles, even get shot by Soviet Sargents for running like a coward (as they were told at that time to keep on advancing, don't turn back or you will be shot) - even the fact that the soviets were either given a rifle or ammo was there! This is the Call of Duty without auto health regeneration, you have to find those health packs. Towards the end of the game, some footage is shown (although later CODs like Call of Duty: World at War has more footage). I wouldn't expect Multiplayer to exist. I'm giving a thumbs up because I like this game, liked it before too, otherwise the story is pretty short for the value for money.			"

												I might have some nostalgic bias towards this particular installment in the franchise as it was one of the very first PC-games I got my hands on back in 2003. But in comparison to other first-person shooters released around the same time, this title holds up supringly well after all these years.I feel like many of these early 2000's first-person shooters have not aged particulary well, primairly when it comes down to the core gameplay loop, even if there is of course exceptions. And Call of Duty being one of them. Apart from the obvious graphical age, the game does feel very smooth in its general  gunplay and movement. Although the AI is not the best, it does it's job for the most part.The levels are rather varied, as it takes place on both the eastern and western front and so are the scenarios, as they include anything from conventional warfare to special forces operations and even an infiltration. The perhaps obligatory ""turret-sequences"" seems to atleast generally work better then the ones in the newer installements, as there is something more glorious to riding in a ""french tin-can"" through enemy lines then blowing people up from a plane situated far out of reach for the enemy combatant. And while one should perhaps keep the technical limitations of the time at hand, a decent ammount of the levels are literally just corridors with the occasional boxes as cover, which is not too great.There is an at the least decent variety of guns on all sides, all the most well-known equipment for each side essentially. Albeit a lack of heavy machineguns, as all parties make use of the MG42 for unknown reasons and handguns only exist for the americans and germans.As far as the actual campaign goes, it covers the american, brittish and soviet war efforts on different front. The first one being as one might expect, largely being based on an airborne soldier and covers his adventures from D-day and beyond. The second brittish one, seemingly only covers one conventional battle, while the rest consists of more special operations as well as the occasional solo run, which I personally find less entertaining. And last but not least, the Soviet one, while the initial landing at Stalingrad makes for a memorable scene, questions need to be raised regarding it's authenticity, due to some reoccuring unfortunate tendencies when it comes to portraying them alongside the other factions. But after the initial scenes, it too does a a good portrayal of the war and has the most glorious ending.I have not played the multiplayer since probably about 12 years, so I won't go too deep into what it is about, but to my understanding there are still a few servers with a fairly active community up and running.In conclusion, I would very much recommend this title if you can handle the aging graphics, although it may still be a bit expensive for being older then a decade, so one might want to wait for a sale in that case.

												Call of Duty ReviewCall of Duty as a series is probably not respected today as it once was, but I do think it's important to take a look back every so often and see how older games in a series hold up. Especially a series that at one time was revered as much as some of the best military shooters out there today, if not more so. The original Call of Duty is structured a bit differently than your typical modern Call of Duty. Your modern Call of Duty follows a three act structure for a majority of its campaigns and this can tend to make them a bit predictable in terms of story structure. This Call of Duty does have three campaigns, but each one has it’s throughs and valleys, which in turn creates three distinct experiences. Something that the later Call of Duty’s fail to evoke. One could look at it as a three-act structure, but I look at it as a unique structure. A way to tell a story that only a game could. For the most part the campaign is hardly ever mundane or boring, and I don’t really like saying that as some of these missions were actually done. So it feels odd to criticize something that at one point in time had real stakes involved. However I think, that ultimately Infinity Ward’s choice to include these missions gives the original Call of Duty an air of authenticity that is severely lacking in the modern Call of Duty’s. Going through the campaigns 20 or so levels is a breeze. Clocking in at around 8-9 hours plus another 5 or 6 with the United Offensive expansion. It’s a decently long game and definitely worth the money if it’s on sale. Call of Duty may be a bit hard for some newer fans, but if you power through it, you’ll enjoy yourself. I for one was enthralled and taken aback when I saw what these brave men did for our country. It’s not like the game is an exact recreation of war events, but it gives you an idea how it must of been for these people. A very slight idea as I’d imagine it’s nothing like the real thing.  And thus this gives the original Call of Duty a timeless quality. It’s something you can look back to and be able to experience just how bad this world can get. It’s a lesson and warning for all time. It’s poignant in such a way that modern Call of Duty’s can never be. This doesn’t mean that later Call of Duty’s are bad it just means they are missing one thing that makes the original all the better for it.			"

												+ Soviet Campaign has some great moments i don't want to spoil.+ Cinematic gameplay. You get the feeling of being a hero.+ Atmosphere is grim and that is how it is supposed to be. Everything is destroyed and looks apocalyptic.+ Gunplay is good. Crank up the difficulty and you'll play the game as intended: Tactically.+ You need to protect your squadmates. If they die, it will be difficult to reach the next checkpoint.- As the Hero you have to do everything and i mean everything (blow this up, kill that sniper, get me some coffee)- Brittish campaign is the worst. One area is used for two missions (bridge). It is less memorable than the other two.- StG44 available late in game.Other than that the music is good but the campaign is way too short.			"

												Still decent for a game from the early 2000's. I would not play this game on veteran difficulty, it is not fun, unlike in subsequent titles it becomes a quicksave load/grind. It runs fine on Windows 10, but make sure to validate files and restart Steam after the install that fixed any probelms I had. Gameplay wise the best missions are the Russian ones towards the end, and the final 3 levels. In general, the levels are pretty short. There also isn't really a cohesive narrative. The gunplay is decent and at the harder difficulties you need to use the lean ability and rifles much more than the SMGs.Overall, its worth a run through if you've never played it before.			"

												First off, this review is written by someone who did not grow up playing Call of Duty games. I used to watch my friend play Call of Duty games in online multiplayer modes, but I had never been exposed to the Single Player campaign of any Call of Duty until mid-2016 (now) when I finally decided to start looking into this series by playing through each game chronologically. I will be reviewing only the single-player campaign of this game.This is the first game in this long-running series (not a ♥♥♥♥ing reboot. It can be confusing nowadays). Normally, one would expect a unrefined game that is still trying to carve out it's own identity, but that's not the case here. The original Call of Duty is a fantastic game, and I was blown away by just how well paced it was. Story isn't everything in video games, but when one manages to really captivate you in its setting, that's worth praising. Call of Duty isn't about the plot, since the plot is just... Well, World War 2. However, if you are like me and haven't watched war movies or read war novels because you are just too scared of imagining the horror that every single soldier experienced on the battle field... Call of Duty is a nice way of virtually experiencing a 'lite' version of it all. This isn't Spec Ops the Line, it won't make you feel like ♥♥♥♥ throughout its 6 hour campaign. No no, you'll have fun, you'll feel glorious as you mow down filthy Nazis alongside your comrades and brothers, and that feeling of victory at the end is just wonderful, but... There are some moments when the game gives you a tap on your shoulder and whispers ""Just remember, it was actually ♥♥♥♥ing awful"". You'll be caught up in the adrenaline rush as you are playing, but the game leaves you with a nasty aftertaste that'll make you realize how terrible this war must have been, and how lucky you are that you were able to avoid fighting in it!That said, the gameplay is what you'd expect. What you see is what you get, but that's not a bad thing. At this point, you've played a game like Call of Duty in terms of mechanics; it's a military FPS! You walk toward a marker and shoot guys. It isn't awfully difficult, but it's not exactly a cake walk either. You'll die, but it'll be fine, it won't frustrate you. Get back up and try to shoot guys more efficiently this time, eh? Really, that's about it.Graphics are dated, but you won't get sick from looking at them. Sound's great, just put on some headphones and get lost in... World War 2 (yeey).So... In Summary? Call of Duty is worth playing, and it's not just because of its historic value as the first game in this long-running franchise. It's just good, it's a fun and just thought-provoking enough 6 hours of gameplay that you won't regret. And the best part? Once you finish it, you've got an even better game to look forward to - Call of Duty 2! Is it necessary to play this game first? Eh, not really, but it certainly gave the second game more of an impact for me personally. I'd especially recommend it to younger teens so that they can get a first, 'lite' look at what war looked like from first-person before they read, watch and play the really depressing stuff about World War 2.

												I've been playing World War II First Person Shooters since Medal of Honor, and that was fun as heck, especially when EA wasn't such a horrible company as it is today. When someone told me about Call of Duty, which was still a WWII FPS at the time, not the overblown FPS that apparently changed the Game Industry we know today. I played the Original Xbox version of Big Red One, and loved it. Much like other WWII FPSes like Medal of Honor and Battlefield, I love this too!Call of Duty is a first person shooter game that, unlike the recent titles, focuses on shooting and killing things than making it look like some silly interactive movie. The shooting and kill is essentially artilleries, tanks, at some cases, turrets, not where you are stuck with it, it is optional that you use it but recommended if you want to take down large waves of enemies. Artilleries are also opitional but should be used at all cost with tanks, or in some cases, use a bomb given to you to destroy things. In some cases with WWII games, you are in a airplane doing things to destroy buildings that support the enemies, which is satisfying to see the destruction of the buildings.Aside from that, it's a great game, infitnitely better than the recent Call of Duty games in the recent years. Go get it!			"

												In the original Call of Duty, you play as an American, a Soviet, and a British soldier all while facing somewhat challenging missions against enemies.The campaigns are amazing and bring joy to play during them, and at the end you feel a burst of joy followed by sadness that this game is over. You still have big red one, call of duty 2, Call of Duty: United Offensive, and Call of Duty: World at War. Hopefully I get to play all of the listed above besides big red one very soon. This game is amazing, campaign-wise.Not many people use multiplayer, but those who do are saints compared to the modern day call of duty gamers.

												Call of Duty is a really nice WW2-Shooter. No wonder, how a big mark Call of Duty today is.I enjoyed the Singleplayer a lot. This was the first real WW2-Shooter that I played.The Campaign is challenging. If you play with a high difficulty level, you can't ignore the health packs. And this makes the first CoD-Expierence so much lively.The graphics are great for the year 2003 and the used high modified Quake III Engine.The soundtrack of the game is awesome. It feels like an soundtrack for WW2 or regular the 40s.It remembers me a lot on the Indiana Jones Movie Soundtrack.The Multiplayer makes also fun it has some good servers. Not much, but they are good.Not only Pro-Gamer are playing this, I as a regular player can play very well on the servers.The modsupport for this game is also great. I played already some custom singleplayer levels.			"

												This is it, the first call of duty, and it was great then, and its still great now, pretty much. Ok where to start? well I really want to go over single player first. I bought the game for really for single player but you can still find server's sometimes. You start of in US army basic training. and cap. Foly shows your some old propaganda signs that look better then half the graphics in *insert newest call of duty here*. you then run the trainig corse and crawl under live fire. and do not forget what happed to private Bell, he did not keep his head down. then its wepons training. Your first taste of battle is d-day. as private Martin, you land in france and act as a path finder. over all the american missons are great as all the missons, but its the russian missons we talk about the most. There are car chase's and secret missons and mass attacks, and its all more realistic then QTE gubbins and granade spam. For full price it might be worth it but I know it was for me, its up to you to choose. It runs great and I do not think it has ever crashed. I play it on windows 8.1. this game is a masterpiace and all you really need to do is play up to call of duty 4 or world at war, then stop.			"

												I played this game a long time ago, when I was just a kid. I gave it another try now, and I'm not disappointed, its still very good. Of course, the graphics are super old so nothing really nice from this point but the gameplay is still very good and enjoyable.I forgot how hard was the Veteran dificulty in this one (newer COD's are largely easier) and it's very hard indeed.Besides some AI nonsense, some glitch there and there, and some absurdly hard to find objectives the game is still very good.I can only recommend, if you are not into games for the graphics, you will enjoy.The only downside for now is the price. 20€ is really too much, it should be sold around 5 considering its age.That said, you can get the WWII bundle and that makes it a little cheaper (still too much imho), or just wait for a deal and its all good.I wish they would price old games sensibly because it only encourage to get it somewhere else...

												My first COD was World at War. When I saw the first COD on sale, I decided to pick it up and see how well it holds up. To my pleasant surprise, it's quite fun and captivating--in some ways even more fun than the later ones. The graphics are of course dated, but not to the point where you can't get immersed or make out detail. I particularly like the historical setting. There are some poignant moments, though the characters are mostly flat. This one is more about the experience than character drama. "

												Who is this Game For?==================It’s hard to point to any one single aspect of Call of Duty as the reason that it is such an enjoyable game. It’s not a particularly innovative game, but rather does an excellent job of bringing together all of the best facets of World War II shooters and wrapping it all in top-notch level design. Who cares about innovation when you’re having so much fun? Anyone who’s a fan of FPS or the Call of Duty series in general should give the game a try, picking it up when discounted on Steam.Is it good?=================Call of Duty provides a mix of realism and arcade elements that work together nicely to provide a great gameplay experience.  A well-placed shot or two will be able to bring you down, but you can actually take a fair amount of damage and there are health packs scattered about the level or dropped by the dead that can restore you to full strength. If the game's missions could be described in a word, that word would be intense.  Right from the start you'll be in the thick of things, outnumbered and facing withering fire from the enemy.  In just the first few missions you'll have to assault bunkers, take out Wirbelwind Flakpanzers protected by machine gun nests, and face the devastating fire of a Tiger tank's cannon and machine gun.  If you think that's tough, wait until you reach the Russian missions.  In a sequence obviously inspired by Enemy at the Gates, you'll have to cross the Volga River into the heart of the maelstrom in Stalingrad ... and do so without a gun.  Throughout the campaign the game doesn't let up, moving you from one action-packed mission to the next.The game is also mod friendly with a pretty decent following still. There are a few interesting mods that improve just the graphics and sounds including Extreme Mod Light [2013] and CoD Realism Enhancement.Does it have any problems?========================The game requires PunkBuster update to play on protected servers which are no longer hosted on EvenBalance's website. Even still, the multiplayer is actually pretty active for such an old game. Just make sure you get the United Offensive expansion pack since that’s where most of the multiplayer servers need. A big word of warning though, a lot of people have experienced problems running the game on newer hardware, one of the biggest problems when trying to play older games. The biggest problem is a buffer overflow with newer Nvidia hardware and Intel HD cards (http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Call_of_Duty#Buffer_Overrun_error_on_start-up). These issues can be fixed, so if you do have errors, please check the PC Gaming Wiki link for the fix.Final Thoughts!====================It was all too easy to peel away the layers of glitz and gloss and come up with a long list of inconsistencies, flaws and slightly irksome design decisions. Though, combining an authentic look, sound and feel with a simple interface and innovative game play mechanics it’s no wonder that this game spawned a legacy that has lasted till now and this game is still one of the best WWII FPS.

												I'll be honest, I wasn't much of a CoD fan back in the good old days, when it was in its ""prime"" (2000's onwards). I was always more taken towards the Medal of Honor series, because it was original, and the first of its kind. Subsequently some of the development team went their own way, and thus created Call of Duty. I have to say, given the amount of time this has been out, and it's only taken 12 years for me to 'give in' and give CoD a shot, because I've always seen the game-series itself 'tarnished' by it's more modern work, especially all this guff being created with advanced-advanced-advanced warfare. The series itself of CoD, is more robust, proper and rooted properly with their earlier work. Subsequently- this makes the mark, and makes it an honour to play such a game.Alright, into the nitty-gritty. It's a game, alright from 2003.... graphics are going to be limited- bear in mind this was awesome stuff from back in the day, stuff which was top of its peak.Performance wise, on a semi-good/mid-range rig. It works. It's amazing. Everything can be maxxed out without any hinderence. I would assume it can also work on a potato. Not even that, a stone. Dirt. Sand. I dunno.... Donald Trump?It's a great game, runs smoothly, does its job, offers challenging and exciting missions. As well as being historically rigourous when it comes to uniforms and the storyline itself- to an extent. You do get the off bluff of 'destroying hundreds upon hundreds of soldiers in one small area' sort of guff. Other than that. It's amazing. Wonderful. Brilliant. I thouroughly recommend it!			"

												Call of duty is a brilliant single-player experience.It has a kind of band of brothers , tactical feel to it.There is no regenerative health and the gameplay is based on simplistic Tactics like taking cover, suppress , flank  and using grenades.It has a nice selection of ww2 weaponry, and you have 3 weapon slotsInstead of the modern trend of 2 slots.There is no sprinting but you can go crouch and prone.The campaign is split into an American, British and RussianMissions , it is of decent length and varied. Also it is challenging but also very fun to play.The graphics haven't aged that well but it looks solid.I cant understand how call of duty series went from a wonderful game like thisto a load of crap that it is now.

												The game that started it all! A cinematic Wartime FPS that will throw you into the heat of world war 2. One thing I love about this game, is you feel like a soldier. Like you are participating in something bigger than you. Other FPS games throws you into the shoes of the only person who can single handedly save the world. This is more realistic, as all the people you play through the single player campaign is just a cog in a machine.Easily one of the better games in the CoD franchise, and while the graphics have dated somewhat, it's still an amazing game that has aged surprisingly well.

												If you're looking for a nostalgia trip, or you're of the younger generation and looking to see where one of todays largest franchise started, and yes it may not have the best graphics, or the best AI (i could go on about what it doesn't have compared to todays games, but i won't.) but what it does have is so of the best graphics,  AI, moustaches etc from the late 1990's, this was great back then and it is still now, i remember playing this back when i was young, althrough I was too young and too stupid to finish it, i had fun and having played it now just brings it all back. I mean AI may not be smart, but they will punish you even on the easier levels if you're not paying attention, and the non-regening health adds to that. So if  you have a couple dollars to throw around and no other game to play, I recommend you to buy it.			"

If you like Call of Duty WWII games I suggest you buy the Warchest bundle below. The game has decent enough graphics and is relatively old so don't be afraid to max those settings!

I played it alot in my childhood, and enjoyed the gameplay for long time. Speaking of the soundtrack - i really enjoyed it too, sounds well, it's really atmosphering, especially, the ship mission! Multiplayer here is the best too, ♥♥♥♥ off bloody kids who wants ""Player progression and mour awsum tings""!! Also, the game is open for modding, already played alot of Community created content like ""Codoom, Modern Weapons"", even tried to make my own mod, but i was lazy. Of course i can talk about the DIFFICULTY OF MODMAKING! It's bloody easier, better than Half-Life! That's all from me, and the last words - Probably i can say it's the best CoD from IW ever! (Same goes to CoD3, it was the best CoD from Treyarch ever)			"

												Ever wondered how Infinity Ward did before Activision started to milk the franchise with yearly releases? Want to see a day when regenerating health wasn't implemented yet? The original Call of Duty provides that sense with a well done story. While running through World War 2 for the upteenth time, it is a great throwback into what used to be the core of the franchise.Slightly dated, it's not too bad and is a nice refresher after all the ""Bloom is Beautiful"" games we've seen released in the past couple of years.

												Great game back when COD was a respected titleNever played it back then, but even today the game is a great experience. I unfortunately do not enjoy the multiplayer that much, feels very dated. But I still got over 7 hours with campaign, and a little bit multiplayer. But its worth getting this game for the amazing, old school campaign and to experience Call of Duty before it became a joke8/10			"

												Ok, I played all of the COD series (accept 3) and this and united offence could be very much top of my list. It is a very good game, and can still hold its ground against some of the sequels. I think this is one of those games in COD series where ACTIVISION didn't rush to put out but to perfect it. Now look at COD, a sequel every year with changes just to the story line but nothing else, love COD 1 and would recommend to any players to test their skills. OH yeah, did I mention your health does not regenerate, haha, love this game, I played this game back in 2006 and I bought it again, that's why of the low play time.			"

												This game is very awsome.It is not like MW3 or BO2.It actually has a story and not the same dang thing over again.If you had sound up all the way...you would never hear again.Anyway it presents World War 2's liberation of France in a great way.Uses actual battles from the war,though it can get repetitive (by most objectives have you shoot these guys or explode this).It has 3 campains that I will review.American: 9/10 because it never gets harder,British: 10/10 because it is always getting harder and it has great story,and finally, the Russian: 8/10 because it is way to hard.But finally it is very fun and old and new gamers should enjoy it.

												Call of Duty is a classic World War II First Person shooter developed by Infinity Ward after a lot of their ideas for Medal of Honor: Allied Assault were denied by EA's management in 2001. Being developed on the Quake 3 Engine, Call of Duty's focus, unlike most shooters of the late-90s & early-2000s, was on cinematic action with the player being accompained by friendly NPCs giving cover and support fire in the battlefields of World War II from the point of view of a American private, a British special operative and a Russian concript.Pros> The Cinematic Action can be impressive.> The diferent settings and battles presented in the campaign prevent the game from being repetitive.> Tight controls and gunplay.> The Ending, while short, can be tearjerking.Cons> Some unfair and other times downright infuriating level design, specially during the later levels on Hardened and Veteran.> Your AI allies can be very incompetent and sometimes downright annoying.> The lack of temporaly invincibility after recieving damage can lead to some frustraiting deaths where one doesn't have a chance to fight back when caught off-guard.

Most of the people moved on to CS:GO or quitted. Not sure about multiplayer at this moment probably just 1 server left im afraid :(.NONETHELESS I LOVED THIS GAME, if you can give it a try.

												At one time Medal of Honor was the premier World War 2 FPS.  After the first couple of Medal of Honor games, some of the people who made it splintered off to form a company called Infinity Ward.  This is Infinity Wards first game.  It did not take long for this game to become known as the new high mark for single player WW II gameplay.  It's a little dated at this point, but if you can forgive the graphics, it is still a great WW 2 game.  Playing as the Russian who has to wait for the guy ahead of him to die to get a gun is certainly interesting.  You also play as  American soldier, and a British Military officer.  This game spawned a still thriving dynasty.  It's worth checking out.			"

												Below is after 5.5 hours of gameplayThe German part of this game is the most frustrating thing I've played in along time.  It's SO HARD.  I set the game on normal, I'm not sure if it glitched and turned it to insane because man, that enemy AI is so flipping good, everything is BS.  I had to hold this building down that I just killed loads of germans to take back.  So after already killing 40 of them to get this building, I now have to kill another 100 guys plus 6 tanks.  Not at the same time of course but within like 6 minutes.  They just keep coming, to take down the tanks there are 2 anti tank rifles places at crappy places, one of them is right where the enemys are coming up so you are screwed if that ONE guy covering two stair cases die, so you have to fight and kill as many of them as you can so he doesn't die while trying to take out tanks when they show up, and you have to figure out which place the tank spawns to go to which ever rifle meanwhile protecting that guy.  But guess what?  After me saving his ♥♥♥ and there's only a minute left, he throws a ♥♥♥♥ing GRENADE.... right at his feet and he just curls up in a F**CKING ball and BLOWS UP!!!!  After all that, after me working so hard to save him, he just kills himself, and right after that a German comes up the stairs and KILLS ME.  So I restart and do it all over again, I get passed it and 10 of our tanks show up... when we already killed everyone.  WHAT?!  So then we go onto the next mission, it spawns you without much info and you instantly have to kill people, I mean instantly you're in a fire fight.  You then go through buildings getting COMPLETELY screwed over, using most of your ammo, running out of health with the most crazy ai that shoot you so badly and omg they're just so good.  I barely find health and most of teammates die After killing the guys and you're about to get to the next bit, a few more of your new teammates show up replacing the ones that die and then you get to this really stupid bit.  I thought I was done the stupidness but it just got even worse.  I got to this trainyard where there were loads of enemys and artillary fire was hitting us.  And guess what?  My teammates are talking and it's actually OUR guys that our shooting at this location, and they said they don't even know we're here, and they also said even if they did know, they probably would shoot here anyways?  WHAT?So I'm in this place, the Germans are everywhere and owning the crap out of me and then guess what, I run out of ammo on my sniper and my sub machine gun but luckily I killed most of them so it takes all I got to take out that last guy... while I was killing the last guy, I could see 10 green dots around the corner and loads of gun shots, I come around to see what the fus is about and... there's a tank, and only one of my guys left.  LUCKILY there's a rocket right there so I use it to destroy the tank.  YEY, oh wait, there's like 20 Germans in that hanger that are the best flipping guys ever, I swear they were all Rambo.  So I go back and find a sniper on the ground.   I go to the hanger and start trying to hit these shots but man is it hard, they're so good and I manage to kill at least 10 of them.  My teammate runs in there and actually survives and is in there shooting them but I'm still back here trying to kill the remaining guys that are behind all these pillars in there.  I finally stick my head out to see the few last guys and I get shot 5 times in less than a millisecond and DIE.  RESTART from the start of the trainyard.  I quit right away.  I'm going to be back and I will beat this but OMG this game was a lot of fun until Jason Statham showed up.  Once I saw him it was like the game changed to insane.  It was so much fun.  I'll give this game that though, It's a war simulator.  I mean I feel like crap, I feel so stressed and feel so tense.  I do recommend this game, but just play the first few missions and then get out of here because WW2 was kinda fun for like 30 minutes, but once it comes to it, it was horrible.Below is after 30 minutes of gameplayI've only played a bit more than half an hour, already hooked.  The first Call of Duty I played was Black Ops.  That game is awesome, but this game is better.  I'm so sad that I never played this one before.  You know why this is so much better?  NO FUTURE CRAP.  You move as a unit, you feel like you're REALLY there, staying together, moving together.  Just so good!  You know what's also good?  Being able to have to primary weapons PLUS a sidearm.  How all games should be.  Not sure why they took this out of the one later in the series.  STUPID.  This game feels like if they kept going in this direction, they would have WW2 SIMULATOR DOWN.  I mean this is so good that it's 3 am, tired as heck and I was still in 100% wide awake feeling like I'm really there.  I'm sad to say I've played Black Ops 3 and Advanced Warfare... I didn't buy them, played through a friend and WOW are they just bad.  If I wanted to ♥♥♥♥ing jump around like that I'd play Destiny or something, how could they call the newer ones Call of Duty?  More like SH*T Duty.  I mean imagine this game, with 2016 graphics?  WOULDN'T THAT BE THE BEST?  But naw, let's keep going into this future crap, everyone wants that!  NOT.			"

												Decided to play old call of duty games and remenber why i started to love this series, this one, even not having a big campaing, have a variety of diferent missions that feel satisfying when you reach the last one and rush for the next one, United Offensive.Maybe bc this one is based on true war and doesnt have any antagonist, feel much less cliche that when Modern Warfare turn the table (but still, Zack was the only one I actually liked bc his motives were belivable unlike the rest of the series antagonist and the end of world).I would love that the devs reintroduce the waiting reinforcements type of end mission were you had to survive while completing objectives, it had a nice touch that very few games had at the time, and stop concentrating the game around antagonist whishing the end of the world (there are few conflicts who would give a nice story without using real events but believable to the players).This game graphics didnt aged to well, but the gameplay is still strong and a variety of missions complement the game adding   nice characters, some that you actually care for moment, like the iconic Cap Price & Sargt Moody.Its a must for players that like the WWII setting and FPS style of game.

												Wow, this game brings good memories back. As for 2003 year game, it was simply amazing. You play as a soldier in American, British and Russian campaign . Great graphics, solid presentation of historic WWII battles, great gameplay, awesome music. The very first game in the amazing Call of Duty series. I'm glad I've played it. Highly recommended!I have completed the game on all 4 difficulties at least once. Basically, Greenhorn, Regular and Hardened all differ in the amount of damage enemy A.I. is dealing to the player, however, on Veteran, not only enemy A.I. is dealing the same, if not slightly more damage to the player than in Hardened, but there are also no health pickups whatsoever!So the only way to beat this game on Veteran is to abuse quicksave/quickload function, which, thank goodness, is very well implemented.

Despite its shortness it is a hell of a lot of fun, very intense at times.

												You know, I played Call of Duty 2 years ago before even playing the first one just now. And after the 2nd one, I played 4, WaW, Black Ops, Modern Warfare 2, and I think that's it so far. So I was actually a bit surprised at how similar the British SAS missions were to the SAS missions in the later games. I was expecting a plain and simple war game comparable to the slightly superior Call of Duty 2.I will say this though, I wish the Russians weren't pegged as the enemies all the time in the new ones as their campaigns in the WWII games always end up being the best, except for the beach invasion in CoD 2, that might be one of the most memorable missions from the WWII games. That said, this is a classic game; one that should be played by all FPS enthusiasts and especially enthusiasts of WWII games. It was a game changer with multiplayer and the anchor in the Call of Duty series; without the success of the first one, it wouldn't be the franchise it is today.Wonky animations though.9.0/10			"

You get to play from the perspectives of the American, Britain, and Russian forces, each with their own campaigns. I played this after playing Modern Warfare 2, and I gotta say, this game is a LOT better. I only played the single player. I don't care about the mp.

												The first Call of Duty that everyone has praised for, it sure has its hell of a history on battles. Single player really does give off the intense classic feeling, with alongside classic music that keeps the battle looking hard in a classical way.This game is quite difficult on highest difficulty and to those who are modern gamers...... This has health and has no regeneration. So keep your guard up, especially playing on highest difficulty. Fear not, it has quicksaves.Unless you dont want quicksaves, then dont use them.			"

This is the second game in the series that I played (after CoD2) and I enjoyed it very much. This game is old-school, made back in the days where they gave you health and med kits instead of regenerating health. It is one of the first of this kind of FPS games and the start of the CoD series, when the series was actually good. Graphics are old but who cares as long as the game is fun and hell yeah it is!

												ah the game that started it all. cod to infinate warfare. cod (call of duty) is a FPS set in WW2. your goal is to blow things up shoot and kill... it doesnt seem like much but its funner then it sounds. you change charaters every once in a while. their are characters but you only see them once or twice so you dont care much (wic his sad beacuse some die) this game is more of a shoot em up then anything else.7/10pros + 6/7 hours (my time)+ shooting is good+ fun levels + good graphics (at the time)cons- can be difficult (for some users)- no characters you really care about- annoying when you have low health and a quik save heppens when your getting killed			"

												The game's still as fun as it was way back in 2003. A classic shooter that is pretty difficult if you're used to more modern shooters with more movement options and regenerating health. The only problem I have with it is the obvious lack of working video options (I was unable to ever increase the resolution). Game's still fun and definitely worth a $20 price tag.			"

												After picking up the Definitive Collection i will be reviewing all the CoD games in order once i've finished them. Let's start this up with the first one then.So let's just get this over with from the start, the original Call of Duty is a classic and a great game. That said, i think people overrate it waaay above of where it actually stands. First off, the game has a pretty crappy story which is basically just composed of different missions in the second world war. The gunplay is fun, but feels a little weak compared to many other games of the era. Remember that this game came out in 2003 and by that we already could have had fun with the Venom Gun in Return to Castle Wolfenstein for two years.The game includes a total of three different campaigns. One for each of the British, US, and Soviet factions. Funnily enough, you only fight the Nazis in this game regardless. Which makes the campaigns rather similar besides from having different weaponry at your disposal. Remember that this was before they got the series staple regenerating health, so the missions can be vastly different from one another. At one point you are playing a generic CoD sandbag mission and the next you have to kill 100 dudes alone in a bunker, which makes it really odd and unbalanced honestly.Although this might sound like a bit of ranting, i did have fun with the game. Especially once they introduced the Sturmgewehr 44 as a weapon, that gun is pretty awesome and i highly recommend picking it up whenever possible. And while i said the missions can be a mixed bag, they also bring out something the later CoD games are missing. Variety. Which made the game a breeze to play through. The game took me around 6 hours to beat, but it's really all in the player. I found it a tad too easy for my tastes on the regular difficulty, but then again i didn't have to save scum at all.I guess i should give these a score rating since i'll be going through the entire series.On a scale of 44 Nazi helmets being good, and 5 million dead jews being bad. I'll give this game a rating of ""Certified Tiger Tank""It's pretty good fun for what it lasts, but don't buy it for the full price on Steam. 20€ for a game this old is just ludicrous.			"

												Well, as of completing this game, I have now played every single Call of Duty's campaign except for the spinoffs, Ghosts, and Advance Warfare. As I felt with Call of Duty 2, it was kind of a boring FPS that I only really liked because of its World War 2 setting and mainly Russian campaign. Now, it was not a bad game at all, just some missions were more like a chore than anything else, but that is what I expect from a Call of Duty game. I really respect this game for turning into a great franchise for at least a little bit and making the World War 2 FPS more of a thing like Medal of Honor originally did before it. Though I still prefer the earlier Medal of Honor games to the early Call of Duty ones, I think this game was still a solid WW2 FPS and it gets a 7/10 from me.

												The question I set out to answer when I bought this was simple, Is the fond memories I have of playing it just nostalgia, or even today, does it still hold up as the genre-defining FPS game it was 11 years ago?The answer to that question is simple, Its not just all Nostalgia.If you've never played the original, I highly recommend getting it, its a great way of seeing just how far the series has come and see the birth of a lot of things we take for granted. AI-controlled squadmates? That was here baby. ""Ramirez DO EVERYTHING?"" This game pioneered that. The hardest time I had with the game was the fact that there is no sprint key, So you feel like you are running a lot slower than other CoD games, Oh and theres no regenerating health, which means getting shot is punishing. And you will die. A lot. The enemies in this game can still be tough little buggers frequently. But thats also what makes the game rewarding.Flaws? Oh the game has them, Some are simply due to the age of the game, such as enviornments feeling quite linear and the draw distance feeling very low, these are just due to technical limitations of the day. THe bigger flaws to me would be that sometimes inputs are very.. picky.. on when they want to do what you need, and sometimes you seem to get stuck on debris. Also some areas feel very ""narrow"" and you end up hitting a corner. Oh and the squad AI, as innovative as it was back then, is still pretty bloody bad, I've watched them grenade each other or me from time to time. But hey these dont detract from the immense fun and challenge this game provides. And to me the missions in this one ended up being the ones I remembered the most.Get it, You wont regret it			"

												Before Call of Duty became a joke trying to make you feel like a bad*ss with each modern/near future title, Call of Duty was a down to earth title set during World War II where you play as one of three soldiers in the American, British and Russian armies. Developed by Infinity Ward (members that left 2015 Inc. to form their own studio after the development of Medal of Honor Allied Assault) this is their vision of war.This game took heavy inspiration from the developer's previous title (Medal of Honor Allied Assault) and so some elements may seem similar if you played their previous title you'll see some similarities such as standard health and the classic espionage mission that was in a lot of WWII games at the time. However this game contained three shorter campaigns with different soldiers in different armies and it's quite cool fighting in France, Russia, Germany etc. Graphically it won't wow you but there are some really good set pieces with the Russian campaign being the best as it was quite brutal going out into battle without a weapon. Music is nice and gameplay wise it's great. I was playing Black Ops II alongside it and my favourite thing about the earlier Call of Duty titles and FPS games in general was that you could usually go at your own pace. No waiting for characters to talk your ear off for half the game. Maybe a sentence or two then off you go! The game is linear but gives you a long enough leash that it doesn't fully hold you back compared to the more mordern titles. Shooting is fun and responsive, you have some good weapon variety and you feel like a soldier just trying to survive and do his duty... THE CALL OF DUTY! :PAs a WWII shooter it's fun, the only problems I have is that it's a little short and I wasn't able to find a game in the multiplayer. This game at most goes on sale for 50% off so don't expect a great deal. Is it worth playing? Depends if you like WWII shooters and if you don't mind a short but fun campaign. If you do get it I'm sure you'll have a good time with it. I give this game 7.5/10			"

												So I watched Band of Brothers recently for the first time and absolutely loved it. Then I remembered vaguely that this original Call of Duty game had a mission at the beginning where you're part of the 101st Airbourne on D-Day and thought it might be cool to play through that mission and see how similar it was to the movie. It's identical. Infinity Ward didn't even try to shy away from the fact that they borrowed heavily from ""Band of Brothers"" in their very first in a massively successful franchise, Call of Duty. I mean, there are lines in the cutscenes that are directly from the movie. So this Call of Duty is essentially the Band of Brothers video game and the first couple missions let you personally experience those epic moments like fighting through the trenches on D-Day as you work to destroy the artillery guns. Unfortunetly, this game has not aged well. The graphics are likely the first thing you'll notice when you boot this game up. The game requires you to edit the config.ini file just to put in an HD resolution, and even then the textures, models, and animations are severely dated. They were fantastic for their time, don't et me wrong. But they just did not age as well as some of the later games. Explosions are weak, the gun is awkwardly small compared to the screensize, and all of your fellow soldiers will waddle around like their pants are falling off which really pulls you out of the experience. The graphics aren't the only thing that didn't age well though. One of my biggest complaints about this game are the terrible British campaign missions. Instead of giving us more epic largescale World War II battles, Infinity Ward felt it necessary to sprinkle in a whole lengthy and boring campaign of almost solo missions where you infilitrate Nazi supply depots, hydroelectric dams, and battleships and just absolutely obliterate hundreds of nazis by yourself. These missions are typical of shooters back in the day, which is a shame because Call of Duty is revolutionary for its contribution to the idea of having larger open battles with more friendly AI fighting alongside you. Thankfully the game comes back to full strength in the final campaign that features the Russians reclaiming stalingrad and eventually capturing Berlin. The crossing of the river into Stalingrad is as epic as any D-Day mission with tons of soldiers storming the beach and plenty of gunfire, artillery, and planes flying overhead. It really was surprising to see a mission of this scale put into a game this old.    Another major problem with this game is the outdated health system. It's a static health bar that will only replenish if you find healthpacks that are scattered throughout the missions. There's at least 3 different types of health packs that give you varying amounts of health. The problem with this system is that even one shot from an enemy submachine gun will drop your health down to half or even lower and the game barely does anything to let you know how close you are to death. Dying becomes so frequent and frustrating that it turns into a game of absolute luck, running from cover to cover and spamming F5 to quicksave the game. The health system wouldn't be as bad if not for the overly difficult enemy AI. I played on the ""Hardened"" difficulty which is not even the hardest setting, and whenever I peaked out to get a view at a Nazi soldier, they instantly are aware that I can see them and stop everything they're doing and start firing directly at me, even if there's allied soldiers standing right next to them. The same is true for enemy tanks and enemy MG42 machine gun nests. If you peak out of a corner to shoot at one of these enemies, you have about half a second before they turn their gun and start perfectly firing at you, and once that happens, your screen will continuously jump upwards preventing you from landing a shot on the enemy. Not to mention enemies generally take more than 1 shot to kill which can be frustrating when you're stuck with mostly bolt-action rifles.    Finally, there's no sprint button. I know this was back in the day when sprinting was not expected in shooter games, but it feels really absent in a war game that requires a lot of cover-to-cover movement. Oh! And friendly allied units can accidentally shoot you in the back and kill you, which happens very frequently. Never in all of the shooter games that I have ever played have I ever found a game where your own friendly units can shoot you in the back and actually kill you. That is an impossibly stupid design choice. So despite the graphical shortcomings, the poorly designed middle campaign, and the outdated gameplay mechanics, Call fo Duty is a classic that features some intense battles from World War II and a great game to help you relive the experiences (albeit very watered down and unrealistic in comparison) that are represented more acturetly in ""Band of Brothers.""

Despite them making it sound really easy to apply, it doesn't work. Extremely dissapointed I paid for games I can't play.

												Love or hate, I will be playing this game because I want to play through the franchise.COD is a somewhat good game with issues.  Sort of like having a bipolar girlfriend.So, I have mixed feelings on this.  On one hand I'd like to recommend the game, but on the other, I wouldn't.I like the WW11 setting.  I get a feel for the atmosphere.  But the gameplay is extremely irritating.  Enemies are bullet sponges.  You can't mow them down with a machine gun or at close range with your primary weapon.  Most times, after 3 or 4 shots, they fall to the ground only to get back up, brush themselves off and continue fighting you.  A couple times I found myself reloading after what I thought was a kill (close range 3 rounds into the enemy) and during my reload animation the a$$ hat got back up and killed me.  WTF???  Anyways, now I know better.  I make sure they're dead before reloading.  I found hit detection to be a problem, as well.  I've shot numerous rounds at enemies that were directly in my sight and found myself having to compensate to make hits.The most annoying part is your team/allies.  They get in your way and can get you killed.  There's nothing like walking through a corridor or staircase with a member of your squad directly following behind you.  As you turn a corner you find yourself in conflict and want to retreat back around the corner.  But you can't because your a$$ hat teammate is humping your leg and won't back off.  *Dead*  So I always let that f****r go first if possible.  When you need a quick escape, you can bet there will be someone, somewhere, that will get in your way.For a war game, first of it's kind or not, I am struck with awe that there is no way to sprint.  I am talking about the original COD here and how it was originally designed.  I served in the Army, and one of the first things they teach you in basic training is the 3-5 second rush.  So, needless to say I was very irritated trying to advance from point to point  without being able to rush for cover.  This may be a minor gripe, but I feel it's important to have something like that in a war game.  I can't understand why it wasn't there.  Oh well, let me walk to this cover point while I get shot up.  Need a health pack?  Let me walk over to the health and hope I don't die in route.  Sometimes you'll grab a health pack only to get shot the f**k up in the second it took you to turn around to take cover.I somewhat like the game, and like I said, only playing it to play through the franchise.  I had high hopes for it since it was given a lot of praise.  But I wouldn't recommend it unless you want to do what I'm doing or are a fan of COD and haven't played it yet.			"

												I would love this game. Despite the age, the atmosphere is briliant, action is frenetic and you are really ""there"" (if you can swallow that arcade style, but come on, its CoD). Missions are well written, ai is... manageable. Overall it would realy be nice game. But the bugs. Sometimes you need to restart whole level several times, because some quest, despite being done, does not finish itslelf. Sometimes it works. But right in the beginning, third or forth mission - Taking a bridge at Caen... I take the bridge, kill the tank and have to clear all Jerries - three are ""nowhere"" to be found. After 10 minute searching I snipe two standing figures ny shooting to their revealed hand. The last one is not in my LoS. Restart level (as actualy killing yourself or your officer does you move only to last check point where the bug ""already is""). I get the bridge, kill the tank, kill all germans and my officer will not end the quest. Restart level, I get the bridge, tank comes, but I cannot go to kill him, becasue the engineer who must go with me, is ""inactive"". Restart level. Get the bridge, kill the tank, kill the germans, officer does not move. Restart level,get the bridge, kill the tank, cannot find 2 jerries... Uninstall the game...Sorry, would be a very, very nice game even after those years.			"

For 20$ I'm sure you could find many games better than any Call Of Duty. Although Its is fun in short sessions, boring in the long term. This game is redundant, and offers the same gameplay mission to mission. This game is not challanging in the slightest, Even on the highest difficulty.

												The Russian campaign begins on a foggy and gray river. You sit hunched down among 20 other comrades in a small, beat-up wooden raft, your only protection from the rain a worn red tarp full of holes flapping in the wind above your head. Your superiors circle around your small pit with machine guns and shout with a megaphone about reclaiming the motherland. German fighter planes strafe the rafts and blow them apart one at a time, until only yours remains. Some of your friends attempt to dive into the water, and your superiors turn around and shoot them. Your boat just manages it to make it to the opposite dock, where wounded Russians are being treated in a makeshift hospital. You line up with the rest of the survivors and pass a checkpoint, where the man in front of you is given a gun, and you are given five bullets. You have no weapon. With that, you begin running forward and almost immediately get knocked down by a mortar shell, and with your head swimming and your ears ringing, you continue up a hill as if in slow motion, where a long row of German machine gun nests lie in wait. You watch flag carriers and unarmed soldiers get mowed down around you, and you know your only option is to continue your suicidal advance. It's a unique set piece that I have not experienced in any other WWII shooter.The rest of the game bored me. It's an important piece of FPS history and is the origin of many systems and styles still in use today. Yet while it remains very playable and occasionally exciting, there's nothing here you haven't done better countless times since.			"

												Let's be honest with ourselves. It's 2017 now. You install this game and start playing, it's simplistic, it looks like crap, it's unrealistic, and it's silly. There's nothing realistic about it. It won't seem innovative to you. It's just a primitive old shooter with the Call of Duty name attached to it. While there may be those for whom this game generates intense nostalgia value, in reality, playing this right now compared to all the wonderful games that have come after it, one asks--why? The campaign isn't particularly compelling. It's pretty much just roleplaying as Band of Brothers. There's certainly better World War II games out there (Red Orchestra, even World at War) so there's really no point to get it, unless you want to see where Call of Duty came from. It's not like the campaign in this game has any bearing on the present iterations of the series. Really, all you need to know is that this was the first Call of Duty game. Beyond that, it has little value for us now.			"

												It's an ok shooter. I found it to be a cross between Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, both of which provided a much better gameplay experience. Fighting as the Russians was the highlight of CoD which provided a hint of originality. Beyond that, there was nothing that jumped out as an experience worth remembering.			"

												The campaign is mediorcre, but the multiplayer is bad. There are NO servers online, I would expect more people because this is, you know, THE FIRST COD GAME. So when I create my own server, I die after aproximately 30 seconds from no one. Simply put, this game is bad.			"

												I've played a lot of FPS games and this game is quite primitive in comparison. I wasn't very interested in the ""milleu"" of the game until I got to play as the Russian soldiers. I felt that the American half was more dedicated to Hollywood action and the Soviet part is more grounded in reality. The game is definitely worth it for that part.			"

What I liked about the game 	I like the idea of having three campaigns, were you can play as three different soldiers from three different countries (America, Britain, and Russia). Each country has its own weapons, and you can also pick up and use the Axis weapons as well (MG42 and MP40).	The combat is fun, intense and satisfying, especially if you are using a rifle; performing head shots.  	Some memorable missions; like operation overload. 	I like the idea behind the cut-scenes were it shows you historical WW2 footage, and I also like the idea that you can read the soldiers diary or their briefing form before the mission. 	A great variety of missions; like for example in one mission you get to drive a T-34 tank and in another mission you are on a truck firing a bazooka. 	Great soundtrack; goes well with the gameplay.	Great arsenal of weapons; they were all actually used during WW2 and each country has its different weapons. What I disliked or was disappointed with 	Don't get me wrong this is a fantastic game, which is well made; there was never a dull moment in it, but it's a lot of money for what it is. If it had included United Offence, then it probably would have been worth it. I managed to complete the game in less than 7 hours. You probably be better of buying this game at a discount. 	Some of the missions are too short. 	Sometimes you can't jump over obstacles; like fences and sandbags. You can't also jump through windows. 	Sometimes it just feels like your doing all the work. 	 I hate having to equip the grenade to throw it; would have been better if you could just press g to throw the grenade. Conclusion A fantastic game, but too expensive for a 2003 game. If you are a fan of WW2 games or FPS, then this game is a must buy, but maybe wait till the game is discounted.   92/100 "

Its bloody fun mate! Playing as a Russina soldier is exiting. Its action packed comrade, dont take a second thought, GET THE GAME COMRADE!!! It had more bad word then hoped and expected, not a huge amount like the new CODs though. The graphics are farely good.(almost as good as infinite warfares) The only bad thing is that there is just campaigne and multiplayer, its rare to find people playing multiplayer mode. but its not that big of a problem, just play campaigne over and over again because it is SO FUN!!!!!!

												Back when FPS had health bars and health packs instead of flashing red screen, personally I prefer our current systems over a healthy bar but I referenced it more to show how old this game was. While a lot of the CoD games staring with 4 and forward aimed at telling stories the original CoD is just WW2 but that is fine. The graphics are what you would expect from a 2003 game, the controls are suitable, and the atmosphere fits perfectly. I feel like it is hard to review the game simply because of how simplistic it is. It isnt expensive so I would more than say it is worth grabbing if you want to play the game that started the massive series that would come from it.			"

You are advancing in each mission, but your AI teammates are drawing attention from youand it was first FPS you weren´t feeling alone on battlefield.Graphics could be old, but atmospheric music and intense action help fit it into the game.But don´t expect long ride ... like all CoD, singleplayer is as short as it could be. Fortunatelly, you will want to play it agian, or even try other difficulties (done every one except the hardest ... no medic bags sounds little harsch).It is worth the try (when it will cost 5 €, price is just insane).

Who gives a **** about graphics?!Pros:+A challenging SP campaign without health regen.+An interesting narrative through 4 campaigns (American, British, Russian, and a fourth that has one level for each of the 3 factions.).Cons:-""Comrades"" in the Russian campaign's first missions are jackasses, the Comissars firing on you if you take even one step back.-Unlike the early Medal of Honor games like Allied Assault, there are no medals to earn.-A bit short on extras.Overall, I give this game a Like-A-Lot rating for how well-structured, challenging, and exciting it is, and for being a true shooter, rather than the Spunkgargleweewee games that are so abundant now.4.5/5			"

												Call of Duty is an interesting subject to discuss. The longevity and multiple entries into the series are a continual cause of debate, argument and even insult. And it all started here in 2003 with the very first entry.I'll keep it relatively brief here since I go into a lot more detail in my episode on Call of Duty for my web series Knee-Deep in the Dead (found HERE).CoD sets you up in three different campaigns, American, Russian and British and was one of the first FPSes to really work towards a larger, battlefield experience. Two levels that showcase this goal the best are the invasion and defense of Sainte-Mère-Église in the American Campaign, and the Battle of Stalingrad in the Russian campaign.The sound design and environments are one of the best stand outs of Call of Duty. The guns are all loud and reflect their real-world counterparts. Some negatives would largely be the very baseline AI, lack of enemy variety and the fact that, even when you have allies around you, enemies more often than not target you.Call of Duty is a fascinating object of study when it comes to evaluation of the evolution of a game series. In playing the first entry, you can see all of the budding elements that would eventually become core ""staples"" of the campaign: scripting, having to wait for sergeant to boot down the door, press ""F"" to do thing, simple AI and stories seemingly assembled solely for the set pieces. Also, a side note is that it seems a /bit/ overpriced on Steam...$20 for a 12-year old game is kind of silly. You'd likely be better off getting the War chest, since it has the expansion pack to CoD and Call of Duty 2. Which has one of my favorite CoD levels ever, the Battle of Pointe du Hoc.Nevertheless, the first Call of Duty is an important entry in the series to play, though it's much easier without nostaliga goggles and truly seeing it for what it was: an immersive, action shooter that helped ensure the FPS genre kept fighting WWII for 6-7 years afterwards.

												What can I say about Call of Duty?. You get to play as the Americans, British and the Russians. Each side has their own campaign to play through, so there's alot of variety to be had. Level design is excellent and memorable, it definately has has replay value.The Sound Quality is top notch when comparing it with other WW2 First Person Shooters games at the time of it's release, it was the best. The same can be said for graphics and models.I believe this was the very first WW2 FPS that you allowed you to bash someone with your weapon. On top of that, you can look down your gun sight to increase your accuracy, and get a better visual on your target; but doing so will make you move slower than normal.If you haven't tried this game out already, give it a go because you won't regret the purchase.

												It's the original, it's fantastic, it started a cultural phenomenon.  This game is an icon.  If you have never played this game, do it.  Now.That being said, how does it hold up today?  Honestly, putting all nostalgia aside...it's ok.  Agh! What???  Just ok????But seriously, it's still kinda buggy, feels a little rough, and the health pack system feels so dated now (even though it certainly makes you play much more careful than today's shooters).  Honestly witht the modern developments in shooters, the health system just takes me out of the immersion of the game and makes me just focus on where I can get a health pack.  Just jarring and a bit annoying.But don't let that deter you.  It's great, it's amazing, and it started a cultural phenomenon.Although, heresy must be spoken.  I still prefer Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and especially the ensuing Spearhead expansion.  Probably just nostalgia since that was my first real PC shooter, but man oh man that game changed me.  You should deinitely check that one out as well.  Both iconic, both wrapped together in history, and both worthy of a good ol nostalgic playthrough.			"

												Was killed by comreds for not advancing.11/10 Would not advance again.So instead being some Medal of Honor clone, this game brought new air to gaming.For the first time I could feel the help of your AI fighters. You are advancing in each mission, but your AI teammates are drawing attention from youand it was first FPS you weren´t feeling alone on battlefield.Graphics could be old, but atmospheric music and intense action help fit it into the game.But don´t expect long ride ... like all CoD, singleplayer is as short as it could be. Fortunatelly, you will want to play it agian, or even try other difficulties (done every one except the hardest ... no medic bags sounds little harsch).It is worth the try (when it will cost 5 €, price is just insane).

												Offers an arguably more difficult campaign thanks to the lack of regenerative health. Many of the missions were quite poor and involved simply going from point A to B with no real stand out moment or climax, several times i had to ask myself ""is that it?"" when the mission ended. Honestly thought the game was underwhelming and it would have left me disappointed only for the final mission (the storming of the reichstag, though nothing compared to its counterpart mission in World at War, was awesome) and the russian lads speech in the final cutscene. Also the ""No cows were harmed in the making of this game"" disclaimer which i found quite witty. Overall it wasn't terrible but still a shadow of the latter releases, granted it was released in 2003 but COD 2 in my opinion offers a vastly more enjoyable campaign.EDIT: I know it's irrelevant from a reviewing standpoint, but Danny O' Dwyer said the mission I mentioned above was the first time he cried while playing a video game.

												Son, this has to be the best CoD game. Either this of CoD2. I'll need to play CoD2 some more and then I'll pass my final judgement. But you may ask ""Why, Birdman? Why is this better than the UBER 1337 H4X0Rness of MW3?"" Well, Johnny Consolefag, it's largely due to a little thing I like to call ""Mr. Grenade."" You see, Johnny, In this game things like the knife and the grenade are selectable weapons, so there's not just an instant grenade and knife button. Which is a good thing in and of itself. But when using the grenade, walking around with it in your hand, you are allowed to use it for melee. That's right, you can beat Nazi's to death with a grenade. Take this explosive projectile fragmenting ball of democracy and 'MERICA!, and slam it into the skull of WWII German Nazi scum to smash the life right out of their body. But, it's pretty BS that Activision or whatever are being such hard-asses for cash, that it's still $20. This is seriously a $5 or $10 game these days.			"

Who gives a **** about graphics?!Pros:+A challenging SP campaign without health regen.+An interesting narrative through 4 campaigns (American, British, Russian, and a fourth that has one level for each of the 3 factions.).Cons:-""Comrades"" in the Russian campaign's first missions are jackasses, the Comissars firing on you if you take even one step back.-Unlike the early Medal of Honor games like Allied Assault, there are no medals to earn.-A bit short on extras.Overall, I give this game a Like-A-Lot rating for how well-structured, challenging, and exciting it is, and for being a true shooter, rather than the Spunkgargleweewee games that are so abundant now.4.5/5			"

												Back when FPS had health bars and health packs instead of flashing red screen, personally I prefer our current systems over a healthy bar but I referenced it more to show how old this game was. While a lot of the CoD games staring with 4 and forward aimed at telling stories the original CoD is just WW2 but that is fine. The graphics are what you would expect from a 2003 game, the controls are suitable, and the atmosphere fits perfectly. I feel like it is hard to review the game simply because of how simplistic it is. It isnt expensive so I would more than say it is worth grabbing if you want to play the game that started the massive series that would come from it.			"

Its bloody fun mate! Playing as a Russina soldier is exiting. Its action packed comrade, dont take a second thought, GET THE GAME COMRADE!!! It had more bad word then hoped and expected, not a huge amount like the new CODs though. The graphics are farely good.(almost as good as infinite warfares) The only bad thing is that there is just campaigne and multiplayer, its rare to find people playing multiplayer mode. but its not that big of a problem, just play campaigne over and over again because it is SO FUN!!!!!!

												The best call of duty ever!! I bought this game during a sale expecting to find a really old game with ancient graphics, and wanted to play it again, just for nostalgia... But instead, I found a still awesome WWII game with incredible scenarios and an excelent campaign. After finishing the game, I was curious about the multiplayer, and I was really surprised when I found an active community and a lot of availabe servers.If you want to play it in HD (1080p), just take a look at the forums, you'll find all the  necessary information to manually configure the resolution.The only thing I didn't like was the price... I think $19,99 for a 13 year old game is exagerated. Even during a sale the game won't cost less than $9.00, which I still find too expensive. Activision should be more reasonable about its pricing policies...			"

												Flawed but it holds up surprisingly wellStory:Kill Nazis pretty much. There are repeated characters and missions where they go over briefings but overall, I couldn’t discern any plot other than kill everyone and follow the objectives. It tries to bring character into the mix by having named characters who sometimes have a line or two but it seems like an afterthought. The story is NOT the reason you play the game.That being said, there is a lot of effort put into establishing atmosphere. As a russian soldier, you feel like fodder. As an American, you feel the ranks progressing and the desperate struggle to stay alive. It’s not rich on narrative but the setting really pulls you in.Gameplay:It’s COD. You shoot other people. But surprisingly, health bar! Which means that you have to look around for packs and you’re on the edge because you die pretty easily. It keeps the game tense especially when you’re in tight hallways where people could come at you from different angles. The shooting itself feels actually pretty good. It holds up well as you take opportunities to pop out of cover to shoot at a guy at a distance or mow down close soldiers. Both sniping and machine gunning feel good and hell, even the tank section controls and plays well.That being said, I never threw a grenade or used my pistol throughout the entire game so it might be kinda unbalanced. One big problem area is the AI. You usually have a few people with you except for a few missions where you’re alone. It’s really strange fighting alone because you’re not freaking Rambo. Even if you start the level with comrades, they can die which can leave you alone at the end of the level. It’s really annoying and I wish there was more group charges (like the end level which was awesome). There are short sequences where you have to wait for reinforcements and I found these to be annoying because you can wait for 2 minutes but for ♥♥♥♥s sake 5 sodding minutes?Graphics/Performance: (with a 970, 4790K, 16GB of RAM, SSD)I wasn’t expecting to say this but the game looks fine. Old? Yes. But fine? Definitely. You know what you’re shooting at and why. The outdoor environments are especially really nice as they tend to open up a bit more.Final Thoughts:This game really shows a team with a good idea making a not perfect game. There are flaws but the core is really good. It’s tense, it shows diversity in its levels, and it tries to be engaging. I’m surprised I really liked it.			"

												I do recomment Call of Duty 1, but with the caveat that the game is a bit overrated. Even for the time it came out, the graphics were nothing special, and the gameplay is linear. The British and American campaigns feel like you're watching (playing?) a B-movie. That said, the Russian campaign so superb that it made me read up on Stalingrad and subscribe to Dan Carlin's Hardcore History. The Russian campaign in particular does a good job of making you feel like you're engaged in a noble cause, a fight much bigger than yourself. It will also remind you that real war is very, very deadly.			"

1- Copy Steam.dll and Steam2.dll to the games folder
2- Change the name of the game to MOHAA, its not MOHAA.EXE or mohaa.exe. Just use MOHAA

Rename
Ex: CoDSP >>>>>>>> MOHAA
or for multiplayer
CoDMP >>>>>>>> MOHAA


After that open the game normaly But from launch by using MOHAA "

												If only Call of Duty stayed this way. It would be nice to have more then 1 compeditive fps other then CS:GO.There is no multiplayer if you live in Australia. Its been long dead, but if your looking for an enthrawling single player campaign don't hesitate to buy. The expansion pack ""United Offensive"" is on par regarding single player campaign.Do yourself a favor and re-live one of the all time classic fps shooters of generations.			"

												Offers an arguably more difficult campaign thanks to the lack of regenerative health. Many of the missions were quite poor and involved simply going from point A to B with no real stand out moment or climax, several times i had to ask myself ""is that it?"" when the mission ended. Honestly thought the game was underwhelming and it would have left me disappointed only for the final mission (the storming of the reichstag, though nothing compared to its counterpart mission in World at War, was awesome) and the russian lads speech in the final cutscene. Also the ""No cows were harmed in the making of this game"" disclaimer which i found quite witty. Overall it wasn't terrible but still a shadow of the latter releases, granted it was released in 2003 but COD 2 in my opinion offers a vastly more enjoyable campaign.EDIT: I know it's irrelevant from a reviewing standpoint, but Danny O' Dwyer said the mission I mentioned above was the first time he cried while playing a video game.

												Was killed by comreds for not advancing.11/10 Would not advance again.So instead being some Medal of Honor clone, this game brought new air to gaming.For the first time I could feel the help of your AI fighters. You are advancing in each mission, but your AI teammates are drawing attention from youand it was first FPS you weren´t feeling alone on battlefield.Graphics could be old, but atmospheric music and intense action help fit it into the game.But don´t expect long ride ... like all CoD, singleplayer is as short as it could be. Fortunatelly, you will want to play it agian, or even try other difficulties (done every one except the hardest ... no medic bags sounds little harsch).It is worth the try (when it will cost 5 €, price is just insane).

												Call of Duty is an interesting subject to discuss. The longevity and multiple entries into the series are a continual cause of debate, argument and even insult. And it all started here in 2003 with the very first entry.I'll keep it relatively brief here since I go into a lot more detail in my episode on Call of Duty for my web series Knee-Deep in the Dead (found HERE).CoD sets you up in three different campaigns, American, Russian and British and was one of the first FPSes to really work towards a larger, battlefield experience. Two levels that showcase this goal the best are the invasion and defense of Sainte-Mère-Église in the American Campaign, and the Battle of Stalingrad in the Russian campaign.The sound design and environments are one of the best stand outs of Call of Duty. The guns are all loud and reflect their real-world counterparts. Some negatives would largely be the very baseline AI, lack of enemy variety and the fact that, even when you have allies around you, enemies more often than not target you.Call of Duty is a fascinating object of study when it comes to evaluation of the evolution of a game series. In playing the first entry, you can see all of the budding elements that would eventually become core ""staples"" of the campaign: scripting, having to wait for sergeant to boot down the door, press ""F"" to do thing, simple AI and stories seemingly assembled solely for the set pieces. Also, a side note is that it seems a /bit/ overpriced on Steam...$20 for a 12-year old game is kind of silly. You'd likely be better off getting the War chest, since it has the expansion pack to CoD and Call of Duty 2. Which has one of my favorite CoD levels ever, the Battle of Pointe du Hoc.Nevertheless, the first Call of Duty is an important entry in the series to play, though it's much easier without nostaliga goggles and truly seeing it for what it was: an immersive, action shooter that helped ensure the FPS genre kept fighting WWII for 6-7 years afterwards.

												Back when FPS had health bars and health packs instead of flashing red screen, personally I prefer our current systems over a healthy bar but I referenced it more to show how old this game was. While a lot of the CoD games staring with 4 and forward aimed at telling stories the original CoD is just WW2 but that is fine. The graphics are what you would expect from a 2003 game, the controls are suitable, and the atmosphere fits perfectly. I feel like it is hard to review the game simply because of how simplistic it is. It isnt expensive so I would more than say it is worth grabbing if you want to play the game that started the massive series that would come from it.			"

												Flawed but it holds up surprisingly wellStory:Kill Nazis pretty much. There are repeated characters and missions where they go over briefings but overall, I couldn’t discern any plot other than kill everyone and follow the objectives. It tries to bring character into the mix by having named characters who sometimes have a line or two but it seems like an afterthought. The story is NOT the reason you play the game.That being said, there is a lot of effort put into establishing atmosphere. As a russian soldier, you feel like fodder. As an American, you feel the ranks progressing and the desperate struggle to stay alive. It’s not rich on narrative but the setting really pulls you in.Gameplay:It’s COD. You shoot other people. But surprisingly, health bar! Which means that you have to look around for packs and you’re on the edge because you die pretty easily. It keeps the game tense especially when you’re in tight hallways where people could come at you from different angles. The shooting itself feels actually pretty good. It holds up well as you take opportunities to pop out of cover to shoot at a guy at a distance or mow down close soldiers. Both sniping and machine gunning feel good and hell, even the tank section controls and plays well.That being said, I never threw a grenade or used my pistol throughout the entire game so it might be kinda unbalanced. One big problem area is the AI. You usually have a few people with you except for a few missions where you’re alone. It’s really strange fighting alone because you’re not freaking Rambo. Even if you start the level with comrades, they can die which can leave you alone at the end of the level. It’s really annoying and I wish there was more group charges (like the end level which was awesome). There are short sequences where you have to wait for reinforcements and I found these to be annoying because you can wait for 2 minutes but for ♥♥♥♥s sake 5 sodding minutes?Graphics/Performance: (with a 970, 4790K, 16GB of RAM, SSD)I wasn’t expecting to say this but the game looks fine. Old? Yes. But fine? Definitely. You know what you’re shooting at and why. The outdoor environments are especially really nice as they tend to open up a bit more.Final Thoughts:This game really shows a team with a good idea making a not perfect game. There are flaws but the core is really good. It’s tense, it shows diversity in its levels, and it tries to be engaging. I’m surprised I really liked it.			"

												Very different than the future CODsWhen i played the SP it was very different than the other CODs i've played and it almost feels like a different game altogether and the story teaches you a lot more about WW2 and the hard times soldiers had to go through.A downside to this game is that there is no ranked multiplayer and you can only play with friends who also have the game but i guess that can be excused for it is a 2003 release.To conclude, if you want to play a good PC game and maybe not have a very powerful computer to run 'newer' games or just want to re-live old memories from playing past CODs this one's definetly for you.

												The game is worth the buy and the playthrough if only to see how far the series has come and how completely off base its become. The mechanics and inclusion of somewhat intelligent AI blows its main competitor at the time (Medal of Honor) out of the water. The environments/maps are also quite massive, but are not as diverse as the MoH titles were. Though the missions were straight forward, the story is pretty weak. Clearly, IW recognized this as the big issue when trying to combine the game aspects of how to fight and what you’re fighting for, and this became perfected later on in the series in later iterations.For some reason, what really stuck out to me about this game (even after playing countless modern FPSs) is how smooth the vehicle combat was.  It was fair for the most part, but you’d get hit randomly and it would raise the stakes enough for you to make your shots count and rely on the game’s minimalist in-car cover system. It felt better than 9 out of the 10 scripted car chases in games these days. I guess they just don’t make them like they used to. I should also note that you can play these games on your monitor’s native resolution. You just have to mess around with the .cfg file under the display height and width settings.			"

												Before Exo Suits, Care packages, explosions every 5 seconds and a blockbuster amount of drama and insanity, there was Call Of Duty and it's idea of World War 2. You honestly can't go wrong with the classic. 10/10 Captain Prices.			"
