												Just like Team Fortress and Counter-Strike, this was once merely a Half-Life mod that Gabe Newell and his co-workers decided to put some extra effort into. It became a high-end standalone title, and brother, did they make a good job. Improved textures, mechanics and overall level design.The game is pretty simple at its core; it's a elimination/free-for-all game where you have to use your surroundings, levels and weapon - the power disc - to claim yourself the big name of the game. Moving fast and swiftly between platforms in a blitz of your enemies is vital for succession in this game. It takes some time to learn, and even longer to master. But by studying your opponents, you'll pick up their tricks soon enough and give them a taste of their own medicine.One thing that I love about this game is the amount of servers that are available, over a decade after the game's release. You'll never have to wait for a server without open slots, allowing you to easily invite your friends to play with you. Trust me, this game is much more fun with your friends. The more players who join, the better and more intense the game becomes.In conclusion, I think this game is extremely underrated and truly deserves a sequel. Lots of Valve fans seem to have forgotten about this gem, and even Valve themselves don't feature it on their official website. But I'm living proof that this game is still taking breaths. Forgotten but not lost, this game deserves your love. It's a part of the CS1 Anthology and the Valve Complete Pack, so chances are that you already have this game and simply forgot that you have it. Otherwise, it's available for the low price of $4.99 here on Steam (50% off as I'm writing).And yes, the graphics might not live up to today's standards. But when games like Minecraft sells millions of copies, I don't see how graphics are an relevant issue.Oh, a final tip to those who'll try this game out: don't fall.9/10 (Would buy this game for a friend.)

Ricochet, one of the best games on steam. Before I go any further I would just like to say there is a tl;dr at the bottom of this reviewSo I'd like to start by saying that I love this game, and its core gameplay is good enough to look past its few flaws. This game is a mod of the original half-life that came out in 2000, however because of its thriving community and plethora of mods, its age has only really now begun to show. It places you in a future alternate universe where the entirety of existence depends on your ability to partake in the activity of “Duel to the Death Space Frisbee” or DDSF for short. Below I've made a table to outline all the various elements of the game with a rating at the end.     Concept Description Rating out of 10   Story The story of Ricochet is a deep and complex one. You are placed in a totally new world, where it only seems as if people are interested in this sport ""Space Frisbee"". You are never told anything about your character, except that they are a Space Frisbee player. That being said though, your character is made to be disposable, and when your character dies, it's over. You are placed in the shoes of a new person, who wears the same clothing as you, and sounds the same as you, and often shares the same fate as you. It's a highly critical commentary on today’s culture, where it seems as if people are losing their lives to something arbitrary, almost a sport, for no real distinguishable reason. It makes the player contemplate what they are doing with their lives, and whether it is meaningful or not. I won't spoil the rest of the story for you, but all I can say is that you should look forward to epic conspiracies, insane bosses, and one of the most exciting and fulfilling endings in all of video games. 10   Gameplay Now, Ricochet is truly one of this games that you can describe as ""easy to learn, difficult to master"". Its gameplay seems simple at first, as it begins with ""throw disc and hit object"" but as you progress you find more ways to play the game using its initial mechanics. First you're introduced with obstacles that your discs bounce off of, allowing you to start having your discs ricochet. The obstacles then change in complexity and usefulness, as near the later parts of the game, you even start to avoid them as they can be very deadly. There are different power-ups for your discs that change the way you use them, which gives a greater feeling of accomplishment when you figure out how to use one of the power-ups to its fullest affect. Ricochet’s gameplay respects player intelligence by giving you many different ways to play. The depth of the mechanics have been compared to dwarf fortress, and although I wouldn't go that far I can certainly see players sinking thousands of hours into this game trying to really figure everything out for themselves. 10   Graphics There isn't too much to say here. For a game that came out 14 (now nearly 15) years ago, it looks quite good. When in came out it was among the best looking games to date, and remained that way until about 2005. Despite looking a bit aged its color and stylistic focus make it easy and pleasant on the eyes, while still allowing for good atmosphere. 8   Multiplayer I'll just start out by say the multiplayer is AMAZING. It captures the cinematic and atmospheric feel of the single player, while allowing player interaction in a diverse open world. You're allowed to find various ""Arenas"" in which you may do battle with your friends to see who's the best at DDSF. With a booming community, and an incredible amount of modded servers you can easily find yourself playing this multiplayer for hours on end. Even though it's been 14 years, because of its very in-depth gameplay and large community, the Ricochet multiplayer is still one of the best you can find on this platform. 10 All in all, I'd give this game a 10/10. Everything about it is amazing and enjoyable, from its single player, multi-player, stunning visuals, in-depth gameplay, and did I mention its kickin' soundtrack? Well it's amazing. Seriously, if you don't have this game, you need to fix that right now.TL;DR In my opinion one of the best games valve has ever made, I highly recommend this game.			"

												An absolute pleasure to play through. Ricochet goes where no other Valve game has ever been before - You take control of Pert Kravelski, another overlooked escapee of the Black Mesa Research Facility introduced in Valve's hit title ""Half-Life"" whose goal throughout the entire game is to discover the Saisei code (which I won't spoil for you who don't know what that is).Since Pert's family was kidnapped by the Task Force which invaded the Black Mesa Research Facility in Half-Life, his goal is to break into the barracks of the Task Force and retreive his family, after wasting each and every soldier in the facility, but there is an extremely poetic, creative and unexpected plot-twist which prevents you from doing so (this is the meat of the story)The game runs unbelievably smooth for the time it was made, and the graphics are just stunning. I can't fathom why the Valve fanbase completely dismissed this game, as its feature-set, physics, *and* graphics rival that of Half-Life 2. Buy. This. Game.			"

Literally nothing we did could stop this Ricochet killing machine. We typed Status into the console and found his Steam page. The man had played 2000+ hours of Ricochet. All he does is wait for people to come onto Ricochet, boot it up himself and decimate them.Like a gatekeeper, an eternal guardian sworn to Ricochet, he waits, He waits for you to challenge him.

												A lesser known game among Steam (and also a definite buy if it's under a buck). Ricochet is one of those games you buy on an extreme sale, play for probably 20 minutes to half hour at a time, then leave it for a while. Doesn't mean it's a bad game.Ricochet's game mechanics revolves around simple movement. The player can move side to side, back and forth but can easily fall off the platform they are on. Players are meant to jump platform to platform, but are only able to by stepping on the arrows at the edge of the platform. The arrows then launch the player into the air and towards another platform. A player in the meantime, can jump at the same time you can and both of you can end up colliding, falling into an abyss of darkness. Or, one player can hit the right mouse button and kill the other guy with a Frisbee The player has the ability to shoot a disk to decapitate the opponent. Some of the maps I have played so far are quite intriguing, but don't offer any significant background to gaze at.It's quite a simple game, and you basically are going to get what you pay for. Servers aren't always full, but I've been fortunate enough at the times that I do jump on (Saturday during the day) that they are. Graphics and sounds aren't anywhere near today's capabilities, but if you are one to enjoy a good game concept and can stand old graphics, this game is for you.Rating for it back in 2000, 7.5/10RATING : 6.9/10 Gameplay B- Story / Campaign N/A Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music C Replay-ability B- Overall  C+Would be nice to see some additions to the game, more movements variances, more maps, more abilities, maybe melee capabilities?

												Ricochet, I wouldn’t really label it under being a hidden gem or obscure. I mean come on it’s made by Valve, anything by Valve is known to a certain degree. But it is definitely underrated, people always shut down this game because it looks weird and or that it feels empty.Valve certainly doesn’t seem to like it, they pay no attention at all to it and made it worth extra less in the summer sale and didn’t even talk about it in their backlog of old games which has the description of “Eleven games that changed the world, and one that didn’t.”... It’s Valve’s first game that was aimed towards being competitive and also isn’t related to Half-Life.The game’s art-style is obviously derived from Tron, and takes place in some futuristic space planet arena thing. Regardless it’s actually pretty cool. And all the sound effects are unique and satisfying, except I swear the sound when you freeze somebody with a freeze shot is the sound of two lightsabers hitting each other.The game unfortunately has no music of any sorts, I joked about this in a video where it was titled the full soundtrack to Ricochet but it was just an hour of nothing. But this game really could have used some ambience or something.Anyway, the gameplay consists of switching through small floating platforms by launching yourself from a jump pad and throwing projectiles at other players and making them bounce off walls and such to either push them into the endless void below or to instantly kill them with a decapitation shot.You can get powerups that power your discs such as rapid-fire, triple shots, power shots that decapitate, and freeze shots that can home in on other players. That last one may sound overpowered but it’s actually the worst.The game has three maps as followed: Arena, deathmatch, and deathmatch 2. Arena is the more competitive 1v1 map while deathmatch and deathmatch 2 are more for, well, deathmatches with multiple players.And that’s about all the game has to offer in terms of content, but the game is actually pretty addicting and encourages competitive play and for you to pay extra attention to everything detail, especially when you start playing Arena.Ricochet is very, very underrated and has a great and fun experience inside it especially with friends. It’s only $4.99 and is usually $0.99 during sales. I definitely recommend it if you’re looking for a really fun game to play with friends, or just want to experience a piece of Valve’s history.			"

												Ricochet to me at first was that game VALVe made that they didn't like to talk about. That they wished people didn't remember. I could see why; it was a really small, simple, low def game. in other words to some people, trash. I'm not really sure when I got ricochet, as it was probably included in a counter-strike pack of sorts. I recently held a LAN party with 2 of my friends and we didn't really have any multi-player games to play, so jokingly I said ""Hey guys, let's play Ricochet!"" As luck would have it, they had the game too, so we installed and played it. My first impression of this small, 3-map game was ""This is gonna suck"" but as time went on, we all had a blast laughing at the low-quality screams of falling into a huge pink spinning vortex after being hit in the face by a high-speed disk. If you choose to buy Ricochet, get it in a pack where it's just an included game and don't expect any online servers; rather, play with some good friends and I assure you you'll have a great time.

												Ricochet would be Valve's most obscure game not called Deathmatch Classic if it didn't become a minor meme exactly for being Valve's most obscure game that isn't Deathmatch Classic. It's essentially a first person Tron mod for Half-Life where you run around platforms and throw discs at enemies to try and knock them off into the void.I...guess the gameplay is okay for what it is? I wouldn't exactly know, because despite its meme status very few people actually play this game - and there are no bots. You can arrange pick-up games with a couple likeminded folks on the game's community forum, but that's it.If you do own it, it's probably because you're a Valve nerd who bought the Complete Pack, a dyed-in-the-wool retro gamer who bought the Counter-Strike 1 Anthology which has this game for some reason, or a memelord. I don't know if it's even worth it for anybody else, unless you know other people who not only own but want to play it. This is yet another game that I'd like to give a ""mixed"" rating to, and there's even a mixed icon on the Steam store's search results to display a game with middling user reviews! Come on Valve, show some initiative again.Interestingly, the ""variety of futuristic battle arenas"" touted on the store page boils down to 3 maps that look the same, although given the nature of gameplay they seem to be designed alright. Also, props to the death screams and total lack of music or ambient noise for making the game a little creepy when nobody else is playing it.			"

A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all life arose.[73] The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere.[74] The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes.[75] True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface.[76] Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia,[77][78][79][80][81] biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland,[82] remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.[33][34]During the Neoproterozoic, 750 to 580 Mya, much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed ""Snowball Earth"", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the Cambrian explosion, when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity.[83] Following the Cambrian explosion, 535 Mya, there have been five major mass extinctions.[84] The most recent such event was 66 Mya, when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared some small animals such as mammals, which then resembled shrews. Over the past 66 Ma, mammalian life has diversified, and several million years ago an African ape-like animal such as Orrorin tugenensis gained the ability to stand upright.[85] This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which allowed the evolution of humans. The development of agriculture, and then civilization, led to humans having an influence on Earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues today.[86]Predicted futureMain article: Future of EarthSee also: Global catastrophic riskEarth's long-term future is closely tied to that of the Sun. Over the next 1.1 Ga, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next 3.5 Ga by 40%.[87] The Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic CO2 cycle, reducing its concentration to levels lethally low for plants (10 ppm for C4 photosynthesis) in approximately 500–900 Ma.[88] The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, and animal life will become extinct.[89] After another billion years all surface water will have disappeared[90] and the mean global temperature will reach 70 °C[89] (158 °F). From that point, the Earth is expected to be habitable for another 500 Ma,[88] possibly up to 2.3 Ga if nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere.[91] Even if the Sun were eternal and stable, 27% of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle in one billion years, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.[92]The Sun will evolve to become a red giant in about 5 Ga. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly 1 AU (150,000,000 km), which is about 250 times its present radius.[87][93] Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit 1.7 AU from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius. Most, if not all, remaining life will be destroyed by the Sun's increased luminosity (peaking at about 5,000 times its present level).[87] A 2008 simulation indicates that Earth's orbit will eventually decay due to tidal effects and drag, causing it to enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.[93]Physical characteristicsShapeShape of planet Earth. Shown are distances between surface relief and the geocentre. The South American Andes summits are visible as elevated areas. Data from the Earth2014[94] global relief model.Main article: Figure of the EarthThe shape of Earth is approximately oblate spheroidal. Due to rotation, the Earth is flattened along the geographic axis and bulging around the equator.[95] The diameter of the Earth at the equator is 43 kilometres (27 mi) larger than the pole-to-pole diameter.[96] Thus the point on the surface farthest from Earth's center of mass is the summit of the equatorial Chimborazo volcano in Ecuador.[97][98][99][100] The average diameter of the reference spheroid is 12,742 kilometres (7,918 mi). Local topography deviates from this idealized spheroid, although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to Earth's radius: The maximum deviation of only 0.17% is at the Mariana Trench (10,911 metres (35,797 ft) below local sea level), whereas Mount Everest (8,848 metres (29,029 ft) above local sea level) represents a deviation of 0.14%.[n 15]Chemical compositionSee also: Abundance of elements on EarthChemical composition of the crust[102]Compound	Formula	CompositionContinental	Oceanicsilica	SiO2	60.2%	48.6%alumina	Al2O3	15.2%	16.5%lime	CaO	5.5%	12.3%magnesia	MgO	3.1%	6.8%iron(II) oxide	FeO	3.8%	6.2%sodium oxide	Na2O	3.0%	2.6%potassium oxide	K2O	2.8%	0.4%iron(III) oxide	Fe2O3	2.5%	2.3%water	H2O	1.4%	1.1%carbon dioxide	CO2	1.2%	1.4%titanium dioxide	TiO2	0.7%	1.4%phosphorus pentoxide	P2O5	0.2%	0.3%Total	99.6%	99.9%Earth's mass is approximately 5.97×1024 kg (5,970 Yg).

Due to mass segregation, the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.[103]The most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all oxides: chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%. Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash, and soda.[102][103][104]Internal structureMain article: Structure of the EarthEarth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohorovičić discontinuity. The thickness of the crust varies from about 6 km (kilometers) under the oceans to 30–50 km for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are composed.			"

 Recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the FPS shooter genre and doesn't mind an old game.

This can be a fun game to play but the trouble is the game doesn't actually contain much content which makes it a little repetitive.

												Richochet is among the most played games in the world, and with good reason: it is an amazing game in itself, and even if Valve had never released anything else, this game would still guarantee their position as one of the great game developers.  What makes this game special was Gabe Newell's successful attempt to break the mold of the highly structured and refined rules of video game developement.  At Richochet's most fundamental level, it is the most effective combination of concept, vision and mastery of any medium to date.  It is like a good marriage that completes a feeling inside you, something that lasts forever and grows with time.			"

In Short - I actually enjoyed Ricochet. Don't listen to all of the hate it gets. Now, I wouldn't recommend spending £4 on the game alone, but if you buy the CS Anthology or Valve Complete Pack, then give it a try. Sure, you'll find very few people. Sure, the gameplay is hard to get used to. But damn, does it feel good to soar through the air, decapitate a man and carry on. Now, so far I've only played one map, and only against bots, but I'm sure I'm going to play some more. Here are some things I liked and disliked -  PROs and CONs -PROs -  Variety of powerups, each spawning randomly every time. Two ways to kill: hitting off the edge, or decapitating. An interesting way of managing how many shots you shoot at once. No fall damage! Use those jump pads as much as you like!CONs -  You cannot shoot up or down. This leaves out any potential of getting an awesome kill after falling. Very few people who actually play. Yeah, this isn't the game's fault, or Volvo's fault. It's the same with most multiplayer games that aren't relatively new, such as HL:DM or DoD. Few official maps to play. NO official Valve servers.  When bodyslamming a player in midair, not much happens, and it tends to be kinda glitchy. Finally -I could probably list more PROs and CONs for Ricochet if there was a need/if I played more, however I don't feel a need at this time. I'd give it a 7.3/10. Don't bother buying it individually, but if you get it in a pack, give it a try. It's a piece of Valve's growing history, even if not one of their best moments. Enjoy this review? Did it help you choose whether to buy the game or not?Join my group, Cipher's Take On for more reviews, and share your own too!~ _BillCipher   "

												Perhaps one of the greatest First-Person Shooters of our time, Valve has managed to redeem themselves from the absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  known as ""Half-Life"" with Ricochet. Never before has such revolutionary gameplay been unleashed unto our hard drives with such elegance and class. The core mechanics of ""dodge and then shoot your opponents"" and a never before seen in-depth combo system (predating complex games like Batman: Arkham Asylum by years) completely smashed the conventions of the genre when it broke onto the scene in late 2000. The charts don't lie when they say Ricochet outsold ♥♥♥♥♥ whipped ""shooter"" games like Perfect Dark and Aliens Vs Predator at a 3:1 ratio, and for good reason! Who here could honestly forget such classic maps like ""Deathmatch 2"" and ""Arena"" compared to the same old lame ♥♥♥ De_dust2's and 2Fort's?Sadly, a jewish plot has emerged from the murky depths of the darknet to tell us otherwise; but I am here to help you wade your way out of the Kool-Aid pool and into the ever beckoning rabbit hole of freedom. John Carmack is a well known member of the Rothchilds industrial complex and JIDF, which has allowed for a complete whitewash over the video games industry. He has slept with atleast five prominent figures in the business, three of which have been confirmed: Sergey Titov (of Big Rigs and The War Z acclaim), John Romero, and later Gabe Newell among others in exchange for the complete deletion and issue of Cease & Desist orders to anything and everything related to Ricochet. This paved the way for the great Video Games Crash and the subsequent release of ""progressive"" and ""sensitive"" games like Quake III: Arena, Unreal Tournament 2004, etc. etc. which have been sonicpowered MEGAPHONES for so-called ""Social Justice Warriors"" to co-opt the hobby and effectively kill Ricochet's community.I implore you to shell out the $4.99 USD for this magnificent pioneer of the FPS Dungeon Crawler genre and ignore ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t JIDF/SJW propaganda like Hatred or Postal 2 which have burrowed their fat, agenda-ridden abdomens into our rights as god fearing American citizens.#GamerGate #NotYourShield			"

												Ricochet is a game that nearly everyone has played for no more than 3 minutes or never even bothered to install it. As for me. I decided to boot up the game just because of boredom. There was only one server in existance with just one player. Suffice to say, TF2 is free-to-play and has a thriving community. Ricochet does the opposite in a bad way. It's amazing this game is still avaliable to purchase.I usually post a more in-depth review of each game but without anyone to play with, this game will simply not be appealing enough to have fun.

												Ricochet is an official Half Life mod released in 2000. I had heard of it many times, but never played. It was already in the library -came within the Valve Pack- so I wanted to give a try today (19.03.2017) and surprise: It is a multiplayer game. And there is NOONE playing it. Yes, literally nobody was online.I have no idea about gameplay, how fun it is or any other thing since I couldn't play it. Therefore I do not recommend it just based on the reason that there is nobody playing it.So, do NOT buy it seperately.P.S: I am not sure if anyone would care about my review. It is such an old and dead game maybe everyone already is aware of the situation.			"

Ricochet is an old-school multiplayer only game, an official Half-Life mod to be exact. The objective is to knock enemy players off of the board by throwing various projectiles (in the form of discs) at them, all of which have their own unique compounds and have to be collected around the map. The gameplay is simple, but when there are a fair number of people playing, it is fast paced and a lot of fun.  It was never really a popular game then and it is far from being any more popular now, but it is a lot of fun to play with friends. The servers are empty nine times out of ten so unless you actually have people to play with, it's not worth acquiring Ricochet. Buy it only if you are capable of playing it to it's full potential and you will have fun.			"

												Across the myriad titles released in this game's generation and beyond, there has never been one quite as unique, quite as diverse, as Ricochet. In both style and execution, this game exceeds what the players, and, I think, the developers, had in store for the experience. It brings you into its world and immerses you in its culture from the very title screen, urging you to play more, to investigate, explore, and really see your environment from the viewpoint of your character. It does this not by throwing you into lengthy, drawn-out cinematics, but with control and movement unparalleled in any game to date, graphics unrivaled by even the largest of studios, and combat so immersive, so unmatched, that no other game can quite compare. No matter what advancements may visit videogames in the future, it's quite certain that Ricochet will always be a masterpiece, a paragon of ground-breaking gameplay and graphics, right up there with Dongers 3: The Revengening and Hello Kitty Island Resort: Uncensored Version.

												Lifesaving.It all started in the summer of 2000.  The sun was shimmering on the chairs of our concerto stage when I, Sanjay, began to get aroused by our head advisor. Kathline. She was 5'2"" and 220 pounds with a fantastic body for someone like me. This happened during the begining of my journey through puberty and I detected a sudden flow of blood to my pelvic region. To my surprise, my ♥♥♥♥♥ was erect. I had read that the only way to rid of the stiffness was to cleanse yourself of the white, creamy, fluid inside. I slowly slipped my weiner out of my pants and began to insert it into the opening of my saxophone. Realizing that my ♥♥♥♥♥ did not yet have the gurth to be pleased by the large opening at the end of a saxophone, I walked over to Johnathan and grabbed his oboe. The choir began to reprimand me and tried to take the oboe from me, but I didn't give up. I forcefully thrusted my ♥♥♥♥♥ into the butt of the instrument when, all of a sudden, a magical liquid spewed onto Kathline, my true love. They all laughed at me, yelling at me never to come back. I hoped the worst was over when school started in September but the stories of ""Sanjay ♥♥♥♥♥ Squirter"" reached my school in no time, and I was tormented endlessly. Day to day people would mock me and hold their instruments near their pelvis. Months later, the date November 1st, I was walking home from school when a car approached me with what looked to be a model of me on top. After playing a recording of what sounded like a prepubescent child having an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ my ""model"" squirted out some mayo all over the ground. I was done with my life, ready to give it all up, but then something glorious happened. I spotted a new entry onto the steam store with a game called ""Ricochet"". I decided to give this game a try before I cut my life short. But once I started this glorious creation I couldn't stop. It made me realize that no one could mock me enough to force me to miss out on the greatest game in history. The philosophical value behind this game is much greater than what the creators could have possible imagined.I thank you and hope for everyone to try this game.			"

The gameplay is truly original and a real paradigm shifter. Ricochet's gameplay is cleverly described in the name; you throw out disks (like the kind you'd find in the hit movie Tron) and are able to ""Ricochet"" them off of your suroundings in order to fight your opponents. There are amazingly diverse and creative powerups in your arena that can augment your disks to give them a temporary new mechanic. While the game was likely meant to be played with multiple people, Ricochet has really become an experience that the developers could never have expected as a singleplayer masterpiece. The game is such a fluid and clean experience that draws you in and never lets you go, but at the same time giving you a better understanding of your own life in the world around you. This game supplies fullfilment in a way that no other game can give nor could be expected to give. There is only one question left unanswered by Ricochet. When are we going to be gifted with its sequel, Ricochet 2?			"

												I like this game. I like it a lot in all honestly. This combines so many good elements of what Valve is capable of, you really don't need anymore games after this. This is seriously the only game on Steam you need. All those other games like, oh, what, Call of Duty: Toasts, Team Hatress 2, Half-Life 2. I mean, come on? Why would Valve make a game only half finished and call it just that? What, you didn't know? That's why it's called Half-Life. HALF-Life. HALF. As in, HALF finished. Read a book people. Going back to Ricochet. This game makes me feel good when I play it. I like to play this game with my friends, Tim and Bob, on the weekends. This game helps me relive all of my TRON: Legacy fantasies. Some say if you play on the right servers (which are rumored to be hidden and only accessable by inputing a hexadecimal IP into the console), you are able to play with Daft Punk themselves. But if you're super lucky. you'll be getting lucky because Pharrell Williams will also be joining you on the server. Talk about Get Lucky, right? Right? RIGHT?! You could imagine my excitment when I heard that Ricochet 2 is being developed and will be released by the end of 2014. I mean, the internet said it would be, and the internet has been proven to never be wrong. I know some people have said that it was fake, but they're just weak. I know I'll be laughing at them when i'll be reliving TRON: Legacy over and over and over again, and they'll be busy collecting virtual hats/bitcoins.			"

												If you loved games like Mario, Halo, Minecraft, Skyrim, and the GTA franchise, then this IS the game for you. Ricochet is masterpiece that excels in everything that it has to offer like, Great shooting mechanics, an in depth world to explore, awesome unlockable characters, a flawless ai system, over 100 unlockable weapons, an unforgettable, heartbreaking storyline, and graphics that will bring any gaming pc to its knees. Ricochet is a competitive MMO sandbox rpg platformer shooter game.The community is an awesome place to hang out with other fellow Ricochet gamers. All of the post are, funny, and relate to the game.Every morning I can't wait to get on Ricochet to see new quests that I can complete. The game is also great for kids, and adults of all ages, ricochet teaches you about engineering, physics, real world economy, math, and pet sitting.PROS- Awesome story- Great community- Realistic Graphics- Great for the kids- Teaches how to throw frisbees- Cheap price of $73- CONS-insanely addictiveIn conclusion Ricochet is probably the best game since Half life 2, I recommend you buy it today.

Yeah, im about to talk about a game released 16 years ago.I mean, the store ID is 60, its one of the lowest since steam has started working, so yeah it's a very vintage game and I'm going to review it.This game has no plot whatsoever just welcome to the Tron arena of the 2000's.Quick action FPS focused in quick reaction time, you throw discs and you kill other players, just like the description says, it's a battle arena:Originally posted by Valve at the Ricochet's description: ""A futuristic action game that challenges your agility as well as your aim, Ricochet features one-on-one and team matches played in a variety of futuristic battle arenas."" The game is very fun and it runs on the Half-Life engine, the gameplay is very fun and the controls are very good. It's probably the one lightest game that valve has developed and it will be  downloaded and installed in less than 3 minutes.You can grab it for 3.74$ or with a massive discount during sales, during sales it has been seen to go for 0.99$ or 0.74$, it's included in the counter strike anthology pack.I mean you can play this game on a toaster:Originally posted by Valve, about system requirements:MINIMUM: 500 MHz processor, 96mb ram, 16mb video card, Windows XP, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet Connection

RECOMMENDED: 800 MHz processor, 128mb ram, 32mb+ video card, Windows XP, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet Connection
Pros:• You can install it in a matter of seconds• Its easy to understand the gameplay• Gameplay is small but very entertaining• Very good to train accuaracy• Bouncing arround and shooting disks is very fun• You can decapitate your enemies or watche them fall to the void.Cons:• Community is very small• Game has a lack of servers and players• There are only 6 maps wich most of them look the same but with different layouts• Most servers are laggy / abandoned• It's a very repetitive game. Dont take me wrong, I might be going hard on a game that was made in 2000, but as a game reviewer I have to see both good and bad sides, this game isnt bad at all for me and i dont think any of those cons will affect your reactin to the game, its a good game just to grab and play.It's the most entertaining game that you can grab and play 10 minutes every day or while you are bored.I give this game a big 8/10This game is completely good, like I said before the gameplay is very entertaining and fun and the controls are very easy to get used to, of course, its still a game that has around 3-6 maps only, still, its a very fun game that you can grab during a sale and enjoy it a lot.There are around 3 servers that have people, and that's just daily, you can still approach this game during a sale and play it, its fun and very addictive if you get good at it.

												Ricochet is the best game ever developed! I'd pay a billion dollars just to play Ricochet for 5 minutes! If you do buy this game, be aware that the servers are always too full for you to join, so you may be sitting there for a couple hours (maybe even days) just to get into a game (an extravagant one mind you). I even have a Ricochet jump pad and light frisbee tattooed on my face! I sacrificed getting a job for my whole life just because I love this game! So please do the same and don't buy or ruin your face with some smut like any of the other games they've put out and/or published.			"

TRON/ TRON: Legacy meets Deathmatch Classic... with sizziling sound effects.Oh, and after about 5 minutes, you will already grow sick and tired of the ""falling-to-your-death"" death screen.

												Hello Fellow Players,I can not recommend Ricochet. It's actually a pretty fun game if you can get some people to play, but that's just it, there are plenty of servers but absolutely no players! I enjoy the mechanics of jumping from platform to platform and throwing discs, but there's nobody else to play with, therefore, no competition. It's another deathmatch type game that would be a lot of fun if people still played, however, they don't. It's only because there are no players that I strongly advise you to refrain from purchasing this game unless you plan on playing it on several occasions with a bunch of friends. Definitely not worth the money, the games time has passed.-Kyle James			"

You try to knock people off platforms to earn points. And that's about the whole game. It may be simple, but it's very addictive. It's sad how little people play this, the most I've ever seen was 7 people, and there's like 5 servers. There's 2 gamemodes, deathmatch and arena. Arena is a 1v1 to try and get the first to 3 points.

												Ricochet is a long forgotten classic. Created by Valve, this game is truly what revolutionized multiplayer gameplay. As a proud member of the Elite 420_XXX_Richochet Club, I can concur that this game is better than most online multiplayer-centric deathmatch games around. With it's detailed graphics, and high-quality sound, Richochet is a game for the ages. I have successfully noscoped 666 noobs with my powerful disc skillz. The game is very good. Sacrifice your soul to great Cthulhu himself to witness the holy glory that is Ricochet.			"

												Ricochet is a multiplayer deathmatch game, which attempts to be original and has virtual/arcade feel to it. It was a free modification for Half-Life, coming along with one of the patches to the game, and from what I know, it was supposed to show new additions to the engine, as well as just being a bonus. Yet now it's being sold on Steam serapately. And in this case, it wasn't a good move.And well... Player base of this multiplayer game is dead. Completely. And is the main reason not to recommend this for purchase.Otherwise, the game is not horrible. It was good for what it was supposed to be - bonus mod. You jump between platforms using boosters and throw discs at opponents, either to push them off into void or to kill them. You regenerate discs ammo all time up to 3 of them. Pushing requires 1 discs, thus can be spammed. Decapating disc wastes all 3 ""ammo"". There is regular respawning power-up. And with usage of HL Engine advanced maneuvering (air strafing) you can try to outsmart enemies by landing on different platform than what is expected.And most often, you will fall into void due to your own clunkyness. Or bump into another player and fall down together.It's just that it tried to push on art direction of ""arcade/virtual"" style too much, thus it lacks any casual fun of ""shoot them the terrorists from awesome guns"", nor does it has any pleasent art in levels themselves.Otherwise, nice bonus mod, for 2-4 players DMing.

												At first I was lost in this world, with an empty space in my heart. That void was empty for all my life until I played this masterpiece of a game. It makes me cry as it reminds me of a younger self, throwing discs in the neighborhood. It pains me to say but I dont think this game is for everyone seeing how some people might not realise its true art form initially. Overall, this game will go down in the history books, being the closest man has got to in making pure pleasure			"

												I wish I could give this game a proper review. But this is a sever-based game, one that requires you to play with other people to even start the game, and for a game so old, there's nobody on the servers anymore. I wish that this game at least had a tutorial so I could try it. I bet it was good when it was first released, but right now, nobody is playing it. I would recommend making a remastered version, just to bring more attention to the series.			"

												The game is pretty much about jumping on platforms and shooting discs to drop opponents to a black hole. The game is pretty simple and you'll have fun playing it. However, there aren't many people playing it due to the fact that there isn't much content to the game and most people just prefer playing the better Valve games.			"

												It's so rare in this era of play-it-safe mechanics and shoo-in productions to see a major company taking on a project that leaves the safe zone; Valve's efforts with Ricochet are hugely commendable for the circumvention of gaming conformity they represent. They've created an experience that breathes 50's period class and chews on its grit as well, but, more importantly, that offers players a wholly new and uniquely challenging set of intellectual obstacles to overcome; fantastic and immersive inspection and interrogation sequences, as well as a solid narrative, draw you in. Certainly not every facet of Ricochet fits perfectly with the whole or stands alone without a hitch, but for players who appreciate uniqueness and corporate risk in the modern gaming environment, it is an essential experience.

												Review: Ricochet definately stands out as an old Valve game. With the main menu, loading screens and the HUD, it's obvious that it is Valve once you launch it. I mean you can also see that it's Valve by scrolling down and looking at the developers and publishers (both Valve). This game is a fantastic concept. There are many servers, all with very few to no people playing. The gameplay mechanics are painful to learn and inact. It is definately NOT worth $4.99! For a game that was released in 2000, has many flaws, old graphics, and few people playing? I would definately not call it a rip off, but I would call it a failure. The game can be fun if you play it right, and to see a modernized version of this game would be great, but overall the game is not worth the price it's sold for, and the gameplay can get really repetative. The horrible sounds of your character falling into the void, over and over... Ugh... Anyway, if you DO want to get this game, you should get it in the Counter-Strike Anthology or Valve Complete Pack, or other packs, god knows what else they have... Don't get me wrong, this game is an amazing concept! If they would improve and make it worth our time, effort, and MONEY, it could be a great game. Overall, the game does not look completed, I could imagine so many features to this tron-styled game. I mean it's called 'Ricochet', and that's exactly what it is, glowing platforms in space, that you can jump off and ricochet onto others. Don't waste your time, unless you know exactly what you're getting.Game Cons:   Old gameBroken mechanicsUnfineshed, and buggyTerrible, old HUDNo people playing Game Pros: Fantastic ConceptSometimes funMultiplayer works greatGoes by it's title			"

												I recommend this game to people who are willing to buy it in groups.  The game has a few purposes to it: don't fall, don't get beheaded, and don't get hit.  There are two game modes (as far as I know): arena (one-on-one matches) and deathmatch.  This game was an idea in which one could make a popular game with a short budget and a simple set of rules.  It did successfully but with short lived fame.  It's fun to play with friends but keep in mind that friends is all you've got because the community is pretty lifeless with some bots.  If you want to play the game, be sure that you have friends who are willing to buy as well.  If you get bored, it's not a surprise even with old-community made content because the idea is still the same.			"

												I have owned this game for over a decade and always considered it a joke. But I recently started playing it; and it may just be the greatest game ever made.I can just imagine the designers saying ""hey, we need to make a game before lunch, let's just make Tron."" And surprisingly enough a movie about being in a video game actually makes a better game than it does a movie - even if it was made in half an hour.So get together with some friends (go out and make some if you have to - worth), grab a copy of ricochet, and go nuts.Also watch out for the one remaining hacker in this game - seriously, who cheats at Ricochet?

												For thousands of years the human race has strived towards an ultimate goal.We never quite understood what the ultimate goal was; we never understood why we were put on this planet in the first place.I believe it was for Ricochet. Ricochet is the best human accomplishment by far. I've never experienced such a faced-paced, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-tightening, pants-ruining thrill ride. If you're looking for a rich story, you've come to the right place. You thought Mario and Dark Souls had the deepest lore? Think again, Mary. Ricochet is filled with conspiracy and non-linear storytelling. I can promise you that you'll never find all of the backstory due to its massive size. Don't worry, the gameplay is top-notch, too. This ♥♥♥♥'s like 90's Tron mixed with Sonic the Hedgehog. It's the pinnacle of human achievement. The best game you will ever play with friends. And it's even better when you're by yourself.

												Ricochet is a very pleasant surprise - it is one of the funnest games I have ever played. From reviews I would've thought it's just one of those ""10 minutes at a time"" and at first that was true. For the first match I played. However, very soon after that, my friends bought Ricochet as well after seeing me play so we got into a server with about 15 other people and had the fun of our lives. It is highly addictive as nicotine. The graphics are nicely done for the time and never once did I think the game is ugly. There isn't much variety in the gameplay, but it is fun and you will come back to it daily. Good thing is that if you have friends this game is an ABSOLUTE BLAST and you will love it for however long you play it. One time I played the game for 100 minutes straight, until I realised I was playing too much.Get this game... NOW!And the game isn't dead, as the people say. It has a great community with really funny people, and sometimes the servers can have more than 15 players, and that is ♥♥♥♥ing chaos when you don't even know what is happening, but usually there's about 10 people playing overall, so bring your friends over and have fun.

												I recommend this game to people who are willing to buy it in groups.  The game has a few purposes to it: don't fall, don't get beheaded, and don't get hit.  There are two game modes (as far as I know): arena (one-on-one matches) and deathmatch.  This game was an idea in which one could make a popular game with a short budget and a simple set of rules.  It did successfully but with short lived fame.  It's fun to play with friends but keep in mind that friends is all you've got because the community is pretty lifeless with some bots.  If you want to play the game, be sure that you have friends who are willing to buy as well.  If you get bored, it's not a surprise even with old-community made content because the idea is still the same.			"

												Ricochet is probably the apex of gameplay and story-telling in the game industry. The graphics for exceeded anything of its time and the humor is unrivaled. This game is an absolute gem with a great atmosphere and fantastic lighting to go along with it. The multiplayer is composed of fast-paced, balanced and strategic action whereas the single-player is the most immersive experience you could ever experience, spanning over more than fifty hours. The characters are incredibly realistic in terms of their behaviour and their voice lines and serve the plot well. This game is easily worth sixty euros and it costing only fives makes buying it more than worth it.			"

PROS:+ cool gameplay+ many modsCONS:- not that many active playersComment:This game has a similar issue as other old Valve multiplayer games, the days when this game had many players are gone. Today the community of active players is small and there are not a lot of games to join (I just found a couple of servers with 2 people each). I got this game for free with Counter Strike 1.6 and decided to give it a go. It's a Tron type game with the matching visuals. The gameplay is about disk throwing and pushing your opponents off the platforms. Which is great but lack of people to actually play with pulls down the score a little bit. However even dueling one person is good fun so I recommend it.			"

 Introduction VALVe's mostly unknown experiment with the GoldSrc engine. This platform-esque shooter was the source of VALVes most hated projects, lauding it's ridiculous concept and lack of support. Gameplay The gameplay is platform-based first person shooting as (and might I add eerily) same vain as Tron, the famous sci-fi film. You must knock each other or shoot discs at the head to score points for a kill or knock them off the platforms to also score a kill/frag. Recommendations Having played through it, the charm and potential for a sequel is quite possible. Criticisms  Major One map is literally all there is to this game, so variety becomes a serious issue for a paid game that is for £4.00. Due to it's lack of popularity, this game never developed very well nor did it evolve with modifications to it's Goldsrc counterpart, it is quintessentially a dead game, often used mockingly to name a certain ""third project"" VALVe is doing.The game only has 1-5 players playing. Don't believe me? Go to the server browser. Minor Latency on some servers is extremely high, at about 100-200 mS ping. This arguably makes the game almost unplayable when network jitter occurs.Unpolished textures. Music Apart from a few screams and moans and the gun's sound effects sounding like something out of Tron. Extremely empty of anything else. Gunplay Aim and fire disc with the mouse or deflect them off bars to hit them off the platform to their barren, empty doomed lives! As it's name suggests, if you 'ricochet' the disc off the walls and hits an opponent, I believe more points are added. Graphics Utilizes GoldSrc's detailed MIPMAPPING, colourmaps, skeletal animation giving impressive animation (for the time). Atmospherically dark with a focus on contrasting magenta on black. Very tron-esque. Mechanics Jump from platform to platform, watching that you don't fall off or decelerate enough to fall into the abyssal plane! Shoot discs at other players. Some platforms may spawn or generate an ability to fire triple discs, to increase the likely hood of attacking and pushing several players off, a decapitation power up which deals out a one-hit kill disc that slices through your victims head and rapid fire disc power ups which spam out 3 in quick succession! Storyline It's matter of you against everyone. Fight! Evaluation The reason this game is not put on Not Recommended is due to the fact it was and maybe is possible for the game to be revitalized by fan/moderators efforts. The Source version of this using the Half Life 2 base is on Mod DB and improves on the formula whilst removing it's weaknesses.			"

												Ricochet is a weird mod for half life since it looks nothing like it and acts, i do not know how to play it since i've only played 10 minutes. not much servers and people playing on it which means its not that famous and not that good so unfortunitely im not recommending this to anyone who has there hopes up about this. and another thing, it cost around $2 which is a rip off because all u do is just fly around and shoot these razer blades at people and im giving it a 3/10.

												This game is actually really freaking good. When you find a server with people on it that is. Is it better than Battlefield and Call of Duty? Yes. As of writing this, I have over 12 hours in this godly game and I still can't figure out how to jump. Great game.			"

												Ricochet is a hard game to judge. It is a multi-player only mod that only ever had a handful of players, even back in the day, before Half-Life 2 was released and all the old mods for the original Half-Life started slowly dying off. Nowadays it is a dead game, a pointless purchase and install made even more futile by the fact that it was originally a free mod.I did however, find it to be somewhat entertaining with a group of friends, if only for the chaos of it all. Not the best at what it does mind you but if you own it anyways and have friends that own it you might as well try and organize a game.			"

												Its Ricochet. No more needs to be said.Tron+Valve=Ricochet.This game is barely a game at all. Two maps, dead community, and only one weapon. An intresting concept let down by poor execution. This is the worst valve game ever made. Never play it. And for whatever deity you belive in sake, don't buy it unless its in a pack. tl;dr Tron sucks.			"

Pros:Jumping around can be fun.That's pretty much it.Cons:Well... the maximum ammount of people playing this game at the same time is about ten.The character is hard to control.Very few servers and very few maps.If you fall off, everything starts spinning very very fast and you probably get eye cancer or something. Don't fall off.So...Don't get this game. Really, it's not a bad idea as a whole. I'd suggest it in 2000. But right now... I think there are much better games you can get with 3.99, or less.			"

Simple premise, concise story, easy to understand weaponry, it's all here. The best part of all is that you don't have to worry about a pesky jump function.

Plus, the game itself isn't great.From what I can tell after finally finding a non-empty server, it is just another early-2000s arena game with the added bonus that you can't jump other than on predefined jump pads, and your ""frisbee-esque"" projectiles can't be aimed on anything other than the horizontal axis.This game isn't worth buying.

If you like any of the games you have ever played then you will like this. I ran it at over 100 fps and honostly think this is the best game I now do nothing but play this game and my family has abandened me and im living under a bridge using a post offices free wifi my cat died and I missed my 2 daughters weddings. Then one day my ccomputer broke down and i had nothing more to live for.

This Game is not your regular game as it's quite challenging, perfect for me but some casual players may find it difficult to play because this game severely punishes you for your mistakes. Initially it took me a while to get used to the controls because you cannot re-map them, it's not a big deal but it would be great if we could. The Visuals are breathtaking as you will just stop by and gape at the gorgeous art for minutes. The Audio department did a great job in making the high quality sounds, even minute sounds can be heard clearly. You may get frustrated in certain parts but it's the beautiful sountracks that encourages and keeps you going, and thats an important aspect of a game. They are so beautiful that you just wanna die in peace listening to them. The Dialogues are mystically unique, they don't actually make any sense but they sound so cool. The letdown is that they reused most of the same dialogues in some scenes.Coming to the story, its very emotional and may make you cry easy peasy. Its not complex as The Walking Dead or something but its a Heart touching story. I hate to admit this but tears came to my eyes at the ending, and I'm sure that I'm not the only one.So yeah, every aspect of the game is damn-near perfect. Do yourself a favor and get this Masterpiece, it's worth every penny.TL;DR:Pros:Fluid GameplayHeart touching StoryBreathtaking VisualsCool DialoguesBeautiful level designAnimation varietyAmazing Soundtracks by Gareth CokerCons:Reused DialoguesCannot remap controlsMaybe too difficult for some?Can't return to some areasGlitchy LeaderboardBash Skill control using KeyboardSimply put, it's a Masterpiece10/10			"

												Ok,this is the only game from Valve that is not played anymore so much,the gameplay looks cool for 2000,also i think it would be a good idea to release Richocet 2 with Source Engine from CS GO or Portal 2 and the game would be so much played,the maps can be confusing sometimes,you cant add bots to your servers,1 player per day or 2.I dont know what to say about this game.Final note:6.5/10			"

												At first I thought it was something Valve employees made during one of their lunch breaks while developing Half-Life 1. Then I played it.Well, apparently it is so. But that's not all there is to it.Although Ricochet still looks like it was made in 20 minutes and is a Half-Life 1 mod, I managed to enjoy it immensely. As a stand-alone game, nah, it's not a masterpiece. As a lunch break filler, ironically, it is simply amazing. And is best with friends and voice chat.That is, because of its original gameplay mechanics, and fast pace. You'll actaully spend quite some time to master it, and believe me, nothing feels better (during a lunch break). A great time killer if you ask me, though might not be for everyone. Graphics are obviously outdated, but that isn't exactly what you're looking for in this game. You're looking at them though. HuehuehueSo, a 7/10 - would play during lunch break.			"

												Wow! Valve has done it again! From the creators of the Half-Life and their amazing expansion Half-Life: Opposing Force, I am proud to say that Valve has set a new standard for the gaming industry.The first time I started Ricochet I was mesmerized by the visuals, the dark tone, and the sounds! I felt very immersed in the universe of Ricochet and the backdrop of space is truly amazing.The main cast felt very believable, and I like the balance between emotionally driven characters and logically driven characters. I especially liked the side missions J'Chak has! Though some characters I feel got left in the dust, looking at you H'Jird!The factions you get to join are truly amazing! From the Galactic Wardens to the Dark Cult of O'Kgha. These are just two of over 12 factions I've encountered so far, each with their own agenda and outlook on the universe.I love the gameplay mechanics, the discs felt VERY impactful! The controlls are amazing and every turn I did felt sharp and on point, I also didnt feel too fast or too slow. The jumping mechanics are very good, but considering Valves last entry this is expected.Overall I give this game a 9.2/10, it really has shaken the industry with revolutionary design and gameplay, but lacks character development with some side characters that I wanted to know more about.

However, if you get the half life bundle (great games, and probably less than 5 bucks on the steam summer / winter / whenever sale) try downloading it and playing it.  It's entertaining to try to play around with, it's pretty simple but hard to control.  It's worth the experience, and last I checked there are still servers up.			"

												I'll recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the FPS shooter genre and doesn't mind an old game. This can be a fun game to play but the trouble is the game doesn't actually contain much content which makes it a little repetitive therefore not many people plays it. I recommend playing this game with your friends and I'll guarantee you'll have a lot of fun (maybe).			"

												Throughout my whole life, I have never been very good at frisbee. I have tried to join an ultimate frisbee team, tried to play frisbee at my school, and even watched both of the Tron movies twenty times over... but alas, I still cannot throw a frisbee straight. I thought my dream career of frisbee champion was destined to fail... until now. This game has taught me everything I need to know about throwing frisbees. I now know how to bounce frisbees off of walls, throw three fribees at once, and even decapiate people with frisbees. After only 30 minutes of playing this game, I have become the world Ultimate Frisbee champion. Thank you Ricochet... you have saved my dream... you have made my life worth living.10/10 IGN10/10 The Verge10/10 PCGamer10/10 Gameinformer 10/10 PCmagVery Positive Steam ReviewsWhere is Ricochet 2????

The server's are like almost all but dead and some server's will have some bot's to kill, I was lucky first I found a server with just bot's. Then later I tired again and found a server with one person, then it grew into two and then three people. But it just doesn't have enough player's for me to keep this in my game list.

												I think Ricochet can be quite a fun game....if you have people to play with.Since this is an online only multiplayer deathmatch game, you have to play on a server with other people. The problem if you want to play this game today is that barely anyone is online, and the ones who are have very small servers with one or two people. Everyone else is off playing Counter Strike or Team Fortress. For this reason alone, I wouldn't buy it unless you have friends who like the game or if it's on sale for a few pennies.Rest in peace, Ricochet.			"

												I think Ricochet can be quite a fun game....if you have people to play with.Since this is an online only multiplayer deathmatch game, you have to play on a server with other people. The problem if you want to play this game today is that barely anyone is online, and the ones who are have very small servers with one or two people. Everyone else is off playing Counter Strike or Team Fortress. For this reason alone, I wouldn't buy it unless you have friends who like the game or if it's on sale for a few pennies.Rest in peace, Ricochet.			"

												After one whole hour of playing this game, I can honestly say that I have been blown away. This game is one of the greatest ever made, with super realistic graphics, sounds, and decapitation physics. Everything is perfect. I can finally quench my thirst to send the 2 other people in the world who actually play this masterpiece into an endless, spinning void. Ten out of ten, Valve. You have done it again.			"

												Hi,it's clearly the best game outhere. First of all the graphic of this game is just astonishing, we can clearly see that our dear lord gaben blessed this piece of art. Second the abondance of servers make both the connection and the playing experience enjoyable by the lack of wait and the low ping. I can finnaly add that the gameplay is beautifull, with retro electro disk you can behead (yea like isis) or push your oppoenents in the dark pit that lay under the platforms from wich you jump to antoher with the grace of a young swan flying for the first time. I got one and only rebuke about ricochet, this is 2015 and we are still waiting for volume 2 while Gaben has already confirmed Half life 3.			"

												This is possibly the worst game I have ever played in my life. You basically ricochet off of things to get points in an open space land that's like a small arena. No guns, no action, bad graphics, nothing fun about this game. Only saw 6 people playing online. 2 servers.			"

Ricochet is so bad that it's not good, but just terribly bad, though a little worse than that so it actually gets back on ""♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME""-level.
