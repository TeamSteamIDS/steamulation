I had an absolute ball with Gatling Gears! I was looking for a few good twin-stick shooters with full controller support, and among the many I've tried, this is one of my favorites. I've spent over 16 hours on it so far, and I played all the way to the end, fully upgrading my character, called a ""Walker.""The graphics and animations are wonderful! The screen is very clear, and the characters have unique attributes and expressions which make them identifiable. If you pay attention, you'll even notice quite a bit of humor, particularly in how the workers on the conveyer belts move, the billboards, and the final boss battle. The soundtrack is also good, and it's extremely helpful while playing, because certain sound effects alert you to what's coming. I played most of the game with the sound off, just so I didn't disturb my husband watching T.V., but if you leave the sound on, you'll have even quicker reaction times with the advance warning that the sound effects can provide.GameplayYour character is the uncle, and you're in a mech called a walker. This walker can be upgraded multiple times, and gold bars are the currency by which this is accomplished. Bars are obtained through normal gameplay as you complete levels. You also gain experience points through gameplay, and these are used for cosmetic unlockables: skins, effects, and pets. These don't impact gameplay in any way and are purely cosmetic but can certainly gain you some bragging rights.There are 5 full chapters, each with area levels that progressively introduce more enemies and increased projectile speed. The game sports fully functional, and very responsive, controller support, so this is definitely a game that can be fully enjoyed with a controller. I used an XBox 360 and didn't have any issues in that regard. Gatling Gears can be played on easy, normal, and hard difficulty levels, and it also includes campaign and survival modes. Additionally, you can resume the game right where you left off if you die or exit the game. You have 3 lives, but never fear, this is not a permadeath situation, because once you've completed a level within a chapter, you can always pick right back up where you left off, and any upgrades or unlockables stay with your walker. You'll never go any further back than repeating the specific area where you died.Hardcore gamers, never fear, because you can still strut your stuff and create an even harder challenge by utilizing the hard difficulty setting or simply not using grenades and rockets. If that's not enough for you, then you can actually use gold bars to reverse upgrades, creating a whole new difficulty level for those who are gluttons for punishment. If you're into co-op, the niece can also be played for some tagteam bad-assery.Overall I really enjoyed this game. I paid full price for it, simply because I wanted to play it, and I'm very glad that I did. I've gotten over 16 hours of enjoyment out of it already, and I can see myself spending more time with it to obtain the remaining achievements. I definitely recommend it to both casual and hardcore gamers and also those who enjoy twin-stick or arcade shooters. It was a whole lot of fun.			"

												Combine Metal Slug, Ikari Warriors and Steam Punk into a game. You now have Gatling Gears!What a great twin stick shooter from Vangaurd Games! It's a BLAST to play!My nephew and I had so much fun, we completed the entire game in one day!GREAT NEWS! The game no longer requires any additional DRM from EA!It plays just like any other game on Steam! SUPER NICE!Pros ++ Local Co-Op - You and a friend can battle the evil empire from the same couch!+ Colorful World - It sure is pretty and filled with vibrant color!+ Visual Upgrades - Your walker not only gets stronger, the upgrades can be seen too!+ Boss Battles - Each boss is dangerous and just when you think you have won...+ Solid Design - Single, Multiplayer, Survival mode, lengthy campaign and a diverse menu.+ Difficulty - Easy, Normal, and Hard modes cater to different skill levels.+ New Game+ - Everything you have unlocked can be used again at the start of the game!Cons - - Visual Noise - This my ONE and ONLY problem. Not to worry! It's an EXTREMELY TINY gripe about how stunning the world is. The game looks fabulous and it is filled with tiny details. Some players might have trouble knowing where certain attacks are comming from because of how ""cluttered"" the screen can get. I hate to mention this because of how much time and effort was put into creating this beautiful game.This is a very easy choice for any one who likes video games.Spend $10 and buy this now!			"

												This game is really a lot of fun.  While admittedly pretty simplistic, I like the cartoony graphics and it's a solid twin-stick shooter.  You have an arsenal of four weapons from the start and unlimited/regenerating ammo for each - there are no weapon/ammo pickups in the game.  While I like the upgrade system for your weapons, I don't understand why the upgrades are purchased with the gold bars placed through each level instead of the parts or ""gears"" that you're already collecting from everything you destroy - it seems that would create more incentive to try and destroy everything (at least, as much as possible) in each level.  Regardless, I still think it's an incredibly fun game, though challenging enough to not be completely mindless.  I definitely recommend this to fans of twin-stick shooter action games.Note: I've only played with keyboard/mouse so I can't speak to controller functionality.UPDATE: The one big thing that annoys me about this game is how you can't go backwards.  As you advance through the (completely linear) pathway, the camera moves to follow you so, if you miss a gold bar and walk too far ahead, you're out of luck until you play through the level again.  However, I read somewhere that there are more gold bars in the game than it takes to fully upgrade your mech so it's not that big of a deal but it still delays your ability to upgrade if you miss some gold.Something else that may be of interest to some prospective players is that there seems to be little if any replay value to the game.  The entire game is very straightforward and totally linear so the only reasons I can see to play through again would be 1) to collect any gold you may have missed or 2) to try a higher difficulty setting.  Of course, this depends on what type of player you are - it's feasible that you could love the rampaging shooter action so much that completing the game once just isn't enough.  If you think a single play-through is kind of a ripoff, you'll probably want to wait for a sale.			"

												Overhead Mech Twin Stick Shooter with gorgeous graphics, bullet hell inspiration, coop and plenty of content.  Leaderboards, 3 difficulty levels, cloud saves via Origin through Steam o_0 and an ace presentation.   Picked this up in the EA ""indie"" bundle and this one shooter is just about worth the cost of the whole bundle.			"

												Gatling Gears is an excellent indie game in almost all respects and it is definitely worth the price of entry. Gatling Gears is a top down, ""two joystick"" (you can move and shoot in different directions) action arcade game with very modest level-up RPG elements. The campaign is a respectable +6 hours. While the narrative is rather vapid, it's hard to notice since the action is perfectly paced and the levels are solid. The only other thing that is lacking is the number of players ready for co-op - multiplayer is essentially limited to local games only, since there is no drop-in multiplayer mode. Had this game been released in the arcades, I would have probably spent a ton of money plugging quarters into a Gatling Gears arcade machine.			"

												A solid isometric action game of the mech kind that's challenging and fun enough to demand a sequel.  There's a 25 level campaign with three difficulties, and a three map arena challenge with three difficulties.  There's also mech upgrades, aesthetic upgrades and pets.  It's over five years old, and with all the isometric garbage out nowadays, I petition for The Butler to return!			"

												If you're a fan of Iron Brigade / Trenched, Assault Heroes, and Sine Mora, or even old school vertical / side-scrolling shooters, you'll probably get some enjoyment out of this game. It's pretty well-polished, with some cool mech designs.  Same screen co-op is a nice plus, as are the various powerups and large boss fights scattered throughout the game. Story is pretty much non-existent, but when you're blasting hundreds of dudes while dodging hundreds of their bullets, who cares??			"

												Gatling gears is an oldie. but goldie. i have to be honest they just dont make games this good anymore. you remember the days when there was a big buzz about games. and massive interest not just by gamers but by the guys making the games. and the way they was describes in demo mags. they use to love showing off what they done. showing you how much better there games had got and giving you demos etc so you could see for yourself how good it was. those days was golden. its just not the same anymore. i definatley recommend this game. its an arcade shooter platformy type. you run around in what they called a walker back then. and you can modify it build it up improve it get better weapons and even change the way the walker looks. its just one of those games that got a lot of love and attension. and its so easy to see. as soon as you pick up the controller the movements feel great, everything is very well put together. its also a really nice looking game. with nice lighting and shadows and sun glare. black smoke effects that look great. nice explosiojns. and so much more to enjoy. i promise you this is a game you wont regret buying and its so good value now.  a must buy ive loved this game for years. its kinda special. and big.

												In a world where Renegade Ops didn't exist, this might be a solid title, but it does, and so it's kinda lame. Being saddled with that horrible ""we're hedging our bets"" proto-Origin EA account stuff that they shoved onto every possible game for a few years (which means a net hiccup can silently eat all your progress by logging you out! the saves require you to be online!) does not help a mediocre-at-best title feel any more fun.

												Gatling Gears would be GREAT if the game wouldn't get stuck almost constantly. You kill the enemies in a given area, and you're prohibited from moving on to another area because you can't proceed to the end of the level due to the fact no enemies are spawning. The enemies you need to kill before you can proceed with the level. You have to restart the level when this happens and play through again in hopes that the game will actually let you beat the level. But usually what happens is that I remain stuck at the exact same point or at a different point altogether. The game just isn't playable and I've yet to find a solution to the problem.			"

												First and foremost: THIS GAME HAS TERRIBLE DRM, courtesy of the great satan EA. It will require you to register your game using an EA account, and will require you to log in everytime you want  to play. If you do play while logged in and you get signed out of EA, THE GAME WILL DROP YOU LIKE A HOT POTATO INTO THE MAIN MENU.That having been said, it's a fun enough game. Mindless shooting galore and explosions are continuous thanks to crisp controls if you have a 360 pad. Don't expect any depth in the gameplay, even with the upgrades and whatnot.  Though the story's setting seems polished enough, the game's repetitive and predictability squarely puts it into your library's ""play once and never again"" category.			"

												Judging by its cover, one wouldn't immediately assume Gatling Gears to be a bullet hell shooter. Features familiar to this genre include dodging insane amounts of enemies and projectiles mid-combat as the camera forcefully pans horizontally or vertically. Gatling Gears mixes the formula up by letting the player drive a ground-based machine. This not only heightens the player's maneuverability, but it also allows him to control the pace of the camera - a nice addition that aids the less hardcore audience.For combat, there are a total of four different weapons at the player's disposal, three of which are upgradeable by collecting gold scattered through the levels. Using them skillfully is pivotal to maintaining a high multiplier which will boost your ranks in the leaderboards and unlock aesthetics.In terms of a bullet hell shooter, Gatling Gears is arguably the most beautiful.

However, it is neither the most challenging nor the most memorable. It's also pretty repetitive.Grade: C			"

												Not too many people have this game,  but its a nice hidden gem if you like the genre.  It's a ""dual-stick"" or ""multi-directional"" shooter with some good weapons and multiple gun and cannon upgrades.  I recommend this game even when it's not on sale, but its a must buy when it is.  Since I'm a big fan of the genre,  I would give this game a 8/10.			"
