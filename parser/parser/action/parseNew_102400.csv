												Not a bad puzzle/action game.  Basically you move/shoot to color the balls/lines to control more land & spit out more abilities than the enemy.  The game is very basic and also very short.  I beat both episodes in about 2.5 hours.Each level has different goal, kill the enemy, capture ground, get certain colors, or live X amount of time.Overall, its ok for what it is.  If you like simple action puzzle games, might be your cup of tea!			"

												The second most played game in my collection - so a short review.First: This game is really fun!Second: It probably looks ugly and is most likely not well announced in its description: This is no mathematical puzzle-game! It is an action based game where you need awareness. Well, it would help you if you knew how to arrange colours quickly (and you might get more into it by time) - but you will in most cases simply not have the time to take it that way! I have to say that I never got a single achievement in this game - after over 60 hours of gameplay. I only used 'Quickstart' after completing a part of the beginners tutorial. And the fun I get out of this is fun for hours and hours. I do not wish to play campaigns here. I just wish to enjoy the fun of a quick play.If you do not pay attention you will play a close and hard match and suffer from earlier made mistakes. If you do pay attention enough you will win. Sometimes very fast! The next Quickstart of the game is near though…In my personal view this game is badly announced, not stimulating presented (except its simple TRON-like style) - and completely underrated. It is good enough to play it… a lot!			"

												Vertex Dispenser is a game with a huge learning curve. It's deceptive in that it has the asthetics of a casual game but the gameplay of chess. If you love logic puzzles and playing relaxing games before bed, Vertex Dispenser is recommended.			"

												A deceptively simple and graphically minimal game with chill electronic music, Vertex Dispenser is both fun and challenging - offering one part problem solving and one part competitive strategy. We greatly enjoyed the multiplayer vs. A.I. more than anything, though.The main shortcoming is the extreme minimalism.  The game could do with a bit of polish in its UI and graphics.  Simple doesn't have to mean sloppy. Nevertheless, one of my favorites in the genre since the first Hexxagon.			"

												An intriguing concept! Definitely worth checking out.Kind of like mixing Volfied with a moebius strip, added skills and color puzzles.What the hell is that even? Well, see for yourself. It's fun. Although I do advise to wait for a sale, anything 50% or higher would do.			"

												One of very few games in the CRTS genre, its depth and complexity stem from mechanics reminiscent of a falling block puzzle game.  It's up there among my absolute favorite games, I just wish it was more well-known.			"

												I usually tell my friends that I like smart, innovative games.  Now I realize I was wrong.I commend the creator for doing something very different, and not trying to dumb down the mechanics.  I am also completely overwhelmed by the sheer number of different abilities all mapped to separate keys and the boggling amount of information changing at an inhumanly quick pace.  I feel like super advanced AI would love playing this game, but I am a mere human.			"

												This is a mean ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a game, although maybe it's just my horrible lack of skill at RTSes. I want to describe it sort of as a puzzle-RTS? The only 'resources' are the color of points you control, allowing abilities to recharge faster the more of X color node you have. Try the demo? I straight up can't give a good confirm/deny if you'd like this one with ease like some other things. This is a competent little title that I just blow goats at.			"

												The idea is really nice. It's just that it's very difficult to get the right setup. At higher levels you don't even get the chance to setup something correctly, you just bash as hard as you can to try to defeat the cheating AI. Just think of starting with a power of 1 versus 5, and this time it's not really strategy, because your just by yourself. A little traingled tank with a laser beam.			"

												Interesting concept, poor execution. It seems like they couldn't make the AI intelligent enough on it's own, so they decided to just throw BS scenarios in to make it ""hard"". Also the controls feel pretty laggy. At times its fun, most of the time it's just ""meh"".			"
