												Blacklight Tango Down is the first in the series of Blacklight games; currently there are two, and this is the prequel to Blacklight Retribution.In terms of gameplay, this game is amazing despite multiplayer being dead. For $1 Black Ops; the semi-campaign mode of this game is quite worth it. The AI seems to actually be better than the AI in Blacklight Retribution's Onslaught mode and while it lacks the content of Blacklight Retribution, it is still quite a classic game. Only downside is G4WL, but other than that it's still a playable gem.			"

												Blacklight: Tango Down is an interesting futuristic shooter that has an emphasis on what technology does for an individual soldier. Rather than looking through the world with your eyes, you're seeing it through a screen painted on your helmet which can receive all sorts of disruption such as EMP grenades that require your helmet to reboot and ""digital"" smoke grenades that disrupt rendering in that direction.While in reality it's a really basic shooter, the premise is enough to make me recommend it based on that alone. Combine that with an exhaustive array of customizations for your equipment (and not only just stats, but visually) and there's plenty to play around with. The only real problem with this game is the lack of a reliable community and matchmaking system.			"

												Strap in your seatbelts boys and girls because this is one of the greatest dollars I've ever spent in my entire life on steam and in real life. I have never had so much excitement not being able to play a fully functioning game as I did with this one. How could it possibly get any better than this sexah? Oh just implement Xbox Live into its servers like Blacklight here did. Oh man looking at empty server pages along with non compatibility errors from your friends is the greatest sensation since circumsizions came out. So if you ever just want to sit back relax with your bottle of bleach alongside your depressed family knowing that you're wasting your time on something that only ends in heartache and agony this is the game for you.

Buy ONLY for single player or co-op. (MP is dead, try BL:Retribution)There are 4 missions. 4 difficulty levels. You can also rank up (earn xp) which unlocks new weapon parts to use for your customizable loadouts.I enjoyed this game. It's an FPS with a nice dystopian setting that has single player missions vs BL:Retribution which is all MP (but also free). Controls are tight (you can edit .ini to enable HOLD TO AIM). Graphics and sound are good. AI is ok. Kind of unrealistic (seems like they react too fast?) but overall you can find enjoyment with this if your looking for a simple FPS with this type of near future dystopian setting and military styled weapons. It's a professional release that runs better than the indie-shovelware you'll find at same price. Just don't expect a lot of content. Like I said: 4 levels. About 15-30+ mins to complete each (depending on how good you are and your difficulty setting) $0.99 is totally worth it for a short SP campaign.			"

 How Kujo Recommend Blacklight: Tango Down?--Ignore the people saying it doesn't work. Just download the Games for Windows Client, create a GFWL account when you enter the game, quit when it prompts for an update, let the service update, then enter the game again and it'll play just fine. Also read the guide in the community hub to change the aiming down sights from toggle to hold. At only a dollar, it offers at minimum four serviceable shooting galleries if you choose to play solo, which will take at least two hours to finish on the highest difficulty. The AI can be a little wonky when moving and there's minimal feedback when taking damage, but I'd say It's worth an afternoon's play.			"

												This game pretty good if people play.  The game is simple setup where you have x-ray vision for few seconds or just shoot people in face.  Can also use emp style grenades to confuse enemy with x-ray.  No female characters so x-ray vision has limited use.Like I say this is a good game if people play.  However, people not play.  Server always dead really so you are spending all evening watching lobby.  Sometimes I use pen to write pretend names on my screen but computer too clever.  Game do not start unless real people join.You can play coop mode with friends or more likely alone.  This is not bad for a while but you only have limited number of maps, and enemies always same.  After a while you find X Factor interesting.  When X Factor interesting you need new hobby.			"

												 It's a shame that GFWL is being put to rest because this game and Halo 2 were the big powerhouses of GFWL. Blacklight Retribution is a fun and expansive F2P game but this was a great kickstart to the series. Very minimal First-Person gunplay combined with a small but unique story while all being focused on a convincingly real futuristic world of electronic warfare. If you have $5 to waste; Instead of going to spend it on a meal at McDonald's, spend it on this here game. Even though you won't be able to play much (if any) online games, I promise the single-player missions will be all the fun you're looking for in a small game like this. The missions are short, but they have a decent replay value and I find myself running through them every few months just for nostalgia purposes.  In short, if you're looking for a neat little sci-fi shoot'em-up, you've found one for quite a good price.			"

												Very generic but still good fun. Servers are dead untill the game is on offer then they soon liven back up. Plenty of unlocks with each level and a very well made customisable weapon selection including keyrings just for the hell of it. Like most FPS games it has a little gimiky feature going for it, the feature for this game being scanning through walls to find enemy player and mine locations which is great for preventing camping.

												Play game from steam library.""This is the CD Key ____, don't forget it""Then it must install Runtime, PhysX, and Windows Live for Games.""Install didn't work correctly"" and choose between reinstall using recommended settings or choose the program installed correctly. Kind of unproffesional that something marketed is sketchy and doesn't install in the standard way.Then the game opens.Don't minimize or leave, or else you have to right click the icon at the taskbar and click close because it will never open up again more than a black square in the corner of the monitor.The windows key + that ^ is also the standard procedure for closing the game because it has no ""quit"" button at the main screen.When you're at the main screen and got it all working,now you must click enter to start.Now you must paste the cd key that steam gave you.Now you must sign in to windows live for games using your windows ID.Your windows ID must also be your Xbox ID or else you have to click create a new one.Then it minimizes and opens a browser to sign up for Xbox live. You can only use your xbox windows live ID account so if you don't have one then you must sign up for that too. If you already had one then you can sign in to that so you can sign up for the thing so you can sign in the game.♥♥♥♥ this♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Black Light Tango Down is a budget first person shooter and it clearly shows in its game play. The entire atmosphere of the game feels unrealistic and cheap. The A.I. themselves are absolutely trash; they have spectacular aim bots that will actually fire at you before they even see you. Imagine Counter strike source but more of a spray fest. The storyline sucks; sometimes it makes me wonder if there is even a story at all, very amateurishly written. Gun modifications are impressive but that’s pretty much the only impressive thing in this game. Don’t even get me started on multiplayer; it’s full of fail with no dedicated server and only match-making crap. Oh yeah did I mention the multiplayer community is dead? Well its dead so save yourself some money and don’t buy this sorry excuse of a game.			"

												An intresting game - kind of like the levelling system from Modern Warfare 2, crossed with the health system from battlefield, and the feel and gameplay of Unreal Tournament 3. Oh and if you're used to MW2 : you will die... a lot playing multiplayer, if you get 10 kills in a match, you're doing pretty good. The co-op missions are intresting also. For £4.99, definately worth the money, even if it doesn't become a staple game. Though the Windows Live frontend is a pile of horse excruments....			"

												The game may be dead (online), but if you could find people to coordinate playtimes with - or have friends who play actually - then this game is a blast!This game would be a 'one-hit-wonder' if it was in the music industry. All I heard was people raving about how awesome it was when it was released. Sadly, I'm cheap and wouldn't buy the game at full price. I now regret that since I can't really experience the game fully whenever I want. I'm assuming the game basically lost player base due to the lack of new maps....which does make it a bit boring after awhile. However, (like I first stated) if you have friends who play it, or can coordinate with others, then the game is pretty fun.I do recommend the game. It is a blast - better with friends/partners - and provides some cool customizations. Of course, now BL:Retribution is out...and free...which also draws people away from this game. So, along with recommending the game, I will also recommend to not buy the game at full price unless you have 4+ friends/partners to play with when you want to....			"

												Ever wanted to hack and see through the walls at the enemies?! This game has put that option in the actual gameplay. Its a wonderful game that is alot of fun to play. Its a FPS that brings a new level of game to the genre. You push one button and you can see were everyone is on the enemy team who is close enough to you. It makes it fun and challenging at the same time. I have really enjoyed playing this game. The moving can sometimes feels stiff but you will get used to gameplay in no time. If you want to see t he enemies through the walls then this is the game that you shouldn't pass up if it ever goes on sale. I love it!			"

												While I do think the game is nowhere near some other shooters it has some things to like about it.  I like the KILLZONE looking bad guys and the swarm of guys I faced when I got to the second stage of the first map which you can play single player.  I think the loadouts are a little confusing but I am not one of the smartest guys when it comes to gaming and learning everything so this likely won't be a problem for others. I just wish instead of it saying loadout for sniper, assault or whatever and so on it would just let you name it on your own.  As for menu music this is good.  Also in regards to the dialogue I heard in the game it was adequate.  Another thing I liked with the game was the little simple puzzles to open/unlock/use things.  I would like to see this in other games.  Now for graphics well while they are dated they didn't make my eyes bleed.  Heck there are many newer games out there that in certain ways are uglier than this ... No Man's Sky ... ahem .... puke.  So now as for the negatives I don't know if we can even coop anymore.  As for multiplayer who knows either as GFWL is done.  The thing is though I was able to get into GFWL no problem and this game showed the ability to get multiplayer and coop games going so if anyone wants to try sometime let me know.I will say this review is incomplete as I want to further investigate certain things and get farther with the single player stuff but I have to say the game is worth playing but no way do you want to pay a pretty price for this.  I think if you love shooters and you want them all if this is $4.99 or less then it is worth it.			"

My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette.

												Considering this game is a buck, I don't think you won't be disappointed, but something to keep in mind is that this is a GFWL (Games for Windows Live) game, and if you have Windows 8, you may not be able to run this. With all that stated, let's review this game.StoryBlabbity Blah FPS games have no story, this game is no exception. There's not really so much a story as much as it was a tacked on description of the two factions -- The Blacklight Team and the Order -- which I will be copying word for word directly from the game for notes. The TL;DR of it is that it's the best of the best soldiers using the best (American, obviously) equipment to look for their Colonel while The Order is slowly coming in for the kill.Who is Blacklight?Blacklight is the covert ops unit that places the most advanced U.S. military technology in the hands of the finest soldiers in the world. Hyper Reality Visors, reactive armor and digital grenades are just a few of the cutting edge weapons that make these next-gen warriors the elite fighting force in the world. The team has been brought in to investigate the disappearance of one of their own; Colonel Klein and his team of Blacklight operatives. On the ground, the Blacklight team has found that things have quickly deteriorated and their search for Klien has evolved into their battle against The Order.Who is The Order?The Order is a highly organized rebel group composed of Ex-US special forces and local militia, who have joined the cause. As former members of various militaries, these rogue soldiers use their top level training to build daunting fortifications that shield the construction of an advanced infrastructure that supplements further development of their own impresive cache of military hardware and new technology. Their equipment is the best hardware and technology that money can buy, purchased using their military contacts throughout the world.Graphics / AestheticsGraphics do support up to 1080p, but there are pretty much only two options out of the entire list, and that would be shader details (Which are on a number-based option, from 1-5), and the resolution. I guess you could include brightness, but bare with me on what I'm about to say. The aesthetics in this game are obstensibly giving a bleak apocalyptic setting, and your Hyper Reality Visor pretty much takes you out of the vision that you might be playing a liquidated fallout game GameplayAside from what you can expect from most FPS games these days, offering TDM, DM, S&D, CTF, and other strange variations, there's not much you can expect out of this game either. That's not to say this game was lackluster, but the main gimmick was that there was HRV, but it didn't hold out much hope when the majority of the maps were relatively small. When you aimed down sights, the weapon model would move directly to the middle of the screen. I guess one could say it was to make it simialr to doom, but I don't see the reference.Blacklight Retribution certainly had some changes that were for the better though. The addition of the tactical gear may not seem innovative, but compared to how it was in Tango Down, it actually seems laughable; These healing and ammunation stations that players would have, it almost seems as if it were abusable, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was. Customization remains to be a feature, that along with the story, needed an explanation for in a different tab. It was neat to have, but much like how I've been building this review, came with some setbacks. The level requirement for each one was set at an ungodly curve, requiring you to play a LOt to get the ""Doritos Pro MLG Swagging gear"", which I imagine the people who have probably did not even make it to rank 70, because of the lack of players.Hacking nodes or different terminals in the game is pretty much as innovative as the way nodes are hacked in BL:R. In fact, I'd love to see these modes implemented over there. It's not always been about matching numbers, and being able to play a Simon Says minigame to hack terminals would be neat to have.Black Ops Mode needs to be in BL:RMaybe this part is just me, but the main redeeming quality about this game was Black Ops. No, not COD:BO, rather Black Ops in Tango Down was more of a campaign-mode. This no doubt changed to Onslaught Mode featuring a load of Zambros, but I figured after a while, why not?Here I am, at an unreachable place that the ""militia"" cannot jump or attack me with, and instead what they do is throw rocks at me. ♥♥♥♥, did they certainly break my bones. I'm not one to say that zambros can't do that, but it's something to think about when players get on a spot that make the crazed soldiers frozen in place. Overall ThoughtsMan, looking back at this, it's really gratifying to see the number of changes that HardsuitLabs is doing. In regards to this entire review, I feel that I've been pretty critical over the game. It was initially released in July 7, 2010, with its XBox release notably about a couple weeks earlier. As expected, this is not a great PC port, but is it worth playing after the fact that it has gotten some major discounts?Well, let me put it this way. I purchased this game because I wanted to know the lore. The executive producers and the developers put out a couple of minisodes that explained the universe behind Blacklight, but I was terribly shocked by the quality of the game to retain a rather drab story. That being said though, I believe that it cannot possibly get any worse than what was shown. I guess the best thing to come out of this experience is that ""It cannot be any worse than this"". There's a lot of room for improvement, and that was where Hardsuit Labs/Zombie Studios decided to recalibrate their aim and go for the bullseye. With the community nearly hitting a cultist status, I'd have to say that there's not much stopping the players nor the original developers from going up.BottomlineYou're paying a buck to play about 5-7 maps of campaign mode, which is at best the same quality as a Free-To-Play Campaign mode. If you continuously play this game, you unlock more gear, which you can test out with said bots for a higher score. Multiplayer is possible, but best of luck to finding a player. How to install this gameSeeing as how I somehow used black magic to play this game, I guess I should share how to install it. I am currently using Windows 8.1, so when you get this game, just get the GFWL installer client from the xbox site, then right-click on it, go to compatibility, and run it as a Windows 7 Application, as well as making sure that it runs as admin.install from there, and then play yer game. Of course if you haven't already, make sure you have a Microsoft ID to sign-in.			"

Now if I could only get a multiplayer server running I do beleive I would spend many hours plying this game. If I can host a server for the game I will put it up and let it run 24/7 for a month on my home server..if the logs show it is being used I will leave it up forever,this game should not be alowed to die.

												Truth is, this game is/was not THAT bad. Bought this game at release for 15 euro but right from the start there were only few people playing. There were only a few boring maps and gameplay was nothing special so people quit playing. Right now the game is only costs 1 euro which isn't that bad but unless you've got some friends to play with you're stuck playing a few black ops missions.			"

												Had potential. Player base is way too low / non-existant. If you have a friend that already owns it and the gameplay seems interesting to you (COD style), then get it. Other wise just move along.			"

												A fail shooter with no online players. Don't bother wasting your money. Poor design, poor game play, poor user interface, poor everything! Stay away at all costs.			"

												So many excellent gameplay elements, so much fun to play, visually pleasing.  Unfortunately plagued by Games for Windows LIVE, and a lack of interest from Cawadoody dickwads.			"

												Looks like a fun game but it seems no one plays it. Too bad it's still locked into Games for Windows Live, a crappy 3rd party DRM tool. Even with the price set to less than 1 dollar the game doesn't sell. I wonder why.			"

												Terrible.Terrible menu, no singleplayer, no dedicated multiplayer (and no one still playing). Controls jittery and stiff at the same time, graphics are so-so, visual style is rather neat, but just overall an unpleasant few minutes before removing from my system.Oh and it runs on Games for Windows Live. ♥♥♥♥ that. 2/10			"

												This game is DEAD, no people play it. BLTD must be a free game, DON´T BUY IT (I ADVISE YOU).  Another game made to pick money from people who is looking for a new FPS and fall in the trap............Play BLACKLIGHT RETRIBUTION (an amazing F2P game, recommended).Este juego está muerto desde que salió y nadie lo juega. En serio no gásteis dinero en esta porquería, nunca fue actualizado, nunca se añadió un sólo mapa o alguna nueva cosa. Típico juego que al leer el resumen de la página de steam te das cuenta que está hecho para engañar a jugadores de juegos de disparos en primera persona diciendo que les ofrecen algo nuevo en un buen producto, siendo la única intención coger dinero de los jugadores dándoles una auténtica bazofia sin acabar. Si queréis jugar a algo parecido pero constantemente actualizado y con muchos mapas y jugadores, probad Blacklight Retribution, creado por la comunidad que se sintió estafada por esta m-i-e-r-d-a y además es F2P.

												Although the game is tempting, it is targeted for multiplayer. The multiplayer sucks only because it is so incredibly hard to get a game started at all. I have attempted to join games, but there are no games ready to join ever. It forces me to start a game lobby to wait for others interested in joining. You have to wait till somewhere between 6 and 10 people are ready to play the game with you, or you can not start the game/match. No one can join midgame. I have waited 30 minutes on several occasions for more than 5 people to join, and by then everyone leaves. Because of this I hate the game.The single player seems fun. Although the AI will stomp you if you rush in, if you are cautious the AI is incredibly easy. After getting to character level 2 I stopped playing, having 80 kills and 3 deaths. Too easy. (3 deaths from rushing in during the first scene. When i started to play cautious I did not die once, it became unchallenging.)UPDATE:Now, a game with a well behaved dev team can go far. But this game's dev team is a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ They deleted my post complaining of game issues and threatened to ban me. One post asking for help and I get a ban threat. I then emailed his manager who was just as bad. And after reading about the other devs, they are all self-entitled♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ready to squash any posts they don't like in the slightest. STEAM initially told me to seek technical help from these guys, who pretty much just berate you.Don't just run from this game, run from its dev team as individuals! Don't support any dev team these ♥♥♥♥♥es get on!!!			"
