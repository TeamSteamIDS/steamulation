												HOLY ♥♥♥♥, EVERYONE CALM DOWN!!!!!A bunch of people are complete idiots and are giving this game bad reviews, because they can't start the game (Because they have windows 10).

												This game gets a thumbs down because it doesn't work without doing extra work. And Rockstar is aware of these issues but won't produce a patch. Otherwise GTA IV is awesome.To get the game to run if you are on Windows 8.1 (and maybe lower) you need to download and install the latest Games For Windows Live.  Yes GFWL is cancer but it is required. Just Google it and hope the download link is still up. (It is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you need this considering GFWL is DEAD and no longer supported.)Then if you have a video card above 2 gigs you need to do two things to ensure it runs properly. GTA IV assumes you do not meet the requirements and limits your graphics settings. To get around this make a file in the GTA IV install folder called ""commandline.txt"" without the qoutes. Then put ""-nomemrestrict -norestrictions"" without the qoutes inside of the file and save. Then goto your Steam launch settings for the game and put those two settngs in there like the you did the file.You are welcome. Where are my support royalties Rockstar?			"

												Apart from several technical issues, this is an amazing game. Personally, I think, it's even better than GTA V. The story is deep and the characters are very well written.---NOTE: The following guide may be outdated because the game has received an unexpected update today.The guide how to play:1)Install X Live Less,2)Install NTA's budget fix,3)Remove paul.dll file from the game folder,4)Create file named ""commandline.txt"" in the game folder with following content:"" -nomemrestrict -norestrictions""5)Install some mods for your taste (I recommend VisualIV and Killatomate's Realistic Driving),6)Experience the masterpiece.

												This is the successor of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and the sixth installment in the series (not counting the portable and mobile releases). GTA is one of the most successful western video game franchises and it is most known for it's intense violence, drugs and nudity. Not to an extreme level though, as the series objective is to stay relatively realistic and to depict true criminal situations. e.g. gangs, mobs, drug dealing etc.All Grand Theft Auto games are set in fictional cities that try to replicate real American ones. They are also set in different time periods and do not bind together story-wise, but some characters and/or events are being referenced from time to time. Unlike Vice City and San Andreas, GTAIV is set in modern times in Liberty City. Which is the same setting as the older title GTA3 is set in, which might explain the choice of GTAIV's name.Liberty City is a replica / parody of New York, with famous land marks such as The Statue of Liberty and Empire State Building. As well as very well replicated areas of Brooklyn, Manhattan and New Jersey. You play as the illegal (?) immigrant Niko Bellic, which has recently arrived from ""the old country"" (Eastern Europe) via boat. You therefore are immediately orchestrated to break the law, it is expected of you. Probably because you play a GTA game... I mean, of course you are going to break the law!To be expected, this game has very much improved graphics, physics and story compared to San Andreas (which was a kick-♥♥♥ GTA, I might add), and the game was very much ahead of it's time when it came out. It quickly became very successful on both Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. When it ended up on PC, 9 months down the line, the port itself was rather hideous. This game could completely tank a high-end PC on medium settings, making it unavailable for the majority of the player-base. Even today, this game is very demanding, but nothing a modern computer can't handle. What is it about? As if you didn't know already.... Steal a car, drive over a couple of pedestrians, pull out your SMG and mow down a few cops to get some heat, race on the highway while causing havok all over the place, see the cars crumble when you (or the cops) smash into them, end it all with an insane stunt, setting fire to everything and everyone and make a big BOOM. Probably dragging you down in the process, die and respawn in the hospital where you can just repeat everything all over.There's this satisfaction about just being a complete outlaw in a peaceful city, that no other game can really deliver. GTAIV is no different, although the lack of airplanes is a minus and should not have been left out. 9/11 be damned, I want to fly a ♥♥♥♥ing jet. Other than that, this game is phenomenal - it's not just the gameplay, but the story, the humor and the amount of details put into the game. This game will make your hours disappear, and your violence-o-meter to rise sky high.Pick this game up if you want free roaming, open-world, non-stop action, car crashing extravaganza set in a realistic world and with a good story.Note: This game currently requires SecuROM, Games for Windows Live and Rockstar Games Social Club. So 3 extrenal DRM's in addition to Steam. "

""WHEN THE WAR CAME, I DID BAD THINGS, BUT AFTER THE WAR I THOUGHT NOTHING OF DOING BAD THINGS. I KILLED PEOPLE, SMUGGLED PEOPLE, SOLD PEOPLE.""Everybody was looking forward to 3rd December 2008. The release day of PC version of Grand Theft Auto IV. 2 years later, I found out that some GTA IV exists, when I saw ""Move Up Ladies"" trailer. Back in 2010 I used to run on Windows XP Service Pack 1. I had to upgrade. SP3 was needed. I never upgraded, and when I did month before to W7 I ruined that. I can't exactly remember how it all went down, but all I remember is, that mother cooked me soup, and while the computer was installing Service Pack 3, I was inpatiently waiting in the kitchen eating that bomb soup. Full of excitement I came to my room and that glorious legendary Windows XP background was shining at me and I immidiately started screaming ""OH YES OH YES OH YEEEEEEES"". After that, there was absolute silence in my room for a week. Why? Because I was playing Grand Theft Auto IV.Now, we all know that it's legendary and before GTA V it was totem to most of the gamers who managed to run it. That optimalization was and is problem to lot of gamers, but it all was a price of the revolution. Maybe, I didn't say it correctly, because revolution is change of something and after that it follows. But no game was able to follow GTA IV. Physics was totally heaven. It was like from another planet. Just imagine, 9 freaking years ago, game like GTA IV was out. That game didn't even had competition. Still I'm not sure if there's game close to that physics that we were introduced to back in 2008. Yeah I know GTA V bla bla bla bla. Sound, graphics, story, visuals, city, just every everything was new level. Storytelling and dialogues are gripping as hell. It's really deep and intense, with absolute dedication to detail. Liberty City is dark and so is story. Liberty City is beautiful, sad, sombrely. New York in your hands. Everybody has to play it at least once, so I believe there's no need of going into the story, and if so, I'll just tell you to play it because you won't regret it.Recent update helped a game a bit, but modders used to downgrade. Mods extend the gaming experience. Game will last you easily around 30 hours. It's highly replayable. I can't even count how many times I've finished that. Easily over 10 times. Multiplayer was and is just a bonus addition. Nothing big, nothing real. GFWL sucks, everybody agrees with that. Game expansions have been already reviewed so you can check it in my profile. If I forget about anything, let me know please. To sum it up - legendary game that everybody must finish with amazing story and storytelling, awesome visual and physics and great overal gaming experience. Bonus Point: Soup from my motherRating: 9.5/10 "

First Time Setup Guide: Making the Game Run on Modern PCs (2016) 
A Guide for Grand Theft Auto IV

			How to make the game startup in 2016 now that Games for Windows is deprecated and Social Club doesn't work		


Review:The game isn't as pretty as a game like GTA V, but remember this game came out on Xbox 360 in 2008. For the age, the graphics work well. If the graphics bother you, there are a plethora of mods available to up the graphics on various sites.As with every GTA game, there is a lot of things to do in GTA IV. If you count for 100% completion, here's the breakdown:60%: the 90 story missions2%: assassinations2%: street races2%: Chop shop collections2%: Car thefts2%: Drug deliveries2.5%: Vigilante missions2.5%: Police Most Wanted hitman missions5%: Random Encounters5%: Activities5%: Special Activities5%: Competitions2.5%: Pigeon Hunter2.5%: Stunt Jumps(Source: GameFaqs[www.gamefaqs.com])I played this on 360 when it came out and I averaged about 90 hours by taking my time with the main story. I'd estimate 20-40 hours of additional content remains not counting story missions depending on your skill and time invested.Overall, the game can be fun. The initial setup issues are what cause 99% of the negative reviews on Steam. Social Club also does not work as of September 2016 when I write this post, so just ignore the login prompt for it on launch. However this also means that the multiplayer aspect is sadly inaccessible. Rockstar made a post on their support forums saying they were looking into it on 6 Oct. 2015 (Source: Rockstar Support[support.rockstargames.com]) so it's likely that it will never be fixed as it currently looks.Still, if you never played the single-player, that's completely working. Several of the characters from GTAV are in GTAIV and further expands on their original context in the series here.If you have any additional questions or concerns before buying the game that I have not answered here in my review, please leave a comment and I will append my review with the answer to your question.

												In order to use any online features (which is the only part of the game I am interested in) you must also login to Games for Windows Live (which you need to install yourself), and Rockstar's Social Club service. This wouldn't be a problem... except for the fact that the social club has not been working in this game for well over a month now. The game has several layers of DRM that simply do not work.			"

Unfortunately the game cannot be launched through steam anymore.

												Great story, good characters, superb graphs, simply a top game but....just like GTAIII, GTA Vice City and GTA San Andreas, there is some work to do to get this game running on PC. Time is not standing still, you know and Rockstar and Steam are not helping a lot. This is how i got the game running on windows 10 based on forum readings and own experiments.First of all thanks to anyone for posts and helping each other out on this one.1. Download software2. Start the game, click on desktop icon3. Steam will install necessary files like Direct X - Windows LIVE - Securom protection4. You will be asked to login to Rockstars Social Club, ignore this and exit / return to desktop5. Go to your steam game folder and rename the file paul.dll to paul.old, this way you willbe never prompted again to login to Rockstars Social Club. You also can delete this paul.dll filebut one never knows if a decent update appears and paul.dll is necessary again.6. As told in point 3, steam installed Windows LIVE but this is not supported anymore by Microsoftand you will need to have it installed to start the game. Install Games for windows Marketplace, see link    http://www.xbox.com/en-us/LIVE/PC/DownloadClient7. Start the GTAIV again by clicking on the desktop icon.8. You will be asked to make an account on Windows Marketplace (mail and password required), do so as it is needed to save the game and store achievements. 9. You are also asked to submit the serial key number which is provided by steam.10. And to have a gamertag on Xbox live. If not create one (mail and password required) via starting the app Xbox in windows 10 after exiting the game. (i guess this app is also available in win 7 / 8). If not, here to find     http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-app11. And there you go with the game.....for the lucky ones.12. If you have a graphic card with more then 2GB memory, as I do, you're ingame graphic options are all set to minimum and can not be changed.13. Right-click on GTA 4 under the Steam Library and select properties.14. Under the general tab, click the set launch options button.15. Enter the launch options you wish to apply (be sure to separate each code with a space) and click OK. For GTA 4 it is:       -nomemrestrict -norestrictions16. Close the game's Properties window and launch the game.17. Now, you can set your graphic options to it's max.Auch, it start's with a SM scene, anyway, less painfull then getting the game installed.The last mission (helicopter) is painfull as well, it has a glitch.There is a workaround on the internet (use FRAPS & record settubg @ 30 fps) but hell, Rockstar where are you ??

GTA IV The Game			* 8/10GTA IV Release On Steam		* 0/10Let's stay ojective on this one, I downvoted this title not because I didn't enjoy the game but because I really cannot stand how developers and publishers handled this product, so I've split this review in 2 parts: one for GTA IV As a Steam Product, and the other one as a game itself. GTA IV (as Steam Product)BUY this game AT YOUR OWN RISK. Why?The procedure is the usual, we download and we get a serial key. Fine. Start the game and first thing we have to do is login with a Rockstar Social Club. Which I still believe has no reason to exist, but since this is their game I can live with it... Until their own launcher doesn't let me log in many random times for unknown reasons. Luckily it's necessary for online games only so I skip that passage as I'm not interested. Fine let's play! NO. Now you have to face Games for Windows Live, a dead platform badly working which You need TO MANUALLY UPDATE FIRST, because NOBODY EVER THOUGHT OF DOING IT WHEN THE PLATFORM DIED, then it pretends your login and your serial code. OK, I'm almost running out of patience here but many games on steam require further registration with another platform (uPlay, Origin...), so ok. Then it's mayhem. I've read about A WHOLE LOT of people with this same issue: I've bought a 4-pack so I've registered all my serials on my account and all my friends' except for one which isn't recognized. There's NO WAY to get a solution for this (and I'm NOT even considering the trick where you're supposed to buy Episodes from liberty city to use its serial as GTA IV serial because I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BUY MORE TO USE WHAT I'VE ALREADY PAID FOR). Steam isn't responsible and claims it's rockstar or microsoft issue, Microsoft doesn't even have a number to call as GFWL is dead, Rockstar doesn't care and I've only read of just one user that came out of this by threatening Rockstar of SUING THEM and after a VEEERY long time he got a new serial.After all these troubles IF we're lucky we can get to the game... Or maybe not. Obviously On modern systems there HAS to be issues as The game allows to change your graphic Details ONLY IF it detects enough VRAM.Too bad that it doesn't recognize anything at all. Luckily A couple of command strings SHOULD be enough to bypass that problem. Let's press the ""Play"" button... Loading...Loading...Loading... REALLY?!?!? Luckily seems like another command strings solve that problem as well, but it's really ridiculous considering all the money they got they didn't support nor fixed any of these problems.GTA IV (as a Game)Anyways, after a good dose of patience and luck, once inside the game it gives some satisfaction. I've played the whole franchise since the first GTA (except for london) so I've seen the evolution of the games and I have to say this chapter is a huge leap forward.The gameplay is basically the same, third person action, you can do almost anything you want but if you want to follow the story and the missions it can be summarized as Running, shooting, stealing cars and drive away. In this chapter the gameplay introduces the cover systems which kind of helps in difficult situations and shootings. What makes the game particular is the really big map, a lively city with so many things to do, which means huge replayability. Liberty City is split in various ""islands"" connected with bridges... Closed at the beginning, as usual and there are the usual stores, spray'n'go, weapons and so on. Besides that there are also reastaurants, fast food, clothes shops and similar, among with the new leisure activities, such as bowling, strip clubs, cabaret and whatever, used mainly to maintain your reputation with friends and girlfriends. Yes, you can choose to date girls, and go out with friends which will call you anytime on your ingame mobile to invite you somewhere, and wether you accept or not it will influence the ""level of friendship"", which is kind of important as once you reach the top level they can help you out with their own abilities (call a cab, car bombs, weapons and more). Important or not it can be kind of annoying as girlfriends will always look at your clothes which you must change often and choose carefully according to their taste, and friends will often call to invite you... quite often... At any time... even while you're on mission or already out with someone else...Anyways, Looks like Rockstar did a really good job with the story as well, which was to be expected, but now they've taken everything to the next level with their new graphic engine with good direction skills and by taking good shots. You also have to make a choice towards the end and this will lead to two very different endings. And they're both quite bitter if I may say but I really liked the story anyways.The new engine does its job and shows the beauties of liberty city. Of course sometimes there are the usual glitches where some map elements are loaded later, or maybe sometimes the game will show on the road only massive copies of your own car but besides that everything is ok.There are few new things I really liked, such as buildings in the city... Meaning you can get inside various buildings, so this time you don't have a city made of impenetrable cubes. Of course most of them are accessible during missions but it gave a nice variation to the gameplay and locations. There's a TON of radio stations, and I love all of them, just like in the previous games, of course. And last thing is something I kind of liked and hated at the same time: the ""police wanted system"". Once you get the police attention you have to get out of an area of interest whose limits are determined by nearby units that have you onsight. Which is good... And hard to do at the same time as it's quite hard to shake off the units behind AND avoid the large quantity of units incoming ahead of you, which means they will keep you busy with long pursuit sessions before you can shake them off... Especially if you get the attention of choppers.One last thing that really took me some time to get used to is car physics... I mean, it's kind of hard and odd to drive them. Honestly, I don't care too much if it's more realistic than the older games or GTA V, but I can say all the cars are hard to handle, they don't steer enough, Handbrake makes you totally lose control, but after some hours of game I kind of got used to it... Not without some difficulty anyways. ---PROs--- GAMEPLAY. It's GTA, one generation ahead of the trilogy. Many additions and improvements to the game giving you lots of activities to do besides the main campaign. LIBERTY CITY. A very big city with lots of places, activities, people around, doing things, everything is really lively in that place. And everythin is built with lot of dedication and care for details. Even rides in Trains have a panoramic cinematic, or rides in taxis with lots of dialogues with the driver. STORY. Story is never to be underestimated in any GTA chapter and this here makes no exception.---CONs--- SERIAL ACTIVATION. The biggest flaw with this game is the high chance to fail registering your own Legit Serial Key AND the total lack of assistence. Not to mention the fact that you need to update your Games For Windows Live manually and the Rockstar Social Club randomly doesn't let you log in. THIS is the reason I downvoted this product. COMPATIBILITY ISSUES. It has some issues with modern hardware and modern OS and there's no official patch for this. Luckily there's always the steam community that helped me run GTA IV on my Laptop with Win 10 x64 and a Integrated nVidia GPU. CARS. Maybe it's me but I never got used to the car physics, they're quite hard to handle as they never steer enough and you can lose control too easily with handbrake. "

												This game in its current state of dependancy on both GFWL and Rockstar social club, is UNPLAYABLE. Do not spend your money on this wreck until it has been fixed.Edit:SpellingMy original review was posted in a state of extreme frustration, This is an excellent game, issues with DRM aside. However I still cannot recommend a a game that is this broken out of the box. With mods such as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the game becomes playable, but the EULA for the game prohibits these modifications, and making them disables the multiplayer component.I think it's irresponsible and disrespectful to release a game in this state, and to ignore the issues once it's out.

												Broken Games for Windows Live, broken graphics options (won't let me use more than 250 mb of my 3 gb of VRam on an R9 280x) make this game completely unplayable. Not in that It's hard to play or I refuse to play it, but that the title screen is the farthest I've ever gotten.Edit:I was able to use startup commands to force the game into letting me play it (something I really shouldn't have to do in the first place), but then of course, the game is dreadfully optimized and runs at around 45 FPS on medium settings, with things like character models and buildings just kinda missing. Just get GTA V, it's the more optimized game, and the more well-written game.			"

												(It's been maybe over a year since I posted this review, so let's give it a different touch shall we?)   Grand Theft Auto IV is a good game, while being able to tell a story well and also delivering it in a special way. Gameplay and driving is not exactly very the best, but this game is very good for it's time.The story is rich, very well written and greatly delivered to the player. Gun-play is decent, it's not bad nor is it great. Driving is also the same, however after the release of Grand Theft Auto V, I would prefer GTA V over IV for more control over the vehicle. Overall, the game is great for story, while mechanics are a bit stale for this new gen. Get the game, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!			"

 I remember that time, when i was 14 and always wanted a XBOX 360 just to play the newest GTA Game. This is without a doubt one of the best single player games of all time, and it is even more of a certainty that it features one of the ultimate video game story-lines, i mean... its GTA... The plot is so engaging, the characters instantly likeable, and the cutscenes are anything but boring.Some have mourned the loss of the arcade feel of previous games in the series, but this is stupid; yes, it is a sensationally fun game. You can't have honestly played this game and not have marvelled and spent hours pushing the limits of the ridiculous physics of the game world. It runs on Ultra graphical settings with no lag or other problems. If you don't have a powerful enough P.C, as I did for a long time, don't be quick to down this game. Seriously, save for an upgrade as this game is worth it. Rockstar admittedly however made a terrible decision to integrate with Windows Live, and the unavoidable Social Club. Hopefully in time these services will improve or be phased out because at the moment they are a pointless obstacle, detracting from what is otherwise a masterpiece. I dunno what all the problems were that people were having with Games for Windows Live or Rockstar Social Club, but I didn't hit any major hurdles getting this game up and running.			"

												Grand Theft Auto is great. No doubt. But the port they made of this game to PC was nothing to be proud of. They require you to log into some sort of windows live account to play online, and the modding community had to make a fix just so players could boot up the game. I would link people to youtube video I found for the startup crashing fix... but the link is in my other computers internet history. I do recommend visiting gta4-mods.com if you intend on playing this after completing the main story line as modding this game gives it soo much more replay value.Rockstar you make good games but for godsake... a billion dollar company... And you can't fix your game making indenpendant users do it for you. And then you wonder why you get complaints by those who don't know how to use google to find the fixes...			"

												This game was a revolution and it's still one of the best games of this generation. The graphics were excelent and the driving was a great improvement. The only issue was the fighting and shooting system, because it made you slow and you couldn't move freely like it was in previous games. The storyline was deep. It showed characters with ""real life"" emotions and made you think before doing something. This GTA showed the beginning of a new way to tell a story and have a connection with the protagonist and the NPCs around you.			"

EDIT (11/30/16)Rockstar released an update for this game on 11/29/16. That's actually surprising. Although it didn't do the well-needed removal of GFWL, it still fixed a lot of problems.- Compatibility with modern hardware and Windows 8, 8.1, and 10. No more -nomemrestrict and -norestrictions !- Social Club works now. It's doesn't require you to login on bootup anymore, and instead gives you a text box about Social Club and a play button.- Multiplayer now works on Windows 8, 8.1, and 10.- Slight optimizations. The game runs a bit better now.- For me, Vsync now locks to 60 FPS instead of 52 FPS.But there's still problems with the game.- GFWL is still in the game. Why? It's old and outdated DRM that Microsoft doesn't support anymore. It just causes problems.- Game can still have frame dips here and there.- Antialiasing is nonexistant. It would be nice to have an antialiasing option added to the video options.Although the game still have GFWL, I feel like the update did A LOT to fix this horrendous PC port. But the review will still stand negative because GFWL is still baked into the game. I'm not sure why they didn't remove it. I figured they would know that no one likes GFWL. I'm assuming it's either impossible or it depends on what Microsoft says. Either way, it's awful DRM, and needs to be removed. Now don't let that turn you away from the game completely. It's not impossible to get around it. It's just annoying. You can easily get past GFWL in a few minutes and never have to worry about it.With that said, you can read my original review below. I decided to strikethrough all the fixed problems in the review.Original ReviewNow let's start off with the positives of this game to start this off with a positive note (the red thumbs down isn't helping that but it's whatever.PositivesThe game itself is great. I would know because I played it and beat it on 360 before joining the PCMR. Great story, sounds, graphics, and dialogue. Voice acting is a bit above average. There's a good amount of content as well, from the long story to the side activities like bowling and getting a drink with the various friends you can make. It's 2016 so you should know how this game plays out, but in case you haven't, there's a crash course of it.NegativesThis is a bad PC port. Like, really bad. The GTA V is leaps and bounds better than this disaster. Granted that the game is old, but they should've added future compatibility. I can open Half Life 2 and Counter Strike 1.6 on my PC with no problems. The graphics options are pretty good, to R*'s credit, but there's missing options. Where's antialiasing? And even maxed out, my 960 4GB doesn't even get 60 FPS, as this port has horrible optimization. It hovers around 52 FPS with the Shadows on High and all sliders at 70 and everything else maxed out, which is definitely playable if you aren't a PC elitist that thinks 52 is choppy, but for a game that only requires a 256MB GPU, I should be getting 60 locked with no problems. That's ridiculous. At least it runs better than 360 and that's what I'm happy about. And why is EFLC released as a seperate game itself? Couldn't you just add it as DLC under GTA IV? What is that all about? And I always got Social Club failed to login. Over and over and over and over. Luckily, you don't need to sign in to Social Club to play the game.And the preparation was unneeded and tedious. I had to install GFWL (which is a negative in itself as I don't need two DRMs to play my game) and set compatibility options on the three .exes in the GTA IV data folder to Vista SP2, THEN set the launch options to "" -nomemrestrict -norestrictions ""SummaryIt's definitely playable with the prep and the right settings, but it's just not needed. This is a bad port, and that's enough to justify a negative review. This is about the only time Rockstar ever effed up, aside from the terrible GTA online launch from server overload.Should you buy?  If you want to spend 30 minutes to an hour just to get the game to work, YES. If not, don't bother. "

												This game is wonderful, but don't buy it on the PC (EDIT: Do not buy if you have Windows 8). You have to manually configure the game to make it compatible with Windows 8 (if you have it). For some reason, to save your progress you must create a Games for Windows Live account. Which barely matters, seeing you can't start the game without GFWL if you have Windows 8. The only reason I have about 25 hours on this game is me trying to fix it/having it on an old Win 7 PC. I lost a good $20 on this game, don't waste your money.EDIT: Got a PC with Windows 7.

												I have not played GTA:IV on PC before, because back when it was initially released it was so horrendously unoptimized you couldn't even joke about it.Nothing has changed.This is a shameful mess of a game, so 'extremely' badly ported it makes me want to cry.-You can't log in to Social most of the time-Rockstar Social uses a heavily outdated version, for whatever reason-It uses the unholy GFWL, still-Crashes and freezes galore-Locks your graphical settings to lowest possible if your GPU is too strong (not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you, there is a community fix tho)-No AA, at all-Runs like ♥♥♥♥, even on my 970 FTW edition-The mouse is choppy and awkward all the time-Using steam overlay is prone to cause the game to lock up, or simply not let you exit the overlay-May lock up your entire computer randomly upon booting, forcing you to restart (you can't even kill the process manually)This is from just, like, an hour of 'playing' the game, too.It's still fun to play a game I spent countless hours on many years ago at launch with the 360, but god damn it Rockstar, how can you mess up a port this badly?If you plan to buy this game on PC, prepare to jump through some hoops and facepalm at GFWL, among other things, a lot.

												This game is unplayable. There are 6 reasons why I don't like it.1. The amount of accounts that I have to sign into(Steam, Social Club, GFWL)2. The CD key doesn't work. The in game GFWL client says its invalid, Xbox.com recognizes it, but gives me an error. 3. The standalone GFWL client won't let me log in.4. DRM. We have Steam, which is alright, I'm fine with that, and then we have Social Club, then Games for Windows Live, and then freaking SecuROM. I mean, why on earth is it neccessary to have FOUR freaking layers of DRM!? What were they thinking!?!?!?!?5. GFWL, and even more GFWL.6. Because GFWL doesn't work, you can't save the game making it useless.I will be refunding this game as it is a waste of my money, and I'm considering it a lost cause. "

												{{Short version: There are hoops to jump through at first, but GTA IV is worth the money and the 10-15 minutes it takes to set the game up to play.}}I write this review understanding that this isn't a brand new game, and as such, this review is for people who, like me, are buying this game waaaay after it's prime. Why am I writing this review? Because I nearly found myself dissuaded out of a perfectly good game by reviews that targeted easily bypassed issues.Now, I'd like to begin this by saying that no matter what platform you play it on, GTA IV is still a good game, and a fun entry to the GTA series. A lot of the other reviews for this game note that there's difficulty getting this game to work on PC, and, I won't lie, it's true; there are some hoops to jump through to get this game working. These reviews, however, vastly overstate the difficulty of playing this game, and as such, advise against it's purchase, but don't heed these reviews, the process of getting this game to work takes 10 minutes, 15 tops. Combined with the time it takes to download in the first place, this is totally negligible. Down to it: There are two main barriers to pass before enjoying going bowling with your virtual cousin, Games for WIndows Live, and Social Club, both of which can be gotten around very easily. In the effort to not make this review a tutorial, I will simply say that there exist plenty of dedicated tutorials on the web, especially on support forums and the like.At the end of the day, what you get is a great GTA game, with all of GTA's signature crazy storytelling. I've heard tell that there's a way to still access multiplayer too, and there are plenty of people who have done this. It's the same story here, you have to put a little work in, but then you have a perfectly good game.			"

												For everyone who wishes to play this game:This is a unacceptable game, for the PC. Making a windows live account, logging in, making a rockstar account, logging in, install GFWL will break the game. All the patches and fixes I have tried have not worked. This game is an absolute piece of trash. Hoping to play multiplayer with friends, I come across launcher errors. I cant even get to the game. Launcher. Keeps. Freaking. Breaking. I dont know how people play it, and I wasted 20$ on this piece of trash. Save your 20$ for the xbox or ps3, not PC.			"

It's pretty much cancer in digital form and nobody should ever use it.Basically, you had ONE ♥♥♥♥ING JOB ROCKSTAR! YA DUN ♥♥♥♥ED IT ALL UP! GOOD JOB!			"

Aspects of Grand Theft Auto IV Worth Praising● Independent FM. As with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, you have your very own customizable radio station to play your own music while exploring Liberty City.● The Video Editor. Unfortunately not many developers provide their players with a tool such as the Video Editor, this tool allows you have seemingly endless opportunities for creating videos and screenshots.● No Weapon Use Restrictions. Unlike its successor Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto IV doesn't restrict the use of your weapons while inside your safehouses or whether you're in a store. Hence, allowing you to shoot anything and everything inside your home as you desire or use it as refuge from the police.●  Forward Thinking Online Modification Ideology. Regardless of your view on Games for Windows Live, the online aspect of Grand Theft Auto IV doesn't ban users for using modifications but instead segregates those who have modified game files unlike its successor, Grand Theft Auto V. Whenever you would like to rejoin regular sessions, simply remove the modified files, replace the original ones or reinstall the game.Aspects of Grand Theft Auto IV Worth Criticizing● Optimization. Regardless of your hardware specifications or how much you've spent on it, you're going to experience 30 frames per second frame drops while driving at high speeds.Deplorable Digital Rights Management Restrictions● Rockstar Social Club. Without signing into the Rockstar Social Club you can't play online or track your statistics on the Social Club. If you want to remove it, simply remove the paul.dll.● Games for Windows Live. Without a Live account or offline local account you can't save your single player progress. You can easily get around this disgrace by installing a modified version of the xlive.dll. I've linked it below if you would like a purely offline uninterrupted experience.● SecuROM. This revolting abomination limits your installations of Grand Theft Auto IV to 15. If you frequently change your PC or replace most of your PCs parts, your access to Grand Theft Auto IV will be terminated. Those who pirate this product don't have to worry about limited installations.Some consumers don't care about their rights for the products they purchase but most of these services treat consumers worse than pirates. Dispite of the stomach-churning digital rights managment restrictions, I recommend Grand Theft Auto IV if the price is right.| Grand Theft Auto IV Liveless[gtaforums.com] |			"

												Before trying the game myself I was optimistic and though that perhaps people just complain a bit too easily about drm's and stuff. But when I installed and tried to play the game the ugly truth revealed to me: The progress you have to go through to be able to play GTA IV was the worst drm bloatware online registeration bug-filled s**t that I can remember. To play the game you have to first notice you can't play without logging in but loggin with your valid user name and password fails. After a hour of googling and s**t you can start the game but notice that the game resolution is set to 800x600 and all other graphics settings are at the minimun. So you go to options to change that. Unforunately the game refuses to change any settings. So you end up googling again how to solve this problem. You find out that the game does not recognize more than 2gb ram so you have to use command line parameters to launch the game - something that Rockstar could have easily updated along the years.Edit: I also want to give honorable mention to long unskippable parts like new game intro, which also cause your computer to go in sort of freeze state if try to close the game manually after accidentally pressing new game.Also, I want to give honorable mention to one of the worst menu navigation I have seen.Excluding above the game is great. Now I just have to keep my fingers crossed and hope the game starts again next time I decide to play it...Edit 12/2016: Apparently there's is new patch that is said to fix many issues mentioned above! Well I guess Steam didn't download it for me since options were still same c**p they were before. I wen't to options to see what happens when I change resolution to something a bit lower and the screen mode changed to windowed and moved partly off screen. I didn't see all buttons so I accidentally started new game. Of couse you can't skip the into so I ended up alt+tabbing and tried to close the game manually. But hey, you don't mess with GTA, it messes your computer so that you can't close the game that just froze and you can't get back to Windows either.Oh, One more thing. When I launched to game today, GFWL installation screen popped up and the only option to choose was to uninstall it. I didn't uninstall it since I though it was still need to play the game. I don't know what that was about.Now should I change my review .. Huumm...Nope			"

												Don't buy in SteamThere's a conflict in the DRM between games for windows live, steam and Rockstar. The CD Key is incorrect in the steam version so you need to go to games for windows and trade the cd key for a valid one. In my case the games for windows live doesn't give a correct CD key so i cannot start the game.the PC version is terribly non optimized, random slowdowns, physics glitches. Geforce Experience suggests low textures even in a i7 and a GTX 660 Ti; while Sleeping Dogs run beautifully with everything in maximum and HD texture pack, Saints Row 3 runs with eveything in maximum and both games looks better and runs smoother than GTA.Rockstar could solve the CD Key problems (look at the Steam forum and in the Rockstar knowledge base, they know there is a problem) and remove the Games for Windows Live DRM.The game itself is a great sandbox game. Play it in the PS3 or in the Xbox 360 cause it's broken in PCUPDATE: After Steam changed my serial number and the proper version of GFWL I managed to get the game running. Still not recommending due the bugs and the effort needed to put it running.now i can go bowling with my cousin			"

												GTA IV is a very sad example of a PC game.Since building myself a new computer, I decided to download it again to see how well it runs.Here's my specs:Intel i5-4690k @ 3.5ghz, OC'd to 3.9ghz, quad core. 16GB Corsair Vengeance Pro RAMNvidia GTX 960 (2GB)Now, you'd expect a seven year old game like GTAIV, even a pretty intense one, to run flawlessly at 60FPS?No such business. While at times I had no issue reaching ~55fps, generally in less intense areas like cutscenes or near trh beach, the game stuttered all over the place in more detailed areas like Roman's house at the very start. This is pretty terrible.Now, I hear tell that GTA IV is probably a prime example of the worst PC port from a console game in existence, maybe besides Saints Row 2. I'm inclined to believe that. Even after tweaking settings and telling the program that yes, I did have a lot of memory and a good graphics card, and feel free to use it all instead of constraining yourself, the stuttering did not go away.Now, all this would be irritating, but playable. The game's certainly still playable, though the stuttering affects enjoyment. The storyline is pretty good, albeit darker and grittier than previous and future GTA installments.The best thing ever:With the demise of Games for Windows Live, it is now nearly impossible to save your game. You must jump through hoops in order to get it to save offline, which means the online community is totally dead. Coupled with the fact that it uses FOUR methods of DRM:- Steam (on its own, not an issue)- Social Club (notoriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥)- Games for Windows Live (♥♥♥♥♥♥ on release, dead now and unusable)- the much maligned SecuROM, well known and unstable.You're gonna have a bad time. Four DRM systems all running at once, coupled with poor optimisation and a shoddy PC port, as well as serious issues with saving the game (it asks you to sign into GFWL, which doesn't exist anymore - you have to use third party tools to even get the game able to save progress) means that I would absolutely not recommend this once great game. It's too far gone to be worth buying anymore. "

And the main problem of this game is that the social club, the thing that you need to play MP, isn,t even working.

It looks very good for the time it got released, I couldn't stop playing. I've finished it within a week. This is definitely worth the buy. I had some problems with the last mission, I recommend you to google it up as I don't really wanna spoil something but that and the Windows Live thing you were forced to use were the only things that were disappointing, so if you like the GTA series and you somehow haven't played this yet, do it now! Now it's time for me to go play bowling with Roman. (oh and play GTA V) Seems like the game doesn't work on Windows 10 anymore, such a shame Windows...			"

												Criminals are an ugly, cowardly lot more worthy of pity and disdain than admiration. This is what you'll learn playing through the single-player campaign in Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto IV. The series cheered (and criticized) for glorifying violence has taken an unexpected turn: it's gone legit. Oh sure, you'll still blow up cop cars, run down innocent civilians, bang hookers, assist drug dealers and lowlifes and do many, many other bad deeds, but at a cost to main character Niko Bellic's very soul. GTA IV gives us characters and a world with a level of depth previously unseen in gaming and elevates its story from a mere shoot-em-up to an Oscar-caliber drama. Every facet of Rockstar's new masterpiece is worthy of applause.

You play as Niko Bellic, an Eastern European attempting to escape his past and the horrors of the Bosnian war. He arrives in Liberty City to experience the American dream, only to discover his cousin, Roman, may have fibbed a bit in his tales of success. Starting from nothing, Niko makes a living as a killer and enforcer, a bad-♥♥♥ foreigner who appears to have no morals. The longer we stay with Niko, the more we see that there is a broken human being inside, one who would give anything to escape the person he once was.Don't worry, GTA's famed over-the-top action and tongue-in-cheek humor are intact, but there is a new level of sophistication in the characters and the game world that raises the story above the norm. As Niko becomes mired in the death throes of American organized crime, he begins to become more self-aware. Niko's struggles with his ruthless nature never inhibit the gameplay, but instead enhance the emotional gravity of a brilliant storyline. The more absurd the action becomes, the greater we feel the very real pathos of Niko Bellic.Watch the people and you'll witness some amazing things. At one point, I saw a woman stopped at a light, looking in the rearview mirror right before she was rear-ended by a man ogling a girl on the street. The man got out of his car and went to the woman, checking to see if she was okay. This had nothing to do with Niko or a single action I took. These were the citizens of Liberty City going about their day. And it was just one moment in a day full of incidents.For the first time in a GTA game, the story is actually a greater draw than city exploration. That's not to say driving around the city hunting for Easter Eggs isn't enjoyable, but the story is so compelling, you may find yourself singularly focused till its conclusion. The wild cast of characters is part of the reason things are so entertaining. The voice acting is top notch and the characters are each immediately identifiable and unique.Past GTA titles have had mild-to-serious framerate issues and technical glitches, because the games were trying to do far more than the PlayStation 2 could handle. While GTA IV is pushing the PS3 and 360 to the limit, it also runs amazingly well. Sure, there are framerate hitches here and there and (particularly on 360) there is some texture pop-in, but it actually runs better than I expected. That a game with great AI, an awesome physics engine and a detailed open world runs so well and with such short load times is a technical marvel. For that, I can forgive framerate issues and some noticeable aliasing.There are more than a dozen multiplayer modes if you count team and free-for-all variations. The bread-and-butter of multiplayer is Free Mode. This is a no-rules game that drops you into Liberty City with up to 15 other people to do as you please. You can invent your own custom games, waste time shooting one another or explore the city. As with almost all of the multiplayer modes, there are loads of options for the match. Turn on cops and each player will get their own individual wanted level. Set the time of day, weather, flow of traffic, weapons available -- there's very little you can't customize. Free Mode taps into the very core of GTA gameplay, which is to run around the city causing mayhem. Only now you can do it with 15 other like-minded individuals.			"

 My solution for getting around the issues:  - Download Games for Windows Marketplace (Type gfwl into Google or go to http://www.xbox.com/en-gb/Live/PC/DownloadClient) - Sign in with your Windows LIVE/Xbox LIVE details. - Once signed in,  leave this application open.  - Launch GTA IV (I've only tried it with the desktop shortcut so far) and select 'Play Offline'. - It should prompt you to sign in to Games for Windows LIVE, sign in (again) in order to save/load. - An update for Games for Windows LIVE may be required. Let it update and lauch GTA IV again.Ensure that GTA IV and Games for Windows LIVE are allowed through Windows Firewall.I didn't do anything to my compatibility settings. I changed paul.dll to paul.dll.disabledNo, nothing is impossible.Yes, this is a dumb issue.			"

												Probably give a final judgment about the work of Rockstar Games would require pages and pages of in-depth analysis; the variety and the peculiar characterization of every aspect of the game that goes from the manufacturing care of vehicles up outstanding photorealism in the reproduction of social life in this fascinating city leaves us stunned by the size and overall structure surprisingly detailed. And I am happy to reassure by saying that some flaw graphics seen in the surrounding environment will not undermine the fun that Grand Theft Auto 4 will offer.The single player campaign and a mammoth MP to represent in itself a stand-alone game will fall into a world of absolute fun and durable, which will please not only the fans of the historical series. GTA IV is a title that will be surely appreciated by all players Ps3 simply for the fact that whatever you are looking at a video game in ""Liberty City"" will find it.			"

												8 years since Rockstar released a patch for this damned game.Before Windows 10 released, this game worked like a charm for Windows 7 and 8, it was rough around 8, but it worked.Then Windows 10 released, the game would not boot. Yesterday night, Rockstar released a patch for GTA IV that would fix the issue on Windows 10, the game no longer requires a login at startup, just click play and go.Games For Windows Live, it still exists, and surprisingly, it still works on Windows 10, Games For Windows Live is completely optional, you're not forced to use Games For Windows Live for single player use, but if you wish to play online, or get achievements, you need to create a microsoft account, and login with that.The game will still try to install Social Club stuff, which is normal, that's just to activate your game and connect to their servers, which is completely normal and understandable. You're not forced to create 2 accounts to play multiplayer or to even boot up the game, which is a huuuuuuuge plus.To summarize this, Rockstar finally did something good after some years, releasing a patch for a better game, with a better multiplayer experience. Props to you, Rockstar, props to you.Side note: Those having issues with trying to play the game (Press play, steam status changes to ""Playing Grand Theft Auto IV"", then it goes back to ""Online""), try uninstalling any mods or mod menus you might have installed... Currently that seems to be a huge issue with everyone trying to play this game, I haven't tested the game with mods, but I might test in the near future.			"

												It blows my mind that I can't find one coherent patch to make GTA 4 (steam version) run on Windows 8.1 (Have an Asus ROG laptop with Nvidia GeForce GTX 860M, Intel Core i7-4710HQ CPU @2.5Ghz). I have about 40+/- browser tabs open with different/conflicting advice how to troubleshoot this game, and keep on making minute progress until reaching another error that either forbids play, crashes the game, or freezes my whole system. Rockstar makes so much money, it's absolutely inexcusable that they sell such junk. I have already spent 5 hours trying to make their game playable and have decided I'd have an easier time picking up a new programming language by tomorrow or hand solving a couple differential equation problems in complete darkness, than play this game tonight (without handicapping the online component of the game with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mod). Based on this experience I will not buy GTA 5, unless GTA 4 is refunded  or patched, and the future PC title is discounted at least 20% for those who couldn't get GTA 4 to work.			"

												This game hits home for me. It's almost like I am Niko Bellic. You know those Top Gear shirts that say, ""I AM THE STIG"" on it? I need one that says, ""I AM NIKO BELLIC."" Niko and I share some common traits. We're both Slavic. We both have a good taste in automobiles. We both have cousins. We both have bad taste clothing. And anytime we find a girl, they usually end up being spies for the authorites. I will admit that I didn't immigrate from Albania or wherever he's from. But still, you can see the resemblance. The story was very immersive. That's about it. You play as a Slavic dude and shoot people. That's it. SPOILER ALERT: People die, and especially the ones that are on the sidewalk because you're too drunk to realize that you can't drive after taking an absurd amount of gummy bear vodka shots. I will also say, that the multiplayer for GTA IV is way better than GTA V. I don't want insurance, or the ability to have my own house. I can get that in real life. I just don't have the money. Overall, I give this game 8 half-finished bottles of vodka out of 9 hammer and sickels.			"

												Before I start this review I just want to say I highly recommend this game if you buy it for the console, but for the pc/ desktop it is one of the worse games I have ever had. With the pc version there are just way too many bugs and issues with the game that make it unplayable. Here are just a few that I can name off the top of my head.1) When I started playing I could not access the phone Roman gives you on the second mission, which resulted in me having to restart the game and try the mission several times just to get the phone to pop up.2) Also on the second mission the car that has the loan sharks that is supposed to pull up after Roman calls you doesnt show up half the time, which again resulted in me restarting the game/ mission.3) The map itself would just randomly dissapear and Niko would be walking/ driving on air. I figured out this was because of the game not being able to keep up and load everything. This was partly due to my computer, which should not be a problem at all considering I have an Asus Republic of gamers laptop with a intel core i7 and NVIDIA Geforce GTX 765. I have been able to play every other game I have without map rendering issues at all. 4) Missions wouldn't activate when I walked into the marker. 5) Crashes. The game would crash on me randomly without any warning or anything and I could never figure out what it was that caused it to crash.Again if you really want to play this game I recommend getting it for a console because this really is a good game, it just sucks for the pc. You can try it if you have one bad ♥♥♥ pc or desktop, but I wouldn't. Hopefully this helped you make your decision. "

												EVEN THOUGH THIS IS ON SALE - DO NOT BUYGTA IV is the worst PC port I have ever played in my life. Confusing, as GTA V is the best PC port I have ever played. Long story short, this game is broken. It seems they're trying to milk every last penny out of this game. Upon launching the game, I couldn't play online and my resolution was locked to 800x600. Pretty crappy as I know my R9 280 is capable of running this game (Which launched in 2008) at 1080p, max textures. Even though it seems like a steal, the game is horribly optimized and you'd be better of spending your money elsewhere. PROS- It's GTACONS- You can't play it, unless you want to sign into 5 different accounts and spend the best part of 10 hours trying to fix it and then have it crash on you. "

												All in all, this game isn't too bad. I've put quite some hours in it and it probably still was worth its money - especially because I bought it during a sale - but I still felt really disappointed by it, having played SA a LOT when I was younger, and it was so good and omg iv is here let's play that and relive the good old SA days! Nope.What IV did wrong was going too realistic, especially on the graphics, they are really grayed out and boring, the sunny days feel more like a cloudy day, a lot of fun aspect was taken out, such as taxi, firefighter and ambulance missions, and one thing more:The performance. It's hard to talk about because PCs vary wildly, but all in all, I have a decent enough pc - can't run everything on high but switching to low makes every game playable. Except this. Everything as low as can be, but still about 10 fps.To conclude this review, it's a decent enough game if you want to have SOME fun, and don't care too much about raging at the lag, the realism, and... the GFWL. I could have recommended instead of not-recommended, but I feel like I said more negative than positive things about the game so I decided to go for not-recommending instead.			"

 The Game It's arguably the best GTA game ever.It's got a huge modding scene, which adds tons of replayability and customization and you're way less likely to be banned for enjoying singleplayer mods than you would be if you were playing GTA V. There is a whole bunch of ludonarrative dissonance throughout the singleplayer but if you can get over it the story can still prove to be enjoyable, though to be fair there are a handful of filler missions, nevertheless if you've enjoyed any of the other GTA singleplayer experiences I can't see why this would be the one you wouldn't like as much.When it comes to the actual gameplay itself, everything is pretty much par for the course. The graphics have aged fairly well, the colour pallet consists of mostly de-saturated colours used to portray Liberty City's griminess and from time to time you may notice that some textures aren't as high-res as would be ideal, but thanfully there are mods to fix all of that if that turns you off. The soundtrack is what has come to be expected of any game from the franchise, and as such consists mostly of licensed songs which you can listen to on the radio while you drive around Liberty City. Here is a list of them [www.gta4.net]. Driving around is fun, though vehicles have less traction than they did in other GTA games and the game's physics are comically exaggerated, so if you are driving around on a sedan at 31 miles per hour and you happen to hit a tree get ready to see Niko Bellic's best impression of a slab of beef getting thrown across a football stadium. The combat is tight, the weapons are diversified. and you can go on random killing sprees whenever it tickles your fancy. What's not to like? The Price TagOn average, people take about 28hours to finish the singleplayer story mode (according to 400 players polled by howlongtobeat[howlongtobeat.com]), and in my opinion that alone is enough to justify the 20$ price tag on GTA IV, though perhaps you'd like to know that when on sale this game can be bought for as little as 6$ which incidentally was what I paid for it. The PortSadly this game uses 3rd Party DRM and as such cannot be family-shared on Steam, on the other hand, the software it uses was, in my experience, mostly non-intrusive and the Games for Windows Live bullcrap can be removed by installing this nifty patch[gtaforums.com]. If you notice any performance issues I urge you not to dismiss them, most can be fixed and the patches are usually really easy to find via a simple google search. I know that it should be up to the developers to make sure that their games run smootly but sadly thats not always the case, thankfully the game has been polished to a mirror like shine by modders, you might have to get your hands dirty to get it running properly, but it shouldnt be too hard. In my case I just had to remove Windows Live.To Conclude  this is not a TL;DRGet it, try it, patch it as much as necessary, enjoy it.

												I have never had this many problems with any game.Steam says I spent 1 hour for this game but it was all spent on trying to fix things.Problems I have encountered so far:1) I couldn't count the number of accounts I had to login. 2) This game says my VRAM is not enough and doesn't let me change resolution (I have gtx980ti). (I know there is a solution, setting launch options but is it that hard for Rockstar to fix this?)3) I downloaded GFWL from Microsoft website. I thought it would be the latest one. I was wrong...  An in-game update is required and at the end you need to quit game to continue updating. 4) YOU CANNOT QUIT. I had to restart my computer 4 times just to quit. I could never quit in a normal way. When you try to quit, a black screen appears. Guess what, you also can't close the game using task manager.  This screen prevents you to see other windows, the only way to quit is restart.5) GFWL, GFWL, GFWL6) GFWLSo I couldn't even play a minute. I have no idea about in-game things. I have never thought I would see something worse than UPLAY. After having trouble with this game I think UPLAY is good enough.			"

												after several sessions of installing and uninstalling the game, of hours spent trying to get it to work, i had finally found a workaround allowing me to play EFLC and GTA IV - games i bought twice, once in retail and once on steam.then rockstar patched it, removing the ""play offline"" button of the social club launcher in the process and it won't launch anymore.instead of removing those ridiculous anti-piracy measures they made it even more impossible to play the game, paradoxically making pirating it the more convenient option.can't say anything bad about either the main game or any of the two episodes. the whole biker setting of ""the lost and damned"" wasn't my cup of tea, but it was still a decent game. ""the ballad of gay tony"" was amazing (and in my opinion with a little more content it could have been a full-blown entry to the main series instead of an afterthought to IV).still: i can't recommend it in its current condition as it won't launch anymore.

												It's a really, really good game. But it's a really, really bad port.Grand Theft Auto IV is my favourite game of all time, however this port really doesn't do it justice. It's a real shame because it puts a damper on an experience like no other. Highly recommend the game, but if you have a 360 or PS3, get it there instead of PC, unless you're planning to play with PC friends.			"

Maybe the loving hand of God graces you and you can get past every barrier this game throws at you. What do you get?Lowest possible graphics settings that you can't change, and no textures! None! At all!I swear to God, how can such a heaping mess continue it's blasphemous existence on Steam? Yeah, sure, there's other games that contend for the title of worst of all time on here, but at least you can play them. This game...this game is a joke.

												At first I was hesitant to buy this on PC due to all the reviews of poor optimization but now that I have it I don't see what the big issue is, I'm able to play this fine on Windows 10. All I had to do was download GFWL and sign in. FPS is normal as well, some drops in high density areas but I also have on MSAA x16 and traffic density at %75(no mods).Best campaign storyline out of any games from the GTA series and Niko Bellic is one of the best protagonists in any video game.Compared to GTA V, certain aspects of gameplay are a lot more grittier and realistic. Driving is a lot less arcade-y, if you're driving a big 4-door car or SUV, it drives like a boat because that's how it would be in real life. Unless you're driving a sports car you won't be travelling the corners as fast. Car crashes, vehicle damage and vehicle ejections are all more realistic than GTA V. Cop chases are more difficult to get away from. There is even squeaking from the suspension as you bottom out a vehicle when you get air, something GTA V decided to leave out.Fist-fighting is a lot more realistic, instead of being able to drop an enemy in 3 normal punches, it takes 5 or so unless you do a powerful combo.Graphic wise, it's not that far off of GTA V. You can easily tell GTA V is the more beautiful game graphically but GTA IV definitely holds it's own for a game from 2008.			"

												Grand Theft Auto IV greatly blends a real-life criminal simulator with satire of the American culture and view of life, however, as you advance deeper and deeper in the game's realistic part you begin to wonder: was all of this necessary?Let me begin by furtherly analyzing the above: the game starts and you are Niko Bellic, a Serbian immigrant who, after repeatedly hearing from his cousin Roman about how great life in America is, decides to go live in Liberty City (a fictional New York) to find a better life, while also having his own secret motives, that reveal themselves later in the game.""It's the land of opportunity!"", as Roman points out many times in the game, but is it really? Is everything so perfect as Roman describes it? As the story progresses on we find out that this utopia does not exist and only the few get to really realize the dreams of their lives, pretty much like in the rest of the world.This motive is played really well in the game, pretty much like in all the previous games of the series, but even more so, thanks to its added realism.Speaking of the latter, GTA IV manages to improve in mainly two fields, compared to its predecessors: Graphics and Realism.The graphics are great, after all it's the game that began the transition of the series in its HD universe, from the ""cartoony"" 3D universe of the previous games. The city feels very nice, with the weather occasionally changing and a miniature world unfolding every day, with very realistic behaviors from the people inhabiting it.The car models however are the true beauty of the game: the shininess they emanate, especially the racing ones, makes you really feel like you are watching an HD movie, instead of a video game.The added realism, on the other hand, at first really catches your attention as it pushes the limits far more than any other of the series' games attempted: you can now watch the TV, with so many fictional programs that it would take you many hours to see them all, while all the same you can browse the internet in the game's fictional web, but with so many real-like sites (from daily news and food ads to... pοrnο websites!) that it makes you realize that Rockstar did a lot of effort to make the game feel more real than ever.Among other things, you also get a mobile phone this time, with which you can contact people you meet in the game (either friends or girlfriends) and engage in all kinds of activities: bowling, darts, pool, eating, drinking to the point of getting drunk (and getting chased by the police, should you decide to drive personally, while feeling nauseated by the hangover induced shaky-cam), go to stand up comedy shows, cabarets and, last but not least, strip clubs!The famous heart shaped health which you found in the previous games in random spots in the city is now gone and instead you have to find hot dog stands or restaurants to replenish your health (or, of course, get a good nap in your designated houses) and the badge icon that lowered your wanted level is also absent, since this time you have to actually evade the police and hide from their radar range for some seconds, to get rid of them.Even stealing the cars feels more realistic, as the main character now smashes the windows of parked cars to enter them, or points a gun to the drivers of moving ones.To conclude, you can also dress your character, like in some of its predecessors, to make the game feel even more realistic, but thank god they removed the ""going to the gym to get fit"" part of the game, present in GTA: San Andreas.With all that in mind (and many other real-life simulations the game has, but I feel don't need to be described, but played instead) you initially feel in awe with what GTA IV offers and how closer are games getting to our lives, but as the story progresses you begin to wonder: is all of this necessary? Do I really have to socialize with the ingame friends and engage in various activities (even if there are rewards from said socializing), wasting my time instead of getting ahead with the missions and story?At a certain point I realized that Rockstar went too far this time: I play games to escape reality, not to find myself in a second one. As such, the more time I spent in the game, the less of these ""social"" activities I took part on.In fact, graphics and realism were the only parts the game improved compared to the rest, since the combat mechanics and car models were mostly the same, or even less... I'm looking at you, Rhino Tank, which was scrapped in the name of realism (truly a pity, driving it was one of the most fun parts in the other games)!The game even has the now famous ""moral dilemmas"" with which you have to choose whether to kill a character or let him live (to kill another instead!) and subsequently set in motion a different turn of events each time, which I found to be OK, not bad, but probably unecessary for the likes of a GTA game, where most of its characters are far from saints (heck, even normal people with flaws, far from it!). The revenge motive plays a lot in the game too (again, not so successfully as in other games in my opinion, like Bioshock), while the game's protagonist gets to work with or against many types of mafias and mob bosses: Russian, Albanian, Irish, Chinese Triads, Gangstas and, of course, Italian (only the Japanese Yakuza was absent).The ending too, feels a bit sad and doesn't deliver the same closure the previous games had, that's realism for you.The radio stations are, of course, present here as well, though I did not find most of the songs as catchy as in GTA: Vice City (with few exceptions: Ruslana's eurovision winner song, Wild Dances was great to hear), so I got to prefer the custom station instead, Indipendent FM.Some easter eggs are there too (check inside the Statue of Liberty look-alike, if you don't believe me!).I truly enjoyed the foreign accents of the various characters by the way, especially the angry taxi driver that Roman sent you again and again, realy funny guy.There is also an online multiplayer component, but I didn't get even close to trying it, I'm not quite sure it's still active anyway, especially now with GTA V's appearance.To sum it all, GTA IV is a great game, with beautiful graphics, many jokes and references to the American way of life, loads of awesome action (as per tradition) and a nice story, however the continuous need to improve the way the game simulates real life went too far this time and ruined part of it.Hopefully GTA V corrected this part, all I hear is praise after all... with that said, we've reached the end of this review (quick, wasn't it?). If you managed to read up till now I hope we'll catch up again in the next one, when I complete GTA V!Until then... game on!			"

												Let me just start by saying that I replayed GTA4 using the ICE 3.0 graphics enhancement mod, and ohmigod, does it make the game look gorgeous. It's not quite up to the standard set by the sequel, but it comes pretty damn close (well, most of the time; some of the textures and the shorter draw distance knock things down a notch). In some areas - particularly the AI animations - the game is noticeably superior. Not bad for a nine year old game.The gameplay is pure GTA, with all its strength and weaknesses. The huge open world is wonderfully detailed; more so, in my opinion, than that of GTA5. The vehicles control as terribly as ever, and the combat is middling. But it's the scale and variety of the world far more than the gameplay that was always the draw of the franchise.The satire and humor, on the other hand, are decidedly sub-par; too biting and nasty to be enjoyable even for a Rockstar production (even for the guys who made literal murder-simulators with the Manhunt games). I did quite enjoy the early parts of the game which focused more on Nico, the protagonist, and his relationship with needy cousin Roman. Nico is a truly broken person and the developers managed some surprisingly deep and satisfying characterization, making him equally loathsome and pitiable at the same time. Unfortunately, the latter half of the game degenerates into broad stereotypes with increasingly fantastic adventures, and this early magic is sacrificed for cheap jokes and over-the-top action cliches. I struggled to play the game to the end.Still, revisiting Liberty City in all its newly-found high-res glory and following Nico's wounded journey through the city's dirty underside - at least in the beginning - was a welcome return to one of gaming's classic titles.

The game booted up into an 800x600 window. I went into the settings to fiddle with the graphics, but it wouldn't let me. Turns out my computer ""didn't have enough VRAM"". Well that's what it said, turns out Rockstar had failed to realise that computers with more than 2GB of VRAM exist. So I had to edit a configure file restricting the game to 2GB of VRAM, annoying because my R9 280X has 3GB.			"

												I loved this game since the very day it came out in 2008. Got it on console before I owned a PC. once I built my first PC my life was instantly filled with joy by all the mods that were available for this game. ENB mods that made it instantly look like a 2016 title and made it look even better than GTA 5. So many options with the trainer, great mod community, just overall made it a lot of fun. But this was all ruined this last year when GFW decided they were going to release a new patch. now my game won't even start up. I've tried unistalling it completely and deleting all of the files, but it didn't do any good. Seriously so upset by this. How can you ruin one of the best games to ever be released? GFW seems to always feel the need to stick their nose in places it doesn't belong. It almost seems as though everytime a great game is released; they need to go and mess it up beyond repair. Would absolutely LOVE to give this game a good review, but I just can't. Not until these issues have been resolved.			"

												Worse than GTA 5 in every way but until that's released on the PC, this will have to do.There's something magical about the GTA series that transforms peaceful adults / children / pensioners into murderous psychopaths. There are hundreds of well thought-out and diverse missions to complete, though let's be honest- nobody really cares about them that much. The real magic with GTA happens when you explore the city and get side-tracked by something small that quickly escalates into a 4-star police chase with dozens of casualties. I can't help myself, and I don't know anybody who can!The gameplay is clunky and the graphics are blocky, though the sheer scale and ambition of this game more than compensates. The PC version is a fairly lousy port. You have some additional graphics options but it isn't well optimised and you have to log in to 3 THINGS before you can play the game! (Steam, Rockstar Social and Windows Live). At its launch it was also horribly buggy and I lost many a save from stupid game crashes and corruptions. Most of that is now sorted out, so there's probably not been a better time to play this game whilst waiting for the far-superior 5th instalment to be released.No other series can come close to matching what the GTA series pulls off. Although controversial, the game has a sense of humour and is surprisingly likeable for a game that wants you to kill lots of innocent people. Perhaps it's because the game can be played so peacefully. You can slowly drive about while listening to the hundreds of music tracks on offer, playing occasional games of pool or bowling. You can go get drunk in a bar and stumble about (probably the best use of the free-form animation system, EVER) or you can go and watch a comedy act. It's a living, breathing city where death and destruction are only ever seconds away.			"

												I have played over 1000 hours in non-steam versionEpic crime drama set in fictional version of New York (Liberty City), tells a story about Niko Bellic who just came in from Serbia seeking for the american dream that his cousin Roman told him about, apparently it's all lies crime depicted in this game is dark and gritty forget hollywood-action movie styled gangster personalities. The game itself also filled with present day pop-culture, political satires and parodies you could laugh to yourself while listening to the radio or watching the TV show and the ingame internet.     The story line itself is comparable to 5 stars quality movie, as the player gets involved with the story of modern day balkan immigrant Niko Bellic as he travels to Liberty City seeking refuge from Serbia and his past. Throughout the way, the player feels sympathy and passion for Niko as he goes through love, hate, revenge, and all the modern emotions in real life with GTA IV. Liberty City of course based on New York, there are some familiar landmarks where epic shootouts take place in the game. The game is worthwhile just for the storyline and all the interesting characters alone that are involved with Niko's criminal activities in Liberty City.GTA IV has great story, and one becomes rather fascinated with all the characters towards the middle part of this experience. So before playing the newly released GTA V, take a step in a few years and play a game that truly revolutionized the GTA franchise, IV.Pros:+Great story+One of the best voice acting in video game+Good Soundtrack +Great ""dark"" vibe+Realistic physics engine (Euphoria Technology), still better than Watch Dogs+Video editor, great for movie making+Modding of courseCons:-Games For Windows Live (no explanation needed its pure sh*t)-Console port, need a good pc to run in good settings-(For some audience)Slow paced gameplay, dont expect Michael Bay-esque gameplay-Clumsy controls great animation thoughScore: 92/100			"

												Before I begin I want to clarify for the ""Not recommended"" vote.The GTA series were always about having fun, reliving film/tv tropes and poking fun at everything, even the game itself.GTA IV was like a bucket of cold water after experiencing the GTA 3 series/arch.A grittier and realistic approach coupled with unrelatable characters/plot, three different sign-in services, a lockdown on easily modifiable content and technology-over-substance mentality made this game become vaguely entertaining rather the hits it's predecessors were. Not to mention that parachutes, airplanes, customization garages, tanks, tattoos, haircuts were removed, all for the sake of realism.I could have overlooked all the previously mentioned issues if it wasn't for the most infuriating feature in this game, the driving.You had a better chance at surviving an attack from a grizzly bear while tied in a burlap sack than you had of not sliding into a wall during a high speed chase, cars wobbled more than the double-chins of a portly patron at the all-you-can-eat buffet, road friction would convince you the pavement was made of teflon. Supporters will fanatically defend the new driving mechanics, but I saw it as taking the Auto out of Grand Theft Auto, whenever I needed to get anywhere I'd call a cab.Seems Rockstar realized their mistakes and reverted these issues on GTA V.I played this game a lot, and will probably continue to do so thus this may make me a hypocrite, but I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to a GTA fan who loved the GTA 3 series.P.S. Keep in mind GFWL is kicking the bucket in 2014, and Rockstar hasn't issued any statements regarding updates (which many other developers in the same situation have addressed and resolved), GFWL is latched like a parasite to this game, especially the multiplayer.

												I originally bought this game for the 360 prior to purchasing it months later for the PC. When it first came out, I was sorely disappointed. The amount of ""realism"" in the game is a stark contrast to the more zany antics of the GTAIII series. GTA to me,  was always in a gray line between wacky environments and clever humor intergrated with a serious story. It worked perfectly. While the humor and memorable characters are there, the gameplay itself comes off dull, sluggish, and boring. Many of the features, while interesting at first, eventually start to feel like chores.When the PC port eventually did see a release months later in 2008, it was a complete mess. It was the prime example of a rushed non-optimized console game ported over to the PC. While many of the optimization problems have been fixed, there are still many others that do exist to this day.Modding is another issue. It's severely limited compared to the GTAIII series. Most of this has to do with GFWL (see below), as Microsoft has complete control over almost everything because of the GFWL system.Another issue, and rather the biggest problem, is the DRM love triangle that's been plaguing this game since day one. If you buy it, you have to install GFWL and Rockstar Backstage pass. GFWL was the nail in the coffin for many potential games that came out in the past 7 years  Compared to Steam (even during its hectic years of 2003-06), GFWL service was probably one of the worse and buggiest software clients i have ever installed forcibly on my computer. Thankfully, GFWL is rumored to being shutdown by July 2014, so the possibility of Rockstar bringing the full experience over to Steam is there, be it in a dim light. However the death of GWFL is like the birth of Chinese democracy, or the release of Half Life 2: Episode 3. where the reaction isn't one of cheer and hype, but rather a jester of ""about god damn time"".  The bad news however is that the multiplayer or any online required feature is apparently skewed until further notice as GFWL is cutting down the various services.			"

												Do not buy this game. It is poorly optimized and runs horribly on systems much more powerful than it's recommended requirements. It's also very unstable and will often crash (especially when changing graphical settings). I have reinstalled it three times, and it has given me different problems on each install. On the most recent one, it crashed 2 times, and then hard crashed on it's third time, doing possible damage to my machine. I have since uninstalled it and will not go back.			"

												Normally I dont give reviews, because all players are different and what one player likes, the other doesn't.But this one is special... During installation I had almost every bug and error this game has to offer.First problem: it doesn't use your dedicated video card memory if you have a good video card.Second problem: you have to make an account with rockstar if you want to safe your game.third problem: you have to manually install the latest xbox life market.and last problem: after 3 minutes in game, it asks for your CD key for windows LIVE, I use the CD-key steam gave me and it doesn't accept it.Rockstar knows all this problems but doesn't want to fix this in a patch. Also you need 3 acounts to play this game, thats not very user friendly.After 4 hours trying to repair the bugs I just asked my money back (played it for 20 minutes, 3 minutes in game)Is this a good game? No idea, never had the chance to play it.If you want to fix all these problems, good luck. I just take my money and buy a different game. "

												DO NOT GET THIS!  This game is horrible for PC!  It requires you to log in with your Rockstar Social Club account, Windows Live account AND your xbox account!  I had none of those.  It says you don't need to sign up for single player?  Cool!  Except it's a flat out lie!  So I signed up for Rockstars Social Club since that seemed to be needed.I start playing, the camera does not follow the car, so every turn you make, you have to move your mouse to adjust the view.  Worst possible camera I've ever seen in a game... sigh ok, lets keep going.  Do the intro mission and cutscenes.  Ok the game is asking me to save... 'You must be logged in to save, log in now?'  What?  I already signed up... Ok login again I guess.  NOPE, WINDOWS F-IN LIVE pops up!  Log into that to save?!  WTF!  Okay... raging now, lets do it.  I go to sign up, not only do I need to have a windows live account, I HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR AN XBOX ACCOUNT!  I'VE NEVER OWNED AN XBOX! WTF!  So fine, I create my THIRD ACCOUNT to be able to play.  Finally, go back into the game, enter the log in for the last account.  WINDOWS LIVE NEEDS AN UPDATE!  SAVE YOUR GAME AND RESTART!.... uhhh, go into the game.  MUST LOG IN BEFORE YOU CAN SAVE!

												Before I give my summary, let me go over a few things.YES:  This game has compatibility issues in windows 8 and 10 due to Games for Windows LIVE.YES:  This game requires the command prompt in order to use all that your graphics card has to offer.YES:  You need a number of accounts to run the game online (not a problem for me).NO:  This does not mean that this game sucks.  These faults should not degrade a game completely, especially when there are workarounds to these faults.--GTA IV tells the story of Niko:  a serbian/russian immigrant who meets up with his cousin Roman in the big apple, only to discover that all the glamour his cousin told him:  the women with big ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, the fancy sports cars, the luxury penthouse, turned out to be a lie.  Niko inevitably ends up having to help his cousin through difficult times, discovering that his cousin has issues, as well as ties with known criminals.  As he continues to help his cousin, he delves deeper into the crime life, all while trying to make life work for him and his cousin.Overall, this game has quite a lot to offer even in its somewhat aging state.  You have various story missions.  And you also have hangouts that you can do with Roman and friends (obvious bowling joke here).   You're also faced with choices throughout the game, which may or may not affect how the story goes long-term.If I'm honest, though, there are faults with this game.  I feel that the devs tried too hard to make the driving physics in this game ""real"".  In Liberty City, life is a journy of 3 and 5 point turns.  Braking is squeaky & clunky, made even worse when it rains, but I guess that was expected with driving pieces of utter trash throughout Liberty City.  In fact, the only time you feel like you're actually moving with speed is when you get ahold of a sports car.  As for biking...  well, that's a totally different story that's just as bad.Another fault with the game is that it isn't graphically impressive anymore.  Stacked up against GTA V, this game seems to have followed a trend in 2008 where almost every game was 50 shades of brown, occasionally broken with a blue filter.  Overall, its just not gonna woo people over anymore..--My verdict:  This game has its problems, and it's gonna take some getting used to, but in the end, its worth getting the game up and running for the story it tells.  Its Rockstar doing what it does best.			"

Note: I got the physical copy for this game in winter 2008 for the PC, and have been playing since then.GTA IV, the follow-up to GTA San Andreas. As a kid, I was very excited for this game. It looked amazing, I watched the Trailers over and over again. I was hyped. Was the hype worth it? Hell. Yes. After I got the PC to play it, that is.Gameplay, World and Story:Good:» Shooting feels very impactful and fluid.» Amazing gun choice: Melee, Pistols, SMGs, Shotguns, Machine Guns, Sniper Rifles, Throwables and a Rocket Launcher.» Good AI. Enemies take advantage of cover and pedestrians react realistically to the player's actions.» Exciting police. Shootouts with the police are very fun, they even pathfind into interiors.» Cover system. Cover behind walls, benches, trashcans, cars, etc. just by pressing one button.» Amazing physics engine. Pedestrians and player fall over realistically, it feels impactful.» Good driving physics. Now this point might be a bit controversial, but I personally like how floaty the cars are.» Three different islands to unlock and explore.» Several Story-Choices with varying impact.» Loads of activities you can do with Niko's friends: Bowling, pool, darts, drinking, etc.» You can call your friends for a favor. Want a car bomb? Want to lose your wanted-level? Sure.» Multiplayer is still functional and is very fun.Bad:» Your friends call you up every 5 minutes to ask to do an activity. Not accepting can make your friend deny any services.» No option to do activities (like bowling) with other players in freeroam Multiplayer. Would've been a nice touch.» Open world not as varied and large as San Andreas' world.» There are no planes like in many other GTA-Titles.» Story sets off very slowly.Misc:Settings:There are lots of settings to tweak. Resolution, shadow quality, view-distance, etc. No anti-aliasing option unfortunately, but it can be enabled via driver; Make sure you use something else than MSAA (as it's not supported), like FXAA.Performance:This game does not perform that well. Even on modern PCs it likes to dip into the 30s. Tweaking the settings correctly is important (I recommend turning on Vsync on fast systems, it fixes a lot of stuttering issues).Modding:While not having official mod-support, the game has a HUGE modding-community. There are mods out there that allow you to play as super-heroes or as a police officer. There even is a first person mod (I'd like to think that this mod actually inspired GTA V's official first person).Unfortunately the newest patch broke all script mods. You will have to downpatch your game, or wait for an updated ScriptHook.Summary:Despite the game's flaws and it missing many features compared to it's predecessors, the game improves so much on what the previous titles tried, that it has earned it's place as one of the best GTAs in my opinion. I even think that it feels more fun to play than GTA V. I can only recommend you try it.			"

												This is a nostalgic game for me and I used to enjoy it very much. However, this game falls massively on functionality and performance. It was very badly ported to PC to start off, and since Rockstar never repaired the game after Games for Windows Live shut down, the game is rendered unsavable and Multiplayer cannot be accessed even after the fix (this is not an issue as Rockstar shut down Multiplayer regardless). Also, if you are a fan of dull, flickering textures then this game is for you. Don't forget the unforgivable lag on high-end PC systems.Looking past the appauling amount of technical faults that this game has, I still enjoyed the plot of the game very much, and I think that the variety of things you can do and access is creditable. Just don't expect much content in terms of weapon types, and unlike GTA 5 there are no weapon or car modifications available.To conclude, I think that you're infinitely better off getting this game on console, as you will be able to void the bad performance, glitchy textures and the inability to save without a fix (which you can find on the Steam forums thankfully). I was one of the unfortunate that bought this game only months before the GFWL termination.			"

												This game, despite it being over 5 years old, is still one of the best games that Rockstar has ever made. It has endless replayability thanks to the modding community. The graphics can be made to look at least 10x better than some AAA titles that have come out in 2013. You are able to change the game in such as a way that you can more or less design something that is unique every time you play. Although the game is not without its flaws, game saves are link to one machine and can't be synced thanks to Games for Windows Live, extremely difficult to join a friends game and not end up disconnected and the worst one by far is the ridiculous amount of DRM protection on this game. Although if you remove GFWL you can at least launch the game quicker and save to a much easier to find location, this is also useful if you to play on another computer as you do not have to start the game from scratch. Aside for those, it is still one of my all time favourite games.			"

Everything looks fantastic, but its a lot of shadows in Liberty City, making it tough to see at times of day. There are a ton of keys to use on your keyboard and again it just doesn't feel as fun or easy as previous games. It is still a desirable game, just buy it when it goes even cheaper.			"

RATING7/10GOODGrand Theft Auto IV is a game that revolutionized Grand Theft Auto series in terms of graphics and gameplay features. This is one of my favorite games in series, just because it made a huge difference from the previous games in series, it has great story, excellent characters, Niko is simply amazing, and fits perfectly in everything, cousin Roman and his bowling calls - AMAZING! If you're looking for game and want to spend money but want it to last at least 50-60 hours this one is for you, I didn't finish it on steam just because I finished it before, so that's the reason I got only under 20 hours in-game. So to conclude it's not a perfect classic like GTA San Andreas, nor GTA III but it's really worth playing. Do I recommend this game? Yes, it's worth the money, but I'd really like to recommend you waiting for the sale and get it then, since steam charges a lot for such an old game, yes it's still great to this day but it's little bit too much, so wait for sale.BADNow to the bad side, this game really suffers from opimization issues, you'll get frame drops every once in a while, even the most powerful PC's are struggling from these issues, because it simply won't utilize grahics card power at all, once it does your game is over 100FPS if you have a decent graphics card, but most of the time you'll be stuck around 40-60 FPS which isn't as great as constant 60 or 60-80 FPS, it's not due to PC specs, it's simply due to optimization issues, before it got udpated to 1,0,4,0 back in the day it was even worse, frame drops on Windows Vista and Windows 7 systems were pain in the a$$. So, this is a great game in general, but it lacks from optimization and technical issues.			"

												Well, what can I say? I can't even play the game because of Social Club. Selecting the option to play offline does nothing either. Once you click it, nothing happens. I'm not sure why this is happening. Even launching the game from its local files doesn't work. Apparently, this is a known issue that's existed for a few years now. I wonder why its never been fixed though? I highly recommend against buying GTA IV over Steam. Trust me, it isn't worth losing your money over. Now I know how that feels...*UPDATE 6/1/15*  In order to get the game to work, you need to download the X Liveless mod, which disables the need and use of online functions (Social Club, Windows Live).  However, because Rockstar shut down their servers for GTA IV 2 years ago, that shouldn't be a problem.  My stance on buying the game is unchanged, however.  Players shouldn't have to download third-party content just to get the game to work properly.  If you're looking for a clean, working install of GTA IV, I suggest buying this game separately (from Amazon, etc.).			"

												Stay away from it.You need a Windows Live Account to save and the login process isn't working. Many users are encountering this problem with the current game version / status of Windows Live.No official support or workaround by Rockstar/Valve to solve the issue.			"

												First of all, you may not agree with me or with everyone else who doesn't recommend this game. but not recommended review always try to be honest with everything in the game, not just ""Cousin! let's go bowling"" upvote.let's get started.my laptop spec is 8gigs ram, 2.4GHz i5, NVidia GT520M OC. I can play CS:GO & Dota 2 for 50-70 fps, Tomb Raider for 30-40 fps, and many other at decent graphic and fps. It's old computer, I bought it in 2011.And if you think (and I think too) that ""maybe i can run this game for sure, my sysreq is good for GTA IV"", you're totally wrong. this game is not optimized for PC, and you will have so many issues with this GTA IV PC version.the first of all is graphic issue, if you don't have a powerful machine, my suggestion is to skip this game. you'll have a serious time about setting up graphic, tweaking your pc, defragment, playing with registry and many other files, just for to make this game playable. again, playable, not enjoyable.and like everyone else whining about the 3rd party drm, GFWL, i should too. GFWL will make you even have a hard time just to play this game. - GFWL is not compatible with windows 8.1- and yes, CD KEY Invalid still here, steam isn't behind this, if you have problem with CDKEY you must contact GFWL just to activate it, kinda manually.- I don't know why, but maybe just me. I install my GTA IV at my desktop PC via steam, just like many other games i have. and i can't login to my GFWL account, just for this game. I'm searching this problem on google, said SecureROM is behind this. so apparently, steam will allow you to install game to any computer you have as long as you login with your account. but not with this GFWL, GFWL restrict me to have many ""copies"" of GTA IV at my own computers.- don't make me mention that GFWL is ruining the online gameplay, yes, for now, you can't play online. if you just want to play singleplayer, well its not issues for you.I'm not going to say that it's not worth your money, $29.99 is worthed much for a good game like this. but what i want to say is, it's not worth of your time, to think that i spend money for this game and what i want is just.. simplicity. click install, and play. but not with this game..

												Let me just say, I have played a lot of bad games; I have played a lot of good games. I have never felt compelled to write a review for anything. This game -- I have played it on the ol' Xbox. It was fun. I am a PC gamer though, so I dl'ed this on steam. I have never spent so much time trying to get something to even run in my life. Between the integration with Microsoft's Games for Windows Live and the ♥♥♥♥ box of a port -- this game is totally unrunnable. I have a monster machine (16 gigs of RAM, a nice dual video card setup from NVidia, 6 core i7) and I cannot get past the first few minutes of the game. It freezes and crashes whenever I take any action in game and will work for just long enough to infuriate me into believing I have finally fixed it. Honestly, Rockstar should have payed me to do this because every hour I have logged in this game is just me trying to get it to run. Total crap. Don't buy it.			"

												One of my favorite game right now, i really enjoyed playing this.Even it was soooo long, it wasnt boring, so story was great (only at the end i gets same mission, find someone, kill someone and etc.)Unfortunately, i completed gta4 after gta5 (because my pc was so bad for gta4 and i played gta5 on my old xbox 360).Car physics even better then in gta5 xD.There's one big problem, its GFWL(But i disabled it with patch, and its works fine). Also optimisation is not good, I have 35-60 fps on my gtx 1060, but i think its because my old amd athlon II X4 635 :\(but ofc its was playble). And its in 2017, i can't even imagine what it was in 2008.So my score is 9.5\10.I had glitch, when after i completed this game, one of my dead character called me and we played bowling XD. That means i got ""special"" ending :D "

												Grand Theft Auto IV was released April 29th, 2008.The PC was later released December 2nd that same year.In this game, you play as Niko Bellic.  An eastern European who just recently came to America to stay with his cousin, Roman.  Roman told Niko, via emails, that he is doing very well in America.  Owning mansions, luxury sports cars, and so on.  Shortly after arriving in Liberty City, Niko finds out that most of the things his cousin said about his life in America to be false.You find out Roman actually lives in a small crappy apartment in Hove Beach, which is a small eastern European community in Liberty City.  His cab business also resides there.  Since you (Niko) already went through the effort of coming to America, you decided to help your cousin with his cab business, and help achieve the American dream.This game takes place in Liberty City, a fictional post 9/11 New York City.  Rockstar's take on this is very well done, with iconic buildings able to be seen from the very beginning of the game.  Of course, you can't quite visit those landmarks yet, since the bridges are closed due to a terrorist threat.The city is brought to life with the citizens that reside in it.  With the interactions the player will experience, both in story and in just normal free roaming gameplay, you get that feeling that the city is still in fear of an attack.  With the police blocking off the bridges, to pedestrians overreacting to things and claiming them to be acts of terror.  As well as this games take on Homeland Security, the National Office of Security Enforcement (NOoSE).I recommend this game for its immersive city, story, and lore.  Pick it up, if you haven't already, and enjoy the experience.If you’re a cheapskate and don't want to spend the twenty dollar asking price, wait for a sale.  It usually drops down to about five dollars.			"

												Oh the joys of being a criminal in an open world environment. Grand Theft Auto IV is a game that brings you the engrossing story of Niko Bellic, a Serbian who fought in the Yugoslav Wars. He moved to Liberty City to live with his cousin, Roman, with two goals: revenge and money. This is a game that beat my expectations, as an old GTA fan, in almost every single way. It has a vast amount of things to do compared to its predecessors (i.e. hang out with friends, do many side missions, customize your phone, watch shows/TV, get in-game achievements, etc) contains top notch writing and gameplay mechanics, and an incredibly thrilling multiplayer. Get this game and live the American dream, it's that simple. 9.8/10.0 "

												DO NOT GET THIS SICKISH TIME WAISTING PEACE OF CRAP! I spent all morning trying to get on. When I try to log on to social club my game crashes. I am sick of Rockstar letting people down because of this dumb, idiotic, social club peace of ♥♥♥♥. If I dont get a refund I and my friends will boycott rockstar forever. I will not buy a game for $20 bucks and not get to play it. I would rather play super mario brothers than take up rockstar's peace of crap social club. If you are reading this, dont waist your time with this crap, go to Ubisoft or Activision or something like that. DONT GET THIS PLEASE! You will regret it. This game is good, I used to play it on my 360, but im upset that rockstar has screwed so many people. Max payne, GTA, all of them are ruined and stupid for one reason: Social club. It might work for some people, but the majority of people cant because rockstar just HAD to make a social club when really, no one wants/wanted it. If you dont have this problem, then dont comment saying ""you just have a problem with your computer"". I hope a lot of people read this and decide not to buy it.10/10 rockstar ♥♥♥♥ up			"

It's best Grand Theft Auto but sadly, it's the only one with ♥♥♥♥♥iest port on PC.Another game, same story. One game -sorry- one masterpiece game, it's glorious on consoles -and even PC gamers jeaolus because console have them- and when the time comes, that game released on PC but it have a lot of problems.Oh, also updates are not helping. Lots of players disscuss the ""1.0.4.0"" update gives a better performance and quality. You can downgrade the game and play, i've done it on Windows 7 with no problem but Windows 10 won't allow it somehow.And Good'ol Windows game thingy. No one loves you m8. I can't register game on GFWL because it not allows my key, keep saying same ♥♥♥♥. Hey Bill Gates, Games For Windows Live is a mistake. Just like Windows Vista pal.Some mods can improve performance and quality, it's confirmed by me. I have stable framerates with iCenchanter. Also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ can help me more, it gets rid of GFWL. But the RGSC still stay. It's not too bad, but it's Outdated af.Even after all, i'm still playing after beating game twice. If you can't handle these, you should grab it on a console. It's worth it. It's better then Grand Downgrade Auto V. Really, you can just compare what they have, and GTA IV should win. Even it's has a ♥♥♥♥♥iest port ever.So, last words. If Rockstar gave this game a shot again and make it remastered -it's so popular these days- please remove that GFWL, RGSC Launcher (Not RGSC, the launcher is the one with brain problems) and make a better optimization i can give a full game price again.It's your cousin, lets go bowling.

												As of 25DEC2014, this game no longer works.  For anybody.  It requires Games for Windows Live, and that has been shut down.  Normally we would file a class-action lawsuit against Steam for still selling things like this-- which can't possibly work, and they know it-- but Steam updated the EULA a while back, and you have theoretically signed away your rights to file a class action lawsuit.Unless, of course, you happen to live in the European Union...

												There are so many negative ratings at this game that i must warn everyone who willing to buy GTA 4.The game actually works, if you spend like half an hour to solve the base problems. In my opinion it's worth the effort you have to put into this to make it going. There are many good guides in the game's threads so you can easily solve the problems around the game.I don't really would like to get into details about the game itself, because i think most of you know this masterpiece.So don't get scared by the lots of negative reviews. You can also play multiplayer ONLINE.			"

												When I tried to play this game, I was treated with the Rockstar Social Club sign in. I did and nothing happened. After around a month, I discovered that I needed Games for Windows Live. When I finally found the download for it, I tried to play the game. All I got was an endless loop of character artwork and the main theme of the game. I couldn't even get to the main menu.Buying this game for the PC is like setting a $20 bill on fire.			"

												Worst port I've seen in a game. Seriously. Windows 7 Ultimate, Can run BF4 on 120 FPS smoothly and I cant run this with no mods. 8 Times I have Bluescreened, 3 of them. Not GTA's fault. I had to Defrag my hard drive. I bluescreened. I've spent 3 hours on trying to get the game to work. What happened? I had to run it on windowed mode. Yet it still happened. Instead of that, My taskbar would dissapear and my computer would automatically restart. No, I dont have any viruses on my computer.   After a while I finally got the game to work. Full of pop-ins, more than enough. Constant freezes. So, I thought I would install the reason I wanted to get GTA 4, LCPDFR. Guess what? BLUESCREEN.Wait for GTA 5.			"

												I highly recommend this game! Just... not for the PC.PC problems:-Extremely Unoptimized-Low Framerates up the ♥♥♥-Games for Windows Live required-Full of hackers onlineIf you can look past those problems, then go right ahead and get it! If not, buy the console version.PC Goodies:+Mouse and Keyboard + Controller support+Can connect to Xbox Live (if you care for that)+Mods+Looks way better on PC than the console version (duh)It's an interesting PC version to say the least, not terrible, but sometimes didn't feel worth it. I think GTA IV is a great game, it's just this game shows Rockstar doesn't care about PC gamers (except GTA V).			"

												Most of the reviews I've seen here are possibly coming from idiots who doesn't know how to fix their game.Notably the problems that most people are having right now is about the dreaded Games for Windows Live that Microsoft doesn't really care anymore.You have to put a code in GFWL otherwise not only you can't play Multiplayer but it won't let your save files and whoever came up with that idea is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. What's worse is that many users complained that the code that comes with IV doesn't even work.But that can be easily fixed with the use of a tool called ""Xliveless""; for some reason, Steam censors that word but it's perfectly safe and it allows you to bypass the annoying GFWL Code Authentication/Login.I used a magic trick to make Steam Filters unable to censor that word in case you wondering why it's not replaced with hearts.You can download Xliveless here: Download Link[gtaforums.com]However, if you really want to play GTA IV's official multiplayer mode then I heard that using GTA: Episodes from Liberty City's activation code instead would actually work.Aside from that - GTA IV has been poorly optimised, giving users with low FPS even if you are using an high-end PC.But once you're able to get the game playable then I'm sure you will enjoy this game a lot better than playing on a console since you get to play with mods such as LCPDFR, Simple Native Trainer, Tsunami, ENB/Graphical Enhancements and many more.I recommend this game because it doesn't feel right that this game's User's Reviews score is ""Mixed"" just because so many dumbasses doesn't know how to fix the game.You should buy this game if you have a brain that has a good mindset of fixing things while having a PC that could run this game with more 20-30FPSOtherwise, purchase this game on a console instead.And last thing - here's something that could help you get better performances in this game:I heard that downgrading the game from 1.0.7.0 (the current patch that Steam is using) to 1.0.4.0 would give you more FPS as well as able to get the game compatible with certain mods that are only playable on 1.0.4.0.Just read the instructions here: http://www.gtagaming.com/forums/showthread.php?t=128300Now unfortunately, you can no longer buy this game on Steam currently since it ""ran out of keys for the game"".Could this be our chance? That Rockstar Games/TakeTwo Interactive would fix the issues for the game while stocking more ""keys""?Or will they just let the game ""unbuyable"" since they no longer support it.			"

Dealing with games for windows live, finding a solution for being unable to change the video settings because your gpu is above 2gb vram, and the game itself running awful on modern gpu's. I was never able to hit 60fps on max settings while playing because the game didn't use over 50% of my gpu and cpu.However i was able to put up with all of those issues because the game itself is great. A great world with a great story. The cover based shooting feels a bit stiff and dated now but its still fun and the driving is still good.

Review in English/Spanish 
Análisis en Inglés y Español: English:  Decent game but easily the worst one in the saga (Niko, my cousin!), it’s also a terrible console port. Remember games for windows live? It’s here and it will annoy you to hell. Want more? It's your lucky day because there are other issues with GPUs, OS, etc.  If you are patient enough you'll probably get it running but only after trouble shooting for a couple hours and even after that there is a high possibility it won't run as well as you might like. My game never went past 45fps no matter what graphical settings I played on (mind you, my current rig is more than enough to run GTAV at 60fps with everything on max)I frankly cannot recommend this game unless you want to take your chance as it could run fine or not run at all. Español:  No es mal juego pero es el peor de todos los GTA. La versión de PC se encuentra además muy mal optimizada pues tendrás que lidiar con games for windows live, problemas con sistemas operativos recientes, problemas con la gráfica y un largo etcétera. El rendimiento es muy variable, en mi GTX980 no logre que me diera más de 45-50fps sin importar settings gráficos. Sólo recomendaría comprarlo si por algún motivo no has jugado GTAIV y te pica la curiosidad.			"

												Hey Niko! Let's go bowling! - RomanIs a phrase you will be hearing alot as you play as Niko Bellic, his cousin. Fresh off the boat and wishing to start a new life in America, you will kill, steal and intimidate your way to the top of Liberty City, leaving nothing in your way.Story: The story in Grand Theft Auto IV is very intricate. You start off with basically nothing but the clothes on your back and your cousin Roman, who is a struggling car dealer with lofty ambitions of fast cars, women and lots of money. As you complete each mission, you are greeted with a range of very interesting characters from the weed smoking Little Jacob to the balls to the wall crazy bald-headed Brucie. These characters have great chemistry with Niko and I found myself really wanting to play more to delve into this dark and twisted world. As you play through the game, the missions become more creative, intense and harder culminating in an epic finale. (The main campaign took me around 25 hours to beat).Graphics: For a game released in 2008, the graphics still hold up today if not looking abit murky. The textures are high definition but I often found myself wanting the game to use a brighter colour palette rather the the dark colours Rockstar have used. I guess the game's look is reflective of the dark nature of the story. Sound: All the characters have defining personalities and this is attributed to the superb voice acting. In particular, Niko and Roman's voice actors really sell their characters and give them much needed charisma and presence. The radio stations are great too, with a wide range of music playing and funny radio personalities often talking. The sounds of cars are good though I would have to criticize the fact that most of them sound like vacuums.Gameplay: I haven't played GTA V so I will base the gameplay of GTA IV based on its predecessor San Andreas. The controls are much improved this time round, with a newly implemented cover system that makes gunfights alot easier, accessible and less frustrating this time round. However, I believe that controlling cars and Niko himself have gotten worse this time round, often feeling floaty and imprecise to move about.All in all, Grand Theft Auto IV is a solid game with an enticing story and memorable characters that will not let you put your controller (or keyboard and mouse) down.8/10.

												Pretty simple problem, Grand Theft Auto is a game where you spend more than half of it driving, one can say it is all about driving cars, pick up stuff, run away, follow, win races that is all the game is about and GTA IV was the worse drive experience i have ever had in games, i just cannot put into words how much it is unreal, you cannot make any turn like a normal car, that has got to be the worse GTA ever, and i used to be a fan, if you have to pay more then 10U$ do not do it, you WILL REGREAT, that is for sure.

												I always liked GTA series. But this game pretty much ruined it.First you have to fight with Rockstar Social Club, everytime you launch the game. Then there's Games for Windows Live, that was also obviously put in there only to make life of paying customer miserable. After you get through all this, you'll only discover, that controls react weird, melee combat is absolutely horrible and the way police works sucks too. NPCs are annoying and needy, and obviously have nothing to do, except for annoying you to go play darts with them. The only thing I like about the game so far is story, let's see how long that lasts. But in overall, this game is great example proving that piracy should be legal, because asking 20 bucks for it is almost like stealing.			"

												(All of this can be fixed so don't worry, iam just pointing out how ridiculous this thing really is. So you can still go and buy the game just read this, and if you don't want to go through these problems then consider if you want to really buy the game, or not. Also keep in mind that you will need to create 2 accounts, and i know that it's not that big of a problem, i just wanted to point it out,because i didn't in the review and iam too lazy of fixing it.)This game is not the worst GTA ever created, but the networks arround it are. And i have few things to say about them:No.1: SocialClubWhen i launch the game it opens a social club window where it says that i don't need an account to play singleplayer but when i click play offline nothing happens. So i try to sing up but it says that the email is invalid even tho it's obviusly not (just to clear things up i can sign up to the rockstar page). Eventualy i figured out that you have to click the play button 3 times to proceed (it might be just me, idk).No.2: More bullsh*tSo iam past the bullsh*t that they call the SocialClub and i finnaly get to play. Just that i actualy don't, iam waiting for it to launch and it takes almost forever. So then i decide to open my steam, and what do i see ? that iam not playing it anymore. So i launch it again i click the play button 3 times but still nothing. So finnaly i decide to restart my PC. I start the game up, click 3 times on the play button (yes... again) and this time the game actualy launches. So i'm like ""yay i finnaly get to play the game.""No.3: Settings (not realy)After the game finnaly decided to launch the setting were set to the lowest so i decided to change them to the highest (obviusly), but the problem is: it didn't let me. I was trying to change them but every time i cliked it just changed back immediately. So then i tryed to restart the game... again. clicked the button 3 times (you know how it is by now) and the game launches. And guess what, still can't change the settings.No.4: The wrap upDun't buy this game. Unless you want to spend a lot of time getting it to work (it's pain in the a*s, but it is possible to fix. Which doesn't change my thoughts about it. You shouldn't need to find tutorials on how to install a game is what i mean to say.) And if you want to play older gta (not GTA V) then buy San Andreas, it's right here on steam so i guess that makes it easy.And if you want to buy this game or already bought it here is a guide on how to fix all of the stuff:

Don't worry i know it's for windows 10 but it will work just as good for any windows, you will just have a different layout.I would just like to say that even tho there is a fully working guide that helps you fix all the stuff. There is still the thing that it should not be a problem in the first place and the guide is not even from rockstar it's from a very kind guy which only proves the amount of f*ck rockstar gives. So that is why i don't recomend this game.			"

												8/10Of course, it's a waystone you cannot miss. The most of Rockstars GTA games feels like beginning and the end of all parodies and wannabe sandboxes at one's time. Gameplots, mechanics, subsequential and miscellanious stuff - all sandbox developers imbibes and adopts every sip of that astonishing game series.But, hereafter, with GTA4 you have one-time-through game. Storyline so dense, so alive... and weird for the most of us, that you need only one look at it. Vice City or San Andreas was very different, there was much more fun for returning in game in three-four years after the first time. Even knowing it's teens-oriented, even with all that PS2-level graphics I'm still adore San Andreas most of all Rockstar series...Okay, back to GTA$! Oh, sorry, GTA4, I mean. It's cool. And ""Episodes from LibertyCity"" are cool as well. But... They all are grim. Even horrid sometimes. And the worst part is that you (most of you) don't really like your protagonist. He's proficient, even wised up guy, okay. He had a hard start, that's okay. He's a psycho killer, fine, every main GTA-guy goes like that. But besides all of that... there are big hole with vacuum. It drains emotions out of Nico Bellic, out of any of his companions, activities. It drains YOUR emotions, so you don't know how to get excitement out of this game. One-time goer, for every opportunity in game. No more!Until mods came by, of course. But not for long again. GTA 4 is not a hit, not a brilliant of any kind. And those damned DRM protection you need to work out... Very soon this game will become completely obsolete, comparing to new games. All hails to GTA5, that is!			"

												Although the game is really nice and enjoyable, Rockstar made a partnership with WindowsLive, that just ruined it... You have to download 3 apps for the game to work, not only steam.The windows live game app is always NOT connecting to the internet, even tho we have it. You need have an account on steam+rockstar+lgfw and have them all connected and blablabla. Also, the game itself crashes in inumerous reasons.			"

												This is the best GTA game I have ever played after GTA SA. The story is so immersive that I stopped playing other games. The characters had so much emotions that you would care about every character in the game. Graphics are still good and were the best in 2009 but Rockstar really messed up with the PC port. Game was badly optimized, aiming is difficult because it was made for controllers, glitches, bugs, running poorly on good PCs and the worst thing is Windows Live. I couldn't log in and had to look on the internet to remove in completely because it was so annoying and couldn't let me play the game, also had to install patches to optimize the game and started to get 90fps on high settings. Without Windows Live and bad optimization, this game would be better and most people review this game negatively just because of it. In my opinion, GTA IV has a better story than GTA V... probably the last best story in GTA games, looks like Rockstar stopped caring about singleplayer when GTA V came out.  I don't know if multiplayer is still alive. And people should stop reviewing the game negatively just because of Windows Live... you can remove it and play the game without any problems, well... you will need to install a patch from Rockstar to fix the fps issues but that's not a problem. Worth to buy this game even when it's 20euro on steam.			"

												After playing this game on my xnox 360 it was fun and I had one of the best experiences with a game. Now when I first opened it up I had to download games for windows live and so I did. After opening it and angry with windows live I just skipped those steps. When the game finally loaded I was in a new game. Normal driving Roman to the apartment. So I pressed on the gas on my controller (I was playing with an xbox one controller) and WOW THE LAG. Now I thought this was due to my computer so I kept lowering settings till I got to the minimal. Now my computer can run Skyrim on Medium settings with no lag at all. So I went and read all the reviews for this game and its a normal thing to have a poor frame rate. Also considering buying San Andreas but that game has problems.			"

												COMPLETED DATE22-Dec-2016 SETUPWindows 10 64-Bit, MSI GT80-2QE Notebook, Logitech F710 GamepadRATING (rated as if released in 2016, some aspects may suffer from outdated technology)Optimization : CStorytelling : AGraphics : CSound : AControl : C Fun Factor : BBang For The Buck : Wait for saleI always get mixed feeling after completing GTA games. GTA-series always have great story and comedy, memorable characters, great voice acting, memorable action scenes, and great open world with details here and there. But I never like the combat and driving mechanic. Not to mention if you fail a mission, you have to restart from the beginning, driving the same road, listening the same talk, etc. Rockstar never bothered to change these since the games sold billions anyway and so here we are with GTA4 that have the same awful combat and driving mechanic as the previous games. Overall, this is still a fun game to play. I (Nico) was dating one of the GF, took her to a club, got drunk, driving her home in my yellow Lambo, and instead of getting a ""hot coffee"" from her, I got arrested for DUI instead. Seriously, have you ever been arrested for DUI in a game before? If you haven't, then in this game you can.PS : If you have modern PC with multi-cores CPU, the final story mission are buggy. You have to set the app to run only on 2 cores (resulting in lower FPS) to avoid the bug and able to complete the mission.			"

												Do NOT get this game for PC. It's a fun game, sure, but only when it works. When I first launched the game I was getting massive frame drops. Now that may seem like my problem but I have double maybe triple the system requirements needed to run this game on a decently new computer. So I looked up the issue and found many MANY reports of the same issue. As well as an options menu that didn't help my cause in any way. After hours of testing and removing mods to help fix these issues I have come to the conclusion that this game is almost completely broken on my end and if you got it to work I envy you. This is one of the worst PC ports I have ever come across and by a major developer working on a major title. I don't usually recommend this but if you want this game buy it on console. Otherwise, I advise against buying this game on PC unless you think your computer won't have an issue or that you can fix the issue. I have given up on it but maybe you can do it. Waste of my money.			"

												Most of the reviews for this game seem to have been written shortly after the game came out, or after only playing the first portion of the game. Having finished it, here's my impressions (TLDR: This is about 10% of the game content as you'll find in the two previous GTA games, and most of what is here is tedious and annoying).In the beginning, the game is fun. You drive around a little, and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ old cars you mostly find are hard to drive but that's normal for a GTA game. You unlock some new clothing options early on, and while they seem limited, it feels like the normal tutorial-style starter shop that only has mostly undesirable stuff in it. After a while, your original people stop giving you missions and basically dissapear from the game unless you go do mini games with them.And that's when the game starts to fall apart.Basically, the game seems to want you to do minigame ""dates"" with the women and ""friend hang outs"" with the dudes. You can befriend several characters and do lots of boring, repetitive mini game ♥♥♥♥ with them. Sadly, this is mostly tedious, in large part because the above mentioned part where the cars handle like ♥♥♥♥ never gets fixed. The entire game you'll be fishtailing and losing control of every car you drive, never being able to turn when you need to and overturning when you least want to. You'll fight lots of mobsters, criminals, and cops in this game but the real enemy is the controls. This is compounded by the fact that the controls for moving NIco around often leave him unresponsive at the worst time, like when you are trying to escape a burning car. He will take his sweet ♥♥♥♥ing time. He also likes to lie around on his face and get shot in the back by cops. Eastern Europe has some weird hobbies I guess.This might be forgivable if the main story didn't go off the rails about halfway through, where you spend a while getting to know a pretty interesting clan of criminal Irish (including the sister, Kate, who I'll get to in a second). Things seem to be developing nicely with them, until suddenly you find yourself working for a long string of about 8 Italian randos who blur together to the point that I could not tell you which one was which, or why I was ever working for any of them. Nico constantly talks about needing money, but the best payouts are from the missions you do with the Irish. The italians mostly drag you through a series of increasingly stupid plans, most of which involve walking face first into obvious traps.Added on this, the dialog has no branching or control. You control executions only, and that only infrequently, and the only consequence of your choices (except the last one) is that you can get a generic side mission from people if you spare them.Like the game, this review is costing too much effort, so I'm going to cut the budget and let it devolve into a series of bullet points, instead of putting careful thought into each one and fully developing them.- Kate, the Irish sister, is a ♥♥♥♥ing horrible ""girlfriend."" She puts Nico firmly in the friend box and he refuses to accept this fact, always insisting she's going to turn around. There is one way to turn her around to actually getting serious, but if you go down that road she dies almost instantly in a random attack that you can never get payback for. Oh, and if you don't make the choice where she dies, then you get to watch Roman die. Frankly, she was stringing Nico along the whole time so he'd sooth her lonliness, knowing the whole time that she was playing with his emotions, so I was happy to see her go. Nico is better off with hookers because, ♥♥♥♥, at least they're honest.- Every interesting character from the first part of the game is sidelined in the second part in favor of the blandest bunch of Italian shitbags you'll ever meet. The voice acting for these guys is terrible, they obviously blew the budget on the dudes in the first half of the game.- Unforgivable that the driving is so bad that you'll end up taking taxis to almost every mission just to avoid it.- The developers put a toll booth in the middle of some of the bridges in order to make you stop, pay the toll, then continue on. If you don't do that, you have to shake a 1 star wanted level. Either way, you have annoyance and inconvenience. Also, often missions force you to drive across the bridge over and over again. This isn't challenge, this is padding the game out with pointless and tedious obstacles. It is very much like the endless same road encounter from Far Cry 3.- Nico is basically the errand ♥♥♥♥♥ for every gangster in the city, but never ever rises to any power of his own. At no point is Nico giving orders outside of immediate life or death situations, at which point he's mostly shouting ineffectually for flavor. Sure, you don't take ♥♥♥♥ from people, unless they pay you, in which case you'll suck anything they put in your path.- At one point, Nico is double crossed. The guy who double crosses him then spends the rest of the game cropping up to ♥♥♥♥ with him. At no point do you have the option to track this ♥♥♥♥er down and execute him until the plot finally allows it, WAY later than Nico would have done considering how his character is portrayed. - TLDR: The first two hours of gameplay are worth about $5. Don't pay more than that for this game. Don't bother beating it, read the wikipedia page to get the details on what happens.			"

												The game itself is really good. Had quite a bit of fun. HOWEVER...IT'S AN UNOPTIMIZED PIECE OF CRAP! And it has lots of bugs. It runs at 28 (or less!) FPS at medium settings on my GTX 750 Ti. AT 1360X768! It feels like my old ATI HD 4350 ran this game better than my 750 Ti.Don't get me started on the bugs. My game wouldn't start, it literally closed after the Social Club part. Eventually I had to install a mod that removed GFWL to actually START the game! Also, I got the dual cursor glitch. Seems that this is caused by Steam Overlay.. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, don't buy this game. I literally had a better experience on my PS3 (Only PC game I can say that about..) and on my pirated version of the game on my old PC. The optimization is horrendous and it has a lot of bugs. The game itself is great, but that's not enough to justify buying this game.			"

												Let's jump right on it! Is the game good? Yes, absolutely. Rich story, great voice acting, good graphics and gameplay.Should I recommend it?: No.Why?: Games for Window Live.I saw the negative reviews all pointing that they couldn't play online, frequent crashes, black screens and all thanks to the multiple DRM that this games has. I though, well it probably isn't ""that"" bad. Wrong. It's was worse than that.There are some guides in the steam forums that try to fix this issues but they are all a gamble, maybe it works for a little bit or not at all. What I really hate about this that there is no official support and they keep pushing the sales like it's nothing happening in the back. Bad move RockStar. BAD.Long story short, after massive reading and trying all I could it wasn't enough to run the game properly. And OMG you even need GFWL to save your game locally. Wow!Anyway, stay away or be ready to crack your head in the forums worldwide to be able to run the game properly.			"

												This port is notoriously bad even after the recent update. Bug on the last mission required a workaround to beat the game. The game itself is fun when it works, but poor optimization and bugs hold it back. Has the best story of any GTA game though. Also requires GFWL, which is always a con. Rockstar really ♥♥♥♥ the bed on this port, and it's a shame because the game itself is good.			"

One of the only things I could do to fix the game for myself without using X-L-I-V-E-L-E-S-S (Forums block this word, it is a program to start GTA without windows live) was to download windows live and restart the PC, there are also patches you can find, I cant link them unfortunately but if you look up GTa iv PATCHES/GFWS downloads you should be able to find them!Good luck.

												Ok. This is going to be a totally honest review of this game. I am going to give my opinions after finishing the single player campaign so be weary for spoilers if you haven't got round to playing this game yet. I have alot of history with GTA IV, Firstly it was probably my favourite game of the last generation (Yes I enjoyed it more than 5) and I spent so many hours just messing around in free roam. When I played it on 360 I never really got into the campaign, Basically all I did was mess around so playing the game all the way through on pc was a new experience for me. Lets begin to recall the start of my time playing GTA IV...With this being the PC version of the game, their was obviously some problems to get the game running. Everyone knows at this point that Games for Windows LIVE is a dead service so if you came here for some insane GTA IV multiplayer then sadly this won't be your game (anymore atleast) But I wasnt here for the online feature, I was here to complete the story and enjoy some big american boobs xD. Little did i know the act of starting the game would take a little effort. When you click play it will open a small window advising you to log into the rockstar social club to access some online features, Knowing that GFWS was dead and the fact that I couldn't be bothered to find my social club login, I ignored this and clicked Play (Offline) The window then closed and...Nothing happened. I waited amd waited but GTA IV wouldn't open. I then went on youtube for 5 minutes downloaded a file from a video description, put it in the GTA IV directory and tried again. IT WORKED. Seriously EVERY review you see says something like: ""Don't play cus it don't work."" but I sorted it out in ten seconds on youtube. PLEASE PEOPLE ATLEAST TRY SOMETHING BEFORE REFUNDING! Anyway GFWL stuff aside. Lets get into the game. Niko Bellic (an immigrant from Serbia) is just getting off a boat to meet his cousin Roman who has been living is Liberty city for some time. His cousins drunk so Niko has to drive. STOP! This is the moment when millions of people round the world said: ""What's with the car controls?, Are they sliding on ice?"" DONT WORRY! The driving takes some getting used too but over time you will enjoy it as it really gives a satisfying sense of momentum. So yeah that explains stuff a little. Lets skip foreward so you dont have to hear the games whole story. Blah blah blah Niko wants revenge for someone who betrayed him in the serbian war blah blah blah. When Niko finds the guy to get revenge on you can choose to kill him or spare him. Your choice but I chose spare as roman said it was the right thing to do. Anyway i enjoyed the story. It didn't have the widest variety of missions but it was fun. Some highlights were: Three Leaf Clover and A Dish Served Cold. I chose the revenge ending. (Not spoling too much here) On the revenge ending you get a mission called: ""Out Of Commission"" MAKE SURE YOU READ THIS BEFORE YOU PLAY THIS MISSION!!! This is the final mission and it involves you chasing Pegorino through a ware house killing everyone. Eventually Pegorino makes it to a boat. Niko takes a bike and follows him across the shore. Soon, Roman and Little Jacob turn up in a helicopter to help. Niko then has to hit a ramp on his bike and grab onto the backup helicopter. THIS IS WHERE SOMETHING WENT WRONG. On screen is an instruction to tap SPACE repeatedly to climb onto the helicopter. Tapping space will change the camera angle and won't pull you up. Eventually you fall into the water and fail the mission. You then have to swin to land and replay the mission only to have the same thing happen. The fix is quite complicated and I'm not gonna go into it. All you need to do is search up a tutorial on Youtube. You should eventually find a good one. Because of this problem I had to replay this mission (Quite a long one BTW) about 6 times with no refilling ammo. I was prepared to call my time with GTA IV enjoyable but this bug turned it into a moderate experience. Besides all the bugs and glitches, The game is still very fun and enjoyable to play. I recommend playing the console version for the main story and the PC version for dicking around and mods. Final Verdict 8/10. For crying out loud people do your research to fix common issues, don't just refund the game. Oh sorry I'm getting a call from Roman, I think he wants to go bowling. Gotta go. Thanks for reading.

												GTA IV is a classic game and certainly a fun story. Niko Bellic has the heart of a G and is a likeable character. One of my favourites next to Lara Croft or Agent Blaskowitz. The game works fine on Windows 10 (2016). I am currently logged into both Rockstar and Games For Windows Live. MANY people are having difficulties with this so here is how to do it properly in simple steps:1-	Install GTA IV via steam.2-	Uninstall Games For Windows Live that came with Steam.3-	Download and install Games for Windows Marketplace Client:  http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/Live/PC/DownloadClient4-	Sign in to GFWMP.5-	Create an account and sign in to Rockstar Social Club:  https://socialclub.rockstargames.com/6-	If you are having problems Logging into Social Club make sure you have VERIFIED YOUR EMAIL and also LINKED your Games For Windows Live Account via Rockstar.I repeat: make sure you have VERIFIED YOUR EMAIL and also LINKED your Games For Windows Live Account via Rockstar.

												The PC port isn't that great, but the mods make up for it. If you have it on consoles, i'd advise you stick with it unless you're into mods. It's also under about 3 layers of DRM and runs on 'Games for Windows Live' which isn't great by any stretch of the imagination. With the game itself, it provides hours of gameplay with a pretty good storyline, messing about in Liberty City, and of course the mods. If you can get past all the stupid nonsense that the PC port has, you'll have a blast of a time.			"

												Do not buy this game. However good you expect it to be, there's a tremendous chance it simply won't work. The forums are full of people who've paid money, can't play the game, and get no support from Rockstar. This is bordering on a scam at this point. The DRM is more extreme than any game I've every played. It requires games for windows live, which was a bad idea even before it started to get shut down. It uses securom which is famous as one of the worst bits of DRM anywhere. And on top of that it's not maintaned or supported to even the most basic level. This was the laziest of ports to start with, and it treates its audience, ironically, as potential criminals. Only buy this if you want to give your money away with little to no chance of getting to play the game itself, especially on windows 8.As to the gameplay, compared to the previous game this is a tedious slog. The best cars handle as well or worse than the worst cars in vice city or san andreas. The story itself is grey, depressing, and lackluster. The missions are so poorly done comedian Dara o Brien even does a bit in his stand up show mocking it. The ending, not to spoil it, is miserable. Just give the entire game a miss and pretend it never happened.			"

												Quick Review:Technologically Impressive and thematically impressive, but missing the creamy game center.Long Review:    I'll start this review off by saying that I enjoy the GTA series but I am not a super fan. I have beaten GTA 3, Vice City and San Andreas at different periods in my life all had a profound effect on me. GTA3 absolutely sucked me in, I had not felt so engulfed in a game until I put GTA3 in my PS2 at the tale end of 2001. Vice City introduced me to the 80's, a decade that I was alive during but have few memories of. San Andreas topped them both by introducing a gangland so cal landscape that was the epitome of free roaming gaming .They were all ground breaking ,fun, and even comedic the but sadly , GTA 4 is alot of hype and thats about it.    If you've read any of my reviews you know I'm a stickler for story and I have to say that GTA 4 is pretty weak in this department. While there are some very interesting missions, the over all plot is so loose and bordering on incoherent that it really hurts the game, especially since the same company was telling better stories on older tech.     The story itself is fairly original, for a game anyway ,in that you are an immigrant fresh off the boat looking for the american dream. Initally I thought that the plot was going to be dramatic and a deep look at the United States from the outside. Sadly this concept is tossed aside for a story that relies on over the top neurotic characters that rely on flat comedy and stereotypical archetypes to carve out a thin plot than a deep narrative that makes you question american values. While there are bits of the latter lightly tossed in, its too bad the game didn't do more in this area.     Another area in which the story was under developed, is the number of characters. While main character Niko is very well done, the other characters are too under developed. Roman, your in game cousin is somewhat developed but is annoying and a moron too. Too many characters are introduced , all of whom we know next to nothing about. Little Jacob, a character I enjoyed in the game was vastly under developed. For all the nay sayers out there, taking a person to play a game of billiards IS NOT character development. Technologically the game is outstanding and I think for this reason alone is where a lot of the reviews gave it such high marks. The impression of the real world being translated into video game form is at its apogee here. The best example of this is the feel of the weapons. Blind firing a shot gun into a person has never felt so good, especially seeing them realistically collapse.     While the story is serviceable but lacking and the technology is spot on , the game aspect is where GTA4 hits its largest hurdle. Everyone knows the GTA formula; Steal car, drive to mission giver, complete mission, repeat. GTA 4 is no different but why fix something that isnt broken? The catch here is that you now have a cell phone that also functions as a quest giver, a quick restart button, as well as a complete pain in the ♥♥♥. While I enjoyed the concept of the phone, the date aspect falters because it is not rewarding, its repetitive, and in the end it just didn't do anything for me other than hang up on the person and not care about the thumbs down they gave me. When it comes to The missions themselves, they are usually ruined by the TERRIBLE characters that give them to you. While most people enjoyed the Brucie character I couldn't stand him. He wasn't funny, his missions were boring, and he was a moron.    About half way through the story you realize that most of the missions are the same as the old games. The combat, like Gears of War, is essentially Wack a Mole. The tech is impressive, but why spend so much money on mediocrity? At the end of the day GTA4 will go down as being a technical marvel that lacked a cohesive story and fun,enjoyably game play.			"

												TL;DR: Bad when relased, updated to even worse. Don't buy.I have had a copy of this game from the time it was made. And it didn't run well the with that old computer. I thought that I will give the full version a try with my now much more powerfull computer. Guess what? It still doesn't work, even with all these patches. I actaully remember it running and working better with that old computer!!!First of all, the game doesn't even let me change settings from low, since it is thinking that I don't have enought vram on my 4gt R9 290. So to even make the game work I need to google and use launch settings ""-nomemrestrict -norestrictions"" to be able to make it 1080p. After that I got to the game only to notice that it has huge lag spikes and very noticeable inputlag (even with vsync off). Just that the game is almost unplayable with hardware that is many times more powerfull than anything when it was relased. Tuning down the settings only makes things worse, with even more lagging and handbrake button magically starting to spin the camera. And then we will get to the business with ""Windows Live"". So you new can't even make safes without Live-account? WTF is this ♥♥♥♥? I could make safe on the orginal version without any live crap, so why cannot I now? Just that this game always horribly broken on PC, but the updates have made it even worse. Just don't buy. "

												Nicely done but becomes a little repetitive after a while. There should be more around the story, or more interesting missions than just go and shoot a bunch of people to steal something. Yet, it's addictive and characters are quite developed with clear cut personalities (Little Jacob is AWESOME!).However, after playing for 60 hours, I'm struggling real bad with some missions, after retrying them for like 20 times. No way to skip them, no help, it SUCKS! I'm so fed up to redo the same things again and again and have Nicko not respond to what I ask him to do, ending up dying in the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ways ever. I give up. It ruined my game experience so bad that I now hate the game. Well done Rockstar for not putting any save-points for the long missions and force the player to do the same things during 30 minutes every time, again and again, for nothing.			"

												I don't know where to begin. So I will just say, I have never gotten so much of a thrill from murdering prostiez in dark alleys, then repeatedly stabbing their lifeless cadavers, over and over and over and over and over again, while watching the corpse twitch and flip upon itself, in ways I never thought possible within a video game.Grand Theft Auto IV turned me into a sociopathic, homicidal serial killer.I'm okay with this, as long as it remains a fantasy within a video game, and not become reality.

(""Hours on record"" grossly misrepresented by Steam. We all await the day some decade-old bugs might be fixed on Steam. I'm sure it will happen as soon as a Valve employee is in just the right mood to fix them, sometime after the release of Half Life 3)~Past all the Rocktard, Games For Windows Dead, Steamin' Pile of Turd, and other delightful quirks and wonderful customer support (""What support?! We dun need no stinkin' support!"")...(A while later, after some cups smashed in anger.)~As I said, past all that (""You done yet? Can I play?"" -- 'NO! STOP NAGGING ME! Sorry, you're not helping. I'm doing the best I can, I just need to trick the game into thinking Games for Windows Dead is Games for Windows Live and Rocktards have a Social Life -- I mean Club.')...(A while later still, after some more smashed dishes, this time over my head.)~As I was saying. Once you get past all that, the game can be quite fun...(A while later, after grabbing a couple of mods and fine-tuning them, making sure the frame rate is as it should be --might need an initial dry run, exit, quit, some forced graphics setting in case GTA IV goes full Rocktard and doesn't recognise your card's full potential, relaunch, reload and a quick test-- then making sure the game doesn't crash and the mods work as intended, the new speedometer is not too big, not too small, and in the right spot, the camera isn't looking left or continues on straight into the Hudson when you turn right, etc. My-my, time sure does fly when you're playing GTA IV. Or trying to play GTA IV, initially. By which I mean doing some of the dev's or the devil's work, since Rocktards can't be arsed to do it. Persevere. Don't let the Rocktards grind you down. There. Done. Hopefully.)~So. After you gently mod the living daylights out of the driving physics ('Let's make these cars handle like cars, not beached whales plopped into the middle of a busy intersection') and the POV / FOV, the 'revolutionary' camera angle invented by Rocktard's Most Wasted Employee of the Month ('Bloody hell, what were these muppets inhaling?!')~Where was I... These interruptions trying to make to game run and behave in a civilised manner, as a game released on Steam supposedly should, are becoming annoying.Right. If you sort out this bloody mess successfully -- congratulations, you are now overqualified for any job at Rockstar North, Rockstar Toronto.(NVM though, you can get a job at Overkill. Nope, even more overqualified. UbiSoft Montreal. Nooo, way too overqualified. Well, crap. NVM, you need to work on your ineptitude. 'Must. Screw. Up. More. Often. And. In. Bigger. Ways!'  First, make a novelty 'demotivational poster' using that motto: ""Must screw up more often and in bigger ways!"" Now you're ready to play. 'What? Used up my free time set aside for playing? Bloooody hell! NVM, we'll pick this up tomorrow.')(The following day.)ReviewGame can be fun.End of reviewWHAT!? WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?! The set-up wore me out like a four-hour foreplay, give me a break. I need some of those mythical electrolytes.~""But but but! What makes the game fun, senpai NVM?"" asks little Jenny and Johnny. (What is this, an effing FAQ?)~All right, settle down, 'chirren,' I will give you one simple example. Completely child- and family-friendly.(Maybe not, don't quote me on that, I've never been a model senpai under any name. Tend to chew my charges when I get peckish, then regurgitate fur balls and stuff. Not always as patient as I could be.)~The game teaches wholesome social interaction, the fostering of friendship and intimate relationships with mature pixels, and in general instils a healthy respect for others, along with good family values. (Why are you gasping and spluttering? Jack Thompson's got it wrong.)I'll explain. Using an example. This example grew, like a festering tumour, out of a comment I left on a friend's review. Namely:~""I love how my friends will call me go bowling.""Well, play it some more and it will be the thing you hate most. Needy buggers. And resentful if you say no, say later, or get into trouble and arrive too late.True, you don't need to play the game for that, but so what. Maybe GTA IV was intended to work as a sim in this instance -- The Sims 4: GTA add-on pack. (Called it, you've seen it here first. And that is the true story of why I must hide my true name and identity. Otherwise people would beat my doors down asking for predictions. And for a share of my royalty cheques, 'because we're friends,' supposedly. But I digress).Back to the subject: the cab's not the issue, nor the drive. The frequent calls themselves, which the game can unleash on you, might become an annoyance. The endless stream of nagging, one call after the other sometimes: cousin, friends, girlfriends.Can make you want to stop the car, get out, and just start spraying bullets. Instead, since I'm not a sociopath, I sometimes do go, pick up Roman, take him bowling, let him have his jokes from the Motherland, then once outside, I shove a shotgun in his face and blow his head off...""Your friend has been injured."" I guess so! Next time, think twice, call once, cousin.But that's what keeps the game fun I suppose. You can play it as nest suits your mood, and do the 'no-no,' the unexpected, the socially unacceptable, the irresponsible thing at any time. Things that go against what the game tells you to do, and continue without an ""Oh noes, you injured your cousin! Reload a saved game?""~I left out the best part -- the next part, the follow-up, the 'check-up.' The aggravated assault after the grievous bodily harm inflicted upon your pixellated companion, the aggravated punchline following the punchline.Instead of having to reload the game because you've done something naughty, you can go wreak some havoc, wait for your dear cousin to be patched up after you shot him in the face, and call asking you to pick him up at the hospital when he's discharged.At which point you can decide to be a dutiful cousin, drive to the hospital, stop, get out -- and blow his head off again right in front of the hospital. It's very practical and considerate, what with medical help at hand. Rinse and repeat till he hates you.~Don't worry, he'll still call, he's as slow as he sounds:""Hello cousin! Could you pick me up from the hospital?""'Of course, Roman. I'll be right there, cousin.'*reloads shotgun nonchalantly*This then is the story of Roman as Johnny in 'Johnny Got His Gun.' Always make sure to leave his medulla oblongata intact.~PS.So you don't like this review, and wish to lodge a complaint, do you? Ah well, that hurts my feelings and annoys me. Now you've made me sad. Happy?No worries, I'll find a way to get over it. Tell you what...How about I pick you up and we go out bowling, dear reader?*casually reloads shotgun*			"

												Edited: Updated June 22, 2016If your like me and my friend who came from the PS3 version of GTAIV and wanted an ""upgraded"" version of GTAIV than this is definitely it! Yes, this game is old but its still one of those games we will never stop playing and still have fun with. Being able to play this game in full 1080p 60fps is amazing, (again... coming from the PS3 version) to me and my friend, it felt like a remastered GTAIV experience.Here are some things you should know about this game in order to get it working properly:1. Make sure you do not have Windows Firewall or any Xbox related services disabled (it will prevent you from updating Xbox LIVE)2. If you have trouble logging into Social Club such as the dreaded ""failed log-in"" problem (the prompt of Social Club log-in before the game starts), close the game application and go to:Your drive letter may be different if your downloading games on a seperate HDD, be sure to change the letter to the correct drive letter of your steam games. ---> C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto IV\GTAIVThis is the main directory of the game. locate the Pual.dll file and delete it.Next, follow these steps: (this is a sure way to get the game working, me and my friend has tried this and has worked for the both of us. Credit goes to Codeine_Inferno for coming up with this fix)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Post by Codeine_InfernoFound a fix for Windows 10, not sure if some of you are still trying to play GTA4 but I`ll leave this for anyone else who experienced the problem.!! TIP: If you're a Win 7 user: Try using the same steps while using Compatibility mode for Win XP SP3 instead of Win 7 as menioned below. 1) After installing GTAIV from Steam, download & install Games for Windows Live client from here: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=201134 2) Right-click on the GFLW client installer and go into Properties; make sure its set to run in Compatibility mode for Windows 7. Then proceed with the install. Open GFLW (making sure it runs in Compatibility mode for Windows 7) and check if it atleast lets you login with your LIVE credentials.3) Go in your GTAIV game folder and rename ""paul.dll"" to ""paul.old"" (this will temporarily bypass Social Club login in order to allow you to register your GTA4 on LIVE). Also make sure your ""GTAIV.exe"" is set to Windows 7 Compatibility.4) Start GTAIV the usual way (using LaunchGTAIV.exe), you should be able to get to the main menu. Once in the main menu, click on LIVe. This will hopefully bring down the LIVE dashboard, login with your LIVE account and follow the instructions & allow LIVE to apply updates.5) After LIVE updates itself, exit the game. Now, download the GTAIV game patch from here: http://updates.rockstargames.com/patches/gtaiv/title_update_7_EN.zip Once again, make sure the installer is in Compatibility mode for Windows 7, then proceed.6) The patch should update and create a new ""Paul.dll"" in the GTAIV directory. Attempt to startup GTAIV normally now. If RGSC still refuses to login, follow additional steps. If not, enjoy!7) IF YOUR RGSC STILL DOESN'T LOGIN:Backup your ""Paul.dll"" file, then delete it. Login to Steam-> Library -> right-click on GTAIV -> Local Files -> Verify Integrity of Game Cache. Steam will re-download ""paul.dll"" for you. Launch GTAIV thru ""LaunchGTAIV.exe"" and your RGSC login should now work. 8) The login may not work next time for no specific reason. I got tired at that point and renamed ""paul.dll"" to ""paul.old"". This skipped the RSGC login yet still allowed me to login to LIVE and MP still works (I can create games, yet I haven't found any or tested if my friend can join yet)Let me know if this works for you as well and maybe we can get this to other Win 10 users.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If your having isssues setting the graphics setting on GTAIV, then go on Steam and go to ""Library"" and click on ""Games"". Next, right-click on ""Grand Theft Auto IV"" and select ""Properties"" and on the ""General"" tab, select ""Set Launch Options..."" and paste this line in.-nomemrestrict -norestrictionsThen save the changes. Now launch GTAIV and you should be able to change the graphics settings. Enjoy :)			"

Начинается всё с того, что главный герой иргы – то ли русский, то ли себирский парень Нико Беллик. Приплывает нелегалом не куда-нибудь, а в саму Америку в город Либерти Сити. Корабль уже  подходит к порту.В это время Нико, наслаждаясь живописными панорамными видами пресловутой Америки ведет разговор с одним из пассажиров танкера.В своем разговоре Нико рассказывает про своего преуспевающего кузена, который в свое время тоже иммигрировал в Америку и в настоящий момент смог не плохо раскрутиться: дорогие машины, пентхаус, девочки и все дела.Сойдя на землю Нико встречает его кузен Роман на какой то невзрачной машине среднего класса, что уже наводит на Нико тень сомнений о том, на самом ли деле его брат на столько преуспевающий бизнесмен, каким он себя описывал в письмах для Нико. Попав в квартиру своего кузена у Нико не остается ни капли сомнений и занавес спадает. Как оказалось ни пентхаусов, ни дорогих машин, ни девочек у Романа не было. Жил он в обычной захудалой квартирке в далеко не самом богатом районе Либерти Сити. На почве этого Нико ругается с Романом и высказывает всё, что он о нём думает. Ведь Нико приехал в чужую страну только потому, что рассчитывал на деньги своего кузена. А здесь оказывается, что всего придется добиваться самому..Совсем недавно Нико принимал участия в боевых действиях на какой-то войне. В ходе одного сражения весь его взвод кто то подставил, в результате чего в живых осталось только три человека, один из которых – Нико.Цель приезда Нико в Либерти Сити – найти тех двух оставшихся в живых, которые по слухам могут находиться в Либерти Сити.На счет девочек Роман все же не совсем соврал Нико.Роман хоть и не оказался миллионером, но кузена своего не бросил и по началу подкинул ему не пыльную работенку в своей фирме. Отвези туда, забери того и все в таком роде. Благодаря этой работе Нико постепенно знакомиться с криминальными авторитетами Либерти Сити, один из которых положил глаз на девушку Романа.Нико, в отличие от Романа, человек действия. Поэтому увидев тот беспредел, который чинил тот авторитет с девушкой его родственника, Нико не задумываясь хладнокровно его убивает. Как в дальнейшем оказывается, этот авторитет был лишь пешкой, работающей на куда более серьезных и уважаемых людей, на беседу с которыми в добровольно принудительном порядке в вырубленном состоянии и попал Нико.С этого и закручивается весь сюжет игры.Периодически сюжет игры вас будет ставить перед выбором, кого убивать.Будет у вас в игре и ваша девушка, с которой вы так же сможете посещать все эти увеселительные заведения.Причем от того, как вы себя поведете в игре будет зависеть и концовка ваших отношений с этой девушкой, с которой кстати по мере прохождения игры обязательно получиться пару тройку раз переспать.От того, на сколько опрятно вы одеты во многом зависит как быстро вам даст ваша девушка, обычно это происходит максимум после третьего свидания.Правда секса вам не покажут.Покажут лишь вид квартирки с улицы и дадут послушать соответствующие стоны.Даже есть общественный транспорт, в виде метро, на котором так же можно ездить, правда не за рулем.Случайные прохожие могут затеять друг с другом драку или перестрелку.Предлагается шмалять все с тех же пистолетов, УЗИ, дробовиков, автоматов, в числе которых старый добрый АК-47, снайперских винтовой, гранат, коктейлей молотова и гранатометов.Появилась возможность подбирать с пола камни или кирпичи и швырять их например в витрину магазина, или случайного прохожего.Система боя приобрела приятные новшества.Можно прятаться за углами зданий в процессе стрельбы, перекатываться, кувыркаться и прочее. Все эти действие неминуемо сопровождаются соответствующими поворотами угла обзора камеры, что выглядит весьма впечатляюще.Как и в предыдущих версиях, в GTA4 вы сможете владеть собственными квартирами.Гаражей в квартирах не предусмотрено, зато предусмотрена ваша личная стоятнка у подъезда квартиры, где можно сохранять честно украденные из автосалонов крутейшие иномарки. В квартире имеется телевизор, который можно смотреть.Графика, как и музыка в игре просто отменная.Машины бьются со всех сторон, быстрее всего бьются фары и перестают светить, разбитые капоты открываются и отлетают от сопротивления ветра на скорости.При ДТП вы легко можете вылететь из салона. Моя оценка 9.3/10 Нико Белликов			"

												HOW TO GET GAMING WORKING *Disclaimer this game does not have mulitplayer anymore*1. Go to Youtube, type this in the search bar, ""GTA IV Not Launching Fix (Steam)"" Click the video by Doobie Boy (Shout out to him for the video and the fix link)2. Click the {LINK REMOVED}mediafire.com link and download the zip file I've already done this its not a virus.3. Unzip the file and exteract it to somewhere you can see it.4. Go to your GTA IV folder in your steam folder. (If you don't know how to get to it its. This PC (My Computer) > Windows C: > Program Files (x86) > Steam > steamapps > common > Grand Theft Auto IV > GTAIV)5. Once you're in the GTAIV folder look for a file called ""Paul.dll"" once you find it drag it out and place it on your desktop you shouldn't need it anymore.6. Open the file you downloaded, and drag the two command files into the GTAIV folder, dont drag the readme.txt its not needed. If you have the Episodes from Liberty City Find the the folder called EFLC and do the samething for the regular game.7. Open the game it will take a few seconds to load up. If you have Windows 10 or 8.1 your computer may tell you, you don't have the current version of Windows Live don't listen to that.8. The game should launch and you never had to sign into Social Club or Windows Live.Now the next thing is to fix the resolution, the game by default is 800x600 and the game will not let you change it. Don't worry your pretty faces I got you.1. Go back to your GTAIV folder.2. Look for a application called ""LaunchGTAIV""3. When you find it right click it and hover over ""send to"", then click ""To desktop (shortcut)""4. On your desktop it should by default be called ""LaunchGTAIV -shortcut""5. Right Click it and go to properties.6. There should be 5 tabs on the top of this window, click the shortcut tab.7. There should be a Box called Target where you enter text into. Put this in at the end. BEFORE YOU ENTER THIS IN HIT SPACEBAR ONCE. -norestrictions8. Clicky apply and then ok.9. Launch the game again and go into your options/ settings tab in game, and now you should be able to adjust your graphic settings. Just make sure you don't over do it and kill our computer.-Just as a side note because you are not using the Shortcut steam made, steam can not keep track of your game hours, and Shift + Tab doesn't work, so you'll have to Alt + Tab out to message someone or reply.I really hope this works guys GlHF! :)			"

You will feel exhausted after multiple attempts to work things done. When you feel you handle the Social Club, then the disaster comes with your graphics. No, I mean even if you got the latest GPU, you'll be getting low frame rates, sturdy game engine etc. Please buy yourself a Playstation 3, if you really want to play this game.  "

												Не самая лучше часть Grand Theft Auto которая меня затронула.Всё как-то очень противно, не знаю даже....- Атмсоферы нет совсем как это было в той же San Andreas, даже Grand Theft Auto V имеет свою атмосферу.- Отсутствие природы ( Не понимаю, как они (R*) не могли добавить природу в игру. Ясное дело город, но должен ведь быть и пригород с природой, хотя бы лес какой-нибудь.)- Автомобили получились более чем крутые.- Про оптимизацию вообще молчу, здесь её практически нет.Что ещё сказать. На долго в этой игре вы не задержитесь, если только на момент сюжета и всё.Я лично прошел её 2 раза (2-е концовки) и после начал заходить в неё минут на 15.Оценка игре 5/10.			"

												Hmmm GTA IV. ""GTA IV is a game with a compelling and nonlinear storyline, a game with a great protagonist who you can't help but like, and a game that boasts a plethora of online multiplayer features in addition to its lengthy story mode. It's not without some flaws, but GTA IV is undoubtedly the best Grand Theft Auto yet"" ―Justin Calvert, Gamespot executive editor.That pretty much sums up the whole game. I had a really good experience with GTA IV, and it was very fun to play. I have invested 3-4 hours on this game now, and I do not regret buying this game. At first, Nico (main character) may be slow in movement, and it will be hard to drive cars. Once, you get used to the game, it will really fun to play. There so many missions ta you can choose from (eg. Go bowling with Roman, go on a date with Michelle, go beat up some people for Vlad and do jobs and earn money for Roman).A game that offers this much is a really good buy. I very much suggest buying this game!The only big issue with this game is the DOWNLOAD and RUNNING the game. It was very annoying that when I downloaded it, I couldn't run this game due to a bunch of errors. THIS IS HOW TO SOLVE IT: http://depositfiles.com/files/exnxnkwkj. Download those files, extract them and put ALL of those files into your GTAIV Folder.If you dont know where your GTAIV Folder is, well, its here: OS (Hard Drive) > Program Files(x86) > Steam > SteamApps > Common > Grand Theft Auto IV > GTAIV. Put all those files there and your game will workScore: 9/10 (still has some minor flaws and the download is corrupted)			"

												So i will tell you my opinion..I played all GTA, and i can say GTA 4 is one of the best of GTA serises.. Let me tell you why I have on GTA 4 on CD version about 2,247hours and its still funOne of the best positive is on GTA 4 story mod, missions are very emotional and good, i can say its better story than GTA 5.. The ending of GTA 4 was very emotional with the music..Music is second positive on this game.. Perfect Soundtrack from GTA 4 side, for me its better than GTA 5 soundtrack.. In loading menu its very good theme song and in the missions its too good songs. The MP game can be for someone boring, because you can´t do missions like in gta 5, but you can do another funny things.. Like searching secret car Sultan RS and then just ride around LC with good music on or just camp with your friend in multiplayer somewhere and just shot some helicopters from LCPD or just jump off the Empire State or go visit heart of Liberty City if you know where you can find it..Ok.. you can´t buy clothes in MP like in GTA 5.. but you can do character with your favourite clothes and just tunning it with ranking up.. But the most annoying is on GTA 4 Games for Windows Live... I have always problems with this thing. It ruined the game but you can overlook this epic fail.. Second negative is on this game optimalization.. On some places is the optimalization very awful.. but if you have good computer, you will see just a litle drop of FPS. I played this game on my old computer where i´ve played it on 800x600 all low on 20fps.. so ye.. prob you will run it without problems, but if you have same old pc like i had, you will see the horible optimalization on Liberty City bridge :D So this game maybe dont have so much option like GTA 5 but believe me, i can only recomend you this game.. Comunity is much better than in GTA 5, nobody will kill you here just for fun and nobody will put a reward on your head :D If you will find someone with Trainer, its fun, because they will build a ramp or do a airport party :D not like in gta 5 where cheaters will switch on a godmode and kill other.. no here is fun.. Sorry if you dont agree with me, its just my opinion and you can have your own and sorry for my english.			"

												This is a great GTA, but not as good as San Andreas and V. It has a great story and the characters are original. Gameplay control is fantastic except for vehicle driving which they finally fixed in V. The driving is doable, just more complicated than it should be.My main problem is the back tracking. Copying NY city is a cool idea at first, but it gets boring after a while. NY is basically just dumpy dark color buildings everywhere. But what sucks is having to constantly drive long distances to get somewhere so you can play a mission. Playing a mission is actually playing the game. Driving there is more of nothing. Your not actually playing. It's like driving your kids to school, it is a task, not fun. And it is worse when the mission is hard, and you have to keep driving back to do it again.You can take taxis, but only so often.Otherwise is good old GTA fun, just the previous and sequel are much better.

												Possibly the worst PC port I've ever played. It takes numerous steps just to get the game running, and even when it is running it is hit with a wildly varying framerate and various bugs, several of them game-breaking.The game has a dreadfully slow start, with boring minigames, horrible characters and a tediously drawn-out tutorial - combine that with the performance issues, and there's little incentive to keep playing and see why the game was so acclaimed.

												Let's rewind the date back to March of this year. GTA IV was on sale for 5 bucks and I was curious, as I had only seen it when my friend showed me the game at his house. I nagged my father to allow me to use the funds, and he relented at about 10:00 that Friday night. I bought it and downloaded it overnight (I had a laptop at the time, so it took quite a while).The next morning, I loaded it up for the first time. Immediately as soon as the ship cutscene started, I got graphical glitches and lag, although I attribute that to the laptop, not the game. Besides those technicalities, the game appeared absolutely gorgeous. The graphics (despite me setting every option on low, and despite the glitches) looked stunning to me, as I had never played anything as close to graphical perfection at that point in my gaming career. The dialogue also seemed to be my type of style - clear, sarasctic, and on occasion, angry. And this is just from the opening cut scene!After the cutscene, I gazed upon Liberty City for the first time. Good Lord. For someone who's closest ""open-world"" atmosphere was frigging Delfino Plaza in Super Mario Sunshine, this was like an entirely new path suddenly appeared through the darkened forest of 3rd-party Nintendo games. No longer would basic linear gameplay amuse me as much as the expansive and neverending environment of GTA IV.After staring at what little of the City I could see (with Roman probably anxiously awaiting me to actually drive to his apartment), now I'll talk about the missions. Honestly, I haven't done many of them in my 42 hours of gameplay - only up to the drug dealer house raid (however, the missions do explain aspects of gameplay in a well-scripted manner, and are exceptionally fun). Why haven't I played more of the main story, you probably won't ask but I'll still say the answer anyways? Two words: Free Roam.The ability to do close to whatever I wanted in a gargantuan city with no setbacks (well, the cops maybe, but I just turn them off when I create a game for myself)? It was heaven for me. Most likely over two thirds of my hours in the game are from free roam alone - single player free roam nonetheless. I just found so much to do. Pretend to rob a Burger Shot armed with only grenades before blowing the place to Kingdom Come? Check. Launch off the ramps at the airport then dive out of the car and hope not to die? Check. Jump out of a helicopter and attempt to crush a pedestrian from 500 feet up? Check. The possibilites are endless, at least to me. I could go on and on about my Liberty City exploits, but I'll just leave it there.Of course I have a few minor qualms about the game. Fire kills you way too easily (Stop drop and roll, good lord Niko...), the cops can be absolutely relentless on 3 stars and above, and sometimes the physics just...go away (*coughSwingsetGlitchcoughDon'tHurtMeIEnjoyTheGlitchToocough*).However, despite these few setbacks, I absolutely love this game. Overall, 9.5 out of 10. While waiting for GTA V to come out for PC (if it ever does...), buy GTA IV. Even if it isn't on sale, it is definitely worth the price. As I sit here at 10:07 at night, finishing this review while listening to UFO's phenomenal album ""Phenomenon"" (See what I did there? Oh who am I kidding, you probably did. Ignore me...), I can safely say GTA IV is one of my Top 5 favorite games of all time, putting it amongst the other greats on my Top 5 Games list; Half-Life 2, Luigi's Mansion, Pokemon Fire Red, and Team Fortress 2.Stay frosty.-Silent Scream			"

												Truth be told, GTA IV is the first GTA game I've ever played in depth. I've played other open world crime games like Saints Row and had a lot of fun.  But I found the missions in GTA IV to be repetitive and boring.  Most of the missions I played through involved having to chase somebody down and kill them.  Other missions involve having to kill people in a certain area (and then you'll probably have to chase down the main person you're trying to kill anyway).   Additionally, every enemy is a huge bullet sponge That being said, driving around Liberty City is still fairly fun.  The radio stations in the game have some truly funny commentary.  The guns handle decently well and the cover system works.  The thing that makes me dislike GTA IV is that it is an extremely poor PC port. Textures fade in and out sometimes, FPS slowdowns for no reason (this game is six years old, that shouldn't happen), and the crushing amount of DRM. I thought Ubisoft was bad for making you use UPlay on top of Steam, but GTA IV has four layers of DRM (Steam, Rockstar Social Club, SecuROM, and Games for Windows Live).  I really wanted to like GTA IV, but the bad far outweighed the good.			"

												This one was quite hard to decide on, Whilst the game is indeed gritty and marks a rather jarring change in tone for the GTA franchise that's worth noting whether you like it or not; Unfortunately didn't quite make the grade in technical terms. This definately feels like a PC Port that was pushed out on a very tight schedule, Whilst all the menus may well support mouse movement (something that's sadly lacking from many ports) and the graphics settings scale very well from top to bottom, the actual optimisation for this game is rather poor.In my eyes, a rig running an FX-4130 @ 4.3GHz backed with a GeForce GTX980 struggling to achieve over 24fps doesn't spell lacking hardware, but rather poor optimisation. It's a real shame to admit this but the console versions are a lot more consistent, my minimum frame rate in benchmarks flickered from 13fps to 19fps, no matter how far i tried to scale the settings.In terms of actual gameplay though?It's got a fantastic story of discovery, betrayal, disappointment and sheer gritty(ness) that's worth playing through to the end even with the hardware difficulties, if you're after a great story; buy this. If you're after a smooth, pretty title, avoid this.			"

												Honestly, this is a good game, but only really on console. It it terribly optimized for PC, resulting in relatively poor frames for less powerful computers. Unless you are a really big fan of the series or don't have a console, I wouldn't reccomend it for PC. One thing to consider however is the large mod community, which is really what makes is worth getting for me personally.			"

Grand Theft Auto IV is a third-person open-world adventure shooter. You play as Nico, a East European fresh off the docks of Liberty City, who's coping with the demons of a violent past while making a life for himself in America.Pros: The city looks pretty good and is very open. Walk into multiple stores, apartment blocks and warehouses. The city is divided in islands, making it slightly easier to navigate from one neighborhood to another as you eventually determine you personal favorite routes to each bridge. The city, the characters, television, even the game's internal world wide web reek of sarcasm about the flaws of capitalism, and so does the cliché but nevertheless interesting story. Get involved with gangsters, bikers, russian mafia, corrupt lawmen, and manage your friendship with different people in order to count on them at a later time. Driving is smoother than ever, but mastering it becomes a must soon enough.Cons: The character graphics are already showing their age. The humor is much more subtle and won't get more than a chuckle out of the average player. The subway and train are poor alternatives to stealing the first crappy car you come across, and you'll only ever ride public transport because a mission requires it. Managing friendship also becomes a pain, as you force yourself to stop the action and story to keep your friends level up or risk loosing the service each provide, even permanently lose some of them. With the exception of a few safe houses, you no longer have any purchasable houses or businesses.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!This game isn't perfect, but I'll still recommend it. The city feels alive, you can hear the people on their cells, behind their food carts, yelling and swearing at each other, getting into fights, causing accidents. You can easily immerse yourself in Liberty City, just as long as you are know the plot feels like a 90s crime/cop action flick.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												So I liked this game, even though there are plenty of people that were turned off by the extra realism vs. fun aspect of the game. The PC version is extremely moddable, which makes it even more fun while adding to the replay value. However, it is very poorly optimized and just simply doesn't want to run well. The story was ok, I had the most fun modding the game and going crazy.			"

												An epic game again by Rockstar entertainment. Its like an ""extension"" and an upturn, if I may say, of the previous GTA games, meaning that the game has much better graphics than previous ones and also you can improvise - interact with almost everything on the game (you can use computers, enter various buildings, play various roles etc.) and boy you even got a cell phone!!! Both the storyline and the questline is big and amusing with many missions and many outcomes. The only thing I did not like in this game is the fact that the experience bars, which were used back in GTA: San Adreas (Driving Skill, Stamina, Muscle etc.) were removed and also the way that Police officers react and move (for example: You crush into a traffic light and no attention is paid. Yet you touch their car? They shoot you down!). I mean wtf is this logic. In conclusion it is a good and fun game to play.I give this game 8/10 "

												I love the freedom of roaming the large world of GTA4, driving at speed along scenic roads among skyscrapers, through parks, and along waterfronts. But the missions are just as malicious and hateful as in San Andreas, the mechanics of the game have not advanced at all, and the motion of your avatar in the third-person perspective is as clunky as it always was.I completed San Andreas despite these flaws, but I turned my back on GTA4 after a small number of hours. It just felt like the same flaws wearing a different outfit.			"

												Decent game, steering is done horribly in comparison of other GTA titles, many features and cars from San Andreas don't exist in this (fighter jet, parachute, etc) and the missions are uninspired and repetitive at best. Storyline is not as compelling as some wished me to think. What makes this game a crap pile is the port to PC controls are horrible. The last mission requires you to repeatedly tap 'space' - but this changes the view in the helicopter you're trying to get into, rather than pulling you into it. Changing hotkeys didn't fix this issue, and Rockstar never issued a patch for it.Won't be installing the add-ons I bought, uninstalling. Disappointed.			"

												Yes, the port is downright crapcakes, but the experience definitely makes the 20 minutes worth of trial and error justifiable. Sure, the next game in the series is marginally superior in graphics, controls, mechanics, and a plethora of extra features; although all of those are superior, there's still one feature in the checklist that, despite innovation, the former title pulls off better:Purpose.The pursuit of the ACTUAL American Dream, the harsh struggles of immigrants hoping for more change than there really was to begin with, the limited amounts of opportunities, the grey that encompasses the world, and the trial & error of a broken man, searching for a path forward. Although Michael displayed a similar amount of relatability, Niko remains as the arguably superior character due to his inner search for redemption of past sins, a trait that Michael doesn't display on behalf of not truly regretting his crimes, only wishing to run away and forget about them. Niko is evidenced to of possessed a sincere amount of innocence before the war took effect, whereas Michael has always robbed people since he was first able to, although Niko's childhood situation was proved to be more dire than his due to living in the third world. As such, there is more purpose with Niko as the main character rather than the three GTA V characters of the next game.Also, this is probably more of a personal ""positive"", but fighting wanted levels in GTA 4 seems to be a little more fun in a unique way since I can repair my vehicle extremely fast through the cheat codes on the phone, making fire strikes with the Annihilator gunship more forgiving and interesting. And bowling with the keyboard and mouse is extremely accurate, causing me to easily score multiple turkeys. All in all, the game is not to be underestimated, and proves to be a superior experience on PC after the troubleshooting, provided that the computer hardware is up to snuff.			"

												This game should be renamed DRM IV.You are thinking of purchasing this game for your Steam account - a form of DRM.Then you look at the specifications, oh, it requires SecuRom for activation, fine - DRM.From the launcher, it says you need a Rockstar Social Club account in order to access online multiplayer, right - DRM?In game, it tells you you require a Game for Windows Live account (which links your CD Key to that account and is non-transferrable) in order to save the game - DRM, again.So, you need three seperate accounts, plus SecuROM, in order to access the full content of this game.That is four layers of DRM.Now, the theme.The glorification of gang culture, the objectification of women and sex, and the constant violence, along with the desensitization.Then you look at pop culture and the social unrest along with gun violence in Murica..Chicken or egg?

												Looks like Rockstar and Microsoft have teamed up into making this game unplayable on contemporary machines (the game isn't even 10 years old yet, and it doesn't work on a 2016 system).First it wants you to create an account at Rockstar. Tried to skip it but it wouldn't launch. Registered, but it fails authorization.There's some guide somewhere that tells you to install some odd MS service called Windows Live Games Redistribute or something, and copy some xbox (yes, xbox) related files from WoW64 to System32. For some reason I went with all that, and managed to launch the game but it crashed and messed up the desktop resolution. Last time I saw a crash messing up my desktop was back in Windows 98SE.Now don't get me wrong, 98SE was a great OS - compared to 98 vanilla.After some more messing around I managed to finally launch the game properly. Got into main menu, adjusted settings, clicked Benchmark. Then it says I have to register in order to save my progress.So it's not enough that I'm registered on Steam, and not enough that I'm registered on Rockstar without being able to authorize, now I also have to register at Windows Live Game Redistribute Runtime Environment Service.So I clicked ♥♥♥♥ You instead.It froze. Tried to crash the game, but it completely locked up and I couldn't get a visual on the task manager.By the way, with all that mess Steam says I played the game for 32 minutes.  That includes only the attempts to authorize, attempts to launch, and the time the game spent frozen. Doesn't include all the rest of the time.I'll give it some more effort, and I do hope I will manage to play the game because after playing every PC GTA from 1 to San Andreas I'm sure I'll enjoy this one.Despite that, I wholeheartedly recommend to NOT PAY THEM FOR THIS GAME.Go play GTA 1 and 2 instead, which they actually bothered to rerelease for contemporary machines a few years ago and did a good job at it and even made them freeware.Wow Rockstar. Really ♥♥♥♥ed up this one. And it ain't even the game that is bad, just the wrapper.			"

												This game is finally running on steam as it should with the latest 2016 update that allows it to run on modern PCs. Windows live is still enabled to be used but this is a good thing because achievments are still able to be earned on your Xbox profile. At purchase a few years ago i was really excited to try this game out with mods but the game was really unplayable and was a pain to fix. I never even made it to the actual game because it would go crazy and wouldnt stay at one part of the menu, NOW its all fixed,fully playble and enjoyable. A must buy just like all the previous installments			"

												Absolutley and hopelessly broken for Windows 8.1 x64 users. I've tried everything to make this work, but as it always has for me, it freezes when I press escape to play offline. Dissapointing, Rockstar. Your ports are garbage in the first place, you don't patch them once they've come out, etc. You're one of the most low-down, vile, disgusting, greedy, money-♥♥♥♥♥s in the entire gaming industry, second only to EA. I'm never buying a Rockstar game again, on any system, simply because I refuse to support such rudimentary customer service and overall such disgusting disregard for the customer.

												After 5 years of waiting they finally fixed it, nice one Rockstar - better late than never!If you're still having trouble after updating, try deleting and reinstalling the game and (obviously) get rid of your mods. When I first updated the game it didn't actually work. You will know you're running the updated version if you see Niko on the start menu (instead of  the ""news"" feed).If you can't get the game to start at all, try downloading the GFWL client direct from Xbox.com: http://www.xbox.com/en-gb/Live/PC/DownloadClient Once you've downloaded it, just put in your normal Microsoft account info. and you're good to go.Also, make sure you don't launch the game through Steam. Go to your GTA IV folder and click on ""LaunchGTAIV"". GFWL doesn't play well with Steam, apparently.In any case, for me anyway, the game's pretty much fixed and I don't have to use an old patch or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, so that's a bonus.(My System: i5 6600K + GTX 1070 + game installed on SSD)			"

												Buyer BEWARE! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU USE ANYTHING BEYOND WINDOWS 7!!!I bought this game on disc Waaaayyyy back when I was still running windows 7, around 2011 I believe. Lo and behold, I could not get the game to run on my machine, despite being above spec on recommended hardware. As I got it on clearance I just wrote it off (that and I couldn't return it since the celophane was opened, I simply say ♥♥♥♥ you Wal-Mart). Anyway, I grabbed the game on steam sale (I gave up on physical games a bit ago) one new computer and a new operating system later. It has been nothing but a headache trying to work with this. I've seen backwards-♥♥♥ DRM before, but THIS, this game took the top prize. Signing in to even play single-player, with a website that's never worked since it's inception, graphical tearing on a top-end machine, and a settings file that simply would not listen when they were changed and applied.To wrap up, ♥♥♥♥ YOU ROCKSTAR! Thank you for never removing your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t social club system and making your games impossible to play. If you ever cared about your customer base, which history has shown you don't, recompile and re-release this game as a story expansion or something to GTA V, I may actually buy that one then.Steam Admins, seriously, remove this freakin game from the marketplace. It's an eyesore and a joke. We are laughing at you for keeping this trash on here.			"

												I have updated this review to include the latest patch (December 2016).The story of GTA 4 is incredible! Niko Bellic, who was living in the Yugoslavia and is unfamiliar with huge cities and the american way of life, visits his cousin Roman in the US and suddenly has to face the dirtiest, most criminal and most corrupt city to ever exist. Of course the story evolves out of this setting, driven by an experience Nico had during the Yugoslav Wars and by the decisions that are necessary to make a living. The writing, the protagonists and the art style fit perfectly and create an atmosphere, I have never experienced before. The missions aren't made artificially difficult in any way. If you have to take out a single guy, you can approach or snipe him and shoot him in the face. Done, easy to take a life, no big deal. This greatly contributes to the atmosphere. What makes it difficult are the consequences of your actions. Hell, maybe you even liked the guy.If you have finished the main game, there is the Episodes From Liberty City expansion, which is on par.On the technical side, the game is old and it shows. It was a console port and came with framedrops, no multicore support and several detection issues (1GB+ GPUs for example). To get it to work with WIN 10 and without Windows Live, you had to invest 30 mins. In December 2016 however, Rockstar surprisingly released an update, which fixes those issues.I enjoyed GTA 4 more than GTA 5, because you get to know more. You play a single character, with friends, foes and family. You play in a city that you know by heart and almost feel at home. It's a bit scaled down and I think for good...which doesn't make GTA 5 a bad game by the way.			"

With GTA V out it's obviously obsolete, it also uses GFWL and I'm not sure if they patched it to take away that stupid crap, but if it's on sale for $5 or less I'd consider getting it for the LCPDFR mod (worth Googling), which turns it into a pretty nifty open-world cop game.

												GTA 4 pits you in Liberty City, a corrupted and beautiful city known for it's mob wars, ghetto's, subways, and top-tier pier with the one and only bowling alley. You are Niko Bellic, a Serbian Immigrant who grew up in war and violence and fought in the Bosnian War as a teenager for the Serbian Army. Thus, coming to Liberty City to start a new life with Roman, your cousin, who has an unusual fetish for going bowling with you alot, but nevermind that.Throughout the game, you'll meet a plethora of colorful characters, some who are 2-bit thugs, to mob bosses. Decisions you make through the story will impact your overrall experience with the game and especially the ending. Lot's of betrayals and backstabbings occur in the story, persuading you to be cautious through each mission on what to expect. Expect the Unexpected. Farewell and Goodluck.			"

												*CONTAINS FEW SPOILERS*You maybe think why I have so few hours and I am writing review? Well, the anserw is, I had GTA IV on disc (not in steam some time ago. I got 100% without any cheats (but using guides.) I have no idea where the disc is now, and I deleted all saved games on it to start game from beginning. I want to get 100% again (but its realy hard). So, speaking about game. Most annoying part is making all the ****ing accounts, to play multiplayer and to get achievements. You need to make Xbox account, Microsoft account, Rockstar Social Games account,(not so important, but you cannt play multiplayer) and others. I have RSG account, but I forget my password :D. About CD keys.  know that many illegal gamers steal other gamers CD keys with some programms. Fortunately, my was not stolen. Yet.  Thank God it worked. So have achievements. Well, I buyed GTA complete pack (so together with Episode From Liberty City (GTA IV DLC)) and EFLC didn't even asked me CD key. Strange.So, about storyline.I'm gonna tell it in few words.After finishing the war in eastern Europe, war veteran, named Niko Bellic (I think Serb, his real nationality is unknow) arrived to Liberty City, wich is based on New York. One of the reasons was to see  his rich cousin, Roman Bellic, who wasnt so rich acctualy and lived in some small, dirty apartament (and was gambler). Well, the second reason was to find men, who betrayed 15 people group in the war. Survived only 3 men - Niko, and two of his friends - Florian and Darko. Niko heard that one of them is living in Liberty City. So it's second reason. Living in the Liberety City, Niko finds friends... and a lot, lot of enemies... Missions are very interesting and much - around 90. In some missions you can kill or spare people who you are after to kill, some of the spared people reapears as Random characters (one of the side mission) who then gives you some missions. In games end you have two diffrent endings - Revange and Deal. I both endings one of your close friends gets killed. In each ending, you kill your antagonist. I don't want to tell more about endings.This GTA game, in my opinion, have the best storyline then any other GTA games. Realy, it is.So, about gameplay.Well, I think GTA IV is the most realistic game Rockstar are created. Graphics are very cool and realictic. The map is pretty big. Not bigger then San Andreas (3D san andreas, not GTA 5), but a lot  bigger then GTA 3 Liberty City. There are 4 big islands - Broker/Dukes (the same island), Bohan (not so big) Algonquin (the biggest) and Alderny. Story starts in Broker/Dukes. Bohan is unlocked from beginning, too. You can unlock Algonquin and Alderny doing storylie missions. There are pretty much enterable houses in Libert City. There are a lot of side missions, like chasing enemies with cop car (know as Vigilant in 3D era). There are Taxi Driver, but you dont need to do it for 100% and you can do it only for Roman (because he have cab office). You can get five diffrent friends trought storyline - Roman Bellic , Bruice Kibbutz, Little Jacob, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ McReary, and Dwaine Forge (optional). You can do some acctivities with them, such as playing bowling, pool, go to strip club, go eat, get drunk etc. You can also do these acctivities alone, if you want. Its realy hard to get 100% (maybe because of collectables). Because collectables are 200 pigeons, and you need to find and shot them all.And trust me, this is not all I wanted to say. There are A LOT of things you can do. Buy this game and check by yourself.I will maybe write reviews about other GTA games too, also for GTA 5, when it will be on steam (fall 2014, check if you want), so yeah... THIS IS NOT ALL. I realy recommend this game to anyone.			"

												After half hour of dealing with an evil thing called Windows Live, I got a message that made my blood boil: Can't connect to LIVE. You may be using a Windows Live ID from a region that is not supported by LIVE.... So that means i cannot play online and it was the ONLY reason i bought this game.. I think it is not fair for me and also other people from unsupported countries who bought this game. Steam should AT LEAST put an warning notification for people attempting to buy it.This is the same for GTA IV: EFLC			"

Man I have a ton of games of catch up on, i've already played 14 hours on this one and I wish I had more time to play. Rockstar has really come a long way.

												Grand Theft Auto IV is about a immigrant that goes to new york city to see his cousin roman and makes many new friends and meets many familar faces in the city the city its self is the best part about the game the graphics aren't very good but the gameplay is  rock solid to the shooting to the driving or killing civillans on the street GTA IV doesn't dissipoint the game is just a masterpiece in everyway its just ashame that GTA IV has many problems with the pc port such as heavy preformence issues with even a high end graphics card you may suffer while playing on higher settings but the game is great everything in the city feels alive and real also the modding comunity is just wonderful and that should keep you very busy its easily the best GTA game if not the one of the best open world games of the six generation of consoles highly recommened			"

The game is awesome BUY IT! And yeah for the price of $29.99 you can get gta iv or gta iv and gta iv: Episodes from Liberty city!			"

												I would love to be able to say what a great game this is but I cant as it is unplayable. On purchase you recieve a game key for the game which is invalid. After contacting steam support through numerous messages, they say that they cannot help and I need to look through forums for help and contact  the publisher. This has not yet been solved and with all the problems with Games for Windows Live around, it is looking unlikely to be solved soon.Really disappointed, as Ive wanted to play this game for ages and before starting the newer game.The game should not be for sale while it is unplayable and people who have purchased should be entitled to a refund. I will update this review when (IF) the problem is resolved.			"

												GTA IV is an open world game of the popular franchise released in 2008. The game is set in Liberty City, which is clearly inspired by New York. You play as Nico Bellic, a Serbian who fought in the Yugoslav Wars and is still struggling with his past.+ Good beginning+ Good gunplay+ Some characters are interesting+ You can date some whacky people+ GTA 4 is a long game with a lot of different activities to discover.- I felt that the protagonists lacked depth which could have been solved by good character development. But there wasn't any, sadly.- The final mission is buggy due to being a console port. Some say that using Fraps fixes the issue since it caps the game at a stable 30 FPS rate. I have never tested it though.- Story needed a twist.- Bad radio music with mainly hip hop and rap songs.- Missions consist mostly of driving and killing. The developpers could have been more creative and give us more choices.- You can't fly an airplane. That was even a thing in older games of the same franchise.- GTA 4 requires GFWL and Rockstar social club. If you are not interested into the multiplayer, you can skip the rockstar club registration. It's still annoying though.I'd recommend buying GTA 4 if you are into these games and if its on sale. Still, I feel that they burned themselves with their average story and a lack of any remarkable character development.Replay value: Low-averageRating: 8/10Recommendation: Yes			"

												THE GAME CAN BE DECENTLY FIXED IF YOU DO THE FOLLOWING!!!!!!!!!1) Go to your libary and right click Grand Theft Auto IV (CAN ALSO WORK WITH EFLC) and click properties 2) Click the Local Files tab and click Browse Local Files3) THIS IS IMPORTANT DO THE SAME WITH (gta4Browser.exe , gtaEncoder.exe , GTAIV.exe) Right click one of the .exe and go to properties. Click Compatibility, check ""Run this program in compatibility mode for"" and set it to Windows Vista (Service Pack 2) And do the same steps for the rest of .exe's4) To play online (which might not work all the time) In the files of Grand Theft Auto IV there is a file called paul.dll, just rename it to paul.old. 5) *Optional* A tweak fps mod I personally use, works all the time. http://www.gta4-mods.com/misc/gta-iv---optimizer-fps-boost-2014-zupper-f276626) *Optional* While in game, go to the graphics settings and turn off shadows. This will dramatically increase framerate. Even at low, still turn it off. 7) *Optional* Copy my settings if your graphics card is above GTX 660 or HD 7870 (You can also turn it up to 1080p) I get around 50-60fps in the area. Rarely get dips to 30-40. [

												good game. I have a lot of fun in this game, I think it's a new thing. Than those used in GTA V, so far a better experience is very difficult. You are playing I do not have a game, because it is a simple process to stop the use of rock star in this story, as was the case, I will talk about the history of development "

												2 days ago I would have given this game a negative review because of the Games for Windows Live problem, which WAS a stupid obstacle for those who wanted to play multiplayer GTA IV. But the developers have fixed that problem (FINALLY) and it's fully playable now, so I can give this game what it deserves a big YES. Though nobody plays online anymore because of the problem that doesn't exist anymore... Hopefully some people will come and we will revive this game once again.			"

												*CONTAINS FEW SPOILERS*You maybe think why I have so few hours and I am writing review? Well, the anserw is, I had GTA IV on disc (not in steam some time ago. I got 100% without any cheats (but using guides.) I have no idea where the disc is now, and I deleted all saved games on it to start game from beginning. I want to get 100% again (but its realy hard). So, speaking about game. Most annoying part is making all the ****ing accounts, to play multiplayer and to get achievements. You need to make Xbox account, Microsoft account, Rockstar Social Games account,(not so important, but you cannt play multiplayer) and others. I have RSG account, but I forget my password :D. About CD keys.  know that many illegal gamers steal other gamers CD keys with some programms. Fortunately, my was not stolen. Yet.  Thank God it worked. So have achievements. Well, I buyed GTA complete pack (so together with Episode From Liberty City (GTA IV DLC)) and EFLC didn't even asked me CD key. Strange.So, about storyline.I'm gonna tell it in few words.After finishing the war in eastern Europe, war veteran, named Niko Bellic (I think Serb, his real nationality is unknow) arrived to Liberty City, wich is based on New York. One of the reasons was to see  his rich cousin, Roman Bellic, who wasnt so rich acctualy and lived in some small, dirty apartament (and was gambler). Well, the second reason was to find men, who betrayed 15 people group in the war. Survived only 3 men - Niko, and two of his friends - Florian and Darko. Niko heard that one of them is living in Liberty City. So it's second reason. Living in the Liberety City, Niko finds friends... and a lot, lot of enemies... Missions are very interesting and much - around 90. In some missions you can kill or spare people who you are after to kill, some of the spared people reapears as Random characters (one of the side mission) who then gives you some missions. In games end you have two diffrent endings - Revange and Deal. I both endings one of your close friends gets killed. In each ending, you kill your antagonist. I don't want to tell more about endings.This GTA game, in my opinion, have the best storyline then any other GTA games. Realy, it is.So, about gameplay.Well, I think GTA IV is the most realistic game Rockstar are created. Graphics are very cool and realictic. The map is pretty big. Not bigger then San Andreas (3D san andreas, not GTA 5), but a lot  bigger then GTA 3 Liberty City. There are 4 big islands - Broker/Dukes (the same island), Bohan (not so big) Algonquin (the biggest) and Alderny. Story starts in Broker/Dukes. Bohan is unlocked from beginning, too. You can unlock Algonquin and Alderny doing storylie missions. There are pretty much enterable houses in Libert City. There are a lot of side missions, like chasing enemies with cop car (know as Vigilant in 3D era). There are Taxi Driver, but you dont need to do it for 100% and you can do it only for Roman (because he have cab office). You can get five diffrent friends trought storyline - Roman Bellic , Bruice Kibbutz, Little Jacob, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ McReary, and Dwaine Forge (optional). You can do some acctivities with them, such as playing bowling, pool, go to strip club, go eat, get drunk etc. You can also do these acctivities alone, if you want. Its realy hard to get 100% (maybe because of collectables). Because collectables are 200 pigeons, and you need to find and shot them all.And trust me, this is not all I wanted to say. There are A LOT of things you can do. Buy this game and check by yourself.I will maybe write reviews about other GTA games too, also for GTA 5, when it will be on steam (fall 2014, check if you want), so yeah... THIS IS NOT ALL. I realy recommend this game to anyone.			"

												THE GAME CAN BE DECENTLY FIXED IF YOU DO THE FOLLOWING!!!!!!!!!1) Go to your libary and right click Grand Theft Auto IV (CAN ALSO WORK WITH EFLC) and click properties 2) Click the Local Files tab and click Browse Local Files3) THIS IS IMPORTANT DO THE SAME WITH (gta4Browser.exe , gtaEncoder.exe , GTAIV.exe) Right click one of the .exe and go to properties. Click Compatibility, check ""Run this program in compatibility mode for"" and set it to Windows Vista (Service Pack 2) And do the same steps for the rest of .exe's4) To play online (which might not work all the time) In the files of Grand Theft Auto IV there is a file called paul.dll, just rename it to paul.old. 5) *Optional* A tweak fps mod I personally use, works all the time. http://www.gta4-mods.com/misc/gta-iv---optimizer-fps-boost-2014-zupper-f276626) *Optional* While in game, go to the graphics settings and turn off shadows. This will dramatically increase framerate. Even at low, still turn it off. 7) *Optional* Copy my settings if your graphics card is above GTX 660 or HD 7870 (You can also turn it up to 1080p) I get around 50-60fps in the area. Rarely get dips to 30-40. [

												Yeah,I'm giving it an up.This game,man,this game...This game has got lots of issues,it's hard to even get in the game,that's why I got so many hours,but only like 80 hours were played.A second ago I finished this game,and 100% I mean.I feel so relieved,because it's so hard to do it because of the bugs in this.But I still have to recommend this game,I had fun with it,the story feels great,you even get to chose who to kill and who to let to live,and other decissions and the game even have multiple endings,2 in fact,but still,it's more than one,and believe me,it's a big difference and if you will get to this point,it will hit you emotionally.Get this game,on a sale it's only like 5 euro,and for 5 euro,believe me,you will have lots of problems,but you can get over 100 hours out of this game,and that's a lot.Even if it's got all this bugs,I enjoyed it and I'm going to do some achievements,as much of them as I can,and play some online,I'm going to get more than those 80 hours,because the game is fun,but,I'm going to do a pro/con list.PRO:-The game is gorgeous,and I'm still amazed by the fact that you can get a chopper,get to the top of the sky and see the whole game at the same time,you can even see,barelly,but still,can see the cars moving on the islands and boats and everything,and it looks so good.        -The story is well made,even if you may not feel Niko,but you will feel for the other characters and care about them and you will feel bad if you don't show on a meeting or things like that.And if some of them get killed,man,it's hard.        -Carefull on detail,I mean,when it's thunder,you can even see the people how they get scared,or when it rains,they have umbrelas,and there are lots of other little things that make it great        -It's funny,especially the shows,I found myself laughing like I haven't done in a long time,especially the comedy show.The cabaret may scare you a little        -The girls look good,I mean,you can go into a strip club and while you're going for your private dance,you can see her ♥♥♥♥ shaking while she is walking,man the developers had a lot of fun doing this part of the game :))        -The cars look good,almost every car looks like one you would like to drive,and that's a cool thing        -The drunk camera is great,it shakes so good that I feel drunk myself and I feel sick after,it's really well made        -And there are many other things that you will fall in love with this game if you will try it,and I recomand you to do it.CONS:-The game has lots of troubles,LOTS           -You need a social club account and a Games For Windows Live account before you get to play it           -The social club will say that it doesn't recognizes your details most of the time,or some ♥♥♥♥,that he can't connect,you need to wait like 5 minutes with social club on before pressing the play button,but it's playable           -You will maximum get around 40-50 fps out of this game,and you will encounter framedrops like around 10-20 fps,and it's the game,not the PC,so don't worry,but it sucks           -Your friends will want to go out a lot,they tried to make it more realistic with this,but not every player wants to go out so much with them,but a little secret,you can say you're going and ""cancel plans"" a minute later and they don't get upset anymore (You're welcome)           -The motorbikes are rare in this game,and you won't be able to get back up on the bike a lot when you fall,because,if it falls somewhere where it shakes,the game won't pick it up for you,and you will have to search again for one and you need them for the stunt jumps especially,so it's bag           -Another bad thing,the stealing,you will press the button to steal a car and Niko will start running for the car,but when he is close to it,he will slow down and wait for it to go again and then he starts running again,so the only way to steal a car is by stopping it first,and it's really annoying           -If you're doing the ""most wanted"" thing with police,if you will be too close to the guy,the game will tell you that it updates his profile and it will block there,making you to restart the whole game,waiting again for the social club and all that           -The bowling and pool are bad,I mean,it feels good,you want to play more,but it moves bad,it happened that the bowling ball will hit Niko's leg and it will go out,or the white ball in pool will fly over the table because of the framedrops that are making you to shoot a little harder           -Not many clothes to choose from and most of them are looking bad           -NO CUSTOMIZABLE CARS,this is something that I really felt disappointed about,you only have the paint spray thing,but no customizable           -And there are a lot of problems with the game,things that will stop you from reaching 100%,or not letting you play and from what I've heard,you can't play it on Windows10,and a lot,a lot of other things.Yeah,I know,lots of cons,but I guarantee that you will enjoy this game,buggy as it is,it's something funny about it,it has something good,and for 5 euro on sale,you can at least try it.

												It's crazy to think that Grand Theft Auto IV is now a staggering nine years old but don't let that deter you from trying or revisiting one of the finest open-world games in Rockstar's phenomenal library. It is the first entry into the now present HD GTA universe (moving on from the classic trilogy before it of GTA III, Vice City and San Andreas) and you return to Liberty City in all it's beautiful glory. You play as a Serbian named Niko Bellic who journeys to America in hope of making a better life for himself and meeting up with his cousin Roman who can't seem to stay out of trouble. Without giving too much away for first time players, the storyline is captivating and there are tons of missions and memorable characters along the way. You will join Niko on a road to personal redemption and for the first time you can decide what choices to make (there are even two different endings) The main theme is also so epic and one of the best in GTA history IMO and it really draws you in at the beginning.The combat feels very satisfying and fluid with a range of different weapons at your disposal: melee, rifles, pistols, SMG's, shotguns, throwables, (such as grenades and moltovs) machine guns and a rocket launcher. There is also a new cover system which you will come in handy during intense firefights and is very easy to use at the tap of one button. The A.I. is very realistic, escaping from the police is more of a challenge than in previous titles and the physics engine is a welcomed change (although some players might prefer the feel of the vehicles in the previous GTA titles) Pedestrians and the player will fall over much more realistically in comparison to older titles with the ragdoll like physic system. In terms of size, GTA IV is quite big with three islands for you to unlock and explore. You have numerous activities you can start with your friends by bringing up your phone (bowling, *enter Roman meme here* darts, pool, visiting the strip club, getting something to eat, drinking, etc) Some of these even come with unique favours once they like you enough such as car bombs, weapons, removing your wanted level for you, etc. The multiplayer also still works very well which is a blast.There aren't too many negatives but I guess if I had to pick one, it would be that your friends won't stop calling you at times to hang out and that can get annoying although you can switch your phone to silent but it needs to be enabled to progress the main story missions. There are sadly no planes but you can get helicopters. The map of San Andreas may have been a bit bigger and more varied but you'll find the HD version of Liberty City to be a living, breathing and wondrous place. It's certainly came a long way since the gritty, gloomy feel of Grand Theft Auto III's Liberty City.In conclusion, this is another *must play* Rockstar game. In my opinion, it is my second favourite GTA (narrowly being beaten by Vice City) and Niko Bellic is one of the standout protagonist's in the series history right up there with Tommy Vercetti. I want to add that this game can struggle to run well but if you stick to your recommended settings under the graphics menu you should be fine. If you find your FPS is low, tweak/decrease some of the options there to help out. Mine dipped here and there but for the most part it runs quite smooth and my PC is a pretty good but by no means an amazing gaming rig. You might need a Games for Windows account to play this. I see some are giving negative reviews for that but for me it was no hassle whatsoever. I just linked my XBL and Rockstar Club account and I was away.Just as a heads up, there is a well known bug on the final mission without spoiling anything. I fixed it by going into the graphics menu and making everything the highest it could possibly go and this fixed the problem. I then switched it all back when I got pass that segment of the mission. Hope this helps anyone out there!			"

												Though there are a few annoyances about this game (Requires crappy Games-for-Windows-Live, can be a bit ""buggy"" to get working properly, it's poorly optimized, some particular missions are incredibly / frustratingly difficult to complete, etc...), overall this game (along with the Episodes from Liberty City) has a lot of action (with a mix of shooting and driving), great story, top voice-acting, decent graphics (and the various cut-scenes are well done) a wide selection of in-game music to listen to while driving, mature themes and some bits of humor too, all taking place in a ""belivable"" setting of what feels like a living & breathing city.

												Genuinely a great game. While it may not have an in-depth story or HUGE map like San Andreas, it does polish more of the smaller details within the map, and is definitely worth your time and money. Also, if you have a beefy computer, GET. AN. ENB. It turns an already beautiful game into something that's truely out-of-this-world.  Granted, having to sign in with a Windows Live account is atrocious, especially for playing singleplayer. The controls are very clunky. However, with a plethora of glitches to try out and a HUGE modding community to tweak the game to your liking, it really is something to buy.TL;DR Game's pretty, can easily be made prettier. Clunky controls. Pretty decent story. Hilarious glitches. Best played with friends.8/10			"

												Double thumbs down on this one. First thumb down: the game itself. There is really nothing to recommend it that was not already done, and done better, in previous GTA titles, particularly GTA: San Andreas. To top it off, as is normal with a GTA game, you are forced to play the persona provided by the story rather than getting to craft your own or develop one via in-game choices. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, except that in this case the persona for the main character is pathetic. A dim-witted tool, ready and even anxious to be used by any slightly less dim-witted jerk he meets. That is who you are in this game. Second thumb down: Rockstar. These guys are just too intrusive with their idiotic DRM scheme. In the early days of this game it was just very, very annoying. Why? Because you had to be simultaneously logged into three different authentication methods in order to play, Rockstar's own online system, Windows Live, and Steam. Steam was no issue, they have been reliable since before this game was released. But Windows Live and Rockstar themselves have NEVER been reliable, constantly disconnecting the player, which kicks the player right out of the game. Now, it is even worse. Rockstar have themselves more or less abandoned the game, and this comes after they have placed too many barriers between you and your ability to even play it,  so the fact that they no longer provide any support to help you get over any of these hurdles means they get your money and you get....nothing but a headache and perhaps an ulcer. They are issuing lots and lots of invalid keys, so SecuROM blocks you from getting on; and of course SecuROM is powerless to do anything about because of their contract with Rockstar.  Recent patches have made it difficult for some and impossible for others to even connect to Windows Live, without which, again, the game will not allow you to play. Windows Live itself is plagued with disconnect problems with this particular game, and of course since it is a fault in the game itself, Microsoft provides zero support help to affected players. There is also apparently a huge showstopper of a regression bug in the most recent patch that renders it unplayable for many if not most Windows 10 users. All of this happening right after Rockstar ended ALL support for this game, so if you get hit by any one of these problems and turn to Rockstar for help, prepare to hear lots of crickets...and nothing else. They won't even answer you. Of course neither will SecuROM or Microsoft, since the problems are not their fault and are beyond their power to fix in any case.My recommendation: forget all about this game. And if you disapprove of this business model, you might consider forgetting about any other Rockstar game....ever. I have.			"

												overall game 8/10this port 7/10I loved grand theft auto 4, and it gets even better on pc with mods, however other than that, i can't really recommend this version that much for a couple reasons. 1. This game is very DRM heavy, first you have to set up windows live in order to save, and you need a rockstar social club account to play online. 2. This port was HORRIBLY optimized, even the best gaming pcs have trouble running this game. So if you can deal with these issues, then go ahead and buy it, but if you can't and don't really care for mods, then just stick to the console versions.			"
