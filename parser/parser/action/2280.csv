												Ahhh DOOM... Talk to any gamer who grew up in the 90's and they will surely recount fond memories of all the good times they had playing id Software's original magnum opus. Wolfenstein 3D may have pioneered the First-Person Shooter genre, however it was DOOM that really brought it into the spotlight. Originally released in December of '93, DOOM would later be re-released with an extra episode, re-labled as The Ultimate DOOM. At first glance The Ultimate DOOM may seem a simple affair by today's standards, what with it's deceptively simple gameplay. However looks can be deceiving, as the DOOM series is know for it's twisted mazelike corridors. Gamers who are used to the linear games of today could find themselves lost for hours in a level, searching for the next keycard. In the era that DOOM was released the length of a game was provided by actual gameplay, and not by artificially padding the experience with cutscenes every 3 seconds.The gameplay in DOOM is a satisfying affair in which players must dispatch hoards of hell's minions while searching out colored keycards to unlock the various doors that block their path, all the while searching out the games myriad secrets, which usually results in a serious upgrade of firepower. And you'll need that firepower, as the baddies keep getting bigger and more badass as you go. The best gun in the game, which can be seen below as the player faces off against the Spider Mastermind, is the BFG 9000, AKA the Big Freakin' Gun. It launches a big green ball of energy that will frag the living hell out of anything in it's path.Another thing DOOM popularized was the fine art of Deathmatch. Players could use their brand new dialup modems to engage each other in bloody warfare, where victory was determined by how many times you could reduce your foes to a pile of chunky kibble. Since DOOM's inception of Deathmatch it has become a staple of nearly every game in the FPS genre since. The Ultimate DOOM is truely a genre-defining game, and if you have never tried it you owe it to yourself as an FPS fan to give it a try.			"

												Best anger management therapy that you will find.10/10 Will play forever.All right, since some people found this review 'helpful' I'll try to make it a decent one.Doom is, as you may already know, a very fast-paced FPS with not much story to tell, but with a lot of other things that can, and will appeal people looking for simple but by no means easy gameplay. I recomend this game to any person who likes FPS games. I'll try to cover some points of interest:Graphics: Of course, being this game 22 years old (as of this review) the graphics are really dated for a PC game; having a resolution of 320x200 (IIRC), and 256 colors, you can clearly see 'big' pixels. Even then, the game keeps a good atmosphere for the most part. So if you're picky about graphics, maybe the atmosphere created by the game will keep you sane while playing.Sound: The same as the last point; it's old. Even then, the sounds fit, so enemies growls and scratches evoke a sense of danger around the corner. And the music... oh man, the music fits so well in the game. Fast action along with metal (for the most part) music is a good combination!Gameplay: Now this is the core of this game. This is the reason why I keep coming back to it. Just like the basics of any FPS game, you get a set of weapons, a bunch of enemies and then you empty your shells, cells, batteries, etc. upon them. Doom is just this. There's only you and demons. You have 8 (9 in Doom II) weapons to kill them, and the action is faster than most FPS out there. Walk, strafe, fire, dodge. Of course it's not only a corridor or halls full of enemies you have to dispatch, there are puzzles, with keys (or skulls) and switches or trap floors. It's not only just killing, mind you!Story: The only story you get is the one that came in the manual, but you can find it easily online. But in short; you're a (unnamed) marine, working at the Union Aerospace Corporation in mars, when portals bring out demons from hell and the rest of the people get slaughtered, so it's up to you to stop the demon invasion. How the story is coming along is told in short 'intermision' screens at the end of every chapter.Replay Value: Yes. Just yes. Why else would I keep on coming back to doom if this game didn't have any sort of replay value? And if the game bores you, you have the mods. You won't have enough time in your life to play all the community content that has been created for this game. So look for them! There are a lot of websites with links to these mods!Controls: Now, the native controls of Doom will probably feel uncomfortable for most people nowadays. You can only walk, turn, strafe, use and shoot (and of course run). Strafe is kind of tricky the first time, and you can even move with the mouse (not turn). You can only look to the sides, and shooting an enemy above you is done by autoaim.Try this game with another sourceport that is not Dosbox if you want full support for mods and/or want to change many more options for graphics, sound, and controls (most sourceports makes doom controls more akin to today FPS). There are many different ones for each taste, too.TLDR: Game is astounding, simple gameplay, enough challenge, and you have countless of mods to keep on playing forever, like I do.			"

												20 years later and DOOM is still fun as ♥♥♥♥.You can run real fast unlike in borderlands.Graphics have aged pretty well considering its using an engine from like 1992.You can render a LOT of items / enemies and particles.Very challenging, especially on the highest difficulty. Multiplayer is awesome Base game - probably 100+ hours of replay + has one of the oldest surviving modding communitiesSaid community gives you THOUSANDS of FREE modsat least 100+ more hours of playtime $4.99 (5) ----> 100~1,000 hours of gameplay it sells it's selfoh yeah and this game caused columbine too!So yeah this game's violence and gameplay is enough to overload your brain and make you the agent of satan or some bull ♥♥♥♥ like that.

												The Ultimate Doom is a re-release of the original Doom and features an entirely new episode on top of the three that were previously available. In addition it know supports modern controls of “wasd” and mouse support, though you are still unable to look vertically like in the original. It is the spiritual successor to Wolfenstein 3D and is credited for popularizing the FPS genre. This time around you'll be facing the forces of hell instead of Nazis and their dogs. The tone for this game is much more morbid and disturbing than it's predecessor's endless blue and gray hallways. You'll often times find your fellow space marines dead or still alive and twitching if they are unlucky. Rooms can now be pitch black and you will have to slowly inch yourself forward, toward your objective in fear of being caught by surprise in what may be lurking in the darkness. Without the awesome metal soundtrack blasting in the background, Doom would be pretty unsettling at times.Unlike Wolf 3D this now has floor and ceiling textures, which make for far more immersive environments. But there is no mistaking that these are indeed graphics from 1993 and what may have seemed impressive back then like vertical environments , flickering lights and gore, are typical these days and will no longer impress anyone. Where Doom stands the test of time is in it's gameplay and level design. It's rapid movement and maze like environments to explore are likely to be strange to those that have not experienced an old school FPS, but they do insure ensure fluid, exciting gameplay and replay value as you seek the hidden goodies like extra levels that you didn't find your first time through. There is no iron-sites or reloading here, instead we have an auto-aim feature that will see to it that you hit an enemy if you are facing it, though it does freak out at times when fighting on a vertical plane.Starting off you will be able to choose any of the four episodes to start off with though I highly recommend starting from the first as to allow the game to introduce weapons, enemies and game mechanics. There is no story to keep track of but if you are to start on the later episodes without a firm understanding of the weapons and how to fight demons, you will surely fail. Then you will chose from five difficulty modes that change the type and amount of enemies you will encounter throughout the level. And as soon as you pick one it's straight to the game. No story and no explanation, just you and a pistol. You will soon come across the body of a deceased marine that is facing the door and you will be able to hear a monstrous gurgle beyond the door. Meeting an enemy for the first time is always an epic encounter and you will not have any time to gawk at it. You just have to try to gun it down and hope that strange creatures goes down before you do. It is scenarios like these, that make me highly advise starting on anything other than episode 1 your first time around.Unlike Wolf 3D most enemies are not hit-scan and usually have projectiles that you can avoid if you react fast enough. It makes it feel like a really deadly match of dodge-ball as you zoom across the levels, avoiding multiple projectiles and gunning down all in your path without a single scratch. If you do get hit your characters face shown in the bottom of the screen will get bloodier and bloodier, until the point that he is near death and in tears. This is one of the small details that frightened me as a child, seeing your badass space marine bloody and in tears is something still not seen in many games and reminds you that our hero is indeed human, even if it has no gameplay effect and he still moves faster than Sonic the Hedgehog. If you are injured you will have to find a medkit to restore your health and if you are lucky you may also find some armor to absorb some damage. There are also power-ups hidden across the level like a Berserk orb that causes your fists to cause much more damage for the entire level. Some are necessary to progress though like the Hazmat suit that allows you to walk on lava and other hazards.Thinking outside the box will sometimes be necessary  in your search of the three keycards you will need to escape the level. Like in E4M6 there is a teleporter that will teleport you to different locations depending on which side you step on it, it may seem like a simple puzzle but you have to run across lava to access that tiny teleporter. If you quick-save in certain locations like that, it is possible that you will doom yourself to death if you already used the hazmat suit and don't have enough health to run across that much lava. In that case hopefully you had another save or you will be put on the start of that level with just a pistol. Most of these instances are found in Episode 4 as they tried their hand at some light “platforming”  but with Doom's inability to look up and down, crumby auto-aiming if you are not on the same plane as enemy and lightning fast movement, tiny platforms that you must traverse are quite an annoyance.  It is also the first Episode in which you ever have to use the run key and it overall felt like the weakest link out of all Episodes.Weapons are usually hidden throughout the levels giving you yet another reason to explore areas carefully. These can range from chainguns, rocket launchers and the legendary BFG-9000. You will have to find ammo for them as well and as you can tell by now scavenging for supplies is very important. Ammo backpacks are very will hidden but if you find one they will allow you to carry more ammo at once. The zombie grunts will drop either pistol or shotgun ammo but neither of these will do you much good against the more powerful demons. Demons are very aggressive and this can be used to your advantage. If a demon accidentally hits another demon they will fight to the death and you can use this distraction to either sneak away or to easily take down the victor of that skirmish. They are quite varied and have different methods of attacking, so dealing with each one is requires different method and learning how to identify your largest threat is a must. Confidence can also lead to your downfall, you may think you have taken care of every enemy in the level and spot a powerful gun in the open, only to be ambushed by demons that were hiding. Be it creepy noises, distant groans or evil looking background, this game does a great job at making sure you rarely feel safe.I did have a problem with the Steam version of this game having distorted colors and flickering. I was  able to fix it by following this guide.  With that said, this game should last you around 6 hours but it does have decent replay value and plenty of secrets to find. After each level it tells you the percent of enemies killed, percent of secrets and the time it took you to complete, which may lead you to want to do better. Most levels before Episode 4 have a unique song that plays throughout that further helps differentiate the levels from one another. The environments are mostly brown and gray, so they start to look the same after a while but thanks to excellent level design, no two levels feel the same. If you ever get lost, there is an in game map for each level, though it can be confusing when levels have some verticality to them. While Doom's graphics are now laughable and can be run on most consoles or even your local ATM, it's now extinct form of gameplay is still as fun as ever.  I wouldn't recommend Doom to those that need a plot to drive them forward or to those that hate exploring. Those that don't mind the lack of narrative and want fast, unrelenting gameplay, are more likely than not going to have a heck of a time with this title. While it is starting to show it's age, good old grandpa Doom still has plenty of fight left in him.			"

												Doom is a household name for good reason. It's a game that brought the gaming industry to it's knees and changed the landscape of video games and software forever. Doom resulted in the widespread adoption of the Windows operating system and later the creation of DirectX. Doom popularized the first person shooter, which is now one of the most popular video game genres. It directly lead to custom maps, modifications, source code releases and online multiplayer being a thing.Most importantly, Doom is a symbol. It's a symbol of everything good in video games. It is the product of nights spent computer programming, playing Dungeons and Dragons and wishing fervently to make, ""That game"". That game you fantasize about playing in the back of your mind, that game you think people will judge you for playing, that game that you play 20 years later and find it's still as fresh as the day you bought it.

												Doom: One of the few first person shooters to make you feel smart after mindlessly killing hordes of zombie aliens.When you first start playing doom you are simply given a pistol and a room from which you will start your adventure. Depending on the difficulty you selected, you might face enemies right off the bat, but for the sake of the review I will base my experience on the “I’m too young to die!” difficulty (very-easy in layman’s terms). Playing through the game on such a level allows me to casually stroll through the levels, while appreciating the atmosphere provided.The first level set on Phobos, one of Mars’ moons, where aliens have come through the portals and killed all of your friends. Every single one. You’re the only man left and you’ve made it your duty to take revenge on every last living thing on this moon. You soon find out the scientists working on the moons were working with portals and attempted to link Phobos and Deimos together. One thing lead to another and the events of this game slowly unraveled from there.It’s time to delve into the designs of these levels. These new stages in the game are well thought out, with new weapons before tougher enemies, and secrets that reward you with powerful weapons (Ones that you wouldn’t normally get for a few more levels). Key cards are used to open doors with the corresponding color, and are normally accompanied by health and ammo, because it sure as hell wasn’t easy to get to them. Some maps use dark rooms to set the tone, which work to the games advantage, especially when you’re facing those invisible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s which can take huge chunks of health with one swipe. Some maps use maze like configuration to add a level of difficulty, and you can bet that each dead end is guarded by an enemy. Each level set is finished with a challenging, yet rewarding boss battle. Again, the level design was superb for setting the tone. A long hallway which provided ammo, health, and armor, told me that I was in for a treat when I entered the elevator. For the difficulty I chose, I was given two CyberDemons to face, which were new to me, allowing me to see how they attacked and how much ammo I would be using to kill each one. After defeating the glorified demon at the end of that trek, it truly feels like the levels you played through were just a training match before the final showdown.   To sum it all up, you should really buy this fantastic, innovative game. The enemies are challenging, the boss battles are rewarding, the setting of the game is revolutionary, and the levels are creative and enjoyable. The game has great replay ability, and finding new secrets with each play through enhances the game play even further. For the $5 price tag, you are getting a game that will keep you occupied for hours to come.			"

PrepositionThere once was a time when my daddy gave me my very first own PC. It was huge, grey with a slight touch of yellow because of the cigarettes my daddy and his friends smoked and it had a big screen on the front showing ""120""; the mysterious turbo-button.Life was simple back then. And I grew up with Monkey Island, Lemmings and ... DOOM! It was scary, big and bold, dark and I was afraid playing it alone, so I always went into our PC room, when daddy was there. But holy hell ... I learned to overcome my fear and half a year later I played it on Nightmare.GraphicsSmooth animations, dark and gritty textures, flickering lights an iconic HUD - this was amazing back then and it's amazing nowadays. The gore effects were over the top and explosions were amazing.SoundEvery monster got its own sound, so opening a door, entering pitch black darkness and hearing the brutal roar of a Hellknight was the ultimate method to let my blood freeze. Screaming, explosions and bullets cracking ... it's pure bliss.MusicE1M1. 'Nuff said.

												Dark Souls fans is a game for only the most hardcore gamers who love getting routinely screwed over and by many is considered the hardest game franchise today. To an extent they're right. Dark Souls is a very difficult game that makes every time you've beaten an enemy feel like a small victory. But they haven't played DOOM on nightmare mode and are  surrounded by enemies firing pistols and shotguns at them while demons fling fireballs at them and you're dodging and firing, painfully aware of the fact that you're down to 4 rounds in your shotguns and 15 in your pistol, and your even more painfully aware of the fact that you only have 6% of health left and enemies are constantly teleporting in not giving you the slightest break. Then your shotgun is out of ammo and you're down to your pistol, and then IT'S out of ammo and you just bum rush the nearest enemy with your fists who blows you away with one shotgun blast, forcing you to replay the entire level because you forgot to make a save file and checkpoints aren't even a concept in this game. But the best, most soul crushing, part?That was level one motherf***er. and you've got over 30 levels of this waiting to bend you over and make you call it daddy.			"

												Kids, let me tell you about an ego shooter of yesteryear. One of THE ego shooters of yesteryear, to be precise: DOOM!It may not look like much nowadays, but it's still a fantastic, fast-paced shooter with (rather) open maps, great soundtrack (seriously, I love it!) and lots of hellspawn to take apart!And not only is it still a great game, but it still has an active modding community. If that's not amazing, then I don't know what is!I've played through the game with the Brutal Doom mod, btw., which makes the game EVEN better! Seriously, give it a spin! DO IT NOW!			"

												HOW TO PLAY DOOM ON NEW VERSIONS OF PC JUST ONLY DOWNLOAD ZDOOM GZDOOM : Install your source port of choice into its own folder. Find your DOOM folder in Steam (not sure where it is in Windows 7, but in XP, it would be under Program Files\Valve\Steam\SteamApps\common\). Find DOOM.WAD inside the DOOM folder, and copy or move it to the folder your source port is installed in. You should be able to run DOOM just fine with said source port now. CHANGE NAME OF GZDOOM.EXE TO DOSBOX.EXE AND DELETE THAT OLD DOSBOX.EXE LAUNCH YOUR DOOM AND PLAY :)))) like if i help !			"

												Hi, when this game came out I was just stunned how realistic the graphics are. Well this was back in 1993 when I visited a friend after school and guess what we played DOOM!!! The full registered Version of it ;) *yay* It was just awesome. I guess everyone back in 1993 who had a computer loved that game. The gameplay, the graphics, the monsters, the levels it was just so cool. You really thought hey I am a ""Space Marine"" and I am saving the world up here! :) Nuclear Plant (E1M2) was one of my favorites. Not because John Romero designed it - I played this level over and over again because of the cool soundtrack. Did I mention the sound yet? The sound of the game is just WOW. You never heard such cool music and sound effects in any other game. Never was so scared by these snarling monsters that lurk along the dark corridors where you´ll encounter the remnants of the lost dead space marines that tried to fight these evil forces before... The STEAM Version runs just fine on my system, but I had to edit some files to get it to work properly . If you say yes I wanna give this game a try - just do it it is worth every dollar!! If you need help to get this game working feel free to check out my guide and download my config files @: http://steamcommunity.com/id/crysisheld/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides&appid=2280 "

												***My actual playtime is much, MUCH higher. I play through source ports off of steam, and I play DOOM + DOOM 2 all the time******BTW you don't need windows. You only need the wad file then you can copy that into a source port and play on Mac/Linux***When people tell you about how great DOOM was there may of course be a bit of nostalgia (because they grew up with it), and there are some people who would tell you the game hasn't aged well. Well those people are idiots.I never played DOOM back in it's heyday, I wasn't born yet. My first experience was on the xbox with the Doom 3: BFG edition when I was about 12 or so. I wasn't aware of the legacy behind it either, I just remembered seeing an strategy guide for the game in a thrift store and thinkihg that it had the coolest artwork ever and I kept the name in the back of my head until I would be able to play it. I was mildy irritatted that you couldn't look up or down/jump, but it was still awesome, and I played the ever-loving crap out of it until completed. And this was after I played some more ""modern"" shooters like Halo, ETC, but I still preferred DOOM. Halo was slow and I had to be consistently hiding to regenerate shields. DOOM was fast, fun, and had secrets on every level. I could speedrun through a level, or I could take my time and kill every monster, and look for secrets.And I recently have gotten back into it. It really is one of the best video games ever, and I'm telling you this from the perspective of a 20 year old who grew up with shooters like COD, Halo, and Battlefield, It's not just middle aged people looking back with rose tinted glasses. It really is that good. It's even better now that recent games have to try to be the next COD. You should absolutely buy this game unless you are one of those pretentious whiners who complain if there isn't a cutscene in between every shootout. If you want a good narrative, seriously, go read a book. DOOM has what it needs, and honestly the game benefits from it's lack of plot development. I don't want to sit there and watch some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t narrative about the horrors of war before killing a bunch of dudes.When you go back and play DOOM or any of the other retro FPS games you will pretty much see how far backward the First Person Shooter has gone. The devs, give you a cleverly crafted level, the tools to complete it (but you have to find them!), and say have fun. None of that pointless hunting/crafting, no leveling ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, just you up against the spawn of satan. The sugar-sweet ♥♥♥♥ of heavy ordinance and fun are your only incentives to play. Murder is it's own reward.And perhaps best of all, they weren't tailored to 13 year olds who can't take a challenge and will threaten to have you permabanned from xbox live for headshotting them.On a completely different note the game has a large amount of modders that are still active to this day, and I myself enjoy making maps/modding it.There is literally over 23 YEARS worth of fan made content waiting to be playedBut if you do buy this be sure to grab a source port+ ZDL. Source ports will allow the game to run natively on modern systems and give all sorts of  features+ better control options. I I bought them on steam and just copied the wad files into a source port. Here's a couple of awesome ones. http://gzdoom.drdteam.org/ http://zdoom.org/NewsZDL: http://zdoom.org/wiki/ZDLA resource for modding: http://zdoom.org/wiki/Main_PageSome good Mods/Wads for your pleasure: http://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom/addons/project-brutalityhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/demonsteelehttps://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/s-u/unlovedhttps://www.doomworld.com/vb/wads-mods/87784-ancient-aliens-rc3a-available-aa-tex-v1-available/And also DOOMWORLD for an active community and modding resources http://www.doomworld.com/Have fun!

												One simple word, one simple game, the absolute best FPS on the planet: DOOMStraight out of 1993, Doom was a game made simply because the group of 20 something year olds wanted to make it. It's a game where design splashes with creativity, something you don't find in almost any modern game today. The game is simple. Get to the end of each stage. That's it. You also need to kill the literal thousands of demon hellspawn along the way so don't forget about them either. The monsters range from simple zombie soldiers to demonic goats that shoot rockets at you. The games monsters all revolve around the notion of avoiding projectiles, or hitscans. The maps are designed with absolute love and attention. Each episode was made usually by one person, and you really can feel that distinction when you play them. Some maps were mazes, some maps were collosiums, some maps used more of a certain ammo type, thus limiting your approach, but most of all, the designs of the maps are interesting and fun to play.Doom is a testament to the 90's, and a bit to the 80's. The loud metal induced music, the overall design, the action and horror of films such as Aliens. Everything is combined in such a perfect, uniform way that nothing feels out of place.Doom is in a nutshell, just a game that feels right to play. Not a single aspect about the game feels wrong at all, and thats something you never see anymore in games. The attention to detail and gameplay is absolutely amazing.There is not one single game I've ever played that did everything as perfect as Doom did. The monsters, the maps, the design, the gameplay, the mechanics, the feel, is all so perfect, that you really need this in your library.Being a game from 1993, the game runs on DOSBOX. If you don't like that, there's plenty of source ports out there, like ZDoom, Zandronum (which focuses on multiplayer as well), and for a faithfull recration of the game, Chocolate Doom. There's also literally millions upon millions of custom content for the game as well. Some wads I could reccomend include classics such as Alien Vendetta, Memento Mori 1 and 2, Hell Revealed and some new ones such as Back to Saturn X, Doom the way id Did, Doom 2 the way id Did, ZDoom community map project 1 and 2, and the PSX Total Conversion, and anything by mapper skillsaw (Ancient Aliens is a blast).Doom is a game I will always see myself coming back to, even when we are in 2047 playing games on a display device in our brains.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Brutal Doom Mention: On the topic of this flamboyent mess of a mod, I'll give my honest opinions on it, because as an avid Doomer from the earliest days, I suppose I should explain my self in detail.Brutal Doom is a mod for Doom that throws in absolute rediculous amounts of gore and changes the enemies behavior entirely. Shots deal damage based on location on the body. For example, shooting an imp in the head kills it instantly. You have iron sights on some weapons and you have to reload your clips (this can be turned off with ""mutators"" that can be downloaded individually)Now all of this sounds like the perfect way to modernize Doom right? Wrong. Brutal Doom completely destroys the balance of the original Doom maps, and many pwads as well. For example. you can kill a Baron of Hell in literally 2 shotgun blasts to the head. This completely destroys Episode 1's finale on the Original Doom. The same thing with the Cyberdemon. What used to take a plethra of Rockets now only takes 16-23 rockets. Many of the sub-boss enemies in Doom 2, such as the Arachnotron, Revenant, and Hell Knight, can literally be one shotted with the super shotgun now, which completely breaks the encounters with them and destroys any sense of ammo conservation. The game is extremely annoying. Everytime you kill a monster they scream in agony, which is extremely loud. Blood and gibs fly everywhere, and I mean everywhere, from something as minimal as a pistol shot. It's an annoying audio-visual experience that gives me one ♥♥♥♥♥ of a headache not 4 mins into the game.All of this wouldn't annoy me if people didn't berate the original vanilla Doom experience. Newcomers to Doom most of the time berate amazingly well done wads, like ZDoom community map project, Samsara, etc, simply because they have no Brutal Doom support. This is infuriating to no end, especially since the creator of Brutal Doom is not only a Neo-Nazi sexist racist, but he's also given instructions on how to commit suicide. This is a Phil Fish scenario, and me hating the guy has nothing to do with how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ his mod is. If you ever add me to discuss Doom, don't bring up Brutal Doom. It's not something worth mentioning.]			"

												If you don't know what the hell Doom is, then you are clearly not very familiar with First Person Shooters, or possibly gaming. Doom wasn't any normal First Person Shooter - it was THE FPS. The FPS that increased the potential of 3D game design, what the genre could do and made the genre popular. Wolvenstein may have given birth to the genre, but the genre wouldn't be as popular as it is now if it wasn't for this legendary game. ... but the question is, does it still hold up? Let's get on with the review!!The story is as simple as early 90s games go but there is also a backstory to the player character as well - after our hero has disobeyed orders from a commanding officer to fire upon civilians and decide to stop him instead, he has been sent to work at a military base on Mars, which behaves as a Security post for a Multi-Planetary Conglomerate called the Union Aerospace Corporation (abbreviated UAC). The UAC itself is currently testing teleportation between Mars and it's two moons Phobos and Deimos in secrecy. Nothing special was really happening there... until one day, all hell quite literally breaks loose. The base on Deimos completely disappears off the face of the moon and a frantic distress signal was sent to Mars from Phobos, stating that something... ""evil"" has poured out of the teleportation gateway. Our hero (called Doomguy by the community, seems like a fitting enough name I guess) and several other Marines set out from Mars to Phobos to sort out this problem, and as they land on the Phobos base, Doomguy gets commanded to guard the perimeter, only equipped with a mere pistol, while the rest of the squad set foot inside the base. As our hero waits, he hears radio chatter followed by gunfire and screams which was eventually followed by an eerie silence. Doomguy is the only man in his squad left alive. He loads his gun, opens the entrance door, and sets on through the darkness and prepares for the worst. He hears inhuman cries and wails from the distance. There is no turning back now. He is Doomed... is he?Just a quick heads up: the Steam version of Doom is a DOSbox emulation, so because of this, there will be some things that fans of Modern shooters may need adjusting to. For instance, the controls will be strange to some, as back then there probably wasn't any real support for the mouse - if you move the mouse forward, you walk forward. If you need help trying to adjust to some of the admittedly dated things in this emulation, try checking out the Discussions in Doom's Community section, They will have a ton of solutions, definitely helped me out. But despite having some dated things, once you get the game running how you want it. it will be worth it. OK, let's get to Gameplay. Despite lacking a lot of things that modern shooters have, it does amazingly well without them and very easily makes up for it. You cannot aim up and down due to the fact that there is no Y axis to aim with, but this is very easily made up for with an auto aim that can help hit enemies a floor above or below. Headshots and stuff like that don't exist at all, but the action is so frantic anyway that it would be unnecessary for such a thing to be useful, and besides, the weapons are deadly enough anyway. Oh, and there is no health regen. We don't like that anyway.The level design was incredible back in the day, and it still is very impressive, personally I still think that this game has some of the most well made levels that have ever been made for a FPS, and it makes the more modern shooters out there look amateurish with their linear corridors. Doom's levels are very labyrinthine and dungeonlike - there are loads of routes to take to get from the start to the finish, as well as coloured keys to look for to help progress through certain levels. What's more if you keep a careful eye out, you will find a secret! With it's complex level design, Doom loves to reward players who explore ... which is something more modern games should do really, it makes the game just that bit more immersive and rewarding. And if you ever happen to get lost, don't worry, check the map.The weapons are limited but still pretty effective and are useful depending on what situation you are in. You start off with a measly pistol, but as you get further into the game you will find more devastating tools, such as a shotgun, Rocket Launcher, the franchise's beloved BFG (Quite literally stands for Big F*cking Gun) and even a kick ♥♥♥ Chainsaw! There are powerups as well, such as Invincibility and a Berserk Pack which gives you enhanced unarmed combat. Most of the weapons and powerups are so effective you'd want to save them for when you really need them, sometimes levels require you to use these to progress which makes this game a lot more strategic then some people thought an old shooter could be. Enemy types are varied and hard as nails, and the difficulty curve itself is well paced. They start of simple at first, but as soon as the difficulty curve stars to rise, you will see more threatening types of monsters and more insane situations.  for instance, during the first episode of the game, ""Knee Deep in the Dead"" everything will be very easy for the player. Ammo will be plentiful, enemies will be easy to deal with, facing nothing but zombies, imps and those pink demon things. The end bosses in this episode will be the only possible threat, but other then that, this episode will hold your hand, unless you play carelessly that is. It won't be THAT easy. Beyond the next two episodes, the difficulty will start to pick up, forcing the player to play smart.Then you get to Episode 4, ""Thy Flesh Consumed"".Enemies come in relentless hordes, health and ammo is scarce, there is a threat around every corner, corridors and rooms are incredibly tight, and looking for secrets is vital. This last episode is UNFORGIVING, even on ""Hurt Me Plenty"" difficulty, and it requires the player to put their Doom skills to the test. Either that, or they are doomed.And... if you thought the game was a bit too easy on the last episode on ""Hurt Me Plenty"", then don't worry, Doom has harder difficulty settings, of which will alter the challenge in a couple of ways in the levels, such as harder enemies in certain places.As for Audio, although it uses a dated MIDI format, is really good. The soundtrack ranges from fast paced tracks that suit the fast paced action of the game, and then there are more somber, ominous tracks that suit Doom's gothic style. Weapons sound great, the chainsaw for instance sounds as grisly as a chainsaw should be. Monsters sound excellent and the kind of noises they make differ from each type, which can help the player develop a twitch reaction on how to deal with them if they bump into them (eg: Was that an Imp? I'll get my shotgun out...).Graphics... Ehh. Alright they are horribly dated but there seems to be a gothic style going on here. and not all the levels look the same. Plus each enemy type has a distinct silhouette which can also help develop a twitch reaction on what the player should do to deal with them. Doom isn't an amazing looking game, but it's still not a bad looking one.I think I described enough of Doom now, now to answer the question I said at the start of this review: Does Doom still hold up?In two words: Hell yes. Doom was not only a revolution in the game industry, but it is a achievement in solid game design. while it may have aged poorly in the graphics department and it may lacks some thing most other modern shooters can do, everything else it can do, it does it FLAWLESSLY. The game brought several things to the table back then and it can still do them again and impress. If you haven't played Doom, then for the love of god, DO SO.  Doom is a truly unmissable classic. So, what are you doing? Buy it. Lock, load, rev up that chainsaw, and get ready to rip and tear. Bring on the Ultravionce!!			"

You are doom guy, you kill the ♥♥♥♥ out of demons and collect keycards to get further in the level until you reach the exit of that level. Sometimes you fight bosses. You get progressively more awesome and powerful weapons as you progress through the game and face increasingly difficult and awesome enemies as you go on. Its simple, but pure, Again like Tetris.

												Just got this game, I didn't grow up in the 90's, most of my fps gaming experience doesn't go far from Halo or CoD and let me tell you, this game is amazing, I am more involved in this game just 10 minutes in than I have been in almost any other game with up-to-date gaming mechanics, however, I do have to make a complaint about the controls, using my mouse to try to look to the left and I end up moving backwards can get annoying after a while, but other than that, this game is much more than worth the $5.00			"

												I remember vaguely my brother playing this game when I was real young (and by real young around 5-7 years old XD), and that is the majority of the reason I got this game. I wanted to experience what he experienced as a gamer and I always liked watching him playing video games(except I couldn't watch this one because it was so gorey, but managed to peek many times). To me, this is the birth of the FPS genre and it's great to see how much it has evolved over the years. It's also great to be able to go back into the past to play this game. I love how there are a variety of difficulties, from those who are very newbish to the very hardcore gamer. This is an arcade-like game where you just gotta kill everything around you and pass the level. Secrets? Optional. Simplicity? Yes. A gem in time that will always live on? Very, very likely.			"

												Rip and tear into this action classic that hasn't only just stood the test of time but has surpassed it. With a still active community on the Doomworld forums where mappers to this day continue to develop 32 level megawads for good old fashioned classic vanilla doom. On top of that modern limit removing sourceports allow for doom to be played at 1080P with mouse support and the steam overlay while still tracking hours played on your profile (holy mackerel!). The four original id designed episodes for Ultimate Doom play amazingly well and even better than the campaign that Doom II was released with despite Doom II adding some incredibly fun monsters and the game changing weapon that is the Super Shotgun. Thy Flesh Consumed is in my opinion the best episode and it contains my favorite map: E4M2: Perfect Hatred. After completing the first Doom be sure to run through Doom II!How to run modern sourceports through steam:

												The game is great, without any doubt. The amount of hours I wasted in my childhood playing DOOM games is absolutely insane and would be enough for a second life. So the game is a rock solid 10 out of 10, no questions asked. And if you have not played it yet, DO IT!But not this Steam version, which is kind of unplayable due to bad pre-configuration or the fact that Steam, otherwise than GOG, just throws old games like these barely playable on the market.Tip: Google and install GZDoom, ZDoom or any other source port, copy the *.wad files from your Steam installation to that folder, add some BrutalDoom / Project Brutality mod to it and you're good to go.This way you'll probably waaaay more fun, believe me :)Edit: I've seen that the first two DOOMs are now available on GOG (Good Old Games). I bought them there (because I hate DRM as much as I love GOG) and guess what? They run. I installed the first two DOOMs and they just work like they should. That's the reason why Steam isn't really the best adress for old games like these ones. They don't try to polish them (in terms of ""make them playable"") or try to uphold the functionality like GOG does. Besides that, they are always overpriced. GOG = <3			"

												Ah, Doom. I'm such a big fan of this Hellish series, I've been playing for years already. And It never gets old. Doom Is one of my most favorite games of all time, I'm not a big fan of Doom 2 though. I'm just too use to this classic here. You play as a Space Marine or Doomguy, as you run and gun your way out of Hellish Demons and Zombies. A classic game from 1993, Doom was one of the goriest games In It's time. And you would headbang to the heavy metal music while gunning down Zombiemen and Imps. This version here Is The Uiltmate Doom, where It Includes a new fourth episode titled Thy Flesh Consumed. Episodes:Knee-Deep In The Dead: This Is my favorite, well. I'm sure It's everybody's favorite. This Is where It all begins, the Hellish rampage starts.The Shores of Hell: My least favorite, this took me a while to complete. But I know my ways through this episode.Inferno: The final episode, and the best out of all the episodes, Is where you finally confront The Spider-Mastermind. And This Is my most favorite episode.Thy Flesh Consumed: I've not played this one yet, but I'll give It a try one of these days.I highly recommend this game to new and old school gamers, or for those who never played FPS before. I completely rate this classic a 10/10. I know It's overated folks, but a game like Doom deserves It. For making the FPS Genre so popular today.			"

												Surprisingly holds up more than 2 decades later. Sort of. You'll need GZDoom in order to play it, otherwise you're dealing with an old DOS program that runs at 100x100 resolution with no widescreen support and no mouse support. But those are issues with age that are expected of a game rather than outright compatibility issues that modern games suffer from; no one expects a 20 year old DOS game to not be a 20 year old DOS game. GZDoom is so easy to set up that it's no issue at all.Overrated? I think so. Still good? Yes. It's the maps. They're good. They're complex and have a lot of secret areas around, with enemies frequently popping out of corridors and walls. It's part exploration as you traverse the map looking for keycards and exploring the new area you've been plopped into. But it's also done fast as you move at the speed of light, so it doesn't *feel* like a slow trek across a large area checking everything out. and that's it, really. This game's design was such that emphasis was placed on maps and their design. After all, what is Doom and WAD's but just map design, because there's no real story or complicated mechanics to weaponry or boss battles. The lifespan of this game and it's continual development has been based on WAD's and just making more maps, period. Because it's shooting isn't spectacular; the game has auto aim by default and height differences aren't taken into account. The boss battles are meh, and the weapons are nice and all but there's no difference between weapons other than how much damage they inflict. Doom lives on because it's maps were given emphasis and you wind up moving around a lot more than some modern shooters.Period. Some modern titles are so caught up in cinematic experiences, even whilst the player has control, that you wind up going down corridors and down a singular path that progresses the story both during cutscenes and outside of them. And there's nothing wrong with telling a captivating tale, but merely plopping you in a level and spending time designing that level is so simple it's kind of amazing that it isn't done more often. It's simplicity. There's no level between levels in Doom; you're at the Tower of Babel in one level and the next one is in a facility, with no level connecting the two and/or cinematic. It's almost like the old Super Mario Bros titles where you're in a water level here and the next one is a castle with the third one being an air ship.Before playing this I expected an outdated game that would be hard to get into. But no, it's such a simple game and because of that it has little to screw up and key things it can really achieve in. This wasn't the first ever FPS title; it isn't the BEST FPS title; but it's certainly a highly regarded one that miraculously stands the test of time and, amazingly, is still enjoyable and doesn't skip a single beat. Whether 1996 or 2016 it's still a blast to play, as if it never aged. Well, if you apply GZDoom, that is.			"

												John Stalvern waited. The lights above him blinked and sparked out of the air. There were demons in the base. He didn’t see them, but had expected them now for years. His warnings to Cernel Joson were not listenend to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.John was a space marine for fourteen years. When he was young he watched the spaceships and he said to dad “I want to be on the ships daddy.”Dad said “No! You will BE KILL BY DEMONS”There was a time when he believed him. Then as he got oldered he stopped. But now in the space station base of the UAC he knew there were demons.“This is Joson” the radio crackered. “You must fight the demons!”So John gotted his palsma rifle and blew up the wall.“HE GOING TO KILL US” said the demons“I will shoot at him” said the cyberdemon and he fired the rocket missiles. John plasmaed at him and tried to blew him up. But then the ceiling fell and they were trapped and not able to kill.“No! I must kill the demons” he shoutedThe radio said “No, John. You are the demons”And then John was a zombie.			"

												As someone who wasn't part of the generation that Doom released in, I am really impressed by it. Fast and satisfying gameplay all wrapped in incredible map design that is just not seen nowadays. This game has mostly aged with grace with an extremely dedicated community to it to this day.Just to warn anyone who wants to enjoy this game, do not play this game directly from your Steam library. The Steam version of the game is the game running on a DOS Box which doesn't work all that well; what you want to do is download a source port to play it properly on a modern computer. You still need to buy the game for some specific files to get the game running though. Here's an article with a list of source ports: http:// http://reddoorbluekey.com/pc-news/hurt-plenty-tour-best-doom-source-ports/ .

I guess there are some key cards and slight puzzle elements, open ended levels, and level exploration, but all of it ultimately is towards the goal of killing demons.  If you don't like killing demons... this game's about killing demons (TECHNICALLY you could do a pacifist run, but why would you with all these demons).  Demon/10, would exorcize again.			"

The game is really fun and worth $5 if you get a source port to play it with because dosbox the dos emulator used to run the game is terrible and sometimes with dosbox the game will crash on launch.

												It's a bit tricky to get this game to actually work in Winows 7/8, but it's worth a bit of trouble to do so. Why? Because it's Doom! THE Doom.It's a classic, it's not easy, and it was the big bad boogeyman of its time. And it actually holds up pretty well today, thanks to its action-packed levels and varied enemies. So if you're in the mood for some old-school action or just want to see what all the hubbub was about, I can easily recommend Doom. It's one of the old greats, and it has aged like a fine wine.And if glorious a 320x240 resolution turns you off, there are compeporary engines that you can use to load the game in, instead of using DOSBox as it comes packed with here. But I kind of prefer the autentic giant pixels for this one.RIP AND TEAR!			"

Long story short: One of the oldest, yet still engaging, shooters of the '90s. It's not only a graphical spectacle, it's also tightly desgined around skill-based encounters, while offering enough variety for a good six to eight hour game length, plus a butt-load of mods online. For those buying the Steam version, check the community guides to help you set it up for a more optimal introduction to the game.DISCLAIMER: While no demo is available on Steam, Googling Doom Shareware should lead you to the free version of the game, which contains only the first episode to give you a decently lengthed snippet of what the game is like.After the release of this game, every first-person shooter for the next few years were referred to as Doom clones purely because this game right here did everything so well. Simply, Doom is one of the tightest games you'll ever play. Guaranteed. While taking place on abandoned research bases on Mars, and eventually into Hell itself, the game's spooky vibes do not correspond with horror as much as balls-to-the-wall action. However, most of its spectacle is due to the fact that it was the first of its kind: many FPS games thereafter utilised Doom's formula, to varying and even greater degrees of success. To fully enjoy this game, try to forget all that you already know about games and take this game from its rawest form.Let's get it out of the way: Doom had a magnificent engine. It needed a decent rig to get working at the time, but man did it get 3D working so well. The engine allowed floors to be rendered at multiple heights, any angle conceivable, and all textured, allowing for some magnificent looking locales. Lighting also worked to build atmosphere and contrast between levels. And, enemy sprites were very detailed, and allowed them to be animated during attacks and hit animations from all angles. Briefly, it was visuals like no other.The sound is a little bit uninspired however. Some sound effects are public domain (the imp sound in particular), and may sound familiar. The music also takes a few, let's say, subtle hints from metal and grunge music of the '80s and '90s. However, all of it fits towards the demonic tone that the game goes for.The game consists of four episodes, each taking place in different locations. The aesthetics of each place vary a bit too, and the general design changes a bit too. Each episode introduces new things, allowing the player to constantly learn techniques and skills in tackling enemies. Every level also has a bunch of secrets (including some secret levels), which is a great way to give incentives to explore the levels.The highlight of the game in my opinion are the enemies. The weakest enemies, the Former Human and Sergeants, are also the only enemies that hitscan (attack with an instant bullet-like attack). Every other enemy uses projectiles of varying damage, speeds, and colours, and they're all avoidable. Doom's gameplay consists of dodging enemy attacks, prioritising targets, navigating and using the map to your advantage, and conserving ammo and attacking efficiently. It leads you in, gives you enough time to evaluate the threat, and skillfully execute a plan to either avoid or take out hoards of enemies. And it does this organically by not removing control or agency from the player.The weapons also have a huge layer of depth. Besides the slow starting pistol, every weapon you find doesn't out-right replace other weapons you get. Rather, each weapon has its own benefits and weaknesses. For example, the shotgun can deal large chunks of damage in successive blasts, but it's not as efficient or quick as other weapons, whereas the plasma rifle fires huge balls of energy at enemies, but have a delay between shooting and the projectile hitting the target. Each weapon works well against certain enemies, and the player organically learns these as the game goes on, rather than being down-right told about it.The levels are also designed to give varying degrees of challenge between encounters. While enemies are littered around the levels, generally you are presented rooms, and you have to solve problems with them, usually a locked door. This involves crossing the level sometimes, which may also have unlocked a hidden swarm of enemies. Fighting enemies in large open rooms, and fighting in closed in corridors provide different skill-sets.Doom also was pretty revolutionary for its modding system. The main game acts as a base archive, and custom levels or mods (in WAD files) replace or expand this content. It's simple to distribute, and resources such as the Idgames archive are being updated to this day with new and amazing content. I recommend the Brutal Doom mod, which replaces the weapons and enemy behaviors in a...ludicrous manner.Doom is one of the greatest games of all time, not because of its graphical leaps, but because it was also a tight as heck game. If you're going to grab the classic bundle, more mods are created for the sequel, Doom II, which expands on this game with crazier enemies and levels. The Doom 3 BFG Edition also includes this game and the sequel as well (not as Steam products, but within the title itself), and remains the best bundle for this game. The price point is a bit high for the game's age, but it's quality is worth every bit of it.RATING: 3 UP, 0 DOWNMy up/down rating system tries to differentiate between games that are mediocre (less ups and downs total), and games that are interesting but flawed (more ups and downs totals). Ups relate to how much good a game has, and downs are how much bad a game has.[/table]

  0 UPs 1 UPs 2 UPs 3 UPs   Not worth playing, skip it Alright, play it if you're into the genre Very good, play it if you're looking for something worth trying One to go down in history, a must have for everyone[/table]  0 DOWNs 1 DOWNs 2 DOWNs 3 DOWNs   Nothing detrimental in the game A few things wrong, but doesn't ruin it Kind-of broken or aggravating, you may not be able to put up with it Very, very broken, a lesson on what not to do "

												Great memorable and revolutionary game. Doom 2 and Final Doom are great too. Must haves for anyone who likes fun.Don't bother with the dosbox setup, as its pretty ♥♥♥♥. Get source ports like:-Chocolate DoomHighly Accurate to the original DOS executable (bugs and limits included), while being a windows based port. Great for a more authentic experience without the hassle of Dosbox. -PrBoom+Raises the static limitations of the original, options for Modern screen resolutions/OpenGL, and  includes support for the boom/MBF formats. Most maps for these formats are still generally traditional with the gameplay. Compatibility levels for different versions of doom make it good for demo playback.-ZDoom/GZDoomNumerous advanced features, and supports Heretic, Hexen, and Strife.  Mouselook and Jumping/Crouching are possible in this engine. Most mods for this tend to be less traditional with the gameplay, and often change things up a lot more. Great for those who want to play gameplay mods, and certain partial/total conversions.-Odamex/ZandronumThese are basically multiplayer source ports with online capabilities. Odamex for a more traditional approach, and Zandronum for a more modern approach.			"

												One of the biggest names in gaming. It is credited for kickstarting the FPS genre into mainstream success and pushing mature content into gaming in general. On a less worthy note, it was heavily blamed for failing grades, loss in work production and, much worse, school shooting and mass murders. Thankfully, more recent studies have discredited the more horrendous claims, but is the praise directed towards it justified? The short answer has been an obvious ""Freak yes!!!"" for most people who were at their gaming prime in the era, but what about the younger Milennials like myself and the current generation of teens not fully fitting said title but who are allowed such mature pleasures? Let's take a look.The game has a mian menu where you can simply click ""New game"" and choosing your desired chapter and one of cleverly named difficulties, from ""I'm Too Young to Die!"" all the way to ""Ultra-Violence"" and, what I can only guess as Romero's devious abortion-given-life, ""NIGHTMARE!,"" a difficulty where most of the speed run community has agreed is not required for ""hardest difficulty"" runs, Ultra-Violence the accepted level of challenge for these teeth-gritters. Tangent aside, once you pick your options, the unthinkable for the modern-era happens; you're thrust into the game right at the start. No cuscenes, not even a loading screen. Just you, a gun, and stuff for you to shoot and pick up. the enemies are varied and the number and types depend on your chosen difficulty. The mission is simple: to kill demons andget to the end of the level. Gunplay is simple and there's no looking up or down as per 1993 technology. Instead, it aims up and down for you. the last level of each chapter culminates into a boss figh. The first chapter ""Knee-Deep in the Dead"" simply introduces you to Barons of Hell which becomes regular troops in later chapters, the 2nd Shores of Hell"" pits you against the iconic Cyberdemon, the third ""Inferno"" thrusts you against the Chaingunning Spider Mastermind and the 4th chapter ""Thy Flesh Consumed"" has essentially an extended remake of the third's (which I will delve into soon).The simple and straightfoward gameplay was the joy of many people back in the 90's, and with the releases of hyper-scripted and otherwise sub-par games in recent years, younger players can find refreshing enjoyment too. And there's one aspect of the game that has ensured its continuing relevancy: Mods. A feature that modern companies avoid like the plague since it nullifies their ability to shove broken DLC into the market, mods are custom bits of content made by players for the game to distribute freely on the internet. From simple map-packs to complete souce-ports to bring the game into modern systems, DOOM's modding community has been providing content since the game's release. With more content to download that any game today can provide in DLC, it's always worth going online and seeing what you can pick up and play from the DOOM community.There are a few problems, however. The aforementioned 4th chapter is the biggest, as it has no continuity for the skill romp in the previous chapters, instead just thrusting you into a bunch of insane levels with no regards to actual balance or skill cap, and the last non-secret level simply just gives you another Spider Mastermind as a boss with more enemies to fight in other arenas. The ""Nightmare!"" difficulty which I went on a tangent about is ignored for a reason, as it has all of the monster count of Ultra-Violence, but increases the damage of the monsters by 50% and respawns them after 10-20 seconds, making longer levels almost impossible, even for the nimble speed runners. These problems are avoidable, as Ultra-Violence is the community agreed ""hardest difficulty"" And most people don't bat an eyelash when you say you hate ""Thy Flesh Consumed"". The only other problem I've run across are the Barons being regular troops, as their high health pool simply makes them an ammo-consuming meat-sack as modern WASD controls mean you can easily avoid their slow but damaging main attack.The game holds up through all these years, and despite the flaws, can be enjoyable for anyone of any age. With simple gameplay, and mods and source ports that usher the game into the modern era, you'd be a fool not to pick this game up long with the Sequel, Doom II: Hell on Earth. Heck, even buy the DOOM Classic complete, as you get even more demon-slaying goodness. Happy hunting.			"

												The best game ever made, perhaps.  Very easy to play it on Steam using whatever sourceport or frontend you might prefer: just throw it in the game's install folder and rename your chosen executable to dosbox.  Using ZDL with gzDoom makes it super easy for me to load up the game with whatever WAD I feel like playing — including Doom II, for example, provided I copy doom2.wad into the same folder (or just direct ZDL to its location).  You can even throw in stuff like pk_anim.wad (look it up) for smoother weapon animations, which is pretty neat.  Some of you might prefer Chocolate Doom over something like gzDoom for a more pixel-accurate early '90s experience: easily done.  Maybe you want to switch over to Zandronum for some deathmatch: you got it.  Anyway, yes.  Lots of FPS games have come and gone, but Doom remains the golden standard for me.  With all the fantastic WADs available out there, it's a gift that keeps on giving.			"

The ""Nightmare!"" difficulty which I went on a tangent about is ignored for a reason, as it has all of the monster count of Ultra-Violence, but increases the damage of the monsters by 50% and respawns them after 10-20 seconds, making longer levels almost impossible, even for the nimble speed runners. These problems are avoidable, as Ultra-Violence is the community agreed ""hardest difficulty"" And most people don't bat an eyelash when you say you hate ""Thy Flesh Consumed"". The only other problem I've run across are the Barons being regular troops, as their high health pool simply makes them an ammo-consuming meat-sack as modern WASD controls mean you can easily avoid their slow but damaging main attack.The game holds up through all these years, and despite the flaws, can be enjoyable for anyone of any age. With simple gameplay, and mods and source ports that usher the game into the modern era, you'd be a fool not to pick this game up long with the Sequel, Doom II: Hell on Earth. Heck, even buy the DOOM Classic complete, as you get even more demon-slaying goodness. Happy hunting.			"

												(as you may have guessed, my Steam playtime do not represent my actual hours in DOOM, which are probably in the thousands)Still one of the best (if not the the best) shooters ever made.Originally released in 1993, DOOM raised the bar and set the standard for the FPS genre.Unlike many shooters of the time, DOOM has aged extremely well thanks to its great design and is still very much playable today if you can look past its dated (but still nice) graphics.DOOM still has a very active community that continues to play the game online and make mods for it, so there's tons of content out there even after you've beat the game.Pros:Smooth gameplay that just feels right, gunning down hordes of demons never gets old.Legendary level design, memorable maps with tons of secrets.Active modding/multiplayer community.Decent graphics (albeit dated), still manages a to build a good atmosphere.Good music, sound design is generally pretty good too.Cons:Lacklustre ""port"", it's just the old v1.9 DOS exec ran under DOSBox. I'd highly recommend downloading a modern ""source port"" such as ZDoom[zdoom.org], GZDoom[forum.drdteam.org](ZDoom with a modern OpenGL renderer), or Zandronum[zandronum.com](GZDoom with client-server multiplayer) for the best DOOM experience.Which raises another issue, this game is designed for keyboard, so playing with WASD + Mouse makes the game a bit easy compared to just arrow keys.Framerate is locked to 35 FPS, which is fixed in aforementioned source ports.The price seems a tiny bit high for such an old game, definitely worth it on sale however.

												A true classic.  There are better fronmtends capable of running DOOM (like ZDoom, GZdoom, etc...) than using DOSBox.  ""Ultimate Doom"" is the final developer's master cut of DooM and whether you are a veteran or newbie to the original DooM series, it is quite enjoyable.I have only one word of warning to the new generation of gamers attempting DooM for the first time, barely anyone who played this back in the eraaly to mid 1990's used a mouse.  Doom was not exactly designed around aiming up or down, so do not be surprised if you use a frontend outside of DOSBox to play it and notice bilboard sprite monsters.			"

												FIRST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If you are running this on Windows 7 (especially x64):1. Find the game executable. (If you don't know what that is, find a nerd and for the love of all that is holy, don't try this yourself.)2. Right click and then left click on properties.3. In the window that pops up, click the ""compatibility"" tab and then the tick box next to ""run this in compatibility mode."" Or something to that effect.4. Select ""Windows XP Service Pack 2"" in the drop down thingie.5. Try it out.6. If that doesn't allow you to play it, then repeat steps 1 and 2. But also click on the ""compatibility"" tab.7. Tick the ""run in 640 x 480"" box.8. Try it again.9. If that doesn't work, google how to run the game in windowed mode. It's actually easy, just more steps than I can put here.10. Try it one more time..11. If it still doesn't work. Go find a nerd.This is a classic and dare I say iconic piece of gaming history! I bet many of you remember playing one of the versions of doom on either an ancient PC or console. I recall playing the first Doom on SNES, leaving the system on for days at a time so I could sleep and pick up where I left off and finally beat it. Taking shifts with my two best friends.. Good times. Then buying that wonderful little gadget made by Naki or something I think that took some AA batteries and allowed you to save a game that didn't have a save function via some form of wizardry to me at the time.All of the Doom iterations where good. I don't recall a single bomb. This one was super awesome, in particular. Was grateful to see it here on Steam. :D If memory serves, there was a CD that came with some video game magazine back in the day that had 1000+ extra levels that you could install to this game so you could go on playing virtually forever. One of those CDs will eventually be found millions of years in the future by aliens or whomever inherits the earth after we destroy ourselves, but doubtful you're going to find one. I can't really say here, but I would suggest getting on a big wooden boat with a flag that resembles a warning label and sale the 7 seas looking for them in another form.			"

												I say go play it! A game of my childhood and a game I still play to this day. I grew up with the PSX version along with Doom 64, however, this game still brings the nostalgia and still keeps you entertained to this day!Ultimate Doom comes with 4 awesome episodes and each episode contains 8 levels plus an extra secret level each. In my opinion the best way to play this is to get a sourceport of your choice (GZdoom [I use this], Zdoom, or possibly prboom) and relive the nostalgia or if you are new to Doom, the experience the greatness! One of, if not the grandpa of the FPS genre (however, you can argue Wolfenstein 3D did it first or even the ""true original shooter"" could be argued there too I geuss) but honestly, Doom really is what took the genre to a new level. The internet has the best ways on how to set up a sourceport, but basically you just paste the ""doom.wad"" file from your steam game into the sourceport folder and WELLA! It should work when you run the sourceport .exe!Also, the content for this game is endless, with so many WADS made for it. However, to get the most content out of these games, also get Doom II, as most WADS are made for that game! Heck, just get the entire classic complete collection. Totally worth it!P.S. my hours on this game are so low because I use the sourceport and the .wad externally, rather than through steam, however if you like to show off your hours, you can set that up.

												I haven't so much memories with Doom. I remember having like ""Minigames 200 in 1"" disk, what contains a small games in it (well, that's obvious). I saw this game, but controlls were awful (not like the original, surprisingly), and I just forgot about it. 7 years later, I saw a discount on a steam, and I'm glad, what I bought the Classic Complete Pack.But back in business. Graphics are pretty good, and will never gets old for this legendary game.Soundtrack is outstanding, and that's why you must like Doom. Even though I prefer FMOD soundfont, the OPL soundtrack is not that bad, and there's couple of them, what I like too.Gameplay is simple - you get guns, you USE guns to get to the end.Mod supporting is making this game playable as hell, because people love it, and mod creators is on top! Tons of them to do your own experience. Without GZDoom, I think my fingers will be tired in a 1 hour. And Brutal Doom, well, I don't need to explain you, the name speaks for itself.If you like to play some old games, it's definitely worth a try.			"

												Doom is a legendary FPS that came out in 1993 on PC and was ported to many other consoles, with ports of various quality. It was released by shareware model and had 3 episodes if your ordered. Later it was released as Ultimate Doom, adding the 4th episode.Compared to other ports it has full levels and most content. PS1 and Saturn port have it combined with Doom 2 levels and have dark horror atmosphere, with N64 having it's own dark horror atmosphere and was like a new game build from scratch, with it's own levels. The only thing some ports have over PC technically got to be colored lighting. So, you don't miss much, be happy with DOS version.As old game, we should take a look at how Steam version handles Doom. And well, Id Software once again did a horrible job with handling DOSBox.First, it wasn't configured probably, thus it lags amazingly in full-screen mode. To fix that you have to go to game's folder and edit line at ""output"" to ""opengl"" in ""ultimate.conf"" and ""ultimatem.conf"" files.Second, as you launch game you will notice that you get to choose two control methods: with mouse and classic (Like real man, keyboard only!). And it uses Soundblaster device for Music instead of Midi that everybody is used to. You may think that you can use DOSBox, navigate to game's folder and launch ""setup.exe"" to configure stuff for yourself, but too bad! Id Software decided not to put it into Steam's version. Your only way to configure controls and music is editing ""DEFAULT.CFG"" and ""MOUSE.CFG"" files. Where you have to guess which numbers is related to what keyboard button.But once you fixed all those issues you will finally get to play Doom. Ultimate edition, yep. Without any plot or cutscenes... Errr, aside from those at the end of episodes. Without much plot and cutscenes, you are going to be immeditly thrown into levels, each one being a compilated maze and a step over the ealier FPS levels, also having buttons to press which can do something else aside from opening doors and keys to collect. Each of 4 episodes has 8 normal levels and 1 secrets, and I gotta say that the secret level of the third episode is brilliant idea. I also should mention that the first, WHOLE first episode is available for free in demo (shareware) version of a game, and that game is easier than Doom 2 in general. Aside form the 4th episode, which was added with Ultimate Doom version and is even harder than Doom 2, especially first few levels, though that episode doesn't have any new content to it.The presentation of the game is quite good. It's colorful more or less while giving it a dirty darkish feeling. Heck, game was considered scary at release, with usage of sector lighting, it even has has fog-like effect where you can see less clearly in dark places, nice. The resolution isn't big and colors are still quite limited, but with all the maze nacigation and sprite scaling it had to do, the game was at the top of technology cutting edge, especially in FPS genre. At least on PC and consoles, Arcades were still kicking. So, you can say that this was the point where console players got something to envy PCs over, while playing their own awesome platformers.Gameplay is just plain awesome, pure arcadeish FPS. It's quite a fast-paced game, with many pickups, wide enemy variety, set of weapons, non-regenerating health, map that you can call with Tab so you will not get lost in mazes and, most importantly, instead of being focused on cover-hiding, it was more about projectile avoidance and more out-into-field shooting and running. Well, almost. Zombie enemies still shoot hitscan at you, but those are low-tier enemies, die easily, not used as much as imps. And compared to many other FPS at that time, Doom is more of fair challenge. Once again, Doom is not perfect, it got hitscan zombies with gun and it even forces you to run over damaging acid/lava few times in some levels, it's not Heretic, but compared to games on Build engine, it's better.Though one of the things that may put people off is that levels are abstract mazes. Looking nice but making no logical sense of place to it.It has 8 weapons to keep, from useless fist and pistol, up to BFG9000. It's not perfectly balanced, plasmagun outdoes chaingun, while chaingun outdoes pistol while using same ammo pool, but it's a step over Wolf3D, as in some situation some weapons are better. The effective use of BFG9000 also doesn't make common sense, you should read FAQ somewhere over this. But hey, at least it was before SuperShotgun came, with it being best weapon in whole game in Doom 2.Dissapointing thing got to be bosses. There is only few. Two uncommon dangerous Barons of Hell in Episode 1, which were used later anyway. And then there is Cyberdemon in Episode 2 who's attack can be avoided too easily and Spider Mastermind in Episode 3 who has hitscan attack and you just have to rush him down. Episode 4 also doesn't have anything of it's own.Multiplayer isn't supported in Steam version, you will have to use Zandronum source port. Or some other mutlipalyer source ports.So, Ultimate Doom is awesome FPS. Simpler than Doom 2, but less brown and has it's own feel. You get to run over mazes while shooting down enemies in fast-paced manner. It's legendary too, though not perfect game. Highly recommended, none the less.If you want to get into Doom modding and mods, then instead head toward Doom 2 destination, sir.			"

												Pros- Satisfying Gunplay. Running around like a jackrabbit as a space marine blowing the bits out of demons and zombies with like chainguns, shotguns, and plasma guns is pretty fun.- Fun to explore levels, though I will admit it is pretty easy to get lost in some areas.- Interesting Enemy designs- Did I mention you're a space marine fighting demons in mars all the way through hell?Cons- It's a game from 1994. The graphics arent great by today's standards and you may very well not. Also first few tries running the game, it didn't mouse support, And had to look through the steam forums for a fix. You may have the same issues.If you can stand graphics from 20 years ago and enjoy first person shooters where you obliterate armies of demons, yes you may very well like this game and pretty much the entire Doom Classic Pack. They're all pretty dope.Note: I'd highly suggest you also try playing the mod Brutal Doom. It's a pretty dope mod, it's pretty much the same game only more difficult and with improved animation sprites and gore, as well as additional takedowns and weapons. You'd just need GZdoom to run it, and i'd actually suggest installing either Zdoom or GZdoom. They run the game better than DOSbox does, plus you've got a lot more options in the options menu.			"

												I don't really suggest buying this version of the game, but I'm still leaving a thumbs up because it's DOOM and it's cheap, but it's hard to say which version to suggest because they mostly all have something annoying about them.For new players I suggest buying the Doom 3 BFG Edition which includes Ultimate Doom and Doom II running in something of a wrapped, enhanced port with higher resolution, better speed and controls, and sadly some gutted features as well. It is much easier to get running properly.This version runs in DOSBox and while there's nothing wrong with that, the config file is missing from the Steam version of this release, and they've never fixed this, and they really should, so I can change my options. The GOG version doesn't have this problem. It's hard not to recommend a version of DOOM, but I would say buy this on GOG instead of steam if you want to emulate DOS properly, or buy BFG if you want to get into the game quickly and just play. It's worth noting that the BFG versions have Achievements, while that's more or less not even possible on the DOSBox versions. This version would be a better value if it came wrapped in its own port as well, with the option to run it in emulated DOS if so desired.Whichever version you do get is no big deal because the real fun starts once you're running DOOM in the source port of your choice such as GZDoom if you like pretty lights, or Chocolate Doom if you wanna stay purist. All you need is the WAD file from any version of the game.If you really want this version of the game to be completionist or whatever then you're probably shopping for a boxed copy of Ultimate Doom anyway, but if you're not, go ahead and pick this up if you really need to run it in emulated DOS. I don't know if you can even install this on a real DOS system.			"

												Classic. It's a word that is used often... And really, I think it's lost it's impact. Everything that holds nostalgic value in some way, shape and form is ""classic"". Whether jokingly admiring an admittedly BAD piece of media that you liked as a kid, or enjoying one of many similar games out there, ones that don't entirely speak for themselves; we all state that the things we like are ""classic"". In this case, the genre already existed in various, fledgling forms such as Maze War, and Spasim in the early 70's... All the way up to the venerable title Wolfenstein, a game that helped truly mold the genre at it's most basic values, by the very same company that crafted the leviathan trend-setter for the ages- the masterpiece I'm going to attempt to describe here. It was a title that, at the time, would have been mentioned of in hushed excited tones by the kids at school. A title that was so wildly different, the news media used its inferno-based imagery and its playstyle as a scapegoat for heinous crimes committed. A title SO revolutionary that every single developer creating games that followed in its footsteps were considered ""clones""....And rightfully so, many were just carbon copying the EXACT ideals, or in MOST cases, even code, right from this legend. This was the mark of something different, in how was distributed, in how open and accessable much of the content was, and how people played games together: over the internet. The most classic game of this genre may not be the very FIRST of its kind, but the genre truly coalesced with one Big. ♥♥♥♥ing. Game. It's name is Doom. and it is classic. Even if you did not like doom, or grow up with it or even PLAY Doom... Go look up the definition of classic. While those things may be subjective, and that's why we're capable of throwing the label onto anything, it is undeniable that this game is the grandaddy of them all.       I've given a large enough intro, and i doubt anyone wants to ready the lofty and article-like writing of a giant nerd such as myself for hours, regarding a game that you probably don't even fully care for... So I'll break this down for you.-The perspective had been done before (and then CONSTANTLY AFTER), but the quality and the art drawn in was revolutionary. It still holds up to this day with the right Source Mod (more on that later)- The sounds, the lighting effects, everything it set out to do, such as running on lower end machines, and even looking and sounding better on NEWER ones, meant that the modular tuning and graphics engine design were brilliant, John Carmack crafted an amazing source code.-The set up, a protagonist with no dialogue, the story elements cut, is another trend-setter for the genre. The creators intention despite the entertaining HUD, was to make YOU the protagonist, allowing you to relate more and create your own feeling for the nameless marine.-Multiplayer. Coop with damage enabled, and deathmatch. Doom did it arguably first, or for the time, best.-How the title was distributed: you got Episode 1 (sound familiar, Valve fans?) for free. 9 levels to play and enjoy nearly everything Doom offered. Free. If you enjoyed it? There were more to buy and enjoy. This leads to two gigantic pillars for which Doom stands as the father of FPS, and helped inspire Valve to do what they're loved for now-The source code became open and free to modify a few years later. This allowed for countless mods using Ids revolutionary and modular ""WAD"" file format. - and for people to convert the source code to run on platform ports (source ports), so that this old DOS game can work on modern machines.... While enjoying mods that enhance and even modernize gameplay.The best (well rounded) Source Port to download is GZDoom. Get that, buy this, and run your doom.wad through it. Tune the old graphics enough to clean them up, and relive the classic.Once you're done, get some mods. I recommend:Brutal DoomProject MSX - (amazing HUD with modern mechanics, changes monsters)Dark 7 - ( amazing mapset, play it with Project MSX)----------------------------------------------------------------------------Those can get you started. And yes, GZDoom will allow you to look UP and DOWN with your mouse...Jump (which is cheating ;] ) and even crouch.Enjoy.Fun facts about Doom:Not only was Valve likely inspired by their open distribution of the title, and source-code policies, but they got their start in game design thanks to Id software.Gabe Newell and Doug Lombardi visited Id around the time of their next trend setter- the fully 3D Quake. Id helped them start up by giving the entrepeneur coders the source code to Quake, Id Tech 2.... Which they then heavily modified and dubbed Gold Source.... Officialy GoldSrc. This engine powered Half Life.When Gabe Newell was still working for Microsoft, he was the programmer that ported Doom over to Windows from DOS, in an attempt to get more people to accept the platform, as Doom was the most widely downloaded application of the era. It had been downloaded and installed more than Windows itself at the time.			"

												This is one of the best games I have ever played. I did not have this game when I was young because I wasn't even alive then so I didn't go into this game for the nostalgia. I love older games because they feel better to some newer games. So instead of getting call of duty infinte warfare get this and have money left over. Get the package for all of the games though. The only problem is that sometimes it will glitch on the title screen or when you start a game up. Get DosBox to fix this sometimes. but just keep reloading the game. 10/10			"

I both love the COD and Battlefield franchises but this game has given me more fun in 4 hours than the 80+ hours Ive played on BO3. You get a lot more than what you pay for. Plus when you beat the main story you can go online and download custom maps, or download mods like ""Brutal Doom"". or play online with your friends. You cant beat the classics!			"

												Waited until 2016 to play this classic; should've gone to it way earlier.I have no real experience with FPS games or playing with keyboards. Despite this, I finally checked out Doom and regret not doing so sooner. It's an absolute blast; fun, challenging gameplay with a high skill ceiling. The level design is top-notch, making each level both a gauntlet and a puzzle. Recommended to anyone who enjoys challenging, fast-paced gameplay, whether or not they're normally into shooters.			"

												What is quite possibly the most important video game series of my childhood, DOOM has stood out among the many titles I've played throughout my lifetime and it still remains to be a game that I always come back to no matter how many times I've played through it beginning to end. I remember the first time I've played through this and hearing the stomping of the Cyberdemon. It was a magical moment that still hits me to this day. I've played this game for over fifteen years on single player, cooperative, and deathmatch modes. This game simply never gets old. It appeases to players of all difficulties, from the easiest I'm Too Young To Die to Nightmare!, this game will always have suit the level of madness that you want each and every time.And as if it couldn't possibly get any better, countless PWADs exist on the internet, granting you a lifetime of blind playthroughs. This game simply cannot get better.			"

												It's DOOM. Play this if you like old-school games, gaming history and/or well-designed shooters & somehow haven't tried it yet. What else is there to say about it?Alright, I'll give it a shot. In 1993, ID Software more or less revolutionized the first-person shooter genre (again) with a game that was not only blazingly fast and good-looking for the time, but played and aged so well it inspired a fanbase that persists to this day.There have been tens of thousands of custom maps and modifications for Doom and its immediate sequel over the years that take the game in every conceivable direction, and while the 'Doomer' fandom isn't exactly the monstrously huge construction you'd expect to find camping on tumblr*, there's no sign of Doom being truly abandoned any time soon.You might think, yeah, it was good in its day, but it looks so crude and simple today. Why would anyone still play it? Well, apart from the huge realm of custom content, Doom's gameplay is simply very, very well-tuned. It's a little comparable to bullet hell or chess, in that there's more focus on dodging enemy attacks than there is on tanking them.Doom's monster AI is simple yet open-ended enough to make for a wide variety of tactical situations, and the player's movement & weaponry aren't any less finely crafted. The one criticism that I can think of is that the gatling gun (which is also incorrectly referred to as a 'chaingun') more or less replaces your starting pistol.Basically, it's easy to get into, but has enough nuance and depth to carry itself even today. For a while after it was released, games in a similar style were explicitly called 'Doom clones'. To the modern observer, Doom managed to drive progress in the genre enough that in hindsight there really wasn't much shame to be had in being a 'clone' of such an excellent game. (Shoving hundreds of WADs from the Internet into a commercially-released CD was another story.[doom.wikia.com])You can't look up or down either, at least not in the game's original form. While there's absolutely something to be said for Doom's purity of form (and compensating autoaim), the ability to look in any direction is kind of a boon for newer games.You probably wouldn't want to play this for the story: you'll literally only find the setup in the game's manual. There's just enough story to justify what's happening in the game, although what's there is good for what it is.Once the technology was in place, Doom also became a catalyst for early online gaming. This game is, in fact, where the term 'deathmatch' came from. There's still[zandronum.com] options[www.zdaemon.org] available to play Doom with or against other people, without the murderous rates people had to pay 20 years ago. Perhaps bare-bones in comparison to today's offerings, but certainly faster in pace and intensity.Steam's included DOSBox port is pretty poor, so I would recommend grabbing a sourceport like Chocolate Doom or ZDoom. Those two are my personal favorites - the former lets you experience the game as it was in the '90s, and the latter lets you easily load all sorts of modern mods and enhancements.Doom's default controls are frankly a relic from the pre-WASD standard days, but fortunately pretty much every sourceport lets you change the controls and even look up & down if you wish. I would recommend at least trying the original controls, though, if you're going to start playing Doom.If you really want to experience classic Doom, you'd do well to pick up its aforementioned sequel at the very least. It adds new enemies and one new weapon, not to mention 32 new levels, and it's been more popular with custom level designers ever since it came out in 1994. That may not sound like much, but then again, if it ain't broke...As of this humble summation of Doom, the game in question has persisted for 23 years. I would seriously bet that it will last 23 more.*Not that I particularly dislike tumblr, of course.			"

												Now this is the one everybody remembers.  If you played a PC game in 1995, you played Doom.  Everyone played Doom.  Companies had to institute rules and ban Doom from being played during business hours, because too many employees were playing deathmatches.  Doom was so popular that Microsoft developed a port of it to work on their new Windows 95, in hopes of getting more people to buy the operating system, this of course after Bill Gates toyed with the idea of buying out ID Software all together.But even with its popularity, there was the mounds of controversy.  Some hated it for its high levels of blood and gore, others for its satanic symbols.  Groups tried to ban it, tried to get it out of the public eye, blamed it for school shootings and random acts of violence.  Many tried to connect it to violent behavior in young adults, citing the violence learned in the game being brought to reality.  But through all of this it stood tall, exactly what it was, simply a game.Doom is one of those classics that everyone needs to experience   You don’t have to play the whole thing, or beat every level under par.  But every gamer, that wants to truly be a gamer, should spend a little time running around the halls of the UAC facility on the Mars moon.			"

												The most influential first person-shooter of all time, and likely still the greatest. Even after 21 years, no game combines the simple but challenging mix of gunplay, exploration and resource management quite as successfully. A plethora of sourceports keep the game feeling fresh; add to that the almost legendary modding community, still going strong after 2 decades, and you have a game that delivers not only tremendous entertainment value, but an entire legacy. An absolute must-have for practically any gamer on the planet.			"

												How much I longed to play it again, but this time here, on Steam. The last time I replayed Doom was... wow, I don't even remember. I might have launched it few times in last 10 years but I know for sure that I didn't finished it from begin to end in all this time. So here I am, replaying another classic and legend of PC gaming.Game from 1995 should feel really old, right? Outdated graphics, sounds, controls and more. It's not the case with Doom. Even low resolution (which can be somehow fixed/changed to higher anyway) is not a problem. Graphics still looks great, soundtrack is one of best made in gaming history and controls... playing a FPS game using only keyboard never felt more comfortable than in id Software games. After so many years it's still played by many players - be it original version or with single and multiplayer mods. It's so much fun, game where killing is fun, level designs makes you use your head and SECRETS, who doesn't love secrets? Fighting your way in 4 episodes, which are filled with many missions. Even if you are playing on ""normal"" difficult level, it's easy to nice that with every next level game is getting harder. And getting 100% on kills, items and secrets on every level is harder that it looks, that is if you are playing without any guides.Some people will probably think that this price tag is kinda funny - paying this much for 21 years old game!? I bought my copy at sale but still, in my opinion, Ultimate DOOM is worth every price. It's legendary game, so if you never played it - do it right now or wait for sale, if you think they are asking too much for old game.			"

												Doom is quite simply the best shooter ever made and it's not just the nostalgia talking. The pure unadulterated ultra-violence is still as raw and visceral as it was when it was released in 1993. In terms of pure enjoyment in the form of fast paced action, this game delivers in spades. It is what every shooter today pretends not to be as they try to disguise themselves under thinly veiled attempts at plot and character development, a no-brainer all out gore fest. It gives us what we want from a shooter with no unnecessary bells and whistles too often used in modern FPS games to cover up the fact that the game play is simply lacking behind the masquerade of fancy graphics and tedious cut-scenes that ultimately get in the way of the fun, I'm looking at you Call of Duty. I love intricate stories and fully developed characters in games, notable examples of these are the Mass Effect and Witcher series, but this is a genre that has never been about that. This is a genre where the only time you should get a break from the action is the loading screen between levels. Moreover, thanks to the dedicated and thriving fan base there are a plethora of mods and custom WAD files that are constantly breathing new life in to this game. 21 years later and there are still multiplayer servers active, that alone is pretty impressive.

												(spoilerfree review)Greatest shooter of all time!I played my complete playthrough of Ultimate Doom for the first time in 2014 and I'm still impressed!The soundtrack with the metal / rock music from the 80's and 90's is awesome!The gameplay is awesome! For one of the first FPS this had an amazing gameplay with speed!I played Doom in ""Hurt me plenty"" and I was challenging. I will try ""Ultra-Violence"" with pleasure!The Leveldesign is brillant. Very often I was amazed and I thought: ""Holy ♥♥♥♥, this leveldesign kicks more ♥♥♥ than nowadays game."" This is really sad that a shooter from 1993 has better designed levels than fps from the past years.A big plus is the doom community. Doom is one of this game with the biggest community and a large achrive with custom levels / mods. Check it out, there are many goldies!The Doom Engine was amazing it its time.Ultimate Doom is a re-release of doom 1 in the year 1995. As far as I know, Ultimate Doom made Level E1M1 more Deathmatch compatible and there is a brand new (for it's time of course) fourth episode.id Software, please make DOOM (4) at least like this game and you will ROCK!

												If you never heard of doom, then there is something wrong with you. The story is basic, but you don't come to play doom for story you play for gameplay damn it. The gameplay in doom is basic but addicting and very challenging none the less. The weapons are typical you have a chainsaw, pistol, shotgun, chain gun, rocket launcher, plasma gun, and the BFG 9k. There is a total of 4 episodes all of which are all well designed. I recommend using skulltag if you want better controls and multiplayer which is very fun and addicting. Along with that there is a ♥♥♥♥ load of wars some of  my favorites are the stranger, brutal doom, doom vercetti, and natzis.10/10 legendary game you need to play it			"

Uh oh! The map is being overrun by enemies! Do you:A. Escort a poorly programmed essential A.I. through monotonous level design for a QTE finale?B. Grind your way through ham-fisted and mind-numbing exposition atop consecutive turret sections?C. Hold down the fire button as the rail-shooter pulls you through an abysmal excuse of a narrative?The correct answer? D, baby. D is for Doom.Your mission is simple: rip and tear your way through the hordes of hell with your arsenal of bloody mayhem, experiencing the revolutionary shooter that set the world afire and the tears of outrage and controversy flowing. The godfather of the FPS genre is still in excellent shape, even after more than twenty years since release. Don't let the system requirements put you off, this runs perfectly well on new operating systems with a few tweaks. It's pretty easy to take for granted from a modern perspective what games such as Doom, System Shock and Half-Life had on the gaming industry upon their release; almost single-handedly creating and then revolutionising the FPS genre. The phenomenal response to the shareware release of Doom and it's colossal (and enduring) success is due to absolutely nailing the formula and standard that id had previously set with Wolfenstein.From the exceptional level design, full of secrets and opportunities for your trusty shotgun to earn its keep, to the brilliant soundtrack backed by excellent sound design as yet another imp is blown away, Doom is everything that many shooters have forgotten: Simple, bloody, fast and instantly gratifying chaos. When was the last time you played something that was this much fun?Too outdated for you? Then install Brutal Doom, the Project Brutality add-on or various source ports to bring the blood into a whole new era. Welcome back, marine.""Good? Bad? I'm the guy with the gun."" Hell awaits.

												I'm bored of modern shooters that are super slow compared to old school FPS like Doom and Quake.This game is one of the best FPS game EVER made. The vanilla game aged well, and the amount of AMASING custom campaigns/mods and stuff that are free out there is just mind blowing.I would suggest you to play this mod :Brutal DoomHere are some amasing campaigns that works with it :Hell on Earth

												I didn't get into gaming til 2003 so I missed the old-school games and I regret it. I picked up Ultimate Doom a few weeks ago on a Steam sale and I have been playing the crap out of this game. Gameplay is solid, controls are easy to use and even though the game is short compared to today's gaming standard, the replay value more than makes up for it.			"

												This game is a masterpiece. It's my all-time favorite game along with Doom II. The original version of this game is actually better than his successor since the level design in this game is extraordinary. I've never played a game so good, it still holds up to this day and it's highly replayable. The original team of id Software did it right the first time.10/10			"

												If you buy this, or any of the other classic DOOM games, you have 2 options to have a decent experience:1: Get the .WAD files and use them with a source port of your choice, however this wont track your stats on steam.2: Put a source port in the game directory and rename the source port exe to 'dosbox.exe' and delete the original dosbox of course. This will let you run a source port and still have Steam track game time and show when you're playing it.Don't even bother using the DOSbox emulation that comes with it, it has performance issues, runs in an awful resolution, has awful sound emulation, and has no mouse look option whatsoever, if you plan on playing it 100% faithful to the original DOS experience, don't use DOSbox, build or buy a 486.Wait, a review for the game? Saying great things about it is basically copypasta at this point, you've heard it before.			"

												For 10 bucks you'd at least expect a proper port that doesn't require extra configuration, editing tons of text lines and downloading of other files over the internet to actually work. Doom is amazing. This port isn't.The newer your operating system, the least chances to not crash on start.If you are new to the Doom series and want to give the first 2 games a shot, use a source port such as GZDoom[gzdoom.drdteam.org] or ZDoom[zdoom.org] instead. There are many ports out there and not only are they easy to install and use, but also come with better option menus that allow for different resolutions, graphical settings, modern controls and vertical mouselook.If you're still rotting for this vanilla feel this steam port is supposed to bring, try out the Chocolate Doom port[www.chocolate-doom.org], which simulates how the game was played back in the 90's.

												Most people have already said most of the great stuff about this game, so I'm just going to tell you not to play the steam game alone, play it with a source port galled GZdoom. Some negative reviews of this game on steam say that the steam version sucks but the game itself is good, well GZdoom fixes almost everything about the steam game, so play this game, and you have to use GZ doom or you're doing it wrong, you will do yourself a favor, and 5 dollars isn't that much for most people. If you can't afford spending 5 dollars, you shouldn't be playing games anyway until you fix your financial problems.			"

												Oddly enough this game will freeze as soon as you get to the title screen without you editing the .cfg files.Although this game is amazing and has me playing for hours! I personally love this game to death becauseof its creative levels and it being a revival of the whole FPS genre! While it is a very short 3-5 hour game,you can download and create your own levels quite easily for a game from 1994. This game is highly reccomendedto those that are looking back at it for nostolgia and younger gamers (such as myself) who want to look back atthe once good FPS genre. 10/10 Amazing!			"

												So, If you're planning to buy this game. DO IT. But make sure you buy all four games together in the classic pack. It was only 24 bucks in my country so it'll probably even less in yours! If you don't live in Bahamas or The South Africa of course. Doom was made back in 1993 by ID software and it completely changed the game industry with it's terrific theme and beautiful atmosphere but it wasn't only those two what made this game popular. It is also known as the father of all the FPS games we know today (After Wolfenstein 3D made a year before doom by the same devs.) and It is definitely worth getting back to those old times and want to try a fantastic and a challenging game. The level design was perfect. The atmosphere was great that it still managed to scare me at some points of the game. Not even mentioning the soundtrack which is impressive! Compared to Doom II, I found this one better. The only thing that broke the DOOM II is it's complicated and interesting level design. If you don't want to spend hours trying to beat one map. Get this one. You can also download tons of WADs and mods to contiune the fun even after you finish the game. In conclusion, just buy it already. Trust me it'll be worth it...			"

												Due to the recent release of the new Doom, I decided I should buy the classic(s) on my steam account too.On its own, I think the controls are really weird in the steam version as you use the mouse for pretty much everything, but with Zdoom launcher, you can customize them in any way you like, which makes the game really easy to play.Other than that, I can't say anything bad about the game. It hasn't aged badly at all and it's the classic Doom, the first fps I ever played and one of the best ever made (in my opinion).			"

												'Ultimate' DooM may have been ultimate in '95, but nowadays it's basically archaic. I don't even consider the base version playable--an 800x600 window that ♥♥♥♥s up Windows' colors? Eww--Z-Doom is basically required, which gives fullscreen windows, at least 720p and very customizable controls/audio. Alas, even Ultimate Z-Doom isn't perfect; the perfect version of DooM is a Z-doom with the Panasonic 3DO's music in it; the high-quality audio redone by a live band(name sadly unkown) is amazing. I'd still recommend Ultimate Z-DooM, but we REALLY need a modern version of this.			"

												As you can tell by my profile picture, I like this game. I play it again every few years. It's really amazing to see how different first person shooters were when id software was the only one's doing it and had nothing to compare to. You don't look up or down, aiming in the vertical plane is done automatically. There is no commanding officer shouting orders through a radio. The story is told in the instruction manual and by a paragraph at the end of each episode. No need to reload weapons. DOOM was made with one goal in mind: shoot everything and anything that moves. Usually when you play a really old game, you think about how good it would be with modern graphics, but with DOOM there is some sort of uniqueness about its graphics, you don't seem to mind. Bottom Line: DOOM is absolute carnage. A must play.			"

But not any more (said cowering under his desk)But seriouslyIts still got an active modding comunity there are tons of extra maps you can get at no cost if you know where to look if you get doom builder make your own level challenge your friends.Best part is you dont need to know how to use any code script etc...If you are craving some type of zombie mode if your a cod zombie lover  just create a level with  a ♥♥♥♥ load of enermys and see how long you can last  or try the NUTS wad trust me its fun to play. This version is a bit lacking in graphical style but what do you expect from the early 90s i think its just a beuatiful as when i first played it and you get that nostalgic feeling There are some source ports that  will add extra pretty grafics as well as up down look and jumps and other things  another like the selfie stick lmao i mean ok its not how i rember playing DOOM  but its worth a go if the orginals a bit dated for you or you feel like spiceing things up :)but i do encourage you if you have not played this befor to play the original i urge you if you havent played it or if you have in the past to get this awsome game if you do not own it as its soo much fun especialy if you and a few friends death match or co op the campaigne on nightmare dificulty another reason to buy are the levels are almost not scripted like cod and BF you can go almost any where aslong as you have found the key :)the levels are well crafted and they have secrets filled of demons or goodys :)OH AND A BIG P.Syou call of duty and battlefield fan boys should have to salute and bow down to this demon slaying bad ♥♥♥ that is DOOM GUY!!!!coz if DOOM didnt exsist neither will cod or BFpeace out guys hope you like my review :)			"

												Different light levels, full texture mapped environment, stairs and elevators, all in a 3D world (kind of).What seems completely irrelevant for today standards, was absolutely mind blowing in 1993, and changed the FPS industry forever.Now, let's look at the game from a 21st century perspective. Is it still a good game? Yes, it is. DOOM, the game that set the world afire It may not be the best game ever (some would say I'm wrong) but it's insane that, 23 years after it's release, DOOM is still a really fun game, with a fast paced action that is hard to find nowadays. Enemies are braindead (just like every other game from the 90's) and most of them aren't any threat individually, but when you have 30 of them in your face, things start to get really complicated very quickly, and if you don't have the necessary reaction speed, you're dead. As simple as that.The story isn't anything great, but honestly I wasn't expecting that kind of ending (I won't spoil it ;)Another thing is the community. This game probably has one of the biggest modding communities of all time, having thousands of maps, mods and TCs.Play it. You probably will need a source port, since DOSBox doesn't work very well. There's a lot to choose from.Chocolate Doom if you want the MS-DOS experience.ZDoom if you want the original graphics but with high resoutions. EDIT: With the pain of my soul, I must inform that ZDoom deveploment stopped. I wouldn't rely on it anymore.GZDoom, Zandronum or Doomsday if you want OpenGL Support.Those are just a few, but they're the best ones in my opinion.PS: All of you people worried that new generations don't appreciate these gems, hope isn't lost! I'm 16!			"

												I actually never played too much doom as a child, but i had the snes port of it, and after playing the pc version, there is no doubt in my mind that not because of nostalgia, this is one of the greatest first person shooter you can play. So much content, and the fact that you never worry about how you are going to get to the very end. you worry about IF you can, its got a great challange and even modern FPS's cant compete with the amount of fun i have gotten from this game. the only contender to this feeling is the dead space series. (which i highly recommend) Its just a great value for a great game, that any action fan should play at least once.			"

												John Stalvern waited. The lights above him blinked and sparked out of the air. There were demons in the base. He didn’t see them, but had expected them now for years. His warnings to Cernel Joson were not listenend to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.John was a space marine for fourteen years. When he was young he watched the spaceships and he said to dad “I want to be on the ships daddy.”Dad said “No! You will BE KILL BY DEMONS”There was a time when he believed him. Then as he got oldered he stopped. But now in the space station base of the UAC he knew there were demons.“This is Joson” the radio crackered. “You must fight the demons!”So John gotted his palsma rifle and blew up the wall.“HE GOING TO KILL US” said the demons“I will shoot at him” said the cyberdemon and he fired the rocket missiles. John plasmaed at him and tried to blew him up. But then the ceiling fell and they were trapped and not able to kill.“No! I must kill the demons” he shoutedThe radio said “No, John. You are the demons”And then John was a zombie.			"

												Fix : You will love this game if you buy it but this does not run on steam so you will need to modify some files to get this  game up and running, there is a easy way to get this game working, go to google and search doomsday engine and just install then find your Doom.wad and play it.      Review : This game is really good its fast fun and easy I recommend getting brutal doom the mod, it will advance the graphics and add more difficulties, even with out the mod still a fun game and with the doomsday engine it allows you to move your crosshair. What makes this game fun in 2016 is the pixil graphics from the 80s/90s its also extremely addicting for its age, I know it says 0.3 hours but I have spent hours using the doomsday engine thats why i dont have any hours in this game (on steam)      Note : If you have a good pc and wanting to spend 60 bucks check out Doom 2016 it may not look appealling but it has the old style with 2016 graphics it is amazing just give it a try!       If you found this useful put a useful rating on this review.			"

												You should help your child climax and experience the joys, sensation and relief of Doom. This is very important. You should teach them to help you play Doom and do the same for them. Explain Doom to them. Tell them how good it feels for boys and girls to blast aliens in space, that shooting aliens is a pleasurable feeling in their bodies that they need to understand & experience and that they need to know how to bring it about with a partner. If they already play Doom, show them how to complete it to climax if they have not discovered it yet. If they do not really know how to play Doom, show them how and demonstrate yourself doing it. Tell them it's normal and healthy and they should do it to get release from real world struggles. A child is not stupid-but often ignorant due to lack of information. Inform them! Doom can be scary to a child, it is a powerful experience they may not have had yet. You must guide them and explain that it won't hurt them, and that it is even good for them!			"

												DOOM is one of the greatest, if not the greatest FPS game to ever be made. It's level design, finding secrets, the challenge, it's all there. Installing mods and multiplayer is fairly easy once you get the hang of it. If you are one of the people who complains about the graphics, and the gameplay, then get the BRUTAL DOOM mod. It makes the game twice as cool and a bit easier on the eyes. A solid 9/10 would *umpf* again.			"

												This is my favorite game of all time. Not my favorite FPS of all time, My absolute favorite. This game was a technical marvel of its time. If you take the SNES verision of this game and put it next to the PC version, you will see that PC blows console out of the water(As usual).  Now that we have all of the tech and bashing out of the way lets get into the actual game! You are an unnamed space marine for the UAC. You are stationed on one of Mar's moons on a base that has been attacked by the horrors of hell. Enough story I want to shoot some demons! As soon as you press new game, choose which episode you want to play, and which difficulty you want to take on hell with, you are immediately dropped into E1M1, The Hanger, with pistol in hand with demon zombies to kill. There is no health regeneration in this game, no M4 carbine with unlimited ammo, no automatic checkpoints, and no hand holding what so ever. As soon as the level starts you are on your own to kill and explore. That is the beauty of this game there is no restriction on where you can go. If you see an area with bad guys outside? You can go there. You see a chain saw and you want it more than anything in the world? Look for a wall to open and go get it and find some meat! The gameplay is the best thing about this game. The primal satisfaction from seeing that enemy go down in a bloody gorey mess from the blast of your shot gun is like no other. The story is there, but it never really matters that much. John Carmack, the lead programmer for the game, has stated this hilarious phrase, ""Story in a game is like a story in a porn movie. It's expected to be there, but it's not that important."" The music in this game is absolutely phenomenal. At DOOM's gate, the music from E1M1, is ingrained into every person who has played this game. The music is down and dirty metal. It fits the game very well. All in all, I would absolutely recommend this game. For $5 dollars this game is a no brainer. Especially when it's on sale for a little more than a buck. Now that the sales pitch and review of this game is done, I will have to say that the MS DOS port does not look good in today's standards. I do recommend that you pick up a source port so that you can have the game support your native resolution, mouse support, mods, etc. It's not hard to install or set up, it just consits of finding the source port, I recommend Zandronum, copy the WAD from the location you installed and paste it into your source port. That's it!I may be a 16 year old kid, but I see what this game has done to the FPS genre. I love all of the mechanics of this game and will always be coming back to this game for years to come.Thank you so much for bearing with me for this long review,Uncle Teo(P.S. Don't judge my hours played I have played this a lot with a source port that doesn't keep track of my hours)			"

												There's not a whole lot to be said about DOOM that hasn't been said beforeIt's a great game. With all the secrets, and enemies to annihilate. Small choice of weapons, but that's no problem.Four episodes with 7 missions each, 8 if you count the boss battle at the end of each episode.To this day DOOM still looks good.It'll run on just about anything with a processor and graphics card.The game doesn't cost a lot. It'd be a good decision to just buy the complete package.There is Satanic imagery for anyone who's a wuss and is worried about that - wouldn't want you to cry if you reach that cyberdemon.As this is a older game it'll be running on DOSBox, I had to change my output type to OpenGL but after that everything was smooth sailing. No framerate issues here.Lighting can be a bit weird in certain places, but it adds to the atmosphere.It's a good FPS give it a try if you haven't played it yet.			"

Call of Duty. Blek. This game tops that in every way, you fight men and demons, imps and get badass weapons, inluding the one, the only, the BFG. Big friendly giant my ♥♥♥, BIG ♥♥♥♥IN GUN rules. And it gets even better in the sequel. This is the game series so badass they made the final boss a wall and it was kickass.So pick this up.

												IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: The game is a port from DOS. Some people who have purchased this version of Doom have experienced a problem where the game's colors turn into a chaotic mess. There are, however, mods out there that you can use to fix this problem if you happen to use this version of the game. Now on to the main review.I made a review for this game a while back. However, I don't believe that review did the game justice, so here's a more proper review.First of all, if you're new at Doom and are eager to try it out, you'll find this review useful. Anyone who is familiar with this game already knows what made Doom a work of art, so this review is for anyone who wants to try it.What Makes this Game so Special?The game was made in '93, a time when video games were much different from today. Far different. Long before Doom, it was commonplace to be making games about shooting aliens from a space ship, and quite a few other interesting titles that I won't both going into. What you need to know is that when Doom came out in '93, it had new ideas and innovations for gaming, or more specifically, the shooting genre.Now to make things clear, Doom obviously isn't the first FPS (Wolfenstein, duh). Doom is, however, a game that managed to define the FPS genre as a gritty, in-your-face, gut-spilling type of world where your annihilate your enemies with firepower. It had that hostile atmosphere to it, one that emphasized on survival through violence as you shoot through wave after wave of bloodthirsty, demonic aliens. Fun side note: the game also had multiplayer. Then there was the game's engine, which allowed the developers to create all kinds of amazing levels, many of which also featured puzzle-solving, which we'll get more into later.So yeah, that's what makes this game so special, even to this day.How is the Gameplay?Pretty simple and straightforward, actually. Run around with a gun, shoot things, collect items, and look for a way out of the level to progress to the next. That's basically the concept of every single FPS game after Doom, so it's not rocket science. That doesn't mean that this simple concept is bad, because like any FPS, the fun comes from blasting the living ♥♥♥♥ out of the enemies that dare oppose you. Doom is able to make this concept fun because of the gore and violence (which is able to make the game's atmosphere look hostile), the variety of weapons, the challenge, and the constant supply of enemies for you to destroy. That is the basic formula for any singleplayer FPS game that is fun and enjoyable. You can use a wide variety of weapons from the shotgun, the pistol, the plasma gun, and a whole bunch of other weapons. You will be ambushed by swarms of demonic hordes ready to tear you to shreds, and the only thing that's going to keep you alive is your trigger finger and a gun, rocket launcher, or BFG 9000. You'll be forced to solve puzzles and run around the map in search of keys to unlock doors, always on the constant look out for more ambushes. There will also be a few horror elements in this game, none of which are terrifying, to be honest, but if your threshold isn't too tough, chances are you'll get a good scare from time to time. Just about all of the game's horror elements involve forcing you to go through dark corridors in order to progress through the next level, so you never know what kind of monsters will be attacking you. Other horror elements include ambushes from tight spaces. Is it terrifying? No, because you can fight back and eliminate the threat. Can it be creepy and give you a good scare? Yes, but only if you're the type of person who doesn't play many horror games, or none at all. There's also a good variety of enemies for you to kill.With all of these features combined into the game, it's no wonder that Doom made a hit.What is the Story?The story isn't interesting, but that's not what makes the game amazing. Besides, the story itself, even though it uses the same old cliches you've seen in many movies, is perfectly fitting for Doom. You play as a space Marine, who is basically a badass that isn't scared of anything. You and your squad were sent to the Phobos moonbase near Mars in response to a distress call. However, your entire squad is brutally killed by demonic monsters, and as the only survivor, your only choice is to fight your way out of the mess you got yourself into. It's the perfect story that fits a game where your survival depends on gritty combat.What Else Does this Game Offer?This game has a lot to offer besides the base game. Doom has always had a large, dedicated community that constantly made mods for it, and it still does today. There are tons of mods out there that will interest you. For example, are you looking for a mod that makes the game look a bit neater, contains more gore, and gives your gun iron sights? There's Brutal Doom. Do you want a mod that allows Doom to stay in its more traditional roots, but still adds in some new content? There's tons of them out there (Google is your friend if you want to find out more of these mods). There's tons of other mods that add in their own spin on the game, so you've got yourself a gold mine here. Is There Anything Bad About this Game?First of all, if you were to criticize Doom, chances are its fanbase will get offended and start chasing after you like ravenous wolves. But from my own honest, unbiased opinion, is there anything bad about Doom at all?For me, the answer is no, but that is because I enjoy playing this game, and its mods. The base game itself is very challenging, and if there is one, amazing thing that Doom got right, it was making an FPS (one of the first FPS games, mind you) that actually made you feel like you playing a fun, worthwhile game. There are too many shooters out there these days that end up being mediocre pieces of crap that think shelling out a load of meaningless, wasteful DLCs is the way to go (not that I hate DLC, I just hate it when devs rely on it because they're too lazy to actually add substance to the game, and instead give you a piece of crap where the only thing that matters is cosmetics). Let me elaborate on this. Is Doom linear? yes. Does that mean Doom is bad? No, because Doom's linear gameplay allows you to explore as you progress. Some shooting games are so stale and pale that they treat you like a complete dumb ♥♥♥ by telling you where to go without ever giving you a chance to explore. Can you argue that the game is bad because of its graphics? No, you can't at all. Yes, this game is from the '90s. Yes, it has visible pixels. But if you ask me, Doom's visuals don't look bad at all. I believe the visual style of this game gives you a retro feel (obviously because it's old, duh), but more than that, it shows you how simplicity in a game can be incredibly fun.So as far as the game itself is concerned, Doom isn't bad. I will, however, argue that this port on Steam is bad and unstable. I want to actually be able to paly a game that I can see, not one where the screen gets messed up with a chaotic collection of red, blue and green colors. That is why I ended up using ZDoom so I can play the old game with full classic settings and actually have it in working order.Also, if there is one thing you can complain about Doom, it's the fanbase, one that is filled with a bunch of tryhard hipsters constantly ♥♥♥♥♥ing at each other over which mod is better. Then there's the other group of deadbeats out there that feel like they're special because all they play is the unmodded, classic version, and go on a ranting spree against anyone who plays the game with mods. Seriously, whatever happened to playing the game however the hell you wanted to play it without having everyone freaking out like morons? SMH.Conclusion:You like shooters? Wanna try out an epic classic? Buy this game, but be warned of a few possible problems you may run into with the visuals. Mods can fix it tho.			"

												Honestly this game was the best FPS I've played ever, just succeeded by Doom II: Hell On Earth. You must use GZDOOM to play this since the Dosbox kinda sucks with the framerate cap and compatibility. Overall this was an awesome, badass, fast paced first person shooter and really not much more, not to put it down but to praise it over it's simplicity and retro shooting style. Would rate 10 Cyberdemons out of 10.			"

												I may only have five minutes of playtime, but that was the best five minutes of my life.But for real, Doom is an amazing game that's stood the test of time better than any other game out there; the community is still highly active and the mod scene is still going strong after 23 years, people are still speed running the game and Doomworld holds Cacowards every single year to showcase the best mods and wads of the year. You just don't see that kind of activity with many other games from the 90's (except for Quake). I mean, the game outsold Windows '95 and was promoted by Bill Gates! Everyone knows Doom, and I'm glad to say that it's my favorite game of all time.If you want to play Doom, download a modern source port like (G)ZDoom or Zandronum, play through the game vanilla, and then dive into the ocean of mods and wads. There are great mods like Smooth Doom, Reelism, Project MSX, Samsara, Fractal Doom, DemonSteele, and Doom64 EX. If Ultimate Doom, Doom 2, TNT: Evilution, and The Plutonia Experiment didn't have enough maps for you, then you've got great wads and mega-wads like UAC Ultra, Pirate Doom, Scythe 1/2, Alien Vendetta, Speed of Doom, Claustrophobia 1024, Plutonia 2, Community Chest #1-4, the recent Japanese Community Project, and so many more. Oh, and you can't forget nuts.wad!And don't forget to celebrate Doom's birthday on December 10th by playing Doom and shooting the Cyber Demon until it dies. Cheers, Doomguy.			"

												I've been playing this game and its sequel Doom II - Hell On Earth since they came out, so ignore my play time here. Buying this gets you the DOOM.WAD (and DOOM2.WAD for its sequel) which you can then use with a source port, and with a modern machine it's pretty much the only way to play. Choose between enhancements galore with ports like GZDoom, or go with a more vanilla experience with the likes of Chocolate Doom.The first game probably had the best level design of the series, and yes I'm including the latest game of the series in that comparison too, and is worth a play through for that fact alone. None of the dull, boring corridors you're expected to fight in these days. Doom has entire facilities to explore with no correct way to go about it. Spending a bit of extra time exploring will often reward you with secrets.Just don't forget to save often. Being able to manually save your game whenever you want, something that modern games don't seem to bother with these days, gives you much more freedom in your approach to exploration. Scared to jump into an acid pool to see if there's a secret? Save the game then! None of this save-point rubbish that we have to put up with in today's games.If you haven't played Doom you're missing out on not only witnessing an important part of digial history, but playing an awesome game that still stands up today too.

												Probably my favorite FPS of all time (if you can't tell). Just a few things I want to add:1: I think the Playstation version is the best version of Doom. It has IMHO the best soundtrack of the bunch, it's dark ambient music that makes the game feel completely different than the PC versions. Not only that, the entire game is darker, and some areas have dynamic lighting, adding to the mood. If you are interesting in playing a version of Doom that makes you feel a bit more connected to the isolated atmosphere, I highly recommand playing the PSX version. If you don't have a PSX, google Doom PSX TC, a total conversion that allows you to play the PSX version on PC. 2: If you liked my last recommendation, I also highly recommend Doom 64 EX, it has the same mind behind the ambient soundtrack from the PSX version, but with all new monsters and levels exclusive to the N64 version. Again this game is dark, isolated, and gives a completely different feel than the original PC versions.			"

												Hundreds of major media outlets have already described Doom's influence on the greater games industry. Books have been written about it. It's been made into a feature film, had two major reboots, and bears a relatively small but massively dedicated community, consisting of people who have been playing for 23 years. I am one of those people. I feel as if I have done everything there is to be done with Doom, having beaten every episode, played hundreds if not thousands of add-on WAD files, *made* several add-on WADs myself (many gameplay patches and one new level), and become an influential person in the community myself.It should be obvious how much I recommend this game. Buy it and you will never, ever run out of things to do.			"

												This game is great without a doubt and I believe everyone should give it a try. But there are some things you need to note before paying for it: 1) this is the DOS version of the game so it includes DOSbox 2)DOSbox hates running on modern operating systems 3)DOSbox runs like ♥♥♥ if you don't know how to edit config files. So how do you fix these problems? Simple really, download a source port of your choice, there are many out there and they make the game outstanding. I prefer Zdoom because it doesn't mess with the visuals and keeps the feel of vanilla doom. So do yourself a favor and buy the DOOM Classic complete collection, download a source port, and last but not least download the master levels patch so you can play the master levels as an episode for doom 2 (this was the easiest way I could find)			"

												IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: The game is a port from DOS. Some people who have purchased this version of Doom have experienced a problem where the game's colors turn into a chaotic mess. There are, however, mods out there that you can use to fix this problem if you happen to use this version of the game. Now on to the main review.I made a review for this game a while back. However, I don't believe that review did the game justice, so here's a more proper review.First of all, if you're new at Doom and are eager to try it out, you'll find this review useful. Anyone who is familiar with this game already knows what made Doom a work of art, so this review is for anyone who wants to try it.What Makes this Game so Special?The game was made in '93, a time when video games were much different from today. Far different. Long before Doom, it was commonplace to be making games about shooting aliens from a space ship, and quite a few other interesting titles that I won't both going into. What you need to know is that when Doom came out in '93, it had new ideas and innovations for gaming, or more specifically, the shooting genre.Now to make things clear, Doom obviously isn't the first FPS (Wolfenstein, duh). Doom is, however, a game that managed to define the FPS genre as a gritty, in-your-face, gut-spilling type of world where your annihilate your enemies with firepower. It had that hostile atmosphere to it, one that emphasized on survival through violence as you shoot through wave after wave of bloodthirsty, demonic aliens. Fun side note: the game also had multiplayer. Then there was the game's engine, which allowed the developers to create all kinds of amazing levels, many of which also featured puzzle-solving, which we'll get more into later.So yeah, that's what makes this game so special, even to this day.How is the Gameplay?Pretty simple and straightforward, actually. Run around with a gun, shoot things, collect items, and look for a way out of the level to progress to the next. That's basically the concept of every single FPS game after Doom, so it's not rocket science. That doesn't mean that this simple concept is bad, because like any FPS, the fun comes from blasting the living ♥♥♥♥ out of the enemies that dare oppose you. Doom is able to make this concept fun because of the gore and violence (which is able to make the game's atmosphere look hostile), the variety of weapons, the challenge, and the constant supply of enemies for you to destroy. That is the basic formula for any singleplayer FPS game that is fun and enjoyable. You can use a wide variety of weapons from the shotgun, the pistol, the plasma gun, and a whole bunch of other weapons. You will be ambushed by swarms of demonic hordes ready to tear you to shreds, and the only thing that's going to keep you alive is your trigger finger and a gun, rocket launcher, or BFG 9000. You'll be forced to solve puzzles and run around the map in search of keys to unlock doors, always on the constant look out for more ambushes. There will also be a few horror elements in this game, none of which are terrifying, to be honest, but if your threshold isn't too tough, chances are you'll get a good scare from time to time. Just about all of the game's horror elements involve forcing you to go through dark corridors in order to progress through the next level, so you never know what kind of monsters will be attacking you. Other horror elements include ambushes from tight spaces. Is it terrifying? No, because you can fight back and eliminate the threat. Can it be creepy and give you a good scare? Yes, but only if you're the type of person who doesn't play many horror games, or none at all. There's also a good variety of enemies for you to kill.With all of these features combined into the game, it's no wonder that Doom made a hit.What is the Story?The story isn't interesting, but that's not what makes the game amazing. Besides, the story itself, even though it uses the same old cliches you've seen in many movies, is perfectly fitting for Doom. You play as a space Marine, who is basically a badass that isn't scared of anything. You and your squad were sent to the Phobos moonbase near Mars in response to a distress call. However, your entire squad is brutally killed by demonic monsters, and as the only survivor, your only choice is to fight your way out of the mess you got yourself into. It's the perfect story that fits a game where your survival depends on gritty combat.What Else Does this Game Offer?This game has a lot to offer besides the base game. Doom has always had a large, dedicated community that constantly made mods for it, and it still does today. There are tons of mods out there that will interest you. For example, are you looking for a mod that makes the game look a bit neater, contains more gore, and gives your gun iron sights? There's Brutal Doom. Do you want a mod that allows Doom to stay in its more traditional roots, but still adds in some new content? There's tons of them out there (Google is your friend if you want to find out more of these mods). There's tons of other mods that add in their own spin on the game, so you've got yourself a gold mine here. Is There Anything Bad About this Game?First of all, if you were to criticize Doom, chances are its fanbase will get offended and start chasing after you like ravenous wolves. But from my own honest, unbiased opinion, is there anything bad about Doom at all?For me, the answer is no, but that is because I enjoy playing this game, and its mods. The base game itself is very challenging, and if there is one, amazing thing that Doom got right, it was making an FPS (one of the first FPS games, mind you) that actually made you feel like you playing a fun, worthwhile game. There are too many shooters out there these days that end up being mediocre pieces of crap that think shelling out a load of meaningless, wasteful DLCs is the way to go (not that I hate DLC, I just hate it when devs rely on it because they're too lazy to actually add substance to the game, and instead give you a piece of crap where the only thing that matters is cosmetics). Let me elaborate on this. Is Doom linear? yes. Does that mean Doom is bad? No, because Doom's linear gameplay allows you to explore as you progress. Some shooting games are so stale and pale that they treat you like a complete dumb ♥♥♥ by telling you where to go without ever giving you a chance to explore. Can you argue that the game is bad because of its graphics? No, you can't at all. Yes, this game is from the '90s. Yes, it has visible pixels. But if you ask me, Doom's visuals don't look bad at all. I believe the visual style of this game gives you a retro feel (obviously because it's old, duh), but more than that, it shows you how simplicity in a game can be incredibly fun.So as far as the game itself is concerned, Doom isn't bad. I will, however, argue that this port on Steam is bad and unstable. I want to actually be able to paly a game that I can see, not one where the screen gets messed up with a chaotic collection of red, blue and green colors. That is why I ended up using ZDoom so I can play the old game with full classic settings and actually have it in working order.Also, if there is one thing you can complain about Doom, it's the fanbase, one that is filled with a bunch of tryhard hipsters constantly ♥♥♥♥♥ing at each other over which mod is better. Then there's the other group of deadbeats out there that feel like they're special because all they play is the unmodded, classic version, and go on a ranting spree against anyone who plays the game with mods. Seriously, whatever happened to playing the game however the hell you wanted to play it without having everyone freaking out like morons? SMH.Conclusion:You like shooters? Wanna try out an epic classic? Buy this game, but be warned of a few possible problems you may run into with the visuals. Mods can fix it tho.			"

												Get this game.  I did not play this game in the 90's, so my enjoyment of this is not out of nostalgia.  Yeah it's old, but honestly its still one of the most fun games out there, the levels are mazelike and encourage exploration and the combat is fast paced.  The game REALLY shines with the Brutal Doom and Metal Soundtrack mods though, making the game even more fast paced and adrenaline packed, and vastly improving the graphics.  I know people say mods ruin games but why play a game in 240p when you could play it in 1080p?			"

												If you've played the shareware version like crazy and have been dying for more, buying this and/or Doom II will not only satisfy you, it'll give you SO MUCH MORE than you expected. Play it on DOSBox or Chocolate Doom for a classic feel or try it on a modern source port such as GZDoom or Zandronum for added graphical effects. Download a few level packs and mods from the thousands available since the 90's.Doom has an active multiplayer community, It runs on just about anything (new computers, old computers, smartphones, pianos, you name it), and it only costs five bucks. Really, it's hard to come up with reasons why NOT to get this game.			"

												Welcome to paradise...a land where angels are roaming-oh sorry...wrong speech. Ahem...WELCOME TO HELL! A land where demons came out of a portal and killed everyone in a base on Mars (Cause why not let one single man live?) and one lone space marine survior must grab massive guns and shoot anything that stands before him...and getting to the most beautiful planet...Earth. That is BASICALLY the storyline, in this game, there was barely any storyline. This game was meant for men (and women, but mainly men find the attractiveness in retro gore) who just wanted to shoot things and blow stuff up for no absolute reason and have tons of fun. The demons you fight are actually well-designed and so are the levels. This game was made in 1995 and was an instant blast! This was a game where only one kid's parents would allow him to play, so everybody would attempt to be his friend and look to him as the ""cool guy/kid"" and they would hang over at his house and play Doom all...night...long...! I still love this game and have already spent twelve hours into it, and will spend more! This is a childhood memory that won't go away for a very...long...time!Summary: Like retro gore and tons of action with a game that doesn't really have a storyline?...You met your guardian angel!WARNING: I recommend this to teenagers, not to younger children, for this game is quite violent despite the 1995 graphics!

												I love this game. Love it!!!!Doom is the first game I ever got truly addicted to, and still to this day I find myself whipping it up on any format I can get it on.I've had this from the start on Shareware disks of just the first episode, to the full version on PC, Gameboy Advance, N64, iOS, even the RPG version on phone!The game itself is pretty dated now of course, but that doesn't matter. It just doesn't. This game stands up to the test of time, and is just awesome! Gorey before a game could show individually gibbed body parts, and carrying a deep demonic storyline (i say storyline, it has a basic idea of story from A-B but is no feature length movie-esque COD. Nor does it need to be) and is the true Godfather of the FPS.There were a few that came before it to set the standard of the 3D element, but THIS is the one that made the effort! Buy it standalone, or buy it as part of the iD pack and try its predecessors too to see what paved the way to this slice of gaming History. Marvel at pixelated blood spatter as you chainsaw a Pinky Demon between the eyeballs, and then laugh as its body rotates on the spot to face you from every angle you look at it (this was a function that was not developed until Quake, i believe?).Levels are fairly linear - go through a maze of corridors, taking out all foes in your path to collect the keycards to get through the access doors to beat the badassses to destroy the head honcho to save the world. But with loads of guns and loads of ammo and loads of hellish enemies and some proper banging music! Perfect time after time! :DThis game, will ALWAYS be my number one. My first true love. Always.

The weapons have a real kick to them, makes you feel like a badass as you go around killing enemies.   •	I liked how at the end of the levels it showed you a map telling you, where you have been and where you are going to next.•	You can mod the game. Highly recommend you try brutal doom or Project brutality.• I like it how you can see doomguy's face at the bottom of the screen, seeing how he reacts to being shot at or attacked.

Review For Ultimate DoomReview by: SansPros :- Good Gameplay- Old school graphics- lots of modsCons :Review :The Ultimate Doom a.k.a Doom 95. An old school first person shooter from the 90'sIt's a great game with lots of mods for it. You are a space marine by the game ""Doomguy"", and you have been sent to Phobos to investigate the facility after a secret experiments went wrong, and it's now hell on Phobos. You job is to kill the Cyber Demon and close the portal to hell.The game is quite simple, kill everything and get to the end. There are secrets in each level and can give you some weapons earlier than normal.There is a mod called Brutal Doom that gives new weapons, Aiming, extra realistic gore, remasteded music and more. The mod gives Doom a more brutal experience and a ton more fun to play.I grew up with Doom as i child and have always loved it, so i hope this review helps you if, you some day wants to buy the gamesAdditional Infomation :Developer:  id SoftwarePublisher:  GT InteractiveGenre: FPS, Single playerReleased: 30. apr 1995Follow my Curator page :http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6858371/This review is written for :The Panda's Corner "

												Taking no credit away from its genre predecessor, Wolfenstein 3-D, DOOM was the breakthrough game of 1993, and the more influential of id's first- person shooters. Its arsenal of powerful guns (namely the shotgun and BFG), intense level of gore and perfect balance of adrenaline-soaked action and exploration kept this gamer riveted for years. Initially a shareware product on PC, DOOM also offered the first multiplayer death- matches via LAN. Doom is creepy, atmospheric, with a sense of impending dread that always seems to be just around the next corner or behind that door. There couldn't have been a better name for the game. cod is better lol♥♥♥♥vault 101/10			"

												Get this game.  I did not play this game in the 90's, so my enjoyment of this is not out of nostalgia.  Yeah it's old, but honestly its still one of the most fun games out there, the levels are mazelike and encourage exploration and the combat is fast paced.  The game REALLY shines with the Brutal Doom and Metal Soundtrack mods though, making the game even more fast paced and adrenaline packed, and vastly improving the graphics.  I know people say mods ruin games but why play a game in 240p when you could play it in 1080p?			"

!!Important note!! Doom doesn’t work on my windows 10 laptop it crashes at the start, but it is easily fixable, you can download a launcher called zdoom, which is free and you will be able to easily get the game up and running on it. There is a link below to zdoom.   What I liked about Doom •	The game has an awesome soundtrack.•	There are many secrets throughout the levels to be found.  •	The monsters in the game were pretty cool to fight. •	Awesome levels. My favourite chapter in the game is Inferno•	A great arsenal of weapons. The shotgun and the chainsaw were my favourite weapons to use. The weapons have a real kick to them, makes you feel like a badass as you go around killing enemies.   •	I liked how at the end of the levels it showed you a map telling you, where you have been and where you are going to next.•	You can mod the game. Highly recommend you try brutal doom or Project brutality.• I like it how you can see doomguy's face at the bottom of the screen, seeing how he reacts to being shot at or attacked. What I disliked or was disappointed with •	Chapter four isn’t that good. A very difficult chapter, especially at the start.My conclusion Doom was one of the first video games I ever played, I have fond memories of it. It is a brilliant first person shooter and made even better with brutal doom or project brutality. I highly recommend it.  83/100Zdoom http://zdoom.org/Downloadbrutal doom http://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom "

												I'm sorry, but as far as I'm concerned there is absolutely no reason AT ALL why anyone should not have this game in their Steam library. You do not know fear until you are wandering around a darkened maze of corridors, armed with one shotgun shell, with the only sounds you hear are that of very early MIDI music and the faint groans and growls of whatever is locked up down there with you and then all of a sudden you turn a corner only to ♥♥♥♥ your pants at the site of a pixelated demon that wants to murder you and dance over your corpse once done so.

												The original DOOM still holds up from a game play perspective to this day. I generally play it in ZDOOM, so you won't see many hours logged on my Steam account, but DOOM still manages to be fast and tense, despite its simple controls. Newer games could learn a thing or two from DOOM. A game doesn't have to be slow-paced in order for it to be scary. The level designs don't pull any punches, though. Some of the levels in DOOM are freaking massive.			"

												The only reasons for not getting this game are: if you can't stand outdated graphics, if you dislike corridoor FPS, if you demand realism, if you are a specific type of religious person.The only reason why you should get this game: not a single glaring gameplay flaw. (Use Doom Legacy)There are many other reasons, the game is fun and challenging, atmosphere is great, there are some puzzles, world records to beat, but these days gameplay mechanics are so messed up in most games, that the primary reason I keep getting back to Doom is to take a rest from cussing at the game.Although this game has history with some public shooting incidents, sports heavy metal music and you basically play an alternate to Jesus, this is not Postal or Hatred. Romero had originally planned to give the story a much greater importance, but for whatever reason, it did not end up the way it was visioned in The Doom Bible. The final product is a pure shooting gallery and the only objective is to have fun. Finally, how you take it or what you do with it is you problem.			"

												No game has ever changed an industry like DOOM has, nor has a game delivered so much fun.STORYUnfortunately, there's not much to DOOM's plot. All you need to know is that Hell has taken over Mars and it's moons, and you are the last space marine alive on Mars' moon of Phobos. The story hardly progresses and when it does, it only appears through text screens. So, if you're in it for the story, you won't find much here, that's for sure.GAMEPLAYThis is DOOM's main strength, and the main reason you should play the game. DOOM utilises the old-school mechanics of shooters, with health kits and multiple weapons to carry. Your objective in DOOM is to reach the end of each level whilst eliminating monsters, receiving powerups and activating doors and switches. DOOM's gameplay is very simple and can be understood by any player. Enemy choice and enemy positioning is very creative in DOOM, with there being multiple types of enemy, each one being very cleverly designed. Enemies usually appear in groups of 5-30, which can make the game a real challenge. As you'd expect, there's plenty of ways to dispose with these enemies, with weapons ranging from shotguns to chainsaws. All weapons are very useful and well designed. Level design is another outstanding attribute of DOOM. Levels never feel to maze-like or too linear, which is still a perfect match today. Level design is creative and often gives the player a real challenge. Levels are also scattered with secret areas, which reward the player for exploring the level design and wanting to find new things.GRAPHICS/VISUALS/EFFECTSSome will instantly forget about DOOM when they see it's cheap attempts at 3D graphics, but those affect the gameplay in no way whatsoever. However, DOOM's designs are still amazing, everything from box art to level textures are well designed.CONCLUSIONDOOM is a simple run and gun shooter, however it's sheer fun and enjoyment surpasses any flaw and makes it a game for anyone. 10/10, a game that anyone can enjoy and simply understand.

												What else is there to say about Doom? If you haven't played it you should.Doom is the forefather of all modern first-person shooters. Its controls are tight, its level design remains some of the best ever achieved in the industry, its music is legendary, and the shotgun blast remains iconic in the world of shooters.The story is simple, but standard for 1993 games. It begins in the Hangar of the Phobos moon base as the Doomguy fights his way through the forces of hell before arriving on the lost Deimos base. He has to fight his way through even tough challenges here and take down the vile Cyberdemon before descending into Hell itself.The first nine levels of Doom were released as shareware in 1993. It set a benchmark that future games would dream of reaching. It also had one of the first modding scenes in PC gaming.Speaking of mods, one of the downsides to Doom, especially the Steam version, is that the controls and settings haven't aged all that well. Thus, I'd recommend using a launcher. I personally use GZDoom, which you can find HERE[www.osnanet.de].There are other mods that add to the already awesome and timeless gameplay of Doom, specifically the BRUTAL DOOM MOD. This mod adds additional shooting gameplay and a whole lot more blood to the game.If you are a gamer. Specifically a shooter gamer, you absolurely cannot do much better than Doom.Further information about Doom can be found in this video:

												I'm sorry, but as far as I'm concerned there is absolutely no reason AT ALL why anyone should not have this game in their Steam library. You do not know fear until you are wandering around a darkened maze of corridors, armed with one shotgun shell, with the only sounds you hear are that of very early MIDI music and the faint groans and growls of whatever is locked up down there with you and then all of a sudden you turn a corner only to ♥♥♥♥ your pants at the site of a pixelated demon that wants to murder you and dance over your corpse once done so.

												Talk about a trip to the past of PC gaming. If you're a fan of FPS games and haven't played this ancient relic, give it a try and see how much the genre has evolved, over the ages. The game still holds up quite well today, and I find it much better than a lot of the modern-day FPS games. Though if you want a more enhanced and optimal experience, download one of the many source ports. I recommend ZDoom/GZDoom, but everyone does have their own tastes. Just please don't use DOSBox, unless you're that much of a purist.If you're up for a challenge, go download Brutal Doom. That mod revamps a lot of the game while keeping the Doom feeling intact. Also, flipping the bird at a Cyberdemon is OH SO! satisfying...until he starts blasting twice the BOOM! at you.			"

												I love this game. Love it!!!!Doom is the first game I ever got truly addicted to, and still to this day I find myself whipping it up on any format I can get it on.I've had this from the start on Shareware disks of just the first episode, to the full version on PC, Gameboy Advance, N64, iOS, even the RPG version on phone!The game itself is pretty dated now of course, but that doesn't matter. It just doesn't. This game stands up to the test of time, and is just awesome! Gorey before a game could show individually gibbed body parts, and carrying a deep demonic storyline (i say storyline, it has a basic idea of story from A-B but is no feature length movie-esque COD. Nor does it need to be) and is the true Godfather of the FPS.There were a few that came before it to set the standard of the 3D element, but THIS is the one that made the effort! Buy it standalone, or buy it as part of the iD pack and try its predecessors too to see what paved the way to this slice of gaming History. Marvel at pixelated blood spatter as you chainsaw a Pinky Demon between the eyeballs, and then laugh as its body rotates on the spot to face you from every angle you look at it (this was a function that was not developed until Quake, i believe?).Levels are fairly linear - go through a maze of corridors, taking out all foes in your path to collect the keycards to get through the access doors to beat the badassses to destroy the head honcho to save the world. But with loads of guns and loads of ammo and loads of hellish enemies and some proper banging music! Perfect time after time! :DThis game, will ALWAYS be my number one. My first true love. Always.

!!Important note!! Doom doesn’t work on my windows 10 laptop it crashes at the start, but it is easily fixable, you can download a launcher called zdoom, which is free and you will be able to easily get the game up and running on it. There is a link below to zdoom.   What I liked about Doom •	The game has an awesome soundtrack.•	There are many secrets throughout the levels to be found.  •	The monsters in the game were pretty cool to fight. •	Awesome levels. My favourite chapter in the game is Inferno•	A great arsenal of weapons. The shotgun and the chainsaw were my favourite weapons to use. The weapons have a real kick to them, makes you feel like a badass as you go around killing enemies.   •	I liked how at the end of the levels it showed you a map telling you, where you have been and where you are going to next.•	You can mod the game. Highly recommend you try brutal doom or Project brutality.• I like it how you can see doomguy's face at the bottom of the screen, seeing how he reacts to being shot at or attacked. What I disliked or was disappointed with •	Chapter four isn’t that good. A very difficult chapter, especially at the start.My conclusion Doom was one of the first video games I ever played, I have fond memories of it. It is a brilliant first person shooter and made even better with brutal doom or project brutality. I highly recommend it.  83/100Zdoom http://zdoom.org/Downloadbrutal doom http://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom "

												Takes a fair bit of modding to get it working well on Windows 10, but when it's done the game is just as good as it was in 1993. I recommend looking up how to edit the correct files for the game, because without a fair bit of editing the game's pretty much unplayable. Overall, give it a go if you're willing to put some initial effort into getting it working, because after that it plays fine.			"

												I'll start by saying that I have no nostalgia for this game. My very first experience with Doom was playing the shareware demo for the first time in late 2015, about 20 years after its release, or 2 decades. I was also using the Chocolate Doom Sourceport, which emulates vanilla Doom as closely as possible, so no fancy graphics changes or mouselook or anything of the sort. All I did to the game was rebind the controls to WSAD + Mouse, disable the ENDOOM screen, and had Patch93's Roland SC-55 Soundfont installed. That said, this is easily one of the greatest games I have ever played. Not only does it stand the test of time, but it has aged like fine wine, and I'd imagine it's almost better nowadays than before, where modern shooters are always pushing for better graphics, greater realism, and less of the high speed arcadey action that makes Doom so fun.Movement is fast, fluid, and fun. There is no crouching or jumping, but with the way the game is designed such mechanics would only break the game. The game is balanced around constant movement, whether it's dodging enemy projectiles, picking up ammo/hp, or crossing rivers of toxic waste. You don't stop to reload or take cover, you're always on the move.The weapons are all rather balanced and extremely fun to play with, except maybe the pistol and fists (though, in the defense of the stock melee fists, the berserk powerup makes them incredibly fun and they get replaced by the chainsaw later anyways). The shotgun in particular is extremely versatile and useful throughout the game and is one of the best shotguns in video games, and the BFG 9000 is one of the best video game weapons ever. The lack of reload makes sure that combat stays fast paced while the delay between each fire balances it out and keeps you on the move. The weapons (aside from the aforementioned two weaker ones) all feel like they really pack a punch, capable of killing multiple enemies in one or two shots. The sounds and animations, even though they’re not particularly high quality by today’s standards, still sound and look pleasant and add to the punchy-ness of the weapons (if that makes sense).The enemy design is extremely colorful, creative, memorable, and of course, disturbing. The Cacodemon is a perfect example of this; a red monster with a large spherical body that floats slowly through the air, crowned with horns, and possessing a single green eye over a large mouth which is persistently twisted into an evil grin showing a series of nasty teeth and a bluish interior. And, to top it off, let me quote this wiki description of the Cacodemon’s death animation: “When killed, they let out a whimpering moan and fall to the ground, splitting open like a burst pustule and spewing copious amounts of blue blood and intestines that flow forth to reveal their bared brains, while their sole eye pops out of its socket. Also, some of its horns break.” How do they come up with these monster ideas?These monsters remain fun to play against despite their seemingly basic AI, as often you will have to combat multiple enemies at a time, dodging their projectiles and staying on the move as you whittle down their numbers with blasts from a shotgun. An interesting thing about these monsters’ AI is that they can be tricked into fighting each other. This can usually be accomplished by getting into a position where one monster is in the line of fire of another. The monster, in an attempt to damage you, will hit the one in the line of fire, and the damaged monster will retaliate and attack in revenge without regard. This is a really unique game mechanic, as most games do not give the enemies the ability to hurt each other, much less the ability to retaliate. Monster infighting is a great tactic to use when low on ammo, and it’s just fun to watch two monsters ignore you and fight each other to the death.The level design is complex, sprawling, and loaded with cleverly hidden secrets and alternate paths. Many of the levels here are some of the best out of any video game out there. The replayability value is extremely high with this game because of just how much there is to discover in these levels. You'll still be finding new secrets and even secret exits and secret levels even after replaying this game many, many times. Unlike much of the linear level design of today, this game does not hold your hand and encourages you to go off and explore, and exploration is rewarded with finding goodies such as weapons, ammo, health, armor, or a new path/new exit. The game doesn't point out the secrets directly but rather guides you to them using audio and visual cues. This may be an odd wall texture, or maybe hearing the sound of a door opening far off when you press a switch or button. Sometimes a window may tease a secret behind it, and you'll have to find it using your knowledge of the level. There are even secrets within secrets in many cases (and secrets within secrets within secrets!). Another great thing about the level design is the natural sense of progression it has. You start off in a fully tech-based environment, in the UAC facilities. As the game goes on, the levels become gradually more and more twisted and hellish until everything is either made of stone or meat by the end. You really feel like you've completed a story arc (as simple as it may be).The visuals have aged surprisingly well. 2D sprites for enemies are partially to thank for this, as sprites always look way better than ♥♥♥♥♥♥ early 3D. Another part of why Doom still looks nice today is the textures. They’re low quality, yes, but not in a “blurry vomit of color” kind of way but in a pixely, retro kind of way. I don’t really know how to put it into words. I guess an example might be Deus Ex. Look at screenshots for Deus Ex: the textures are blurry and low res, and the models are low poly and also suffer from having blurry textures over them too. All in all, Deus Ex looks really bad by modern standards (don’t get me wrong though, it’s still a masterpiece game). Doom’s textures and sprites use big pixels that look sharper and cleaner than Deus Ex’s blurry textures. It’s like comparing really good pixel art to a painting behind blurry, smudgy glass. Or something.And the music is just awesome. All of Doom's music was composed by Robert Prince, on a Roland SC-55. I strongly recommend that you find a way to emulate a Roland SC-55’s playback of the soundtrack if you can.  Brandon Blume’s SC-55 recordings for Doom 1 and 2’s soundtracks are compatible with ZDoom and GZDoom, which is probably the easiest and best method of making it work. I didn’t know how to get it to work with Chocolate Doom so I just settled on using Patch93’s SC-55 Soundfont. The actual music is a mix of heavy metal and ambient tracks, drawing inspiration from groups such as Alice in Chains, Metallica, Pantera and Slayer. The tracks add to the atmosphere when they need to, and makes you feel pumped up and ready to kill things when they need to, and overall it’s just a fantastic soundtrack that compliments the game perfectly.Other things of note:The use of toxic barrels in the environment is really cool. Not only can you combat the monsters with your weapons and against each other, but you can use the environment to your advantage against them by shooting barrels and watching them blow up into bits, sometimes creating a chain reaction of barrel explosions.The atmosphere in the game is great, especially in the more hellish levels.The difficulty levels are pretty cleverly named. Much nicer than the typical “Easy, Normal, Hard”The soul sphere’s design is really underrated – a human soul trapped in a blue orb. The first time I came across it I just stared at it for afew minutes, both disturbed and intrigued, and tried to kill it before eventually realizing that it was actually a powerup. Probably my favorite powerup in any game now.TL;DR: 11/10 timeless masterpiece.			"

												What else is there to say about Doom? If you haven't played it you should.Doom is the forefather of all modern first-person shooters. Its controls are tight, its level design remains some of the best ever achieved in the industry, its music is legendary, and the shotgun blast remains iconic in the world of shooters.The story is simple, but standard for 1993 games. It begins in the Hangar of the Phobos moon base as the Doomguy fights his way through the forces of hell before arriving on the lost Deimos base. He has to fight his way through even tough challenges here and take down the vile Cyberdemon before descending into Hell itself.The first nine levels of Doom were released as shareware in 1993. It set a benchmark that future games would dream of reaching. It also had one of the first modding scenes in PC gaming.Speaking of mods, one of the downsides to Doom, especially the Steam version, is that the controls and settings haven't aged all that well. Thus, I'd recommend using a launcher. I personally use GZDoom, which you can find HERE[www.osnanet.de].There are other mods that add to the already awesome and timeless gameplay of Doom, specifically the BRUTAL DOOM MOD. This mod adds additional shooting gameplay and a whole lot more blood to the game.If you are a gamer. Specifically a shooter gamer, you absolurely cannot do much better than Doom.Further information about Doom can be found in this video:

												Welcome to paradise...a land where angels are roaming-oh sorry...wrong speech. Ahem...WELCOME TO HELL! A land where demons came out of a portal and killed everyone in a base on Mars (Cause why not let one single man live?) and one lone space marine survior must grab massive guns and shoot anything that stands before him...and getting to the most beautiful planet...Earth. That is BASICALLY the storyline, in this game, there was barely any storyline. This game was meant for men (and women, but mainly men find the attractiveness in retro gore) who just wanted to shoot things and blow stuff up for no absolute reason and have tons of fun. The demons you fight are actually well-designed and so are the levels. This game was made in 1995 and was an instant blast! This was a game where only one kid's parents would allow him to play, so everybody would attempt to be his friend and look to him as the ""cool guy/kid"" and they would hang over at his house and play Doom all...night...long...! I still love this game and have already spent twelve hours into it, and will spend more! This is a childhood memory that won't go away for a very...long...time!Summary: Like retro gore and tons of action with a game that doesn't really have a storyline?...You met your guardian angel!WARNING: I recommend this to teenagers, not to younger children, for this game is quite violent despite the 1995 graphics!

Mostly everything about this game was different when I played it in the late 90s as a kid from what has come to before, the bloody action horror familiar to old games like Mortal Kombat and ways how it be greater than with its high impact settings. Staying up late at night and raving around in different dark areas looking for hidden secrets and surprising arsensals for the player to survive the level makes hopeless doom addict.While doom kept most pc gamers awake past midnight, the game's single player and deathmatch mode that made it through the doors is worth revisiting hell again!

												From soccer moms to Army Rangers, everyone's heard of Doom. Its name may well be synonymous with gaming controversy itself right beside Grand Theft Auto and E.T. It's one of the few 3D games that can say it's old enough to legally drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, and own a handgun in its home country at the time of writing. For a long time, I wanted to play the game that was so important it was deemed a national treasure of the United States. When I finally did, I didn't regret it for an instant.It goes without saying; Doom is old. You can't crouch, you can't jump, you can't look up or down, and it's not even true 3D - 2.5D, as it was called, unable to stack rooms on top of one another. Pixelated monsters and environments straight out of 1993 look like an absolute mess at the ludicrous speeds the player is capable of and autoaim is a fact of life.Despite how undeniably and understandably aged Doom is, it's still a fantastic game. It offers a healthy list of useful weapons with unique roles and a good variety of enemies that provide a fair challenge each. Valuable first-person shooter skills saw their rise to prominence in the bloodstained halls of the UAC labs and remain engaging twelve years later. Pacing that satisfies and yet leaves the player wanting for more contributes to an addicting game that gives the player control of how fast and how loose they want to fight their way through each demon-infested level.Interesting usage of lighting, pleasing level design, detailed sprites and animations - few frames as they had - and a MIDI soundtrack so powerful you'd expect it to take up more than its 800KB in space all drive home Doom's finely aged experience. Even the stock sound effects that Doom relies upon are employed effectively and continue to make their presence heard in video games to this day.It's no wonder that the first-person shooter genre had the title of ""Doom clone"" when this classic was released. More than two decades after id Software put shooters on the map, Doom is still an absolute treat to play. To those who have yet to see what all the yelling and screaming is about, my recommendation is to take the plunge and start cooking with gas.			"

												This game is simply a beast!The game that started it all!All online fps gaming and all fps gaming in general have as a starting point this game.Even though it's with wolfenstein 3d that the name fps was first used(if i remember correctly), it's with doom that the genre had it's breakthrough.The game still feels really good today:super fun, tons of enemies, great atmosphere, good music and simply non stop action.This ultimate version contains the ""new"" original doom chapter called ""thy flesh consumed"" too.If you are esitant cause the game it's really old and it runs at a resolution simply unbereable to many by today's standards, nothing to worry about, there are mods to increase it to 1080p and many other fixes like the option to move the mouse in all directions(originally in the game you could look only left and right) and 60 fps(originally the game was limited at 35)just google Zdoom mod, it's really easy to install and you can run it through steam too http://steamcommunity.com/app/2280/discussions/0/828934424054379381/ check out the brutal doom mod too!

												Great fun, this game. I do highly recommend it to anyone who is a PC gamer and doesn't hate fun. There's not much story, so don't be expected to be immersed in that, but the game itself is so fun, I feel like a stroy would ruin everything this game acomplishes. If the grahpics are too dated for you to handle, get the Brutal Doom mod. It adds extra gore and better graphics and a verticle axis. That's another thing, this game doesn't have a verticle axis (looking up and down) so don't complain about that. This was 1993, after all. Anyway, a great PC classic and definitely worth a buy, even though it is possible to get it for free.			"

												11/10.I first played this game when I was 6 in 1999 on my dad's copied floppy disc. This game has ingrained the FPS genre inside me from a very young age and I wouldn't have it any other way. The hordes of iconic demons, your extensive arsenal, forboding environments that capture the atmosphere of that spacey hellish theme and the iconic DOOM Guy whom I have idolized for a very long time.- Non-stop action of mowing down demons of various skill- Extremely moddable- Iconic soundtrack by Bobby Prince- This game will literally almost run on anything (even the Macbook's touch bar)- A revolutionary game for it's time that pioneered gaming, popularized the FPS genre to what it is todayThis game is super close to my heart, playing most of the DOOM games up until DOOM 2016 along with replaying more of ID's games, watching the movie (as most hated it I still loved it) and even inking the title on my arm. I cannot fault it, I don't care how biased that is.			"

I use a program called GZDoom for example. There are several other addons that you can use with the Brutal Doom including a visor hud, some graphical enhancement addons, a ""realistic"" type of overhaul for different approach on the gameplay etc. Oh, and the level design is awesome!

There is ♥♥♥♥ ton of serious reviews so i will just give a cheeky guide how to doom.1st step: Install The Ultimate DOOM from your library.2nd step: Install GZdoom port (ye ye it is kind of lame chocolate doom is better for nostalgia cause its the same as it was back in 1993 but GZdoom improves graphics a little bit and gives you vertical cam aswell).3rd step: install some mods for example HDOOM.Get freaked out because of HDOOM.Handle over it.Ok after 2 hours you are getting boner on nude demons with BEEEEWBS. Congrats now you are as weird as the writer of this review. (But seriously if you want to get most fun of this game just play it on GZdoom or Chocolate doom without brutal doom etc. these lower the original difficulty a little bit) Oh i almost forgot this is a perfect FPS			"

												The Ultimate Doom is simply an upgraded version of the Original Doom game. I’m going to go ahead and tell you now, there is a good chance of getting eye cancer after play this game, yes it looked that horrendous. It looks great if you’re staring at your screen from afar, but close up these graphics are pixelated. Yeah it’s an old game, but after playing all the modern games you may or may not be able to adapt to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics. If you aren’t able to adapt you may be facing many hours of dizziness and nausea while playing this game. Overall this game was wonderful, the sound effects were very retro but still sounded clear and crisp. The controls were a little wonky and take a little getting used to because you can’t really move your mouse vertically in this game. Believe it or not this game actually has replayability, just mod out the doom mobs and turns them in to Barnies and/or Teletubbies!			"

This game has had custom levels and arenas made for it for over 15 years now, it has to have at least a million for it. not to mention the ever popular ""Brutal DooM"" mod for this game (although nothing beats the classic gameplay). This is my favorite game of all time! RIP AND TEAR!!!!!!			"

												This is just a perfect game and really holds up over the yearsOne of the best games ever i have been playing this since the 90's and its amazing i only had the demo for the longest time and then i got the full game and it is super amazing.Old school fps style shooter people still playing online using source ports and there are a tone of mods for everything.There are mods that make the game play next gen.

												Its freaking DOOM, the grand daddy that popularized the FPS genre.You can just replay this game over and over and still feels great to play, and plus the plethora amount of mods that will keep you playing for decades to come. The popular mod ""Brutal Doom"" which will enhances the doom experience and makes the doom guy x10 much more badass than he already is. The minor complaint that I have is you can't replay the levels I would love to replay, but I can't really bash them for that.It is worth every penny and still runs great on the current systems flawlessly-""RIP AND TREAT""			"

												DOOM isn't where the FPS genre started, but it is where SH!T GOT REAL.If you were alive in 1995 and you are still somehow immature enough to be playing PC games, follow these simple rules:1. Buy this.2. Google ""Brutal Doom."" 3. Download and install the aforementioned.(Brutal Doom updates the game for modern machines, but keeps the original look, while adding additional animations and a dumptruck full of blood and gore in every frame.  Do it. Do it now.)			"

												This game would immediately freeze on the title image whenever I tried to run it, regardless of which version I ran. I had one moment where I lucked out and was able to play for a few minutes, but the entire screen had a red filter over the gameplay. my advice: consider looking elsewhere for a better version of Doom.Edit: I knew it was The Ultimate DOOM and not the DOOM Remake, I'm no idiot. I used my own money to buy this game and tried to fix the errors myself. I looked in the discussions and nothing worked. I do care about this old game and personally enjoy playing it on the Shareware Version I found. This version of the game just didn't work for me.			"

Not really but I'll do one anyway.DooM is a FPS game that improved off fo wolfenstein3D to launch the FPS genre to center stage. A lot of the improvements are graphical such as floor and cealing textures. While some are dealing with rendering like you can now use slopes and stairs.It has fast paced action and a modding community that makes it even better.You should really pick up this game.			"

How to run ports\mods through Steam using ZDL 
A Guide for The Ultimate DOOM
By: Bunnings Wharehouse

			A guide to help people run modern Doom ports through Steam using ZDL, this enables Steam Overlay in the modern ports and keeps track of gaming hours.		


And THEN you have a highly enjoyable DOOM experience. Brutal DOOM works, I also tried some other mods like Pirate DOOM and the ZDL loader is a heaven-sent utility.I'm not going to waste space reviewing the game, it's a classic, it's the ♥♥♥♥, it's my favourite game of all time and blah blah blah nostalgia glasses: activate. The first three episodes are pinnacles of 90s FPS perfection, episode four is a bit bland by comparison, and that's all I'm saying.I just wanted to set the record straight that DOOM can be run like clockwork through Steam thanks to this loader.And for those saying ""but why should I have to do this if I paid money for it!"", I say ""Do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want, but if you want a good way of playing DOOM through Steam wiht next to no effort, well, here it is.""

												This is officially the first real FPS game. Ultimate Doom is still a fantastic shooter that is still mentioned when talking about non-regenerating health and fast paced running/gunning. Graphics wice Ultimate Doom is a bit of an eye sore (them pixels...) and controls are a bit silly in today's standards (mouse also moves you and you don't have to aim up and down) but the gameplay and atmosphere are still there. There's not much of a story besides marine in Mars, killing everything he sees. Levels get harder fast, demons bigger and the weapons more explosive. For young gamers I only recommend this if you're interested in old hard games or roots of FPS gaming.			"

												Putting myself into the shoes of a gamer in '93, Doom would have blown me away. Sure, the arcades were feeling Sega's games like Virtua Racing, but somehow managing to get a 3D shooter to run at 25-30 fps purely through DOS, that will run on a home PC in '93 just amazes me. Some very sneaky tricks must have been used to get that '3D' effect working in DOS. With good sound, good level design, and just a very classic feel to it, the overall experience feels like a primitive (but still very enjoyable) form of the games we have today. Back then, it would've really stood out. I say this without nostalgic bias, as I wasn't even alive at the time of release, but I can still see the serious jump Doom had over Wolfenstein 3D, or Pathways Into Darkness by Bungie for the Macintosh. ID Software really had the ball rolling here, with 4 player Deathmatch support, and being a key icon in popularising the fps genre, I'm going to have to hand it to them, it's hard to make a game that will still be enjoyable decades later.For its time, I'd give it a solid 9/10.

I will skip the part that talks about the story for this game because it really wasn't a focus. The gameplay is fast paced fun and while it may not have aged well vanilla, BRUTAL DOOM IS AWESOME.

												A classic in my mind, albeit one that hasn't aged well. If you must play this game, as I've said in my Doom II review, GET A SOURCE PORT. Not only will the game run a lot smoother, but it allows for custom controls and, of course, mod support. Using the regular DOSBox emulator, the classic Doom games run sluggishly and can even crash.And don't let my small play time fool you. I've actually been playing this and the other classic Doom games a LOT thanks to source ports like ZDoom and Skulltag. They don't track your playtime on Steam, though, unless you can figure out how to get the source port itself to run on Steam.			"

												Playing Doom today gives you an understanding how low nowadays shitdustry has fallen into the endless pit of brainless plebeian entertainment policies.Creating a Doom shooter today is simply impossible, because everything in this game contradicts the nowadays rules of conduct of creating mass appealing titles that play themselves to make pathetic ♥♥♥♥s feel good about themselves and forget how pathetic they are.It's not an accident that every single post-2006 drone can't pass the first level of the first Doom, even if its difficulty levels are lowered after re-release on digital platforms. Doom 2, Duke Nukem 3D and SW are better though. That's what people used to call a ""progress"" - making things better, not worse. It's a lot better (and faster) with gameplay tweaking mods. Metal soundtracks are recommended, too. But the original is still very playable, especially after slogging through crap like any recent Far Cry title.Also, ♥♥♥♥ Call of Duty.			"

If I move the mouse the music stops and skips (and the mouse doesn't move the character fwiw - which I do recall worked back in the day).Also - it doesn't appear to let you customize anything - I can't remember if that was a thing or not, but I wouldn't mind being able to customize the keys.So overall - it just seems lazy... Even for 5 dollars.On the plus side you have the game files - you can use something like Chocolate Doom or Doomsday to play the game a bit more reliably.			"

Shadow Warrior Redux was nice release with this one I'm not sure but if you haven't played Doom 1 ever I cannot recommend you to do so. It is an excellent game with some unique dark atmosphere.			"

												It's difficult to know where to begin when reviewing DOOM. For our generation, it's the equivalent of being handed the Bible and asked to give it a score out of ten..... The content isn't so much the important issue here, rather it's the legacy the game left behind.I don't think many people would argue that gaming (especially PC gaming) could be divided into ""Before DOOM"" and ""After DOOM"". No, it wasn't the first to do many of the tricks we now take for granted. No, it wasn't the best FPS around. But.... the iPod wasn't the first portable music player and certainly wasn't the best, but it changed the way we listen to music forever. DOOM did the same thing for the FPS, and that's not an exaggeration.You only have to look at the timeline of games development to see that it changed both the industry and people's attitudes. Suddenly, corporate networks were being clogged up with data from employees fragging each other when they should have been working. People at home were able to design their own levels and have others play them. The graphic violence drew criticism from various groups and DOOM was talked about in national media. Every games developer in the world was rushing their own FPS to market to try and cream off some of the publicity DOOM was generating. Some were successful (Duke Nukem 3D), some (Nitemare 3D?) less so.No, it wasn't the first to do any of these things. But at the time it was nothing short of a phenomenon. There was barely a console around which didn't receive some version of DOOM at some point (Even the VIC-20 got one eventually thanks to homebrew).Is it the best game ever? No. But it's very important if you're even slightly interested in games, and you owe it to yourself to at least play it. The industry was never the same again after DOOM. It kick-started the interest in LAN gaming, and made 3D gaming if not the standard, then at least a target to aspire to.iD of course managed to make lightning strike twice when Quake was released, but that's another story...

												One of the best first person shooters of all time, Doom has earned it's reputation for being the most innovative, (and contraversal) video games of all time. Released in 1993 for the PC by Id softwere. A range of weapons are available for killing various enemies through tons of complex, tricky maps with many secrets to find. Venture through mars, the planet Diemos, and hell it's self to kill the of the leaders of the evil that the worlds hold.This is an amazing game, and I recoment it to people who like older games and FPS games.

												I feel that I should warn everyone that this game along with Doom II, Final Doom and that Ultimate Levels for Doom II thing don't record any of your play time like other steam games do. DO NOT pay the 10 dollar price for these games. Twice a year the whole Doom pack (Including Doom 3 and its expansion) go on sale for less than 13 dollars. Once during august at Quake Con, and once during the holiday season. Buy it then.			"

												I bought this on Steam just so I could write a review of it, and maybe push id in the right direction with sales. I have actually played this game for hundreds of hours. I probably play it for at least 10-20 hours per year, for every year of my life.Let me make one thing perfectly clear: nostalgia does not factor into this game's enjoyment. Doom still has a very active community, and new mods come out all the time. Thanks to Carmack's programming, Doom made modding a staple of PC gaming, and it hasn't gone away. Getting older has made me see more of Doom's flaws, but I don't really like it any less.Doom is far from perfect. Unlike modern corridor shooters, which almost completely abandon the principles of level design, Doom is made or broken by its level design. There are a few different level designers that worked on Doom, and once you've played enough you can tell each of them just by playing their levels, even if you don't know their names. This means that level design is inconsistent, and therefore you're going to really like some levels and hate others. Most people who played Doom as a kid forgave the bad levels because, well, they were kids. If you're new to Doom, it's best to start at the beginning and play Episode 1 of Doom 1. This is widely regarded as one of the best, if not the best, set of levels for Doom, designed by John Romero. They're coherent, look nice (relatively speaking) and have well-placed secrets. Oddly enough, Doom 64 has one of the best sets of levels and plays like any of the other classic Doom games; google ""Doom 64 Absolution"" and you can easily find a total conversion mod that basically allows you to play Doom 64 on your computer once you have Doom. Thanks, Midway!Virtually every level can be summed up by ""find keys, throw switches, open doors."" This sounds bad, but again, it can either be tedious or enjoyable depending on the level's design. I must stress that the player should use their automap (tab key) here. Doom's levels are not afraid of having many twisting paths, and it's quite easy to get lost without it. Helpfully, switches are usually recessed into the wall slightly, which clearly marks them on the automap. If levels truly become tedious, don't be afraid to skip them by typing ""IDCLEVXX"", where ""XX"" is a two-digit number following the convention of episode number, then level number. i.e. IDCLEV14 changes to episode 1, level 4. Each episode has 9 levels. I won't lie to you, there are a few quite truly bad levels in Doom, but fortunately id left this cheat code in. Be careful, it starts the level as if you'd started a new game, which means you lose all your weapons except the pistol, and start with 100 health and 0 armor. However, all Doom levels are designed with pistol start in mind, so you should be able to manage with enough skill. Doom should be enjoyed on a level-by-level basis; remember, there is almost nothing in the narrative that ties these levels together. If you really hate a level, you should get used to the idea of just skipping it.The guns... well, everyone knows how the guns work, since they were the basis for almost every shooter arsenal until Unreal came out, notable exception being Rise of the Triad. They're quite well-balanced, actually, with the exception of the pistol, which becomes useless once you get the chaingun. The shotgun and chaingun are good at long range. The super shotgun is probably the best all-around weapon in the game, although it doesn't appear until Doom 2. The rocket launcher and plasma rifle are high-power weapons meant to break out against threatening hordes of monsters, and the BFG is there when nothing else substitutes.  Every one of them has a place in your arsenal, although depending on the levels you're playing, you may be using one a lot more than the other due to ammo distribution. Doom is famously narrative-light. Romero makes a good effort to portray ""realistic"" military base locations, but the game's somewhat ridiculously deep story penned by Tom Hall was thrown out in short order - trust me, if you'd have read it, you would agree that it is quite over-the-top for a fledgling shooter made in 1993. The inconsistency between levels means that the ultimate choice to abandon any hope of telling a story beyond the intermission text screens was probably for the best. There are a few key events that happen in the plot, but they mostly happen at the end of or between episodes.Overall, I highly recommend Doom for anyone who enjoys shooters but hasn't played Doom before. I also recommend Doom for anyone who is new to shooters, since it was also designed for that audience. If nothing else, it will give them an appreciation for where the genre has come from. This game still holds up very well today, especially with the active modding community. HOWEVER: If you do buy this game, do NOT run it as-is from Steam's library. To run the game on modern systems, it comes packaged with DOSBox, which simulates the MS-DOS environment. The emulation can slow down your computer considerably and ironically make running the game more difficult. You should instead download and install one of the many ""source ports,"" which are redesigns of the actual game engine to make it compatible with modern computers. ZDoom is a good and popular choice. Some ""purists"" swear by Chocolate Doom, which faithfully recreates the game, merely updating it to allow it to run on modern hardware without such niceties as OpenGL or mouselook.			"

												How can I describe my thoughts on this game from what I have played in the last 10 mins?The answer would be by telling you how within the first level of the game I was on the edge of my seat. I relished every shotgun shell I found, loving and caring for it until I found a home for it in someones skull. I feared the moment I had when I first saw that bull demon thing, with only a pistol and my wits. I smiled as I found the chaingun for the first time and cleared an entire room in a single blast. If you are considering buying this game and you are a fan of true run and gun gameplay, this is the big daddy of them all, and I'm saying this having only played 10 mins. It is every bit worth every cent it cost to buy. Good luck and welcome to your Doom.			"

												I may not have been born when this game was at its peak, however, I can without a doubt say that Doom is one of my favorite games of all time. While the objectives in the game hardly change each individual level feels radically different than the last. The awesome soundtrack/monsters/weapons further aid in this since almost all of those are constantly different between each level.			"

												How can I describe my thoughts on this game from what I have played in the last 10 mins?The answer would be by telling you how within the first level of the game I was on the edge of my seat. I relished every shotgun shell I found, loving and caring for it until I found a home for it in someones skull. I feared the moment I had when I first saw that bull demon thing, with only a pistol and my wits. I smiled as I found the chaingun for the first time and cleared an entire room in a single blast. If you are considering buying this game and you are a fan of true run and gun gameplay, this is the big daddy of them all, and I'm saying this having only played 10 mins. It is every bit worth every cent it cost to buy. Good luck and welcome to your Doom.			"

												I bought this on Steam just so I could write a review of it, and maybe push id in the right direction with sales. I have actually played this game for hundreds of hours. I probably play it for at least 10-20 hours per year, for every year of my life.Let me make one thing perfectly clear: nostalgia does not factor into this game's enjoyment. Doom still has a very active community, and new mods come out all the time. Thanks to Carmack's programming, Doom made modding a staple of PC gaming, and it hasn't gone away. Getting older has made me see more of Doom's flaws, but I don't really like it any less.Doom is far from perfect. Unlike modern corridor shooters, which almost completely abandon the principles of level design, Doom is made or broken by its level design. There are a few different level designers that worked on Doom, and once you've played enough you can tell each of them just by playing their levels, even if you don't know their names. This means that level design is inconsistent, and therefore you're going to really like some levels and hate others. Most people who played Doom as a kid forgave the bad levels because, well, they were kids. If you're new to Doom, it's best to start at the beginning and play Episode 1 of Doom 1. This is widely regarded as one of the best, if not the best, set of levels for Doom, designed by John Romero. They're coherent, look nice (relatively speaking) and have well-placed secrets. Oddly enough, Doom 64 has one of the best sets of levels and plays like any of the other classic Doom games; google ""Doom 64 Absolution"" and you can easily find a total conversion mod that basically allows you to play Doom 64 on your computer once you have Doom. Thanks, Midway!Virtually every level can be summed up by ""find keys, throw switches, open doors."" This sounds bad, but again, it can either be tedious or enjoyable depending on the level's design. I must stress that the player should use their automap (tab key) here. Doom's levels are not afraid of having many twisting paths, and it's quite easy to get lost without it. Helpfully, switches are usually recessed into the wall slightly, which clearly marks them on the automap. If levels truly become tedious, don't be afraid to skip them by typing ""IDCLEVXX"", where ""XX"" is a two-digit number following the convention of episode number, then level number. i.e. IDCLEV14 changes to episode 1, level 4. Each episode has 9 levels. I won't lie to you, there are a few quite truly bad levels in Doom, but fortunately id left this cheat code in. Be careful, it starts the level as if you'd started a new game, which means you lose all your weapons except the pistol, and start with 100 health and 0 armor. However, all Doom levels are designed with pistol start in mind, so you should be able to manage with enough skill. Doom should be enjoyed on a level-by-level basis; remember, there is almost nothing in the narrative that ties these levels together. If you really hate a level, you should get used to the idea of just skipping it.The guns... well, everyone knows how the guns work, since they were the basis for almost every shooter arsenal until Unreal came out, notable exception being Rise of the Triad. They're quite well-balanced, actually, with the exception of the pistol, which becomes useless once you get the chaingun. The shotgun and chaingun are good at long range. The super shotgun is probably the best all-around weapon in the game, although it doesn't appear until Doom 2. The rocket launcher and plasma rifle are high-power weapons meant to break out against threatening hordes of monsters, and the BFG is there when nothing else substitutes.  Every one of them has a place in your arsenal, although depending on the levels you're playing, you may be using one a lot more than the other due to ammo distribution. Doom is famously narrative-light. Romero makes a good effort to portray ""realistic"" military base locations, but the game's somewhat ridiculously deep story penned by Tom Hall was thrown out in short order - trust me, if you'd have read it, you would agree that it is quite over-the-top for a fledgling shooter made in 1993. The inconsistency between levels means that the ultimate choice to abandon any hope of telling a story beyond the intermission text screens was probably for the best. There are a few key events that happen in the plot, but they mostly happen at the end of or between episodes.Overall, I highly recommend Doom for anyone who enjoys shooters but hasn't played Doom before. I also recommend Doom for anyone who is new to shooters, since it was also designed for that audience. If nothing else, it will give them an appreciation for where the genre has come from. This game still holds up very well today, especially with the active modding community. HOWEVER: If you do buy this game, do NOT run it as-is from Steam's library. To run the game on modern systems, it comes packaged with DOSBox, which simulates the MS-DOS environment. The emulation can slow down your computer considerably and ironically make running the game more difficult. You should instead download and install one of the many ""source ports,"" which are redesigns of the actual game engine to make it compatible with modern computers. ZDoom is a good and popular choice. Some ""purists"" swear by Chocolate Doom, which faithfully recreates the game, merely updating it to allow it to run on modern hardware without such niceties as OpenGL or mouselook.			"

												Oddly enough, I played DOOM II before DOOM in 95, so this was really my second installment in the series, about two years later. Back in 1995 things were simpler — I only had DOOM II, and Hover! so I could just play the obvious choice; come 1996 and (Final) DOOM, and choices were not that easy anymore: there also were Grand Prix 2 and FIFA 97 to be taken care of. Well, even though the choice wasn't easy, it always boiled down to my favourite meat-grinding, first-person gore party. I believe — and this is probably just my heart talking — DOOM II was far better than the original, but even then I knew perfectly that this would be a milestone, this would matter, this would've made history.It's not too late to claim your part in it.

(DON'T WORRY ZDOOM AND CHOCOLATE DOOM ARE FREE)Graphics 4/5Level design 4/5 Music 5/5Demons 666/5A timeless classic that has something for everyone. Simple gameplay for people new to games, Fast paced action shooting for FPS fans and keycard collecting for weirdo's  who like to collect keycards. Now where's the red keycard?The game is about shooting demons and going to hell, thats all. Every in the weapon is useful (exept the pistol and fist if you don't have the beserker powerup). The weapons you will be using the most are the shotgun, minigun and rocket launcher. Later on in the game you will be using the plasma gun and BFG. The enemys in doom are fun to fight against and you need to find to perfect weapon to use against them. First you got zombies/possessed soldiers with guns, Imps that throw fireballs, flying demon strawberries and a GIANT goat person with a missile launcher for an arm. The music is the best part. Though it is stolen from other artists like metallica, Pantera, Slayer and Alice in chains. But it does not stop it from being good, Infact it makes it sound cooler. If your playing doom in a sourceport like ZDOOM it uses the soundfont on your computer which makes it 10 times better.just get it or I WILL RIP AND TEAR HUGE GUTS!!!

My Review on DOOM needs no Introduction.The Storyline is simple, you're a Space Marine that's transfered to Mars as Security for the Union Aerospace Corporation or UAC While they conduct Teleportation Experments on Mars' 2 Moons; Phobos and Deimos. But when a Teleportation Experment goes astary due to a terrible accident, Phobos Base sends out a distress signal while Deimos Base drops dead & disappears completely.

												So, I have to say firstly that I love Doom games. However, a forewarning to those of you running anything newer than Windows 7. This game will NOT run if you have a new operating system. Apparently, it only works up to Win 7 and past that it just gets stuck on the splash screen of the game with no sound, and no keyboard or mouse input being accepted. This obviously makes the game unfortunately unplayable. However there are solutions such as zDoom, which is what I am using right now to relive one of the first shooter games I ever played.			"

												Classic FPS, very accessible and easy to pick up and play for newcommers to the fps genre yet challenging for veterans. There are 5 difficulty levels which dramatically effect the way the game plays. Whether you're looking for some hardcore action with unforgivable enemies or you want to breeze through with a chaingun tearing the demons to pieces, you should play doom.The levels are huge and very easy to get lost in, there are tonnes of secrets to look out for too and loads of ammo/health kits to keep you energized, you can either explore these huge demon filled labyrinths looking for secrets or breeze through the level trying to beat your best time. The art design is great, the computer/monitor sprites are rather detailed for it's time and the enemy designs are very detailed too, particularly the hulking demon enemies you will fight later on in the game. There are also several obtainable weapons and you can carry 1 of each weapon, no stupid 2 weapon limit, once you find a weapon, it's yours... until you die but you can jsut reload a save if you want to keep them, there are some really cool weapons like the minigun and the BFG which differ from your conventional FPS weapon arsenal.The only issue is that you may occasionally find yourself in a dark room, now this is expected in a game like doom, however the flashing lights can be a bit uneasy on the eyes, it would have been better if the flashing was slowed down a touch, i don't reccommend this game to anybody with epilepsy but to everybody else, if you're remotely interested in the roots of the FPS genre or you want to have some kick ♥♥♥ old school FPS action, you need to get this game now!Do note that considering it's age, Doom is missing vital features of more modern FPS such as the ability to aim up and down so it may confuse players who are used to more modern shooters but don't worry as the game will auto aim at enemies in line with your gun no matter what height they are.

												it's only natural to imitate success. doom definalty had an impact on gaming in genral, it basicly made the first person shooter genre a thing and people now-a-days do not respect that.another thing: you are not a true gamer unless you launched this game on DOS on a windows 95 computer.i remember when i was five years old playing this in my dads basement and having a hell of a good time.this game is not story driven but there IS a story: sientists of the UAC (Union Aerospace Corperation) were experementing with teleportation and ends up opening the gates to hell,hell-spawn starts pouring through the gate open because of the tleportation experements.above all else I and many, MANY other people highly recommend this game 12/10here's a shotgun! no more questions! go shoot some demons on mars!

												Wont work on my Alienware with windows 8 so I need to use my terrible computer in the back that has vista. But the game plays fine. Ther are many ways to fix this issue, just search it. I also never played Doom before. I knew what it was since I was like 7 but never got around to playing it. This was definitely a breath of fresh air from cod or the usual Battlefield. I think the game is great and if you want it, get it.			"

The Ultimate DooM		* 10/10The Ultimate DooM on Steam		* 0/10I believe there's not much to say about DooM. Not the first FPS, but I could say it's ""The First Bad@$$ FPS Ever. PERIOD"". Why the 2 rates? Let's say the 10/10 rate is related to the Game itself (or every Pros I've though of and listed) while the 0/10 is related to the Game As a Steam Release (Everything is listed in the Cons Section). Consider that I grew up with doom, I was 6 years old when the shareware was being widespread all over the world, and still nowadays I own The original DooM, DooM II and The Ultimate Collection DooM 95 (With Ultimate DooM, DooM II And Final DooM). Despite all this I regret to NOT Recommend this RELEASE (Not THE GAME, mind you). On a Side note: all the DooM chapters have been released on Steam like this, so I'm not recommending Any other chapter, specifically DooM II, Final DooM nor even the Master levels for DooM II. My same Review will be posted in all those releases because of the same flaws.+++PROs+++The Following Points are the reason I MUST recommend this Game
 FPS. The genre was defined by THIS game (Yes, yes, there was Wolfenstein before, but the mainstream came with DooM overwhelming popularity). I still feel Adrenaline while sporting around an arsenal of weapons through Maps totally full of monsters and a gameplay that can be summarized as ""shoot (or run through) everything that moves and get to the exit"". Sounds lame but everything started from here, and simpler things are not boring here. They're Fun. MUSIC. It's a widely known story and it's true. Most of the bad@$$ music you hear in game are nothing but ripoffs from famous Metal or Hard Rock famous songs. How could a game be more Bad@$$ than this? MODS. One of the most Modded game ever. There are even lots of Ports, because DooM originally is a DOS game so it always had few issues with windows' environment (mainly audio related, who remembers autoexec.bat, dos=high umb and other damn DOS lines like them? XD). Lots of famous mods, that can revolutionize the gameplay (like Brutal Doom), or even new maps (See Alien DooM), or totally messed up demented projects (like the Italian And somehow Satyrical/blatantly blasphemous Grezzo 2... I am told it's greatly appreciated around the world... even though most characters are italian or from italian Television, and everything is written/spoken in italian... so... O.o). There are even lots of guides, both in steam and in other sites, with solutions to all of the CONs I've listed.---CONs---The following points are the reason I will NEVER recommend this release on Steam.
 STEAM OVERLAY. This release runs directly with dosbox, so obviously the overlay won't work. THE PORT. Actually this release has no ports... It's the usual game that runs on DosBox... Which is not the best solution because it's just an emulation of a DOS Environment which means that you can easily experience some minor LAGs, both on video and audio. Not to mention the inferior Midi quality. On top of that it has 2 options, the classic input and the DEFAULT ""Modern input"" with WASD Movement AND Mouse MOVEMENT...Not Mouselook, MOVEMENT. So obviously you can't use the mouse because it goes in conflict with the WASD keys... And you can't use the arrows because ONLY Left and Right are Binded... WHAT THE F**K?!?!?!?!? WHO THE HELL IS THE INCOMPETENT THAT WORKED ON THIS $H17 AND APPROVED IT?!?!?!?!? AND THIS C**P IS THE DEFAULT SETTING!!!! I know there are solutions inside steam's community discussions and guides, but I don't care, releasing a product of the importance as DooM in this state is SIMPLY RIDICULOUS. And you want to know something? Do you remember the Excellent DooM 95 Port where you have a simple window with tidy options and settings? You even have settings to add Mods. Do you know who worked on that project in his Microsoft's days? GABE NEWELL. And here on Steam I have to find this Garbage on DosBox... I could have Downloaded from google in 2 minutes both the WADs AND a DECENT Port IF (i repeat) IF MY ORIGINAL COPIES  Of DooM, DooM II And ""Ultimate Doom, DooM II And Final With DooM 95"" (Yes I DO OWN ALL OF THEM) were somehow misteriously Burnt out... Steam doesn't consider profitable to ask microsoft a deal to use the best BASIC port for DooM? Fine, Use another one, or make something decent yourself, it's really ridiculous to get such a great game released in such a bad and approximate way... And maybe I'm mistaken, Steam is just a digital distribution platform and the quality of the product released relies on the Developer. It doesn't change anything. The fact that Whoever worked on this release setted the game to play by default with a SELF-CONTRADICTORY INPUT SYSTEM is still RIDICUOUS ... And a reason BIG ENOUGH to AVOID this release LIKE A DISEASE... (Ho-ho-ho, I'm a poet... XD... But seriously, don't waste here your money...) "

												Honestly, it's a bit clunky. Not being able to look up or down is always annoying. Even worse, moving the mouse forward or back instead moves me forwards or backwards, which is really annoying when I'm trying not to fall. I mean, seriously, what FPS does that, having the mouse move the player? It goes against every gaming instinct I've developed from FPSs.As far as I know, there's no way to change the controls, so I'm stuck with this bass ackwards mouse control.Other than that, there's not much to say. I mean, it's the original DOOM, pretty much. An all-time classic. I would say it's aged relatively well. Graphics can get repetitive, what you have to do isn't always straightforward, and some times the game makes you jump through extra hoops just for some cheap hits (if I remember correctly, in E1M4, you have to get the red keycard, which sets off a flag for more enemies to be released, and you have to get through them to get the blue keycard). But overall, it's fun, it's challenging, and it's DOOM.Hell awaits you... Are you ready for it?			"

												I love Doom, so don't get me wrong. This version of Doom, is not converted. It uses DOS Box, not every computer is compatable with it. So there is a strong chance you will be wasting your money here.			"

												Do you really need a review? Seriously. This is Doom, the grand daddy of the entire FPS genre. I will say this game has aged remarkably well (especially with mods like Doom Engine, GZdoom and Brutal Doom. The resolution change brings the sprites up quite a bit and there are even mods that replce the sprites with 3D models. In short. This game is a classic and it still kicks ♥♥♥.It will also likely kick your ♥♥♥ mercilessly.			"

												if you're buying this keep in mind that you will have have to mess with so many files just to get it to work(and even then it'll still probably freeze on the title screen) you'd be better off buying an old pc with the original copy of doom			"

												This game is a legendary game, with many knowing of it and it's legacy. However, this port is pure ♥♥♥♥. Of the four times I ran it, all four times it crashed. The first time it crashed at boot up, the second at the beginning of Map 1 in the firs campaign, the third at the end of the first chapter, and the fourth at the title screen. This is a great game, but this port is a slander to it's greatness, and it's reputation.			"

												The game itself being ""DOOM"" is an excellent fps that defined the genre, but this version is not very good. This DOOM port is  a DOS emulator with the DOOMrom attatched. This means that it is poorly optimized for a modern computer. There is a lack of any controller options, meaning you have to use the origional control scheme which is very tank-like, using the arrow keys to go forward, back, and turining while using the ""ctrl"" key to fire and holding ""alt"" to strafe. The mouse support is awful simply acting as the arrow keys. A better DOOM for a modern machine is DOOM 3 bfg edition. This includes all of the DOOM games and all have been updated for a new computer with modern fps controls.			"
