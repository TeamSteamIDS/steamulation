												As of the recent patch, Rockstar ruined the game for everyone for literally no reason. The patch, which is MANDATORY to play the game through Steam now, replaced the original game with the garbage ""HD"" mobile port that was released on the Xbox 360, which;-removes 18 songs (""Critical Beatdown"", ""Running Down A Dream"", ""Woman To Woman"", ""You Dropped A Bomb On Me"", ""Yum Yum"", ""Running Away"", ""I Don't Give A f*ck"", ""Express Yourself"", ""Killing in the Name of"", ""Hellraiser"", ""Ring My Bell"", ""Personal Jesus"", ""Don't Let It Go To Your Head"", ""Rock Creek Park"", ""Grunt"", ""Soul Power '74"" and ""The Payback"")-revokes all mods created for San Andreas on PC-deletes all of your previous save files-removes 1280x700 resolution-has various textures missing and things like foilage completely removedThis update does nothing but suggest that no GTA game on Steam is safe from future backstabbing, downgrading, game breaking updates and I am truly ashamed that I gave my money to Rockstar for this game which not only I, but a plethora of fans love to death.This is a cancerous update and I highly recommend you get a physical copy of the game or get a download somewhere else of v1 or v1.1, because this is disgusting coming from Rockstar. If you already own the game on Steam, then immedietely write a bad review for this game and complain to Rockstar Games about this.EDIT: As of 26th February, Rockstar still haven't said a word about this and have delayed GTA V on PC for the third time to improve their quarterly sales report. They sure seem to care about the consumer.			"

												San Andreas is one of my all-time favorite games, and for very good reason. It's a fantastic entry to the series, with enough content to keep you occupied for weeks. That's not even including the highly populated and still, very much alive multiplayer mod (SA-MP) and the plethora of other mods you can obtain for this amazing game. However, since Rockstar is so hell-bent on ruining the PC user's experience, I can't recommend the Steam release of this game. The latest patch has removed a number (18, to be specific) of key songs from the once fantastic soundtrack. There is still no 1080p support. Previous save files will no longer work and you -will- more than likely crash if you are playing this game with a dual-monitor set up. Although despite these downgrades, at least they were 'kind enough' to implement very basic Xinput support, so you can play it with a controller. Woo.Rockstar has all the right to do this. The removal of once available songs makes sense due to copyright reasons. You can't exactly sell your product when it contains content you no longer have the license to use, let alone monetize. But when the game is deliberately patched to take away content that users have already paid for, and to hinder the experience once again, you're just hurting your PC fanbase. Which, I suppose is nothing new if you've played any PC release of Grand Theft Auto post-GTA3.The best way to enjoy this game is to purchase a retail copy. It'll probably be cheaper, it'll look good on your shelf, you can mod it by default all you want, and you won't have any of your content patched out without warning. With that said. Don't bother buying any other GTA games on Steam either. If they've already removed content in one title, then expect it again in the future from other installments of the franchise when licenses inevitably expire, or can no longer be obtained. TL;DR: Great game but ruined by Rockstar's anti-consumer attitude. Go buy it elsewhere for the full experience.			"

												This is a ground breaking release that I own on PS2 and PC. It increased the scale of the previous GTA games and introduced addictive RPG game mechanics into the series. Samuel L Jackson as officer Tenpenny is some of the best celeb casting in a video game ever. This is a game that precedes the dumbing down of AAA gaming, where the mass market was encouraged to enjoy a complex and sometimes difficult title.Sadly, I can't recommend the game in its current state. Rockstar has decided to gimp the soundtrack by removing several important songs that contributed to the atmosphere while roaming open world. This would be a hard sell even if they only did this to new customers, but in my case they have removed songs that were once in the game that I paid for. The situation is unacceptable. It underpins the ridiculousness of license agreements, when they make a title worse for all the paying customers, while leaving those who download the title illegaly with the experience as it was originally intended.

Them nearby gangsters are probably like: Whats he doing in the middle of the road? Is he mad dogging us? Is he comtemplating life? Did he just get an epiphany of his OG lifestyle and is thinking about going to art school? Why is he wearing socks with sandals? How can we see that he's wearing socks with sandals if hes in his car? Why are we, a gang in the corner of a burger joint, questioning this man enjoying some tunes in his ride? Then the gangsters walked away in silence and became philosophers. But dat music tho.			"

												Ok first off, this is one the best GTA games because it is the longest GTA with over 30 hours of storyline and you have 3 cities to explore unlike other GTA games where you're just stuck in one city and best of all there are RPG elements to it that give this game a big + from all the other GTA games. The cities you get to explore are Los Santos which is based on Los Angeles and does a really good job with detailing the area and putting the ghetto into it and makes you feel like you actually live in the hood. You have the countryside between Los Santos and San Fierro and feels like you live in California with its lush forests. San Fierro which is based on San Francisco also does a good job and feels like a believable Bay Area city, The dessert between San Fierro and Las Venturas feels like a realistic mojave desert and is perfect(especially if you're a fallout fan) to explore. Las Venturas is based on Las Vegas and does an amazing job with its neon lights and casinos to make it a realstic metropolis. The game mechanics in this game are very heavliy improved from Vice City because you can now see your target's health and driving feels more loose in SA. You have gang wars which are pretty fun and lets you recruit your own gang members and take over other hoods by playing a little survival mini game. The soundtrack is amazing in this game and is very believable and feels you are actually living in the 90's and is my second favorite soundtrack after Vice City. Oh and using the jetpack is so much fun. Now the flaws on this game is that even though GTA SA is challenging it is also has very tedious missions, especially missions that involve using an airplane. Those missions are terrible, not fun at all and have the worst controls that I have ever seen in a video game. The story is flawed in many ways too and there is some character flaws here and there but the story isn't bad at all and it's very deep. The characters are also memorable too and good voice acting from Samuel L. mutha♥♥♥♥in Jackson. Yes he plays the main antagonist which also gives this game another +. Like I said earlier, this game is challenging and tedious at times but it's very rewarding and that's what makes a good video game. This I would say would be my favorite GTA game after Vice City and this game was worth playing through till the end and is a masterpiece.			"

												I want to recommend this game but i can't. This game is amazing for many reasons. It feels nostalgic... familiar. Or at least DID.... but here is the thing;BOOM, 10 years later, Rockstar decides to update the game. I was pretty surprised myself.Worst update ever.Save files are broken, they removed multiple songs and resolutions.And that sh""tty mobile port.Now i know most of the negative reviews consist of the new update and so on. But my complaint is modding. THEY COMPLETELY REMOVED MODDING. Now i know GTA SA on steam was never mod friendly, but there was a way to mod it anyways, and i was happy. Why Rockstar? Why would you remove modding capabilites? You removed the ability to play SAMP! Why? The best thing ever!I read a review a couple months back suggesting adding Steam Workshop to this game. GREAT IDEA.Now Rockstar, would you please tell us why you came back 10 years later to break the game, but can't add Steam Workshop after MULTIPLE REQUESTS?As i said, i woud've highly recommended this game a while back, but for now, i feel like i just got robbed.Get your sh""t together Rockstar.Sorry for english mistakes, it is not my primary language.-SpTmBrThanks :) "

												Once upon a time, this was fun PC port of a landmark console title.Then November 7, 2014 (Black Friday) came.Rockstar ""patched"" all the life out of the title, effectively replacing the PC version with a port of the mobile version.  With that, even users who had purchased the game long ago are now stuck with an even poorer port of the game, fewer songs in the game's soundtrack, and paltry graphics/resolution options.Rockstar has perfectly exploited and demonstrated all of the real and perceived flaws of a digital distribution platform.

Grand Auto IV was best game for me but this is legendary too, it's hard to believe how Rockstar Games made huge and awesome game like this back in 2004. This game rocks for long time and i will never forget this classic when im older. Everything in this game is perfectly made and finished, if you got bored you can always do some cheats to have fun and tons of mods just adds playing. MTA (Multi Theft Auto) and SAMP (San Andreas Multiplayer) mods adds multiplayer to this game and... oh boy, GTA experience just gets bigger whole time!Summary: Childhood classic, an example of how to make the perfect game.10/10!

Great story and a very large world (in 2005 it was cool) and a lot of opportunities and freedom of action. Lots of interesting (and not) missions, as well as many other interesting places. I could continue to describe this game... but better to play it and rate it. Thank you RockStar for this wonderful game.			"

												GTA San Andreas in general is a classic game no doubt, but this release is truly a horrible port. It took nearly 10 years for Rockstar to add true controller support (November 2014) and even that is mediocre at best. It's worthy to note that in the November 2014 patch, Rockstar disenfranchised its current customers by unnecessarily removing content and apparently stripping out higher resolutions options. The patch also caused the in-game graphics to appear worse (though this could just be isolated to my experience). Overall, the steam version of GTA San Andreas is more like the ""Frankenstein version” and I wouldn't recommend it to those seeking the authentic GTA San Andreas experience. If you don't mind your game constantly transforming on you, then I suppose this version may be for you. Rockstar's track record of poor GTA PC releases undoubtedly continues with their latest revision of this great game.Recommended Fixes/ModsFor those who already own GTA: San Andreas on Steam, you should consider installing ""Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - Enhanced Edition"" mod per the Steam User Guide:

												Well not much to say about this game anymore after the update. Read below why you should not buy it anymore.BEFORE THE UPDATE:- Vanilla GTA- Mod support where no problem. ( i could actaully add my things to the game without it crashed at loading)- Well all the best songs where there.- I enjoyed this game so freaking much.AFTER THE UPDATE:- The game can't even load when you run it the first time and has sat everything on fullest( i need to play this game in the lowest res now, untill the first mission is done and has been saved, then i can change graphics)- Songs need- the game can't load half my mods anymore.    - If you are like me that needs to run Oblivion and SRT 3 this game is not for you on steam the Exe file doesn't allow major changes or multiple exes for each mod, this makes it impossible for me to test the new U-boats i made and several planes as they somehow now uses more memory than the steam version allows - i've given up trying to find some fixes for this game- oh yeah and the mouse keeps disabeling itself now, so you got to go to the main menu use the mouse a bit and then get back into the game.I love GTA SA and have more than about 500 hours of gameplay and even more testing mods i make. but the steam version dont work correctly. ( in the off steam version, dont include my steam game time, that is only the hours the game spent crashing and causing problems)			"

												Growing up as a white kid in a non-white neighborhood, I got a lot of bikes stolen from me. I would say over the course of my life I've had about 10-12 bikes stolen. This used to make me really sad, but in GTA San Andreas I got to role play stealing a bike from a white kid and riding off into the sunset with it. I had no idea it was so much fun to steal bikes from white kids. Now that GTA taught this to me I'm not sad about all my lost bikes, because I know how much joy stealing them from me brought to other people.			"

But the last new update completely ruined the game...Edit: The update makes V1.0 crash more (Let's face it. 80% of the people play SA-MP/MTA if not more). This is a great example why there should be a downgrade/no updates option on steam. The pirated version/Retail is better (I don't encourage Pirating but if you bought the game, there shouldn't be any guilt)			"

												Now before I start here: Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a really good game. I love it to the point where I own both the physical copy and the Steam version.But recently, Rockstar made a patch that is just absolutely unacceptable.Here's what they did:Adds Xinput controller support (Xbox 360 controllers)Now this is good. But it's the only good thing about the patch.Makes “Steering with Mouse” enabled by defaultThis is an odd choice but usually I'd let a quirky design choice like this slide as long as it's toggleable.Removes several songs from *all owners* and from future purchases (the same ones that were removed in the mobile version)Even if certain licenses expired, it doesn't excuse outright removing certain songs from the game. The physical and retail versions still have them, are they gonna get banned globally now? Of course not.Removes several resolution options, including 1920×1080This is the worst part of all. How the ♥♥♥♥ can anyone defend this? At least with the last part I could kinda see where they were coming from copyright-wise, but they're straight-up removing features from the game for absolutely no reason.Loading a saved game starts a new oneAgain, absolutely unacceptable. What good does it do to literally break the save feature of a game?Final verdict: Please, if you haven't played it already, either buy it physically or pirate an older version of it. This version is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that no consumer should ever deal with. Rockstar is never getting another penny from me, and it's such a shame that I need to do this with GTA V coming out on PC soon, but I cannot support any companies who think it's a good idea to literally REMOVE CONTENT FROM YOUR GAME FOR ABSOLUTELY NO ♥♥♥♥ING REASON. ♥♥♥♥ YOU ROCKSTAR.

												Somewhere, someone in Rockstar Studios decided to ""update"" their game, nearly ten years after release, to make it ultimately inferior - a worse product. They removed songs, replaced textures, removed details, and generally downgraded it. They decided to take away developers from certain development teams (such as the Grand Theft Auto V development team) to make this version worse.This is absolutely and completely stupid. I beg of you to not purchase this product, and, if you already own it, to write a poor review for it to inform Rockstar Studios of their mistake so that this version may, possibly, be fixed. I want only the best version of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas to be on Steam. This is truly a fantastic game, though this is a poor version.			"

												This is, perhaps, the best GTA game in the history of the franchise. I think that pretty much anybody who's ever played GTA knows about this game, and I'd dare to say that, in most cases, this is the one people remember the most. While the other games from the 3D era were pretty good as well (I'll always have a soft spot for Vice City, which was my first GTA ever), this one takes the cake. Rather than being limited to a single city, like previous games (or a bunch of cities divided in levels, like the original GTA), this one's set in an entire state, with three large cities (Los Santos, San Fierro and Las Venturas), a bunch of small towns, and lots of countryside to explore.The game feels HUGE. And it's not just a big map that's pretty much empty unless it's a plot-essential area. You can easily go around exploring and find places with great detail (for the time) that are completely irrelevant to the plot; in fact, there's large areas of the map that you'll never go to if you only focus on the story, and this includes some small towns. Still, they're there, to make the world feel alive. When it comes to the main cities, they're pretty good, and, again, there's lots of details here and there to make them feel like scaled-down versions of the real cities they're based in.The gameplay is what you'd expect from GTA. There's shooting, there's carjacking, all the good ol' GTA stuff. However, this game was the first in the series to introduce some light-RPG elements. Not only could you customize the way CJ looked by changing his clothes and haircut, but you could also make him fat, or have him train at the gym making him stronger and learning new combat moves. And his skill with vehicles and weapons could improve as well the more you used them. There's also tons of side missions and activities besides the main plot, including the classic odd jobs like Vigilante on Paramedic, and a few new ones as well.The storyline of the game is great. It begins with CJ returning to the hood after 5 years, and, like many GTA games, it's a story of working your way up from the bottom. However, what makes this one stand out in my opinion is that it isn't only about the rise of a powerful criminal, but it's also about family and friendship. Pretty well written, with some serious moments, along with some great humour. Not to mention a lot of references and callbacks to previous games from the 3D era.The ""soundtrack"", or rather the in-game radio stations are pretty good; there's a wide variety of genres, and the actual soundtrack played during cutscenes and such is good as well. Not to mention that you can add your own music for the radio stations, so you can always listen to something you like while playing.Well, I think that's pretty much everything I've got to say about GTA:SA. I really recommend it, as it is one of my favourite GTA games, and the one I played the most (both on the PS2 and on PC).			"

												Heya. This game will  guarantee an authentic groove life experience. The way you make contact with this life, it's one of a kind. It's not all about thugs, drugs, thefting and many others like these. It becomes really funny when you discover such a large world, a replica of early '90 years, in which you can transform this game into a role-play one. You will feel me after you will play it. They brushed every single object, excluding the sky-scrapers. You can even enter in some gigantic boats of army.I bought this game for almost 3 euros. I did because it was the game I was obsessed to play when I was younger, like 4 years ago. I even gifted few to my friends. This game has been a massive impact upon Action Games; a tremendous jump from GTA Vice City; no one would have expected such a real game.Now some particular issues:Pro:- huge map; so well detalied;- plenty of characters you will make contact with;- variety of vehicles(tanks, choppers, boats, cars, bicycles)- many missions, all achievable;- sound track, voice lines between characters;- weather types, all again neat;- good radio stations, well suited to that period;- you can find more by playing it.:Cons:- nothin' ;- just to fill this space- this game has lost its delight because many gamers now play only by their attention given to graphics details. I know it's an old game. Still, you don't know it untill you don't play it.All in all, shall you ask yourself if you should buy this game? No, just do it right away. It's not expensive, not by a strecth. It's a neat game, it calls you! Buy it and play some SA-MP with your colleagues, this is the most epic childhood for an early-gamer.Cheers!			"

Just by the songs they were removed I think it's enough to not have the same experience. 1080p deleted, glitches, mod support broken, save files pre-patch don't work anymore.Consider looking into the PS2, Original Xbox or retail physical version of the game.

												My god! It's been almost 10 years since this game was released! That was quite a long time ago. And to see it released after Vice City it was a big deal. Seriously, the game employed at least 10 times the area Vice City had. And here there are 3 different cities available not to mention the countryside in between these. This game is huge and just by completing all side missions you can easily go over a 100 hours of gameplay time!This game still did not have any physics as in order to get the next gen feeling we needed to wait for the 4th instalment of the franchise. But this is not a problem as in case you look at it as Vice City's successor you can appreciate what San Andreas offers: greater playable area, hundreds of vehicles, minigames, car modifications, gang wars and the ability to purchase clothing, tattoos and even to have your own haircut.I had only an issue with the game's RPG elements: for some reason some stunts are not available at first and you need to keep driving a car until you unlock the next level. To be able to sprint further or have stronger punches in melee you need to visit the gym often. From time to time you need to eat but junk food will soon make you obese. So you need to visit the gym again. These side activities stole some of my time and I never liked paying any attention to them but I had to. I liked how these were skipped in the next episode which, unfortunately, skipped the car modifications and this is the only GTA with bikes in it! And to date, in my opinion, this game has used the best voice actors in the series: Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Penn, Ice T and James Woods just to name a few. This is a classic and if you like the ""old"" GTA games but for some reason skipped this one now is to time to purchase it. Or when it's discounted as 10 bucks is a bit too much for such a title but I'm sure the price will soon drop.			"

												By its impact and overall features complexity, the greatest Grand Theft Auto title ever made. Yeah, even after the GTA V PC release. How's that, you may ask? Since when some junk based on the engine dated like 15 years away, is better than all the licked clean and glossy Euphoria engine stuff?Well, Euphoria is a good engine, sure, but not perfect. It's great with some physical effects, and all... But some things it can't do, while its competitors - can. Like when you need to exit the car and the doors are blocked, Euphoria still just respawns you outside the car. And Wei Shen from Sleeping Dogs will exit the car like he should - by smashing the front window with a kick and climbing out on the hood! And that's only one example! If you look around, you'll find many cool options that Rockstar haven't implied in their games, and that's really sad!But not when we're talking about San Andreas. For its main selling point at the moment is obviously not the visuals or engine complexity. No, people, it's all about the spirit, the mood that the game is providing. San Andreas - it's a raging youth, a bit crazy but overmighty and unstoppable. GTA 4 and GTA 5 - are quite different, and much more grim and unattractive by the same basis - the mood game's providing. Yeah, Luiz from the ""ballad of Gay Tony "" and Franklin from GTA V are slightly more cheerful guys you'll might even roll with someday... But Niko Bellic, Johnny Klebitz, Michael and Trevor - especially Trevor - they're all so horrid guys that I wouldn't like to walk the same road with. And it's the same thing as with the character from Mafia 1 in comparison with characters from Mafia 2 & 3! I just don't like those guys, I don't feel compassion for them - so I don't like to help them with sorting out their troubles, and so on.So there is the thing why San Andreas is better than GTA V. Compassion. Sympathy. Carl Johnson, being just the same mass murdering criminal as the whole other bunch of Rockstar characters, is still a better person to hang out with.And talking about the technical side, San Andreas even by the year of 2004 is tremendously big game. I've played it in 2005, in 2008, in 2011 and only the 4th time through I've found the triathlon event there. Stunning feeling.So, my mark is obvious 10/10, and not of some nostalgia, but just as the feeling after I've made it through GTA V, which I'll mark lower. Peace, people.			"

												Easily the best Grand Theft Auto, in my opinion. It has everything you could want in a GTA game. Gun variety, decent story, likeable characters, a nice balance between city, country, and desert, etc. There are also nice smaller touches, such as eating and being able to get fat, or not eat and get skinny over time. San Andreas also gives you the option to work out, an activity that has been abesnt to every other Grand Theft Auto since it's debut in San Andreas. The cities are one of the best parts of the game as well, IMO. You have the gang infested ghettos that is Los Santos, based off the real life Los Angeles. Red County and Flint County are your country sides, from Mount Chilliad and the Back o' Beyond to the small towns of Palomino Creek and Montomery. San Fiero, based off the real life San Francisco, has your fair share of narrow streets and steep hills, as well as some of the more interesting missions in the game. The final city unlocked in the game is Las Venturas, as well as the neighboring desert that is Bone County. Although your time in Bone County is short, you will experience some cool missions, some interesting individuals, and the dreading pilot school missions. Las Venturas on the other hand really shakes up the gameplay compared to the rest of the game, in terms of mission variety. Though Las Venturas has many sights to see, you'll likely be spending most of your time in the Strip.The only real cons with this game rest with the fact that some of the radio music has been removed because of licensing issues, and planes can be pretty tough to control unless you plan on playing with a controller. This is one of my favorite games of all time and I don't think I wouldn't recommend it anyone.			"

Well done, Rockstar...I have a lot of play time in this game and the latest update is rather depressing.What happened?It seems that Rockstar have decided to ruin this game by introducing a new patch which, quite essentially, breaks the game. Numerous songs have been removed from the game for licensing reasons (why not only remove them for new purchases?) and widescreen support is apparently gone as well as some resolution options?I managed to pause the download and create a backup of the game, I think I've lost the songs but I still have an old, slightly-modded exe which allows for 16:9 at 1080p and most importantly: the ability to load my old saves.What Rockstar did was callous, and unforgivable. This will definitely harm consumer confidence, but they probably don't even care.As much as I want to get GTA: V, I'll probably avoid it or wait until it's on sale a few years down the line. I mean, can we really trust Rockstar? What next? They downgrade GTA: IV?If you want to find out more about the latest patch, read the other reviews that go into detail and provide a removed song list.Also, if you really are thinking about buying this game, I wouldn't blame you if you ""find"" it available somewhere around the internet (I don't even support piracy, but in this case I'll make an exception).

												It's a great game, but damn the latest patch puts a sour taste in ones mouth. Rockstar removed radio tracks due to liscensing issues. Admitedly these changes are pretty minor, but they're in conflict with the game's core remaining audience.It's an old game. Folks who play old games like the idea of those games staying the way they were or not changing without their direct involvment (i.e. content/graphic mods). Furthermore, when they do make changes to their games they generally put content in rather than take it out as Rockstar has done here.On the side of rationality though, fans will probably unofficialy patch those tracks back in eventually and this version of the game now has 360 controller support.

												So yeah, this Steam version is really bad. I can't mod the damn game, so I can't play SA-MP if i wanted to because its not supported due to this stupid mandatory update. 18 songs have been removed, most of the resolution support is gone, and save files are deleted. What's funny is that they finally decided to update the game after 10 YEARS! I have an old CD copy of the game and guess what? Has everything they took away from us. I got my money back and I'm just using my old copy of the game in which is still in perfect condition. Don't buy this game on Steam, either find a copy on Ebay, or pirate the damn thing because this version is not worth it.			"

												My childhood mostly consisted of drawing, stuffing my face with sweets and of course, the PS2. At that time, I was given two games, both in the same series, being GTA: Vice City and of course, GTA: San Andreas which was pretty new for it's time. I instantly fell in love with both games, what with both of the game's poop-crazy storylines, well developed and memorable characters and of last but not least, the multiple crimes that will rack up those classic wanted stars! Sadly, I had lost this game a while back, due to moving and such and I was absolutely devastated. Looking for an alternative, I stumbled across Steam, with it's little miracle of putting the entire GTA series bundle on sale for an unbelieveably cheap price.	 I immediately smashed £20 into my steam wallet and hastefully slammed that purchase button and I've never looked back. This game astonished me, what with it's massive and immense game world it has. The chunk of data on that one compact disc still amazes me to this day.Going back to the hood, as Carl 'CJ' Johnson a young representant of the Grove Street Families, an African-American street gang and one of the oldest street gangs in Los Santos, San Andreas. ''After five years on the east coast, it was time to go home.'' was the exact words from CJ's mouth, as he arrived to pick up his luggage at the L.S Airport. His motive remaining clear, after he received a call before the planned flight from his older brother, detailing that their mother had been murdered by a mysterious hustler. Giving a warm welcome by his grieving older brother and sister, along with his two Grove Street comrades, Big Smoke and Ryder, you soon find yourself spraying graffiti, drive-by shooting, exploring the far and wide sprawling sun-drenched state of San Andreas, popping some caps in the asses of the corrupt ''bustas'', and of course putting other sworn rival gangs in their place.The gameplay on foot is top-notch. Interactivity with NPC's and overworld objects are very simple and the character animations are clear and very personified. Though the driving in this game is what I found a little problematic, what with the controls being a little messed up, but it's hardly noticeable over the irresistable charm the game has at it's repetoire.I definitely recommend a controller for this game. Since, it's argueable to say that again, I found the controls somewhat 'sloppyish' and a little finicky, with just using a mouse and keyboard.  All the while it does feel just right when using a PS3 controller, if you can wire that up to your PC's controller port. Truly adds to the nostalgic flare, since the reminiscence of both the Dualshock 2 and 3 controller.The only problem I've recently discovered is that a notorious patch has bestowed upon this classic game, thanks to Rockstar and now I believe that this game is now unmoddable and a handful of songs have been removed due to legal copyright reasons, which kinda sucks now.Now looking back, I still do recommend this game, but not so much for Steam now. Definitely either get it on the Playstation Store or the Xbox Live Marketplace.			"

												And then 2004 came, after 2001's GTA III and 2002's Vice City, the time came for San Andreas county to make his appereance. In GTA: San Andreas you will play as Carl ""CJ"" Johnson, one of GTA's most infamous protagonists. He comes back to Los Santos after he received a call telling him his mother died, and that's exactly where the story starts. In this new installment released in 2004 you will play not in one, not two but in three different cities located in San Andreas county: Los Santos which is modeled after Los Angeles, San Fierro which is modeled after San Francisco and Las Venturas, modeled after Las Vegas. Yes, Las Vegas got GTA'd and it's awesome. The San Andreas map was a huge achievement when it was released as it was one of the biggest the videogaming industry had ever seen until that point. But what was most surprising was that it was not as empty as one would believe, the map had several side-missions and activities to do. You could modify your character and make him fat, muscular or skinny. You could date girls. You could fight gang wars. You could rob houses. You could go to the gym. You could race in bikes. Or you could simply continue the story missions. As usual as with the other games, San Fierro and Las Venturas are blocked at the start, making Los Santos the only available area until you advanced through the story missions you could unlock the new areas and you could travel there. Otherwise you'd get a really nice 5 Stars Wanted Level if you dared to cross to the blocked areas. One of the most notable differences from previous videogames was the addition of an ability to the protagonist, and that was swimming. For the first time in GTA history a character could swim. Tommy Vercetti couldn't, Claude couldn't but CJ did it! Either way, this is one of the most fun installments in GTA history, rivaling the newest counterpart GTA V. If you don't have this game in your library, then you should by all means save to get this. Are you ready to order? Don't let Big Smoke order first or he's gonna empty the restaurant! 10/10Buy it, play it and don't regret it.			"

YES THEY DID!So basically they ''updated'' al lot of stuff in the last patch. In my opinion they just removed a ton of stuff like almost 10% of the orignal music, your previous save-games (even no luck if you have a back-up, It keeps starting a new game), 1080p support and the list goes on...Lucky for me I still got an old CD copy of the game from back in the days with the first version on it.

												Nice going, Steam/Rockstar, removing EVERY review for this game after a lot of negative reviews were posted. That's not censorship and damage control at all.Well, San Andreas is one of the best games ever. The Steam version of San Andreas IS NOT the game you played ten years ago though. This would certainly be a positive review, if not for the latest patch (November 7th 2014). That update has REMOVED 18 songs (including tracks from NWA, 2Pac, Rage Against The Machine, Ozzy Osbourne and Tom Petty) and HD support from a game you owned for years. Yes, you read that right. A patch removed content you PAID FOR when you bought the game. That such a thing is legal and was allowed by Steam, says a lot about the current state of the game industry. It sets a very dangerous precedent.Not only that, but the patch has also pretty much changed the game into the iOS/Android version - buggy, often crashing, with low resolution - and yet, bugginess is not as bad as REMOVAL OF CONTENT.While the game is pretty much the Game of the Decade for the '00s, I CANNOT with a pure conscience recommend it to anyone in the current state of affairs. I'd even go as far as saying that Rockstar has fallen down from one of the best game devs to EA-level.			"

												San Andreas is a third game in ""3D Universe"" which was heavily based on real-life events such as rivalry between Crips, Bloods and Hispanic gangs, crack epidemic, Los Angeles riots and severe police misconduct in LAPD which involved unprovoked beatings and shootings, stealing and dealing narcotics, planting of false evidence, frameups and bank robbery. It is one of the rare games that features black character as main protagonist. Besides San Andreas, I can only remember that The Suffering and GTA V did it.Map is almost four times bigger than its predecessor, and consists of 3 big urban areas Los Santos, San Fierro and Las Venturas which are inspired by Los Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas respectively. Countryside in game effectively serves as a 4th area due to its large size and diversity. There are many recognizable landmarks (which are named different) such as Area 51, Hollywood sign, Hoover Dam, Golden Gate bridge and many others.You play as Carl ""CJ"" Johnson, who returns to Las Santos after spending five years in Liberty City when he hears about his mother's murder. He finds his life very hard immediately upon arriving. Relationship with his brother ""Sweet"" is cold since he accuses him of leaving the family and friends. Crack addiction has affected many in his neighbourhood, and on top of that he gets on Frank Tenpenny's radar, a corrupt LAPD C.R.A.S.H. officer. Situation is grim, and he decides to rejoin his former gang, to get brother's approval and help making things better.Whole getto vibe and jargon are omnipresent, they are delivered through excellently written dialogs and voice acting. Besides CJ's Groove Street Families, other gangs include their arch enemies Ballas, Vagos and later in the game Vietnamese Da Nang Boys, Triads, Russians and three families of Italian Mafia.Gang wars becomes a thing later in the game when you need to defend your territory when enemy gang tries to take over. If you successfully do it, members of your gang will hang out in the area, and you can recruit them for helping you in missions. Stealth elements are also incorporated from Rockstar's previous game Manhunt; there are couple of missions which were specifically made with stealth in mind.Role-playing elements are new part of the series. You can visit the gym and learn hand-to-hand combat, work on your stamina by running or driving bike and build up your muscles by lifting weights. It has effect on your appearance which is important because you can date girls, and not all of them love the same thing. Muscles will open you a way to some of them, while others won't appreciate it at all, so you'll have to visit fast food restaurant to gain some fat. You can customize your looking by getting different haircuts, clothes, jewellry and tattoos.RPG elements that have effect on the gameplay are in driving and handling firearms. The more you drive certain type of vehicle or use specific weapon, the more you excel at it.Swimming and diving are also introduced, so you don't have to be afraid of water anymore. You can even pilot a plane after acquiring license for it. Bicycle, offroad vehicles such as tractors and combine harvesters, even jetpack and using parachutes are now on the table. There are driving, bike, boat and pilot schools which will help you learn many tricks.For those who love to hunt for hidden stuff, there is a plethora of it. Original 100 hidden packages are replaced with spray paint tags, but in addition to them there are hidden camera shots, horseshoes and oysters which will keep you preoccupied.My favorite side activities in the game were definitely street races and trucker missions. There are over twenty street races and they include cars, bikes and aircrafts. You are given specific vehicle for each of them and you compete against 5 AI opponents. They are absent in aircraft races, they just consist of getting through checkpoints in a certain amount of time.Eight trucking missions are separated into three types; delivering cargo within certain time limit, delivering illegal cargo whilst being pursued by a police with a three or four star rating and delivering a fragile cargo without damaging it. There are eight missions in total that successively become harder by having tighter time limits, stronger police attention or easily damaged cargo, all that by covering larger areas to reach destination. Last two missions are combination of fragile and timed objects as well as police attention, and can be quite challenging.There are 11 radio stations in the game with over 10 hours of material. My favovite one is WCTR; Rockstar is always spot on with satire used in talk shows and advertisements, laughing is therefore guaranteed.Voice cast lineup is led by phenomenal Samuel L. Jackson who gives voice to main antagonist. William Fichtner and Danny Dyer reprise their roles from Vice City as Ken Rosenberg and Kent Paul, while the rest of the cast include James Woods, David Cross, Peter Fonda, Wil Wheaton and many famous rappers.Game has sold over 27 million copies by 2011 and remains best-selling PS2 game of all time. It has been remastered and ported to many other platforms. It is the last game in ""3D Universe"", Rockstar launched a new canon (""HD Universe"") with GTA IV and GTA V.			"

												I have had many memories playing this game on the PlayStation 2. And I know the game is great, but this Steam port is a little damn sketchy. Let me break it down.-CLEO mods seem to be unsupported. (crashes the game upon savegame load)-The User Tracks do NOT work. (this crashes the game during gameplay)-Random crashes upon themselves.-A bunch of other problemsMoral of the story is; if you're going to port a game to PC for Steam, do it right. Other than that, this game was literally the best of it's time and went as far as being the best-selling game on the PlayStation 2. The story is AMAZING, the soundtrack fits the atmosphere of the game and the whole game is just awesome. But the Steam PC port? Not so much. I wish R* still released patches/fixes for the PC port but, of course, they are far too busy with ""other stuff"".Scores: PlayStation 2 version: 10/10Steam PC version: 8/10""So what are we supposed to do if the Ballas roll through?

												Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a flash game by Aval0nX . You are playing as Sonic the Hedgehog. Your across-the-street neighbor, Vanilla Rabbit, asks you to come over. She has a huge favor to ask you. She needs to go away for a week and can't take Cream with her. Amy is busy this week. Would you babysit Cream? She gives you the keys to the house, and money for expenses. She promises both of you ""BIG"" rewards when she comes back. As of right now there is a newer version called V093.The object of the game is to seduce Cream the Rabbit into as many sex acts as possible. Your score is based on the number of times you manage each of the following:Showered with CreamSlept with CreamGroped CreamCream gives you a blow jobJerked off on CreamHad sex with CreamUsed the Carrot toy on CreamMade Cream ♥♥♥			"

												Unfortunately, as amazing a game as this is, I cannot in any good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.First, if you've come from having this game on the Playstation 2 (as many of us have) and want a digital version to play on your pc, don't. Just download an emulator and use the PS2 disc. The main reason I say this is that the most recent update has not only removed 16:9 resolutions from the game entirely (despite a previous patch fixing 1920x1080p resolution) but they have also removed many of the songs which made this game's soundtrack absolutely iconic.Songs removed from which stations:RADIO XOzzy Osbourne - HellraiserRage Against The Machine - Killing In The NameK-DSTJoe Cocker - Woman To WomanPLAYBACK FMUltramagnetic MCs - Critical BeatdownBOUNCE FMThe Gap Band - You Dropped a Bomb On MeFatback Band - Yum Yum (Gimme Some)Roy Ayers - Running AwayRADIO LOS SANTOSN.W.A. - Express Yourself2Pac - I Don't Give A F*ckK-JAH WESTBlood Sisters - Ring My BellBlack Harmony - Don't Let It Go To Your HeadMASTER SOUNDS 98.3Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band - Express YourselfThe Blackbyrds - Rock Creek ParkThe J.B.'s - GruntMaceo & The Macks - Soul Power '74James Brown - The PaybackSo as you can see, a lot of superb songs were removed, and the only good thing to come from this update? Xbox 360 controller support... which in consideration, isn't worth the tradeoffs. I'd rather stick with MKB and keep all my songs.The only actions I can recommend regarding this game is to go onto Amazon and buy a new copy of the game (£4.99 at the time of this post(£5 cheaper than this poor excuse for a game)) and while your 1080p res will still be broken, it will exist, and you'll have the full compliment of the original songs.The only downside to this? You have to have the disc in the disc drive to play it. I can live with that though, considering what's been done to the digital version.Or you could just pirate the game.			"

												Hang on, hang on. Put your pitchforks away and hear me out for a sec.I love this game. This was the game that changed gaming back when people were mad that you played as someone not white. I played this game from hours to days on end and it is still one of the best games out there.Unfortunetly a recent patch destroyed it in multiple ways, the main reasons being...1. Due to Rockstar's legal papers expiring they removed all music from the game. Rock, Paper, Shotgun  goes into it a bit better than I can.2. This created an odd bug with some of the cars causing cars to... act up or bug out I guess.3. The update destroyed all save files. It wouldn't matter if your buying it but still.4. For whatever reason the resolution was messed up and now ""don't quote me on this one"" you can't play at 1080p and the game wasn't made to be played at a lower resolution making it look like sh*t.Overall I have to say, WTH. I mean this isn't going to remove the songs on Xbox or ps2. And the songs are still on all mobile copies of gta. So why only pc? *sigh* Rockstar. I'm somewhat scared if they are going down the same path as Ubisoft with the bad choices they're making and their 'Social Club' you need to sign up to play newer Rockstar games.In the end, your better off getting this game on mobile, witch is an odd thing to say for me because I hate mobile gaming but any smartphone can now play it, so might as well. Or hook up your dusty ps2 and go shoot hookers in flying cars over area 52.			"

												It has an interesting story with funny characters and though it's quite dated, still the best GTA ever. There's collectibles, stunt jumps, you can rob people at night, no drowning like in previous titles and pickups across the map ensure you can have fun without using cheats or being forced to save money. There is a multiplayer mod that I personally recommend, MTA (Multi Theft Auto) for it's network stability and simplicity as well as not requiring any overwrites so you can keep single and multiplayer separate! :D  I haven't even finished it yet, but I'm sure I'll have plenty to do after the story. (Map is a bit smaller than GTA5's, but still huge.)The best thing about older games: Anyone can run it easily. or almost anyone... You just need a PC from early 2000's or newer. 90's and older obviously can't. Sadly, GTA 3 and Vice City haven't aged so well. I always hated drowning too...I can't really think of any cons, so 9/10. I save 10's for the absolute best games with crazy high replay values. Battlefield 3 and Left 4 Dead 2 are good examples, but it's just my opinion.			"

												I loveddd this game to death, and it still remains one of my favorite games if not my favorite GTA. It's one of the first games I sunk over 100 hours into, and even more so with the many user mods released over the last decade or so, including two multiplayer ones and the CLEO mods. I figured I'd grab it on Steam a couple years back for convenience instead of continuing to use my scratched up disc copy. But a recent major patch for this game actually strips away content rather than add any. It has removed 1920x1080 support, 17 songs from the great soundtrack (most likely because of expired royalty/copyright), and replaces most of original menu/HUD with the mobile version similar to the recent Android/iOS releases of this game. You can find the full list of changes elsewhere.I only wrote this as a warning to any friends who may not be aware of this recent change and add a negative review to that column on the Steam store page. I'm fully aware how old/irrelevant this game may be at the time of this review.			"

												The original version of San Andreas was one of my favorite games to play long time ago. Now not anymore. Why? Rockstar screwed it up by replacing the original verison with iOS port,,, Seriously what... Why? So stupid.The port version is absolutely terrible. Lacking graphics options. Modding abilities are removed! Yes, removed... A lot of great music got taken out. It looks more cartoony than before. It does not feel San Andreas anymore. Extremely disappointing.At least I still have an original PS2 copy of San Andreas and thanks god for the AMAZING Grand Theft Auto V port... Now that GTA V version is the best version out there over all other console versions. Don't buy this game ever. Go buy GTA V instead. Original San Andreas version: 9 out of 10Now: 5 out of 10			"

												This game is in my opinion still one of the great games that has ever been created and I would love to see it getting a remake like TES V: Skyrim is supposed to receive in the near future. Gameplay-wise it sure has it's flaws like some weird physics (it's an old game so.. duh). But all in all I would recommend it to everyone searching for a good old sandbox shooter. Or people who wanna do some crazy stuff since this is probably the game with the most cheats (and the weirdest ones) I've seen to date. The only negatives I could see in this version are - Low Rider challanges seem to have reversed vertical controlls (Means: The arrow on the screen tells you to press ""up"" but you have to press ""down""The most annoying thing for me is not the game's fault, Because it's the censorship. As a German I have to deal with the probably most annoying censorship worldwide. I don't even care about heads not exploding when you shoot them with a sniper rifle or not being able to beat up corpses (Why do people actually wanna do that anyways?) What bugs me is that they removed the money drops when killing people. I see that they are trying to prevent people maybe thinking ""If I kill some stranger on the road I get rewarded!"" but damn.

												This was one or maybe even my favorite game of all time... AND YOU RUINED IT! The game crashes a lot, I find myself having to run all the way back to a save point after every mission from being scared of the game crashing.Some things just don't work - For some reason the cars just break all the time when you're not pressing the gas (not as in slow down, but actually break) Water plane (Skimmer) will barley move, probably to do with the random always breaking if no gas. Textures are just messed up. Some times CJ starts flickering, and cars are at times driving backwards?PLEASE ROCKSTAR FIX THE GAME.tl;dr Rockstar you done ♥♥♥♥ed up with the remaster. "

												Over the years Rockstar Games has continually downgraded the quality of the Steam version of this product. Because of this, I cannot recommend the Steam version of Grand theft auto: San Andreas upon download.Poor Business Decisions● Resolutions Above 1680x1050 Are Not Supported. Upon first downloading Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, resolutions above 1650x1050 are not supported. If you would like to go higher, you will need to download an older version of the gta-sa.exe.● No Steam achievements. Users of the Steam service have been lobbying for Steam achievements for San Andreas for years. Here we are, almost 10 years later (at the time of writing this review) and there's still no Steam achievements. The slap in the face is that Rockstar Games released an ""HD"" remake of San Andreas in 2014 for Xbox 360 with achievements.● 2014 ""Update"" Savegame Incompatibility Issue. On the 7th of November 2014 Rockstar released a ""patch"" that not only removed 19 songs for all users who legally purchased the game, they made all game saves created before that patch incompatible with that version, corrupting them along the way. This is quite serious as some individuals invest hundreds and in some cases thousands of hours into their save files only to have them get corrupted. Then again, you would think anyone that spends hundreds if not thousands of hours on their save would have backups, wouldn't you? This brings up the question if they're going to pull this stunt with Grand Theft Auto IV or Grand Theft Auto V a few years down the road.● Controversial Removal of 19 Songs Featured In The Original Release of The Game!On the 7th of November, 2014 Rockstar Games removed nineteen songs featured in the original version of the game, released on the 7th of June, 2005. The controversial business descision is that they didn't leave these tracks in the game for the users who have legally purchased this product before the 7th of November. So to this into perspective, Rockstar Games has essentially removed a great deal of content that users of the Steam service have legally paid for.Additional Information:When Grand theft auto: Vice City's music licenses were about to expire back in December of 2012, Rockstar Games removed the licensed songs from the game but allowed every user who purchased Grand theft auto: Vice City before December to keep their songs.List of Tracks Removed From The Steam Version:Bounce FMRunning Away - Roy AyersYou Dropped A Bomb On Me - The Gap BandYum Yum - The Fatback BandKDSTRunning Down A Dream - Tom PettyWoman to Woman - Joe CockerK-JAH West RadioDon’t Let It Go to Your Head - Black HarmonyRing My Bell - Blood SistersMaster Sounds 98.3Express Yourself - Charles WrightRock Creek Park - The BlackbyrdsFunky President - James BrownSoul Power ‘74 - Macer & The MacksThe Payback - James BrownGrunt - The JB’sPlayback FMCritical Beatdown - Ultramagnetic MC’sRadio Los SantosI Don’t Give A f*ck - 2 PacHood Took Me Under - Compton’s Most WantedExpress Yourself - NWARadio:XHellraiser - Ozzy OsbourneKilling in the Name - Rage Against the MachineI cannot recommend this product here on Steam and heavily recommend going elsewhere to obtain this product.

												The first law of gaming is that a video game must first and foremost have fun and this Grand Theft Auto San Andreas does ... and does it very well.The title is improved a lot compared to the previous episode, while presenting a linear plot, without much intrigue and twists; many sub-main missions (those wonderful stealth to recover some powerful weapons, or the music game-positioned to play in your car stereo stolen with a ball), so the various locations and different approaches to situations (you can, for to impress even get tattooed images on the body), make this unique title, despite being in effect a PC-game.The more than one hundred missions lead to use of the product for an average of about sixty hours of play, a time worthy of the best Final Fantasy.Our part venal takes over but we must admit that the sixty euro for GTA San Andreas are worth all, a title that will please those who waited for months now, who drooled over pictures and those who grew up in the 90s; after all graphics, sound and gameplay mixed for good are the true essence of the game is not it?

												While San Andreas in itself is a good game, I cannot recommend the Steam version of the game due to the update they released over a year or so ago now.Reasons being:- Game is alot more unstable, crashes more than GTA IV.- Mouse will randomly not work for no reason i.e. not being able to move the camera being a crucial thing in the game. Along with that I can't use weapons when the mouse doesn't work and the default keybinds in this version are horrendous.- Lack of 16 by 9 resolutions, though I seem to have 1280x720 and 1600x900 resolutions.- No intro video, not a game breaking thing but why remove it from the newer version I have no idea.- Some music removed from the game. This is unstandable due to licensing issues, again nothing game breaking, although it is for me as sometimes entering cars will make the game crashBefore the update the game ran perfectly fine, if you really want to get this game, try and pick up a retail copy second hand somewhere, that way, it is ""optional"" to have updates on the game. Thank Steam for removing the option to not update games. Did I forget to mention this is a mobile port?			"

In a recent update, Rockstar removed 18 songs, removed the option for 1080p and also deleted the save data for anyone who had played it before the update. You can't stop the update or even play the game until the update is complete.Seek out a physical copy, which could be easily found online for very cheap!It would of been nice for Rockstar to renew the licences for these songs, with all the success they have gotten from GTA 5.

												Frankly, GTA: San Andreas is the game which got me interested in the franchise. Extremely well-written, expansive, innovative and incredibly fun. CJ is one of the strongest characters Rockstar has ever developed, along with the rest of the character list. The voice acting is incredibly well-done, the music selection is (or was) second only to GTA: Vice City in my opinion. The variety of things you can do in this game is arguably second-to-none in the entire franchise, which helps Rockstar in its portrayal of a truly open world.The graphical stylings, while outdated by today's standards, still please the eye and many parallels can be seen between this game's environment and that of Grand Theft Auto V's more recent version of Los Santos which I can't help but think about as I play this game. GTA V's environmental design would undoubtedly have suffered in my opinion had Rockstar not made GTA: SA previously.Overall, I'd consider it a must-play for anyone interested in sandbox games, GTA as a franchise or... hell, historically notable games. This game is widely considered one of the best of all time, which makes sense, considering it was the best-selling PlayStation 2 game ever.However, the Steam version has just been updated (after several years with no updates whatsoever), and there are a few unfortunate setbacks I have to point out for people who are considering buying the Steam version. Years ago, Rockstar updated GTA: SA for Steam with version 3.0. Among some bugfixes and miscellaneous improvements, the patch somehow inexplicably broke 16:9 resolution support entirely. This problem is still around in the latest patch, which, if you're like the majority of PC owners these days and have a 16:9 widescreen monitor, will mean you will encounter letterboxing and a lower resolution than your monitor is capable of rendering. Only with an unofficial modification can you get around this, and it's deeply disturbing that Rockstar still hasn't noticed this problem yet.Alongside this, Rockstar, apparently pressured by music publishers whose tracks they licensed for GTA: SA's soundtrack, has removed somewhere around 20 tracks from the game entirely. This was done retroactively, meaning that previous owners of the game before the latest patch, like myself, have no choice but to play the game now without musical content they purchased. If you don't play GTA games for the radio stations, this may not impact you as much, but regardless, Rockstar's approach to enforcing licensing restrictions with this patch was in my opinion heavy-handed at best, criminally deceptive at worst. It can set a precedent for AAA publishers to unilaterally remove content at will, and while the change of content with/without notice is disclosed in most games' EULAs these days, that just doesn't work in an economic system where one pays for the ownership of a good.Some of the artists in this game I first found out about thanks to GTA: San Andreas, including Helmet, Rage Against The Machine, NWA, Eazy-E, Ice Cube and Public Enemy, and it's a little heart-breaking that the game no longer reflects my childhood memories of it after a decade, with some of my favorite songs conspicuously absent. These are songs everyone who bought the game before the update paid for.Rockstar hasn't even mentioned the update at all on their website (par for the course, though, they're very sporadic with their PR), or on the News page on Steam for the game, so I'm not sure whether or not they were even going to announce this. We shall see what happens.I will be fair and include the latest patch's implementation of (apparent) DRM-free implementation and XInput control support, however. The XInput implimentation is not perfect but still playable and hopefully it is beneficial to people accustomed to GTA console controls. Basically, if you try using an Xbox 360 controller's triggers for throttle control for vehicles similarly to GTA IV you've got your work cut out for you, as all inputs besides the thumbsticks are treated as digital buttons including the triggers. This makes it very difficult to regulate the speed of your vehicle in my personal experience, which is extremely important in multiple missions. Other than performing steering with thumbsticks, I gained absolutely nothing in playablility because of this but was still capable of beating the game.It's due to these less-than-ideal changes to the game, as playable as it still is, that I cannot recommend you purchase the Steam version of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, because at the end of the day you get less content than you would have had a week ago for the same price (at the time of writing) and have no choice in the matter. You owe it to yourself to find an original retail version with the soundtrack and resolution compatibility completely intact, at least then you won't be forced to update the game according the whims of music industry executives.(As the update to the game was very recent and may change in the future, I will accordingly update this review if things develop further.)

												★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Still the best open-world game to date.You play as Carl Johnson, an ex-gangbanger that moved to Liberty City to live the good life. After years away from his old mates, he goes back to Los Santos to attent to his mother's, only to find himself back into the life he desperately wanted to get away from.Unlike Grand Theft Auto III and Vice City, the gameplay hasn't aged at all. Anyone who played IV or V will know what to expect, as it is the basis for every new GTA title. You can climb anything you want, look anywhere you want without the camera bothering you, interact with pedestrians, climb a mountain with a bike and much, much more. It's not about what you can do, it's about what you can't do. As this is the first 3D open-world game ever to have multiple cities, it leaves a lot to be expected. Fortunately, it does not disappoint. The cities (Los Santos, San Fierro and Las Venturas) are incredibly huge and detailed, fiddled with minigames, side-activities and crazy characters to spice up the formula. All accompanied by a large countryside for you to look for the Bigfoot explore.When you attach all that with an awesome licensed soundtrack that takes cues from dozens of different genres with the voice of Samuel L. Jackson himself, you realize that this is a game like no other. The world that Rockstar created using this engine feels like a living charicature of 90's USA, even if it's held back by the game's primitive visuals. It's just one of those rare videogames that everyone just needs to experience atleast once in their lifetime. I still find myself in awe from time-to-time with the outstanding atmosphere the state of San Andreas provides.			"

												Lets get this out of the way; the current, non altered state that the game is in is entirely unacceptable. Rockstar's decission with the latest ""patch"" is very much a slap in the face as well as running contrary to what they did when Vice City found itself in a similar situation (expiring music licenses). It is inexcusable and needs to be fixed.That being said, the game in it's present state is likely unplayable for a myriad of reason. The recent update is effectivly forcing you to use the same 'HD' version they was released for mobile devices, which gives you texture issues and problems with 1080p resolutions (not to mention broken controller and mouse support).To actually play this game, you are now forced to downgrade it to a previous version.The game itself, all current issue aside, is still a classic GTA game for a reason. And if you can get a non-Steam version or just simply downgrade this one, it is worth your time to play. However, I will not recommend buying this game until Rockstar either fixes the things they broke with the latest ""patch"" or issues an apology for how this was handled. If this is how they treat an older game, what's to stop them from doing the same with GTA IV or V?EDIT: I feel I should clarify, in case someone sees my playtime and calls it into question. I have owned this game on the PS2 for many, many years and have sunk many hours into that version. So yes, I am experienced with this game, but have only recently gotten it for the PC for various reasons (mostly my being lazy and it having been gifted to me by a friend who got it from preordering GTA:V).

												The game itself is very awesome and has much fans and players even nowdays, but the things are that that've made it worse in the latest patch.There ARE good side of it: it now supports new OS (windosw 7, 8(.1) are working good).But what's the cost! The main thing i've noticed is realy weird video mode. it now supports only few resolutions and all are not bigger then 1280x768. The next thing i've noticed is a crash from the main manu as you try to go into ""advanced"" video settings. this way I cant setup a normal resolution. Some folks also report such stuff like missing songs, textures and so on. The thing is that they've put a silly port from Xbox 360 into steam instead of the original PC version. This sux much.Upd: It is possible to tune a normal resolution with a third-party patch (""SilentPatch"")			"

												Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas takes us to the city of San Andreas, which is loosely modeled after California. You play as Carl Johnson, former banger for Grove Street, who returns to Los Santos in San Andreas after several years.In San Andreas, the gang warfare system, is an interesting addition, allowing you to control territory and push out rival gangs. San Andreas has more of a focus on building the Grove Street gang into an empire, which was different from the way Vice City played. The soundtrack is pretty cool and there are newer features from previous GTA titles, such as muscular changes as you build stamina, or gaining weight from eating. San Andreas has a great storyline, memorable dialogue, and a kick ♥♥♥ jetpack you can steal and fly around on. Graphically it is better than Vice City, but not as smooth looking as GTA IV.  Though it is 10-years old, It is still fun to play and worth your time if you are a fan of the series. If you play or have played GTA V, you will undoubtedly recognize some landmarks from San Andreas.			"

												Yeah, thanks Valve, and thanks Rockstar, for saving me money next February. I was going to buy Grand Theft Auto V on the PC, more than likely using Steam, more than likely at full/fool price,  but if you are pulling this completely idiotic, nonsensical, stupid, backwards, meshugenah, daft, silly and completely foolish garbage on a game I already bought and paid for, one of my favourite all-time games ever, you can forget about it.  Break the resolution all you want, that's fine. I don't run with the original Steam version of the gtasv.exe because I live in the second decade of the twenty first century and high resolution, 1080p gaming is what I'm used to, and there's a warez app for that. But removing all those songs? Because Rockstar is too flat out lazy to pay the license fees on them? There are no words for that that aren't obscene in four languages. Game updates are meant to make games better. Not worse. You bloody idiots.			"

												This game got me into Grand Theft Auto and into sandbox games in general. I loved this game so much I played it through, completely, unmodded, twice in a row (I never do that).I used to hang out with gang members so, living the life through CJ brought back memories of good times and bad times. I grew up with rap music eventually moving to rock and metal. I loved the soundtrack!Fortunately, GTA: SA is not rooted in reality and that's what made it so fun. Ever see gangbangers flying military jets and jet packs? Exactly!Another thing I loved about this game was that they took three big cities (based on three real-life big cities) and put them on one map and then put life all in between them.This was such a fantastic game and there's so much to say. But now.... (read the reviews below)I will say this, we all should have seen this coming.			"

												Rockstar's recent unannounced patch that they released to the PC version of the game has ruined the game for me.What are the damaging changes, you may ask?-Multiple songs have been removed from the game's soundtrack (Id assume this is caused by expired licenses, which is something i could understand)-Removed higher resolution options. I believe this was an issue back in the day, which got the game updated with higher resolution options, why on earth would they remove this later?-All save games prior to this patch are no longer usable. If you try to load a save prior to the patch, the game will start off new and fresh. And oh lookie, me who spent hours and hours trying to get 100% and finally did it, until a month later the save gets destroyedThe only GOOD thing this hidden patch gave was simple controller supportI would recommend anyone to refrain from buying this off steam, and grabbing an old CD instead, that doesnt get sudden patches 9 years after releaseEDIT:It seems that this version crashes or freezes more often during loadingI ended up losing 30 minutes of progress because the game had frozen, and this has happend 3 times now			"

												Simply one of the best games ever made. If you haven't played it, you haven't lived. If you have played it, you know exactly what I'm about to say and you shouldn't even be reading this, you should be out there playing this game.Openworld, missions, a good storyline, silliness, seriousness, activities, weapons, driving, there's SO much you can do in this game. Want some excitement? Go for a good race (with or without cops chasing you),. Want some sightseeing instead? Drive through the countryside or the cities. Not too excited for all the freeroam? Doesn't matter, play the story instead, which is amazing and pretty long too. You'll never get bored in this game, and if you do, you can always install SA:MP or MTA and play this game multi with some friends and try some fun little gamemodes :)			"

												The Grand Theft Auto series is like comfort food. It's one I've always been able to go to for reliably charming characters, enthralling story and gameplay, with presented moments leaving me curious to dive in and see what's new and exciting.San Andreas is not an exception to this! In fact, in my books, it defines those exact values.As far as the story goes, the protagonist returns to his hometown, where he then finds his family and friends going downhill. Then framed by two high-ranking and corrupt policemen, he's on the run getting into all sorts of hijinks and shenanigans, traveling far and wide meeting and getting involved with all sorts of interesting characters!Simply navigating the variety of environments in the vehicles provided feels good. The weight of the cars is just right and though the friction their wheels provide against the ground could be called a little slidey and difficult to maintain, it's rewarding to feel yourself master the way it works as the game progresses, both through in-game stats and your own technical ability. The gunplay isn't anything too special, but every weapon does what it should and there's one or a few in every expected category (though some are definitely outside of what you'd expect) for getting the job done and more.There is absolutely no shortage of missions, and while some can be stubborn, every one is fun in premise. It's important to be careful, because any one mistake no matter the size can screw the whole gig over and cause you a lot of time! On missions where you're driving somebody important, which there are many of, flipping the car upside-down will cause it to catch on fire and, in time, explode. The person inside won't leave, and instead will sit there waiting for their demise, giving you a long time to think about how much they must hate you and an even longer time to think about how much you hate them. If you fail a mission, to try again you must make it all the way back in the world to the starting point... and this can lead to awkward and tedious situations, since some missions can take you pretty far away from where you began. Not to mention that if death is the cause of defeat, you'll lose all your guns and some of your cash you could use to help get them back! Any indoor segments can be clunky and frustrating, with the game's on-foot mechanics of navigation and battle noticeably designed overall to work better outdoors. It adds a good amount of pressure to not screw up when you know things can go wrong at any time, but it can be hard to keep sane when half your mistakes can be so easily blamed on the game!With missions put to the side, there's still much to play with outside of them. The world is full of things to do like play basketball, pool, or arcade games; you can go racing, disco dancing, gambling, or do some work as a paramedic... and that's just the start! The protagonist can change and be customized in many different ways: you can fatten him up with junk food, buff him up at the gym, get him tattooed at the tattoo shop, change his clothes to your liking, or take him to the barber for a trim! (Or an afro, seemingly straight out of nowhere?) While one of the few things you can't change about him is what he says and how he acts, throwing him in a pair of boxers with hearts on them as he goes about his business will seem to change his tone a bit. On a bit of the downside, there are a lot of collectibles, with no clues as to where they would be, all over the place in odd locations. This is an absolute pain to anybody who's picky about getting everything done, but resources can be found online which list the location of every one, and if it's not something important to you then know that you're not missing out on much! All rewards are something nice to have, but are pretty much all superfluous, as you can already obtain just about everything they offer otherwise. (There are a few exclusives, but still, they're nothing fun or exciting, only helpful, so don't worry!)For the age of the game, the graphics stand up well to the test of time. Not in their realism, but in the style they are consistently represented in. Everything is solid from one thing to another, and the world is beautiful to look at from every angle, though it shines especially when everything can be seen complimenting one another at once from a distance! Indoors the attention to detail can be lacking, especially in some of the mission-exclusive locations, but you'll be finding yourself outside most of the time anyhow, and it's nothing that will break the experience when you aren't.The soundtrack consists of licensed tracks, and is represented through the different radio stations you'll hear while driving, which offer from one to another a good selection of just about anything anybody could be into. It sticks true to the early nineties setting, the list of tracks being full of nothing but memorable songs! Each radio station has commercials brimming with heavy satire, alongside an eccentric disc jockey who chimes in every now and again. There's no shortage of both hit classics and hidden gems which anybody should be happy to hear again or to be introduced to. It's all top-notch, and compliments the time you'll spend in cares quite well! Even if you don't like what's presented, since this is the PC version of the game you can add your own tracks into the game if you'd like, which will have their own radio station.For anybody new to the series, I'd suggest this being the place to start. To get through the story alone takes fifty to sixty hours, but if that seems like a bit much, don't worry! It'll be hard to notice the time flying by when there's so much fun to be had. With a wide variety of weapons, vehicles, side-games, and a gigantic world to play with all you find and gain within, the game lives up well to the title of the series, which even outside of context gets to the point: it's grand, there's theft, and loads of auto! ...Auto meaning, y'know, automobiles...

You have no rights to pull it out from under us without even a warning that the update would do so. If you warned me that this patch would remove 17 music tracks, 1080p video mode and save data, I would not have accepted.If anyone from rockstar or steam are actually reading these comments, I can assure you that I'm going to contact trading standards and citizens advice ASAP to see if this is even legal in UK law.

PROS:+ amazing & awesome story+ cool soundtrack+ really great gameplay & combat+ TONS of side missions+ character customization+ vehicle customization+ you can finally swim+ no Rockstar Games Social ClubCONS:- compatibility issues with newer OS- lots of glitches - audio, graphic- mouse control issues- game freezing in menusComment:No I have not made a mistake, I DO believe this game is fantastic, but I DO NOT recommend this game on Steam. The game itself is amazing although with a few issues. The most apparent issues are with compatibility, mostly on Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10. Problems ranging from audio and graphic glitches ... screen/game freezing .. to mouse controls not working properly. Same as in Vice City. But you could expect these for an old game and many (if not all) can be fixed by adding fixes, workarounds and mods. Now I remember how my friend bought me this game over a decade ago. The huge amount of content ... cool story ... I had lots and lots of fun. To this day I still own the DVD and I even got my girlfriend to play it. And she loved it too. So I thought I would have digital copy just in case something happens with my DVD. An added bonus is also that you do not have to deal with RGSC in this game. But just like Vice City it suffers from licensing and how Rockstar treats digital distribution of games. Because you DO NOT OWN IT when you buy it here, you just borrow it. They change the game when they wish and as recent events have shown they can remove stuff. Songs, options, fixes and in this way also all of the mods made throughout the years. In this case they swapped it with a mobile port entirely. And this will go on in the future. So as time goes your copy of the game on Steam gets worse and worse ... while old disk copies (like mine) and even pirated versions remain the best quality available. THIS is why I do not recommend buying it here. Which is a shame because it is one of the best games I have ever played and mods just made it even better. Most of those mods got invalidated when they switched the normal version with this clumsy port. Yes, you can download files to return it back to how it was. But then what is the point of having a legal digital copy if you need third-party files. Very very disappointing. Also this review and a TON of others were pushed away to erase the ""Mostly Negative"" score on Steam, real classy Rockstar & Valve...			"

												Real life isn't real, GTA:SA is real life!  This game will improve your real life gangsta skills!  I purchased GTA:SA and listed it on my application for my local street gang and voila! I became a low-level gang member risking years of imprisonment for less than minimum-wage!  Life is so great now!The 'fo rizzle' review:  It's a good game.  Graphics are obviously dated, but honestly not that bad considering when this was made.  Install some of the graphics enhancement mods and it's even better.  There is no first-person, only third (driving has a bumper view).  Controls can be a little 'wonky' at times, but again, that's to be expected for an old game and it does not take anything away from the overall experience.(Some people experience a bug where the character moves forward constantly.  A few found the problem to be a virtual controller in the Device Manager to be the cause - disabling should solve that.  Look to the forums for a detailed solution.  All I had to do was unplug my joystick and steering-wheel.  Either way, easy fix.)Basically you're a gangster who does gangster things:  kill, rob, drive-bys, etc.  You run with the Grove-Street gang while gaining ""respect"" and moving up the ranks.  At some point, you'll be able to control territories and expand your gang's influence while defending the turf you have.  There is a decent story line which I won't go into, along with multiple girlfriends you can date if you choose to.  Rival gangs chase and shoot at you; police chase you after committing crimes; paint your car to lose your wanted status or simply hide out and wait for it to go away.  If you've played other GTA titles, then it's all very familiar.I played this as a kid and it brought back good memories.  There are a couple of software 'updates/mods' you'll want to install to make the game run better.  To play higher resolutions (ex. 1980x1280, etc.), you'll definitely need these updates/mods - simple to install.  They can be found on others' reviews.Purchased during the July 4th sale (around $3.00) and well worth it!  Rated 8/10 stars.			"

												Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.. come on, do I even need to review this? This game takes you on a journey of a young adult by the name of Carl Johnson who receives news of his mother's passing and as a result he goes on to find the person who did this.Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, for its time, is a phenominal game. While I did play this during my younger years, I don't think I'm looking at it with nostalgic goggles. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is packed full of content, features and things to do. Many of which are not even found in newer titles such as Grand Theft Auto V. The world is rich in life, variety and constrast between areas. Again, who would've imagined such a gaming world back in 2004? I certainly didn't, and I was peeing myself seeing Half-life 2.I don't know what more to say, this game is what it is.. that's why I questioned myself why did I need to review it, it's simply amazing. Everyone needs to try this game.			"

												Rockstar recently updated the game; well, I shouldn't say ""updated"", I should say ""replaced"". They replaced the game with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mobile port that the 360 got. This new port has a reduced song count, worse performance than the original port it replaced, and the resolution options have been crippled. On the bright side of things, you can now OFFICIALLY use your 360 gamepad, instead of spending two minutes setting up an easy-to-use and free third party program that offers literally more benefits than GTA:SA native gamepad support. If you do end up buying this, make sure you get the unofficial patch to revert the game back to its 1.0 version, which also supports mods.			"

I can maybe understand a little due to copyright but still, the music was what made my long driving in Gta: San Andreas worthwhile, and they took out 18 songs (18!!!). They also deleted all my saved files (which included one where i was more than halfway through the game, it took forever) now i have to start all over with 18 songs cut out. The only thing worthwile from this patch is that now it supports Xbox 360 controllers, thats it. other than that its abyssmal. Now i have to replay all of GTA: San Andreas on a dumbed down version.

												Absolutely great game......before the recent patch that removed songs, broke saved games, made mods incompatible, limits available resolutions and so on. I would be even willing to let removing of the songs slide since its the music industry that screws everybody there, but why mess around where it is not needed? This is a mobile version now, so you might as well buy it on iOS or Android if thats enough for you.For the PC I recommend getting it *cough* elsewhere *cough* with all the original songs and moddability intact. You can use SAAC and / or Pinnacle game profiler to map gamepads to work better with the game than you can with this newly released abomination.Thanks Rockstar!By the way, my playtime on Steam copy is so low because I've used downgraded exe for mods.

												This game was great, the last update ruined it in a lot of ways, the frame limiter turned off causes game breaking bugs, and with the limiter on the game looks horrible. They removed songs from a game i already bought, which seems very wrong to me. The last update supposedly gave us a different version from a mobile port or something, i dont really care. I had a great review for this game before the update trashed it. Whether it is Rockstar or Valve or Steam who is to blame i dont know, but this issue has brought up the scary idea of publishers going back and removing liscensed content from games in your library. beyond that fear, the console versions of gta san andreas got full HD versions, PC did not, it will not play in true 1080 and is overall much worse. I fear the success of console games has made developers stop valueing their pc customers.Terrible treatment of fans and customers.			"

There is no law that forces or even allows any company to retroactively steal music from customers who legally purchased it while the copyright license was still active.Putting up a new copy of the game online so that new customers don't get the expired songs music is how this should have been handled, but they had no right to remove the songs from copies that were legally purchased by the end user while the license was still active. I can't believe they would be this stupid and lazy.It's no different than if they illegally hacked your X-box to remove access to the songs from the hard copy of the game or if a music company hacked your computer to erase some MP3 files that you bought and downloaded because the publisher lost the license for some of the songs on it.This was illegal for Rockstar to do, there is no licensing law that forced or even permitted them to do this. This move was entirely on them and I expect they will have a class action lawsuit on them for it in the near future.Regardless of what they would like to believe, no ELUA makes it legal for them to do this. The enforcability of many ELUA elements is already questionable, but this is actual theft and the ELUA agreement will not protect them in this case.			"

												Personally my favorite GTA, with one of the most diverse game worlds ever created. I could write a giant essay on this one game and how awesome it is. Only problem is that this is the Steam version we're talking about, which removed a lot of songs that helped give this one the personality that it achieved more then 10 years ago. Don't buy this version unless you're willing to snoop around the forums or the web to find a downgrader, patch, etc.			"

												Grand Theft Auto: San AndreasStory - One of the best campaigns I've ever played. Not going to say anything at all because it will spoil it. Just play it! Story is just. Amazing. 10/10Storyline Length - Around 10 hours. A day or so.AI - Fun to play with, not too hard to kill, not to easy to fight against. It's great. 10/10Experience - At times, you'll laugh way too hard, you'll call Big Smoke a fat ♥♥♥♥, you'll look for Bigfoot because of those fake myth videos, you'll cry at the end. Simply amazing. *The one thing I hate (it's my PC's fault, not taking away points) is that the car brakes by itself. And I don't like turning frame limiter on. 10/10Graphics - Erm. It's a game from 2004 or something, so I really can't complain. All I'm gonna say is that it looks good enough. I love how cars have a lot of detail in them. And the Mod shop for the cars! That's one of the reasons I still play the game! Graphics are cool. 10/10Sounds / Voice Acting - Perfect voice acting. Catalina's phone calls mid-game that mock you, car sounds, gun sounds, helicopter sounds, plane sounds, the radio! You even get to have your own radio with your own music. Love it. 10/10Controls - Takes a while to get used to, especially the lowrider ""jumping"" controls. Apparently it was the numpad, and not the arrow keys. 9/10Overall - 10/10""What? No ""All you had to do was follow the damn train, CJ!"" comments?""No, honestly, I found that mission easy and did it in one go. I don't really see the difficulty in it.""I'll have two number 9's, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, number 7, two number 45's, one with cheese, and a large soda.""Wanna guess who said that?When you finish the story, play this song and drive around San Andreas

Grand Theft Auto: San AndreasOpen-World Action-/Racing-Game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games on the 26th October 2004 for Sony Playstation 2,and on the 7th June 2005 for Microsoft Windows and XBOX.Story:The Story is set in the State of San Andreas,which is based on Areas of California and Nevada,with the three major cities Los Santos(Los Angeles),San Fierro(San Francisco) and Las Venturas(Las Vegas).The Main Character,the African-American Carl 'CJ' Johnson,returns to his old hometown Los Santos after five years of living in the fictional city Liberty City(A city that also appears in several other parts of Grand Theft Auto,such as GTA 3,GTA Vice City,where it only gets mentioned by the main character Tommy Vercetti, and GTA 4). After an Introduction Sequence CJ gets to meet several old contacts such as his older brother Sean ""Sweet"" Johnson,his sister Kendl Johnson,and his old gang mates Ryder and Big Smoke. Several plot twists bring CJ to the cities San Fierro and Las Venturas,where he does Missions for several old and new contacts.Gameplay:The player starts with getting dropped off in a district of Los Santos.In the beginning the Player has to do a few Missions first to unlock all the World's content such as clothing shops,hairdresser's,tattoo and gun stores,restaurants and tuning garages. After unlocking the whole content the player is able to find the mentioned features all around the map.With playing the Story missions,the player starts to unlock more of the map,such as the countryside around the cities as well as the cities San Fierro and Las Venturas themselve.The player can travel through the world of San Andreas by using cars,bikes,motorbikes,boats and later even helicopters and planes.For fighting,the game offers a big amount of guns and other weapons that can be found all over the map or bought at one of the several gun stores.The game also includes several minigames such as races,lowrider competitions and dance contests.Atmosphere:The Game's World attracts the player with a realistic,plausible setting and map.Eleven Radio Stations can be heard while riding a vehicle,also players can do their own radio by dragging mp3-files into the user files.Conclusion,Pro's and Con's:Pro:- Funny and addicting gameplay- Huge,beautiful and interesting map- Cool characters- Interesting story about betrayal, family and the Drug War between Gangs- Huge amount of weaponsContra:- Sometimes weird and unplausible moments in story- Car and motorbike stearing got much worse than in the prequels- Irritating MinigamesConclusion:Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a funny,addicting Game which has a huge amount of content and is absolutely worth buying. Although it sometimes has it weak moments,most of the time it is awesome to play!Rating: 90/100Important!The stearing of cars,motorbikes,etc. gets better the longer you drive em'(driving skills improve with time spent riding the different types of vehicles),but without cheats it takes a while to get 'pro' on driving a car!

												A great crime game, worth every penny.Depsite having outdated graphics and an options menu with an anti-aliasing option that you can't activate this game is great fun. I picked it up cheap in the summer sale and I'm glad I did as it's so much fun. I used to think GTA IV was amazing but playing this has made me realise that GTA IV is only a GTA game by a thread. This is the proper crime simulation while GTA IV is more of a casual game this is more realistic (not physics wise but simulation wise).If you can't run or afford GTA V, I would recommend this. I hear they're very similar, and this will satisfy your GTA needs (hopefully). Also don't forget to try out the multiplayer mod that was made for this game, it's great fun!Good game, worth a purchase!9/10P.S. Notice my low playtime. In reality I have been playing SAMP (San Andreas Multiplayer) for a LOT more time than what is displayed here. Sadly Steam doesn't track Non-Steam games and executables (Maybe one day...).			"

4.5 out of 5I've never finished this game, but damn have I wanted to.This game is probably the longest base game I've never actually finished. Granted, I probably would have finished it if my laptop hadn't crashed, therefore destroying all my game, and making me have to restart from the beginning again. But I'm actually glad that happened. Because this game is so damn good it deserves two playthroughs, hell it probably deserves five. It's definitely the long cherished gem of the GTA series for a reason, whilst the much heralded GTA IV might beat it on gameplay depth, GTA: San Andreas sure as hell beats it on everything else.

												I have held back on writing a review about this but I shall be silent no more!Note that this is a review or the CURRENT steam version of the game .All right R* you effed up , and you effed up hard. Here I was , thinking that the whole idea of patches was to make a game better. Instead what do we get? Lower resolutions , black screen freezes and dubious controller support. Wow , thanks I guess, I'll just mod it for 1080p and to use analog triggers for gas/brake on my 360 controller. What is that R*? I cant? Your brilliant state of the art update made all the mods incompatible? Well at least I still have the great soundtrack. What? I dont have that either? You have removed some of the best songs because you were too stingy to pay royalties? IRONY ALERT:CJ actually sings fragments of some of the removed songs when left idle  (""You dropped a bomb on me"" for instance )R* advertise the PC version of GTA 5 having 160 songs more than the console version and at the same time they remove songs from the other game set in the same city.Personal note:I bought this game in hopes of reliving my adolescent years but I guess that was too much to ask for.  I have been now stuck on Fender Ketchup  , the scare-o-meter fills up but nothing happens. That is if the mission starts at all , most of the time the game just freezes when walking into the mission blip or the casino.TL;DR: Not modable, less songs , glitches and freezes.  Dont buy this crap , in this state this is like a beta version of the game we used to know and love. We are paying the same amount of money for less content , which hardly seems fair.			"

												NOTE: I'm reviewing this game while using a (legal) downgrader to 1.0. This changes from the steam version (which sucks) to the good, old one. The first version, that was on hardcopies, etc. The game as it is (without a downgrader) is a ruined game which deleted 18 of great songs and many other content YOU PAID FOR. If it wasn't for the downgrader i'd not recommend it. Now, to the review.Old, but gold. Simply the best.You all know of this game, if not, you were born too early. It's one of the BEST open world games EVER. The story is great, map is huge, there is MYTHS and LEGENDS and EASTER EGGS everywhere. The mod community is the BIGGEST in the world. Songs are GREAT. The whole soundtrack is perfect. There is an unofficial multiplayer mod ""San Andreas: Multi Player"" which is better than GTA Online. I just wanna confirm this game is great. If you didn't hear of it before (which would mean you're kinda left out a bit) just try it. 10/10.			"

												""Black Guy Simulator 2005"" is an accurate depiction of what it truly means to be a descendant of Africa. You start the game performing an ancient ritual of African American culture: performing the theft of the two-wheeled strength-dependent vehicle (Stealing a bike), and as the game progresses, you will be able to perform other activities that are common with colored folk such as eating fried chicken, playing basketball, and engaging in gang warfare.5 ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS FOLLOW THE DAMN TRAIN, CJ's out of 5			"

												i'm writing this review as being a non-GTA fan that was playing GTA SA as his first intorduction to the seriesit is said that good games are games that are infinite or take a long time to beat , grand theft auto is a good example , because it takes an average of 80 hours to beat the game , meanwhile , once beating it  , you'll conclude that you have completed only like half of the game , which means that you still have more secrets and stuff to do .for an old game , GTA san andreas is a good sandbox game , it includes some nice soundtracks , and has a nice long story. you have your weapons , your vehicules , your fellas .....your city that you can freely control (not freely 100% which is sad kinda :p ) .if you ever feel alone , you can tweak the game to make it let you play the multiplayer mode which is actif massivly.10/10 "

												""One of the greatest games ever made.""That's what I said about Vice City and that's also what I think about San Andreas.The game is set in the nineties in a fictional state called San Andreas. You play the role of Carl Johnson (CJ), who has been living in Liberty City. But then he got a phone call. His mom was killed by a drive-by. He rushes home to Los Santos to do honour to his mother. Back at home he has to put in work for his hood. A cycle of violence begins: drugs, gang wars, corrupt police... Welcome to Los Santos!What GTA San Andreas delivers is classical GTA gameplay with many improvments:- the huge world with 3 different cities, smaller towns and varying environments like desert, farmland, forests, hills- an amazing shooting and movment system compared to Vice City   You can duck, swim, dive, climb on rooftops etc. Which gives you a new feeling of freedom- there is even a bigger variety of vehicles: bikes, bicycles, sport cars, SUVs, pick-ups, boats, helicopters and planes!- customisation: tattoos, clothes, hairstyle, tuning cars- RPG elements: you have to eat, you can level up skills - many details and mini-games: robbery, basketball, video games, billard etc.- amazing music: especially rap music (nwa, 2pac, ice cube, eazy-e), but probably not as good as Vice City's musicThe story of GTA SA is okay, but sometimes confusing and hard to follow. I also think that parts of it are a bit over the top. However Rockstar Games did a good job connecting the story of Vice City, San Andreas and GTA 3. They also did a good job with the characters.Some of the missions are a bit annoying, but overall the missions are very good. I really like the addition of stealth in some of the missions.Rockstar added a lot of details and mini-games, which often made me wonder: ""Wtf? You can really break into a house and steal TVs? This game is amazing!"" I love such moments.What I also really liked was the hood part of the game. Getting green shirt, rag and shoes, spray a car in green, call your homies to join you, drive through other gang areas, provoke a gang war... even if the KI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and could have been improved. Of course it's a matter of taste and actually not the whole game is about the hood life.Conclusion: GTA San Andreas offers so much content, that everyone will get countless hours of fun out of it. If you haven't played it yet, go get it now or you'll miss a part of video game history!			"

 ""All we had to do, was follow the damn train, CJ!"" ~ Melvin ""Big Smoke"" Harris Back when I was a little snort other kids were afraid of me because I've been setting dogs on fire. I had only one friend. That friend introduced me to the world of GTA. My first GTA was Vice City. That game was a true experience. It made me feel all tingly in the places I now pay women to lick and suck. Results, unfortunately, cannot be compared to the pleasure Vice City gave me. And then my only friend said:  ""♥♥♥♥♥, negro, wait till you play San Andreas.""   MY ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GOD  That game wasn't like anything I played before. It was bigger, faster, better. It had everything my developing body and mind needed. Rockstar had always been great with writing plot and making cutscenes but they outdone themselves in San Andreas. It had it all. Gang wars, bouncing lowriders, classic rock, sunset over the desert, robbing the casino, murdering harlots to get your cash back, etc, etc.I mean, you started as a low gangbanger from the ghetto with no rep, no name and then BAM you're stealing a fighter jet from an air carrier just to blow Russian spies to kingdom come. Is there anything better? Of course not, you ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥.I've been playing it with my mouth open and my underwear leaking with j1zz. From blastin dem balla fools through exile from Los Santos, passing  THOSE MOTHERFUKING DRIVING AND FLYING SCHOOLS,  stealing a jetpack, all the way to blastin balla fools again that game was just... just... it was... DAYUM SON IT WAS THE ♥♥♥♥♥, NIQQA, IT WAS THE ♥♥♥♥♥.I played that game not long ago and I know whatchu sayin,  ""Ah but shiee, dawg, dat game is hella old and it looks terrible and check muh CS:GO skins, shieee.""  If you do that and please follow Robin Williams' example and ♥♥♥♥♥ KILL YOURSELF. This game has flaws, yes, but it is, even today, one of the greatest achievements of game industry.Such names as CJ, Sweet, Cesar, Kendl, The Truth, Toreno,  motherfukin Tenpenny  are part of my life. They will stay with me forever. That game shaped me. Made me a better man.Final Rating: ★★★★★ That's right, beyotch. 5 motherfukin stars. That game means more to me than my mother.			"

												I loved this game when i played it on the ps2 and i was looking foward to playing on pc to get my childhood memories back but after playing not even an hour i cant recommend this game.Rockstar Updated the game for no reasons... have you ever heard the term leave well enough alone? well we all know rockstar did not hear that because with the update nearly a decade later. The updated removed songs form the radio station people report about broken save files and they even removed resolutions... i play on a 1366x768 and they dont even have that resolution... i think they have four or five resoltions you can choose from and if you have a higher resolutions that what gta sa gives you then to bad you have to play on one of the lower resolutions.Also my game freezed up by trying to enter the pizza shop close to grove street! What i never had a game freeze up on me and i have played arma 2 and 3 farcry 4 assassins creed 4 and many more and i can play them just fine but i cant play a 10 year old game without it freezing? Also people have reported that you cant mod gta sa no more... why the **** not rockstar, you took away SA MP why would you do that to us. One of the most popular if not the most popular gaming company gave us the worst update they could have ever done. you should put gta sa on the steam workshop that would be amazing but you wont will you rockstar... no you wont, you took away many of our childhood memories with that update, you need to reupdate the game taking away all the stuff you put in this update.I have also noticed that the textures in the game are messed up as well, at the begining of the game when officer tenpenny and the other 2 officers gun down carl i noticed there guns clipping through the hands and it was very noticable so yes it is true that there is glitches with the textures in the game.Another issue is that when i start up the game i cant use the mouse i have to CTRL+ALT+DEL many times to get my mouse to move the camera which makes no sense... and yes you can use a controller but you dont know what to do because it say stuff like use joy 9 to do this or joy 11 to do this... why not just say use y to enter and car and use x to jump... so unless you know all the 16 buttons and where they are at on the controller you wont be able to play with a controller. and yes i know you might be thinking that well if you have played gta sa before you should be able to play with a controller right... wrong because when i tried to use the controller everything was swapped around on the controller making it impossible to figure out what was what and where was where.So i wish i could recommend this game but no i cant i feel it would be a sin to recommend this game that was one a amazing game to now a run down game full of missing songs to broken save files to texture glitches... and its sad knowing one of the very best gta games has been ruined by there own creator's... i never thought the day would come.

It seem like I'm on impossible missions twisted predicaments hostile positions. Tenpenny and Pulaski harass me cop cars been on our ♥♥♥ the last past week. Because the Dreas for the gangsters homeboy hands is the language for the bangers homeboy. And its dangerous homeboy get your brains blow for how you do your fingers homeboy. Heat cocked we popping them hot one's dump them out bend the block shaken before the cops come listen for sirens but they don't got none back another lap catch a stragler with a shotgun.

												Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas boasts an exceptional soundtrack, a well-written story line and a slew of plot twists and other surprises. The dialogue between CJ and his crew is raw but convincing, and some big-name celebrities contribute their vocal talent, including James Woods and George Clinton.Without question, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas isn't for kids because of its graphic violence, sex, and coarse language, but mature fans of this 32 million-unit-selling franchise who want to know if this sequel lives up to its hype, the answer is a resounding yes. Few video games pull off everything successfully, but San Andreas does so in spades. Indeed, this mature-rated game may be deemed offensive for its depiction of life as a ""gangbanger,"" but if taken for what it is -- an interactive action-adventure for adult gamers -- you won't find a title that's more difficult to put down.

												I always played this game on PS2 but I love the PC controls a lot more. Look, do not play this game on PS2 anymore because the graphics and lighting compared to this pc port are so damn washed out, I just can't believe it. This game is a classic and if you want a good written story with good voice acting than, you would like this as well. The only bad side to this game is the default controls. They are just terrible and hard to get used to. Totally change the controls as fast as you can. It's kind of disappointing that most people won't go out and get a 10 year old and just buy the newest GTA, but you don't know what you're missing out on. Graphics might be really dated but the story will never be. If you're a retro kind of guy like me, then you should reconsider your next buy.			"

												Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is what I consider the best of the series. I am constantly surprised Rockstar managed to put this game on the PS2. It features a massive open world, with a simply sublime soundtrack and cast of characters. The gameplay was far more dynamic then it's predecessor. With being able to climb walls, to having a parachute, to finding a jetpack and doing drive by shootings from 50 feet in the air.San Andreas was just as amazing when it first came out as it is today. Almost every modern sandbox game takes leaps and bounds that Rockstar first carved in 2004. If you only buy one Grand Theft Auto game, buy this one.

												Since Rockstar simply has removed a lot of content and stopped fixing this game it's completely clear that this game is abandoned and that we who own the ""game"" are left with the computer version of Pripyat, Chernobyl and a 9,99 euro big hole in our wallets, this game is abandoned by rockstar (wich is a shame) and is full of crashes and removed content, until rockstar has fixed the problems (wich I don't think they will do) do not buy this game.

Then I pirated it to see for myself, what's that GTA game is. And I swear to my grandma's life, I know San Andreas better than the city I live since my birth (and this will be over 21 years now). Sure, R* totally ruined Steam version with its license-bullsh♥t patches, but GTA modding community is one of strongest and didn't give up and let GTA:SA hurt too much.

ENGLISH and Italian Review Recensione Inglese ed ITALIANA English:You haven't really played GTA until you played San Andreas. It's one of the best titles in the series, IF not the best. There isn't that much to say, engaging story, great gameplay, politically incorrect american humor, and lots, lots of violence. With a result of lots and lots of fun. GTA San Andreas ladies and gentlemen, a milestone. We don't need to say anything else (Sorry for my bad english)Italiano:Non hai veramente giocato a GTA finché non hai giocato a San Andreas. E' uno dei titoli migliori della serie, se non IL migliore sotto certi aspetti. C'è poco da dire, storia avvincente, gameplay ottimo, umorismo americano politicamente scorretto e tanta, tanta violenza. Con un risultato di tanto, tanto divertimento.

												CJ returns to Los Santos after spending five years living in Liberty City when his brother Sweet calls to inform him of their mother's murder. Shortly after leaving the airport, CJ is intercepted by a group of corrupt officers from the Los Santos Police Department (LSPD) Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums (CRASH) division led by Frank Tenpenny, and followed by Officers Eddie Pulaski and Jimmy Hernandez, with whom CJ has a history. Tenpenny implicates CJ in the murder of a police officer named Pendlebury, that Tenpenny himself committed, as he was on the verge of exposing him to Internal Affairs, and threatens to frame him for it if he does not co-operate with them. CJ returns to his former home on Grove Street and reunites with his brother Sweet, sister Kendl and members of his old gang, Big Smoke and Ryder. Finding that the Grove Street Families (GSF) have lost much of their territory while he was gone, CJ decides to stay in town. Working with the others to re-establish the GSF, CJ gradually restores the gang to power, allying himself with Kendl's boyfriend, Cesar Vialpando, leader of the Varrios Los Aztecas, and together they drive off the rival Ballas and Vagos gangs, reducing the amount of drugs on the streets. In doing so, CJ regains the respect of Sweet, who was disappointed that he had left Grove Street after the death of their brother, Brian. While en route to join Sweet for a showdown against the Ballas, CJ is called by Cesar, who tells him to meet with him outside a garage where they witness Smoke and Ryder meeting with Tenpenny and a group of Ballas, learning that they had been working with Tenpenny all along, and were responsible for his mother's murder. Suspecting a set-up, CJ rushes to Sweet's aid, who was wounded in the ambush, and fights off the Ballas, but the police arrive shortly afterward. Sweet is imprisoned while Tenpenny takes CJ into the countryside and dumps him there. With the GSF in shambles, Smoke and Ryder, now openly allied with the Ballas.			"

												GTA: San Andreas.. A game that opened up a lot of enjoyable and memorable moments. I remember being by the coast and a blonde woman in roller skates flying past me saying ""I'm so thick that I can ♥♥♥♥"", I cried away at this for quite a while and never forgot it. This game exposed what was supposed to be the life of a drug dealer and the struggles that came for Carl Johnson. Playing this on the PS2 was great simply because I would have one of my friends play with me, the coop was a great idea which I loved after playing this alone which would get pretty boring. The missions were very fun and exciting; moments of rage were present very frequently when I failed.			"

												Well Rockstar, you've just ruined one of my most favourite games, a childhood game. Well done you ♥♥♥♥♥♥. To add huge insult to the injury, you're not even responding to the gargantuan complaints of your consumers. Yes, I know the notion of modding content back in has been put forward, and thanks to all who have suggested that but the point is that this shouldn't even be happening in the first place. True, it will cost a lot to get back the licenses and restore the old version, but ask yourselves R*, what is your community (the people who buy your games) worth to you?			"

												All this time, years and years after being released onto this world, San Andreas has remained one of the best GTA games ever to be made. Compared to the present ones, yeah, it lacks graphics, that's the only flaw it really has.   So, you are a black man - Not being racist here - And your life is just... awful, care to make it better? This game is all about it, making someone's life better. You start has a lowlife gangbanging balla killing machine.. and at the end? The exact same thing, but rich, the whole city is at your feet.  In my opinion, this game makes me feel great, riding bikes on the desert at extremely high speeds, jumping off a plane without a parachute, hearing Cj's remarkable comments everytime.. pure comedy. Besides, having a mature and dark story, if you are willing to hear it, the surreal experience makes you feel part of it.   This game is old, hell yeah it is, but so is your mom.. and you still love her don't you? That's what i fell, it has everything GTA V has, except great graphics and online gameplay. You can steal houses here, buy ridiculously expensive massions, make great cars (Racing Ones), participate in lowrider events, races... or even, just parking your car somewhere, doesn't matter where really, and listen to the music this game has.. (+ adding your own to the game) At the end of the day, to me, this game beats GTA V - 100/0- No doubts. Wanna know why? Groove is Life ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"

												Phenomenal open-world sandbox. Great gameplay with a variety of missions and things to do, an excellent story that knows when to be serious and when to be funny, and a phenomenal radio setlist that really captures the feel of the early '90s. However, you're better off pirating it or playing it on a PS2 emulator because of the patch Rockstar put in that removed a bunch of songs from the in-game radio (they took out Killing in the Name and Hellraiser, would not buy), removed resolution options, and broke everybody's saves. Or you could just buy it on steam and download the unofficial patch that fixes the the game and the stuff Rockstar removed, but that would mean giving them money.			"

Well, it is exactly what Rockstar and Steam did with this game, with their patch from November 2014 they totally ruined my experience with this game:- full HD resolution(1920 x 1080) was removed [edit: this was fixed meanwhile]- somehow parts of the gfx must have been removed, overally it looks much more dull now- mouse/eyboard controls are totally messed up [edit: with a little work, the original controls can be restored]- parts of the soundtrack were removed, many songs are just gone nowI will not buy any game from Rockstar anymore, including GTA V, until this has been fixed.I will think twice before buying any game from Steam again, as long games I buy here can be reduced into an unplayable mess later!

												Given the wonderful environment design, new RPG elements, and extremely well done ""gangsta"" theme, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas comes as close to perfect as anything could.Sure, the instant replay feature was left out, but this is a mostly untouched Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, one of the best games ever made, and now a version of it can be played on the PC with the best controls and graphics available.The soundtrack is inspired, with a heavy emphasis on late-'8s/early '90s rap and alternative rock. What does make it great is that it actually delivers on nearly everything it promises while still being fun to just pick up and play.			"

												Even if the Grand Theft Auto series has always been good, this was one of the best games in the series. In many people's opinion it was better than GTA IV. Although it wasn't perfect, the sheer size of San Andreas was something that could not be denied. It had country sides and even the city of Los Santos. This was R* (Rockstar's) best game until GTA V. Even thought GTA: SA is old I still enjoy playing it and it's still  great game. The story is great and the open-world is fun too. I highly recommend it.(it's better than minecraft)			"

												I thought i would never give a game a 10/10. I was wrong.Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a game that separates itself from all others. San Andreas' combination of a great story, great game play and much more is why.Story - 10/10I think the story is very good. You are Carl Johnson. You are coming back from Liberty City because you got a call from your brother Sweet saying your mother just died. All this crazy stuff happens. Its great and really sucks you in. You will want more when you finish the game.Graphics - 8/10The graphics are average at best, but the animations are great. The rest of the game makes up for the graphics.Sound - 10/10The sound in the game is phenomenal. There are many radio stations with a huge variety of music. You can even have a custom radio station with your own tracks! The sound affects are perfect. The voice acting is even BETTER than perfect! Young Maylay completely nails his voice acting role of Carl Johnson (The main character in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas).Controls - 9.6/10The controls are great. It can be confusing at first, but you will get used to them very quickly. If you are used to playing the PS2 version of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, you can buy a PS2 to PC converter so you can use the PS2 controller with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas for the PC. Game play - 10/10Wow. Simply wow. Playing this game is so much fun. I just can't get enough of San Andreas. I still play it today. You will be playing it forever. There is so much to do. You can do missions, destroy crap, dating a girl friend and MUCH, MUCH, MUCH more! I am so amazed at how much fun this game is!Bonus Features/Mods - 10/10After you beat Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, you will still be playing for months, maybe even years like me! You can download mods like a Bigfoot mod, car mods, and all kinds of mods! You can do anything you want after you finish the game. My favorite thing to do after beating the game is searching for Easter eggs and myths. San Andreas is full of them!Final Score - 10/10Simply put. This is the greatest game ever made. Props to Rock Star for making such a amazing game! BUY THIS GAME NOW!			"

												I am playing the GTA serie one after the other.Finished GTA III and Vice City. (see my reviews)What's different / new compared to Vice City (VC)Same like VC1) Overview map : Can be accessed via the game menu, in addition to VC you can add a marker.Still the lack of a hotkey 'M' for direct map access.....because it is a console port.2) Cash income : slow so you are 'forced' to do side missions. Later in the game, you haveaccess to race missions and can export cars at the harbor which are really helpfull in cash generation.3) Buying properties and as such having a save point or an asset (cash generation)4) Weaponry : +/- same, in addition knife or silenced pistol for stealth.5) Music score : Same quality which means superb, choice for everyone....rock, hip-hop, rap, alternative, country.6) pop-ups of cars and buildings even at high drawing distance settings7) frame limiter needs to be set 'on' just like VC and GTAIII to avoid strange physics of cars.Better then VC1) Windows 10 : Unlike VC and GTA III, i didn't need to apply the Silent patch to run the game smoothly.2) Map size : hughhhh, three cities connected with green land, mountains and local villages.Each city has it's own typical lay-out with references to Las Vegas - San Francisco - Los Angeles3) New vehicles : bike, truck, train, tractor, harvester, buggy, go-cart4) Besides the story line missions, there are plenty of side missions. The classic ones like ambulance driving, be a fire fighter, playing the cop and chase criminals, find hidden collectibles, do unique stunt jumps, start illegal races but also newones like driving a truck, going back to school (bike - plane - car - boat), playing the burglar, driving a freight train, dance with the low rider car, ......5) Graphics, it is not a major jump forward but people can walk (no zombie walk), Anti-liasing can be turned on and there are blur effects to mimic hot weather or fast speed during racing.6) Like barbie or Ken, you can 'modify' CJ with tattoos, shoes, trousers, hair style for improvinghis sex appeal and attract women's attention.7) If you train or just by playing, you will get better in shooting, driving, fighting, swimming etc.8) In-game references to previous games like pictures of Candy SUxxx and Love Fist, the appearance of characters of GTAIII and Vice City which is fun. Certainly the Britisch lads.9) Police and passengers are more agressive.10) In VC and GTAIII, water is deadly, in SA you can swim and dive.11) No screen loadingsLess then VC1) Story line : somehow pointless, neccessary to make connections between missions but that's it, VC is simply better.2) Main character CJ : Errand boy.... dull character compared to Antonio Vercetti (VC)3) NPC's : some SA-characters are nerve cracking and very childish -> Catalina, The Truth and OG Loc4) Humour (characters and radio stations): less refined.5) Flying a plane (not heli) with mouse and keyboard is horrible. For finishing the main game, one needs to finish the flight school and that is really painfull and frustating.Overall it is a good game don't get me wrong but it has it's flaws.The proper balance between quantity versus quaility.Vice City is smaller (David vs Golliath) and offers less play time, but beats San Andreas when it comes to story, characters and humour.Now, it is time to move on to GTA 4 (which has it's installation issues)			"

												Game itself is great, don't get me wrong on that. The reason why I'm not recommending this is because the PC port is dreadful. The mouse is automatically inverted(not a problem really, just an opinion), other than that I get about 20 FPS average with V-sync on with my GTX 760, I get better performance on watch_dogs with V-sync on. The part that really gets me about the PC port is when you change some of the mouse settings, the mouse automatically freezes when you're in-game so you can't look around until you reset the settings to default. The mouse sensitivity is horrible, even with the lowest mouse sensitivity possible and turning my gaming mouse down to the lowest DPI possible it was still very sensitive. Really wanted to enjoy this game but the PC port isn't all that good.			"

												Back when the game first came out for PlayStation 2 I quickly fell in love with it, it felt so revolutionary.. the amount of freedom and the variety of content completely blew my teenage mind. I remember waking up early in the morning booting up my console and spend entire weekends alone and with friends, just messing around, using cheats, and myth hunting on the local multiplayer.So a few years later when I first bought a computer, I re-purchased this game to reminisce the good old days, that was when I discovered modding for the very first time, I remember spending countless hours a day just fiddling with the game files, so it felt like a completely new experience every time I played. Ever since then, I've beat the storyline a total of 22 times on both platforms, and I've been playing this game for almost 10 years now... I don't think I will ever experience something like this in my lifetime ever again.This game will forever be remembered by me as the pinnacle of the Grand Theft Auto franchise.(Re-write pending) "

												Do not buy. 0/10After latest patch, (Which seems to me it ruined PC version because Microsoft own San Andreas and since Xbox has the 10 Year update it has ruined it for everything else.)If you have already bought it, Download a lower patch (v1 or v1.01 - V1.01 is a little better as it contains some bug fixes whilst maintaing the main files for modding in v1)Im not sure if anyone else has this issue, but the game now forever keeps crashing, if either its 5 mins or 1 hour. it'll crash. Some indoor locations also crash. (So please note this could be an issue for you)If you still want San Andreas, Pick up a PS2, Xbox, or the ORIGINAL PC disc retail version.			"

												You start as CJ, a black male who is coming back to the hood to defeat rival gangs and doing missions for your homies. You are able to drive bikes, vehicles, boats, planes, etc. You can collect many things to unlock secrets. A lot of missions that needs to be solved, even sidequests like car races, etc. With many mods from the internet you can modifier this game to the maximum. It seems like you can play San Andreas on Multiplayer Mode, i saw a guide on steam about this feature, but im not sure if it's working. But even without the feature, there is a lot to do or things to have fun with. Why u should buy it:-The main characters are talking like gangsters and insulting each other, very cool atmosphere (not like GTA3 were Claude isn't speaking a single word). -You are able to swim and climb over lower walls.-You can do sidequests missions like police, medic or firefighter which rewards you with secrets.-Many things to collect, like 100x graffiti tags, 50x horseshoes, 50x oysters, 50x snapshots.-Rival Gang Territorial Fights, defending or conquering rival gang territorials.-You are able to buy houses/properties so you are having more savegame houses or garages for your vehicles.-Monster Stuns or burglary missions.-You can dress your character individual with new clothes or accessiores, you even get new haircuts.-Tuning your car with new spoilers or body kits and fill it with nitro/nos so you can drive like a boss through San Andreas.-Many things more i just forgot... ;)This game is a must have buy, it's still the best GTA game in my Opinion.

												OK. I'm supposed to write a review for the game that I've been playing for more than 23 hours but loaded page directed me to somewhere else. Speaking for playing hours, 0.1 is for Windows version and the other one is for Mac version. There's no any difference between the two except for the platform which the two are based respectively.In spite of being presented prior to this decade it's still a really a good game, featuring the second largest payable area in the whole series. Main storyline and side missions are challenging, interesting, and durable. One can simply stick to it for months, just like my little brother and young me did.There are bunches of cheating codes there. I'd like to recommend them if you are gonna explore more trivia of this game, but it doesn't apply to missions. Completing whole missions without using any cheats might be hard but it's a good way to enjoy the story itself. Don't worry about money accordingly. You will earn a lot through missions and your properties would ensure you are an upcoming millionaire of the State and San Andreas.Enjoy it!			"

												""All you had to do was follow the damn train CJ!""It may seem like a relic from when games were less cushioned. There were no autosave features, no HD textures, and no friends asking to go play darts. Nevertheless, GTA San Andreas is still a stellar example of wonderful and varied world design, and it's attention to detail rivals that of many modern open-world games. This game will provided nearly limitless hours of fun and ridiculous freeroaming, with a decent story to back it up. GTA San Andreas is well worth a pricetag of $60.00, let alone $15.00.			"

												One of my biggest pet peeves is when people complain about how hard the mission 'wrong side of the tracks' is. There is a reason why it's one of the first missions in the game people, just keep up with the train, don't crash the bike and you will beat it. JUST FOLLOW THE TRAIN CJ. Thats my little rant aside, this is hands down the best GTA of all time in my opinion. Just the size of the world and the variety of missions alone make it the best. Missions like you driving a bike into a plane before it takes off, blowing up the plane and then jumping out with a parachute. Stealing a plane, jumping out the plane into another plane, killing everyone in the plane then flying that plane back to the airport.Sneaking into a military base, killing everyone there once you're inside, stealing a jetpack and escaping the base by flying out of there using the jetpack while choopers and planes are on your a*s trying to shoot you down. The casino robbery and the final mission, there are so many others like that i could go on forever. It also has the best story in the series in my opinion as well as the best characters like big smoke, ryder, catalina, mike toreno, tenpenny, woozie etc. And the length of the game as well and all the side missions and activities is crazy even though i can beat the game fairly quickly now because i played through it so many times. A first time playthrough will take you around 30 hours. I also have to mention the amazing soundtrack and radio stations its great stuff. This is more of a love letter then a review, its one of my favourite games of all time.10/10 (Masterpiece)			"

												Nope, nope nope nopety nope, do NOT get this game on Steam. GTA San Andreas is one of the greatest videogames in history, however the Steam version is garbage.Pros: Do I really need to talk about how great this game is? If you're not familiar with this game, then you probably don't know that much about videogames.Cons:1- It crashes too much, and the mouse usually stops functioning with the game.2- The Steam version is mod-proof, meaning that if you attempted to install a mod, the game would crash and you might need to reinstall the game.3- It doesn't function with controllers, though I'm not sure if that's a problem with the Steam version or all versions of the game.If you want my advice: Get V1 of GTA San Andreas on the PC, or get it on a PlayStation or an Xbox console. If you can manage to overlook the cons of this version, then there's no problem with getting it here.			"

												The game itself isn't bad. It's my favorite gta game. But, i'm can't recomend this steam version to anyone. It's been absolutely butchered. I've only been able to play it about 5 times, 4 times when i first bought it, when suddenly it stopped working and wouldn't launch. I tried everything. Then, after the update deleted my save files i was able to play it again for a few minutes. Today it it refused to launch again. Besides all that, a lot of songs from the original game have been removed and the controls are a bit difficult. I haven't even been able to play the game long enough to tell you what's wrong with it because it simply doesn't work. 6/10 if you can get it to work,Save yourself the pain and either download it elsewhere or snag a ps2 and a physical copy of the game.Update: After the patch i was able to play, but lost my save files and had to start all over. It works okay. I still wouldn't recoment buying it.			"

												This game WAS amazing. My first thought was i thought that removing the music was okay, even though it took the joy out of it, i still bought it. Then when I launched the game, my mouse wont click and the screen wont move when i try to look around.The BUGS are so annoying as hell and I'm raging because I wanted to play this again. I can forgive you removing the songs but please fix the bugs. Good thing I bought this on sale.			"

												Hmm, depends what you mean by ""reccomend,"" as to what my answer would be.Firstly, I got this as a free D/L with GTA V (pre-order) so, it was free. However, I had the non-steam (retail disk) version a few years back, so thought it would be fun to relive the old days, before GTA V came out. The game is crappy now. It is poorly optimised, most of the songs I remember are gone, and the resolution is very low, even on its highest settings. I thought this was perculiar, as the resolution was great, when I first got the game in 2010/2011. Having done some research, I found out that R* patched the game, to the point where it was essentially a port of the MOBILE game. This dissapointed me greatly. In conclusion, no, I don't reccomend this. If you got it free with GTA V, its okay, because it's free. However, don't buy this on it's own.Really, my honest opinion is, if you want to play this game, torrent it. This gives you the genuine experience of what the game was intended to be upon release. However, if you don't want to break the law, GTA V is my answer.			"

												Ok. This game is absolutely amazing in every way possible. I just wanted to get this out of the way right here:Here are the specs of my PC:Processor: Intel Pentium CPU: B980 @ 2.40GHz RAM: 4GB Operating System: Windows 10 Type: 64-bit operating system x64-based processor Graphics Card: Intel HD GraphicsAnd guess what? I'm getting over 100FPS! This game is well optimized, and has a great story. There is so much you can do on the PC version that you can't do on the PS2/XB versions. Amazing mod support, great story, great gameplay, and good graphics and frame rate for a terrible PC like mine! Even though I'm running the game at low graphics, you can't even tell a difference.The game's story is very long, but it's so open-world, that it feels like San Andreas is just as big as the GTA V version of Los Santos. I also noticed that this game along with a couple other GTA games has gore in it, which makes it a little more graphic. I'm totally ok with it too, just thought I'd bring it up.The gameplay mechanics are a little different than the PS2/XB versions of the game. There's no auto aim on PC (unless if you play with the controller mod), but PC gaming is really advanced and I understand why they don't have auto aim for mice. It'll be really easy to get a shot with auto aim if your playing on PC. I also know that the PC version is missing a cheat code from the console version, and there are a few changes to the environment, because the console version and the PC version are not exactly the same either. It's alright though.I'll give this a 9/10, and here is my list of PROS and CONS on the PC version:PROS:Great mod supportGreat storyGreat gameplayGreat performance/optimizationOPEN WORLD BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Well, that should go under gameplay)And it actually works on bad PC's!CONS:Missing cheat codeEnviromental changes between PC and consoleSlight gameplay mechanic changesBad controller support (you have to use the controller mod to have good controller support)No intro at the beginning of the game (for me at least, I don't know about other people)Well, this is my review for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas on the PC. I love it, and I'd play it any day.			"

												The game itself isn't bad. It's my favorite gta game. But, i'm can't recomend this steam version to anyone. It's been absolutely butchered. I've only been able to play it about 5 times, 4 times when i first bought it, when suddenly it stopped working and wouldn't launch. I tried everything. Then, after the update deleted my save files i was able to play it again for a few minutes. Today it it refused to launch again. Besides all that, a lot of songs from the original game have been removed and the controls are a bit difficult. I haven't even been able to play the game long enough to tell you what's wrong with it because it simply doesn't work. 6/10 if you can get it to work,Save yourself the pain and either download it elsewhere or snag a ps2 and a physical copy of the game.Update: After the patch i was able to play, but lost my save files and had to start all over. It works okay. I still wouldn't recoment buying it.			"

												My personal favorite of the PS2 Grand Theft Autos - an absolutely massive world, tons of things to do throughout the entire environment, a decent story spanning three entire cities, wonderful music....this game has it all. I can't recommend this game enough.The one mark against it that I would give the PC version is that it does not have any 16:9 screen resolutions by default - you'll have to do some modding yourself in order to get it to work in the appropriate resolution which is extremely disappointing. But aside from that minor technical issue, an absolutely wonderful game, and a must-have for any person looking to build their game collection.			"

												Ahhhh, the classic Grand Theft Auto Series, so many good memories of this game, from younge and old... this game was a staple of the GTA series often said to be the BEST GTA in the whole series. So let me go over the Pros and Cons.Pros:- LONG Story MANY hours will go into this game and most will not be Regretted.- The Game has a HUUUUUUUGE map to explore, and find the oh so many secrets.- The Customization of your character is almost infinite, with so MANY different variaties to choose from you could deck out your character as much as you'd like.-SO many cars to choose from, including Bicycles and and Motorcycles, most cars able to be customized and outfitted.-Your character can learn different fighting styles as he travles, making him versatile in brawls.-You can Swim, HOLY CRAP a Grown man who can swim.-You can recruit grang members into a posse, and do drive bys or have massive gun fights.-You can claim territory and have massive gang wars with the 3 other Opposing gangs.-SO MANY weapons to pick from, including Assualt Rifles, SMGs, Pistols.-Many shop interirors and building interiors to check out and see.-Many Secret Interiors and other Secrets around the world, for you to explore and find.-Its made by Rockstar I mean COME on Rockstar games is BAD ♥♥♥.-Lag is non-exsistant.-Nice Musical pieces on all Radio Stations, and a few Radio Talkshows have some funny dialogue.-The game isn't too easy or too hard, some missions being SUPER easy, while some will be a challenge.Cons:-Graphics are not exactly the best.-Controls on PC can be confusing (Especially for thoese of Us who played it on PS2)-The save feature in this game, is annoying. (You have to drive ALL the way back to a home you own JUST to save.)-The Music and Speech in the game, can often feel repetitive and just plain boring.-Missions have NO checkpoints, so if you die YOU have to do that mission ALL over again.-Modding is hard to do in this game.Would I recommend this game? Yes, I would infact i'd recommend it to anyone whos already played the game, or IS completely new to Rockstar Games, or the GTA franchise. The game is overall one of the few games I play, that don't require mods to BE fun or MORE fun.			"

												As other reviews have stated, I would have recomended this game several weeks ago. I got it on a steam sale for $1.99 and it was one of the best deals I've gotten for such a great game. However ♥♥♥♥♥tar and Steam have literally broken this game. In order to even accept saves from previous versions, a mod must be downloaded (if they weren't deleted when you started the game). They also removed 17 songs from the radio stations. Things such as this prove to be the fly in the ointment of auto-updated games. Sadly, I must agree with the conesnsus: pirate this game or buy a physical copy so that you may enjoy the game as originally intended.			"

												My Opinion About The Game (Without Story Spoilers) : Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas is an Open World TPS made and published by Rockstar Studios . I probaby don't need to intouduce you to the series. I didn't play Vice City (I will and when I did I'll delete this part of the review) and all the others before that but I played all the others after this one. For me it seems like this one has the biggest world that you can actually go to. Like I said I didn' played the other games before this one (yet) but I think this has the best story out of all of them. I like all of them though. The only con I can think of this game considering it's age are the flying tutorials and missions they are awful hard. You can say that I'm a noob but I've seen a lot of people having the same problem. So I recommend playing atleast that part of the game with a controller but overall I recommend a controller for the game because of the vehicles. There's a small negative part of the game which is small because it doesn't  happen if you do this like I say , there's a part of the game where you have to take over territories . And theres a small territory named Jefferson Motel. That territory is so small that enemy gang members doesn't spawn there , so you need to lure them from other territories nearby. But if you took over all the territories except that one you gonna have a hard time capturing it. So I recomend capturing that one first. There are other negatives  which I did a researc on when I noticed the same things which  are regarding the Steam version not the game itself. Rockstar added a patch to the game which removed songs , option for changing resoultions and something with SAMP isn't right either . I played the crack GTA SA with SAMP and it barely had crashes but with the Steam version it crashes at least 1 time in 1 hour but usually around 2-3 times. And they messed up people's saves but that didn't affect me because I got the game after that. I completed the game's story 100%  all the missions all the territories all the stats like Respect , Stamina , Muscle theese kind of things , schools etc. I really like the game's story I like the characters I like that I don't have to go to bowling in every second. If you have Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 and SAMP doesn't start properly run Steam in administrator mode and set both GTA SA and samp exe to run in Windows SP3 (on Windows 8.1) , Windows 98 (on Windows 10)  and both in administrator mode. This made the multiplayer worked even tho you still gonna have crashes because of the crappy port.Graphics : 9 (The game came out in 2005)Audio : 9 (The Steam version itself would be 7 because of the removal of some songs)Gameplay : 10 (If you want to play SAMP on the Steam version you gonna have a hard time and I don't even know about what's up with the modding in it , considering GTA V's status on that)Story : 9 Replayability : 8 (8 because of the hell in the flying missions)Value : 6 (7 If you only buy it for the Single Player )Overall I recommend the game mainly if you only want to play in single player or if you don't mind a lot of crashes then multiplayer too. Well I wouldn't complain much about it after the GTA IV port. Enjoy the game !			"

												This game is an accurate representation of Grandpa's childhood, growing up in the 50's was hard. We didn't have fancy things like watches and roads, we had gravel and pavement and we liked it. There were no black people, because they lived underground and so this game couldn't exist then.I enjoy this game, because it has black people in it, just like my favorite movie Friday. I love when they say ♥♥♥♥♥♥ alot, it reminds me of my father, when I was a kid. Back then dad would take us to what the whites called ""♥♥♥♥♥♥ Races"" it was where a bunch of black gentlemen would be gathered and your great grandpa would bet on which one would win the race. We never won, but boy were those good memories. Anyways, this game gets a 9.5/10 because it reminds Grandpa of the early days of black rights and privelleges. (Note: Grandpa is very old and of a different time, if you are of african american descent please don't take offense ~ Billy) "

												In October San Andreas became 10 years old. I replayed it because of nostalgia and I was shockingly surprised to see that a big part of its soundtrack was removed (18 songs = 11% of the total number of songs if my information is correct). And I felt it while progressing through the game. Towards the end I was flipping radio channels to get a song I haven't heard that much and it was becoming increasingly difficult to do so.Even though I enjoyed it, I can't recommend it. Not like this. This recent patch which did more damage than improvements (the game crashed a few times for me but usually it ran ok). If you want an old school GTA game, get Vice City. It has better mission structure and a better world (SA has a bigger world and a better setting for a GTA game but it doesn't use it as well as Vice City did).			"

Songs have been taken out , the game crashes after 10 minute of playing , savegames no longer works with the new version.. Rip-off .. not a real game . I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS ON STEAM!

												Well this final version for the GTA 3rd Generation; RenderWare Engine series appears to be at the limit for more powerful GFX and advanced gameplay. All I can say is maybe avoid using cheats that will ruin your stats as well spoil this game too often. Trust me you best exploring this city game for yourself, without magic.They are some unofficial patches that can enhance this game further to fix those long term abandoned bugs and DirectDraw fixes. This game works best with Frame Rate Limit locked at 30FPS as CJ cannot swim and dive properly when the FPS is not locked at 30.But if you want to risk and improve your adventure with those unofficial patches, use those link downloads at your own risk!http://apg-clan.org/vbdownloads.php?do=download&downloadid=778http://apg-clan.org/vbdownloads.php?do=download&downloadid=779http://apg-clan.org/vbdownloads.php?do=download&downloadid=788 "

												===WARNING SPOILERS BELOW DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT THE PLOT TO BE SPOILED===Grand Thegt Auto is a game developed by ME  at my house in 2006. IT's a flash indie game made with the source engine and it has cross compatability with both lindows and windux. Right off the bat you are thrust into the shoes of Coldsteel the gang banger aka Carl Johntron working for the illuminati fish capers known as CRASH who are corrupt and work to further the secret agenda of single black women everywhere. After a plane crash the preisdent calls in Chill iron to come sell drugs to kids across california so CRASH can operate in secret and save the world from the russian mobsters importing illegal lobsters to suburban housewives in the US. But the game takes a twist when Icemetal the gang banger is thrown in crime for a prison he did not commet. His brother Small Vapor turns out to be working with the russians and you must break out of prison using your streeet knowledge to board a giant airship made of lobsters and kill your brother. Afterwards you are shown a cutscene where your mother turns out to be a lobster and you kill yourself wiht your brothers corpse due to your grief. If you get the bad end then CRASH loses all their funding and the russians ivnade us and the cold war breaks out. There is no good end yet because I haven't got it yet. 7/10			"

												I've had a phyiscal disc of this game for a long time now, and purely for convenience I picked it up on Steam a while ago. However, the recent update essentially stripped content and broke saves. As of this time I recommend pirating the game instead of purchasing it on Steam, because right now you would be paying the same amount for less content than you would have gotten a few months ago. Either that or find a used copy on Ebay. I have tried contacting Rockstar on the issue and of course they haven't replied at all. Rockstar has gone on my list of companies to not buy games from anymore, right next to Ubisoft and EA... so good going with that. Wonder how much content they will remove from GTA IV/V in a few years.			"

												Finished this a while ago, but today figured I'd load up the old save and wreak havoc. Problem is, when I loaded the game, it brought me to the first cutscene and the beginning of the game. I try a restart. Again, same thing. Pity, it's a good game, but this port is ruined by a sloppy system of saves being ruined by updates.There's apparently a user made save editor that can convert the game's saves to newer versions an save them, but I tried it and it isn't working.All I can say is Rockstar, we get it. You can't stand pc gamers after the Hot Coffee incident, but you could at least pretend to like us.			"

												This game is fantastic. Although the graphics are a bit outdated, the gameplay is great. The animations for the characters and objects are smooth and flowing. The fire from the flamethrower can be spread on the ground. There are so many things to do, and if you feel like it, activate some cheats, and wreck havok on all of Los Santos with all the weapons you need + all the mods you could ever want. Its also the only GTA game where you can control cranes and trains at any time you want. This game was one of the greatest on PS2 in 2004, and I still think it holds that title. Its kinda like a demake of GTA 5 from my perspective.If you see a copy of this game, go get it and play it! You will have loads of fun!			"

But what I love in this game the most are myths, one of the most interesting things in this game, you can drive around whole San Andreas visit many places investigate them find something plus there are many interesting easter eggs too... I won't tell you more you better play it yourself you will definately enjoy it.			"

												Best game ever made; and that is a fact, not a statement. Not really in terms of story or gameplay, both are okay, but the little things that can happen at any point. I've played this game ever since it first came out, and I'm still finding things that make me laugh to tears.The PC version isn't a flawless port, but the ability to use mods is a nice plus. Also, the ability to create your own radio station is cool too.I know that it might seem as if it has little to offer in comparison to the newer games, but San Andreas' is made for all time.			"

												I'll be honest: I like San Andreas a HELL of a lot more than I do GTA IV. There are still some things the Saints Row series does better (ability to shoot out of cars with more than a SMG, 360 aiming while in a car, cruise control, gang warfare is better), San Andreas is STILL worth playing. Just don't do any of the gang wars during the first Los Santos chapter. You don't get to keep any progress in it when you're exiled.			"

(By the way, the song is also in the game. Coincidence?

Hooked it up for later as I hit the do' Thinkin will I live, another twenty-fo' I gotta go cause I got me a drop top And if I hit the switch, I can make the ♥♥♥ drop Had to stop, at a red light Lookin in my mirror and not a jacker in sight And everything is alright I got a beep from Kim, and she can ♥♥♥♥ all night Called up the homies and I'm askin y'all Which park, are y'all playin basketball? Get me on the court and I'm trouble Last week ♥♥♥♥ed around and got a triple double Freakin ♥♥♥♥♥z everyway like M.J. I can't believe, today was a good day (♥♥♥♥!)[Verse Two] Drove to the pad and hit the showers Didn't even get no static from the cowards Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me Saw the police and they rolled right past me No flexin, didn't even look in a ♥♥♥♥♥'s direction as I ran the intersection Went to $hort Dog's house, they was watchin Yo! MTV Raps What's the haps on the craps? Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em Roll 'em in a circle of ♥♥♥♥♥z and watch me break 'em with the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven Seven even back do' Lil' Joe I picked up the cash flow Then we played bones, and I'm yellin domino Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A. Today was a good day (♥♥♥♥!)[Verse Three] Left my ♥♥♥♥♥'s house paid (what) Picked up a girl been tryin to ♥♥♥♥ since the 12th grade It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic The Lakers beat the Supersonics I felt on the big fat fanny Pulled out the jammy, and killed the punanny And my ♥♥♥♥ runs deep, so deep So deep put her ♥♥♥ to sleep Woke her up around one She didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion I was glad everything had worked out Dropped her ♥♥♥ off and then chirped out Today was like one of those fly dreams Didn't even see a berry flashin those high beams No helicopter looking for a murder  Two in the mornin got the Fatburger  Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp And it read, ""Ice Cube's a pimp"" (yeah) Drunk as hell but no throwin up  Half way home and my pager still blowin up Today I didn't even have to use my A.K.

												Having been a fan of the series since GTA III, and seeing that each game has its own pros and cons (not excluding this one), I have to admit GTA: San Andreas is still my favorite.  The stoyline / voice acting is arguably the best in the series, with no shortage of wacky characters as you'd come to expect from a Rockstar game.  Plently of diverse missions and locations to explore (a massive map for its time) with exellent character customization.I only recently purchased San Andreas on Steam but have sunk countless hours since its intial release on the PS2.  It's definitely worth the price tag for this classic, and a no-brainer if you happen upon it on sale.			"

												First of all , I would like to say that this game is a triple AAA clasic!One of the classic games that everyone should have the opportunity to play !But lets get this review organized:Graphics - 65/100To evaluate the grapics you have to keep on mind that this game is , effectivelly , a game from 2004, so you cannot be expecting to be tremendously beautyfull, it is beautyfull if you compare it to the other games from this especific generation.But one thing I have to admit, I love those beaches! Los Santos <3Sounds- 75/100Oh gosh , how I love to get in a car and live again those 90s musics . One of the things that I did not like about it , is a recent update that took some of my joys off. Copying one guy ----- ""Rockstar you a busta! "" Story-98/100.PERFECT STORY ! In this game you can live the life of Carl Johnson ( C.J) that came back to his city to assist to his mother funeral. As he gots here , he realizes that his gangsta crew was weak and dying and the others crew like the Ballas were getting better and bigger.He knew that he cannot turn his face around and ignore his familly , so he does a couple things to help the crew. He feels part of the team again and starts to live the thing again. You will be CJ that will try to seek the truth about his mothers death and will try to raise once again the glory of the Groove Street gang.Gameplay- 80/100You have 3 citys - Los Santos , San Fierro , Las Venturas , and 2 ""country "" zones , the Desert one , and the mountain one .Thats enough ! You have 10000000 things to do!In the end i consider that this game evaluation is 80/100 because it is an analyze from 2015, if this was an analyze from 2004 I would give without any doubt 99/100			"

												G R A N D  T H E F T  A U T O  :  S A N  A N D R E A SAhhh, so much nostalgia playing this game.Even today, the game is still playable, and no I'm not saying it's better than GTA V (only dumb ♥♥♥♥♥ say that.) HOWEVER, this is the game that no one will ever forget it, of how great this is. When I was at 4th grade my friends and classmates would never stop talking about this game. We used to have cheats on a piece of paper, good ol' days. Some homies I know still play it. I never get it finish it though. Right now I am!This is the best, fully gangsta type game ever. GOOD:- So many clothes to wear!- Exercises makes you buffer and stronger, while eating more makes you fatter, neither those will make you skinny. Even GTA IV/V don't have this feature anymore! What happened!? This is so realistic!!- Minigames- Memorable characters- Perfect story- Really long story. Seriously! I thought one more mission then I could finish the game but NOPE I'm still at the 6/7th one! I never completed the game even now!- 8 Major gangs. This so great. You start with Gang Street Families, but unfortunately you cannot be other factions, but it's fun to stay with the story.- That camera that takes pics into real files. I loved that one!- Memorable moments / quotes- Very fun screwing around the lively city of Los Santos.- Story about gangsters/blacks. Nowadays I feel like black people in video games don't care about anything, like Franklin. God, he's so boring. I felt CJ is more funnier and dramatic person he is. BAD:- Updates that removed so many good content and also breaks the mods- Terrible controls. Ever since I was a kid, why the ♥♥♥♥ would anyone bind sprint as SPACE, jump as SHIFT, ENTER to exit menus and SHIFT to open to the next link as default?Final Verdict: The story and gangsta theme is better than GTA V, but it doesn't mean that's bad, I like both games but SA brings memories and many customizations. The first time I played it when I was like 7 or 8, it first came from a computer I bought (some computers have illegal games from the store but that was fun. Always tricked my parents) Now that I'm a young adult, turns out I didn't became a serial killer.  Steam edition: 0/10 > Trash can ♥♥♥♥♥Why bother porting it on Steam when you remove the good things inside it? I will exaggerate by using Hot Coffee patch. ♥♥♥♥ you whoever did this!Actual game: 10/10YOU PICKED THE WRONG REVIEW, FOOL!			"

												GTA SA is one of the best games I have ever played. However, since I love it so much I have created an idol out of it in my life. As a Christian, I am not allowed to play it as I asked myself, ""would Christ play this game with me?"" So, I put to death that which I love and deny myself since Christ, when he came down to earth, denied himself to do the will of The Father and died for our sins. I challenge my brothers and sisters in Christ to do the same and follow Christ, our forerunner and saviour. Be strong and deny yourself to do His will and not ours. I know it's tough but, when you realize what Christ has done for us and remove yourself (deny oneself) from the throne of your life and allow Christ to sit there. Only then can we truly serve Him. God bless and Godspeed.			"
