												This game from Sigma Team is an easy to pick isometric shooter. Despite it's age and graphics, the fun factor is great. Also, the small but effective improvements you can buy allow you a bit of customisation on the gameplay style. Different weapons ARE different, and you have to be careful with reload times. Hordes and hordes of aliens come to get you. You can also use the environment on yourfavor, like doors , corridors ans such. Sound assests are good. When you mix aliens with explosions, grenade launchers and mayhem, it gets really really rewarding.Usually this game along with others (from Sigma Team) appear on bundles, or heavily discounted not only on steam but also in other sites (i.e. Indie Gala). When you are bored, and want a quick and mindless session you can fire a chapter, or even play a survival session. Play it with v-sync off, to avoid some problems. It runs on a toaster, so it's perfect for those (like me) that have ancient hardware around.

												Okay, this game looks like an Alien shooter with reworked graphics, so i would compare them that way:The gameplay itself is nearly identical to the 1st alien shooter - to complete the levels you have to kill every single mob on the map, you have plenty of secrets hidden in walls, you have exactly same enemies pool, and same weapons to kill them + same great OST. So what is different: - money balance - you receive less money from levels, even with all the secrets found, you can feel how its harder to buy stuff. - weapons reworked to more pleasurable in usage - instead of pistol you now have Uzi, semi-auto shotgun etc etc.- multiple levels for drone upgrades- more detailed statistics at the end of the levels AND it shows a number of secrets on the previous levels, so you can replay the level if you did not found all of them- you can REPLAY any level that you beat before- more difficulties up to IMPOSSIBLE which is unbeatable - the level designs are close to the original levels, but they are different, bigger and contain WAY more secrets than an older one.


Alien shooter rework 
Community Created Artwork for Alien Shooter: Revisited
By: XJ9

			Slightly improved Alien shooter 1		


Graphics now darker, less colorful and more alienish, that fits the game good, because of aliens and their guts all around contrast that stuff very good. Now about the problems of that game:Both Original alien shooter is from 2003 and this one is from 2009 and yet, this game is less compatible with modern computers, if you have older machines it would run great, but if you have modern PC and win 7-8-10 x64 you may face various problems, like without Vsync, you can't move the camera, fps drops when enemy appear and so on. If you have the camera glitch - turn on Force Vsync in your video card settings OR go the game directory find there .cfg file and edit it with notepad in that string with Vsync=0 to Vsync=1,Maximum resolution is 1024x768 and no windowed mode -  If the low-res fullscreen is really a problem for you - as far as I remember *Dxwnd* (google it like Dxwnd window mode) should do the trick :)As well as the original Alien shooter - this game would be awesome if someone would make HD remakeOverall this game is good if you lucky enough don't face the bugs (Not space bugs :) )			"

												My introduction to Sigma Team's ""Shooter"" series. I played this game some years ago when it was distributed by Reflexive Arcade. A low-budget, low-tech top-down shooter, its nonetheless very fun, full of absolutely ENOURMOUS hordes of enemies that virtually put Serious Sam to shame. The game and its various sequels and spinoffs do only one thing, and they do it well.			"

												Well I can't recommend this, first and for most flaw is camera, if you go up it is ok but when you want to go down camera almost sticking to your character, you can't see any enemies ahead and shoot them = you are dead before you know it. In first couple levels it can be managed with slow moving but later game is totally unplayable because of this. Other than this even if this game is "" remastered"" it showing it's age very much, and on top of that only 1024x768 as max resolution? :)			"

												An enjoyable top down shooter with a plethora of enemies to destroy. However this game feels like a quick money grab since its almost exactly the same as the original game. If you already have Alien Shooter 1 already rather stick with it and dont look at getting Revisited. Additionally the game has one of the WORST camera's ive had the misfortune of dealing with. My advice is rather stick with AS 1 or AS2.			"

												Alien Shooter Revisited takes you back to the campaign of the original Alien Shooter but with many of the new features introduced in Alien Shooter 2.Alien Shooter Revisited is a isometric shooter where you run through a a secret laboratory while fighting off what seems like unending hordes of aliens hellbent on your gory demise.As you progress through the levels you gain access to better and stronger weapons and the games level of gore reaches rather insane levels towards the end where entire maps will be painted red with alien intestines. You also have access to two separate last stand horde modes where you fend off a truly never ending mass of aliens as either a person or a static gun turret until you are overcome for the sake of high scores.This time around, you get to pick from a number of different characters each with slightly different stats and in between missions you get access to the shop menu from Alien Shooter 2. The graphics have also been improved to match the later games.This is all however, not nearly enough. Alien Shooter wasn't a great game and neither was it's sequel. Simply adding a few features on top of the same old missions does make this worthy of a replay or even a new purchase for newcomers to the series.There is nothing really worthy of note in this repackaged version and the updates made are easily forgettable. If you honestly want to play one of the Alien/Zombie Shooter games then you should pick one of the sequels as they are slightly less lacking than the old versions, even ""revisited"" ones.			"

												If you are a fan of Zombie Shooter, also a game created by Sigma, then this is the kind of game for you, however not with nearly the amount of gameplay hours as Zombie Shooter has.I bought this game as part of a package many years ago, but only now decided to finally give this game a shot. Is it worth buying? Not really in my opinion. 1. I manage to complete the game on medium within three hours. Now granted, the game can be quite difficult even on medium difficulty, which means if you really want to gain hours from the game, play it on impossible difficulty. It is quite an annoying difficulty to play on, but to each their own I suppose.2. The game doesn't really offer anything else other than, walk into level, blow MASSES of aliens up and complete the level. Of course after each very short level you make a ton of cash that you spend on permanent stats upgrades and a couple of things like weapons (which are essential in some levels) and of course lives to survive a bit longer. Yes, there are many games that follow the same principle of only blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up that I am a massive fan of, but this one is just not one of them.3. Yes, the game is fun to some extent... but again it didn't last very long until things just became too tedious and ridiculous. Some times, the level is so alien infested that you need a specific weapon just to get past their numbers, which if you didn't buy before the level started, you'll have to restart the level and make sure you spend money on that weapon. On the same note, once you get the last and most powerful weapon, there is literally nothing, and no amount of their numbers that can stop you, unless you make silly mistakes.Finally, this is suppose to be a remastered version of the original. I couldn't play the original because of problems with Windows 10, but this game probably offered a bit more visuals than the original.Again, it was fun while it lasted, but I don't recommend any paying money for this game.

												This game was promising in the beginning then it started to become bad and then complete crap.  The guns are fun to use but in the later levels, only the minigun types and explosives are worth using, or else you will find yourself seeing the main menu countless of times. I understand the approach this game takes, but making a level difficult isnt about spawning endless hordes of enemies which outgun you, the right way is making the AI more competent ( learn from Nuclear Throne please!!). I got this in a bundle and I am very glad I did as this is one of the worst top down shooter I have ever played. Absolutely cheap difficulty scaling and death! And the explosive sound effects are horrible.			"

												Alien Shooter: Revisted is an updated version of Alien Shooter. It has been ported to an engine that looks very similar to Alien Shooter 2, and comes with all the improvements you might expect from that process. Some of the flaws that haunt the original game still appear in this one, however.Like you would expect, Alien Shooter: Revisted involves shooting lots of aliens, and that may be an understatement. On some levels your kill count will be up in the thousands. You control with WASD and shoot with the mouse, holding down the left button to shoot and using the cursor to aim.The style of this game is an isometric top down shooter. I found that the isometric view could actually be a hindrance at times, with many enemies being hidden along the wall. You will find yourself being injured by aliens that you could not possibly see, and I have a slight problem with that.The graphics have been drastically improved from the last version, and some light RPG elements have been added. You can purchase upgrades to your skills or weaponry, however a lot of weaponry can be found in the open throughout the levels. The enemies and characters have some additional detail over the original, and the environments have been give a new coat of paint. This looks more like a commercial title and less like a free flash game that the original did.The game still lacks voice acting or much of a story. You just kind of dive in to the scenario, committing genocide without much thought. With Alien Shooter 2 having much more story going on, it makes its absence well missed in this game.While Alien Shooter: Revisted has welcome improvements over the original, it is still missing too much to warrant much of your time. Without much of a story going on, and the upgrade elements still feeling a little too light, I would skip this in favor of Alien Shooter 2: Reloaded or another shooter.Grade: D+			"

												A remake of a good old alien shooter which is unfortunately unplayble for me. It's difficult to explain. Actually a camera is supposed to follow a crosshair but it doesn't. Your charachter just runs to the edge of screen and remains there. As a result you are unable to see what's going on in front of you - is there a tonn of mobs or is it some kind of pick up? No way! You will know only when you bump in it. So i started dying  already on a second or third level cause i was just unable to see what was ahead of me. Ofcourse i tried reinstalling, searched for different solutions on forums, but nothing helped.			"

												Aside from a pretty niche audience, Alien shooter is a pretty low profile game. The X shooter games are well put together, even if they do look like a poorly rendered game made in the early 2000s. Gamplay is solid, and the action is fun while it lasts, but you kinda forget about it once your finished.

												Sigma Team has managed to sh*t out a real turkey this time. Would not bother with this one because there are many better games in the series.Here's why:1: Useless starting weapon. - Sure, it is has unlimited ammunition so it is okay for breaking crates but that's it. - Becomes utterly useless half-way into the second level    (In first level you only break crates and blow up barrels).- You will have great difficulty killing even the easiest enemies, let alone a larger group.- In the original Alien Shooter you started with dual pistols that were actually useful.1: Endlessly respawning enemies. - Basically if you don't rush trough the levels you will run out of ammunition and the mission    will become uncompletable because the enemies will respawn faster than you can kill them to get even close to objective.2: Small ammo pools. - You rarely find enough ammunitionto complete a mission. The purchased ammunition is quickly used up,    making it very hard to manage it trough the levels unless you use the crappy starting weapon to tickle enemies to death.3: Unusable shop interface, - From what I have seen, in between the levels you are taken into a ""shop"" screen,    but you can not buy what you like. There are only a few options on what to buy,    and there is no way to upgrade the weapons you already got.    And when you buy a new weapon in a new slot,    they will not tell what it is beforehand.    You can sell it back to get a full refund but...    Want a different gun? Nope, you got no choice. That or nothing.   Also, you can not sell back the weapons you have bought or picked up earlier,    preventing any strategies on how to upgrade.   But why bother?    Usually the next weapon can be found somewhere behind a secret on the next level anyway.4: About 90% of the art assets are recycled from the original Alien Shooter, released in 2003.    This game was released in 2010. Sigma Team seems to have gotten complacent and    seems to be content to just re-hash old content without any significant improvements.    Even the music is the same. In fact, they seem to have made it worse instead.But it is not all bad. The game is more or less the same and gameplay on the levels has not been changed.To sum it up, this is more of the same, and would not recommend buying it unless you are a hardcore fan.I'd recommend buying one of the following instead:- Alien Shooter (The original or with ""The Experiment"" add-on)- Alien Shooter 2 (AKA Alien Shooter: Vengeance)- Alien Shooter 2: Conscription- Zombie Shooter- Zombie Shooter 2I'd rate this 4/7.

												the alien shooter games are none of that pseudo retro cr4p you get everywhere today. these games actually ARE retro!but take a look at the screenshots first. if they make you want to hurl then this kind of game certainly isn't made for you.if you don't mind the old graphics or maybe even like them then you're in for a good time!of course there is some kind of story going on but as you can imagine it's all about splattering aliens all over the place with really big a$$ guns.as you can see the graphics aren't exactly top-notch but i feel like they fit nicely into the whole old-school setting of these games.you gain xp, level up and distribute your attribute points pretty much rpg-like as you see fit. you loot the environment to get your hands on ammo and new items as well as collect money to buy yourself some decent gear and new shiny boomsticks at the trader.the map design is quite decent and there are even a lot of secret areas to be found.pretty straight forward gameplay but surprisingly big fun and entertaining.grab the whole package on sale or in a bundle and start mowing down the alien scum!

												AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH....   It says I played two hours.   Yes... 2 hours.   0.5 hours on the first 90% of the game, and 1.5 hours on the last level of the game.   It was on Medium and for some reason all the 3000+ aliens decided to make me their girlfriend in the corridors.  I don't know if the game glitched and I ended up on a harder difficulty but this game absolutely yanked the floor mat out from under me.   I was playing Alien Shooter 1 & 2 for old time sake and saw this one... so I played it after beating the other two earlier tonight.... I decdied to try this and beat it in an hour.   NOooooooOOooooo... this one said ""YOU WANT SOME?!!!"" and brought the hurt.    So yeah, I did beat it.   Slicing the Pie, Solitary Bounding Overwatch, and having to run around like a little girl screaming ""in the game"" allowed me to finish the last level.   Now I'm going to go rethink my enjoyment of games.   10/10 would suffer again.    :) I recommend anyone getting all three of these to play the original Alien Shooter first... just so you can see what is different.   Enjoy.			"
