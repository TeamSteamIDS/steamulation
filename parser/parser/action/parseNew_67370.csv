												Do you like comics?Do you like atmosphere?Do you like having two demonic tentacle heads protruding from your back that allow you to whip, grab, dismember, and look bad♥♥♥♥♥Welcome to The Darkness 2.The single player campaign is not too long depending on difficulty level and your level of expertise, but I found the story and atmosphere so refined that I thoroughly enjoyed my play through and recommended it. Also of note is the Vendettas campaign. There is a 4 player online co-op that intertwines with the single player story filling in some back story. Overall Vendettas is a fun diversion with friends but a little repetitive. You don't get to play as the main character Jackie, instead one of a set of four mercenaries that each have a personal weapon infused with Dark Essence.Now for the gameplay. The Darkness II finally disproves the theory that developers have to leave the main protagonist as hollow as possible in first person shooters so that the gamers can fully immerse themselves. This is just lazy storytelling and don't let anyone tell you differently. The Darkness is a game of two parts. Light and dark. Players experience the tender heart of Jackie when he is around Jenny and Aunt Sarah. But then players go out and start shooting guys and flinging fan blades at them with one demon arm while decapitating them with the other demon arm. In The Darkness II you quad-wield and your survival depends on it. At first it can seem a bit much to keep track of, grabbing things and throwing things and slashing and shooting all at once. But once you learn to multitask you will feel like a God. It's intoxicating. The Darkness becomes an extension of your will and soon you are slaying rooms full of enemies with gleeful abandon. There is an upgrade system to tailor the combat to your preferences and the point system that pays for your new abilities will encourage you to perform gruesome executions. The game is bloody. But due to a smart move on the developer's behalf, the cell-shaded comic style graphics make all the gore less disgusting. This time around the enemies have their own supernatural weapons at their disposal, a noted improvement over the last game.Inside all of us there's a violent beast that needs to be sated, lets it bleed over into our real lives. This game does just that. Incredibly violent, and intensely satisfying. My only wish is that it were longer. Great fun; A must have.			"

												I do not like shooters. Yes, you read it well. And I'm not a fan of super power/super heroes/action games. Add to these that the game is short and linear. It doesn't look ugle but its picture is not modern even for 2012-year-game at the same time. And yeah, it's buggy. And, please, take into your account that it is almost the end of the 2014, November, almost 3 years since the game release.And I've finished it. And I liked it as this game has the most interesting part that beats others weaknesses - its story line. It keeps you to the end like an addictive movie. Like a movie you want to recommend to your friends after all. It's almost 3 years since this game release and it still can be recommended. I also like this game has skill trees. You won't be able to get all skills but, well, you don't need all of them anyway =) Are you tired with shooting your enemies? Smash them with snakes, throws a chair or grab somebody by his leg. Despite of serious story and bloody scenes a gameplay can be very funny and relaxing.Last thing I wanted to mention is characters. They are well-made. You won't meet a lot of dialogs but you will feel each character as individual with its own identity. Many games have NPCs you pass like strangers and never come back or remember them. I remember all characters from this game and they supplement the plot and the gameplay. Thank you for your time and have a good play!			"

												n a strange coincidence I started playing The Darkness II at about roughly the same time I started Alan Wake. The plots in each game revolve heavily on light and darkness, which is really just a play on the classic good vs. evil conflict. In Alan Wake the protagonist uses light as a weapon to destroy and evade evil, but in The Darkness II the protagonist depends on the darkness to literally envelop himself in evil to defeat enemies, becoming the monstrous “host” of the Darkness.Jackie Estacado, Don of the Franchetti family, has laid low with the Darkness bottled up for two years following the death of his girlfriend Jenny. After a failed attempt on his life, Jackie is ready to unleash the Darkness once again, to exact revenge and to continue fighting for Jenny. His new enemies have been tracking him for years, and their leader, Victor Valente, is after the Darkness for himself. Jackie also faces a reality problem, not knowing if what he is experiencing is real while having several brief visions of a psychiatric ward throughout the game.Before I continue I’d first like to include a precautionary note. The Darkness II is definitely what I’d refer to as an adult oriented game. The entire thing revolves around harnessing evil for violence, has many demonic themes (eating hearts of dead enemies to regain health, collecting dark relics for points, etc.), includes adult themes, and is not something I’d ever buy for a kid. With the appropriate rating there’s nothing wrong that. I’m not discounting the game for this at all, but the “dark” themes turned me off a bit, and I’d guess that reactions to these themes among FPS fans would be mixed.With that note out of the way, I’d like to continue with an annoyance. Game assistants, such as Wheatly in Portal 2, seem to be popping up more and more these days. The inclusion of the Darkling in The Darkness II was fine functionally, but it seemed like the character was intended to appeal to a younger audience, which didn’t make much sense to me. For example, there were several times where the Darkling would run up to an enemy’s body I had just killed to pass gas or urinate on it. If you’re making an adult game, I just don’t quite understand why you would include something like this. The Darkling just seemed too offensive to me; I wasn’t able to appreciate the character at all. I also feel like the horror element to the game would have been enhanced if the player were forced to play alone.On the positive side I’d say that despite playing on rails, The Darkness II is a fairly solid and intense first-person shooter. I didn’t encounter any bugs or gameplay issues, and there were plenty of enemies to kill. Locales were mixed, and even though I found it a bit cliché, the vacant carnival level was definitely an enjoyable setting. There weren’t exactly a large variety of weapons, but the inclusion of the ability tree, in which new abilities can be purchased with dark essence points, helped. The abilities tree seemed like kind of an afterthought on the whole, but it’s better than just having generic weapons. Items such as extended gun clips, a swarm distraction to stun enemies, and better weapon handling can be purchased in the abilities tree. The Darkness itself is really the most powerful weapon, which can destroy enemies in a couple of swipes if they’re close enough. When things got crazy and I was surrounded by enemies the Darkness always seemed to allow me to break out; it was pretty incredible to use.Another strong point of The Darkness II was the voice acting. It wasn’t all great, but I was especially impressed with David Hoffman’s portrayal of the half deranged occultist Johnny Powell (example trailer linked) and Brian Bloom as the new voice of Jackie. The loading segments in which each of these characters reveal more of the storyline were some of the most memorable portions of the game. Voice acting in video games can vary quite a bit, and it’s not usually very good; this game is definitely an exception. Sound effects and music were also decent.Visuals were also a positive, but you shouldn’t go into it expecting total realism. The Darkness II was developed using cel-shaded animation, which is different from the first game. The cel-shading was different than what I have seen before in that it was subtle and at times almost unnoticeable. There was definitely a nice balance between realism and animation, which really made it seem as if I was experiencing the graphic novel on which the game is based.In terms of difficulty, I’d have to say that I didn’t find The Darkness II overly challenging. The AI was easy to avoid and fool for the most part, but there were a few portions that I had to replay several times to finally move forward. Being equipped with the Darkness felt as if I was much more powerful than the majority of the enemies.In addition to the single-player campaign The Darkness II also includes a Vendetta mode in which you can carry out missions for Jackie as one of four characters with special powers. These missions can be played alone or in co-op mode, but the Vendettas are definitely not the main attraction. It’s one of those extra things thrown in that you try once or twice but to which you never come back.Overall, I’d say that The Darkness II is a decent shooter, but there is nothing in it that is amazing; it’s respectable but mostly predictable. Playing a more or less “evil” character felt different compared to all the other standard “save the Earth” games, but other than the Darkness it doesn’t include much that hasn’t been done before. The story and voice acting is a big plus. The main campaign isn’t that long, and the AI isn’t the greatest, but it is intense and still enjoyable if you’re an FPS fan.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: The Darkness II Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: FPS; Dark; Action; Psychological; Story Rich My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 6-18 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Auxiliary Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseursREVIEWThe Darkness II is an action FPS with strong narrative elements and a stylish, graphic-noir atmosphere.  The gameplay feels both familiar and fresh simultaneously, while the characters and story keep the player engaged and interested.  Also, the addition of an XP system and skill-trees allow the player to continue to work towards new goals and to customize their character according to their preferred combat style.  All of these elements mesh together to create a very enjoyable game that I feel all but the most extremely discerning gamers should appreciate.One of the most intriguing aspects of The Darkness II is the story, and the characters that make it.  The twisted and confused thoughts of the main character set the tone of the game from the first level, and evolve as the story progresses, in a similar fashion to games like Max Payne and Alan Wake.  The auxiliary characters are diverse and interesting, enticing the player to initiate optional conversations. The narrative is a perfect blend of mafia drama and psychological thriller that should enthrall anyone who enjoys being told a good story.The actual gameplay experience is also exquisite.  The combination of familiar FPS aspects with some well-integrated novelty goes a long way to make the game downright fun.  There are various guns and abilities to use to wreak havoc on your enemies during action-packed fight sequences.  Additionally, the XP and skill-point system will keep you goal-oriented and allow you to unlock new abilities as you play to keep things fresh.For those itching for more after beating the main campaign, there is also an entirely separate Co-op Mode, which expands upon the universe of The Darkness II and allows for multiplayer gameplay.  Fortunately, all the missions in the Co-op Mode can be completed in solo play if you don’t want to spend time trying to find others to play with.  While not quite as pristine as the main campaign, it adequately provides some supplementary gameplay to a game that would otherwise be only medium-length (in terms of total hours).In summary, I posit that The Darkness II is a superb all-around game with many positive elements contributing to its overall quality.  I would say it is a pretty safe bet for most gamers who have a broad taste for games, and a definite safe bet for those gamers who enjoy FPS games and interesting narratives.  Expect about 6-18 hours of gameplay, depending on how much of a “completionist” you are.  If you can get it for a price you are comfortable with, it is definitely worth the pick-up.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												It doesn't take you long to be pulled into the story. The Darkness 2 does a great job of immersing you into the feelings and thoughts of the main character, which is a rarity in modern day gaming. Often you are very disconected from the story and the emotions of the characters. Lately, the only other game I have played that did such a great job of pulling you in, emotionally, was BioShock Infinite.Beyond the story, which while nothing especially impressive, what is there is enough and is well orcestrated. The most impressive feat is the game's ability to put you in the shoes of the main character and really doubt what is real and what is not real (in the game).The gameplay is top notch though and if you enjoy shooters where you run from one area to the next and have to clear all the waves of enemies, then this is a game for you. The gunplay is fun and has impact and the tentacles are well implemented so that they are not overpowered and yet are still very fun and exciting to use.

I found myself using primarily guns but definitely had to use my powers frequently to stay in the fight. I was glad though that the powers did not dominate the gameplay so that you simply use the powers when you feel the need and are not forced to constantly use the powers. In some games where you have powers they dominate the other gameplay mechanics to the point that you find yourself only using the powers and nothing else. Fortunately, this is not the case in the Darkness 2.

The graphics are not impressive or special, but they make up for what they lack in the style, which once you've played the game to completion the style will make sense. A lot of people were surprised when they first revealed the first gameplay video of The Darkness 2 because of the art style they had used. But there is a definite reason for it and it only further helps immerse you into the world of confusion that the main character is living in.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=304361384The soundtrack is great and the voice work is top quality. All in all, it is a very fun game with a decent story that manages to pull you in and leaves you desiring more.Would definitely recommend giving this game a spin! It is a great purchase and a great experience to play through once or even twice! In addition there are even some co-op missions to further the experience, so if you have a friend to play it with it will add a few more hours of quality gameplay.			"

												The Darkness 2Rating 8/10Overview: Underrated First Person ShooterThe Good:+ Cell shaded graphics + The game has a strong narrative which holds the game together otherwise it would turn into a mindless shooter. Although the plot itself is pretty basic the developers did a great job of presenting the story. The characters may be stereotypical of what you would expect in a mafia however it doesn't take away the fact they are believable and expertly voiced.   + The game features a variety of guns which is what you would expect from any first person shooter however the twist in this game is that you have two demonic arms, one for picking/throwing objects and the other as a high powered melee weapon. You can also execute enemies in some pretty horrific ways.  + Speaking of gratuitous violence, it works well in this game. Most games have over the top violence just for the sake of it yet I feel this game really nailed this particular aspect, it really sells the notion that you are possessed by dark forces.  + Killing enemies and collecting relics in the levels allows you to level up different skills among 4 skill trees. + New Game + allows you to replay the game with all your acquired skills + Easy Achievements, minimal grinding required. + Great voice acting+ Good soundtrack The Average: On the one hand the game is short, roughly 5-7 hours in length. On the other hand the game isn't bogged down with pointless filler either, the game does what it wants to without over extending its welcome. After you complete the main story, you can try the vendetta campaign, an add on to extend your playtime. You can choose between 4 characters, each with their own weapon, skill trees and powers. You can also play co-op with friends. The problem however is that every level becomes very repetitive of killing wave after wave of enemy. The formula wears itself out very early on. This mode is also very short , roughly 2-3 hours in length. The Bad:- Multiplayer is dead  ConclusionIt was a sequel that didn't need to be made but in the end it turned out to be a great game to a very underappreciated game franchise. A fun distraction while it lasts and nothing more. Strongly recommend at a discount price.  "

												The Darkness II features unique gameplay that lets you fight with 4 arms (2 human arms & 2 demon arms) and use demonic powers.The graphics, story, setting, characters, and voice acting are all really well done and nicely compliment the unique gameplay. Co-op mode also has it's own interesting story that's related to the main game's story and you can play through it solo if you don't have any friends.			"

												Linear action FPS game with a lot of violence, blood and vulgarity. Basically it's like playing a horror game but YOU ARE THE HORROR!What I love most about this game is the story-telling, the narrative of the game. All the characters in this game have their own personality, even the crazy ones! The person who voiced Johnny Powell is a genius!There is a multiplayer mode called the ""Vandette"". It has a number of co-op missions that you can play solo or play with up to 4 players online. Each playable characters have their own personality and their own dialogues as well! The multiplayer campaign fills in the holes in the single player story very well. This is one of the rarer games where the multiplayer mode actually adds value to the single player story-telling.The artsy graphics adds a lot of nostalgic feel to the game environment. This type of graphics rendering method also brilliantly mask away a lot of disgust from the bloody violence where it would be gross if rendered too realistically.If you are the reading type and like to understand as much of the game world as possible, you can learn a lot from reading the relics origin. The game universe is based a lot closely to our real world religions, with a little fictional element added into it. And it makes a lot of sense! (On top of that, it has the funny narration from the crazy genius!)It has moderate replay value. Once you are done with the single player campaign, you can replay the campaign with new game plus to learn more about the game setting and to hunt for collectibles. But it's only worth 2-3 playthrus before it gets repetitive. Multiplayer have quite a number of maps but since multiplayer characters have very limited skillset, it gets repetitive very soon.All the achievements are quite doable in single player, 100% completion is not difficult.My Score: 10/10 (Highly recommended!)

												I doubt that you have ever heard of 2006's console exclusive the Darkness or the comic books published by Top Cow Productions (yes, that's the actual name... I couldn't make that one up) of the same name, so let me tell you a little bit about the unpopular The Darkness II.Or The Darkness 2 if you don't know your Roman numerals. If you don't, shame on you.In The Darkness II you play as Jackie Estacado, a member of the Franchetti crime family. He was adopted by the former Don of the Franchetti's, Frankie Franchetti at the age of six and matured quickly; he lost his virginity to a female officer durning an investigation at the age of fourteen and killed his first victim at the age of sixteen. His presence in the Franchetti family helped it to expand, as predicted by the mysterious Sonatine.When Jackie turned twenty-one, he revieved the powers of the Darkness, a timeless power allowing the Host to form basically anything out of darkness (for example, the Arms) that will crumble to dust in the light. To keep it short, lots of sh*t hit the fan in a short period of time, causing his true love Jenny to be killed. Years passed since then, and Jackie forced himself to keep the Darkness locked up inside of him after blaming it for Jenny's death. That's where the second game begins and the Darkness gets unleashed again.Sound interresting? Well trust me, it IS interresting.The Good:· Very solid shooter mechanics.· An upgrade-system that will make you feel more powerful as the game progresses.· You can control Jackie's sentient demon arms to grab enemies and objects and perform brutal finishing moves. (For example splitting a guy clean in half or ripping someone's spine out of his sh*tter. I know. His f*cking sh*tter. They just rip that open harder than Kim Kardashian's c*nt.)· A surprisingly personal and meaningful story that will keep you interrested until the very end.· The Darkness 2 plays with light in a unique way - standing in light will blind you and make you more volnurable, but being in the darkness makes you brutally strong.The Bad:· The co-op missions can easily be forgotten.· Besides tha campaign, collectibles and co-op the game offers too little content to keep you coming back to it.· Unfortunately unsuccesful, meaning that the chances of a third installment is highly unlikely.The Ugly:While the comicbook-esque and gore-filled visuals are a joy to look at, there's nothing too stunning about it. It never looks bad, but it doesn't look as good as it could have.Final verdict:This is a title I will always remember for its dark and unique setting, plus it's one of the forgotten ""good comicbook games"" out there that needs to be played, simply because it's an thrilling experience. 8.5/10			"

												You can skip to the bottom of the review for the TL;DRThe Darkness 2 is one of my personal favourites in a long list of games on my steam account. It is everything you could possibly want from a first person shooter that has a noire feeling to it, with light horror elements and an interesting story that will keep you hooked.The story, without spoiling anything, is a direct sequel for the first part, meaning eveything ties up and the timelines are logical. Basically: you are Jackie Estacado, a young mafia member with dark powers beyond control,that seeks vengeance.The plot gets better and makes more sense as you play through the game. You have choices, tough it's not a primary element of the game and the story and levels are rather linear, choices only representing the question ""do you want one more cutscene?"", most of the times.The gameplay is where this game really excels at. You have the basic fps mechanics with a strong emphasis on the signature dual wield of Jackie, which can carry 3 weapons with him- a primary, a secondary and another secondary, with the option to dual the secondaries or carefully aim with them. Besides that, the power of the darkness system is truly a breath of fresh air for the genre. Jackie has, at all times, 2 demon arms besides him that, if controlled right, can do huge amounts of damage just on their own. Tactically combined with the generic fps mechanics, they can adapt to any situation and turn the tides of battle in a second with specific skills. They can slash, execute enemies in exchange for health, ammo, etc, grab objects from the enviroment to use them as either defense or gory offense. Your godly powers go away in the light tough, as the game offers dynamic light gameplay elements, requiring you to think strategically before encounters as you shoot lights out and cut down heads.The game also has a skill tree system, featuring 4 different skill trees that all branch out from a primary ability and that can be leveled simultaneously. The primary skill adds a new mechanic, eating the hearts of enemies (dead ones, of course) and replinishing health by it and gaining more points towards the purchase of your next skill. Every skill tree has a speciality and any skill you get can drastically change the gameplay and your methods of brutally murdering bad guys, making the end game the most fun of all, as you got so many tools in your arsenal that every situation is your playground. The skills you get also scale with your own, as you learn to further multitask the demon arms while still keeping concentrated on the basic firefights and making the ultimate killing machine out of you. That's why even the hardest difficulty doesn't feel unfair in any way, but challenging and forcing you to sharpen those reflexes make use of everything you learn. It's a masterpiece to be quite honest with you. Just so you can get the idea of how deep this game can be (story-wise), before the TL;DR, I'll leave you with my favourite monologue of Jackie Estacado: ""Time slips away from you. And then, all of a sudden, it's like you're sitting in a theatre, watching a movie of your own life. You're a fu**ing movie star. And you're killing all the bad guys-tearing them limb from limb.And you feel good, you look good. F**k, you ARE good. And then you realize something: everyone else in the theatre? They're screaming, because they're watching a horror movie...and you're not the hero...you're the monster...""TL;DR: A great atmospheric game, filled with gore and overall dark themes. One of the best story-driven first person shooters out there, featuring great, complex and innovative gameplay mechanics by using the power of the darkness. A solid 10/10 in my opinion, at least for the singleplayer.			"

												The Darkness II is a fun arcade shooter with a bunch of supernatural abilities thrown into the mix. The graphics are bright and cartoonish, similar to 2K Games' more popular game Borderlands, and don't tax a modern gaming PC overmuch. Unfortunately, there is no option to disable depth of field, which is not to everyone's taste.The gameplay is varied, enabling you to deploy different tactics ranging from brutal executions using your extra demon snake arms and impaling people with thrown parking meters to channelling the darkness into your guns as you shred the enemies stunned by your swarms of demonic flies.Controls are fair, but your demon arms suffer from a complete inability to multitask, preventing you from, for example, eating the hearts of fallen enemies to regain health while simultaneously holding a makeshift javelin or a shield at the ready, because such petty concerns are beneath your right hand, which is only used for striking. The game also assumes that if you have a gamepad connected to your PC, you will only be using it, refusing to stop vibrating it and displaying gamepad-centric button prompts even if you play the game using the keyboard and mouse exclusively, so be prepared to have to unplug or disable your gamepad if you prefer keyboard and mouse.The story is a little on the short side, but the co-op enabled side missions called ""Vendettas"" make up for it. The world is well-designed and some of the dialogue is very funny if you take the time to listen to it. The game gives you the ability to skip most cutscenes and dialogue, enabling you to replay the campaign without having to wait for things you have already seen.As for bugs, there is a couple annoying ones: turning vertical sync on will sometimes cause the screen to blur for long periods of time, while turning it off will prevent you from moving through a few tight spaces. If you're affected by either bug, toggle vertical sync on or off.Given that the game often goes on very deep sales (85% off), there's little reason not to buy it if you enjoy FPS games.			"

												An excellent game with fantastic storytelling, worthwhile dialogue, exceptional voice acting and top-notch gameplay. I've yet to finish it, but I'm thoroughly enjoying my second playthrough from the beginning. It feels even better with a gamepad too, as it feels like a more natural way to control the Darkness powers, rather than a mouse and keyboard. Overall, excellent story and characters and visceral gameplay that revels in its absurd levels of violence. The first time you impale an enemy with a pipe, or slice them with a car door, if you don't giggle with glee, you just might be a robot. ;)			"

Darkness 2 is without a doubt one of the best shooters from 2012.Why ? It's unique, fresh, fun, beautiful and content packed. It has two separate campaigns, hit list missions, 5 playable characters etc etc...Single-player: You play as Jackie Estacado, head of the Franchetti crime family. You ""wield"" the Darkness. Darkness allows you to slash, grab, throw and execute enemies. It also allows you to grab different objects and throw them at your enemies.Jackie has 5 different skill trees that allow you to unlock and acquire new executions, abilities/skills and upgrades.You can also dual wield different types of weapons. An example: You can carry and fire a Desert Eagle and an MP7 at the same time - Darkness 2 gives the word ""badass"" a whole new meaning.Everything you see can be used as a weapon tho. Just grab a pipe and throw it at your enemies!The single-player campaign is only 5-6 hours long (don't worry, there is enough content in the game) but that's a good thing. It doesn't drag it out. The story is great and it never gets boring. A lot of games make the mistake of dragging the game out just to try to be a bit longer. Not this one! You're always focused on the main goal and the story is addictive and interesting. There's also New Game+ that allows you to play through the game while keeping all your unlocked abilities. A good way to unlock all five skilltrees.Co-op: Co-op adds another 2-3 hours long campaign (1-4 players, can also be played and finished alone in offline mode), 6 solo and 2-player ""Hit List"" missions and 4 new characters: Shoshanna, Inugami, JP DuMond and Jimmy Wilson.Each character has different and unique special weapons, one-liners, executions and 3 different skill trees - you can tell that developers put a lot of time and hard work into making these characters...into making this game!Shoshanna wields a super-shotgun that never misses. Inugami carries a katana with him (felt like playing Shadow Warrior), Jimmy has an axe and JP carries a magical staff that lets him lift enemies. Each also has 3 different skill trees, executions and one-liners.Yes, there are one-liners in this game! The single-player campaign is rather dark and serious but the co-op campaign takes itself a lot less seriously. It's a bit silly, funny and with all these one-liners it feels like playing Duke or Shadow Warrior! It's a lot of fun!The gameplay is unique and makes this game stand out from the others. It has an awesome story, an interesting setting, a great artstyle and the graphics are quite good aswell. It has a lot of content and in my opinion it's well worth the full price.8/10 - A must have for all FPS fans! Especially if you can get a friend to buy and play the co-op with you. "

												The gameplay on The Darkness is pretty good. It's fast paced and the ""4 arms"" gimmick will feel confusing at first, but it'll grow on you as you start ripping people apart (the game is pretty graphical that way) and getting new powers with the skill system.The story is pretty good and moves at a nice pace, but then again, the game is easily finished in about 5 hours, wich is pretty bloody short, even by ""modern"" FPS standarts... However it does offer a New Game+ option, witch is always nice. You get to keep all the collectibles you found and skills you purchased so that your second time arround is even bloodier and more violent (if something like that is possible). However, the original ending was a bit of a dissapointment, so here's hoping for an alternate ending on NG+!Also, the characters are pretty well presented, especially the Darkling, who helps us during most of the game and serves as a comical relief.In addition to the single player campaign, there is a co-op campaign with 4 different characters, all with a specific set of skills and limited use of weapons and the Darkness (you know, those 2 devilish arms). It sounds good enough, but it actually takes away the biggest part of the gameplay that makes it great: the ""quad-wield""... and of course, the story. Still, any co-op mode has potential for fun!I'd recommend this on sale or included in a bundle (like the current 2K one, go check it out, for 1$ you get this, Bioshock and The Bureau), since for 30€ you won't get your moneys worth in terms of lenght...

												**UPDATE** Still THE BEST Story game I have ever played. I literally recommend it to everyone that is wanting a story game. After getting 100% on it, I should probably make a review of it. The Darkness 2 is an extremely violent FPS with a storyline that twists and turns and gives you even more addiction at the end game. This is one of the better storylines that I have ever played and it gives you all the feels in all the right ways. You get joy, revenge, sadness, vengance, longing, and all those other characteristics to be able to relate with everyone in the game. The Darkness was an interesting concept because it isn't a voice that is just narrating you or such. It is a part of you and influences you. It doesn't tell you to go here or there, it screams at you that your will obey it and it taunts you with a lost soul it controls. The boss fights in the game are pretty solid, the bosses have enough mobility to where you can't just stand there and shoot at them in one direction. They move a lot and most of the time you have to be moving as well. The light concept is very well done and brings more aspects of thinking ahead and getting priorities out (especially in the harder difficulties). If you are under a light source your screen goes white where you can barely see and being in the light removes your powers and any buffs that you have acquired that only apply when you are in the dark. So when a van comes crushing through towards you, you should probably shoot out the headlights first before trying to fend off the enemies. The execution moves are super brutal. There are 4 different executions that you can do and each results in a different buff and also a different execution style. You can either use the execution to restore health, restore ammo, gain a demonic riot shield, or shorten you skills timers. Each I believe have 3 different executions resulting in 12 total executions which all have their own amount of brutality for anyone to enjoy. There is enough of a talent tree to make you play more than one run through and probably just move on to Don difficulty at that point. You can do New Game+ to keep all your talents and such, which makes a considerable amount of Don difficulty pretty easy, but bosses still can be hard to beat. I know that some people didn't really like the graphics of the game, but I believe they probably made them that way because of the Borderlands series, both are made by 2K games, so I think that is what they did, but in my own opinion I love the graphics as do I love Borderlands, so it was enjoyable for me. The NPCs in the game all have a certain human flair to them where they aren't just NPCs, you can relate to them easily and they become much more than just NPCs. You collect relics throughout the game that will give you essence (which is gained by killing people, getting relics, and is used to buy talents) and they aren't that hard to find. Some are easy to miss but generally you won't have problems finding them. The weapon selection through the game is pretty small, but they made it for a good reason. There aren't any snipers or rocket launchers or big weapons like that, no grenades either (unless you count throwing propane tanks XD ). with the smaller weapons, you can either weild one at a time, or dual weild. The choices are for single shots: Desert Eagle, Cobra, and M9. The choices are for automatics: UMP5, MP7, and Micro UZI. The choices are for the main weapon: Carbine (M16 Burst Fire), AK47, Sawed Off Shotgun, Model 1887 (?), and a Stiker. The powers you have through the game is also limited, but they are super powerful so it doesn't really matter at that point honestly. You have two activated abilities, The Swarm and Gun Channeling. The Swarm goes out and swarms around people effectively stunning them (and sometimes even killing them), you can get upgrades for it to last longer, recharge faster and affect more enemies. Gun Channgeling gives you infinite ammo and super powered shots for a limited time. The upgrades consits of longer lasting, faster recharge, auto shooting towards targets and shooting through walls. So as you can tell, turning a corridor full of enemies you can just activate both and blow through them both in two seconds. I didn't really find any bugs in the game. The only real problem I had is that sometimes the screen goes a little blurry, like the beginning of being of barely stepping in light and it just causes some depth of view problems. It doesn't really last long if it happens, but it can and when you are trying to fight people it messes with your vision a bit. So all in all to say: 10/10 hands down. Would love to have harder achievements though.			"

												★★★★☆ - ""Worth your time, give it a bash"" PROS:- An unexpectedly gripping storyline.- The gameplay is just awesome, fast paced, varied and satisfying. The absolute core to the game.- Blood, guts and gore galore.- Upgrading options are pretty good, along with the weapon standards it allows fresh new ways to unleash the    darkness.- Co-op mode, the vendetta mode is short and wave-like but its there and lengthens the game.- Two endings.- The difficulty is just right, played on normal but it was challenging in places.CONS:- The conclusion to the game could have been better.- I wish there were more weapons but having the darkness means this isnt a big deal.- Voice acting is a little daft here and there.- The boss battles arent the best.VERDICT? I really didnt expect to enjoy this game as much as I did.			"

												The Darkness II:This is the second Steam account that I have owned The Darkness II on so before you look at my time played and say ""You haven't played through it"", I have. I've played through the entire game multiple times.First and foremost, this is the most underrated game on Steam. That's why I voted for The Darkness II for the ""I Thought This Game was Cool Before it Won an Award"" award.One major complaint that I have about The Darkness II is how short its campaign is. It's not difficult to beat it in around six hours. That might sound a little disappointing compared to its predecessor's much longer runtime, it's really not that bad. If you were to cut out the first game's mundane side missions and mindless wandering around the labyrinthine city and the subway tunnels below it, both games would be about the same length. I don't know about you, but I'd much rather have six incredible hours of gameplay than twelve mediocre hours with a few good parts thrown in.There are four characters you can choose from, and their unique skill trees and Darkness weapons make each of them worth checking out. There's Inugami, a swordsman who has to kill to satiate his cursed katana lest it take his soul; a Scotsman named Jimmy Wilson, who has a love for the drink and a fondness for splitting skulls with an axe; a voodoo shaman named JP Dummond, who wields a powerful staff; and Shoshanna, who gets up close and personal with her double-barrel shotgun. None of them are particularly relatable characters, but they're all solid, and their unique weapons and skill sets offer some incentive to play through Vendettas more than once. That's a good thing though because the mode only takes a few hours to complete.The Darkness II is everything I wanted a sequel to The Darkness to be. It's almost excessive in its violence, the combat is addicting, the hand-drawn Graphic Noir art style is gorgeous, and underneath it all is a game with a heart and a truly interesting story. Jackie's a supremely messed-up individual, but I still love him because of all the stuff he's willing to go through in order to save Jenny. If you're looking for any of these things, The Darkness II won't disappoint.			"

Not as good as the first installment...but despite that, it still rocks - The only one disappointing thing are the Darkness repetitive executions, which really start to annoy you after several times, nevertheless I love the gore in games ~ I'm still quite unsure about the visuals and setting, because I really loved the dark and depressing atmosphere of the original game. But the comics-like graphics feels... well, okayThe other parts of the game are decent and wunderbar + The story is very well written with several interesting twists and minimum amount of cliches I didn't even pay attention to during gameplay.The ending is brilliant and might break even the heart of rock and steel into small shards + The romantic part of the game is well organized: it doesn't make you sick and fits in the story quite well + The FPS and action mechanics are great with akimbo weapons literally dancing in your hands and slashing through piles of enemies + All the characters are charismatic as hell: Jackie Estacado himself, members of his mafia clan and family, enemy mobsters, demon sidekick, the madguy and of course, the voice of the devilish symbiotic coreI'd actually love to see the remastered version of the first game for the PC, but looks like it'll never happenOverall: 8/10, highly recommendedEMBRACE THE DARKNESS, JACKIE "

												The Darkness 2 is a First Person Shooter which is based on a comic book series with the similar name. In the story campaign you play as Jackie Estacado, an italian mob boss with supernatural power based on darkness. This game has a comic book feel and look to it in term of aesthetic. There are also a decent amount of weapons and abilities that you could use to mow your way through enemies. The combat feels really fun as you mix both gunplay and supernatural powers to slay your enemy, although your abilities would be disabled in the presence of light! Abilities can also be upgraded from a skill tree through points gained from killing enemies. there are also several collectables hidden in this game that you could find and they would provide some backstory to the game.In Vendetta mode, which is basically the co-op component of the game you could play between 4 different characters which has their own unique personality, weapon and abilities. They have their own unique dialogue in each different mission and would have banter with other characters if they are there. They also have their own skill tree which you can upgrade through points gained from killing enemies.However, this game does have a weird bug regarding V-Sync. Apparently if you were to turn off v-sync, you would be stuck in vents for some reason and this would prevent progression. Turning on v-sync would fix the issue.Overall, this is a pretty decent game and still looks pretty good at the time of this review, however you would most likely be playing vendetta mode alone unless you got friends as there are almost nobody available in the matchmaking since this is a pretty old game. I would give this game a 7/10.			"

In this game no matter what ending you choose, I seelct second ending, it's give achievement and little more story & gameplay (I played 7.4 hours).Price: I think 29,99€ for this short game to much...

												There's no tedious slow moving ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in this game, only heart-pounding nonstop visceral violent mega death action.There isn't a chest high wall or sticky crate to hide behind in sight. You'll get shot to pieces but your tentacles will consume the hearts of your enemies, fueling your rampage! Good thing the game takes place (mostly) at night, because even a small flashlight makes the protag go blind, cutting his power in half and filling the screen with filter effects and tinnitus similar to being near dead in every other fps. These effects can strike you even at max hp, so it took some getting used to the thought of not retreating necessarily once you go blind.If you're itching for some fps action without the clutter of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t sandbox then this is the game for you.

Though to be fair you need not have played it to at least have a basic understanding of what is happening. You play as Jackie Estacado who has become the don of the Franchetti crime family. Reluctant to use his powers granted to him by the Darkness lest they influence him too greatly; In the events occurring in the introduction he is forced to embrace them once again. The Darkness gives Jackie demonic powers in that from a gameplay perspective results in more or less having two extra arms. However the extra arms are more like demonic snakes than regular human arms. You can duel wield rifles, grab and slash with your tentacles; throw piping and impale people into walls. Rip car doors off and use them as a shield; before it gives out in usefulness whip it at someone and slice them in half. Basically anything you want or feel like you should be able to do as a character with ostensibly four arms, you can. And it all feels really good and smooth. The guns feel powerful and so do the arms. The animations are extremely gore-filled. With help from the leveling tree you can earn health regen and ammo recoup from specific animations as well as more basic things like faster reload or increased ammo capacity. Feeding the darkness the hearts of falling enemies doesn't really get old. Aesthetically, the game is rather pleasing, featuring a cel shaded/comic book representation of its visual assets. The single player Campaign is rather short (around 5 hours) but it doesn't over stay it's welcome. The game also has some co-op missions in the form of Vendetta missions. These can be played solo or up to four players. Honestly, it has a little bit of a Left 4 Dead vibe to it. Sort of arena with some traditional level design for preamble. There are characters to play as rather than classes. Notably, the one that stood out to me was the shaman. Voiced by none other than Dave Fennoy, though I think he sounded a bit like the character Lee from TellTales The Walking Dead which I believe to be the closet to his real voice (turns out, he is like Nolan North, Tara Strong, Troy Baker level amount of prominence, I had no idea.) The actor who does the voice of the darkness is also extremely talented; Mike Patton, an in-studio example of his voice can be seen/heard here. These phenomenal voice actors make the story telling that much better. THE GISTReally fluid, dynamic and fun shooter with a story and visual art style that will keep you interested throughout.Follow my curation for more "

												If you've played the first game, you'll know that you're going to be running around with the powers of The Darkness before long, and you're going to feel like a complete badass. In this game, however, you have all of your powers from the start, and so if you're on the easiest level or the hardest, you're going to tear every enemy apart with ease. Rarely did I actually use my guns, opting more to rip my enemies to pieces with all of the combo kills. The story is very twisted here, and by the end of the game, you start questioning the game's reality, debating which portion of the game is real and which is the illusion. I highly recommend this, and if you can get a friend or two to play with you, the co-op even continues the story as a side note, letting you see what happens with your crew when you're not around to tie up all the loose ends. It's on sale for 80% off this weekend-- letting a $30 game go when it's $6 would be a shame.If you want a taste of the awesomeness, try the demo-- it's available for download from this page.			"

Fine-ish Game with nice story and combat mechanic BUT it's very short I finished it 5-6 hours in hardest difficulty.StoryPlaying as Mafia Boss Jackie Estacado, you got hit from another gang in your restaurant and you killing the attackers to find out about it.GameplayThe combat in this game is different than other game you wield the Darkenss in you that give you powers. Quad Wielding weapon in each hand and you got Demon arms the you can smash enemies and interact with the environment with it, the first game I saw that have this feature.IssuesHad problem in the game is get blurry time to time no fix for the problem you need to take steam screenshot to make the blur go away.I would recommend buying the game in sales quite cheap.

												The Darkness 2 continua a história do Jack Estacado, um chefe da máfia que possui poderes sobrenaturais, graças à entidade denomidada ''The Darkness''! História: Para quem jogou o primeiro jogo, provavelmente vai ser um festival de nostalgia, ainda mais porque ele foi um dos primeiros da ''next-gen'' passada (Xbox 360 e PS3). No segundo game, que se passa dois anos após o primeiro, você deverá salvar a alma de Jenny (SPOILERS!!!!! Sua ex-namorada falecida, que morreu no primeiro game).Gameplay: O game volta com o sistema muito parecido do anterior, usando pistolas, 12s e metralhadoras para devastar os seus inimigos. Ele também usa os poderes do The Darkness, que seriam aquelas duas serpentes devoradoras de corações, que ficam acima de seu ombro. Gráficos: O jogo está muito bonito, apesar do uso de cell-shading, que seria aquele mesmo motor gráfico do Borderlands, que geralmente não agrada muito. O design artístico do  game está excelente, valorizando a sua parte de revista em quadrinhos, já que o game foi inspirado no comic book ''The Darkness''.Conclusão: The Darkness 2 é um game que faz jus ao seu antecessor, deixando a história um pouquinho de lado e focando mais no gameplay. Mas, o primeiro, na minha opinião, ainda é melhor! Nota: 8.0!			"

												It's first-person shooter with RPG elements, where the only things you are going to do are shooting, slashing and tearing enemies apart with your guns and demonic arms. Story is short and predictable, but gameplay is addictive. I personally liked dark comic-style graphics. Good game to spent an evening or two. Recommended.			"

												Probably the most brutal FPS with RPG elements that I have played, and one that does not go too overboard with the rediculousness.  The amount of gruesome finishing moves with your demon tentacle-things are great fun, and keeps every fight engaging.			"

												Love story written in blood. Spiced up by powers of Darkness, flying bodies, torn corpses, severed limbs and tasty headshots. Great voice acting (all chars, but the main hero [Brian Bloom] and Darkness [Mike Patton] especially. The last scream of the main character is so freaking real.), excellent music (listen to it for a while) and graphical style. Graphics and sounds are nice as well. Gameplay - well... no sane person wants to be your enemy - quad wielding allows for 2 weapons and 2 hellish tentacles to massacre the enemies. You plow through the bad guys. Wiping out baddies is very satysfying. SP story is good (it is weird as well at times, but in a good way). There are few ""WTF"" moments. There are some emotional moments which I found to fit the atmosphere perfectly and I loved them in game. They did not feel out of place for sure.Coop is great - 18 missions for max 4 players. There are 4 different chars, each with his/her own skills and weapons. Coop takes place in paralell to story which is nice since they overlap in events. I sank in this game. I played and maxed every character I could. Gamplay is fluent and very satysfying. Underrated and underestimated game. Shame. Definitely worth attention! I just wish the first game made it to PC - it did not and it never will, so enjoy this one.PC port and performance are solid. FOV slider is in the game :D. Too bad ini files are encrypted as it limits tweaking because Unreal Engine 3 is pretty flexible. Get.This.Game!			"

												Gameplay:Pros--Gunplay is tight and satisfying. -The ability to dual weild and use your darkness powers keep the combat fresh and interesting.-Skill tree is well developed, offering interesting character upgrades that spice up combat.-Boss fights are well implemented into the game. Never overstaying their welcome and changing up the pace.-Light is used as an interesting mechanic.-Some of the best collectibles in gaming.Cons--Few enemy varities make combat feel repetetive at times.-Very linear with little room for exploration.Score - 8/10Graphics:Pros- -Cell shaded visuals harken back to the comic book roots of the franchise.-Colors make the game feel vibrant and alive, while retaining it's dark and opressive atmosphere.-Lighting is exceptional, fitting the graphical style perfectly.-Well varied environments.-Animations are incredibly gruesome.Cons--Lip syncing is off at times.Summary - 9/10Story-Pros--Extremely well paced and engaging narrative.-Well written dialogue.-Characters are fleshed out and likable.-Isn't overwhelming for newcomers to the franchise.-Great voice acting.Cons--Underdeveloped villain-It's quite short. (Beat the game in 8 hours on the second hardest difficulty)-Sequal bait ending that leaves much to be desired.Summary - 7/10Overall-Whilest the game's length and ending hold it back from greatness, it's still a solid experience that should be on the radar of every FPS fan.Total Score - 24/30 "

												NOTE: I have not played The Darkness 1. So my review can't compare the two games, I have however read the comic and know what happens, so my knowledge of the story is pretty decent.A fan of The Darkness comic book, I picked up this game a while ago in a humble bundle, and really just didn't like the idea of having the demon arms and everything in the game. In fact, I would have ended up never playing it if I hadn't felt a commitment to the comics.I decided to just play a single level this morning and actually found it fairly boring at first. The gameplay just seemed to be far too easy and the storyline was not what I had hoped for considering the excellent comic it was based on. I decided to play another level just to see if the game would pick up.I ended up completing the game without stopping. It's amazing.The gameplay works far better than I imagined. The demon arms are not tedious to use, and are not as overpowered as I felt they were in the first mission. Even without the demon arms, this would be a pretty solid FPS. However these of course add a unique twist on the game to seperate it from the countless other first person shooters available right now.The storyline is fantastic for a AAA game. (I don't know if its a ''AAA'' game as it's release wasnt absolutely huge...Let's call it a ''AA''.)If I am completely honest, the gameplay does get slightly repetitive. However this combined with the other flaw which is that the game is far too short, mean that you don't get bored of the game that easily as it's finished before you can get tiresome.I don't feel like there's much replay value here unfortunately.Final Verdict:+Fantastic storyline.+Entertaining gameplay+Interesting use of demonic powers at the same time as guns. Something completely refreshing.- Game is far too short-Can become slightly repetitive towards the end. (However storyline gets more intense towards the end so you don't notice this so much.)8/10			"

												Played this recently and while I can't speak for multiplayer, the campaign was great although short. I only found two bugs while playing. One where you have to turn v sync on to get through a vent section, and another where I would attack with the darkness and have a blurry vision unless I restarted my checkpoint (only happened during the attack on mansion mission.While the darkness 2 is shorter and more linear than the darkness 1, it's still a fun and good game overall. Would recommend especially when on sale			"

												Another great game, with twisted Gameplay.In the name of Darkness you kill people with your tentacles, slicing people into pieces and ripping them apart.The Storyline is a nice one, but if it bores you, then you can simply skip the cinametics and conversations. Always a great future that not every game has.Had allot of fun playing it, but I did find the campaign short ( lasted only 5 hours ).Good thing they got Vendetta mode which adds what I was looking for those missions are great.My favorite moments is actually when you get to play as the lil demon monkey.Can't wait ( hopefully ) for Darkness III			"

												One of the best modern FPS I've played . Characters are well thought out & relationships are warm, story is good, game looks nice (suits it's comic book origin), gameplay is smooth & fun, music is servicable, & it has a nice sense of humour. Special attacks & Death animations are satisfying and short enough to never get boring. Your AI partner is useful & charming, urinating & farting on enemy corpses in a hilarious fashion. Also, great details such as reports on the radios regarding your last murder spree, and some optional dialouges & mini games scattered around the game adds more depth as well as change things up a bit.Negatives for me involved* the comparatively SUPER LOUD logo section which starts off the game. Watch your ear drums! * The ""stuck in vents""-bug, which was solved by enabling v-synch in the menu, for some reason. If anyone can explain in simpel terms how that works, please do so! I can't understand how something like vertical synch would make your character be able to walk across inviseable walls?* The really annoying ""blurred vision"" bug, which is solved by taking screen shots. It occured more frequently for me as the game went along. Perhaps the more enemies on screen the worse the blur got? It shouldn't really be a problem for me with the specs of my PC, but there you go.* The ""never stops firing"" bug, which is solved by switching weapon.* The ""thump sound bug"" which doesn't affect anything really except for inducing mild annoyance in the gamer, just a weird noise that keeps repeating itself a bit moment after certain actions.Exra bonus for having several different female character models; slim, fat, ""normal"", older, younger etc, and not sexualising the main love interest but staying respectfully true of the protaganists own feelings for her. She was shown in casual clothes in the majority fo the game, plain in appearance but heavily emphasized to be a caring and fun loving individual. Though many of your companions are sexist♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you are not, and you get the feeling the game aims to portrait sexism & ""masculine"" violence as a bad thing, and respect as a good one. Especially in how the game depicts a brothel, which is one of the saddest & most thought provoking enviroments I've come across in gaming.Some have complained about the game being too short in lenght, but I thought it was just right, especially for a follow up second playhtrough in game mode + (being able to keep your xp and collectibles). I tend to get too stressed about longer games to even play them to begin with, so this was just perfect in my opinion.Seeing as this game is at the publication of this review 4, almost 5, years old, it is most definetly worth it's price on sale if nothing else.

												The Darkness 2 is fun, brutal, and stays quite faithul to it's source material, in terms of both its story and its visual presentation. It offers a multitude of ways to brutally murder your opponents- if its guns are not enough for you, you'll find much to do with the Darkness' serpents, whipping, slashing, eviscerating your foes. So, if the gunplay is good, the melee is good, the story is good, what's the catch?Well, the catch is, there's not much of it.I completed this game, from blood soaked beginning to somber end, in five hours. Now, it is true that the New Game + adds a touch more length to the game, and the four player cooperative mode fills in the gaps in between the main story, but, again, there's just not that much of it to go around! So, would I purchase this game at thirty dollars, which is the standard asking price? No. I mean, I kind of already did, but as warning to any of you who are new to the series, unless you've got thirty bucks you're in desperate need of not spending on possible bundles of longer, cheaper titles with more replayability, no.But if you're reading this during a sale, this game is worth every last penny as long as you have a buddy to share the ride with- it's phenomenal on the whole, and I wish they would either make a sequel or port the first game to PC.

												In Darkness you play as a Mob guy with a dark power of having these tentacle things.  Its strange at first but thanks to the great controls is easy to adapt to.  Some of the best voice acting and character design in video game history with an awesome story to boot.  Game takes you all over in its level design from Posh Nightclubs to hell, and there is a ride in the amusement park that takes you through a haunted house.  The game uses a cell shaded art style like Borderlands but much better than even Borderlands 2 which is weird because this is much older but looks ten times better.Tons of replay value to go relic hunting with New Game+ so the ride never ends.  The game is old but TONS of people still play the coop multiplayer, most other games even new ones are dead at launch like that Tomb Raider reboot, but forever later and this game is still goin strong so bust it out of the back catalog.**If you get stuck in the vent as the Darkling, enable vsync and it should let you move on.Great game during October so get into the halloween spirit getting spooked with Darkness 2!

												Finally i finished this game just now, its kinda short, fortunately there are new game plus mode and co-op up to 4 players if you want to complete the achievements.This game tells a story about a demon-infested mobster Jackie Estacado, who being attacked by a group called Brotherhood who want to take The Darkness (the demon inside Jackie's body). First time i see Jackie, its kinda remind me of Tian, a character from manhua Feng Shen ji, cause Tian have 2 dragons on his back, just like Jackie does.And this Darkness thing is a badass, its really fun playing with it, we are not just shoot the enemies with guns but it can allow you to perform variety of gruesome executions (its really gore, decapitate and dismember the enemies) with things surround us like poles, car doors, even trash bin. lolWe can upgrade the darkness for several power up like black holes, more health, extra ammo, shield, flies swarm etc. yeah its kinda overpowered when we have several extra limbs to fight with enemies but it still has a weakness, light, when we covered with light the darkness will dissapear immediately.One thing that keep me playing is the story, the story make you keep curious and interested, the loss of jenny (jackie's girlfriend), his father and the struggle to control the darkness it the main plot in this game. the moment i loved the most when we are at asylum and they said Jackie are sick and delusional, with all characters at the asylum with their roles and several clues like The Darkness comics book, picture on the wall, its make you really think which one is the reality, is Jackie made things up? is he really a patient or a leader of a mobster?, is the darkness really exist? its make me play this game till finished it.Overall this game is good, not so special but if you like something dark, violent, brutal, gore and fleshy, this FPS is worth your time, probably wait for some discount. 7/10.

There are a few glitches but you can avoid almost 99% of them by keeping vsync ON. (aka game is unstable above 60.)If the games on sale or something I reccomend buying it. Other than that I'd hold off until it is onsale. It's definetly not worth 29.99. I bought for 5.09 from halloween sale.			"

												While I never played the first ""The Darkness"" (I haven't owned a console for two gens now) I played the demo for The Darkness II and was very impressed by the art style and the beautiful gore.The game places you in the boots of Jackie Estacado, the current head of the Italian mafia who happens to be in possession of ""The Darkness"" which he has to keep at bay. Needless to say shortly after the game starts Jackie IS forced to call upon the powers of The Darkness  to save himself and wreck havoc on those who wronged him. Where this game excels is in combat. In addition to the usual range of guns you have The Darkness on your side: two gross tentacles that grow out of your back (or shoulders, it's hard to tell). This adds a great layer of depth to an otherwise very good first person shooter. Gun mechanics are great if a little arcade-y. Having the tentacles on your side means you have access to far reaching melee attacks that dispatch enemies in a gloriously gruesome fashion (note, if you are squeamish, stay away, this game is very VERY gruesome. I'm talking people being torn in half, split in half, ripped in half, disemboweled, etc.).Outside of the combat is some truly great storytelling that utilizes the ""unreliable narrator"" mechanic I learned about in English class VERY well. I won't spoil anything but you will be guessing probably right up until the end as to what is really going on in the story. The voice acting is great (as long as you don't hate Italian-American accents) and the dialogue is very well written. I found myself very surprised at the overall production value and quality that the game reeked of.In regards to achievements, this one was pretty easy. There were some in there that were fun to try and tackle and provided satisfaction but it's mostly story mode on different difficulties and collectibles plus a few ""do this a certain way"" (which are the ones I dig). I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good FPS with a great story (even if it is linear). It's not too long of a game but I would consider it just the right length considering what you get. For achievement hunters I say go for it. It wasn't too tricky to 100% and nothing stands out in my memory as something that was broken or near-impossible.Overall, if you're a fan of First-Person Shooter games you can't go wrong with this title. You can usually get it cheap these days and there's no DLC to worry about buying to complete it. Highly recommended.8/10			"

												Note: to see this review with pictures,etc go to: {LINK REMOVED}http://tinyurl.com/TheDarknessGeekofwildoowd-comThe Darkness 2, is a Canadian developed first-person shooter psychological horror game by Digital Extremes and published by 2K GamesIn the Darkness 2 Jackie Estacado - the players character, has taken over one of New Yorks biggest Gang/Mob. still suffering from regret over his girlfriends death, Jackie is trying to live a normal life. having learned how to control and repress The Darkness. but he is forced to unleash The Darkness after a strange cult attacks him and his friends.To be honest,The Darkness 2 is petty cliche, Guy loves girl, girl gets killed, guy has flash backs of said dead gril, on and on, you get the point. the levels aren't breathtaking, or special. no, in fact most of it is a hallway shooter and it really never breaks that form. despite all this the game is still fun. and the reason is of The Darkness. you get to use this special power and its pretty fun to take out enemy with it.but you will soon tire of seeing the same kill moves over and over and over. sure, the first time or so its pretty cool to watch, but by the 30th or 40th time of seen the same kill moves you'll get bored. still, later on in the Darkness 2, the story does get better, and it will sometimes have you wondering what is real and what is not.alas, the world of The Darkness 2 is boring and dry. almost all of the gameplay takes place in dark alleys/buildings that are extremely generic. and just to be more cliche The Darkness 2 features a abandoned fair/circus.in the end The Darkness 2 is nothing special, but it is fun the first few times you play it. even the gameplay suffers though. as on normal the game is only four hours. The Darkness 2 has a multiplayer mode, however its boring and dull. the Darkness is worth 15$ max and you will have some fun with it. but once you get done with the story you will probably never play it again.

-Quick Review-The Darkness II is a FPS with a lot of unique mechanics that I've only experienced for the first time in playing a game  with this  genre (grabbing stuff with tentacles, using them to heal yourself, I can hear a bad hentai joke coming...)


YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: The Darkness II 

			Views: 143		

			The Darkness 2 is a FPS story driven game available here: Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/67370/ HomePage: http://www.embracethedarkness.com/us/ The Song during the Story section of The...		

-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  You play the game as Jackie, a gruff, angry, imposing man whom has a dark power that he inherited from his father. Tormented by his memory of his girl friend Jenny he struggles to try to get revenge for an attempt on his life.I found it amusing that the game basically makes Jackie a crime boss, it game the game and the story an interesting tone. And the game carried it very well. The story was extremely well executed down to the very end of the game. I don't want to give anymore away, I will say that the game lets you select an introduction that explains what happened in the first Darkness game, if you (like me) never played the first game.Game Play: while I was playing I was confused at the key mapping from the start of the game, but I picked up on the controls really quickly, like I've said I've only played the easiest difficulty so I just hack and slashed my way through the whole game and didn't die once.There are a few main combat mechanics: 1) you use guns. Hence why I categorize it as a FPS 2) You have two shadow arms that wreak havoc with basic swing attacks 3) your shadow arms can grab and throw objects 4) your arms can grab other humans and mutilate them to gain ammo, health, amusement, etc.By combining these various moves and abilities you can create some really awesome combination attacks. If you're aware of your surroundings and have good reflexes the game is really fun to play. I get tired of playing the same type of game over and over, but this game takes a great spin on traditional FPS's and gives it interesting mechanics to make the game just that much more interesting and engaging.One more note on game play: Progression. I find that just killing hundreds of npc's for the sake of killing npc's isn't very interesting *cough cough* Brutal Legend *cough cough*. Anyway, the game has a level system that you can spent points to get new abilities, making that mass slaughter I had, actually have a purpose. Achievements: As usual this game has the standard ""you beat the game"" achievements. The ""beat the game on this difficulty"" achievements. there are also a few multiplayer achievements (which I haven't worked on yet), And then there are the ""do this special thing in the game"".The achievements seem straightforward. But I haven't earned them all yet (08/09/14) so I don't know if there are any really note worthy achievements at this time. but so far the achievements look very straightforward.Price: The Darkness II is $29.99, at this time I've only put 5 hours into the game, but I can see myself  playing this game for about 10-20 hours. I really enjoyed the game, but I don't know how high the replay value is for someone whom isn't going for achievements.I really enjoyed the story, and don't have anything really negative to say about the game (other than at time the gore was a bit much, but that won't bother most people), as I usually say at this point, is that I'd recommend getting this game in a Humble Bundle or waiting for it to go on sale. I personally purchased mine in a Humble Bundle.  Conclusion: to recap,  the story was excellent, the game play was engaging and interesting, the achievements were alright, the price was kind of high but the quality in the game was good. I recommend this game to anyone who knows they know FPS's, don't mind gore, like a bit of a darker story (pun not intended), and likes a good story.Edit/Update 08/16/14I have a few things to add about the game. I've all but earned all the achievements on this game. So in a way I've given a bit of a preview of how much work it takes to get the various achievements. The game has actually gotten better.I played through the Vendetta's, which is a multi-player element to the game. But you also have the option of solo-playing through the whole thing. You have access two 4 new characters that run a ""side quest line"" parallel to what is happening to Jackie in the main story. This element gives the game more replay-quality, which for me is great! I love continuing to work through a game after I've beaten it, and have a different experience.A quick updated note about the achievements: Most of the achievements aren't very difficult, but actually require you to try out different things in the game. I didn't find myself particularly frustrated with any of them. This game actually had an almost-perfect balance in their achievements for my tastes.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update October 29, 2016:Added the video review from my YouTube Channel.			"

Unleash the darkness and kill your foes with tentacles... Hm, kinky.The Darkness II is a 3rd person shooter based on the comics from the 90ties. You play as Jack Estacado, a mafia chief who is possessed by an entity known as ""The Darkness"", which gives you super powers but makes you follow its will.GameplayAs a single player FPS you will be shooting hordes of enemies with your guns. You got many guns such as shotguns, assault rifles, pistols, revolvers... You also got a pair of demoniac tentacles that can slice enemies and do crazy stuff, like throwing objects and performing some ""fatalities"" on the enemies. You dont have regenerative health or medickits, to restore health you need to use your tentacles to literaly eat the heart of dead enemies. Also to recover ammo just grab the gun of a dead enemy. Gameplay is blazing fast: you will be surrounded by enemies and will start shooting like crazy and chopping them off with you tentacles. Game is very gory and violent, not recommended for the faint of heart...StoryTrying to avoid spoilers here. Basically you have some evil guys who want to take the ""Darkness"" from you and use it for their own evil pourposes. The Darkness wants to overcome the threat and uses the souls of your dead girlfriend Jenny as a way to persuade you into obeying it. The story is really well constructed and has some good plot twists near the end. I mean, the game gives you a lot more than just enemies to shoot, it gives a good and and entertaining dark comic book time.I Rate it 3.8/5.0, its good, but kinda repetitive with the infinite hordes of the same mobs you fight over and over...

With a more of a comic book style graphics then the first game Darkness II was given even more freedom to realize its potential.  Demon heads, an imp-like companion, and powers of darkness you will fight for your mafia families honor.   I only wish the first game was also ported to PC.  10/10			"

												Надо сказать, что я не рассчитывал, что игра так поглотит меня, думал что это очередное♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ выпущенное студией-однодневкой.Сразу понравилась озвучка и краткая история первой части. Графика сначала малость напрягала, затем, маленько поиграв привык к ней и уже не обращал на нее внимания.Игровой процесс интересен, но однообразен и когда тебе уже начинает надоедать убивать очередного врага, включаются интересные сюжетные вставки. эти вставки мне напомнили фильм Проклятый остров с Ди Каприо, шикарный фильм и опять же это очень здорово смотрится в игре.Понравилась система прокачки героя, Можно прокачивать разные стороны героя, как супер-способности, таки владением оружием, Очень понравился бес, просто няшка. Озвучка опять же на высоте. кстати здорово что главный герой ""умеет разговаривать"", это помогает полностью погрузится в игру, помню как меня бесила молчаливость Артема из Метро 2033. Здесь совсем другое.игра короткая, прошел за 2 вечера, при желании можно пройти и за один. Но именно то что игра короткая, она не успевает надоесть и держит игрока в напряжение до последних минут.В общем играйте - не пожалеете. "

												Short: 8/10 Fun shooter with ~17 hours of (offline) gameplay.Long: The Darkness 2 is a first person shooter with RPG elements like a talent tree and special action skills (think Borderlands) as well as point awards for combos (think Call of Juarez). The game guides you into the sequel via short monologue, explaning the plot of the first game thus getting you right on board. Gameplay is very easy to pick up and fun throughout; utilising kill combos, dual wield gun play, special active skills or your darkness ""tentacles"". The enemies vary for about 3/4 of the game so just when you start getting a little tired of them, it's mostly over. The replay value comes via New Game+ mode as well as several online/offline co-op side missions. The side missions aren't anything special and killing the same enemies gets a bit tiresome, but the characters have their own talent trees and voice acting, which somewhat makes up for it. All in all it's a good shooter romp that has good replay value (as you can see by my 50/50 achievement score). It doesn't bring anything ground breaking into the shooter genre but it doesn't try to and knows its strong points. 8/10 for me.			"

It was enjoyable and I liked the story very much. For all german players:Kauft euch bloß nicht die geschnittene Version auf Steam. Bestellt euch über einen Online-Versandshop die österreichische Version des Spiels und ihr habt die volle Uncut-Version mit komplett deutscher Audio. Die geschnitte Version nimmt bei diesem Spiel jeglichen Spaß und Reiz.			"

The Darkness 2The Darkness II is one of the games that is not appreciated game but in in my opinion, the game is good if you are looking for game with a nice cooperative mode, interesting storyline and a good massacre if you know what I mean :D. The main character is Jackie Estacado, head of the Franchetti crime family, who must face the Brotherhood (dangerous organization) that wants to control The Darkness. In our game we will have to visit the various locations in which we will use the different kinds of weapons such as assault rifles, submachine guns, pistols but also special powers of darkness. In the game you will find many sad threading in whose Jackie has hallucinations about his girlfriend and moments in a mental hospital. The game offers us two modes: single player and multiplayer more precisely is a cooperative mode for up to 4 people. The graphics in the game is made in comic way. It is very nicely done and well optimized and a very bloody. Sounds and voice acting in the game is a really good. Shooting is very pleasant with each weapon and killing people with a demonic power is impressive. The biggest minus of this production is the length of the storyline is a really short and very easy, even on the highest difficulty level. Finish this game on Hoodium took me less than 6 hours and on the level of difficulty of Don took me 10 hours. My rating is a 8/10. I spent many happy hours with this production, ;)  "

												This game was so much fun! I went through it twice for the difficulty achievement, and the second playthrough was maybe even more enjoyable than the first, which is a rare thing for me. Did the Vendetta missions as well, the ""multiplayer"" characters are heaps of fun and have interesting personalities and things to say. The only flaw this game has, in my opinion, is that it seems to have been cut short - it won't take you too long to finish it and it ends with a cliffhanger. I think they could have completed the story in this one and not waited for the Darkness 3, which, judging by the things I've read while googling it, probably won't even get made. But really, I can't recommend this game enough to both RPG and FPS fans, as well as people who enjoy a solid story that will leave you wanting to know more about it, the world and the characters.

												This game is a well made game and I enjoyed playing it the entire game. You are playing as the boss of an Italian mafia that get special powers, powers that belong to the dark side.The gameplay and the combat is well made, the combat can be challenging some times when face a certain types of enemies - but most of the time you just having fun as playing some op character.The graphics of this game is pretty good and also unique - a nice change from other games ( the graphics are like comics, contrary to other games who try to look realistic ).The game also present a boss fights that can be challenging.In addition to all of this the powers of the darkness are very powerful and are very fun to use. Those powers can be upgraded for different uses and there also upgrade for the weapons that is used in the combat.The story himself is avarage  - some cult try to take your powers.Even though the story lacks the game is extremely fun to play and the story get a great dark aspects to it too.My Score: 8/10			"

												I nominated this game for ""I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award"" Maybe this category may need more unpopular games but I think it deserves to be here. Even though the publisher of this game is very famous, few people know about this game. I don't understand why it is underrated.I haven't read The Darkness comic book series but I think it is a great adaptation. The graphichs give the taste of comic books very well. Combination of guns and special powers give you a comfortable and an enjoyable gameplay. There is nice use of darkness and light which is a key element in the game. The game has different settings although it has a short scenario. I wish it was longer. Balanced action with humour and psychological referral, very good voice acting and nice characters and I think there is no more to say. "

												tl;dr: Criminally short game with arena style combat and tight controls. Pick up on sale for about $8 or less.Honestly, the levels are linear but there are certain parts where you be in arena type boss fight with hordes of enemies coming at you. It might sound tedious but shotgunning a guy in the foot and then picking them up to either slice them to get ammo, eat their heart for health, or pull their head out for a supernatural shield which you can hurl at other unfortunate baddies is pretty darn fun. The game almost has better gameplay than Doom (2016)Oh yes, the plot, mobster, Jackie Estucado, Johnny, Hospital, Darkness, Jenny, Vito Corleone... something... whatever.. KILL KILL MURDERAlthough I can't possibly recommend the game at full price, as it has an incredibly, INCREDIBLY short campaign, probably about 5 or 6 hours, and I got to the final level on my first sitting. If this game comes down to $4.99 or $9.99 during a sale, sure, get it. But $29.99 is too much.(There's also a ""not stealth at all"" hitman type vendetta mode, but that'll probably expand your playtime by an hour or two, and The Darkness featured in the main story isn't used.)p.s. the story ends on a cliffhanger which will most likely never get resolved. dont pick up this game for the story.

												An enjoyable but flawed shoot 'em up. The powers and enemies are fairly entertaining to play with and against. However, the teleporting enemies and whip soldiers get to be somewhat of a chore and there is an unfortunate propensity towards gamebreaking glitches in areas that will require multiple reloads before they manage to right themselves. The asylum sections are tedious and disengaging, and utilise a trope that has been seen far too often in fantasy, sci-fi and horror (Deep Space 9 used it at one point for Christ's sake). The characters are likeable, although the repetetive nature of certain dialogue lines can get on your nerves. It also breaks the golden rule of sequel-baiting. We're 5 years down the line and still no sign of a sequel. I can see why they ended it the way they did, but if a sequel happening was entirely dependent on sales, then they should've made it a conclusive ending. That said, this is likely why the option to either let the credits run or go back is present, so we can either have a complete story or a cliffhanger depending on your whim.A worthwhile game but unfortunately afflicted with problems that should really be addressed, especially after this long. If nothing else it needs to be patched.			"

												This is one great game! To be honest this game was way more fun then %80 of the stuff that came out for the last gen(PS3/xb360). It stays somewhat true to the comics but isn't the same game style as the first Darkness game. The Darkness 2 is a perfect example of an arcade fps done right.+ Graphics are stylized but good in the context+ Story is top shelf.+Game play is just fun, fun , fun.  A pistol in each hand, 2 serpents at my shoulders, ripping black holes from people..enough said!+Music is great, well balanced with the story, then ending theme is ...AAA movie status. (Tear Jerking Awesome)+ The voice acting is AAA for sure, campy, over the top at times, but its entertaining!+ New Game plus mode, and your skills carry over.....are you still reading this? Go buy the game already!only thing negative was the reusing of enemies and the dialogue the AI used was strange at times....This is one of the few games from the last 5 years I can actually replay over and over.

I ran into a few irritating bugs such as a constantly blurry screen and invisible walls but nothing that really ruined the game for me. Overall it's a fun short game with a few bugs but a ridiculous price tag and not much replayability. 6/10 just DON'T pay 30 bucks for it.			"

Short versionIf you like FPS games in general Darkness II is a good choice, and if you're a fan of Top Cow comics, then it's a must buy.Long versionThe Darkness 2 is a FPS based on the highly successful comic series published by Top Cow.You play as Jackie Estacado, leader of a New York mafia and the current host of the Darkness, an ancient force that's been passed down from generation to generation in the Estacado family.(Note: The Darkness is one of the 3 ancient entities in the Top Cow universe, the other 2 being the Angelus - pure light- and the Witchblade - balance between light and dark.)The game picks up where the prequel ended: Jenny, Jackie's lover is dead, and the mourning Jackie has repressed the Darkness. But when a mysterious organization, The Brotherhood is planning on eliminating Jackie and his organization and take the Darkness from him, he has no choice but to use the Darkness again to save himself. Sounds cheesy, I know.The game features a quad-wielding system, which means you can wield 2 different weapons, while the 2 demonic tendrils can be used to grab objects to shield yourself, or throw, or to execute enemies.As the host of the Darkness, Jackie has access to large variety of demonic abilites, however becoming vulnerable and blinded when exposed to light. This adds interesting elements to the gameplay: as you kill enemies you gain darkness essense, which can be used to learn new skills, becoming extremely strong. While Jackie's weakness to the light still forces the player to take cover and take out light sources constantly. The game has good looking cel-shaded graphics, and there's enough variety in the level designs to keep the player entertained throughout the story. Although the game doesn't have huge levels, hence not much exploration and the secrets can be found fairly easy too.Overall The Darkness II is a good FPS game, with solid gameplay and an interesting story with some psychological elements and a nice plot twist in the end, that imply a possible sequel.  PROS- Nice looking cell-shaded graphics.- 2 parallel campaigns: a single player storyline and a co-op campaign, showing the plot from different point of view.- Psychological aspect of the story.- Memorable characters. - Good variety of abilities.- Excellent voice acting.- Large arsenal, ranging from firearms, through various projectiles to Darkness abilities.CONS- Extremely short, and sometimes painfully cheesy story.- Not challanging enough: game can be beaten fairly easy even on highest difficulty.- Execution animations are glitchy sometimes.

												This game is amazing because it make you feel truely having 4 arms. It has very solid vibration feedback with 360 controller.Graphically speaking, this game is similiar to a comic style like borderland or the walking dead. It runs great on low spec machine or high end laptop graphic cards (i'm using 650m runing high on 1440p).This is one of the biggest surprise I found during winter sale 2013 (I bought around 20 AAA title in this sale session).Super value as I only paid USD4.5 from GMG.

												Game is short but sweet. Very strong gameplay makes it one of the best 3-6 hours of single player shooting you can get. I haven't even explored the extra content yet but I would already reccomend getting this game when it's cheap. The gameplay relies heavily on classic shooting elements, (at least on higher difficulties.) but there are also very high rewards and incetive to use your other powers.Storywise its nothing special,  not bad, but predictable and fairly unoriginal if well told.Basically if you want a fast, well paced single player shooter this one is definitely worth a look even if it is relatively easy even at the hardest moments.

												This game is quite a hidden gem in my opinion. The story is really good, with well written characters. The voice acting and use of music throughout the game is also really nice. The extremely fun gameplay is sadly pulled down by silly AI, linear levels and a very short campaign, took me just over 12 hours to 100%, thats 2 runs through the campaign. Overall a solid game, which is worth picking up on a sale, Jenny's a real qt3.14 btw.			"

												The super powers in this game where pretty cool and made the game fun.  As well as the leveling system is a cool addition from the Darkness I.  This Linear kill fest can be completed in short order which makes is an ideal title to get for a weekend playthrough.  It was easy on my older mid range graphics card but still look pretty good.  If you have time give it a chance. I am glad i spent my time on this title.			"

												TIME TO COMPLETE: 11.5 hoursTIME TO COMPLETE ACHIEVEMENTS: 19.2 hoursAlthough I started with the second, it is a shame that the first Darkness game wasn't ported to PC. Linear and handholding at the beggining, The Darkness II tells the story of Jackie Estacado, now the head of a mob familiy after his father's death. A lot of things, new and old, were brought together in an orderly fashion. The things that only fans of the series (a.k.a those who read the comics) would understand were summed up in a nice, compact way while still giving justice to the series.The campaign was short and it had its flaws but the story compensated. Jackie is a likeable character although many of his insults and macabre jokes from the comics were removed. The controls are clunky at first but they fit to the pacing of the game. There's also a single Darkling which accompanies you throughout the game (and makes up for Jackie's humour) instead of the multiple swarm from the first game but honestly I've never been the tactician type. A secondary campaign, Vendettas, makes up for gameplay. Being almost as long as the main storyline, this campaign is filled to the brink with arena-type encounters and boss fights. To be noticed, though, is that none of the bosses seemed too challenging to the point of being unfair. In fact some might consider them too easy. I played on the ""Mobster"" (Normal) difficulty.The four new characters we get introduced to are fitting to the overall universe but I consider them bland and making Jackie less unique. While they are sharing different personalities from each other we've seen these types of sterotypes before (the Japanese Katana guy, the Gung-ho lady, the Voodoo guy - probably the most unique out of all, the drunk Irish guy).Ignoring this there is also a list of several ""Hitlist"" missions which mainly just spans the same areas you've visited throughout the campaign, only refitted for different objectives and the kind. It's not like 90% of the campaign consisted of mostly clearing out areas of enemies and fighting boss battles from time to time. These are quickly done and should be finished in about 2 hours.Among all that, the game features a ""New Game+"" mode which allows you to replay missions independently in order to pick up remaining achievements and relics. The Relics were something I actively sought and were fun to collect. Don't get yourself fooled, though, because some of them are somewhat hard to find. Should I note that there are 2 possible endings?The Darkness II is a good game, and boy does it give justice to the series. Same thing but kept fresh. A price of 30$ is understandable at the time, but unless you're dying to play this I suggest you wait for sales.			"

												Great story, fun characters, decent game play. A good mix of shooter, rpg elements, and a slight bit of hack n' slash gameplay. The first game was better in terms of adventuring, as it was more open world. But the story pacing in this one is just as good, granted the first game has one of the saddest scenes in gaming. This game overall is a improvement with respect for the original, even if it goes in a different direction. I played this game through 3 times on the xbox 360. I hope they make a third one. It's worth it's current price, but if you see it on sale for 5$ it is a must have. Multiplater was also fun with four very different characters, but it's most like dead. Props to the creators for making a good single and multiplayer game.			"

												I, personally, really liked this game and regretted never having played the first part. After I got used to the controls (which took only about 5 Minutes - so it's not too complicated) it played fluently and the story kept motivating me. The idea is pretty inventive as far as I can tell and the mechanics are well-designed and -working. A big bonus (at least to me) is the graphics style which makes it much less ressource-hungry than other games from the genre.Only thing I would criticize is its length or rather its shortness. I would have loved to have more time to use all the different powers, but like this the second playthrough wil have to do.(9/10)			"

 Gory, brutal, action shooter Pros:Character DesignLevel Design AtmosphereFighting systemDemonwormarmsCons:Long grip animationsSome story-ish moments which take a little too long Need curtains because I hate light nowSadly I did not play The darkness I but I did really enjoy this part. At first I was thinking the Mafia atmosphere is not really matching with all the diabolic, obscure and eerie elements but this first feeling was proven wrong. I really liked the idea of the fighting system... I like being able to slash NPC's and throw a black hole at them while reloading both of my weapons... I am not a big fan of the ""grip"" moves though they feel like they are breaking the gameflow a little.Also I think I never saw light being used in such a way in a game. It is always a shocking moment when u notice your demonwormarms are gone and you have to panically shoot the light :D The use of the voice in the head and the visualized effects that come with it are crazy, love em! The imp or whatever it is was a great character! Also the scenes in which u enter the mental facility are just the right mix of confusing and creepy. This game was definitely not boring at any point, new elements and one time events seem to where fired at me all the time and the atmosphere and scene switches definitely kept me entertained.Just starting to play vendettas and they are fun! love the idea with the different characters!

												I would rate this game 8. Awsome voice acting, it controls and feels well to play, the combat is fun and enjoyable with the tencles. The story is very engaging as well. The bad points of this game would be that the story is a bit too short and more linear a lot more than in the first darkness which was a bit more open and after the second or third mission there are no longer differant enemies introduced. Overall definatly a great game had a lot of fun playing it. Hope they make a third one.			"

												I absolutely love this game! From the visual graphic novel style graphics, the gun and tentacle toting gameplay, the stereotyped mob characters, and to the delightful voice acting, this game has provided me with many hours of entertainment. The story is just deep enough to keep you interested, the characters are just deep enough for you to actually like them, and the environments are nicely varied but the gameplay is its strong point with its unique ""Quad-Wielding"" combat. The Single-Player Campaign may seem a bit short for some but the Co-op Campaign is almost just as fun and it sort of makes up for it as some of the missions intertwine/connect with the Single-Player Campaign story. All in all everything adds up to an awesomely fun game that I have played and completed many a time and I will certainly play again.Oh but if you are planning on buying it, I would suggest you wait until it's on sale to get it.

												The Darkness 2 is a very under-rated game due its short Single Player campaign and replay value. But believe me I'm a total sucker for this game it got me really hooked. It's a dark story which features some genuine emotion in its narrative and also has realistic & very impressive voice acting. Though actual campaign is short, you can very well replay it with all your unlocked powers on New Game + Mode. While the Vendetta Mode adds a lot of good additional content to the Co-op game (which is very fun to play with Friends) Off course don't expect 100+ Hrs of gameplay here, on the hardest difficulty (""Don"") the Single Player Campaign along with Co-op Campaign & Hitlists should give you at least 15 - 25 Hrs of solid gameplay. when u can go & grab it!

												Ok, so I was expecting a regular FPS.But, I was wrong, Darkness II was a bit of a shocker to me, it was really good, kinda short maybe, but fun and had a solid story.Story: (Trying not to make spoilers)The game is based on a comic series called, yep, you guessed it, The Darkness.You play as Jackie Estacado, a mafia boss that possess the forces of darkness. Jackie tries to keep his darkness at bay, but after a rival mafia tries to kill you, you have no option but to start a war and unleash the darkness within you upon your enemies.But, when you unleash the darkness, you also cut a deal with it, and there's a price to pay at the end...Graphics:The game graphics reminded me Borderlands but more realistic, and i like it :) kinda gives you the feel of a comics (which it is based on a comic series)Gameplay:The game is FPS and RPG of some sort, where you gain XP from kills and level your skills, but apart from the guns and black magic you also have 2 tenticals that devours, kill, cutting off heads and ripping the limbs of people (Tons of blood and gore)When you are not cutting and killing, you also play as your little lackey, which is more stealthy than just killing everybody.Also, there are some levels that are purely for the story, they are short but very fun and delivers the awesome story to you, I loved those parts!Conclusion:This game kinda surprised me, I loved the story, the cut-scenes are great, the gameplay is fun, the graphics are very nice and feel you get is very good.and even though it's short (took me about 6 hours to finish the game on Hard, but you can play it and make different decisions), it's really good!Play it!***There's also multiplayer but I didn't play it honestly, for no reason really*** "

	The Darkness II is a first person shooter with some strong story elements.  It also offers some multiplayer/co-op options, where you havethe availability to play a different campaign than the one you play solo,which is nice.  	The story is loosely based on The Darkness comic series, and takes place two years after the first game.  You play as Jackie Estacado, the don of a crime family that posesses a supernatural power called The Darkness.With this power, you have extra arms, or tentacles, that can pick up enemies, throw objects, and  other options that are added as you progress through thegame. The story is very narrational based and entertaining, and connects onan emotional level to the player.  	There are a variety of weapons that are offered;  the recoil on eventhe most basic weapons are very well done, as well as the aim and reload time.They don't ever feel like they are too weak.  The combat is also done well,giving a sense of urgency as you progress through, and a fluidity during battles.   	The darkness has powers and abilities that you can unlock and upgradeas you progress through the game.  There is a decent variety in the selectionof abilities, and they do run on a cool down time.  I felt that the combatwas fair, and rewarded me appropriately as I went through levels.  	As for level design, the game is very linear, but it does compensate for that with a strong fluidity of the combat.  As you progress throughthe levels, the story as well as the fluidity of combat helps break up thelinear feel of it.  The game is consistant in its' aesthetic and atmosphere,and everything flowed very well.  	 There were a few minor issues, which I detail in my video review, butoverall this is a good game with well done combat and a compelling story.  Thelevel design is basic, but I never felt my time was wasted, and I can easilyrecommend this game.This is a summary of what I talk about in the video, I am a YT'er not a BloggerThanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												I’m Jackie Estacado and I am the host for the Darkness. It’s a rough life fighting it from taking me over completely but man does it have some sweet powers. There has been some bad consequences though like losing the love of my life Jenny. I’m dealing with that and now some brotherhood wants to take the Darkness from me. Not going to happen on my watch.In the Darkness II you are still suffering from the loss of Jenny from the first game. You have held the Darkness at bay for a while but now some group called the Brotherhood wants to take it from you using a device called the siphon which will suck the Darkness out of you. Well you aren’t going to let this happen because it’s just bad news for everyone.There are a variety of ways to play through the levels fighting the Brotherhood. You can quad-wield now unlike the first game which gives you options like rip a car door off and use it as a shield while still being able to carry two guns and whip people with you other Darkness tentacle. Special executions can be done by grabbing an enemy with the tentacles, while he is stunned, and rip them apart for more health or ammo. You can also upgrade your powers via a skill tree wheel to add more possibilities like an execution that makes a shield from the enemy or had a Darkness swarm which stuns enemies for a short time. Unlike the first game you only have one Darkling to help you but he has more of a personality than before. He adds a little humor to everything which lightens the dark mood a bit. Guns are your standard fair ranging from pistols, smgs, assault rifles, and shotguns. You can upgrade you guns to buy adding bigger clips, faster reloads, and shooting Darkness essence through them.The game does look good most of the time with its comic book pastel art style. Environments seemed to be pretty bland though and felt like I was just going through a reskinned map each level. Enemies were also basic with pretty much the same five skins all the time. Story wise I wasn’t too impressed and sometimes felt like I was just pushing forward to finish the game so it was no longer in my backlog. I just felt like it was just missing something the whole time. The endings, there are two choices, were both mediocre and not fulfilling. Expected a bigger finish than it was. You can replay it again in new game+ which lets you keep all your unlocked powers. I just didn’t feel the pull to do it though.Darkness II also has a co-op campaign mode called Vendetta you can play with up to four players. It’s basically a side story to the campaign where you can control your choice of four different characters who have their own special Darkness powers. All these characters also have skills you can upgrade to make them more powerful. There is another mode you can pick through Vendetta called The Hit List which is basically shorter missions using the Vendetta campaign levels. Both these modes are cool to play with some friends but doesn’t really add much to the game.Overall if you’re a fan of the comic and enjoyed the first Darkness then you’ll want to check this one out. It could have been much more without the co-op stuff and just focused on the single player portion of the game but it is still a decent game to play.Bear Rating 7.0/10			"

												La trama está copada, me gusta que gire en torno a la oscuridad, además tiene algunas cosas particulares que son muy buenas. Jugablemente es divertido, podés llevar un arma en cada mano y a la vez usar los tentáculos. Depende de como matés a los enemigos te dan cierta cantidad de puntos con los que después comprás upgrades y poderes. Hay algunos muy grosos, como el de los agujeros negros. El estilo gráfico está bárbaro, hay que tener en cuenta que el juego parte de una serie de cómics, así que se entiende por qué eligieron el cell-shading, aún así no deja de ser ""siniestro"" y gore.El coop es una campaña spin-off y un par de misiones extra, hay 4 personajes para elegir, cada uno con su propio artefacto de la oscuridad y su skill especial. Es medio denso y repetitivo, pero la última parte tiene algo que la campaña principal no, un buen boss final.Es cortito, pero aprovechando eso y que el juego está muy bueno, le saqué todos los logros (En 13 horas no más). Podés seguir rejugándolo en NG+, pero a la 2da ya le sacaste todo el jugo.			"

												Do you wanna feel like a complete badass? Do you want a game that mixes fps goodness with super powers and actually pulls it off? Well you've found your game. The Darkness II has awesome graphics, hilariously gorey death scenes, and a very interesting storyline. The game is VERY immersive, ESPECIALLY IN- (Slight spoiler ahead) Especially when the game brings you into a mental hospital where you are a patient. You really feel the fright and terror of being an actual patient in a mental hospital as your insanity grows stronger and strongerThe combat is VERY smooth from the fps to the use of your ""darkness"" powers. There is a co-op mode where you can play with your friends in a storyline that runs parallel to the singleplayer storyline, extending the lifetime of the game. However the singleplayer campaign itself is pretty darn short (about 5 hours) and doesn't have much replayability due to the fact of how linear it his.However this game is quite the experience and I would recommend it for anyone and everyone looking to have a good and comical time. I'd also recommend it to anyone looking to have a serious and exciting time, as this game pleases many audiences! Definitely worth picking up!Final Verdict- 8/10. AMAZING game, but VERY short.			"

												Decent game, but a very generic fps which lacks in boss fights but over all a good game. However i  wouldnt pay full price for this game and would only get it in a sale or on another website that offers steam keys you can pick this game up from♥♥♥♥♥for just under 5 pounds which i recommend. 7.5/10			"

												Great game. I like the story that has many aspects of mafia movies. That is so cool, especially as everybody in your clan thinks its totally normal that you have superhuman powers. Dark powers. And then there is a story twist where you are in a psychiatry. Awesome game. After finishing it, I will replay it in the ""New Game+"" mode.			"

												Let me sum up The Darkness (1) for you(Just in case you didn't play the first one): The player takes the role of Jackie Estacado (voiced by Kirk Acevedo), with the story presented as a future-narrative on the present events observed by the player. On the eve of his 21st birthday, Jackie is targeted for assassination by ""Uncle"" Paulie Franchetti (voiced by Dwight Schultz), a New York Mafia boss, following a failed task to retrieve money for the latter. While hiding in a cemetery bathroom, the Darkness (voiced by Mike Patton), an ancient demonic force that has inhabited his family for several generations, awakens within Jackie and slaughters the remaining mobsters, with the benefit of Jackie becoming the possessor of seemingly unholy demonic abilities that work only in the dark. Using these powers, Jackie proceeds to destroy Paulie's business by killing his biggest drug peddler, Dutch Oven Harry (voiced by Richard Leighton), and burning down the slaughterhouse where he stores his money. In retribution, Paulie and his main enforcer, Captain Eddie Shrote (voiced by Jim Mathers) of the New York City Police Department, kidnap Jackie's girlfriend Jenny Romano (voiced by Lauren Ambrose). They take her to the orphanage where Jackie and Jenny grew up and murder her in front of a powerless Jackie, who is unable to save Jenny due to the Darkness deliberately restraining him.Jackie then commits suicide out of sheer emotional stress, finding himself in the Otherworld, the realm of the Darkness, which is home to patchwork undead beings in World War I outfits fighting each other and physical manifestations of the Four Horsemen. He meets his great-great-grandfather Anthony Estacado (voiced by Kirk Baltz), who reveals that it was he that brought the Darkness into the family and tells Jackie how to free himself of the Darkness by invading the castle in the Otherworld and facing the Darkness there. Jackie is interrupted in his journey through the Otherworld and brought back to the living.Once he recovers, Jackie determines that he must dispose of Captain Shrote before he can face Paulie. After failing to kill Shrote at his apartment, Jackie steals a briefcase containing illicit goods in Shrote's ownership from a Turkish bath that is used as a front by his corrupt police officers. Jackie rigs the briefcase with an explosive and sets up a meeting with Shrote at Trinity Church. Jackie heads to the meeting to kill Shrote, but he is instead captured by his men following a shootout. After overhearing about a shipment of drugs that a Chicago mob is entrusting to Paulie to handle from one of Shrote's officers, Jackie triggers the explosive, killing Shrote and his men along with himself. Jackie re-awakes in the Otherworld and lays siege to the Darkness's castle with Anthony's help. Anthony is mortally wounded in the attack, but before he can tell Jackie the last steps needed to free himself from the Darkness, the spirit pulls him away.Jackie faces the Darkness and surprises it by willingly being taken by the Darkness's power, allowing him to fully control the spirit back in the real world. However, the Darkness tells him that while he has control now, each time Jackie takes a life, he will become more consumed by the Darkness. He lays an assault on the drug shipment, causing Paulie to flee to the safety of a lighthouse mansion for fear of retribution from the Chicago mob. Jackie takes advantage of a solar eclipse to raid the mansion and finally kill Paulie. The Darkness revels in Jackie's murderous spree, and fully envelops Jackie.In the epilogue, Jackie finds himself in a dream, lying on a park bench in Jenny's arms. Jenny explains that they are only allowed a few minutes to be together one last time to say goodbye. Jackie tries to ask how, but Jenny just quiets him, allowing them to enjoy the last moments together before Jackie wakes back up with the screen fading to black.Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Darkness_(video_game)The Darkness 2 on the other hand takes you into the New life of Jackie Estacado.

												A visceral and explosive shooter that gives you a ton and a half of tools to play with in its entirely too short duration.Pros:+ Story is original and captivating for the most part. Some characters, including the protagonist, are interesting and well voice-acted.+ Technical graphics are a bit dated, but artistically, they're pretty unique and relishable. Some real cool set-pieces and enviornments.+ Your options are immense. Decent array of guns, ""Darkness"" demons allow for varried melee, special attacks, executions, and thrown projectiles.+ Neat skill system that lets you tailor your play-style to execution, melee, special attacks, guns, or a bit of all four.+ Weapons and Darkness weapons have brutal impact. Did I mention quad-wielding?+ Enemy variety forces you to change tactics.Cons:- ""Avoid/destroy enviornmental lights, they hurt you"" gets old and dissorienting really quickly. Your screen is often blurred trying to find a light to shoot, disabiling your darkness powers and letting enemies tear you apart while it happens.- The mafia tone to the story is horridly stereotypical. Good thing it shifts to the supernatural pretty quickly. - Some enemies are annoying or blatantly unfair. Flashbang throwers, whip-carriers that steal your guns, shield carriers.- Some actions can conflict due to the same button being used for them. The E key eats enemy's hearts to replishing your HP, but also picks up guns. I've swapped plenty of guns on accident and died because I didn't get my health pickup.- Too short. Main campaign took me 5 hours on second hardest difficulty.- ""Vendetta"" missions do not use Jackie. They're co-op missions with a new crew of marauders, but you'll miss a lot of Jackie's abilities.^ Cons are nit-picky for the most part, but some really tear you out from the action too much. This game is worth buying if just for the main campaign alone, but know how short it is. Too unique and too fun to dismiss.			"

												PROS:Interesting story. It grips you.Game play style is customizable which leads to fun variations. Decent variation in the guns you get.All characters, even minor ones are voiced and voiced well.Environmental awareness (light) is an interesting aspect.CONS:Short, can beat it in a day or less.Can't equip pre mission with guns, it's find and replace every mission.Sometimes the environmental lighting seems forces or lacking inventiveness. They kinda ruin an aspect of the twist with an obvious spoiler in-game.V-sync issue, need to turn it on and off to fix blur bug.BOTTOM LINE:I liked it, wouldn't pay full price. But it's a good $5 game. The story and the fun variation in the game play would make me play another title. I have no desire to replay it however. A one and done.			"

												I found this game in my backlog, must have been included in a Humble Bundle or something. Anyhow The Darkness 2 is a nice little game that offers some fun gameplay and a couple of extra missions that you can play together with a buddy. The campagin is only about 5-6 hours if you run through it at a decent pace. The game offers a New Game + where you can keep all your abilites and play through the game again if you feel your craving for the dark has not yet been satisfied. I however chose not to play the New Game +, I simply did not think the game was that good. The Darkness 2 makes an attempt at a story but all the twists and turns are very generic and predcitable and some of the levels are frankly pretty boring. I'd play this if you find it in your backlog like I did or if you are able to pay it for under 5€, otherwise, you can safely pass.			"

												The Darkness II is a good game, especially for achievement hunters who seek an FPS that's challenging but doesn't require endless grinding to 100%, but also for everyone else who wants to play a fun FPS with original story, more or less unique gameplay, pretty cool cel-shaded graphics (the gore is still perfectly beautiful) and an extra coop campaign.

												It's strange how sometimes you can like a game the first 10 minutes, see yourself hate it thoroughly after playing 30 minutes, almost giving the entire game up, and in the end love it so much it's end up on your favorites games list... The Darkness II is NOT that type of game. The first game however, is definitely that type of game. After a slow start and what seems to be a big nuisance -the maze of connected levels through the New York subway- it starts to grow on you, it feels like you are right there with Jackie Estacado, a betrayed hitman for the mafia, helping him travel from the one rotten place to the next forsaken hell (literally) all the while thinking about your sins and the losses you had to suffer. And all of this because a evil force is helping you fulfill your vengeance but by every heart taken from the bodies of fallen enemies it takes you one step closer to the darkness and its goal to ultimately take complete control of your mind, will and body. There develops and plays out a story that’s gruesome and poetic at times, you will remember it, it will haunt you. Let's spill the beans right now for those not interested in reading a lengthy piece. It's not easy to follow up Starbreeze's gem but Digital Extremes (DE) did a good job for a sequel. While it does not satisfy as much and does not answer all the burning questions you have after playing the first one (how did Jackie return?) they at least took over most important aspects and characters from the first one that made it memorable and continue on those. That also has it's flip side, when a sequel focuses on the most memorable aspects it forgets the subtle details that made the first great. The new york subway as a game hub is no more and therefore the unique pacing of the first game is also gone. This game capitalizes on the action and creates a big deja vu of the first story and works towards a way too obvious end. As such you will feel for the characters only because you went on the dark journey with them in the first, not from what you experience in the Darkness II.But the action, that it does good. While I personally enjoyed the more realistic style of the first, the cell shaded look of the second game will not throw you off that much. It's still gory and it still has many themes that could be deemed controversial for a game and I guess because the game did not became that much of a hit that these moments have gone unnoticed. The gun game play is improved and you get more darkness powers to play with (damn you stupid skill trees, choices, choices...). DE was also smart enough to leave out some overpowered skills out of the game or downgrade them a little bit to make the playing field more fair. The enemies are also much aware of the Darkness and it's powers and flaws and are much tougher then the unknowing mobsters from the first game. Flash grenades and portable lights will certainly give you a fight to find a spot of darkness and to unleash your dark powers. In the end I enjoyed the darkness II very much for its game play and rehearses of the first games story. However, I play a game for it's story and hoped for a different direction, a story arc the same as the first is a bit of a let down. If you have your heart set on playing this then play the first game first and then decide if you want to play the Darkness II. If you do you will at least play this game with more passion for the characters and you will already have developed a love/hate relationship with one of the coolest voices featured in a game and the gravely twisted mind that is the Darkness.

												The gameplay never gets old, the graphics feature a unique cel shaded look, the story is fantastic (up until the ending, anyway), and a couple of the characters are actually interesting. Jackie's darkness powers are a blast to use, and the light RPG elements make the game feel all the more rewarding with its point system.Pick this game up on sale; the 6-7 hour campaign is totally worth it!

												The Darkness II is a short (single player campaign is about 5-6 hours) and gory but a rather fun game. The story is somewhat depressing but it also sets the mood for it. You're meant to feel Jackie's rage - and he will rage, a lot. The plot has some rather interesting twists, which made it enjoyable. The game is cartoon-styled, much like Borderlands and The Walking Dead. I really like the way the game looks and it makes the gory details seem less.. gross.  The gameplay is really fun, you earn points on being creative that you can spend on upgrading your abilities, in the end you might feel like you're almost invincible. Since the Darkness is vulnerable in the light you have to stay out of it, which can be a challenge sometimes. I love the game play, the demon arms are a fun addition and saves the game from becoming just a generic shooter. You also have a companion that you can throw around, he deserves it for calling you ""Monkey""!There are some extra side-missions with co-op and a new game+ mode as well that might earn the game a bit more replay value. Since it's a short game you should keep in mind if you are considering to buy it.			"

												UhNot too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

												Brutality!Darkness II is about   jacki who is head of mafia group,or is a mental patient.However He has darkness power which is Two powerfull monster on the left and right side of his shoulder that trying to controll Jacki!During game you can easily kill your enemies with your gun,or Darkness will do this.There are some features that allow you to upgrade your ability and Darkness' ability.Darkness can throw everything such as a door,a fan etc.If you worry about Darkness I story,before Darkenss II starts You can see what happend for Jacki in Darkness I and why he is in this situation now which is very good to have a better connection with story,however I think story was so stereotype,Jacki want to save his love? or She already dead? some people want to steal Darkness,although end of the story was not bad and probably you will ask He was really a Mafia boss?!I didn't play coop part ,but looks like It's fun with your friends.Less than 5hrs you can finish this game which is very awful for a 30$ game,so it's better to buy it on sale!However It was very good experience and I recommend it if price goes lower than this!

												It is an okay game.It is no where near as good as the Darkness 1.  The original!!There are many many features removed, like now you eat a heart to cast a spell like a black hole, in the original you could just spawn one when you want.You had the ability to cast any special feature you wanted, and you could control the monster arms to slither through a wall, up and around and attack... Now you cannot.There are many many things that where great about the game been removed.Would I suggest this? Yes but only just.The gameplay is fun, the game is fun, the control is easy and you can now play co-op, the graphics are decent, the audio is okay.Everything else no.  It is a major let down that they removed so many key features of the original but then they added co-op and that made it fun.I paid full price for this, and it is currently on sale daily deal (09/12/2013) for £4.99 and that is worth the price even though I paid £29.99.The origina is still the best, and this is more of a changed version and not the best change but a worth wild play for the decent story.

												The Darkness II is a rather generic shooter with a few neat gameplay innovations.PROS:+ the powers of the Darkness(basically, you control guns in your regular hands and the tentacles for ripping enemies in pieces and/or throwing♥♥♥♥♥♥around)+ high end voice acting+ comic book aesthetics+ multiplayer campaign tying in with the main storylineCONS:- short- the cliche storyThis game is decent.It's quite enjoyable. Not much to whine about either.Doesn't shine too brightly, but then again- the Darkness...Grab it on sale if you like the Darkness comic book series and/or are into Italian-mob-ancient-demons-secret-societies-conspiracy-a-man-with-nothing-to-lose-tragic-love-story kind of thing.Jackie Estacado can't wait to feed some scumbags' hearts to the Darkness.""There's always a little light in the darkness.""

												I love the arcade style gameplay, i enjoy the story although it could have been better and most importantly, im a huge fan of the gore involved.The execution animations are pretty awesome and even though the game is pretty straightforward and some might find it simplistic, its good to just go in, kill some bad guys in a badass way and finish the missions.The co-op is also pretty good, playing with your friends is awesome.That ending doe...8/10.

Cool storyline, amazing superpowers intertwined with gun dualwielding and configurable FoV make this game so damn satisfying.

												I hated it for only 2 mins , then I finished the game in 2 days and I loved it ....I kinda got shocked by the graphics , as you know it is completely different from the first one ... so on the beginning video of the game, I was like ""NO!!! WHY YOU DID THIS"" but the game started. I started to play it even I was not really into the graphics but OH boy! the game got better and better. I LOVED IT. *****************************************************************************************SPOILER OF THE DARKNESS 1 , If you haven't played the first one, I suggest you to get that one done before getting the second one because everything would make more senesce. AND DO NOT READ THE NEXT PARAGRAPH   *****************************************************************************************I had very good memories with the first Darkness and it was a great experience. I loved the game so much that I finished it 3 times. It had a unique atmosphere. Well the game was really dark and serious with main character, ""Jackie"", going through a lot, trying to fight the darkness while it was taking control of him. It was a part in the game, (first one) that Jackie sees his girlfriend, and I remember that I feel bad for him. Felt that this poor guy deserves love and happiness but then again everything changes. The second game is really a different experience, This time you feel strong. You feel like a god. for the fans, I really suggest to buy this game, specially once it has been out for a while and it always gets big discounts. Telling you what , buy this game on the next sell for less than $5 but enjoy it cause it will be one of your favorite games.  "

												Fret not if you've never played the original Darkness. While many allusions are made its way, The Darkness II has you covered with a concise recap.The first Darkness was a mess of a game, marred with terrible voice acting, animations, controls, gameplay, and numerous other bugs. The Darkness II, a product by another team of developers, is fortunately an exemplary sequel, fixing nearly every flaw and adding major improvements in ways unimaginable.Graphically, The Darkness II's cel shading is simply beautiful, fitting right in with its comic book counterpart. The animations are smooth and the over-the-top violence is a blast to watch. Controls, especially during combat, flow extremely well, even in the face of the overwhelming number abilities available.While the single player campaign isn't too lengthy, the game doubles its duration with the inclusion of a cooperative mode offering 18 missions and 4 new, unique characters. There's simply a lot of content to be found.Grade: B			"

												One of my favorite comic books, and done pretty pretty damn well, twice, but in completely different flavors.  The first one had more of a roaming kinda feel, go through the city, and all that, this one is more traditional FPS level based like Doom or wolfenstein.  but with plenty of story throughout. Alot more gore than the first one, but the cell shaded comic look to the set is done great. I really love this game. The tone is gritty and dark with a good pallette of colors. The audio is top notch and the music suited the game, but nothing noteworthy that I can remember, haven't bought or dl'd the soundtrack. The ending was abrupt and left me wanting more with no real final boss either.  But good overall, and I would like a continuation. Fans of the series will find this a must buy. 7/10			"

												It's a fun game, for the six or so hours that the campaign lasts. And I played it on hard.You play as a generic mafioso who, after the tutorial, reveals that he's the host for The Darkness, a malevolent entity which gleefully kills people in a bunch of horrifically fun ways. About halfway through the plot your character is killed and is then resurrected by The Darkness, which makes you realize that dying during gameplay really shouldn't be that big a deal if your inner demon can just bring you back to life following the subtle plot twist of getting shotgunned in the face.I have some minor gripes with the controls; you'll want to remap them or else your attempts to aim, shoot, and flail around with your demon arms basically results in you stumbling and haphazardly firing your guns into the ceiling and walls like a drunken redneck.There is a variety of enemies to encounter who make the combat a lot of fun and interesting.The plot and it's overall theme of sanity and evil versus absolute evil were quite enjoyable, and I liked that the game had at least two different endings.I haven't played the 'vendetta' content yet, but considering the ""Main Story"" lasted less than six hours I feel justified reviewing the game without playing all of its content.

												With it's story depending highly on your experience of Starbreeze's console exclusive release of 2007, it is some wonder that this sequel to Darkness was made available for PC or, heck, even at all when you consider how the first game even ended. Yet with the stark differences in art-style and ultimately approach to the structure itself  in The Darkness 2, Digital Extremes also wisely fixed the cumbersome combat of the original Darkness with much better shooting mechanics and much better implementation of the titular demon itself during fights. Additionally, the co-op heavy Vendettas game mode is a nice surprise and a lot of fun both online and off. Performance is neither an issue here or there with this one, The Darkness II can be maxed out smoothly on modest DX10 video cards and budget Dual core CPUs although it doesn't quite have proper full-frame support, squashing the picture similar to Digital Extreme's previous work on Homefront. Otherwise, aside from the occassional cheap enemy chokepoint, you're more than likely to enjoy what you get out of The Darkness II, especially if it is less than £5.			"

I cleared it twice and do not regret my purchase, definitely recommended. When a game leaves you wanting more, it is doing something good...			"

												The Darkness 2 has passable gameplay with about 10 weapons, half of them being what I would consider upgrades of a lower tier. It has a low replay value with not much to do after beating the Story and Vendetta/Hit List Missions (about 9-10 hours altogether). The best thing it has going for it and why I recommend the game is the single player Campaign portion of the game.There is very little stalling in the plot. The game starts with the reveal of a new enemy and has about 3 objectives that are logical to progressing before starting the arc with the big bad guy. To me that is very efficient at getting to the point. I was nervous every time a sentimental moment happened, worried if the game would do a cheap jumpscare. It compelled me to care about what was going on and that is a rare feeling for me to have with dramatic stories like this.Each time you can go back to your base, the other characters have different things to tell you that aren't always related to what you are doing, such as the story told about eddie when Jackie and Vincent are catching up. If you are into playing a game and exploring the subtle changes, you will be rewarded for your time. The plot constantly attempts to mess with your judgement of the situation and makes every chance for a choice an uneased gut check.Check the game out when you have the opportunity to pay attention to the dialogue and really grasp the story. It was inspired by a comic book series and plays like reading an interactive graphic novel.			"

												Having only played the demo for The Darkness, I didn't have much expectation for The Darkness 2. Thankfully The Darkness 2 turns out to be a fun experience all round! The game changes its art style from a gritty realistic style to a more cel-shaded approach which makes the game look very stylish and contrasts well with the high levels of violence. Gameplay doesn't change all that much with only minor alterations such as the introduction of one constant helper imp rather than a few and more options with the titular Darkness such as grabbing more objects and an upgrade tree, which spices up the standard shooting nicely. Story and characters are pretty solid with special mention to Mike Patton as The Darkness, breathing life into this evil entity with a voice that'll make your skin crawl. So if you're in the mood for a fun FPS with some great style, give it a shot!			"

But that is not only it you can play a special campaing mode with 4 3 2 or 1 or even alone it gives you 4 characters to play (if you completed the campaing the missions in this mode will make sense) giving you new skill Tree which each character has its own unique wepon and skill tree. Feel the game is too easy well the difficulty are awesome if you want a real challenge come and play this game is awesome and campaing maybe a short if you are a good player with low difficulty.			"

												After having a blast with this fun but tragically short game, I will forever mourn the lack of ultraviolent tentacle-enhanced combat action in any other first person game I play.  On the downside, the linearity of the otherwise sufficiently engaging story, the shooting-gallery feel of some of the levels, the homogeneity of the enemies, the claustrophobic feel of always being stuck in first-person view makes the prospect of a second play-through not very appealing for me.  However, the game IS worth playing for the singular experience of being a terrifying monster of a human being tearing a very bloody, very creatively-executed swath through hordes of cannon-fodder.  Get it when it's on sale for dirt-cheap and have yourself a gleefully violent time for a few short hours.			"

												It's a fun game, for the six or so hours that the campaign lasts. And I played it on hard.You play as a generic mafioso who, after the tutorial, reveals that he's the host for The Darkness, a malevolent entity which gleefully kills people in a bunch of horrifically fun ways. About halfway through the plot your character is killed and is then resurrected by The Darkness, which makes you realize that dying during gameplay really shouldn't be that big a deal if your inner demon can just bring you back to life following the subtle plot twist of getting shotgunned in the face.I have some minor gripes with the controls; you'll want to remap them or else your attempts to aim, shoot, and flail around with your demon arms basically results in you stumbling and haphazardly firing your guns into the ceiling and walls like a drunken redneck.There is a variety of enemies to encounter who make the combat a lot of fun and interesting.The plot and it's overall theme of sanity and evil versus absolute evil were quite enjoyable, and I liked that the game had at least two different endings.I haven't played the 'vendetta' content yet, but considering the ""Main Story"" lasted less than six hours I feel justified reviewing the game without playing all of its content.

												Fret not if you've never played the original Darkness. While many allusions are made its way, The Darkness II has you covered with a concise recap.The first Darkness was a mess of a game, marred with terrible voice acting, animations, controls, gameplay, and numerous other bugs. The Darkness II, a product by another team of developers, is fortunately an exemplary sequel, fixing nearly every flaw and adding major improvements in ways unimaginable.Graphically, The Darkness II's cel shading is simply beautiful, fitting right in with its comic book counterpart. The animations are smooth and the over-the-top violence is a blast to watch. Controls, especially during combat, flow extremely well, even in the face of the overwhelming number abilities available.While the single player campaign isn't too lengthy, the game doubles its duration with the inclusion of a cooperative mode offering 18 missions and 4 new, unique characters. There's simply a lot of content to be found.Grade: B			"

												Extremely good game! Beautiful graphics and audio! The gameplay is extremely bloody and violent which makes everything even better! There are a lot of missions and the story in the game is pretty damn interesting. You feel really overpowered all the time i really like that. The multiplayer is good although it could have been better if more features were added. And the ending is heart-breaking! Adding a little drama to this game was a brilliant thought. I really recommend this game if you like FPS's, decapitating and dismembering people. If you do then this is the game for you! Rated 10/10!			"

												The Darkness 2 has passable gameplay with about 10 weapons, half of them being what I would consider upgrades of a lower tier. It has a low replay value with not much to do after beating the Story and Vendetta/Hit List Missions (about 9-10 hours altogether). The best thing it has going for it and why I recommend the game is the single player Campaign portion of the game.There is very little stalling in the plot. The game starts with the reveal of a new enemy and has about 3 objectives that are logical to progressing before starting the arc with the big bad guy. To me that is very efficient at getting to the point. I was nervous every time a sentimental moment happened, worried if the game would do a cheap jumpscare. It compelled me to care about what was going on and that is a rare feeling for me to have with dramatic stories like this.Each time you can go back to your base, the other characters have different things to tell you that aren't always related to what you are doing, such as the story told about eddie when Jackie and Vincent are catching up. If you are into playing a game and exploring the subtle changes, you will be rewarded for your time. The plot constantly attempts to mess with your judgement of the situation and makes every chance for a choice an uneased gut check.Check the game out when you have the opportunity to pay attention to the dialogue and really grasp the story. It was inspired by a comic book series and plays like reading an interactive graphic novel.			"

												With it's story depending highly on your experience of Starbreeze's console exclusive release of 2007, it is some wonder that this sequel to Darkness was made available for PC or, heck, even at all when you consider how the first game even ended. Yet with the stark differences in art-style and ultimately approach to the structure itself  in The Darkness 2, Digital Extremes also wisely fixed the cumbersome combat of the original Darkness with much better shooting mechanics and much better implementation of the titular demon itself during fights. Additionally, the co-op heavy Vendettas game mode is a nice surprise and a lot of fun both online and off. Performance is neither an issue here or there with this one, The Darkness II can be maxed out smoothly on modest DX10 video cards and budget Dual core CPUs although it doesn't quite have proper full-frame support, squashing the picture similar to Digital Extreme's previous work on Homefront. Otherwise, aside from the occassional cheap enemy chokepoint, you're more than likely to enjoy what you get out of The Darkness II, especially if it is less than £5.			"

If you are looking for an game that is actually original and has depth characters meaning Jenny/Jackie/Darkling then sure go for it. If you've not played either then I'd recommend playing the first on xbox360/ps3 cause its not avaliable on pc for some reason. Either way must have if you like rich stories and or gore/horror.

												This game is one of those great weekend games that you can pick up and beat In just a couple of days,The combat is fast and fun and very violent, all the way from the starting credits to the final battle (depending on what you choose, but no spoilers).All the action of the game is supplemented by short trips to your home base, were you can talk to other characters in the game for tid bits of lore and comments on your current objectives, there are also a few little mini games you can play that will help you get in some target practice...... ill just call it that lol.The game also features simple rpg mechanic that gives you the chance to upgrade skills depeneding on your play style, the game rewards you for killing in varied and unique was and its great fun to try out all the new tactics that you will unlock as you progress further along in a skill branch.Only CON I can say with this game is the length, if you power your way through as I did on a second playthrough with some skills under your belt you can EZLY beat the game in about 4 hours, however if you take the time to test out new skills (BLACK HOLE FTW!!!), take time to talk to all the characters in the game, which I suggest you do on first run, the game can EZLY last for a good 8 hours.I would say the overall experience is worth the asking price, but if you see it on sale, pick it up with out a doubt.7/10, would give it a 8/10 if the game was just a bit longer.

												I pick this up after I read an article that placed it in the best 50 FPS ever made. And DAMN if they weren't right. The first thing I noticed upon starting the game is that I was missing a LOT of backstory. I managed to piece most of it together before the end, but I'm still not clear on some things. So, you're Jackie Estacado, some sort of Mafia Don. You're well-loved by the people in your organization, even they're very much aware that you've made some sort of deal with a demonic entity that causes you to sprout eel-like growths from your back that you can cut people in half with (Which I find weird, considering that most popular media portrays most of the Italian mob as at least moderately Catholic, but whatever).The game is starting to show it's age, but when it came out, it would have been looking pretty good. It's still an attractive game, and the various little visual effects are pretty sweet for when it came out. The art style is very dark, which fits the story to a ""T."" The various NPCs you interact with are all interesting, if 2-dimensional. Maybe if I'd played the first one, I'd be more invested in them. The learning curve is pretty much ideal. The tutorial is a mite frustrating, considering that you don't have any agency over what you can do when, but that's just me. Otherwise, the skills take long enough to grab that you become practiced at using each of them before you grab a new one. The enemy's AI is pretty damn solid, I gotta say. Good use of cover, suppressing fire, and even flanking actions. It surprised me quite a few times. The gameplay is where this game REALLY shines. Right in the first 10 minutes of the game, you're using your two tentacle beasts to wreak havoc and MAN it's fun. The right tentacle beast looks like it's kinda more fragile, and has massive friggin' fangs. Accordingly, this is the one you use to slash people up and whip 'em to death. This simple tentacle whip remains a valid strategy right up until the very last fight. The left tentacle is more muscle-y, and is definitely my favorite of the two. With it, you can grab various bits of scenery and chuck 'em around at high speed, with a generous auto-target. And not just blunt trauma. You can cut blokes in half with car doors and fans, impale them with bits of pipe, or even bludgeon them with bits and pieces of their dead buddies. Loads of fun. The game affords you a generous armament, but you really don't want to use them for kills, as a bullet kill nets you a lousy 10 essence.     I haven't even gotten to the skill tree yet! Each kill you get and action you take gives you ""essence"" which basically functions as xp. 20 essence for impaling a guy, 30 for ripping him in half lengthwise, 30 for ripping out his intestines through his♥♥♥♥♥♥ etc. The fights are frantic enough, and your body count high enough, that you can amass massive amounts of essence relatively quickly.  The skills themselves are high in cost, especially the top-tier ones, but some of them are absolutely absurd. I picked up one near the end that let me harvest miniature black holes from dead bodies and throw them. How awesome is that?The music was good. No complaints there. There were some bits in cutscenes that gave me the friggin' heebie-jeebies, all because of the music. So, all told, I'd definitely recommend this. Even if you're not super invested in the plot, it's fun as hell.My Scores:Graphics: 8/10Learning Curve: 10/10AI: 10/10Gameplay: 10/10Music: 9/10Overall: 47/50			"

												If you enjoy quite literally ripping into your foes then you'll love this game.  The Darkness' powers are well designed, allowing you to easily use them while using your firearms rather than requiring you to switching back and forth.  The basics of gameplay are -- and remain -- simple, giving you tougher, better protected and more numerous obstacles rather than expecting you to memorize dozens of specific-use powers.  Even better, the cooldowns on major abilities are reasonable and there's no annoying MP/SP systems.  No ""saving it for when I REALLY need it"" here.  Go wild and give your enemies a new, bettter reason to fear the dark (if only for the last few seconds of their life).  Hell, you can feasibly go through the whole game without ever using the guns to fight.  I know I certainly had much more fun ripping and slashing and impaling and decapitating everyone in sight with every object in sight than traditional ""shoot, run forward, shoot"" could have delivered.

												(Single player only review)Based on a comic book I never read, The Darkness II puts you as Jackie, a mafioso crime boss who is a host for a supernatural evil entity called ""The Darkness"". The Darkness grants you superpowers, the most obvious being two long snake-like demon arms, which among other things act as a powerful melee weapon. The downside is that The Darkness is deceiving and manipulative and will slowly consume it's host the more it is let loose. The theme and atmosphere is best described as a mix of a gangster movie with a solid dose of horror and splatter. Things get very brutal and gory, but the slightly cell-shaded graphics gives it a comic book look, which takes the edge of it all. Some of the characters you come across have a ton of personality, perfectly conveyed by top-notch voice acting  and brilliant over-the-top motion-captured gestures/body language.The sound and graphics are very good, but the sub par level of geometry detail shows it's console heritage and never pushes the 3d-engine hard enough to drop a single frame on my Geforce 780 with everything maxed.The story itself (spoiler alert) has two main plot lines: Someone is after you, because they want The Darkness, and you are haunted by recurring nightmares/hallucinations about your dead love which leads you to believe that perhaps she is still somehow to be saved.Normally I get easily bored with long winded mediocre story telling in video games, but I found the story, albeit perhaps trivial in nature, to be thoroughly entertaining, in part due to the excellent delivery.The core gameplay is fairly standard, linear, but very solid FPS in a generally confined level design. It does however feature 4 skill trees which will definitely help skew the gameplay in the direction you prefer:-Gun upgrades (clip sizes and permanent damage bonuses)-Demon arm execution bonuses-Demon arm melee upgrades (they can also grab and throw objects and enemies)-Upgrades to Swarm (a plague-like insect swarm that will stun and hurt your enemies) and Gun Channeling (a short period where you get various gun related boosts)You have 4 gun slots, and you can dual-wield.You purchase new skills by spending ""Essence"", which is earned mainly by killing enemies, preferably by having you demon arms executing them in a horrific ways, and finding artifacts. Having your demon arms eat the hearts of the corpses will also give you some essence in addition to a health boost. Health regenerates up to the nearest 25% level when you haven't been hurt in a while.The A.I. was decent, and I didn't encounter any bugs worth mentioning.Other mentionable features:- Light. The Darkness doesn't like the light, and exposure to it means the demon arms will retract and you lose all your super powers until you are in the dark again. Light will also visually blind you by distorting the display thus handicapping your aim. Later on in the campaign you'll encounter foes with powerful flashlights and light grenades. As I generally dislike enemy attacks that handicaps/restricts you I found this aspect of the gameplay a little too annoying at times.So make sure to find and eliminate all destructable light sources in an area before you engage your enemies.- A sidekick midget demon with a cockney accent. You'll get to control him a couple of times during the campaign, which are stealthy missions. In his standard form he does little but occasionally distract some of your foes leaving them essentially stunned and open for your attack. But there's a talent in the skill tree that'll enable him to actually kill foes.Other than that he does little but urinate and fart on the corpses you produce, and wisely telling you to avoid the light while constantly referring to you as ""monkey"" (yup, it gets annoying). Fortunately he doesn't like the light either, so you can always throw him into the spotlight for some relief.Bottom line - 6 hours of linear, stylish, satisfying FPS action with a brilliantly delivered horrific story and theme. 80%			"

												Aren't these the guys who developed Unreal and Unreal Tournament? I know of no other Digital Extremes. Beside them you also have 2K so you really have everything you need to make a really good game.I never played the first one as it was never released on PC. But from what I understand the story takes place a couple of years after the events of its predecessor. You play the don of an infamous crime family who is attacked at the beginning of the story. One of the rival gangs almost eliminates Jackie, our protagonist, who eventually gives in to the Darkness which saves his life.And this is where the game gets interesting: Jackie has two tentacles protruding from his body and you can use them to crush, dismember or simply slice up your enemies. Oh, and of course you have your good old pistols, machine guns and shotguns to annihilate all the bad guys approaching you. Jackie did not want the Darkness to return - under the circumstances, however, he needs to rely on them and throughout the game you need to find out who and why attacked you in the restaurant.With the tentacles you can also pick up objects - e.g. the door of a vehicle - and throw them at your enemies. And as you can do some dual wielding with the firearms you can practically say you are doing quad wielding with the two tendrils. How cooler can a game be, am I right? With the killings you can collect what the game calls essence; a substance that eventually lets you purchase new powers or the upgraded version of the ones you already have. It should also be note that as the title refers to it darkness is also Jackie's ally - if you are in an illuminated area the tentacles immediately retract.Darkness II is a fast-paced action horror game that utilises a cel-shading technique to give the game a comic book influenced visual style. Multiplayer is limited to cooperative gameplay that does not really add anything to the story but lets you enjoy quad wielding with your friends.I highly recommend it - for 30 EUR it's a bit too much at the moment but you should definitely pick this one up if discounted.

												This review is written after one playthrough of the main game, and one playthrough of the co-op campaign (allthough I did it by my lonesome). Boht on mobster (medium) difficulty)The story is my opinion very well written and exciting, allthough linear and short. The gameplay was fast paced and exciting. I was worried the two extra ""arms"" would be hard to use, but using a gamepad it quickly started feeling natural, and the controls all in all worked very well, and were easy to learn. The key to victory in combat is combining firearms and darkness powers (some learned through the skilltree), and it's easy to learn - and honestly not particularly hard to master either. That's not to say it's a particularly easy game though, even though your darkness powers allows you to tear through some parts of the game.The co-op campaign has a story that runs next to the story of the main campaign, focusing on 4 mercenaries hired by the ""protagonist"", Jackie Estacado, to shoot people, fetch stuff, shoot people, rescue hostages and occasionally shoot people. Each of the 4 mercs have access to parts of the Darkness' powers (like regeneration, super helpsome), and they each have an unique weapon as well as an unique skilltree. The co-op campaign is even shorter than the main game, the map-design isn't as exciting, but designed for bigger battles. I played through it alone, so I don't know how well it works with more players,  but I found it entertaining enough, even though the difficulty varied wildly, allthough I think that may have been because I was alone.The graphics are pleasing, and made in a comic-y style, which also makes the constant gore a little less realistic, making the game feel a bit less graphic than I had expected. The animation is for the most parts good, though some characters feel a bit stiff. The quality of the voice work varies a bit, but is for the most parts good - the screams of terror from the enemies seem convincing and such.All in all I think this is a good game with fair graphics, it is however quite short. The current price, 30 euro, is a bit more than I feel it's worth. Catch it on sale some time, and tear up some gangsters and♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

And the ending,  which I indicated before.Overall, I loved this game and had a lot of fun with it, but I really want to see a Darkness 3 so they can finish the story properly.Another problem I had with the game is that vendetta did not work, everytime my friend tried to join the game would crash.

												So I have owned this game for a while and only just got around to even installing it. I received it as part of a humble bundle so I wrote it off as a ""Play Later"" game. I finally played it and while short I can honestly say that I enjoyed my time with it. I finished the main campaign in about 4.5 hours and played a little bit of the coop mode, which you can thankfully play offline as well. The game looks decent, but the art style may put off some. So overall I would say The Darkness 2 is worth the short time, but only on sale on steam or somewhere else. Do not buy this for 29.99 or you will feel ripped off because it is fairly short.			"

												(Single player only review)Based on a comic book I never read, The Darkness II puts you as Jackie, a mafioso crime boss who is a host for a supernatural evil entity called ""The Darkness"". The Darkness grants you superpowers, the most obvious being two long snake-like demon arms, which among other things act as a powerful melee weapon. The downside is that The Darkness is deceiving and manipulative and will slowly consume it's host the more it is let loose. The theme and atmosphere is best described as a mix of a gangster movie with a solid dose of horror and splatter. Things get very brutal and gory, but the slightly cell-shaded graphics gives it a comic book look, which takes the edge of it all. Some of the characters you come across have a ton of personality, perfectly conveyed by top-notch voice acting  and brilliant over-the-top motion-captured gestures/body language.The sound and graphics are very good, but the sub par level of geometry detail shows it's console heritage and never pushes the 3d-engine hard enough to drop a single frame on my Geforce 780 with everything maxed.The story itself (spoiler alert) has two main plot lines: Someone is after you, because they want The Darkness, and you are haunted by recurring nightmares/hallucinations about your dead love which leads you to believe that perhaps she is still somehow to be saved.Normally I get easily bored with long winded mediocre story telling in video games, but I found the story, albeit perhaps trivial in nature, to be thoroughly entertaining, in part due to the excellent delivery.The core gameplay is fairly standard, linear, but very solid FPS in a generally confined level design. It does however feature 4 skill trees which will definitely help skew the gameplay in the direction you prefer:-Gun upgrades (clip sizes and permanent damage bonuses)-Demon arm execution bonuses-Demon arm melee upgrades (they can also grab and throw objects and enemies)-Upgrades to Swarm (a plague-like insect swarm that will stun and hurt your enemies) and Gun Channeling (a short period where you get various gun related boosts)You have 4 gun slots, and you can dual-wield.You purchase new skills by spending ""Essence"", which is earned mainly by killing enemies, preferably by having you demon arms executing them in a horrific ways, and finding artifacts. Having your demon arms eat the hearts of the corpses will also give you some essence in addition to a health boost. Health regenerates up to the nearest 25% level when you haven't been hurt in a while.The A.I. was decent, and I didn't encounter any bugs worth mentioning.Other mentionable features:- Light. The Darkness doesn't like the light, and exposure to it means the demon arms will retract and you lose all your super powers until you are in the dark again. Light will also visually blind you by distorting the display thus handicapping your aim. Later on in the campaign you'll encounter foes with powerful flashlights and light grenades. As I generally dislike enemy attacks that handicaps/restricts you I found this aspect of the gameplay a little too annoying at times.So make sure to find and eliminate all destructable light sources in an area before you engage your enemies.- A sidekick midget demon with a cockney accent. You'll get to control him a couple of times during the campaign, which are stealthy missions. In his standard form he does little but occasionally distract some of your foes leaving them essentially stunned and open for your attack. But there's a talent in the skill tree that'll enable him to actually kill foes.Other than that he does little but urinate and fart on the corpses you produce, and wisely telling you to avoid the light while constantly referring to you as ""monkey"" (yup, it gets annoying). Fortunately he doesn't like the light either, so you can always throw him into the spotlight for some relief.Bottom line - 6 hours of linear, stylish, satisfying FPS action with a brilliantly delivered horrific story and theme. 80%			"

												So I have owned this game for a while and only just got around to even installing it. I received it as part of a humble bundle so I wrote it off as a ""Play Later"" game. I finally played it and while short I can honestly say that I enjoyed my time with it. I finished the main campaign in about 4.5 hours and played a little bit of the coop mode, which you can thankfully play offline as well. The game looks decent, but the art style may put off some. So overall I would say The Darkness 2 is worth the short time, but only on sale on steam or somewhere else. Do not buy this for 29.99 or you will feel ripped off because it is fairly short.			"

												This game is honestly a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of fun. I really like the story, gameplay, just everything about it. The only think I dislike, however, is the game's ending(s). It's really unfortunate a game like ""The Darkness""(First game of series) is only on console, I would have loved to play it on PC. Another the chances of there being a 3rd one for this series is low, which really sucks. The ending is SO unsatisfying and leaves you wondering. The co-op campaign is really cool because it relates/connects to the single-player story. It sucks that it's also fairly dead, however if you have friends that have this game. It's REALLY fun. I rate this game a 9/10. It would of gotten higher if it had a better ending, the game was kind of short but it was still fun.			"

												So yeah i have played this game before non steam, and i got it here as well on sale.Keep in mind i have played the first The Darkness as well.Positives:- Great combat, with a bit of a spin from classic fps games by including the demon arms.- Amazing storyline! (Even if you havent played the first one it explains it self pretty well).- Great unique graphics. Kinda comic-y/cartoonish but realistic enough,an excelent blend.- Doesn't get boring.Negatives:-Very short. It took me 6.8 hours to complete the whole game while searching for the ""secret relics"" in each chapter as well.(But i guess that's why its not boring,because it moves fast enough,not keeping you in the same place for too long).8/10The current stock price is a bit high.Definitely recommend this on a sale!

If you're looking for a game that's dark and has that graphic novel-esque look, look no further than The Darkness II. I'm honestly kinda sad there was no DLC made specifically for this game for the duration of its release, despite there being a DLC option in the menus. This is just begging for a sequel.

Let's say , the entire chapter is your playground.-Well -made NPCs , your allies have a lot of dialogues to say to you , among your progression through the storyline. Feel free to talk to them.-Very nice voice acting. Italiano....-Deep and unique storytelling.-Jenny ? (You there ??)-Evil monkey as your companion.Cons-Campaign is a bit short but yet  longer than COD : Ghost (At least)One of the most  underrated game from 2012 , grab it if you have a chance !8.5 / 10 "

												The Darkness is a pretty standard shooter with a little superpowers thrown in for good measure. The single-player is fairly well balanced if a little on the easy side even on the harder difficulties. The story is surprisingly decent and grey and gritty enough that you won't feel like vomiting too often.The premise is simple enough. There is this thing, a being of pure evil, called The Darkness. It can't interact directly with our world so it needs to attach itself to a human being giving that individual incredible powers as well as slowly corrupting that person. You play as Jackie who's family is tied to the Darkness is some way that was probably explained in the detail in the first game, you have the Darkness inside you but somehow managed to contain it, until a weird old guy who knows a little bit of magic himself shows up and tries to kill you and everybody you know. You quickly abandon logic, unleash the Darkness and go on a killing spree.The game plays out as a standard shooter most of the time with a few added elements, as the wielder of the Darkness you have two big snake like creatures growing out your body that can be used to hit things, grab things and eat things. You are also handicapped by being vulnerable to light. While a shooter with superpowers isn't exactly a new thing it plays fairly well, the combat is fluid as are the transitions between shooting at people and slashing them with your pet snakes.The storyline is, much to my surprise, fairly well written and while not given you much choice it does ask a number of questions about morality and reality. The ending in particular will be a surprise to most players. In addition there is a decent amount of lore and back story available to those that seek it.It all has one major flaw however, it's length. Even playing the game to 100% completion, which requires at least two playthroughs of the main campaign as well as playing through a number of multi-player mini-campaigns will only take you a little over 10-12 hours and that is quite simply unacceptable for a game that was originally marketed with a full 50$ price tag.The graphic style is generally a bit cartoonish which contrasts heavily with the stark and grim story and gameplay.All in all The Darkness 2 is a decent enough play, and some good fun with a couple of friends. It is however not a game you should ever contemplate buying at full price simply because of it's extremely short lifespan.			"

												Great game! Many improvements over the first game, such as allowing you to use the darkness to attack enemies. The ability to upgrade and gain new abilities is a good idea. The story is very good and does the comic book justice. Though if you are into the comic book and playing the games then you will see many differences. I will not list them here as they could be spoilers for others, not that its a bad thing it just gets you thinking. Hopefully there will be a third game, though hopefully we will see a longer campaign, from the ending of this one hopefully we will be able to see more of the comic book come to live in the next game espcailly if they use matrial from the rebirth storyline... if there will be a next game of course.

												The Darkness II is a hidden gem of film noir in color. Not that it's good or not-bad, just unpopular.You play as Jackie, an twenty-something who tries to avenge and save his girlfriend (?) Jenny. Other than that, I honestly cannot tell you what happens, it's just a sloppy and boring story. The game heavily relies on staying in the darkness/shade as the title implies. Jackie is infested with some sort of demonic being that ""helps"" him in finding Jenny. The demon can only manifest itself in the dark during which you can have many special skills and abilities involving guns and long tentacles. These abilities are used to kill various out-of-this-world devilish foes. I would say that it's a FPS run and gun by all means with a very creepy story.It's a very unique game by all means.The only problem I can really say is the shortness. You can finish this game in about 3 hour's time. That's very steep for a $30 price tag.The Darkness II runs very well on my PC too, the best of any large game I've tried. It's extremely smooth. Autoaim is always enabled, which may be annoying or a godsend however way you look at it.Obligatory score: 7/10			"

												In general a very enjoyable game. Not going to lie, it has a few kinks I hope they fix for Darkness III (oh please let it happen), but those are easy to look past considering all the other great parts of the game.Good things:The story about Jenny is fantastic (minor spoiler, yes she's in the game a bit). It really got me sucked into it all because alot of very logical things surfaced when playing, which gave a rather interresting perspective about the game itself.The gore...I mean come on you have to love it. Actually one of the most brutal games I've ever played, but at the same time not the most graphic one. The artstyle makes you enjoy it alot more than get grossed out by it.The artstyle I can't explain why but I really like it. It has a comic noir sense to it and looks really good.The gameplay has a really nice touch to it. Demons and guns, how do you say no to that? Also there's a skilltree you level up depending on how you want to play, so personalized customization for you and your abilities.Finally you can tell that the developers have put alot of time and effort into the game because of all the amazing voiceacting. If you feel like it you can double your gameplay time by talking to everyone possible and not only get alot of info about what's going on and personal opinions which add alot of depth to the story, you can also enjoy a comedic side to this game which I personally was happily surprised to discover.Things that can be improved:First thing that comes to mind is the amount of execution animations. Though horrendous and incredible great to watch, they get quite repetitive once you've played for a while. For the next game I wish they mix it up a bit and expand the ways you can kill people with your demons, because, and be honest to yourself, that is one of the coolest things about this game.Secondly I really enjoyed the story and the campaign and it all had a nice flow all the way through. I just wish for the flow to extend another few hours. I finished the game in about ten hours or so, and I really think a game should be longer than that. Especially since this one doesn't have free roaming and maybe not so much replay value since the story is such a big part of the game.Overall I give this game 8.5/10. Get it and enjoy this very unique FPS where YOU are the nightmare everyone fears ;)			"

												Darkness II is one of these games that have many advantages as a game but many drawbacks , too.The graphcis are unusually good (cell-shaded), but the music-soundtrack is uninteresting.The single player is awsome , interesting story , good and solid FPS mechanics , and a awesome skilltree(which give you the ability to unlock both passives and active skills and ofcourse improvments to them).After finishing the single player campaign you can start again a NG++ which means you will keep the unlocked skills you already have from the previous campaign , I personally found it pretty awesome and I had a totally different experience from the 1st playthrough.Except from the campaign single player, the game also gives you the opportunity to play some side missions (which are called vendettas), with 4 new characters each one with his own skilltree and abilities , and a  extra small campaignin which is basically the sum up of the vendettas (or the opposite) .Furthemore some vendettas can be completed with multiplayer co-op. The major drawback is that the main campaign will only last for 5 hours tops (it took me 8 hours with a NG++ game) ,and the vendettas will give you 2-3 more hours.If you decide ofcourse to play the extra campaign or the vendettas with all the charactes (I doubt you will :P ), the time will be multiplied.So here comes the critical question : Are you able/willing to give 30 $ for a game it will only last 12-14 hours tops?Yes the story will be great and Yes the powers and abilities of darkness will be unforgetable but will it worth for the so little time it will last....?In my opinion NO ...buy this game like a did at a steam sale (80%=5$) and you will not regret it.

												Very cool story and characters with fun fps gameplay. My only problem with the game is the bullet sponge enemies towards the end of the game that are very annoying to fight because it takes more then 10 headshots to bring them down. I also often found myself running out of ammo in a lot of situations it breaks the fast paced flow of the shooting because you are constantly looking for more ammo and looking at the ground for a weapon to switch it can get pretty frustrating expecially on the harder difficulties. The game is short and linear but it works in it's favour, its well handled.8/10 (Great)			"

												NOTE: Despite my short playing time, I have in fact completed this game. I also own a copy on Xbox 360, and this is the copy I completed. The Darkness II is a phsycological horror first-person shooter sequel to The Darkness, a console only game released back in 2009. The original game was interesting despite its flaws, and was a highly enjoyable game in terms of story and gameplay. Its sequel, The Darkness II, goes above and beyond to deliver an absolute gem of a gaming experience, and a masterpiece of the art form. You play as Jackie Estacado, the head of a feared crime family, who is the host to an ancient evil known as The Darkness - this evil resides inside Jackie and gives him supernatural powers. Jackie constantly wrestles for control, and The Darkness forced him to stand by and watch as his girlfriend, Jenny, was murdered. Jenny's murder is the driving force of this entire game. Throughout the game, Jackie experiences hallucinations of Jenny, and interacts with her as she if she never died. These moments are the soul of the game; Jackie and Jenny are beautifully acted, and you can genuinely feel the emotion in these scenes. This made the story a compelling and enjoyable one, and I felt personally compellled to stick this game through to the end.In between cutscenes and interaction with Jenny and other NPC's, Jackie will engage in numerous combat situations. This game uses a unique and innovative combat system, in that the player is able to 'quad-wield'; the player is able to dual wield one handed firearms in combination with the demon tendrils produced by The Darkness. These tendrils let you rip, slash, throw, tear and stab your enemies in a variety of highly entertaining ways, but be warned that these kills are extremely gory and not for the faint hearted. In fact, the entire game is extremely dark, and contains very dark subject matter beyond the usual video game. The player also has to avoid street lights and other artificial lights and shoot them out where possible, as you cannot regenerate health or use Darkness abilities whilst in the light.This game is beautiful in every aspect. The game engine employs a distinct comic-book inspired aesthetic like the Borderlands games, and it really helps make the game look and run nice at the higher settings. Substantial effort and polish has gone into the production of this game, and it really shows; character models look and move realistically, and environments are dazzling to look at.In addition to the perfected single player campaign (which I have been careful not to spoil) there is a mini co-op campaign, which allows you to play with 3 friends and use a wide range of guns and abilities to kill enemies. This mode emphasises fun and action, and lacks the depth of the single player campaign. However, it was certainly fun, and I didn't feel like it detracted from the campaign in any way.Overall, The Darkness II is a masterpiece of the gaming industry. A brilliant, well constructed tale of love and loss and eventually redemption, this is a game for the ages. I can't recommend it any more than I already have, which is why this game earns a 10 / 10.			"

												So I picked this game up for $1 on humblebundle.com along with Duke Nukem: Forever and Spec Ops: The Line. I looked at the screenshots and I thought, eh it's just going to be another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ alien shooter. Boy was I wrong. (Keep in mind I haven't played the first game) So I'll start with the story. Basically you are Jackie Estacado, the leader of a crime family and mob. You start by getting attacked by another crime mob and your 'darkness' is released from within yourself after having kept it in for so long. You then set out to find who put the attackers up to attacking you. All the while having the darkness for show. People called it 'the thing' or sometimes nicknamed him monkey. With him having released the darkness; it comes with side effects. One of the big ones is hallucinations. Seeing things that aren't there. Jackie had the repetitive hallucination of seeing his dead girlfriend: Jennie/Jenny. Whenever he went to some places the darkness would kick in and show Jennie walking around with him. Jackie not wanting to believe she was dead went along with it and every time was baffaled when she dissapeared. Jackie had a sidekick with him. The 'Darkling'. It was a small monkey like creature with a very Cockney accent. It couldn't be touched by light or it'd die. When you had the darkness on show, you couldn't be in the light either or it'd significantly weaken you. As you proceed with the story you find out that the people who put the attackers up to the attack was 'The Brotherhood' ; led by Victor Valente. They wanted you so they could get the darkness from you. There was only two ways they could get The Darkness from you. 1. By Jackie giving it up by choice. 2. By using the ancient relic: The Siphon. Now Jackie didn't want to give the darkness up because he was led to believe that Jennie's soul was trapped within hell and as long as he had the darkness he could save her. However the Brotherhood eventually trapped Jackie and stole the Darkness via the use of the Siphon. You track Victor down and fight him with what little of the darkness is left and what you steal from one of his minions. Once you kill him, you stab yourself with the Siphon and descend down into the depths of hell. Once in hell you run through trying to find Jennie. Once you find her you use your darkness powers to release her from her shackles (I can't think of the word). However he was being decieved all along. It wasn't Jennie he just released: it was  The Angelus  . The Angelus was the keeper of light. Legend has it The Angelus and The Darkness have fought for eternity. Now I did miss out one part of the story because I didn't know where to fit it in but it was that at points throughout the game where the Darkness was healing Jackie; Jackie actually fell into a dream state which was 'the hospital'. Here the darkness tried to convince him that his crime life was all a dream and he is in the hospital to get better. The Darkling manages to prove that it isn't real and helps him along. My Opinions I have to say I was very impressed. The characters were constructed very well. It made you feel like Jackie did. Going through 2 different worlds; you didn't know what was real or not. It was also a great mind twister. Throughtout the story making sense of things was hard. Which is real? Which isn't? That can't be true? Can it? However towards the end of the story everything tied together and everything made perfect sense. I'd like to say a big well done to the developers. I thoroughly enjoyed this game although it was quite short. Scores Graphics: 7/10Gameplay: 8/10Storyline: 8/10Value for money: 6/10Overall: 29/40			"

												As a fan of the original The Darkness, let me say this....the game is a huge downgrade compared to the first. That doesn't make this a bad game, but coming from the first one, this isn't as fun. The art style has been changed to be more like the comics, which is fine, but the realistic art style of the original was one of the reasons it was popular. It was gory and gritty. The executions in the first game were way better. The demon arms were much cooler. They'd growl at you, etc. I dunno, I played it for a few minutes. It's okay. I doubt I'll touch it again. It's much more linear than the original. A lot easier. A lot less core features, with a lot of dumb upgrade features thrown ontop.			"

												I really like this game, a lot! From the visual graphic novel style graphics, to the gun and tentacle toting game-play to the stereotyped mob characters. This game isn't perfect but it's a hell of a lot of fun. The story is deep enough to keep you interested, the characters are just deep enough for you to actually like this, the environments are nicely varied but the game play is it's strong point with unique ""quad wielding"" combat.All in all everything adds up to a game that I will certainly remember.

												I'll start by saying i really enjoyed the first Darkness game. The story was really well done and the game had an atmoshpere of darkness and despair that really matched it. While this sequel is a decent game it didn't quite live up to it's predecessor for me. First of all the game's cel-shaded looking visuals while not bad looking, just didn't seem to fit with this game. What should be quite a dark game ends up looking cartoony and it just isn't the right fit. It also makes the game feel a bit more arcadey instead of the visceral feel the gameplay of the first game had. The story while interesting didn't reall captivate me as much as in the first game either and Jackie is also less likeable (though you could argue this might be to reflect the effect of the experiences in the first game on him.)The gameplay and combat isn't too bad. There's a bit more variety with combat in this game and your darkling follower can be quite useful and adds a bit of comical relief. There's also more variety with enemies which require different strategies to deal with.Overall all it's a decent game but nowhere near as good as it's predecessor. If you enjoyed the first game i'd say maybe give this one a go if you can pick it up cheap but but be prepared for the fact that it's not as good. If you didn't like the first you probably won't like this either. It's a 6/10 for me. "

												To start with, this game took me about 18 hours to get all the achievements and complete it in 100%.These hours were one of the best hours I've spent playing games, even though basic storyline took me 7 hours to complete while taking my time and not skipping any dialogues, the fun that this game gives fully recompensates it's shortness.The storyline is just nearly perfect, at certain moment player just gets a mind♥♥♥♥ and doesn't know what to believe ( i don't wanna spoiler, but that game got one of the best endings I've ever seen) . Combat system in this game may look pretty chaotic from the beggining, but later everyone should get used to it and just concentrate on the joy that this game brings, especially if you like gore - if you really do, you are gonna just masturbate to the executions and finishers that The Darkness 2 offers you :)Only disandvantage is difficulty level, after completing full game on the normal difficulty I've started NG+ on the Don difficulty ( highest available) and died only about 10 times through the whole game ( perks that have lasted from the previous game surely made it easier, but when im choosing highest difficulty possible I'm expecting something really hardcore), in overall if you can aim to the head - the game get's easy. Music seems to be okay, but it's nothing special in my opinion - unlike dialogues that are just ♥♥♥♥in' brilliant. The Darkness 2 gets 9/10 from me, and the prequel is surely going to be the first game that i will play if i ever buy a console.			"

												Not a long game, but it packs way more story, character development and action in it's 8 or so hours than most games do in twice that. Everything this game does it does almost perfectly - the combat, the dialog and story, the art style, the voice acting. All of it was superb. I didn't notice any glitches or bad gameplay elements. The included co-op maps are interesting, even if played solo.  While they do become a bit repetitive, they present a slightly different combat experience from the main game and are worth running through. In short, the whole game was just a blast to play.			"

												The Darkeness II is not perfect. But I think its flaws dont outweigh what I like, so here we are. I would reccomend the game on sale, as it is wont to go because the combat is fast paced and fun. Sometimes theres a little too little ammo, and especially when enemies can disable your darkness powers this makes some areas a bit too hard, but the combat is fun, fast and brutal. The guns are tight, the darkness controls well, and the cell-shaded look is pretty good looking, especially considering this is based off of a comic book, as well as allowing some odd character desgin, like victor. The villians are vile, and normally I would say this is an attempt to make jackie seem like the better guy-and to a large degree thats true, but the game also never really pretends jackies perfect, so its not as obnoxious as it normally is. The story is ok, not great but not awful, and after reading some of the comic book plot summary, the veering away seems like a good choice. Everything is pretty solid, though I think they could have expanded the story and world a bit more and it would've fleshed it out a bit more.  Perhaps they couldve, but this games biggest problem probably had something to do with that-length. The game is just too damn short, and considering I enjoyed that it makes me sad that this was the case. The length is not ok, the FOV needs to be adjustable-this game is best on PC for the number of buttons that you use in combat, and not having a more adjustable FOV is unnacceptable. Also on PC, there are still bugs that don't let you get through certain areas unless you turn on Vsync, which makes the game look blurry if you leave it on by accident. Thats not ok, escpecially in this day and age of patching. The co-op is enjoyable, though the characters are all flat stereotypes, and  I can understand accusations of racism, though  I chalk it up to laziness more than anything. Still its a fun game, and I would highly reccomend it, though it may make you sad when you beat it to realize they may not make another one, considering the silence around it. Fingers crossed they do.			"

												A superbly-designed game with a touching story. It appeals to me both as a game and as a piece of art. The  gameplay is as fluid as can be, with great gunplay and supernatural powers courtesy of the demonically mystical ""Darkness"". There are  twists and turns throughout, both heart-warming and devastating.I thoroughly enjoyed this game, and it takes it's place among the few games  that I've finished on the same day; that may be a result of the story being short, but no shorter than the average single player of today, and not so long it drags things out.With New Game + and ""Vendettas"" which I believe to be extra missions, there is still plenty of replayability. Hell, I'm going to replay it just for the story.8/10 - A must buy.			"

												Loved the game lots! The story was strong and really made me want to play more and cant wait for a new Darkness to come out. The ending...the ending is a troll if you have finished the game you would agree 100 percent. My only complaint is it was really short. Like really short. It only took 5 hours to play through story and thats with seeing all the cut scenes and not skipping any conversations. That would be my only negitive comment really. Strong story line, strong characters, pretty good graphics and the little minion who helps you, is accually helpful. Hard to find a game that has one of those sometimes. Anyway i would give this game a 8/10 overall. i wish the game was longer but if you get a chance you should definently try this game out!			"

												A very good game with excellent fighting mechanics, The Darkness II is a very good game. A decent story, although not the best around, is also a huge part of this amazing game. The power that is given to you almost makes you feel invincible, but doesn’t take away from the challenge. Although I will admit that this game is not very long, giving you maybe 6 hours of game play on the single player campaign tops, and the fact that there isn’t much of a reason to replay the single player again unless you want to use the amazing abilities you gain. But to counter that statement, if you have another friend that can get this game, there is a very decent coop experience with new characters with new abilities to play with, giving the game a lot more hours of fun to experience. It’s a decent game and its very fun, although probably not worth the 30$ price tag, this game is still a must own, and if you can find it on sale for $10~$15 or less, you should definitely get this game.

												This game is pretty good, but very short.  There are vendettas and multiplayer, which I haven't touched yet (and probably won't), but the single player campaign is about a 6 hour experience.  The good news is that it's a very fun and worthwhile experience.  Really fun combat, good enough upgrade system (the abilities you get are pretty fun).  The execution system also makes the gameplay interesting and fun.  The story is good (I've never read the comic).  However, I personally wouldn't play full price.  But it is a very good pick up when on sale.			"

												There's not much I can say about this game. Basically, it's good. Action is good, sound design is good, plot and story are both at a very high level. It's enjoyable to play. Some minuses are here, though. Such as: it's short as ♥♥♥♥. You barely get used to your skills, and then - pow, ha-ha. It's over.A lot of meaningless charaters. Why should I give a ♥♥♥♥ about some lady thoughts and advices, if I barely see her throughout the gameplay? I can't get it.Still, if I had to rate it from 1 to 10, where 1 means Dota 2, and 10 - TLoU, it would take place somewhere around 6-7. Definetely worth buying with a discount, definetely not worth it's full price. Thank you.			"

												Well I beat it. And it's okay. Story is nice. Still hate Adam Sandler movies, so this game didn't change my mind about the actor. I just feel that he plays as the same character in every film. He's a wierd guy, who pisses someone off, finds a girl, beats some people up, and then him and his girl seperate and he goes off somewhere, but then he comes back to her and they get back together and they fall in love. In every Adam Sandler movie this happens. I swear to god. The movies he plays in have awful plot lines, and the jokes are very mediocre. This game is fine though, but it does not live up to the developers words, because they specefically said that it makes Adam Sandler look cool again. That was their slogan for the game, and the soul reason I purchased the game as well, and it never lived up to it! It is fun, but as a warning; it will not make Adam Sandler look cool.			"

												Fun gory game. Not better than the first Darkness, but still holds out quite good.The story is great, so is the gameplay. Music, sound, voice acting... all excellent. The cartoon-like novel graphics aren't bad; reminds me a bit of Borderlands for the cel-shading, but The Darkness 2 doesn't have the same cel-shading. I'd say its more close to the real comic novel than the first Darkness.The only big con I can point out... the single player story mode is quite short. I took my sweet time and finished it in 6 hours and that wasn't the easiest difficulty mode, so I imagine on easy, you could finish the game quite faster!The CO-OP mode is interesting but not as good as the story mode. The good thing though, it can be played solo or with friends.OVERALL:If you really liked TD1, you will absolutely love TD2. Since this game is mainly focused for single player story mode, I would advice to wait it out and get the game on a nice sale.RATING:7.5 / 10			"

												Bought this game on humble bundle. Beat it in 4 hours which is not bad for $1 but for the time, this game must have been baaaad. The story is really short and the multiplier is lackluster. Ai is challenging mainly because they like to spam flashbangs which shakes the screen, makes everything black and white, and blinds you and deafens you and makes you not use your darkness powers. Story is meh, i just kept skipping just so I could get back to the combat, which is the main reason to play this game (it's possible to take out 3 enemies at the same time if you shoot at one, grab one with one tentacle, and slash the other with the other tentacle which is awesome)			"

												You may have detected a running theme here: that a lot of the elements of the first game were better or more tonally appropriate. That's true, and I think The Darkness II could have done well by paying a little more respect to its predecessor, but holy crap the combat is fantastic. Once you really get the feel of controlling four arms at once, you can pull off some really crazy stuff, and you feel like an absurd unstoppable powerhouse. Seriously, this is the most fun I've had with a combat system in any game, it's that excellent. Even if the first game was stronger in many ways, this one is worth playing solely for its awesome FPS combat.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2013/04/the-darkness-ii.html "

												I feel the Darkness!  Want the Darkness!  Honestly, it's a very good cell shaded type game.  It takes what looks like an old page out of a comic book and implements it into a cell shaded world.  Honestly the game does it well.  The levels have a pretty even split and playing as the Darkness is just plain fun.  Eating human hearts, decapitation, splitting the soul, and testing out an Iron Maiden.  Honestly, the game has only a couple of little flaws.  The story line is, ok.  It lacks a really epic story line, and it gets old somewhere in the middle and picks up again towards the end.  Gameplay is very good and the game requires you to learn to implement and even combination of darkness powers and gun totting.  If it's on sale I definitely recommend picking up a copy.  The game is good, and there aren't too many prevalent flaws.  Installation of the game went without a hitch.			"

												It's very rare I write reviews but this game deserves one... (Also spoiler alert at the end)Positives;+First up I will say I never played the first Darkness but luckily the game throws in a small cutscene to explain it+Gameplay runs smoothly with a nice difficult curve+Darkness powers are powerful, make you feel badass but aren't OP+Gunplay is smooth and consistent with a nice selection of weapons to use+Detail in graphics on each level is outstanding, You can see the designers have put a lot of effort into it+Dialogue is amusing but doesn't try too hard to entertain you+Nice little switch between Reality and a false reality which had me question which one is real at one point+Story is well thought out and enjoyableNow onto the negatives (since no game is perfect, Once again Spoiler alert at the end)-Some bugs when playing as the imp not being able to get through certain areas/gaps-Many enemies spam light grenades-The enemies that carry torches are annoying to kill and sometimes the light doesn't break-Quite a few graphical glitches during gameplay-Boss fights are a little easy-Melee attack occasionally misses it's target completelyOther than those bugs and annoyances I fully recommend this game and finally the spoiler""Snape kills Dumbledore""			"

												Not a long game, but it packs way more story, character development and action in it's 8 or so hours than most games do in twice that. Everything this game does it does almost perfectly - the combat, the dialog and story, the art style, the voice acting. All of it was superb. I didn't notice any glitches or bad gameplay elements. The included co-op maps are interesting, even if played solo.  While they do become a bit repetitive, they present a slightly different combat experience from the main game and are worth running through. In short, the whole game was just a blast to play.			"

												To start with, this game took me about 18 hours to get all the achievements and complete it in 100%.These hours were one of the best hours I've spent playing games, even though basic storyline took me 7 hours to complete while taking my time and not skipping any dialogues, the fun that this game gives fully recompensates it's shortness.The storyline is just nearly perfect, at certain moment player just gets a mind♥♥♥♥ and doesn't know what to believe ( i don't wanna spoiler, but that game got one of the best endings I've ever seen) . Combat system in this game may look pretty chaotic from the beggining, but later everyone should get used to it and just concentrate on the joy that this game brings, especially if you like gore - if you really do, you are gonna just masturbate to the executions and finishers that The Darkness 2 offers you :)Only disandvantage is difficulty level, after completing full game on the normal difficulty I've started NG+ on the Don difficulty ( highest available) and died only about 10 times through the whole game ( perks that have lasted from the previous game surely made it easier, but when im choosing highest difficulty possible I'm expecting something really hardcore), in overall if you can aim to the head - the game get's easy. Music seems to be okay, but it's nothing special in my opinion - unlike dialogues that are just ♥♥♥♥in' brilliant. The Darkness 2 gets 9/10 from me, and the prequel is surely going to be the first game that i will play if i ever buy a console.			"

												Well, this was an interesting game to play. A fresh air after playing so many crappy indie productions.Pros:- the plot is kind of nice if you know something about Image Comics and the Artifacts series - reading the story of hidden relics and immersing in the whole Darkness backstory is really fun- graphics are well fitting into comic book stylistics- playing with the Darkness tentacles is really fun- the whole concept of destroying light sources in order to be able to use the Darkness is an interesting idea, well fitting into the whole concept of the Darkness- character development system is not overwhelming the whole game - there is no point in maxing out character except for pure fun- some abilities give a lot of tactical advantages and possibilities - black holes can be of great help and autoaiming provided by one of high tier abilities, even while lasting about 5 seconds, can make the difference- last levels in hell are very nice and atmosphericCons:- the plot is kind of dumb if you're not into The Darkness comic books - Darkness says something, blablabla, Angelus blablabla, Brotherhood blablabla, vengance yadayada, Jenny hurrdurr, so on and so forth- you cannot skip some cutscenes - this is really bad- well, considering this is a shooter there aren't many different weapons - pistol, revolver, desert eagle, two different shotguns, winchester (you have it for about 15 minutes), two or three smgs, two or three different assault rifles and that's all- guns can use ammo really fast and there are not really that many ammo boxes laying around so you can find yourself in a situation where you don't have any bullets to shoot- I think that the games relies too much on the finisher mechanics - need to replenish health? Use Finisher #1. Need to get some additional ammo - guessed it, Finisher #2. Considering that uzis and other guns do use ammo pretty fast you may find yourself in a situation that you try to finish enemies with Finisher #1 or #2- special abilities are fun to use, but recharge slow and you don't really need them - they help, true, but they are not game changing abilities like for example slow motion in Max Payne 1.- this game is short (about 6-7 hours)As you can see I have described many cons so you may think that this is a mediocre game. By any means no, this is a really good game, I had a lot of fun playing it. There is New Game + option after beating the game, which adds some playtime if someone would like to go for the second run and max out character abilities. In the first run I think you can get 60-70% of all abilities so there is just enough reason to play the game for the second time. I just pass this option because I don't like to watch the same long cutscenes over again. Anyways... you can try Demo. Go and try it.---------- For anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/ "

												Well I beat it. And it's okay. Story is nice. Still hate Adam Sandler movies, so this game didn't change my mind about the actor. I just feel that he plays as the same character in every film. He's a wierd guy, who pisses someone off, finds a girl, beats some people up, and then him and his girl seperate and he goes off somewhere, but then he comes back to her and they get back together and they fall in love. In every Adam Sandler movie this happens. I swear to god. The movies he plays in have awful plot lines, and the jokes are very mediocre. This game is fine though, but it does not live up to the developers words, because they specefically said that it makes Adam Sandler look cool again. That was their slogan for the game, and the soul reason I purchased the game as well, and it never lived up to it! It is fun, but as a warning; it will not make Adam Sandler look cool.			"

												another great cel shading game from 2K :Drole as mob boss who possess the darkness made you unstopable. the combat mechanic is fun and easy just like modern arcade millitary shooter with special ability. the story is good enough ""less shoot, talk more"". like super heroes movie where the sequels mostly about lossing the ability, but it was too short gameplay. the voice actors also promissing specially for johnny powell voice. the multiplayer or ""vendetta"" is short either but worth to play cause it is part of the story and each character have different weapons and  skill trees (jackie got all their skills). too bad the first game not on PC :(.

												Had a really great time with the game, it was a bit short, but I didn't even pay attention to the story too much so it's not a complaint from my perspective.The gameplay is really fun and engaging with all the brutal things you can do with the tentacles, along with it being upgradable...this part of the game was definately my favorite.I couldn't really keep up with the story so I can't really comment on wether the endings are good or not (there are multiple, fyi) I was having too much fun with the combat to really listen to anything that was going on.I would wait for this game to be on sale (or relatively cheap compared to its $60 release cost) the game is great, but as I said earlier, it is surprisingly short.

												Very nice game, fun to play, very interactive and a very nice scenario. I got glued from the moment I started playing until I finished it. And even then, I restarted it because you can keep your player and continue to advance your darkness powers and play more challenging game difficulties. Also, some great additions like the challenge modes where you can use different characters, weapons and powers.			"

The storyline is simple and enjoyable with some really interesting and funny characters such as Darkling, Johnny. Gameplay is excellent, no complains here. You can tear very enemy with your demonic arms, throw all kind of items at them, also later you can get more abilities, like use swarm of insects or drop vortex that will suck all around it and slow motion headshot are awesome. Oh and The Darkness 2 is very gory.			"

												Pros:-Nice soundtrack-Cool gameplay-Coop campaign-Mike PattonCons:-Short durationThis game was way better than expected. I thought it'd be bad but it ended up being an amazing game. Though there are some features from the first game that don't appear in this one, there are new features which make up for that.The only negative aspect about this game is its duration, it took me about 17 hours to finish it twice (The first time in normal difficulty and the second one on the hardest one) and also finish the Vendetta campaign, and the hardest difficulty isn't that difficult.So... as I said before, this is a great game and even though it can be pretty short if you're fast and don't die much, it's definitely worth paying.

												Absolutely loved this game, the greatly story driven FPS with a search to find your beloved girlfriend was a great thrill to play through. I couldn't find myself to stop playing. As you go on through the game you find your ""Darkness"" to have a great impact on the story and changing the setting in great fashion, along side the monologue from Jackie Estacado after everything happens. The combat is also never a boring task as the game gives you multiple ways to either execute, mutilate or just shoot up your enemies. Anyways this game is fantastic and I can't believe it took me this long to play it.			"

												I have to say, it was a pretty good game, but it had flaws.  But it's not mindnumbing flaws.  Okay maybe one with the whole getting stuck in the vent, but still, I like the story, the characters, and while the graphics are more of the cartoony side, it is based off the comics.  So it makes sense.  It played well, and it has many cool things to do with two dark tenticles coming out of your back, and ripping your enemies to pieces.  Now, the flaws are that you can get stuck at certain parts in the game, which is weird how to fix it.  The story and gameplay is quite short.  It took me like 7 hours to beat it.  Not bad.  It can get boring after a while, because it's not really a huge variety of enemies.  The boss fights are not bad, and some are actually pretty cool.  And for the game to explore, it's very linear.  Not much to explore around the house, but you can chat with them.  Everything else outside, well, you can explore a bit to find the relics, but it's not hard to find.  It's just there, or in a corner somewhere.  I'm a bit ticked that I didn't get a single achievement during the whole play.  I even beat it, and it treats it like I wasn't playing it at all.  Stupid achievement system Steam has.  But I shouldn't let it bother me.  I've enjoyed the game, but I kind of recommend the first one more.  It's a little better, and it's much longer.  I still do recommend this game.  Get it when it's on sale or something.			"

												Frankly, with The Darkness II, I wasn't really expecting much. Probably just another demon fueled super action shooter right? Wrong. Well, right AND wrong. The Darkness II IS a kickass super action shooter, with a pretty compelling storyline to boot. I'm not saying this is some amazing story that will blow your mind, but I literally beat the game in two sittings (Each being about 3 hours-ish, so yes the game isn't very long either). Overally the Mechanics were great, the art style was somewhat similar to the Bordlerands games, but with a little more realistic look I suppose.Gameplay - 8/10 Good action funStory - 8/10 Compelling though shortBugs or issies -  WILL NOT RUN ON MAC must use Windows.All in all I recommend this game for story lovers who want some graphic human dismemberment without the mindlessness of some other games with gore to this degree.

												A solid though short FPS. There is alot to like, nice cel-shaded art style, interesting abilities, fast paced shooting action. The story is also very interesting, involving the personal journey of  a man named Jackie Estacato, a young mafia heir who deals with a supernatural power living inside of him, always itching to get out. His attempts to control it ends with his love ones in the crossfire...The game is a little on the short side, with my playthrough clocking out at 9 hours,in addition to a fairly useless multiplayer component...and also Dat ending...But still, worth a look if you see it on sale.

												Pros: Quad vielding feels amazing. Voice Acting is superb! (Johhny and The Darkness esspecially!) Characters like Johnny and Vinnie are amazing.(Same for the rest of the cast!) The executions are rewarding and just feel great! The hospital parts where insanely interesting. Good story. The comic book style was quite pleasant to my eyes. There's an short recap at the start of the game so you don't have to play the first game. The relics are really interesting and you really want to collect them all.Cons: The game is short.Main campain is 6-7 hours long.Plus there's Vendetta mode which adds around 4 hours to the game. A small glitch when doing executiouns during vendetta mode. Not much variety in weapons.The story is great and the character development of Jackie and his mob is simply great!The soundtrack was pleasant,and the voice acting was AMAZING.No problems with bugs or glitches except when I played the Vendettas mode and during an execution the enemy would float in the air but that only happened once.Overall the game is an AMAZING experience and the games great story is enhanced with enjoyable and satisfying gameplay.And the game is simply FUN!I got the game from my cousin as a gift when it was 1$ at humblebundle.com and the game is worth way more.

However that being said, the fighting mechanics are EXTREMELY satisifying, easily one of the more fluid and responsive games I've played in the genre. For added playtime there's also a nifty little multiplayer thrown in, with four other playable characters to chose from.			"

The Darkess 2 is a fine game, if you play the first game, you will find that this one is an improvement. The shooting is great, and the powers that you unlock are great tools. I recomend to play at the hardest setting. Once you star you new + game you'll notice that you are way to powerful.

												The Darkness 2 is a really fun FPS where you have supernatural powers and can throw buzzsaws at people and impale people with poles and other wonderful things. The story (while short) is an absolute blast to play through and I absolutely enjoyed the world that Digital Extremes ended up creating here. The characters are all interesting and entertaining in their own ways with all of their own quirks and colorful personalities. The game runs very smoothly and the cell shaded look really adds to the atmosphere of the game. My only gripes are that Vendettas mode is absolutely boring and a pain to play through without friends and even then it is really forgettable when compared to the main game, and that I ran into a couple of bugs in which I became stuck somewhere in the enviornment while moving through an airduct or some small crawl space and couldn't proceed until I just kinda jumped around a bit. But these 2 things didn't ruin my experience with the game whatsoever and I will definitely be going back through this game on New Game Plus mode to unlock all of the darkness abilities and just have a fun♥♥♥♥♥time playing this amazing game. I seriously highly recommend buying it if you love good and fun FPS games with good stories.			"

It's radically different from the original Darkness game, but it still holds up.  I will say that I enjoyed the original game much more than this one...The Darkness powers are pretty cool and the game is UNGODLY VIOLENT.  You will be dismembering people all over the place with your demon tenticles, cutting people in half with car doors, pinning people to walls with poles, cutting peoples heads off with fan blades, sending swarms of flies at people, etc...A good game that makes me hopeful for a 3rd game...

That's true, and I think The Darkness II could have done well by paying a little more respect to its predecessor, but holy crap the combat is fantastic. Once you really get the feel of controlling four arms at once, you can pull off some really crazy stuff, and you feel like an absurd unstoppable powerhouse. Seriously, this is the most fun I've had with a combat system in any game, it's that excellent. Even if the first game was stronger in many ways, this one is worth playing solely for its awesome FPS combat.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2013/04/the-darkness-ii.html "

												Bought this game on humble bundle. Beat it in 4 hours which is not bad for $1 but for the time, this game must have been baaaad. The story is really short and the multiplier is lackluster. Ai is challenging mainly because they like to spam flashbangs which shakes the screen, makes everything black and white, and blinds you and deafens you and makes you not use your darkness powers. Story is meh, i just kept skipping just so I could get back to the combat, which is the main reason to play this game (it's possible to take out 3 enemies at the same time if you shoot at one, grab one with one tentacle, and slash the other with the other tentacle which is awesome)			"

												Great storyline and good gameplay makes this game so dark.When you played this game you feel a lot of emotion for example when you saw jenny you felt lovely and you want to take the revange from darkness so everytime you saw jenny you killed the enemies with revange emotion so this is great for absorbing.I highly recommend this game for people who likes good storyline games and look for some different experience.

												The Darkeness II is not perfect. But I think its flaws dont outweigh what I like, so here we are. I would reccomend the game on sale, as it is wont to go because the combat is fast paced and fun. Sometimes theres a little too little ammo, and especially when enemies can disable your darkness powers this makes some areas a bit too hard, but the combat is fun, fast and brutal. The guns are tight, the darkness controls well, and the cell-shaded look is pretty good looking, especially considering this is based off of a comic book, as well as allowing some odd character desgin, like victor. The villians are vile, and normally I would say this is an attempt to make jackie seem like the better guy-and to a large degree thats true, but the game also never really pretends jackies perfect, so its not as obnoxious as it normally is. The story is ok, not great but not awful, and after reading some of the comic book plot summary, the veering away seems like a good choice. Everything is pretty solid, though I think they could have expanded the story and world a bit more and it would've fleshed it out a bit more.  Perhaps they couldve, but this games biggest problem probably had something to do with that-length. The game is just too damn short, and considering I enjoyed that it makes me sad that this was the case. The length is not ok, the FOV needs to be adjustable-this game is best on PC for the number of buttons that you use in combat, and not having a more adjustable FOV is unnacceptable. Also on PC, there are still bugs that don't let you get through certain areas unless you turn on Vsync, which makes the game look blurry if you leave it on by accident. Thats not ok, escpecially in this day and age of patching. The co-op is enjoyable, though the characters are all flat stereotypes, and  I can understand accusations of racism, though  I chalk it up to laziness more than anything. Still its a fun game, and I would highly reccomend it, though it may make you sad when you beat it to realize they may not make another one, considering the silence around it. Fingers crossed they do.			"

												I beat the game on normal difficulty in 6.5 hours. It's a solid FPS in the same league as Bulletstorm, Shadow Warrior, Call of Juarez: Gunslinger, and the like.Aiming is precise, enemies don't take entire clips to kill (as long as you have good aim), you're rewarded for more challenging kills with more ugprade points, and it's overall a story that makes you want to keep playing to see what happens.There's still a few things that might've been better about this game. Towards the end, as you start fighting stronger enemies, they start to feel like bullet sponges unless you are pretty much only shooting for their heads (a practice I highly recommend). Also, I felt like the special powers didn't really work well with the gunplay. For most fights, I just found some cover at a choke point and shot enemies in the head one by one - no need for special powers. If the upgrades integrated more with the shooting and were less strictly melee, I might've enjoyed that aspect of the game more and found it to be less repetitive. They also could've encouraged people to adopt a more run-and-gun style of play by including enemies or mechanics that make it difficult to just camp in one spot for the entire game and providing you with more mobility options. I felt that running around and trying to melee enemies wasn't a very viable tactic compared to camping and shooting because enemies could get so many shots on you before you close the gap.Other than that, the length is great. I don't feel like sections get too repetitive or feel like they're going on too long.If you like FPS games, you'll almost certainly like this. I would say it's not quite as good as Bullet Storm, Shadow Warrior, or call of Juarez: Gunslinger, but I definitely liked it more than Wolfenstein: New Order.			"

												A good FPS. It's got some good new ideas that I haven't really seen before. You can use dark essence that you pick up to upgrade the skills of your character which is nice. I think the addition of the asylum adds a lot to the story. The campaign's fairly short in comparison to games such as Half-Life 2 but the addition of the Vendetta mission definately gets a thumbs up from me. Each character in the Vendetta missions has a fun new unique weapon and ability and the Vendetta campaign as a whole is pretty challenging and interesting. I recognized plenty of voice talent from Mafia 2 in this game, actors from that game playing similar characters in this one. Overall, it's a solid title worth playing.			"

												Just beat the game. Contains spoilers for Darkness 1 and 2.The first one I liked alot, although I had a hard time getting around the city with the train station being the main safe zone before heading out on a mission. I eventually figured it all out so I felt accomplished when I did and got far into the game. Now that it's gone, in the Darkness II, I felt a bit cheated out of my previous experience. The main redeeming factor about DII is the STORY. So, I don't mind the ""go in a straight line to complete the game"" just as long as the story kept it's charm. What's with the fact that I can't just pull out the Darkness whenever I feel like it anymore? The reason it's gone is because Jackie is always in situations where he definitely needs it, or definitely does not need it, all due to that linear gameplay. I miss changing on command, not to mention multiple minions. Although the one is this game is funny so it's kind of sad when he dies. (I see what you did there. Good job. All the feels.)The whole time, I felt the whole ""you're in a hospital"" thing has been done before but I would have prefered more of the mindgames that happened in Darkness 1, where you actually go back in time and feel less like you're on earth and more like you might actually be in Hell. My favorite part in the first one was where you actually have to fight the darkness, or rather that you do not. (Took me a very long time to realize that, that scene was trippy. Took me 30 minutes to realize that Jenny literally gives you the answer over the Darkness laughing at you while you're shooting bullets. ""Fighting him makes him stronger, stop fighting him!"") Well in this game you actually go to Hell.... and it's not as impressive as I thought it might be. ""Hey Jackie, look you're in Hell, where do you possibly go? Oh nevermind. Just follow the relatively straight line.""Eh...Darkness III or whatever the next title may be, should there be another, should give the freedom back to the player to tackle problems at his own leisure. I'd appreciate more threatening places to go when you're not walking around the city.  The first one put you in the middle of a war with no explanation. The first one put you in a fight against the darkness. This one..... you get a schitzo-hospital and a ""you're having a delusion"" storyline.... eh.... been done before. I just saw that done on one of my Charmed DVD'SThe art style is good, although reminds me a bit too much of Borderlands. I haven't played Borderlands, but Darkness II looks ALMOST too cell shaded. Not sure what they were going for there... but... it looks alright running on my slightly above low budget gaming pc. The opening scene ""previously on the Darkness"" confused me because I wouldn't figure out if I had incorrect settings because the way the characters face was lit was just.... ugly. Tried to fix it, later realized that it's just the art style. Oh boy.Story though. That story, that voice acting. I forgive the game for everything for just having a DAMN good story and DAMN good voice acting. I don't even care. I still Love it. Just do better next time! I feel this one tried to improve where it didn't need improvements. but I think it went the right route with upgrading your abilities rather than your minions.			"

												I never played the first Darkness game, released in 2007, as it was a PS3/Xbox 360 exclusive and I have owned neither console at the time of writing. Despite my lack of familiarity with the franchise, it appeared recently during a Steam sale as if by fate, and my eye was instantly captured by the dark and gritty art style. And it stayed there until I emerged victorious at the other end of the story, having followed the continuing exploits of mafia hitman Jackie Estacado as he seeks to prevent his consumption by the ruinous power known solely as The Darkness.So let’s begin as always with the graphical style. Playing through The Darkness 2 is like traversing the pages of a comic book, hardly surprising given the series is based on the comic of the same name. Colours pop from the screen, with particularly vivid blues, reds and purples to contrast with the very dark setting. Everything looks heavily saturated in the almost cel-shaded art style, which combines with some truly excellent dynamic lighting effects, ensuring that your experience will be superbly visceral and gritty.My ears were treated remarkably well by the soundtrack, a very noir-style orchestral affair. Each element of sound balances properly against all others, a common issue that I notice during many games. This is extremely noticeable here, with background music swelling and retreating depending on how much damage Jackie is taking in a given moment, giving way to a thudding heartbeat which serves as a warning of your untimely demise. I must also commend the voice acting in general, typical movie mobster tough-guys played convincingly but not over-the-top enough to sour the experience. Special mention goes out to the portrayal of your quintessentially British darkling companion - his cockney twang and incredibly colourful vocabulary is perfectly executed, providing some fantastic comic relief during your adventure.And what an adventure! The Darkness manifests as two enormous tentacles protruding from Jackie’s back which can be used for all sorts of nasty things, such as throwing objects with lethal force, smashing through obstacles, or even simply just rending your enemies in twane with reckless abandon. Whatever floats your evil boat. Of course as a hitman you can wield a variety of weapons in addition to your shadowy appendages, making you a pretty lethal killing machine. Want to casually rip away your enemies’ shields and spray them with two machine guns at once? No problem. I did find managing all my combat options a little confusing during hectic gunfights, and you do get used to it a little as the game progressed, but even by the end I was still making mistakes so prepare to practice a bit.In addition to the aforementioned bringers of destruction, The Darkness also generously provides you with supernatural abilities that can be exchanged for essence, obtained for defeating enemies, and be creative in your killing! You’ll get more essence for rapid or spectacular death-dealing, which in turn unlocks more fantastical slaughter options. Make sure to avoid the light though, as your tendrils will retreat when exposed to it and you’ll be relying solely on conventional weaponry until you do something to remedy the situation or can retreat back into the cover of the shadows and resume your rampage of gory destruction once more.The game isn’t terribly long, and I beat the main story on normal difficulty in around five hours, but there is a little more to be had, including a New Game+ mode wherein you retain any unlocked abilities from your first run and the Vendettas storyline, a co-op multiplayer mode featuring multiple Darkness-infused assassins each wielding their own unique weapon.If you’re a fan of fast-paced dark action titles, definitely don’t pass this up. If you can, I would recommend playing the first title beforehand as there were a couple of backstory elements alluded to during the game, but don’t let it put you off if you can’t - I thoroughly enjoyed myself regardless, gleefully leaving a trail of cruor and carnage in my wake.

												Now I know it says I haven't played much in terms of hours played but I have beaten it on console...and let me tell you it is far better on PC with the mouse and keyboard.  This game's combat is fun and it really hasn't been done before...the 4 arm weilding is fantastic...and seamless.  You can go up to a car and use your demon arm to rip it off and use it as mobile cover while you dual weild .45 pistols!  It's awesome!  There are tons of abilities to unlock to make you even more powerful and tons of weapons to boot.  The only downside to this game is that it's short...and it's multiplayer is nothing really.  The draw of this game is it's story and gameplay...which you will adore especially if you have played The Darkness 1 before this.  It's just fantastic...one of the BEST stories in a FPS I have ever experienced...I would totally recommend this and you should definitely pick it up...Highly entertaining.			"

I loved everything about The Darkness, aside from getting lost on the way to Jenny's, but it was an interesting and somber tale with a really REALLY ♥♥♥♥in cool concept and well done mob tale. A classic in my book. Then The Darkness 2 was announced and revealed. I was somewhat worried about the new Cell Shaded style but it turned out to be one of the best things for the series; especially considering it's comicbook roots. Not only was the aesthetic drastically improved, but the arcade style shooter alterations, quad-wielding mechanic, new voice actors (with impeccable delivery), and INCREDIBLY paced and executed story all came together to create a real gem. Highly overlooked and underrated, The Darkness series continues to impress and I anxiously await for some form of next installment... Please? Please can haz Darkness 3?... Or DLC whcih extends past the reveal after the *true* ending?... pl0x?			"

It only took 5 hours to play through story and thats with seeing all the cut scenes and not skipping any conversations. That would be my only negitive comment really. Strong story line, strong characters, pretty good graphics and the little minion who helps you, is accually helpful. Hard to find a game that has one of those sometimes.

												Pros: Quad vielding feels amazing. Voice Acting is superb! (Johhny and The Darkness esspecially!) Characters like Johnny and Vinnie are amazing.(Same for the rest of the cast!) The executions are rewarding and just feel great! The hospital parts where insanely interesting. Good story. The comic book style was quite pleasant to my eyes. There's an short recap at the start of the game so you don't have to play the first game. The relics are really interesting and you really want to collect them all.Cons: The game is short.Main campain is 6-7 hours long.Plus there's Vendetta mode which adds around 4 hours to the game. A small glitch when doing executiouns during vendetta mode. Not much variety in weapons.The story is great and the character development of Jackie and his mob is simply great!The soundtrack was pleasant,and the voice acting was AMAZING.No problems with bugs or glitches except when I played the Vendettas mode and during an execution the enemy would float in the air but that only happened once.Overall the game is an AMAZING experience and the games great story is enhanced with enjoyable and satisfying gameplay.And the game is simply FUN!I got the game from my cousin as a gift when it was 1$ at humblebundle.com and the game is worth way more.

												This game is really a beast. The singleplayer is not that long (about 6 hours) but it's really good. Just a decent story but with a lot of brutal killing. You can use a lot of guns if you want to but playing with ''The Darkness'' is a lot more fun. It also has some other objective gamemodes where you have to kill a specific person or similar. Not really a big game but worth it. Totally recommended.			"

												I was skeptical of this game upon hearing of cel-shading & the change in dev teams, but gosh gee, if it were only longer I'd put it on par with the cult classic first title. The story pulls you in just the same with its subtle lore hidden thruout, but I would say the pacing is really skittish in the first half of the game. The Darkness' powers are as fun as ever to use for tearing apart dumb New York mobsters & cultists, & the voice-acting, especially from Johnny & Jackie, is top-notch work--coupled with the detailed characterization made possible w/ the comic-book graphics that give so much life to the cast.The game takes 'bout 7 hours to complete on SP if you take your time, & the MP campaign brings an additional 2 hours minimum (it has some replayability--but it def lacks the polish and attention-to-detail of the SP half, just being a series of strewn-together 4-player shootfests with a touch of the Darkness' power).Here's hoping we'll see more of the Darkness.

												Pros:-Nice soundtrack-Cool gameplay-Coop campaign-Mike PattonCons:-Short durationThis game was way better than expected. I thought it'd be bad but it ended up being an amazing game. Though there are some features from the first game that don't appear in this one, there are new features which make up for that.The only negative aspect about this game is its duration, it took me about 17 hours to finish it twice (The first time in normal difficulty and the second one on the hardest one) and also finish the Vendetta campaign, and the hardest difficulty isn't that difficult.So... as I said before, this is a great game and even though it can be pretty short if you're fast and don't die much, it's definitely worth paying.

												Absolutely loved this game, the greatly story driven FPS with a search to find your beloved girlfriend was a great thrill to play through. I couldn't find myself to stop playing. As you go on through the game you find your ""Darkness"" to have a great impact on the story and changing the setting in great fashion, along side the monologue from Jackie Estacado after everything happens. The combat is also never a boring task as the game gives you multiple ways to either execute, mutilate or just shoot up your enemies. Anyways this game is fantastic and I can't believe it took me this long to play it.			"

												I have not played any of the multiplayer, so this review shall be focussed on the campaign aspect of the game.The darkness two is a gritty first person shooter. The unique selling point is that, in addition to being, in its own right, a relatively solid shooter, there is a supernatural twist. The darkness. The darkness is characterised well as a sort of demonic entity, though it takes a little time to get used to its over the top voice, which can be a little cheesy at times. In combat, the darkness powers are balanced well with the gunplay, you shouldn't find yourself being forced into a playstyle. However, particular strategies must be used for certain enemies. This can swing between being an enjoyable challenge to blisteringly frustrating. The skill tree in the game is relatively natural, and at no point during a first playthrough of a campaign should you find yourself overmighty, or conversely, ill-equipped to face the challenges of the game. One play-though didn't complete my skill wheel, so there is replay value if you feel like returning to collect all of Jackie's skills. The story is appropriately cartoonish and absurd, though this doesn't stop it from remaining dark and looming in tone. It is possibly more unsettling precisely due to it being surreal. The morbid atmosphere is reflected well in the gameplay, which incorporates sadistic (and satisfying) feats of violence wherever possible. One such mechanic that was absent from the first game is that of “executions”. These finishing moves allow Jackie to tear enemies apart in monstrously visceral ways. It is wonderful to give that guy that's been annoyingly shooting you across the map, while you've been killing mooks, exactly what is coming to him. The support characters are not bad, and aren't difficult to appreciate. That being said, there were very little surprises in the story, and this feels like a game that could have done with a really good twist.It's good fun, but it won't blow you away: 6/10			"

												I beat the game on normal difficulty in 6.5 hours. It's a solid FPS in the same league as Bulletstorm, Shadow Warrior, Call of Juarez: Gunslinger, and the like.Aiming is precise, enemies don't take entire clips to kill (as long as you have good aim), you're rewarded for more challenging kills with more ugprade points, and it's overall a story that makes you want to keep playing to see what happens.There's still a few things that might've been better about this game. Towards the end, as you start fighting stronger enemies, they start to feel like bullet sponges unless you are pretty much only shooting for their heads (a practice I highly recommend). Also, I felt like the special powers didn't really work well with the gunplay. For most fights, I just found some cover at a choke point and shot enemies in the head one by one - no need for special powers. If the upgrades integrated more with the shooting and were less strictly melee, I might've enjoyed that aspect of the game more and found it to be less repetitive. They also could've encouraged people to adopt a more run-and-gun style of play by including enemies or mechanics that make it difficult to just camp in one spot for the entire game and providing you with more mobility options. I felt that running around and trying to melee enemies wasn't a very viable tactic compared to camping and shooting because enemies could get so many shots on you before you close the gap.Other than that, the length is great. I don't feel like sections get too repetitive or feel like they're going on too long.If you like FPS games, you'll almost certainly like this. I would say it's not quite as good as Bullet Storm, Shadow Warrior, or call of Juarez: Gunslinger, but I definitely liked it more than Wolfenstein: New Order.			"

Now there are people who dont want you to posses the darkness. In my persional opinion - ♥♥♥♥ EM!Anyway. this game is really ♥♥♥♥ing brutal. If you like ponies and don't wanna see people get ripped apart - this isn't the game for you - it's bsiclly all you do - through out the entire game. Even tho this might sound kinda ""one-sided"" - it's really not. You find new ways to tear your enemies appart - literally.Storywise this game is rather weak in my opinion. It's real easy to understand the story, but its not really ""that deep"". But then again - you can tear people apart so what does this mather?Its also quite short (singleplayer: about 6 hours)Anyhow: i'd give this game a 9/10			"

												The Darkness II is without a doubt a gem in the game history.In my opinon this game has two quite different sides, the one being the quite graphic mutilation drawn upon human/hellish beings with your powers, the other is the romantic part where you try to retrieve your love back in your arms once again.The graphics are quite impressive, and the whole texture has it's own touch from the great artists who worked on this game, you will notice a few lines on a otherwise blank surface, and as they've done that with almost each possible template it gives this certain dark, somewhat grim look.The music and atmosphere is definitely well suited for the certain areas, the fighting music really pumps up your will to just push forward and slice and dice your way through with nothing but your Dark unholy powers!I don't know why, but they decided to put in some comic relief with your AI-controlled sidekick The Darkling, he makes a fistful of jokes and laughs every now and then, so it's not all that dark~ I do however think that if the game went fully dark with no jokes squeezed in what so ever it would have been quite good as well.The deep and intense storyline builds up and is actually something understandable for once (played alot of games with rushed dialouges and story so I ended up understanding nothing) I won't tell much about it because it's a true experience to discover what's going on!This game deserves a steady 10/10 from my side. I wish I could go into more detail but that would truly ruin the fun and excitement for exploring :)~Lyh flare[DO NOT HOVER YOUR MOUSE OVER THE TEXT IF YOU DON'T WANT A SPOILER!] I am a bit slow at these games because I enjoy the scenery need every dialouge and cutscene fully so after roughly about 1½ hour with nothing but fun and mutilating you wake up at the asylum hospital... That truly blew my mind.  "

												This is an amazing game. So much so that I made it my player photo. While the campaign is a little short, it is a really great story, and one that almost made me cry near the end at a certain character's death. The gameplay is also amazing, it is so much fun to slice'n'dice hordes of enemies to pieces, and those executions, while brutal, are great. You can pick up car doors and billboards as shields which can then be thrown to bisect and decapitate enemies. Iron scafolding poles, pool sticks and parking meters can be thrown to impale enemies. A favourite ability of mine is the ground slam, done by knocking an enemy up and then down again quickly with the demon arms to insta-kill and cause a shockwave that knocks nearby enemies over. I have heard reviews say that ""gore can only sustain a game for so long"" but even if the executions were all that made this game great, I have put over 50 hours into this thing and not gotten bored of trisecting enemies yet. The vendetta's mode are also good, focussing less on being an almighty shadow god, and more on teamwork, seeing as each character only has one of Jackie's abilities. The relics are  also worth having a look for, as they each have an interesting backstory, told by the anxiety ridden Johny Powell. All in all this game is great, with only its relative shortness (and some unskippable cutscenes) holding it back from being amazing. 9/10			"

 Pros -Awesome main story that will keep you playing for a good while.-Cartoon-ish visuals that give this graphic-novel kind of vibe to this game.-Really gory and gruesome for all of you blood-lusting sick ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.-Plenty of choise for your approach, invest points in new skills and use them as you go throught the main story or just gun everyone down like in regular shooter (Headshots are pretty OP, as they should be).-Replayability for the main story and a different mini-stories that you can play with your friends in coop.-Didn't seen any bugs at all, everything runs smootly and the game itself is pretty fast-paced.-Full controller support. Cons -No coop for main story, but it kind of makes sense.-The game is pretty lineal and your choises won't change much.-Maybe it's just me, but I felt like the main story is kind of short. Or maybe I just got too sucked in it.-Once you get a grip on your abilities, it becomes too easy, even on hard difficulty.But besides that, this game is a really solid and must-have purchase and I do recommend it.8/10.

												Hi, my name is Phil. I was born and raised in Kentucky. When I was 7 years old I walked in on my mom giving a BJ to my best friend's dad, Jim Whit. My mom, Sugar (her actual name), would tell me stories of my mentally challenged father that she accidently got the little hot dog slipped from. One of those many visual stories was when he came home from a gay stripper club that he thought was his new workplace. Don't ask me how he got a job. My mom would never let me into this room upstairs, that whenever I went up to peek under the old worn door I would see these black tight leather clothes. She would bring asian, black, white, and mexican men who had a low self-esteem into the room to ""play"" with. Many times have I walked on my mom being ganged banged, taking it from all sides. I could always hear her grunting upstairs and even hear her lodging things in her♥♥♥♥♥♥ Yeah, I know, sick. I ran from my home at the age of 16 years old. I had no money and barely any clothes. At 14 years old, I took a knife and stabbed a man in the spine while he was banging her analy, paralyzing for life. He had it coming. Those no life ♥♥♥♥ faces who banged my mom didn't deserve to live. Any ways I'm 16 years old and I have ran away from home. In the impoverished part of the city was a run down apartment that I lived in till I was 18. After I had left the apartment I moved to the ghetto and joined a gang. I quickly earned 5 tears on the right eye and 1 on the left eye from when Martinez, a very close member, was brutally killed.  Now I was actual white trash.

The story is a little short, as others have said 	  but it was very well done and well paced. Personally, I ended up playing through the entire game without even realizing I had wasted more than 7 hours. The only problems I had was at times the game held your hand a little too much,  please stop reminding me to step out of the light god damnit!  or not quite enough. There were a couple times I was wandering around a solid 4 minutes before realizing I could go through a way that could have been marked better. Overall though, tons of fun and I'll probably be playing through again just because the combat is SO satisfying.			"

												The Darkness II is a pretty solid FPS. If you know anything about the first game, you know that the first one isn't on PC. Well, two years after the events of the first game, two years after Jackie Estacado takes revenge on Paulie Franchetti for killing his gf, Jenny, and attempting to assasinate him, Jackie is the mob boss of the Franchettie family. In the beginning of the game, the Darkness is dormant within Jackie, the Darkness being a supernatural extension that has transferred itself on the Estacado family line. The story of The Darkness II follows Jackie surviving an assassination attempt in which he awakens the Darkness and hunts down those who attacked him. Unbeknownst to him, someone had set out to kill him or take him alive in order to obtain thd Darkness for themselves. Basically, Jackie uses his resources and his mafia friends to hunt down this group of people, not going to go into to much detail, crazy spoilers on that.The plot was pretty good, but a bit repetitive. There wasn't too much of a story arc, as it really is rather straightforward; that is until you start to hallucinate yourself in an asylum and much later in the game, hell. Stuff does get bizarre, such as Jackie hallucinating Jenny while in the middle of missions. Even though the Darkness is making him go mad and wants to believe she's real, he understands that he's not exactly in control of his powers.Well, anyway, the story was good, but it had it's flaws. Onto the technical side of things, like gameplay. Rather simple as far as shooting goes, you've all probably played FPS games so I'm not gonna bother getting into detail. I do want to talk about the tentacles that extend from Jackie's body. They're awesome. I mean, they're evil, but they're great as weapons. You can slice people apart, hold them in the air and flay them, eat their hearts for health (which by the way does mean there's a health bar), you can also control how you slice based on what direction you swing the right stick in, or if you're using a kb/m, it would be the mouse. Graphics were interesting, they using cel shaders for this one to get that comic book style as the game is based on a series of comics, while the first game went for a more realistic look. There are, at points, where the stuttering was bad, mainly in Jackie's penthouse. Otherwise, the framerates were good. A few other bugs here and there, but not enough to say the game is buggy.Anyway.8.3/10Oh, and stay for the post credits scene.			"

												I never finished the first Darkness because it wasn't on PC and I suck at shooters on my PS3. So fortunately there was a previously on Darkness at the start of this game, but to be honest it wasn't very detailed so I had to go to wikipedia to find out what happened in the first Darkness.Regardless of that, it doesn't take you long to be pulled into the story. The Darkness 2 does a great job of immersing you into the feelings and thoughts of the main character, which is a rarity in modern day gaming. Often you are very disconected from the story and the emotions of the characters. Lately, the only other game I have played that did such a great job of pulling you in, emotionally, was BioShock Infinite.Beyond the story, which while nothing especially impressive (mostly due to the fact the game is only 6 hours long), what is there is enough and is well orcestrated. The most impressive feat is the game's ability to put you in the shoes of the main character and really doubt what is real and what is not real (in the game).The gameplay is top notch though and if you enjoy shooters where you run from one area to the next and have to clear all the waves of enemies, then this is a game for you. The gunplay is fun and has impact and the tentacles are well implemented so that they are not overpowered and yet are still very fun and exciting to use. I found myself using primarily guns but definitely had to use my powers frequently to stay in the fight. I was glad though that the powers did not dominate the gameplay so that you simply use the powers when you feel the need and are not forced to constantly use the powers. In some games where you have powers they dominate the other gameplay mechanics to the point that you find yourself only using the powers and nothing else. Fortunately, this is not the case in the Darkness 2.The graphics are not impressive or special, but they make up for what they lack in the style, which once you've played the game to completion the style will make sense. A lot of people were surprised when they first revealed the first gameplay video of The Darkness 2 because of the art style they had used. But there is a definite reason for it and it only further helps immerse you into the world of confusion that the main character is living in.The soundtrack is great and the voice work is top quality. All in all, it is a very fun game with a decent story that manages to pull you in and leaves you desiring more.Would definitely recommend giving this game a spin! It is a great purchase and a great experience to play through once or even twice! In addition there are even some co-op missions to further the experience, so if you have a friend to play it with it will add a few more hours of quality gameplay.			"

												Ever wanted to shoot a guy, rip his head off and then eat his heart, all in an arcady setting? Well then darkness two is the game for you!You play as jackie, a victem to the darkness who, untill now has always kept it hidden. Well now its loose and youve gone ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! The guns in darkness to feel great, and while rather the selection of guns is rather limited, the ability to duel wield and use mini dragons makes up for that. The story, while it can feel tacked on at times, is deffenetly not second rate. They do a good job of portraing jackies emotionsal struggle after loosing jenny in the previous game. And the voice acting, oh god its wonderful, and very well written. The game also has a coop vendetta mode, which I regret to say deffenetly feels like an after thought. The missions and just ""Do♥♥♥♥♥♥jackie cant be bothered with."" But for a few hours of fun with friends its not bad.So there you have it folks! Great game, great story, great guns. It is however a bit on the pricy side, so peronally I would wait for a sale to come around to buy this one. Solid 7/10			"

												Hi, my name is Phil. I was born and raised in Kentucky. When I was 7 years old I walked in on my mom giving a BJ to my best friend's dad, Jim Whit. My mom, Sugar (her actual name), would tell me stories of my mentally challenged father that she accidently got the little hot dog slipped from. One of those many visual stories was when he came home from a gay stripper club that he thought was his new workplace. Don't ask me how he got a job. My mom would never let me into this room upstairs, that whenever I went up to peek under the old worn door I would see these black tight leather clothes. She would bring asian, black, white, and mexican men who had a low self-esteem into the room to ""play"" with. Many times have I walked on my mom being ganged banged, taking it from all sides. I could always hear her grunting upstairs and even hear her lodging things in her♥♥♥♥♥♥ Yeah, I know, sick. I ran from my home at the age of 16 years old. I had no money and barely any clothes. At 14 years old, I took a knife and stabbed a man in the spine while he was banging her analy, paralyzing for life. He had it coming. Those no life ♥♥♥♥ faces who banged my mom didn't deserve to live. Any ways I'm 16 years old and I have ran away from home. In the impoverished part of the city was a run down apartment that I lived in till I was 18. After I had left the apartment I moved to the ghetto and joined a gang. I quickly earned 5 tears on the right eye and 1 on the left eye from when Martinez, a very close member, was brutally killed.  Now I was actual white trash. Thank you for reading my Darkness II review.			"

												I bought this game when it was only $3 and I have to say it wasn't a disappointment.  All in all a fun little romp, well worth the money I spent on it.Pros:Nice graphics, uses cel shading, a bit dated but still looked really nice.Nice atmosphere and music.Storyline was decent, not top shelf but not bad either.Humor, added a bit to the dialogue.Cons:Combat with the darkness snakes was a bit wonky.Weapon diversity was kind of bleh, no reason to change out weapons really and all of them felt the same. Very linear.Neither pro nor con, mostly opinion.A little on the short side, could be a pro or con depending on how you look at it.Gore was over the top in some instances, but some people like that.The coop was kind of boring, offered some more humor and what not but just seemed more of the same and didn’t add a helluva lot to the overall game.Overall I would recommend this game if you can pick it up under 5 bucks, worth a quick playthrough.

												It has got a great story with some twists and turns and keeps the player engaged to the game. Then the gameplay... what's not to love? Great guns and the two extra ""demon arms"" which are used to slice the foes apart and to throw things at them as well.In addition to the single player part, it also has got a ""multiplayer"" part called ""Vendettas"". It's merely one campaign consisting of five or six missions which can be played either solo or with up to three other players. Outside of that it also has got some ""Hit List"" missions which can be played solo or with others as well.By completing the main portion of the game, you unlock ""New Game+"" which allows the player keeping all powers from previous playthrough and to choose which chapter to begin from (only want to play the end boss battle? Sure thing). I think that's pretty nice.All in all, I really liked ""The Darkness 2"" and I'm hoping for a third installment in this series. If you like FPS games with a twist, then buy it whenever you have a chance of doing so.			"

												I loved the game! Really awesome! Only problems are a few glitches but other than that this game is really good. Glitches are sometimes when you talk to someone, their head spazzes out a bit. Also on some of the quests I don't think I followed them as intended (e.g. at one point I was able to kill some guys through a window on the roof before jumping down and reaching the quest marker, glitching out the game so I couldn't press the button to open the gate and let the darkling drive that truck through the clown door.)The game had good character development, the storyline was good, although at points a little predictable, and the controls were easy to learn and use.

												Download size: Less than 10 gbPlay time: About 6 hours for campaignThe Darkness 2 is based on a popular comic book that I haven’t read, and the first Darkness game never made it to Steam/PC. Fortunately, I found the story strong enough to stand alone so I didn’t feel like I was missing any important backstory. There’s a “previously on the Darkness” cutscene that you can watch upon starting a new game, and there’s actually some “talking head” scenes between game chapters where the protagonist Jackie talks to the player as if he’s narrating his autobiography, so you should be caught up pretty quick.You play Jackie Estacado, a kind of Mafia boss who has sworn off using the Darkness, a demonic entity that inhabits his body and gives him superhuman powers at the cost of his soul. Too bad for Jackie, a powerful mysterious group comes to town determined to reclaim the Darkness, which they used to be caretakers for. Since the Darkness can only be given up willingly, the only way for them to get it back is by turning Jackie’s life upside down and torturing him into giving it up. This means war.The Darkness 2 is a first person shooter with the gimmick of having 2 Darkness tentacles that you can use to grab objects or slash at enemies with. You can also dual wield many one handed guns, so essentially you have 4 limbs to kill people with (2 guns + 2 tentacles). The Darkness also gives you a few powers that you unlock through purchasing in darkness “shrines” found throughout the world. You get dark essence by killing enemies and finding special artifacts, then spend the essence at the shrines on skills and upgrades. It’s not an open world game, you just find the shrines all over the place along the way. There are 4 skill trees to spend your essence in, but you won’t find enough essence in one playthrough to purchase everything. You’ll need to use the New Game + option and grind for more essence. One of the key game elements is the need to destroy light sources (lamps, street lights, etc.) since bright lights will inhibit the Darkness, causing your screen to lens flare out and go black and white. Your powers and Darkness tentacles are also disabled when this happens so if you’re playing one of the higher difficulty levels you need to snipe out lights before you get too close. The Darkness 2 uses a regenerating health system like Gears of War or any of the Modern Warfare games so if you’re taking too much damage, get behind something for a few seconds to recover.Pros:+Excellent story with some twisted enemy bosses. The boss battles aren’t spectacular, but you’ll probably really hate those dudes by the time you get to fight them.+Pretty good graphics, which kind of remind me of the Borderlands games but with more detail. There are a number of death animations for various ways that you can use the Darkness to execute weakened enemies. The tentacle arm executions can be gruesome. +The game has a long co-op campaign called Vendettas, though I have only tried a few of the missions (they run parallel to the single player campaign with 4 new characters). The Vendetta missions have their own bosses and you can build up character specific skill trees with dark essence gathered in multiplayer games.Cons:-There are a ton of characters and even though I’ve played through the game twice, I only know the names of 3-4 of them. I’m sure most of them were in the first game so they’re just making appearances in part 2. They aren’t all that important though, so no sweat.-The game is very short at under 6 hours for your first playthrough, but this doesn’t include the Vendetta campaign. It means you probably need a co-op partner to get the full experience. For your second/third playthrough (with all your maxed out powers) if you skip the cutscenes you can probably finish the single player campaign in less than 5 hours.All in all, the Darkness 2 is a great game and well worth the low price you can find it at. It was even in the $1 tier of a Humble Bundle a few months back so you can probably get it cheap. The game’s highlight is the single player story, and you probably won’t find many people playing multiplayer nowadays.  "

												The Darkness 2 is what I like to classify as a power-fantasy game. You will often find yourself wading into enemies, shooting and tearing your enemies to pieces all around you. Health and cover are not a huge issue as you can tear the hearts out of fallen/staggered foes for a health boost on the fly. The game also boasts what they call ""quad-wielding""; allowing you to use your demon tendrils as an extra 2 hands. This lets you actively grab items and enemies, hold shields or use the tendrils as a close range whip; all while keeping your actual hands free to fire your guns. The combat is fast and furious and feels very satisfying. An interesting mechanic is the fact that your Darkness powers don't work in the light, and your enemies in the mid-late parts of the game know this. Enemies will come at you with shoulder mounted spotlights and employ flashbangs to try and slow you down. It keeps it interesting as the enemy with the light instantly becomes your priority regardless of the armored shotgunners 10 feet away from you. The story is engaging and fun, but is not too long. You play the head of a mafia family with powers known as ""The Darkness"" as your organization engages in all out war with an ancient dark cult intent on stealing your powers and killing anyone in their way. Definitely not a plot you come across often! Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who thinks this sounds interesting as I had lots of fun with it!			"

												Game is so-so.The art is pretty cool, it looks a bit cartoonish but not too much. The colors and so on make the game really appealing to the eyes and some environment are pretty brilliant (the Resort park for example).In term of gameplay, well that is brilliant for the first 2 hours : being able to throw things at your ennemies or cut them in half is great but after a while it become really redundant as basically no new moves can be unlocked. The gunfight are pretty boring : your ennemies are basically sponge that will absorb 10-15 bullets before dying. I especiialy felt it really difficult to have headshot detected by the game. Moreove, most of the time, the game just throws waves of ennemy.The game is also really short - 5 hours without running. Considering the fact that i got the game on HB it is not a big problem (actually, if the game were longer, i do not think i would have even tried to finish it since it is so redundant) but when i look at its price tag of Steam...errrr. Pick it up on for less than 10€.			"

												Where to start: it wasn't what I was expecting but was surprisingly good for the wild and crazy story that it is.  Not sure how to describe it, a twisted comic book style of writing with a mobster backstory and bits of goofy humour thrown in.  Single player might be a bit short but there's coop modes and 'new game+' mode to keep you busy.  Has some very nice cell shading eye candy too.			"

 Pros -Awesome main story that will keep you playing for a good while.-Cartoon-ish visuals that give this graphic-novel kind of vibe to this game.-Really gory and gruesome for all of you blood-lusting sick ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.-Plenty of choise for your approach, invest points in new skills and use them as you go throught the main story or just gun everyone down like in regular shooter (Headshots are pretty OP, as they should be).-Replayability for the main story and a different mini-stories that you can play with your friends in coop.-Didn't seen any bugs at all, everything runs smootly and the game itself is pretty fast-paced.-Full controller support. Cons -No coop for main story, but it kind of makes sense.-The game is pretty lineal and your choises won't change much.-Maybe it's just me, but I felt like the main story is kind of short. Or maybe I just got too sucked in it.-Once you get a grip on your abilities, it becomes too easy, even on hard difficulty.But besides that, this game is a really solid and must-have purchase and I do recommend it.8/10.

												Words cannot even DESCRIBE how much fun this game is. I consider the storyline immersive and up near bioshock infinite / The Last Of us. It confuses your brain, it gets you thinking, and wanting to play more. One demon arm slash at a time. And with this new perspective of first person, where you literally have four weapons at the same time at your disposal. It is extremely gorey, and a joy whenever you rip someones head off, or get a new execution. It has skill trees, so for all of you rpg lovers out there, this game is for you. you can build up your character, and make him a flesh tearing demon. You see your character evolve over time, from normal jackie estano, to something else. I rate this game 11/10. If you dont play this game, then your not a gamer. Pretty much the best game i have ever played. Amazing storyline, gameplay, graphics , visuals, aswell as voice acting. Everything is perfect about this game, and you should buy it.			"

												Hi, my name is Phil. I was born and raised in Kentucky. When I was 7 years old I walked in on my mom giving a BJ to my best friend's dad, Jim Whit. My mom, Sugar (her actual name), would tell me stories of my mentally challenged father that she accidently got the little hot dog slipped from. One of those many visual stories was when he came home from a gay stripper club that he thought was his new workplace. Don't ask me how he got a job. My mom would never let me into this room upstairs, that whenever I went up to peek under the old worn door I would see these black tight leather clothes. She would bring asian, black, white, and mexican men who had a low self-esteem into the room to ""play"" with. Many times have I walked on my mom being ganged banged, taking it from all sides. I could always hear her grunting upstairs and even hear her lodging things in her♥♥♥♥♥♥ Yeah, I know, sick. I ran from my home at the age of 16 years old. I had no money and barely any clothes. At 14 years old, I took a knife and stabbed a man in the spine while he was banging her analy, paralyzing for life. He had it coming. Those no life ♥♥♥♥ faces who banged my mom didn't deserve to live. Any ways I'm 16 years old and I have ran away from home. In the impoverished part of the city was a run down apartment that I lived in till I was 18. After I had left the apartment I moved to the ghetto and joined a gang. I quickly earned 5 tears on the right eye and 1 on the left eye from when Martinez, a very close member, was brutally killed.  Now I was actual white trash. Thank you for reading my Darkness II review.			"

												Alright! Here we are again, back together reliving memories of the times we were molested at summer camp. Wait. Oh, we're doing a review? Whoops.So, The Darkness II!If you played the first Darkness, you must have been left wanting more. I know I was, especially when Jenny says, ""Wake up."", then it cuts the credits. I don't think I've been that anxious since I was waiting on a pregnancy test to show results. The first game was awesome. The elements of free-roam/sandbox the developers so graciously added, the voice acting, the level design and coloring....it was all just so enveloping! I personally really like the No Mans Land levels where you were thrown into the war between the Germans and the British - that was some terrifying♥♥♥♥♥♥ All that to say, The Darkness laid excellent ground work for The Darkness 2 with the story, color schemes and voice acting. Unlike BLOPS 2, TD 2 didn't completely destroy the gameline's reputation. That is to say, unless you're one of those pretentious and picky ♥♥♥♥♥♥s who nitpicks about with the changes in graphics or things like that. The first thing I noticed that I really liked about this game is the slow intro to the main theme of the game. Obviously, it wasn't that slow, since you get ambushed during your dinner with some ladies of the night at some deago food spot within the first 10 or so minutes of the game - BUT - at least the devs eased you into it instead of the begining of TD 1 where your flying through traffic, shooting at people. The steady introduction of the darkness powers and influence was pretty neat, as well. So time moves on and I start noticing things like the full axis control of the demon arms and the RIDICULOUS executions you can do and I start to think, ""This reminds me of my last relationship"".Then I think, ""Wow, this is really well made!"" The game, albiet, was shorter than I had hoped for, but still, its the Darkness irregardless. (TBCNT)			"

Whether its witnessing evil men do things to the people that Jackie cares about or unleashing Jackie's vengance upon them, this game pushes the boundaries of gore and adult themes.  There are good amounts of re-playablity here with the ""Don"" Difficulty almost requireing some of Jackie's upgrades to be maxed out just to stay alive. There is also a enjoyable co-op experience where the player fills the roles of one of 4 colorful darkness welding evil slayers.			"

												Absolutely great game. So much fun with a deep, dark storyline. I love a good FPS that keeps up on the story part of it and this wins at that. I never played the first one and so I'm sure I'm missing out on some little tidbits here and there, but they're very few and I didn't feel like I was missing out on anything significant. The story really draws you in. Make sure you collect as many artifacts as possible and later go through and have the paranormal expert guy there tell you about them, they're gruesomely hilarous. Speaking of gruesome, the game is ultra-violent, bloody, and messy. Far more than just shooting people. Even I was all, ""Holy crap!"" in a few places, and I'm pretty jaded to such things.			"

The only gripe I have with it is that it was kind of short, I managed to beat the campaign on Hitman level difficulty in about 5 hours. There is still new game plus for those itching for more fun and vendettas mode (hoard mode) which can extend your fun. If you see it on sale, grab it!			"

												I would only recommend playing this game because it is unique. I don't remember playing an FPS like this before. I found the overall game quite boring and this could have been made much better with a much more appealing story and a much longer one. The main story campaign can be completed in under 8 hours maximum. It can get quite repetitive and the look of this game is inconsistent but still very good for it's age. It's worth playing but I doubt I would revisit this. It certainly lacks re playability. Next installment needs some changes.			"

												This game was a gem for getting it on the Steam Summer sale. However it is a very short game. I finished the story in only 6 hours. The graphics are not bad for a older game. The storyline however is pretty good. I did not experiece any bugs or crashes which was also nice for a older game on a current PC. I still find at the full price of $32.99 CDN I would have just put it on my wishlist for a cheaper price. It is not really worth $30 for only 6 hours of gameplay. If you get it on sale for $15-20 then go for it.			"

												Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be the head of a major crime syndicate whilst simultaneously being possessed by a creature of pure evil? Well then this might be the game for you.This is an awesome first person shooter. The gameplay is top-notch, responsive and heart pounding. Each of the guns that you can acquire really packs a punch and you get to see the joy on your enemies faces as you literally blow them away with furious anger and harsh language. Of course the huge arsenal is not the main attraction of this game. That comes in the form of your two tentacle friends and the terrible powers they grant you. First off the tentacles themselves really pack a punch allowing you to execute some very gruesome and disgusting executions; I think there are at least ten, all of which look really cool… If you happen to be a sadist, which we all are. Then there are the powers, eating hearts to gain health, rapid fire explosive bullets and lobbing black holes just to name a few. You will have a ton of fun tearing your way through the city.The creators were going for an art style that was reminiscent of a graphic novel and they really hit the nail on the head. The game is beautiful in its own dark way. The environments were nothing too special but each one had its own feel and lent to the overall bleak atmosphere. As for the story, it was pretty good, nothing too amazing but it allowed the player to exact bloody vengeance and tug at the heart strings as well.Besides the main single player campaign, which only lasts a few hours, there is also a second game mode that can be undertaken in single or multiplayer. In it you get to play as one of four new characters all with their own dark weapons and powers. It added a lot more longevity to the title and with the unique storyline it is well worth a play. I had a go with all the characters to see which one suited me best before blasting my way through everyone who looked at me funny.This game is awesome and frankly it is very underrated. If you pick this up you will find a very enjoyable and bombastic adventure that will have you want to play through a couple times. Even at full price it’s a good title but on sale you would be mad not to pick it up.Have fun  ^_^ "

NoteI played through The Darkness 1 a several times back in the day. It felt refreshing and surprisngly awesome, so my review is definitely biased. Also, I played this game with a gamepad. I did not feel like using KB + Mouse.What I expectedI went into this game expecting nothing special after reading some of the reviews. I mainly expected a game with okay gameplay and a forgettable story. What I gotNow I was right about the gameplay, but I soon found myself getting sucked into the story and its characters. I don't know what it was, but I really got enveloped by the game's narrative. The voice acting and writing are definitely above average in my opinion. The few twists in the game actually surprised me, and I loved coming along for the ride. Maybe it's because I played and liked the first game so much, but I found myself empathizing for Jackie. What I thinkI was thoroughly surprised and impressed by this game. It is fantastic, and I'd wholly recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy a gritty, linear action game with decent gameplay and an above-average narrative. Man, that ending.			"

												This is one of those games that should be in ""Meh"" category... It is not bad enough to be ""Not Recommended"", neither is it good enough to be in the better of the two...Keep in mind, that I did not play the first part, and just read the story on the webz... It might, or might not have influenced my opinion on the game.So, short review... This game is a classic shooter, no-brainer, in which you usually just need to run around and kill large quantities of enemies. Story is short and okayish, and the game would probably be worse if it dragged for more than those couple of hours, and for those who like it, there is New Game +... Gun play is fine, but nothing special, and it bothered me that I usually didn't know what gun I used (it was not really important), as long as I had enough ammunition for any of those...Blood and gore are all around, and if you are not okay with it, don't play this game...Experience system is somewhat important at the beginning, but later on, I just didn't know what perks to buy (they are all nothing special), so finished the game with many unspent points...Graphics is ok, but, as the name of the game suggests, too dark :)Final verdict is ""Meh""... It is ok game for a few hours of no-brainer fun, but nothing more than that... On the other hand, I don't like these kind of shooters to much, so it might be only me :)			"

												I had wanted this game for a few years but never really picked it up. When I saw it was on a discount, I immediately bought it. It did not disappoint! However, there is one very big con. It doesn't bother me as much, but I know it bothers many other people. It's VERY SHORT. Most people say it's roughly 6 to 9 hours, but I completed it in 3-4 on the Hard (not Very Hard) difficulty.Pros: -Nice graphics for it's age-Incredibly satisfying shooting/combat-Very nice and interesting story-Great music aswell as great sounds for the weapons-Plenty of weapons.-Customize your character by choosing one of the 4 talent trees (or multiple) (eventhough some are clearly stronger than others)Cons:-Very short story-Light mechanic is quite annoying from time to time (you can't do very much while in light, so you have to destroy them, eventhough some are invincible)-Very linear-Lack of approaches (yes, you can choose your weapons but there is no stealth AT ALL)CONCLUSION: In my opinion, it's not worth it's €29,99 price, but if you can pick it up at 80% off it's definitely a great experience! One of the top games I have recently played.			"

												Personal Rating: 8 of 10Awesome game! This masterpiece excels in every possible way. Apart from your convention gun blasting FPS, this game allows you to quad wield by adding 2 tendrils that you can use simultaneously with your guns. The gameplay is really refreshing and I typically liked the graphics style that uses cel-shading to give it a 2d-ish comical look.The plot is rather straight forward but the way the story is presented with the incredible in-game voiced dialogue really captivates brings out each character.The game is rather narrative where there are plenty of dialogs, but they are so well done you won't be bored. The level design are rather short although each of them stands out since they tend to have different settings. There are quite a variety of enemies to keep things interesting and I think the length of each level is just nice to keep players from getting bored.The developers also added other game modes that you can play with friends with new characters and skills. I said friends because there are no one online anymore.There are a couple of minor bugs which i encountered such as weapons dropped below ground and prevents you from picking up and the graphics jerk sometimes (during non-combat moment/close up with NPCs). The game also has almost zero replay value. This game had tonnes of potential. After each mission you head back to your mansion. And I think the game can use some upgrades apart from skills where you can manage back in the mansion.Also, I have a 360 controller plugged into my PC. The game detected the controller and every button prompt are for the controller. I cannot find where to disable this so I was having quite a hard time figuring out the keys.Many people are questioning why is there a DLC link in the library page but none was found in store. Unfortunately this game does not get the recognition it deserved. The developers really did a great job with the game but the sales did not hit their expection and further funding was pulled off including planned DLCs.I was really hoping for a sequel of a prequel remake for PC. And this time it should get its well deserved recognition.			"

												It's an arcade slaughterhouse with Mark Hamill's most crazy and psychotic agressive performance in your ears (he gives the voice to the Darkness), which manifests as two snakeline tendrils and demonic powers that rip everything apart around you in a messy, blood way. Like you have two velociraptors on your back that rival each other who gets the bigger part of the men they just pulled apart at hands and legs. Basicly, that's it. There is a vengeance mafia story in which all this plays, and randombadguy.no4578 who wants to steal your power for it's own evil world dominating plans, but let's be honest: nobody cares. The game isn't even made a way that could make you care, and for this the longer, talking story sections will give this feeling of ""skip it! skip it already! Give me back my Mark Hamill velociraptors already!"".It's really fun, runs great on basicly everything that isn't a toaster, the celshaded graphics are a take it or leave it depending on your taste, but definitly look great aside from some interiors. Doesn't last long, and honestly it's for the best, because it fires everything it has quite early, let's you enjoy everything for a bit more than enough time while it lasts, than it ends just when it would start to get boring. Don't pick it up at full price, but around 5-7 euros it's more than worth it, with all the blast, while it lasts. This is among those few weirdly perfect games what absolutely lack basicly everything other than it's main feature, but that is so awesome it can carry the entire game (such as Portal or Shadow of Mordor). The Darkness II deserves more fame because it's absolutely fantastic at what it does. Just don't have any other expections.			"

												TL;DR - Good game - not worth full price.Pros:+ Fluid gameplay/Great controls+ Immersive story with good voice acting+ Well balanced difficultyCons:+ Relatively short game+ Monologue format of story tellingI received this game as a part of a bundle, and having never heard of it, I was excited to try it out. I was pleasantly surprised by how much fun I had playing it, and then I was unpleasantly surprised when I saw what the normal price is for this game.The controls feel very natural and have a really nice response to them. The plot is interesting and will keep you engaged. However, a large portion of the story is told to you via monologues by the main protagonist, a method I find lazy and disinteresting.All-in-all this game is a lot of fun, and I look forward to circling back and replaying it. I think 29.99 is ridiculous for a game I beat in a little over 5 hours, but maybe I'm entitled. I'd recommend getting this the next time it's on sale.Happy gaming!			"

												Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be the head of a major crime syndicate whilst simultaneously being possessed by a creature of pure evil? Well then this might be the game for you.This is an awesome first person shooter. The gameplay is top-notch, responsive and heart pounding. Each of the guns that you can acquire really packs a punch and you get to see the joy on your enemies faces as you literally blow them away with furious anger and harsh language. Of course the huge arsenal is not the main attraction of this game. That comes in the form of your two tentacle friends and the terrible powers they grant you. First off the tentacles themselves really pack a punch allowing you to execute some very gruesome and disgusting executions; I think there are at least ten, all of which look really cool… If you happen to be a sadist, which we all are. Then there are the powers, eating hearts to gain health, rapid fire explosive bullets and lobbing black holes just to name a few. You will have a ton of fun tearing your way through the city.The creators were going for an art style that was reminiscent of a graphic novel and they really hit the nail on the head. The game is beautiful in its own dark way. The environments were nothing too special but each one had its own feel and lent to the overall bleak atmosphere. As for the story, it was pretty good, nothing too amazing but it allowed the player to exact bloody vengeance and tug at the heart strings as well.Besides the main single player campaign, which only lasts a few hours, there is also a second game mode that can be undertaken in single or multiplayer. In it you get to play as one of four new characters all with their own dark weapons and powers. It added a lot more longevity to the title and with the unique storyline it is well worth a play. I had a go with all the characters to see which one suited me best before blasting my way through everyone who looked at me funny.This game is awesome and frankly it is very underrated. If you pick this up you will find a very enjoyable and bombastic adventure that will have you want to play through a couple times. Even at full price it’s a good title but on sale you would be mad not to pick it up.Have fun  ^_^ "

Comic Gore + Skill TreesOverall Score: 9/10PROSInteresting art style - aims for something uniqueWell established lore and charactersVisceral and intense gameplayConsHas not aged wellShort and easy gameJackie is not edgy anymore :(SummaryOverall a great sequel to a mediocore first game, improved in almost every aspect and went for an art style that, in my opinion highlights and accomodates the gameplay very well. The darkness itself is a well developed character and it is very interesting to see the interactions between Jackie and the darkness, as he tries to supress the darkness and forget previous events most notably  when the darkness held him back as his girlfriend was slaughtered infront of him   which is heavily referanced throughout the game.I would highly recommend picking up this game in a sale, it's a short game with a well developed story, and the skill system adds slight replayability to an otherwise straightfoward game.TL;DR - Pick it up in a sale, you won't regret it "

												The Darkness II it's a straightforward FPS where the only thing that stands out are the visuals. The cell shading graphics makes you feel you are playing a cartoon and they look good most of the times. The campaign it's short and competent, the only  issue was the pacing in some areas where the character thinks he's inside of an asylum and you just have to go from one side to another just to talk to people. C'mon this is a FPS just let me shoot!There are abilites that your character can unlock being the Black Hole the coolest, where it just sucks everyone around it and the effects look good.Anyway don't buy it at full price unless you really want a single-player FPS, get only on a good sale.

												A highly underrated FPS in cel shedad graphics style follows the story of Jackie Estacado whos possesed by the mysterious Darkness , giving himself the ability to QUAD-WIELD weapons and darkness powers. The gameplay is fast and engaging , cuting and gunning down hordes of goons while also executing them with your 'Creeping Dark' power is extremly satisfying and brutal at the same time. The story and the game is fairly linear although you have the freedom to upgrade your skills as you want. There is also a fully flesh out Co-op (up to 4 people) campaign with uniqe character/powers which story is follow closely the main campaigns story (Sadly , no one is playing online anymore so you need a friend for this or you could play it alone as well). This game is not for the faint hearted , thats for sure. - Highly Recommended			"

												In this game, as in most games, you have two hands. You use those two hands to handle and shoot firearms. Up to that point it's pretty standard. The nonstandard part is that you also have two giant demon snakes originating from your shoulders, used to eviscerate people, eat their hearts, impale people with anything big enough to throw, and toss out various demon powers.It's violent fun, and very satisfying.Unfortunately it ends on a cliffhanger and a sequel is never coming.

												This game is damn near perfect. I remember playing the first one on the Play Station 3 and liking it, but it was too slow for me. The NPCs were either uninteresting or straight up not there at all. This game, however, fixed up all the problems I had with the first. The NPCs were awesome, the dialogue between characters was awesome. The voice acting was phenomenal, I can't get over how much I loved Vinnie and Johnny as characters. Whoever voiced Johnny deserves some kind of award for a job well done. The relics you pick up throughout the game give some uneccesary to the plot, but otherwise entertaining lore to the franchise. I can't think of a single dull moment in this game. In a good way, the gameplay felt very fast paced.Only two problems with the game: 1: Campaign was kind of short2: You get a blurry screen for whatever reason. It's supposed to go away shortly; sometimes it does not and it can be pretty frustrating, especially during a fight. Simply press F12 to fix it. You'll be pressing it a lot, however.Overall, this is one of my top First-Person Shooters. A must play.			"

												I don't remember what prompted me to finally pick this game up, but I'm SO glad I finally did. I only played through once and I must say, it was immenselly satisfying. Stabbing, slashing, and throwing people with magical demon arms protruding from my back was more fun than words can describe. I liked having to hide in the dark and using the shadows to my advantage. the guns were pretty insane and the story was pretty intriguing too. I never played the first Darkness game, so I don't know that one's story but I can say that I was pretty hooked all the way through. If you're a fan of gorey first person shooters and slashing people with magical demon arms and voices in your head telling you to kill people and eat their hearts, then don't wait (or wait for a sale and then don't wait) to get this game and hack, slash, and shoot your way through an evil Brotherhood determined to cause chaos and destroy the world all the while learning more about the interesting world of the Darkness and it's version of history. It was only an 8-12 hour long campaign depending on difficulty setting and skill of the player as well as whether one wanted to find all the hidden collectables in the game's stages, but it was intense, action packed, and fun the whole way. Definitely worth my time and money in my opinion			"

												The Darkness 2 is a game that tries to break from the conventional game molds and provide you with something completely unique. The result is a masterpiece, placing it as the best game of 2012 for me.You control Jackie Estacado, a mafia lord who has the power of Darkness itself. The atmosphere of the game and graphics really makes the world vibrant, while the characters are all amazing. From the dialogue to the story, it goes beyond just being solid and keeps you in the whole thing through. A must experience.Gameplay wise is shines just as well. You can control the darkness, represented by 2 serpent heads, through your mouse and keyboard. Between grabbing enemies, blowing them away, beating them down, throwing them, or performing the gruesome finishers you always feel like it's a fun experience. You start off feeling like a god and progress to the more difficult enemies. It works out really well.The biggest downside to the game is that it's very short. You can beat the main campaign in a few hours, but you'll end up going through it a couple of times for the fun achievements and maxing out all of the ability trees that carry over to New Game+. You can play in side missions with other characters that lets you experience a parallel story (ie, While Jackie was doing so and so, these guys were doing this to help). They also have dark powers that are all unique. This can be played in single player on lower difficulties or in co-op on higher. The story is the same for all of them, but it's still a great additional mode.While this game has multiplayer, in my opinion it shines best as a single player experience. The weapons are fun, the enemies are great, the storyline is a masterpiece and the game looks and feels amazing. It's something I feel everyone owes it to themselves to get. The only gripe I could have is that there's no announced sequel or dlc. 10/10 - Get it. It goes on sale for such a low price that it should be a sin not to pick up a copy.			"

												The start up audio is extremely loud despite any sound settings. The game gave me an annoying blur effect glitch throughout the entire experience which made it much more difficult and unpleasant than it had to be since enemies will use light and flashbangs to put blur effects on your screen already. Expect plenty of blurring in the second half of the game. The kill animations are repetitive which is fine except when some of them take much longer than the others to finish (Anaconda vs Head Whip) and become very annoying. The game also really wanted me to use my controller since it didn't respond too well with mouse and keyboard. I didn't know the Darkness being bad news was referring to the port quality. Ohoho.Despite all of that, I finished the game. It's extremely gory, has combat I haven't experienced before (big reason I finished), has a short to medium length, and ends on a huge cliffhanger that left me wanting more, but I don't think there will be a third one (sadness).The combat has you wielding three different guns that you harvest off the dead or find and utilizing the Darkness as you see fit. The general weapon categories are pistols, smgs, rifles, and shotguns. I was a big fan of dual-wielding Desert Eagles. The Darkness on the other hand can pick up and throw various objects and people. You can also grab shields with it, throw your Darkling buddy, perform executions for health, ammo, reduced powers cooldown, summon swarms, enhance your bullets, and much more depending on what you decide to purchase on the four skill trees. You also have your dependable tentacle melee attacks that will slice people in half horizontally and vertically. Making your tentacles, guns, and powers all work together kept me interested in the game along with the revenge style story.Unfortunately, the game has many problems. My problems weren't restricted to my experience either going off of what I read in the hub and in reviews. That's enough to not recommend this title, although, if you're curious, maybe pick it up on sale or if it ever pops up in a bundle again. From the bang for buck perspective, $30 is a very tall order for this title.			"

												Beware, this game promotes and supports feminazism and not even being subtle about it. In some point at game you are being told Darkness can be only in a MALE host while Angelus which is opposite of Darkness, can be only in a FEMALE host. I bet feminists paid 2kgames to make this game as beacon of female supremacy and to mock man and to have another reason to call them evil or♥♥♥♥♥♥supporter. I can see female using it as an arguement ""HEY IF YOU PLAYED DARKNESS 2 AND AT END DIDNT GO TO HELL TO SAVE JENNY, YOU ARE A OPPRESIVE MALE AND A♥♥♥♥♥♥SUPPORTER!11!!ONE!1 FEMINIST POWER1!!!!! EQUALITY OF RACES, BUT ONLY FOR FEMALES, IF MALE IS VICTIM ITS NP CUZ THATS HOW FEMINISM WORKS!11!!ONE!ON!11!!1!!"" ^if i had same IQ level as an average as a feminist, my review and thoughts would be like that, but since i know for a fact that i'm smarter than any feminist ever existed in the universe i dont actually think like that, but that doesnt mean you and I shouldnt hate feminists, they are the most shallow and lame human beings with their incredibly low IQ's, and so called ""EQUALITY"" that works one way only. Anyway TL;DR version of the review, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing epic and everyone should play, it has an amazing story and really creative, fun and violent gameplay, which is amazing. 10/10			"

												While loving the first, The Darkness 2 felt like a disappointment.You are two years later, and are still very much feeling the aftermath. You're a Don now, leading a crime organisation that seems to feel smaller than implied.You go to a restaurant and get attacked by a bunch of janitors. Almost intently, they force you to survive by releasing the Darkness, which Jackie had locked up ever since last time.What follows is a path of revenge. First to retalliate, then avenge your Aunt, then recover a plot-vital artifact... you're basically on a railroad of motivations, which feels artificial.No surprise that the story really isn't engaging.But the surrounding side characters are a redeeming factor. NPC's are often in pairs and have some funny banter. And spamming talk to hear them out leads into a long strain of comments about their own backstory. They may be somewhat shallow characters, but there's a sense of personality to them.In particular, the Darkling seems to be filled with it. He slowly starts to play a big part in the story, and is generally a hoot to listen to. A major improvenemt over the first game.Gameplay wise, what's changed isn't per se for the better.You still have your whip, but it feels much shorter and riskier to use to whip out lights. It relies on your input to see what direction to swipe, which feels counter-intuitive.You can grab a car door or anything shield-like to carry in front of you as protection while you shoot. A great idea at first, but impractical over time, as eating hearts removes the shield and you can't use the whip. Not to mention that the smallest light drops it.Not much of a problem at first, until you start encountering the Brotherhood...Corpses still carry hearts to consume, but living ones serve a different purpose now as well.Instead of four awesome Darkness powers, your powers now largely revolve around stunning an enemy, then grasping him.Upon which you can then decide what to do with them.Mainly, they can serve as a quick health refill, an ammo refill (yep), a shield creator or a cooldown reducer.You also have two active cooldown-based abilities.One is swarm, which briefly blind/stuns your enemy, making them vulnerable. The other briefly infuses your guns with the Darkness, giving you infinite ammo and raised damage. But it's not really a lifesaver.All of this fancy stuff however has to be unlocked first, using points you earn in combat. The fancier the kill, the more points you get.In general, the upgrades are okay. They're nothing spectacular. Although the Darkness armor does look mighty nice. It seems based upon the armor from the comics.In the end, I felt like the Darkness was more of a crutch that slowed me down. I was constantly juggling with my Gunplay and my Darkness powers, annoyingly so.The Brotherhood, which past halfway will be your mainstay enemies, often carry light-beams, which will just annoy the hell out of you. Whenever you are in light now, your screen goes black and white and drop any non-weapon you are holding (such as shields). It's quite disruptive.Not to mention the Whip guys.... These guys will snatch whatever weapon you are holding.Or the shielders who knock you around, while requiring either swarm or multiple whip slashing to be knocked away.Or the Heavy guys that, for some reason, blink around the place whenever they are hurt.These guys get my vote as most-annoying ever.Thankfully you're done with the story in about eight hours.Vendettas seems to largely be a redeeming feature.You can pick one of four that each have one Darkness ability.This is a good thing, as the focus seems to be much more on the gunplay. You still get the annoying light effect, but you feel much less disabled.Quite frankly, I feel like I'm having a much better time in Vendettas.The Darkness 2 is like a bad sequel to a good movie. You cringe, but you can still see what you liked about the original.Get it while it's on sale, play the Single Player on Easy and try and make the best out of it...			"

												Let's start at the very beginning for this one. I played the first Darkness on the 360 until my thumbs went numb. If you played it, you know that the story was compelling, and it was pretty much the only thing that kept you playing it (of course, besides the demon slashing, heart eating, and generally dark ambience), but the gameplay was lacking. Hard.Now, I went into The Darkness II not knowing what to expect, whether it would be a fantastic sequel (hell, all sequels are good, right? ... right?) or yet another crappy game living off of a great story. Well, it turned out to be the former.The storytelling on The Darkness II is near perfection. It is short, granted, but the pacing is godly, and the voice acting is outstanding. The voice of the Darkness, Mike Patton, couldn't be better, portraying the wretchedness of it perfectly. The new gameplay mechanics, including your oh so familiar akimbo mastery and the use of your additional two limbs (which are surprisingly easy to handle) were most definitely a step forward in this title. The upgrade system is a bit lacking, though, but all things considered, it's only a minor setback.The visual style is arguably more simplistic than that of the first game, but it doesn't make it any less enjoyable. The sound in the game is excellent, with weapons as loud as hell, and bone brunching all the way to the end.And if you thought it would get repetitive after a while, never think it, for the multiplayer is there to solve that! Paint the town red with your enemies' blood, slice them up to tiny bits with your demon arm, execute your enemies in gruesome ways and feel the darkness take over you.This is a must-play for any action FPS enthusiast out there.

												This game is a little gem that combines much of the greatness of early era FPS's and modern mechanics. There isn't much to the play through, but ripping someone apart gets more satisfying every time you do it. I was well familiar with The Darkness comics prior to this and the game is a very faithful tip of the hat to the original story. For a very solid and amusing Bioshock-esque story, pick this game up. Especially if it goes on sale.			"

												Controlling the attacks of the darkness tentacles is kind of wonky, they sometimes just do whatever they want. They're also not much of a viable weapon once you hit a certain stage in the game. They just aren't fast enough. It is fun to watch them rip your enemies limb from limb though.The story kind of goes full Bioshock: Infinite. The feels train is at full steam during the later stages of the game near the ending.Word to the weary, you will die. You will die many, many, many times. Once they figure out how to use the light against you♥♥♥♥♥♥gets real very quickly.			"

												Honestly, in this day an age, maybe its my rig but, archaic. BUT. Original darkness was a ♥♥♥♥in Sexy thing. Story, gameplay, story. story. This second one much more stylized, i am gonna beat it again but its still pretty dope. When it came out it was on point. I want a Darkness 3... with more of an emphasis on the originals story telling and cut scences PLUS some better powers. Can be Dishonored esque, but WE WANT JACKIE, and his long lost BAE.

												This is a fairly fun shooter. The dual wielding and tentacle mechanics are fun. The guns feel weighty (though it feels less so at the end of the game where every enemy is coated in armor), the enemies go down in entertaining ways, and the way you and your powers interact with light is great. Especially when enemies start throwing flashbangs or lanterns around. Campaign is fairly short, maybe 5 hours if you interact with everything. If you can get it cheap, it's an entertaining ride.			"

												Very much an improvement from The Darkness (which I felt was a very nice looking game for 2007, but had horrible controls and was not well executed in terms of using your darklings) which is not nearly as much of a comic book style game. For anyone who does not know what The Darkness is, it is a comic book tha tis the defenition of what a bad___ is, and if you don't want to read the comics, then this is the next best thing. So far it has great shadow effects, a confusing story (play the first one or watch it to understand more), and some really awesome action. Reccomended, especially if you like games like Painkiller (and who doesn't?).   "

												A highly underrated game that deserves to be played for the story and gunplay. If you're not into the linear shooter than I guess you should avoid this, but for what it is, the game is an amazing experience. Far too few games nowadays do not come with a good story that actually grasps the player's interest. There are some moments in the game where it seems illogical, like invincible light bulbs(you and the darkness powers are vulnerable in the presence of light), but everything else is pretty darn fun. If you can look past the bugs here and there, the game is worth your time and hopefully a sequel isn't too far around the corner. The multiplayer though, is not very interesting, and is probably best to avoid it and just enjoy the singleplayer story. Now onto the pro's and con's.Pros:Great gunplayFun and awesome powers New game+lovely storyVisuals are neatCons:Some bugs here and there, I got quite a bit of visual bugsI don't think the darkling is used enough besides throwing himLinear? May be a con for some, but I enjoyed the pacing.Fairly shortInvincible light bulbs			"

												Somebody will be upset over the comparisons I'm about to make to describe this game *SMH* This games single player mode is utterly fun, AND hilarious, it's like they combined 1a the really good recent ""stereotype"" mobsters/Mafia games, with one of the recent console ""have Dark/Evil powers+ mutant body parts"" (I'd be more specific, but We all know the two games I mean) games. This Co. used to be part of Sega, and that quality shows, the game looks, sounds, plays, and runs awesome, PLUS unlike lots of games it is FUN to play. Personally I purchased this game because I know 2K games don't make junk, AND because I wanted to play the online 4 player mode, and it's UTTERLY cool, but I was so suprised by the story mode that I'll surely finish that too. The online ""Vendetta"" modes are great, if you pick the story 1, it's like playing through Saints Row IV (don't hate Me), with the most stereotyped 4 chars from Saints Row 2 (ALL good things), in a city that's cool, and realistic looking, you can revive your team-mates if they die, you get powers, and buffs you purchase with skillpoints you gain from killing mobs, the mobs and feal of the game is also reminding Me of the latest Devil May Cry game, Yes the Co-Op modes are short, but if you turn the difficulty up they last longer, & gives you a better sense of accomplishment.Personally I hate the ""We're to lazy to make a conformant texture clamp that works well on the player model skins, so We CARTOON-OUTLINED them"", but it's only on the player skins, and not the world, so you hardly notice, The contrast is so high it'll make your eyes bleed with the awesome job they did on the lighting, & overall feel/look of the game. It'll run on any old PC, and even looks good with everything turned on low, in the lowest rez. So If you like games to just chill awhile, N blast through a Co-Op that ROCKS, or a cool story mode that's VERY entertaining, this game's worth it at normal price, so get it on sale ☺			"

												The game is short, I beat it in 8 hours and I was not trying to rush in any way.  That being said, my time with it was a joy in both multiplayer and singleplayer.  Dodging the light to stay in the darkness is an interesting and unique mechanic.  The fact that you essentially have another arm with your darkness powers adds a layer of depth(you can duel weild guns while holding a shield with the darkness).  It's a gruesome game and you feel like a dark god of vengence as you go through it, you feel powerful but challenged which is an interesting blend.  You have to eat hearts with the tentacles for health but it doesn't impede your movement in any way, just a cool thing to watch the tentacle reach out and do it while you are shooting.  Oh and your guy is a good guy.  One of the main detractors that kept me from buying the game for a long time was I thought he was this super evil guy that was just killing people for fun, he's a good guy that is getting revenge, like the punisher or max payne. Overall great game.			"

												This is a heavy tale full of gore and brutality; a trail of blood and people torn to pieces, but also about love. Resist the darkness corruption and feel the impact of violence as it often conflicts with humor and it's taken as normal.Main campaign is nice, Vendettas campaign could be better (still a plus), characters and story are interesting.Overall, a good game! By the way, have you ever watched that movie ""What Dreams May Come"", from 1998?  Feels like the game and the movie are related, yet antagonic.*Put your volume level down if you use headphones: 2K´s intro was a bit too loud when I played it.			"

												as i loved The Darkness on PS3 when i was about the age of 16. That game was preety insense as i wondered how anyone could do a game for ""Darkness"" as this was quite knew you would be the ""Bad"" guy. The Darkness 2 lost a bit of the Athmosphere due to its cartoon shadering still it looks really nice and i think as long as you play the uncut version it dont lose much!The Story of The Darkness is quite Interesting as i would also recommend the Coop campain to get a bit more info about the story as you will not only get story lines from the main campain! also playing with others a coop was nice as you can choose 1 of 4 chars. but if you consider getting into the coop to start with a similar high difficult as i was playing don on main i could not even start with highter than normal or else i would find myself dying over and over again as long as you dont have the skill or acknowledge on top to know your char to use.so far i found the main campain to easy the coop was more challenging which i loved!i hope there will proably be a Darkness 3 but i searched for it and it seems due to bad selling of Darkness 2 it wont be released unless we the player try to push em to release a 3rd game. as i would also love to see more of the story between jenny/Jacky.oh btw of lol is this? every char named jacky dye a lot? Sleeping Dogs, The Darkness and so on. that name is somewhat cursed in games XD------------------------------------------------------------------------| Here is list how i would give points for the game in each categorie: |------------------------------------------------------------------------Gameplay: 9/10 (pretty good as the first one)Graphics: 8/10 (i personally dislike the Cartoon Shadering a lot but it also isnt a thing that should keep you away from this awesome piece of game!)Support: ?/10 (game worked fine and smooth never needed)Price: 8/10 (6 hours until my first main run was completed.. woudlnt say it worth the full 30€ but about 10€ would be oke i think as even that would be over 1€ per hour. game is preety expensive compared to other games. still very good and worth buying anyway)Story: 9/10 (confusing and as i never finsihed actually the 1st game i cant say ""continued"", but i hope this will be continued as it was super intersting was happens in the end!) Sound: 9/10 (fits the situation, the speakers are good i could quite get into the game was felling bad for jacky/jenny in the end..)Performance: 10/10 (perfect run, even when recording/playing and converting had stable 60 FPS shows me its good coded one)FAZIT: 8.8/10 (well coded game, worth buying and playing!)

												Darkness II is a hack & slash & shoot game with really cool and fun abilities. You got the power of The DarknessYou are head of the crime family. You got awesome ""tentacles"" coming from your back that basically wreck anything apart.You get ""Dark Essence"" from executions, kills collectable relics. You can use that essence for new abilities or upgrades.This game has an interesting story of Jackie Estecado ( you ) trying to take down a society called ""The Brotherhood"", who wants The Darkness from you. Jackie is desperate to get her old girlfriend back who was killed by Jackie controlled by Darkness. The game also has ""Vendettas"" mode.

Its a spray and pray game and also you have those to snake hydra things. Its fun and makes you feel like a badass but is by no means the best game in the world. If you enjoy games where you run around and murder everyone is the most goriest way possible, then this is the game for you.			"

												Short but sweet. I started playing this with a controller, just so I could play it on my TV, but honestly, a controller just doesn't work. Or you must have played a lot of console FPS already, then you might get used to it. So I switched back to my normal monitor. This game looks astonishing. I love the cel shaded graphics, they're detailed and the gore looks great in motion. The animations were great as well. One thing they should've looked into was the FOV. It's all messed up so there's a good chance you might actually get sick because of it. I did hear they were working on that though.The voiceovers and music were brilliant as well. I especially loved the music of the ending, and the voice of The Darkness.But... like most FPS these days, this is a short game. It will take about 6 hours to finish, then you can start New Game+ if you want. Or play the co-op missions, your choice. I started over after finishing it. The shooting and killing in general just feel right ♥ ![Rating: 90/100]			"

												This is one of the few FPS in recent history that I've legitimately enjoyed. The story isn't the most interesting thing ever, and it is rather short, but it keeps moving at a brisk pace, and several unexpected things happen along the way. I loved the asylum levels in particular.The graphics are pretty good (especially given the low requirements), and the voice acting is really well-done. The darkness powers are rather interesting, and add quite a bit to the battles. You can level up the ones you use, and ignore the ones you don't. Picking up poles or shields and tossing them at enemies is crazy fun, and you can swipe with the darkness arms while you reload, etc. There are a few cover-shooting sections, but there are also several frantic wide-open brawls with large groups of enemies.There are numerous multiplayer modes, as well as New Game+, so you should get your money's worth out of it. I certainly did.			"

												Darkness II is a hack & slash & shoot game with really cool and fun abilities. You got the power of The DarknessYou are head of the crime family. You got awesome ""tentacles"" coming from your back that basically wreck anything apart.You get ""Dark Essence"" from executions, kills collectable relics. You can use that essence for new abilities or upgrades.This game has an interesting story of Jackie Estecado ( you ) trying to take down a society called ""The Brotherhood"", who wants The Darkness from you. Jackie is desperate to get her old girlfriend back who was killed by Jackie controlled by Darkness. The game also has ""Vendettas"" mode. It's Co-Op (and SP) where you play as other character who have partial powers of Darkness.Relics can be collected. There are 29 total. They are not hard to find, which is good.

												This is what I call a great FPS.You don't need to have read the comic books to understand this story of revenge and lost love. While it is short (5 hours on the Hard setting), it is really interesting and entertaining thanks to great characters and voice acting.The gameplay is where the game truly shines: shooting baddies with a Desert Eagle in a hand and a Ump in the other while throwing a spear with a demonic arm and slashing in half a guy with the other arm is really something marvelous. There is plenty of gore, with some really gruesome executions.The music is okay, neither bad nor memorable.Overall, it's one of my favourite FPS thanks to great gameplay and story. Plus, you can play 6 missions coop with three other friends.SCORE: 90/100P.S. Feel free to add me if you want to do the coop campaign			"

												The original Darkness was more .. well, dark and depressive. The sequel has more action and gore, but that doesn´t necessarily mean it´s a bad thing. Actually, it means quite the opposite. It is a ride from the beginning to the end, and boy how fun it is! Too bad it´s quite short. I finished the game twice and I was enjoying it the same as I played this the first time. I seriously hope that there will be the third part.8/10Jednička byla temná a depresivní. Tohle je víc akčnější, ale to neznamená, že je to špatně. Naopak, je to jízda od začátku do konce, a jaká! Škoda té krátkosti.

												This is a fairly fun shooter. The dual wielding and tentacle mechanics are fun. The guns feel weighty (though it feels less so at the end of the game where every enemy is coated in armor), the enemies go down in entertaining ways, and the way you and your powers interact with light is great. Especially when enemies start throwing flashbangs or lanterns around. Campaign is fairly short, maybe 5 hours if you interact with everything. If you can get it cheap, it's an entertaining ride.			"

This game is mainly driven by the story, although you do get to pew pew, their isn't a huge amount of guns to choose from but the game is quiet short, ~5 hours for the main storyline, plus it has a new game+ and ""Vendettas"" which include hit list missions and a campaign focusing around 4 characters with powers like Jackie, they can be done offline or in online co-op. Personally this game made me get emotional. Give it a shot, it's amazingly good.""DON'T LET IT DECEIVE YOU!""			"

It is just very disappointing to see it hasn't been patched for the past 2-3 years, as I always thought of steam as a very reliable site.

												One of the better fps games I've ever played. Solid, unflinching combat mechanics, great graphics, cool story, and a lot of fun to play. Not only can you dual wield weapons, you have two demon arms that come out of you to slash and grab enemies and do gruesome executions, and you can grab items and throw them at enemies. The ultra-violence in this game knows no limits. Another big plus: the story is easily one of the best video game stories I've ever seen. Simple to grasp yet very well written and well acted, even sad at times. The graphics are also very well done and hold up well today even as of 2016, with a almost Borderlands-ish comic style. But things look more human-like and the game is much more serious than BL games, and it manages to feel like its own style of art.If you like well made FPS games that feel nice and tight when you play them, like a young, hot, 18yr old super-long haired red head prom date with a quiver in her panties that you can feel on your leg while dancing, quit waiting and go for it.Gameplay 9/10Graphics 8/10Effects 8/10Performance 10/10Sounds/music 9/10Story 10/10Length 9/10Replay value 7/10Level of Violence 10/10Technical problems: none for me/108.5/10 one of my fav fps games			"

												There's not really much to say. It's a shooter. It does all the things a shooter should do, and it does have a feature to make it unique. In this case, giant evil tentacles that have all sorts of powers.If it's on sale, go ahead and get it, but these games are never really made around replayability.			"

												A fun, quick little game. 6 hours of excessive power fantasy violence. More with newgame+ and the non-storyline missions that come with the game. There are a few twists in the story that really caught me off guard and had me questioning my decisions. The art style is timeless, character development is a solid A+, and the gunplay is solid. Definately worth picking up on sale. only cons are an annoying sidekick, and i had to reload a checkpoint when he glitched out once while opening a door.			"

And when the darkness tells you to do bad things it adds to the ambiance of insanity going on in Jackies head!! I would recommend this 100%!!!			"

In my opinion, its not as good as Darkness 1, but that game is brilliant in my opinion. You don't really need to play Darkness 1 to play Darkness 2 at all, but I highly reccomend it. Multiplayer Co-op was decent, and the challenges were fun too. There is replay value here, and a ""New Game+"" for extra stuff. Go get this game now!			"

												I love the Darkness II, it has awesome gameplay, your movement and the fighting mechanics feel super smooth. There is a fun and exciting multiplayer co-op mode! The achievements keep you coming back for more and gives you just another reason for another run-through of the game. HOWEVER, Darkness II has one downside, the length of the game, both single player and especially co-op is all played through within a very short time. Id love to be able to play the normal Story as co-op or have some form of expansion of the game after the normal run through. Beating the game on the more intense difficulty or grinding Achievements is less awarding than more content, but non the less I love this game and highly recommend it!			"

												I really enjoyed this game. At the time of writing I have 8 hours play time and I've finished the storyline which shows how short of a game it is, especially since I didn't rush it. The only two issues I have with this game as a whole are that (again) the storyline is extremely short and that it is relatively easy. I played through the game on the second highest difficulty and I encountered no problems with any levels. The game is extremely gorey which I personally didn't find an issue but it won't be to some people's tastes. However the gameplay is solid and the story is brilliant with plenty of depth and makes you want to continue playing to find out more.  9/10, would strongly recommend (also remember to watch right to the end of the credits, there's an extra clip that adds a lot to the story)			"

												First of all, I like the Darkness ll. It's a game that's linear and typical in terms of envrionment design, but oh so fun to play when it comes to story and gameplay.The Darkness is the ultimate weapon, you can use it to melee, grab, and literally tear apart enemies. I love the idea of relying on the dark to access the darkness abilities. You can upgrade your powers using points gathered through kills and finding collectibles. The weapons are awesome, quite a few to choose from and they all sound great and make a great addition to the darkness powers.There are several choices throughout the story as well. The character animations bring the characters to life and the enemies act like living breathing people rather than dull AI that just tries to kill you.The cell shaded graphics are something I'm not a fan of, but they still pull off a good looking game world.Only two things I don't like about The Darknesss ll:1.) The small scale levels.2.) Its short single player campaign.			"

												If you've played the first game you're going to notice a few things.1.) The visual style. Depending on your preference this is either a good or a bad thing. Personally, I preferred the more realistic style in the first game, it just made it feel much darker and gritty (which is what you'd expect out of a game called ""The Darkness""). I can see why they did it, as the franchise is based on a comic. 2.) The music. Remember the epic metal-orchestral soundtrack that featured when you were ripping everything apart? Well, that's not there any more. Compare this: 


YouTube™ Video: The Darkness [Music] - Massacre On The Lighthouse 

			Views: 135,969		

			http://www.2kgames.com/thedarkness/		

 with this: 


YouTube™ Video: The Darkness II Soundtrack - I Got My Gun Again 

			Views: 11,055		

			Soundtrack von The Darkness II Titel: I Got My Gun Again		

 and you'll get what I mean. It's good, but it just doesn't have enough ""oomf"" behind it for my liking.3.) Very linear. The pseudo-free-roam that was present in the first game is gone too, everything narrows you down a linear path. Sure there are some ""choices"" that you make that effect some things, but that's pretty much it.In summary: fun gameplay, iffy style.			"

												Overall a very good game, nothing particularlly new here but everything is well executed* the story is interesting enough to keep you engaged and the gameplay is solid. The art style is the real winner here. The first The Darkness suffered from poor visuals and blockly looks along with a light mechanic that was cool in concept but not so much in gameplay. All that is fixed by simply cell shading everything.The fluidity of the combat is very impressive as well, you'll go from shooting guys in the face to disembowling them with your claws to ripping car doors off of cars for cover all without missing a beat. There is great attention paid to detail in the level design and non consequential objects placed around the levels. Voice acting is surprisingly good. The length of the main campaign is maybe a little short for $30, but if you catch it on sale for $25 or less I'd say you'll get your money's worth.Overall a very enjoyable time was had playing and I'll probably fork over a couple of bucks for DLC if and when it hits, assuming it's single player content.*Only gripe is a bug that doesn't like to let you walk through doorways that require crouching (ventilation shafts, tunnels, you know the type if you've played a shooter since Goldeneye). You have to disable the Vsynch or enable it. Doesn't matter which, you just have to change it to walk through the door and change it back to get through another one. It doesn't happen often, but it sucks you right out of the game when it does.			"

												The Darkness II was one of those games I finished without ever getting up from the PC, literally. First, because its really catching, but second because it's also really short. I easily managed to fit in those 5h playtime between lunch and dinner.  The Darkness II is amazing, and one of the best games I played in a while. Its not necessary to have played the first part to get the story, but I am going to buy it now. I easily immersed into the story and all the characters are well made and believable. Overall it was well written and it all fitted together. I also love the musik.Surprisingly the game run perfectly fine without ever lagging on my old Computer. I never found any performance issues and still the graphics are amazing. This games gets a 9,5/10 rating. The minuses are short campaign, repetitive bossfights and sometimes stupid AI.			"

												Hello darkness, my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping Left its seeds while I was sleeping And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains Within the sound of silence In restless dreams I walked alone Narrow streets of cobblestone 'Neath the halo of a street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light That split the night And touched the sound of silence And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people maybe more People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs that voices never shared No one dared Disturb the sound of silence ""Fools,"" said I, ""you do not know Silence like a cancer grows Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach you"" But my words like silent raindrops fell And echoed in the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayed To the neon god they made And the sign flashed out its warning In the words that it was forming And the sign said ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls And tenement halls And whispered in the sound of silence""			"

												I absolutely loved the first Darkness, developed by Starbreeze. The Darkness 2 absolutely matches the amazingness of the first game. Digital Extremes, I REALLY hope you are the developers behind The Darkness 3 if there ever is one. The Darkness 2 is an absolutely phenomenal game in every way. The only nitpick I have is that its a bit short(I beat it in 6.8 hours), but my god it was so good I don't even care. BUY THIS GAME! 10/10!			"

												This game really is a special game, and honestly very underrated. The story has you playing as a guy named ""Jackie"" who has his entire world ripped out from beneath his feet. So many twists and turns and the way the narrative is told in this game is extremely immersive. You will really begin to sympathize with the main character. On top of the story being one of the best I've played, the actual gameplay itself is something very unique. Just look at some of the gameplay on the steam store. It may look overwhelming but it is actually really easy to use and the skill trees are very varied, enough so that if you enjoyed it enough you could even think about playing it through a second time.

												I got this game in a Humble Bundle, and it's pretty awesome. My current computer doesn't run it well on medium, but the options let you play the game at a lower resoultion while keeping it 16:9. The gameplay itself is simple enough and well-explained for a beginner FPS player like me, but it does lack variety. The thing I like about the game the most, so far, is the characters, especially the Darkness. The voice of the Darkness keeps it simple, psychotic, and hilarious: FEED. The darkling makes it funny while talking down to you like GlaDOS as you follow him around. Overall, I think the game is great and I have a fun time playing.			"

												8/10 - good game, a bit short but really, really funYou can tear people apart, slice them in pieces, impale them on metal rods and all sorts of fun executions on top of applying some generous amount of lead in their body. The gameplay revolves around controlling your player's dark powers that will allow you to grab objects or bodies and throw them, with the small (but very annoying) limit that your powers only work in the ""dark"". There's a fair bit of shooting people in the face with your usual FPS weapons, including the pretty neat dual wield of different lightweight guns, meaning you can shoot people with a UMP45 and a M1911 to make sure you empty both your pistol and SMG ammo pools in a jiffy. Also, a british as balls sidekick that is a buttload of fun to hear.You can of course purchase upgrades and new powers, that will increase the power of your bullets, let you see through walls, stun enemies or rip them apart in new and exciting ways.The storyline picks up after the first game (that I never played, thanks console exclusives) and is pretty nice. It begs for a sequel though, that will probably never happen considering it hasn't been announced yet.On top of that SP mode (and its New Game+ option that allows you to start the game with your upgrades - a great way to make the hardest difficulty mode a little bit less frustrating), there's a coop mode where you assume the role of one of the 4 totally stereotypical, borderline racist characters available in that mode. Each character has a new ability: the chinese dude has a katana, the jew girl has a really neat pistol/shotgun/bringer of death, the black healer guy can throw people in the air and the irish guy can throw an axe on top of reusing one of the SP mode's PC abilities. It's possible to rip and tear with your friends!Technically, the game looks pretty good but the performance is all over the place. Sometimes the framerate tanked as low as 15 FPS while on some other places of the same level it was above 100 FPS.Overall, the game is pretty short but nevertheless good.Did I mention you can destroy people? Like, put one of your demonic arms in their butt and pull their spine out?			"

												I really enjoyed this game. At the time of writing I have 8 hours play time and I've finished the storyline which shows how short of a game it is, especially since I didn't rush it. The only two issues I have with this game as a whole are that (again) the storyline is extremely short and that it is relatively easy. I played through the game on the second highest difficulty and I encountered no problems with any levels. The game is extremely gorey which I personally didn't find an issue but it won't be to some people's tastes. However the gameplay is solid and the story is brilliant with plenty of depth and makes you want to continue playing to find out more.  9/10, would strongly recommend (also remember to watch right to the end of the credits, there's an extra clip that adds a lot to the story)			"

												Not a bad game except this :SERIOUSLY, I finished it in hard mode in less than 5 fkg hours !!!5 hours for a game which has a multiplayer mode without anyone in lobbies...So I guess u can buy it if you are bored and it only costs 5euros.I'm getting sick of those FPS with a campagne mode during less than 10 hours.What a waste of money !

												This might be one of my new favorite games that I have on steam. The gameplay is great, the atmosphere is great, the character interaction is great, and the darkling, don't even get me started on him, he was amazing, he was funny, and was fun as hell to play as. If you enjoy constant violence and gore, this is the game for you. Have fun everyone!			"

												This game was really nice to get during the 2K Humble Bundle, but similarly, only when it is under $5. I didn't go at this at the hardest difficulty, and timed a good five hours or so. If you're looking for a pretty decent story out of this, don't expect it. As for the story, the main character has PTSD from his girlfriend dying, only to realize that he might very well just be delusional as hell. See for yourself what truly happens. As far as gameplay go, it's really tedious. They throw the same kind of enemies around, some enemies just requiring more shots through the skull to finish up. Well worth the money though.			"

												I got to give this a 5/10 because I encountered a game breaking bug. It was fun up until that point too. Score might have been higher if I could finish it.And there are some spoilers here to tell you about the bug.About midway through the game when you get to the brothel and you are crawling through the vents there is at least 3 times where the vent changes, from a grill to normal vent for example. Each time it does this the change in vent type is slightly taller than the one youre standing on, so you collide with it, you can barely jump over the first two but the third one is impossible to pass, due to the fact youre in a vent and cant jump very high.So I never got to finish this game and I never will.

												I absolutely loved the first game, so I thought I would enjoy this one as well. I was sadly mistaken... They took away all of the fun powers and left in the worst. Furthermore, they said ""screw it"" to actually using your powers in interesting and fun ways. Now its just one mindless, repetitive gun battle, throughout the entirety of the game. I remember in the first game, being able to use your power that was like a snake, busting all the lights, stealthily eliminating the guards and actually having some tact. But not in this game. Bottom line, they removed all of the fun and we were left with another mindless FPS that left me highly disappointed.  The only things good that I can say about this game are as follows - 1 - The graphics are nice looking.2 - The storyline is pretty good. Though it still falls short of the first game.3 - . . . . I actually have no idea what to say here because the rest was awful. Buy it for $5 or less and only if you played the first game and want to see how the story unfolds. If you're new to the series, don't even bother with this. Play the first game as it's far more solid than this junk.			"

												A fun linear FPS with great RPG elements and cool story with unique art style. The shooting mechanics are there and the demonic powers keep the pace fast and exciting by repleshing your HP and executing enemies to keep you going without sitting behind cover for too long. I personally went with a relatively lame build that emphasized ammo efficientcy and gun power so I didnt explore the more magic casting aspect but the story is very interesting and has great twists. A bit short and low on actual content but what is actually there is great and enjoyable, theres just not too much of it even if you want more.			"

												Has some unique gameplay elements, is brutal and provoking at times. However, checkpoint system is really bad, with many swarms of enemy being dolled at you up to 5 guys at a time which are very fast to kill you. Not to mention they are also bullet sponges and they have really awkward hitboxes making headshots more difficult to pull off than they should. The game looks awful at native resolutions without a super/multi-sample solution in-game, and the control scheme works much better with a gamepad.That being said, you don't need to worry about not playing the first game to get the jist of this one. The combat is other-wise very fast-paced at times, with enemys constantly dropping big ""health packs"" to keep you going through the firefights.(Sometimes the checkpoints will mess with this mechanic) And despite my complaints, I feel like I got spoiled from the $1 Humble Bundle this came in. It's definitely a game that deserves to be played, though $30 is WAY to much to ask for, considering its age and I say you should definitely wait for a sale.			"

												This game seriously kicks hard, this is such an amazing successor to the hidden awesome gem of an original. Looking totally different this time trying to get the look, touch and style of the comic books. This time you can use your darkness tentacles for much better use and with superior combat. Game rides an interesting story but it doesn't out do the original's though. Keeps up the top-notch voice acting from the original, introducing new voice actors or voices from the original voice actors. This game had quite a decent bit of replayability. A pretty decent co-op campaign, vendettas and hitlists. The only thing that let's this down is it's generally short campaign, though it's not that bad ""6-7 hours"" but with the co-op campaigns it adds ""3-4 hours"" so altogether it's around ""9-11"" hours which is not bad at all. This game was so much kickass fun, I just have to reccommend it. This and the original are some of my favorite games of all time. Totally recommended and fun as hell.			"

Controls feel best designed for a controller but are easy to understand and execution of the multitude of techniques in your repertoire is effortless. The sound design is perfect for each mood, hair-raisingly chilling at some times and bleeding with sorrow at others. I could get stuck in this game time and time again and I'm glad there is replay value within single player with achievements, Vendetta mode, and online gameplay.			"

												So me, Johnny the Knife and Rodrigo the Snake was attendin' sunday mass. And there was those creepy lookin' guys there: all dressed up in black, huge guys, I didn't know'em, but I knew they was hitmen of some sorts. With tatoos all over the place and some wicked cross upside down I could see one the sleeve of one of em. I knew the other guys saw 'em, too and THEY saw us. I had no idea man, they was watchin' us all the time and we was gettin' ready for a fight. And they sure as hell would bring one down on us.The priest goin all fire and brimstone today. Like hell wasn't a made up story to keep us in line, but a REAL place, where each of us could end up. Finally we were gettin up for singin when all of a sudden BOOM! the church doors crashed open! Next thing you know some crazy hail of bullets was rainin all over the place! And before anyone had any ♥♥♥♥in' clue what the crap was goin on, those huge guys, they was droppin' like flys. Just like that! They went down like rocks in the river. So we thought it was some kind of hitman, you know, from another family, crashin the party. But then I saw IT! All of us was takin cover behind the curch benches and between the screamin deaths of two of those giants there was some...some kind of tentacle, a snake, hell I don't know. It had glowin' eyes! Black skin and big ♥♥♥♥in teeth! And it was rippin them apart like some crazy anaconda-cobra from hell. I thought I was goin crazy. Everyone was screamin, like their ♥♥♥♥in soul was on the line! The priest shouted: ""IT IS SATAN! IT IS SATAN!""Then Rodrigo got hit! I was tryin to get to him, but out of nowhere the whole room got filled with one mean swarm of ♥♥♥♥ed up bugs. Huge, disgusting monsterbugs! Everyone got stung and stunned. And then...this THING jumped on Johnnys back! Poundin him like a ragin gorilla. Laughin while it did it. First thing I did as soon as I could move again was runnin for my god damn life! I crawled and hid behind the altar. The priest was dead: lied there in his own blood, the robe  wrapped around his shredded face. I looked for side exits, or a ladder, anything! But then...then IT jumped right at the altar!! I tried to scream, but couldn't. It was a demon, a fallen angel, a beast, it was...THE DARKNESS!! As I was gettin ready to die, I screamed: ""WHAT ARE YOU!?"" Deadcertain those would be my last words. But then, out of this cloud, appeared a face! It was a man...! And all cool, like death itself, he said with a smooth voice: ""I...am the hero! And you will not die today."" I was starin in his face, unable to say a single word. Suddenly I could hear another boomin voice, like it was in my own god damn head, I thought it came from his tentacles. And they raged: ""WE WANT ITS HEART! FEED US! FEED US ITS HEART!""

												In my opinion , This game is a Gem, I'll keep this review short for you, i got it from a Humble 2k Bundle along with other games,]  [If you are thinking of buying it in the humble bundle or really cheap, and love violent and Heavy metal inspiured games, don't hesitate to buy it] Story - Surprisingly good, Really enjoyed the Psychological element to it (i wont say much) :3 Gameplay - Awesome , The more you play the more you will enjoy it , The guns are all diverse and have gritty satisfying sounds and feel to them Graphics - This game is Cell Shaded [Borderlands looking] , and in my opinion the graphics and artwork is beautiful , really good and easy to run since its quite an old game but looks amazing. Characters - The characters and voice acting is pretty damn good, it's definetely not a AAA game but i think that the characters were definetely interesting enough to keep me playing until the end :) [There is also a little demon imp that follows you around with a very thick british accent and is the comic relief in this game, hes pretty cool XD] - [The Game took me 6 hours to finish] "

												The Darkness 2 is, as the name implies, pretty ♥♥♥♥ing dark.You play as Jackie Estacado, a mobster whose special skills have allowed him to rise to the very top of the New York underworld. And by 'special skills,' I am of course referring to the ancient demonic entity that lives within his body.But when a bunch of cultists show up and try to steal the power away from him (because if an ordinary guy can use it to become king of the Mafia, imagine what someone with actual ambition could do with it), Jackie must use his eldritch abilities, and a veritable ♥♥♥♥load of increasingly large guns, to defend himself and prevent the power from falling into the wrong hands.I'll be honest, I was surprised by how much I liked this game. I picked it up expecting a standard shooter with a vaguely gothic design aesthetic. What I wasn't expecting was a genuinely inventive and unique game with solid gameplay and some smart ideas bubbling under the surface. There are some very creative moments throughout the campaign, first as Jackie explores some strange locations, and then later when the demonic presence starts to drive him insane. The ending also qualifies for the 'Holy ♥♥♥♥ing Christ' award of totally unexpected story turns.The gameplay is the standard gory shooter, but with the twist of dark and brutal abilities. You have two demonic tentacles which can pick up and throw things independant of your two gun-hands, which led to several situations where I was fighting two battles at once- a mid-range skirmish with a pair of SMGs, and also a long-range stand-off in which I was lobbing sharp objects and spikes at snipers.You also get health by eating hearts that you tear out of dead bodies, which means the only way to get your way out of a tight spot is to use progressively riskier tactics to kill enemies and regain the upper hand.Overall, it's a surprisingly enjoyable game with some creative uses of mechanics to craft a campaign that is not only fun to play, but fun as an experience.Final score: 8/10.

												Short version with 0 spoliers:  The Darkness II is a good but short game.Long version possibly containing spoilers:  On the brightside if you're like me, you didn't play The Darkness and just happened to come across The Darkness II while it was on sale and decided it would be worth a play.  I opened the game with kind of low expectations because it just look liked Hatred with a bit more of a story behind it with demons and♥♥♥♥♥♥  Little did I know that I would be hearing a lot of familiar voices from Mafia II.  I'll start it off by talking a bit about the controls in this game, I assume the game was meant to be operated with a controller because the attacking with darkness via the mouse is very clunky, but not clunky to the point that the game is made easy, otherwise it controls like a typical FPS.  The integration of The Darkness made the gameplay more interesting than the typical FPS luckily.  The graphics aren't even bad considering the 2012 release period.  Getting more into the story element part of the review, I have to say that the storyline took me a bit by surprise, it's not as emotional as it could be given the situation but otherwise the dialogue is well written and is even at some parts, humorous.  The little sidekick you get is probably one of my favorite parts of the game, aside from the intense gore which isn't even really that intense but it's definitely what drove me through the game.  One part in particular which is after you finish killing a boss.  Now to the one but small point that kind of bothered me, turns out this game is super short.  I beat the whole main story in one hour, there is side coop stuff you can do with friends and♥♥♥♥♥♥but I, a friendless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, really don't care about that now do I?  Eh small complaint, still a good game worth checking out.			"

												While I'm not saying that the Darkness 2 is a bad game, there are plenty of other ways to spend your time. Honestly this is just a generic console arcade FPS with a few gimmics thrown in to move copies. Whatever they are charging is way too much. Gameplay is challenging but generic and I feel as if I have wasted my time playing it. Please play something else instead. Modern Warfare 2 is a much better choice.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE ON MAC.If not, then I WOULD RECOMMEND this game. From what little I could see, the game was pretty fun.I would love to give this game a positive review, but I can't. I downloaded it on my mac, started playing, and as soon as I unlocked the darkness powers, it stopped working. The bottom half of my screen was covering in a yellow mist, making the game unplayable. I searched the forums for a solution, BUT THERE IS NONE. According to forums, about 1/2 of all mac users encounter nearly game breaking bugs. Do not take that chance. It seems that even if you have the most updated system, it still might not work.Again, if you're on pc, game should be good.			"

												This game has the potential to be fun, but graphical the glitches ruin it.  The screen gets blurry for no reason and the only way to fix it is to restart the game or change resolution.  This is a temporary fix and seems to only last about 10-20 minutes  before it does the same thing again.  I have no problems with any other game I have so I am reluctant to accept that it is my computer's fault.  looks like it's time to throw this one on the♥♥♥♥♥♥games pile.			"

												The Darkness II is a story of what could have been. It could have had a longer game, more varied enemies, and better gun play. It had a good concept and art style. The characters worked for the universe. They should really port The Darkness 1 to PC, to complete the series. Last $30 (as of 6/1/15) is grossly overpriced for such a short game. I can't recommend until the price is below $10. 7/10, buy when it is cheap and have lower expectations.			"

												This game is highly overrated in my opinion. This is yet again one of these games in witch i do not mannage to play or enjoy no matter how hard i try. The gameplay and controls were some of the worst i have seen from any tripple A game ever. And that is not mentioning the graphics and the main characters whos first impression slaughtered the game for me instantly, i can barly think of a worse protagonist based of the begining. The game tries a bit too hard to be dark and dramatic, but the narrow camera and again wierd controlls just make this game fell wierd and broken.I do not recomend this game in any way considering who it is made by who i in general have huge respect for. I´d go as far as to say i personaly think this is 2K Games worst game of those i have played.However due note i haven´t played much and my PC has never been exactly tip top but the first impression of this game slaughtered any enjoyment i fell i can ever have from it.For the pricetag of this game it´s seriously not worth it in my opinion.

												The Darkness 2 game is loosely based on the comic incarnation of the Darkness, but the loose interpretation is fine and doesn't detreact from the game.  It's fun for a few hours, but has limited lifespan and very limited replay-ability.  If you can get this on deep discount then you won't begrudge paying a few quid for a few hours of entertainment, but I cannot recommend this at full price.So what's good:> fun slashing everything up with your demon limbs> comic-style visuals, similar to Borderlands> you play an evil b*st*rd in a world full of similarly evil b*st*rds, and sometimes it's fun to be the bad guyWhat's not so good:> it's a frenetic hack / slash / shoot 'em up with very little progression or thought.  Your tactics don't change much from the start and with only a few different types of enenmies, it quickly becomes repetative> there's a big issue with the depth of field - at certain points in the game the screen goes blurry for a scripted event.  Fine... but it often doesn't 'unblur' afterwards, and frenetic action when you can't see what's going on isn't fun.  This isn't just me, just google 'Darkness 2 depth of field' and see.> does help if you know the Darkness from the comicThe real pity is that it's a great idea, which has been rushed out of the door before it's ready.

												If you've played the first game you're going to notice a few things.1.) The visual style. Depending on your preference this is either a good or a bad thing. Personally, I preferred the more realistic style in the first game, it just made it feel much darker and gritty (which is what you'd expect out of a game called ""The Darkness""). I can see why they did it, as the franchise is based on a comic. 2.) The music. Remember the epic metal-orchestral soundtrack that featured when you were ripping everything apart? Well, that's not there any more. Compare this: 


YouTube™ Video: Review - The Darkness 2 

			Views: 119		

			The real halloween review and its a short one but the game is quite good. Darkness 2 for last gen and PC.		

 with this: http://youtu.be/6OE4oDR3K5U and you'll get what I mean. It's good, but it just doesn't have enough ""oomf"" behind it for my liking.3.) Very linear. The pseudo-free-roam that was present in the first game is gone too, everything narrows you down a linear path. Sure there are some ""choices"" that you make that effect some things, but that's pretty much it.In summary: fun gameplay, iffy style.			"

												First of all, I like the Darkness ll. It's a game that's linear and typical in terms of envrionment design, but oh so fun to play when it comes to story and gameplay.The Darkness is the ultimate weapon, you can use it to melee, grab, and literally tear apart enemies. I love the idea of relying on the dark to access the darkness abilities. You can upgrade your powers using points gathered through kills and finding collectibles. The weapons are awesome, quite a few to choose from and they all sound great and make a great addition to the darkness powers.There are several choices throughout the story as well. The character animations bring the characters to life and the enemies act like living breathing people rather than dull AI that just tries to kill you.The cell shaded graphics are something I'm not a fan of, but they still pull off a good looking game world.Only two things I don't like about The Darknesss ll:1.) The small scale levels.2.) Its short single player campaign.			"

												Darkness 2 is a first person shooter with fantastic story elements, environments, sound and voice acting. The story of Darkness 2 pulls you in very quickly. The cut scenes are in first person, so you feel like you’re right there in the middle of everything. I truly did want to progress in the game because of how involved I got with the plot. I will preface this review by saying I would VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING A XBOX 360 CONTROLLER More on that later… Let’s start with gameplay. Being able to control 2 guns and 2 deadly serpents attached at your shoulders at the same time makes for some killer combos and devastating enemy deaths. The game is very brutal with serpent deaths. Tearing off heads and ripping in half is just a taste. Being that the game is called Darkness, you need to stay in the shadows as the light will disable your serpents and make it difficult to see to fire on your enemies. This effect is truly disabling and you will not survive fighting in the light for long. You can collect various amounts of essence by killing enemies which you can trade in for various skills that will improve your character. There is a “skill reset” option so in case you find some skills are not good, you can reset everything for a small essence fee. Graphics and environments are stylized and really nicely done. It’s a split between comic book and real looking graphics. It fits right in with the story.Sound and voice acting are top notch. The Italian mob voices are fantastic and each character is unique. It was always a pleasure to hear dialogue back and forth between everyone. This game has a lot going on for in-game sound. It does get fairly noisy at times but that’s just an observation, not a complaint. Controls…they take getting used to. I tried this game using a mouse and keyboard but I found myself struggling. Switching to a 360 controller instantly corrected everything BUT the learning curve is still moderate. Stick with it and it’ll eventually become pretty natural. Stability and FPS are rock solid. Never crashed once on Windows 8.1 and got a solid 60fps throughout the game. Correct blurry view bugMany times during the game my view would become slightly blurry. Like the game forgot to reset back the focus. The simple fix when that happens was to take a screenshot. It fixed it instantly each time. It did get annoying as sometimes it would happen during intense battles and I’d have to take a second to reach the screenshot key. Pros+Graphics, environment, story, gameplay and sound are all very well done+Solid 60fps+Brutal enemy deaths+Solid variety of enemies+Slight replay value with new game ++Vendetta missionsCons+Controls take getting used to (use 360 controller)+Shouldn’t be so many unbreakable lights. +Some erratic graphical glitches throughout the game. But didn’t take away from anything+Combat can get somewhat boring+Darkling and Darkness tips can be repetitiveBottom line is that Darkness 2 is a good and seemingly underrated game. 7/10 Good			"

												Even though I think the amount of hours you can put into this game isn't that much. Maybe 20 hours max if you really got into the shooter. But the best thing about this game is the story.Honestly I kept playing only for the story, I haven't read the comics or played Darkness I so I had no idea what the concept was about. But this game's story is a very pleasing and interesting experience to have. You get two alternative ending, one makes sense and the other leaves me puzzled. And questions the protagonist's universe, still great story.Gameplay is good. Story is better.			"

												The game that has nothing to do with its original, other than key characters and world it's in. The story is bleak and obvious, gunplay is... okayish, but nothing to write home about. The music is dull and just here to fill the void. I can't call it a bad game, but can't say it's good either. The game's strongest point is that's it's tied to The Darkness in its story, not the game itself. Sad, really. I'm not fan of giving scores to games, but if for the sake of comparison, say, the original The Darkness was solid 10, then this game is closer to 6.			"

OSX SPECIFIC REVIEWI'd love to give The Darkness II a positive review, but as it stands, due to technological issues I can't.""The Darkness II"" lies on it store page, it lies because it tells you that it is also a OSX game, which isn't true. Currently (and probably for ever as support for the game has ceased) it is impossible to play on iMacs with certain technological aspects. Ranging from major graphical glitches to crashes, the whole game just doesn't work. Those issues cannot be fixed on OSX, as detailed on PCGamingWiki.Which means that it's basically unplayable. It. Doesn't. Work. Don't buy it if you're on an Apple Computer.EDIT: The OSX issues have still not been fixed. I played the game through on Windows completely now, and still can't really recommend it. The story isn't interesting nor satisfying, it's short (Singleplayer is 5 hours at best) and the gameplay isn't really worth it.			"

												TL;DR: If you're like me, one of the rare people who haven't tried the Darkness II until now, then the Darkness II probably won't be all that interesting for you. I wouldn't pay more than 20 dollars for this game.Pros:+Solid story/setting. There's a sort of yin/yang feel to the setting of the story due to the duality of some of major element in the setting.+Solid game mechanics. The ability to grab poles and fan blade to use as projectile to impale or slice enemy is probably one of the most satisfying way to kill enemy and quite honestly, if not for the much more rewarding glitch explots I'll mention later on, I would use projectile much more often because it's sooooo satisfying.+Graphics is solid. I've seen quite a few games that for one reason or another decides to make the scene dark or greyish but just end up being monotone. The Darkness II, while most scene is set dingy, dark, still have a few colorful scene to keep things interesting.Cons:+Character development, beyond the protagonist is mostly one dimensional. Even though I just finished the game right now I really can't remember much about most of the supporting character, that's how generic, uninteresting they are.+There are few flaws in the level design. Couple area where you can fall off a higher floor level, thus making you walk through the same area you passed through earlier to get back up. It's not fatal or game breaking, just annoying.+There are several invisible wall in this game, some post on forums mention a fix that I didn't try because I just hop around the wall furiously for a few seconds and got through all of them, but it's possible that some others may get stuck there as well.+Game breaking glitches. Be warned, I'm about to talk about an exploits that'll probably ruin at least 80% of the main story campaign for you. If you still plan on playing the main story campaign (and you're interested in more than the story), I suggest you skip the last part and try getting the game on sale or something.One of Jackie's Darkness power is to melee execute enemy and either gain health, ammo, power refresh, or a shield; the problem is that while you're going through the melee execution animation, you're actually invincible, once I realises that part way through the game, I can body shot any light enemy, melee execute to gain some health, rinse and repeast until you killed every enemy. And yes, the boss of this game is very kind in that they'll send minions in for you to kill to make sure that your health is always up. Therefore, it's actually kind of hard to die if you learn to use that to your advantages. "

												MAC USERS PLEASE READI'm going to start out by saying this is a good game, I've played it on console and its a lot of fun, but some graphics cards for macs can't render the textures in this game. Textures will dissapear and there will be a thick yellow mist covering the screen up, making it barely playable. DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF YOU OWN A MAC!!!!! The reason I am downvoting is because 2K vowed to fix this issue september 2015, and it still hasn't happened, if you want to play this game, buy a pc or look at the 2k customer service website to see what macs can handle it.

												The Darkness II is based off a comic book, and is supposedly to be a shooter with story. Unfortunately, I personally don't really like the story, which makes the bland gameplay even less tolerable. You may like it if you like the source material, but if you go in blind, you're not going to get much enjoyment out of this.			"

												UPDATED REVIEW:My biggest problem, is that there is not enough content in the game: the campaign is short, the coop missions are too easy and the coop campaign is too short.So I'd say it doesn't worth the money - if there is a discount maybe (but looking back I definitely wouldn't give more than 5 Euros for it).However, an interesting game, could have been a very good one. The base idea is interesting. Good gamespeed (in the short campaign you won't feel bored), average story, but it has a certain style (which is not for everyone). Maybe I would recommended for those, who like unique shooter games (FPS), and would like to have a really short game.The story: i won't make spoiler, it's not bad (i've seen much worse), but a little simple.The evolution of the skills are well-made, which is absolutely a good point.There are not so many guns, but that's not a problem, because at least, they are really not the same (i mean, there are real differences between two guns, not just the look of them).There are 3 major negatives:1. Graphic is bad. It is like a cartoon, but i think it wasn't a good choice.2. Story is very short. I walk through the campaign in 1 day.3. You are overpowered (mainly because of close combat - if you get close, you won). Even on highest difficulty, there aren't really difficult situations (maybe 1 or 2 during whole campaign). You can easily beat the coop missions alone.I would say, that it's an average game, good for a weekend, but not for more, so in conclusion I don't recommend it.If there will be a 3rd part, I would be interested in that, given that they change the graphic, and add much more story.

												This game was really nice to get during the 2K Humble Bundle, but similarly, only when it is under $5. I didn't go at this at the hardest difficulty, and timed a good five hours or so. If you're looking for a pretty decent story out of this, don't expect it. As for the story, the main character has PTSD from his girlfriend dying, only to realize that he might very well just be delusional as hell. See for yourself what truly happens. As far as gameplay go, it's really tedious. They throw the same kind of enemies around, some enemies just requiring more shots through the skull to finish up. Well worth the money though.			"

												I got to give this a 5/10 because I encountered a game breaking bug. It was fun up until that point too. Score might have been higher if I could finish it.And there are some spoilers here to tell you about the bug.About midway through the game when you get to the brothel and you are crawling through the vents there is at least 3 times where the vent changes, from a grill to normal vent for example. Each time it does this the change in vent type is slightly taller than the one youre standing on, so you collide with it, you can barely jump over the first two but the third one is impossible to pass, due to the fact youre in a vent and cant jump very high.So I never got to finish this game and I never will.

												I absolutely loved the first game, so I thought I would enjoy this one as well. I was sadly mistaken... They took away all of the fun powers and left in the worst. Furthermore, they said ""screw it"" to actually using your powers in interesting and fun ways. Now its just one mindless, repetitive gun battle, throughout the entirety of the game. I remember in the first game, being able to use your power that was like a snake, busting all the lights, stealthily eliminating the guards and actually having some tact. But not in this game. Bottom line, they removed all of the fun and we were left with another mindless FPS that left me highly disappointed.  The only things good that I can say about this game are as follows - 1 - The graphics are nice looking.2 - The storyline is pretty good. Though it still falls short of the first game.3 - . . . . I actually have no idea what to say here because the rest was awful. Buy it for $5 or less and only if you played the first game and want to see how the story unfolds. If you're new to the series, don't even bother with this. Play the first game as it's far more solid than this junk.			"

												Great ideas, even greater concept for a game and good story but absolute HORRIBLE and unplayable execution.The controls are extremely clunky to a level where you just want to throw your keyboard and mouse out of the window. The level design is so plain linear and dull beyond belief that it's almost an insult. And the first boss fight is probably the most mediocre and uninspired I have ever seen.Also, you don't even have the slightest feeling of controlling the oh so mighty Darkness.I was completely bored after one hour. I just finished DISHONORED a few hours before and got used to nice, working and smooth controls, but this game here is an horrible abomination. A mediocre shooter with awful controls. Good thing I only payed about 1 dollar for this failure via Humble Bundle.I really wanted to like this game. Really. It has such great ideas (The Darkness itself, dual wielding weapons, a demonic sidekick, blood and gore, executions, it's like a dream come true) and so much potential, but it all gets wasted. It's really a shame because I think this game could have done waaaay better.			"

												Stupid story so far, whiny 'hero'*, on-rails feeling, invisible walls galore, checkpoint system, clichéd characters and dialogues incl. cheesy voice acting, wannabe 'dark' atmosphere lives purely off clichés, grating sidekick darkling, some dead tart the hero's still stuck on but doesn't mean ♥♥♥♥ to me**, mouse doesn't feel right no matter what I do, sucky boss fights... well, I could think of more, but IMHO that's enough to convey how crappy this is.And of course the overused, clichéd voice FX for all things demonic. Can't stand hearing this anymore. But someday back in the 80s, Hollywood decided that's what demons sound like. And since this is one of the games that's desperate to be a movie, they throw every bad design decision at you that the desire to emulate a cinematic experience entails.Music: Both the wannabe-cinematic score and the licensed tracks suck so hard it almost makes me nostlagic... you know, back in the day when these ancient songs sucked so hard already?*'oh me, oh my, that darkness consumes me, eeeewwwoooh'. These 'powers' (weak-♥♥♥ as they turned out to be) are the only reason I was even interested. Hearing the 'hero' whinge and whine about them is grating and off-putting. Tacked-on, ham-fisted, moralistic mas tur bation.**No D1 on PC to play = no connection to D1 characters has been established, emotional or otherwise. I don't care for that cunnus at all. If it were possible to care negatively, I'd be at -100%. Yet, she's constantly thrust in my face and I have no choice but to constantly keep biting and swallow the mcguffin hook, line and sinker. Forced. Cheap. Irritating.'Cliché' isn't really a word I use all that often. Almost never. Yet it's a word I could use 100 times to describe this game, and I'd only just have scratched the surface. This game seems to be designed around antagonizing the player with every fiber it's composed of. Design, gameplay, storyline - all come together nicely to ♥♥♥♥ me right off. Thank god it was included in the HumbleBundle along with other stuff, so I can always pretend it was free. This is one of the rare games I wish I could get erased from my library. It's so bad, I can't just let it go and say 'meh, sucks'. It's gotten under my skin; it's very existance makes me angry.Graphics are okay, though, and gunplay is mediocre. Barely.			"

												1. Graphics2. Story3. Gameplay1. The graphics are very average. The graphics are of the same quality as Bioshock 1. Which would not be a problem if it was not 2014. 2. Story is kind of lame for my taste, none of this is believable or makes any sense.3. Gameplay could have been great, however, the Demon arms do not do as much damage as they should. Also, the cinematic action kills are very lack luster. "

												CONS1) Cell shading; is a plague on mankind. I understand The Darkness is based off a comic, I used to read it as a kid,  along with Witchblade. Albiet he looked ten times more badass in the comic, the cartoon filter over everthing does not make me feel like Im in the comic, it  makes me think like I'm slaughtering all the characters in toon town.  It takes away the sense of realism, and just makes all the over the top gore seem less visceral. The original game did not have quite as much gore, but it was ten times more real and satisfying without cell shading.  Maybe its ok to have in a game like Dragon Ball Z or Narruto because you're trying to make it look just like the show, but keep it out of FPS. Just because people like Borderlands doesn't mean it will work everytime. Personally I hate Borderlands, (but Im sure the game takes longer than 6 hours to beat). I suppose its also a way to avoid bad press if the game is way too violent and the cartoon look dampens the violence factor, but I dont think thats the case, and that imo is wimping out.2) Some abilities ruin the immersion of the game, there is one where anything you throw will explode on impact, and it doesnt really explode but it juts poofs into purple gas and completely disappears, including bodies, no bits, no metal shards, just purple gas.. and gone. Its not even a proper explosion and looks really cheaply done. I only got that ability to get the armor ability to see if it would look anything like how it did in the comic. the Darkness armor ability is pretty cool , but forcing you to have the stupid explode on impact perk is really annoying and not worth it. There are few other poorly thought out abilities , but that one is by far the worst.3) Guns are pretty generic, not many different models like they had in the first game. Instead they have abilities to power up guns with the darkness to make your bullets more powerful, thats all well and dandy, but I think they focused too much on those cartoonish abilities and not on actually giving you a good variety of weapons. Everytime you pick up a colt .45  its the same filigry inlayed 45 as the ones you start with. Like every goon in the game has Jackies signature custom .45's, like they are part of his fan club, its lazy. 4) The games too short, which is why if I spent more than $5 I would have felt ripped off.PROSas far as the PROS go there really arent that many other than its delightfully gorey, fluid enough gameplay and I only ran into one bug on the brothel level where you're in a vent, if you have a decent graphics card and have vsync turned off, you get stuck. Doesn't make any sense, but turn ON vsync for that part and you can pass, then turn that crap off. The story is pretty good but some of the characters get annoying like that guy in the beginning trailer of the game, I liked him at first but he gradually became more annoying as the game went on, his character was a little too overwhelming. I really liked seeing some old faces from the first game though, especially the Butcher. So in conclusion, I would recommend this game as long as you get it on a serious sale, and avoid some of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ abilities.			"

												Nah.To be fair, it had some pretty neat ideas here and there but they were only surface level deep. The story is very uninspired and predictable which may be the fault of the source material which I'm not familiar with because I ain't got nothin in life by readin and I aint about to start. The world seems very ""trying-to-be-gritty"" for lack of a better term. Yeah we get it Darkness II ripping out a man's heart = so edgy, you're a real game now. Maybe if the game didn't try to play it so straight and played the events with more levity I could have enjoyed the story more but I guess the source material doesn't allow for that. The gameplay is serviceable and even challenging a times but it really feels by the numbers, no clever enemy AI, no emergent game systems, bad fps boss battles, and very straightforward level design. So when there are areas that are challenging it comes off as cheap rather than a failure in learning the games systems. There's a few areas where the cell shaded art style really creates some cool looking environments but there are just as many uninspired ones. I get that it is trying to do an arcade shooter but frankly there are better examples of this, and with better storytelling too. See Call of Juarez: Gunslinger or the new Shadow Warrior reboot. Those are far better games to play.			"

												At first I was beginning to like the game, but then I got to a part in the game where I couldn't continue any further. Let me explain by what I mean. In the game the character that you play cannot be in light or else he won't be able to use the darkness powers. A way to combat the light is to shot the light and move on. Well during a level I came to a passage way that I couldn't cross because there was a caged light and I couldn't shoot it. The only way to turn off the light was to turn off the power and that was in another room. I had to get to the other room and to do that I had to climb through a vent using the secondary character with me. Once I got into the vents, I couldn't move any further through different spots in the vent. It just won't allow me to move any further. Really ticks me off.			"

												The game that has nothing to do with its original, other than key characters and world it's in. The story is bleak and obvious, gunplay is... okayish, but nothing to write home about. The music is dull and just here to fill the void. I can't call it a bad game, but can't say it's good either. The game's strongest point is that's it's tied to The Darkness in its story, not the game itself. Sad, really. I'm not fan of giving scores to games, but if for the sake of comparison, say, the original The Darkness was solid 10, then this game is closer to 6.			"

												It's one of the console games ported to pc that are worth playing.You won't be overwhelmed by the plot at first but hell.. You're the head of the Italian mafia , you're possesed by a ""demon"" and YOU control him. The sense of drama is fantastic and the twist in the story will make you more and more interested as you're progressing.It has tons of demon skills to aquire so you can kill your enemies but you can also do that by using guns and enviromental objects like a water pipe stabing to the head from range or use a car door to slice an enemy in half. Personaly i liked the boss battles too. It makes me happy to see a succesful mission and then go back to the safehouse and talk with Vinie about how you obliterated the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.Fun , fast gameplay and diversity.Just dont play the ""Vendettas"" It has half the magic of the campaign mode.10/10 would ask to get possesed again.

The tentacles on his back represent the choices we make in life. Whenever Jackie beheads, mames, and scars his italian foes, it shows us Jackie made the choice to give up on his life, and become one with his evil desires. This is similar to the shawshank redemption in that, Jackie is trying to claw his way out of his adopted mafia family ways, into the free world with Morgan Freeman. In The end, he is about to get his girlfriend back, and he frees her from the clutches of the darkness.

												I got this game in a humble bundle sale so I cannot properly tell you about price to fun ratio. but what I can tell you is that this game is..... okay. just okay. If i bought this for 30$ I Would have returned it after an hour. I tried to make it fun for myself by getting in to it but it was more than hard. ------PROS AND CONS------COMBAT= Is slightly above average for a First Person Shooter, It mixs standard shootem up gunplay (decent dual wield mixtures of guns) and a SOMEWHAT interesting monster tentacle hand to hand. GORE AND BLOOD= Although the combat isnt AMAZING it does have its ""moments"". Although the most ""memorable"" are the scripted SCENES(moments out of player control), that include extremely graphic, organs beings thrown out and apart, limbs getting pulled off like nothing, and intense moments of character punishment (like getting nails pounded into your limbs). STORY= Now sometimes a great story can save a games lesser aspects (although other parts are fairly decent), the story is.. well ""eh sorta interesting but easily forgotten"". Without spoiling to much, the story revolves around the whole ""I DON'T WANNA BE A TOTAL BAD♥♥♥♥♥SO I COMPLAIN ABOUT BEING A BADASS"", I understand what its going for but its not really working. It didnt really engage me to see it till the end at all, and its absolutely not a very long story. Even the Mafia esc teamates didnt really get me attached.________________________CONCLUSION-Unless you are really into gore and a somewhat interesting past story than this game is a waste of money.THE FINAL VERDICT IS 5/10 ALMOST COMPLETELY AVERAGE "

Posted: May 25, 2013
												Please note: I have never played Darkness 1 nor read the comic books that the series is based on, so this review is going to be written from that perspective.Darkness 2 is a sequel to Darkness 1 that was only released for Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 and the franchise is in turn based on the comic book of the same title produced by Top Cow Productions.It tells the story of a mob boss Jackie Estacado and his tormented life living with a dark god / demon known as ""The Darkness"" which basically grants him immortality but slowly draining his humanity.The main problem with Darkness 2 is that being a sequel, the player effectively loses alot of backstory about how Jackie came into being. Sure, there is an optional skippable prelude story narration that briefly summarizes his story, but it still feels rather empty because some of the later story elements (Such as Jenny) would have been more emotional and powerful if you have played the first game.Gameplay itself is fun, and although primarily a FPS, you are given 2 tentacles that lets you eviscerate enemies in the most gruesome manner possible. Because the tentacles are so powerful, i find myself using tentacles most of the time and neglecting to use guns.It also makes use of a light and dark mechanic where your character will be more powerful when in darkness, and the tentacles will not be available when there is light.So the general gameplay goes like this:1) Use guns to shoot out any light source2) Use tentacles to eviscerate and kill3) Repeat.Graphics has a unique graphic novel look similar to a toned down Borderlands look and while not too bad, has a very jagged and rough look and bad frame rates even when put on the highest settings on a decent above recommendation computer. I suppose its a result of being a direct console port.While the story is entertaining, it is rather short at about 7 hours. There also isn't much actual gameplay, and close to 70% of the time, you are either looking at cutscenes or scripted events.Just a little observation i've noticed.I also find it strange that every enemy would be so gung-ho to charge at you even after seeing what you've done.Example: If you were to see your friend getting ripped apart at the spinal cord by a guy with 2 evil looking dark tentacles, would you still try to attack him? I know i certainly wouldn't lol!! I know games aren't meant to be realistic, but still....There is also a multiplayer mode available. Unlike other similar games which offers this, somehow Darkness 2 multiplayer mode feels absolutely tacked on and unnecessary and is quite possibly the worst multiplayer mode ever made. There is absolutely no story, no thought gone into it and absolutely no entertainment to be gotten from it.I've tried the multiplayer campaign with 4 friends and none of us knew what the heck we had to do except to just shoot everything that is not us. I would've rate the multiplayer mode 2/10 if it were a standalone product. Absolutely disgraceful addition and they should've just dropped it to make a better single player experience.In closing, it is a pity that Darkness 1 was never released on the PC, as im sure the whole game series would've felt much better when played back to back.Overall Rating: 7.0 / 10Actually, just for the story alone, its worth 7/10. Gameplay wise, its 5/10. Buy this game if you enjoy a heavily scripted FPS with a decent single player story. Not worth full price, but not a bad deal if on a cheap sale.			"

												WARNING! MAJOR SPOILERS! DO NOT READ IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THE GAME YOURSELF! Still here? Okay, here we go!  This game was a total mindf*ck.  Throughout the story, you get these flashes of a mental hospital, and you're one of the patients.  All of the other characters in the game are either doctors or other patients in this hospital.  They tell you that the ""Darkness"" is just a dillusion, and they're trying to help you get better.  On the other side, in the gameplay you're told that this hospital is just a facade put up by the Darkness while it rebuilds your body after taking heavy damage.  The problem is, both sides of this can be equally correct, so you go through the whole game wondering which one is real.  At the climax, the game straight up asks you to choose a side.  And here we are, left with a great big Schrodinger's Cat situation.  You can play through both endings, and they both make sense in their context, but you're left wondering.  Did I defy the Darkness, chase it to hell, defeat it, and save my girl, or did I jump off a roof and kill myself, having one last delusion before hitting the ground?  Did I give up on my delusions and let the doctors help me live a normal life, or did I give in to the Darkness and let it keep me in a neverending dream?  Of course, the little post-credits bits left me with even more questions.  In the end, there is no absolute conclusion, and the player is left to sit there and debate over what they think is true.  This is one of the things that makes this game so amazing, and why I absolutely reccomend it to anyone.  "

												I played this back when it was first released on console then broke down and bought it for PC instead and traded my console version in. While the story is a continuation of the first game you don't really have to have played the first to get the gist of it as the game includes a tutorial level to help you along. That being said, The Darkness 2 picks up the story and the gameplay and makes it better, fresher and more exciting. Dark vs Light scenarios and your abilities definitely makes this game a blast to play. I thoroughly enjoyed it.			"

												Here is my review of The Darkness II1st off it is a amazing game with a strong storyline, even though the whole ""My girlfriend died I am in a bloodlust"" is kindasteriotypic, Digital Extremes pulled it off in a sorta action movie storyline. Today's date is 4/9/2015 and the game was released in 2/6/2012. Mabey I am a bit of an old school gamer but games that had care built into the product *cough* *cough* Call of Duty has no care *cough**cough* can make a really great game, granted the story is about 2-3 hours long the exprience feels like days and weeks of work. Buy it no matter if it is on sale or not, for $30 it is worth your money. Hell, I bought the $90 pack for close friends and they all greatly apperciate the game. No matter if you like FPS shooters or not I strongly reccomend the game.			"

												Ok, the game itself its quite good. It has an amazing story, especially for a more or less Mafia tale, the characters are all top notch, and all the lines are well preformed. The graphics look pretty good, with some bad textures from time to time, but its all cell shaded, which makes it look a lot like Borderlands. But that would only be if Borderlands was bloody. No joke, there was less gore in saving private Ryan. Limbs get torn off, people get impaled, and its all in this bloody mess. Which is good, by the way. Anyway, the gameplay is very arcade like shoot em up, with your demon arm to help impale people. Even on the lowest difficulty setting, its still a hard game, coming from a seasoned DkS2 vet,and well, ya. The only gripe I have with the gameplay is that ammo is semi-scare in early game, which well, just feels weird in an FPS.Overall, if you find the game on a sale, pick up up without hesitation. If you dont, well, here comes one of my only gripes. Single Player length. It will last only about 6 hours on Med. I get that its not that big of a deal, but well, for a game with not to much replay value...I mean, it does have a coop mode, but when I picked it up, the coop was dead.			"

												its a fun, gory, overpowered demon simulator. what more do you want. its fun to play and very creative, more in the animations of executions. it is however a fairly short game. on normal took me about 4 to 5 hours and when i went new game plus with all upgrades and mobster difficulty i blasted through in about 2 to 3 hours. they have slightly extended play time by adding a four player coop mod called vendetas which you play as either one of 4 steriotipical charectors and weild darkness items. you feel a lot less powerful in this mode and its less fluent. i recomend playing that mode first even just by your self becasue when you come to the main game you will feel a lot more powerful			"

												The combat is great, the story is good, and overall, this game is excellent.""The Darkness"" is an appropriate title. This game is dark, gory, and exciting. The combat flows well and makes you feel empowered purchasing various upgrades to further brutalize your enemies.At one point in the storyline I actually had to pause to collect my thoughts and make a decision. I really had to question everything I had seen so far.The biggest cons are a lackluster ending and a slightly short storyline. Worth buying without a doubt.			"

												Do not Buy. Game is unplayable.Game is known for its terrible CTD issues which have yet to be resolved.Some are related to Zone Alarm AV others Anti-Aliasing.I'm amongst those with a killer rig but cannot progress beyond first 2 levels no matter what.CTD or stuck at purple ring loading screen beyond start of Stage 2.Some have said the game cannot handle 2650 resolution so be warned.From what little I have played it is actually quite fun.UPDATEManaged to find a workaround for the game. If you encounter this common loading error, you can verify the game files in steam which will show 1 file needs to be reacquired.This will NOT fix the problem, however if you reacquire the missing file then go to steamapps and mark Darkness 2 folder as READ ONLY it fixed the problem for me.Was able to play through the entire game without issue, quit and take a break to come back also with no issues.The only remaining common issue seems to be with VSYNC. There are parts of the game where you play as a character that needs to move through tight spaces like a vent or under a boardwalk. VYSNC seems to cause issues where you get stuck and cannot progress in the game as its like having an invisible wall in front of you.Tinkering with VSYNC makes it work for some reason.			"

												Sequel to the most underrated game of 2007. The Darkness 2 starts 2 years after Jackie Estecado killed his uuncle Paulie and became mafia boss. But now he has to use the darkness again to defend himself from mysterious orgranization known as ""The Brotherhood"". Game delivers breathtaking strory of love and tragedy, amazing gameplay, and comic book style environment. You can litteraly decapitate,slice and dice, everysingle human being, apart from using different kinds of super powers like Swarm or Black hole. As you progress through story and kill a lot of enemies you earn Essence which you can use to buy different upgrades. Apart from main storyline there is also 4 player coop which tells the story from different perspective. All in all a great game to enjoy. Definately worth your time and money so go grab it, and embrace the Darkness.			"

												Darkness 2 is a twisted and dark FPS with  a lot of blood, guts and ripped bodyparts. The story is dark too and tells us a story of a mafia boss struggling with his inner ""darkness"" which is trying to break free. I haven't read the comics or played the first one but didn't feel I missed anything. Mechanic-vise you got weapons to shoot through iron sight and two tentacle demon arms to smash enemies to pieces, grabbing and throwing stuff etc. I was surprised how nice it felt to use all the powers and to cause mayhem. Both shooting and the arms feel complementing each other and useful  together. Darkness 2 isn't a long game but since it's simply running through corridors killing enemies it started to get a bit stale towards the end... and then the game ended. There is newgame+ and some smaller campaigns but I didn't try those and neither I will. I'm happy what I got with the main game and will move towards a next game.			"

												This game is fantastic, really fun gameplay mechanics and really good story. I'm really curious to see what the media said about this game when it was first released, there are alot of religious factors in this game that take place and it often twists some religion stories, mostly Christian, so if your a religious nut which I highly doubt then I wouldn't reccomend this at all but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥some of the stuff they twist is interesting and makes for a better story, sadly you gotta collect it and nobody has time for that, besides for me but anyway its a great game, great story, and great religious twisting? I guess? I don't know buy it already why are you still reading this♥♥♥♥♥♥why are you even looking at this review the game was made in 2012 this is 2016 for god sake! I'mma go google what the media said about this game now.			"

												This is a rail-shooter/FPS based on a Top Cow comic book series, in case you didn't already know.Follow Jackie Estocato, a New York mafioso who has risen through the ranks in the previous game, to be the boss he is now.Oh and he is demonically posessed, and on a quest into his own personal, and literal hell, for the soul of his girlfriend. Controller is probably the best way to play it, since remapping the keyboard isn't an option that's available for some keys, at least it wasn't for me, as I had broken those keys.It was a fun romp for the 6-8 hours you get out of it, and some ideas there in the later chapters give you some other ideas about Jackie, and leaves you wondering.7/10 - I personally didn't connect with Jackie, but that didn't stop me from having fun with this shoot-em-up. Would be nice if it were longer, or the multiplayer were better or just not included so that the main game could have that energy spent on it. And then there's the controversy over the field of view. I had to take off another point just for that.			"

												Sequel to the most underrated game of 2007. The Darkness 2 starts 2 years after Jackie Estecado killed his uuncle Paulie and became mafia boss. But now he has to use the darkness again to defend himself from mysterious orgranization known as ""The Brotherhood"". Game delivers breathtaking strory of love and tragedy, amazing gameplay, and comic book style environment. You can litteraly decapitate,slice and dice, everysingle human being, apart from using different kinds of super powers like Swarm or Black hole. As you progress through story and kill a lot of enemies you earn Essence which you can use to buy different upgrades. Apart from main storyline there is also 4 player coop which tells the story from different perspective. All in all a great game to enjoy. Definately worth your time and money so go grab it, and embrace the Darkness.			"

												Damn fun game, from the first mission right to the last. ~7 hrs total gameplay, with many more hours of bonus stuff for achievement hunters. The story is dark, twisted, and had me guessing all the way through. The action is just the right combination of gruesome and hilarious. Not for the faint of heart. Thumbs up for good ol’ fashion arcade-style first person shooter with decent voice acting, interesting plot, and playability that will stand the test of time (released back in Feb 2012). There are a few petitions for Darkness 3 floating around, and they can have my signature.			"

As opposed to the more popular now games where it involves lots of hiding behind things, waiting for the right moment and blah blah blah. This keeps my attention unlike the others.			"

												Well this is disappointing, I had The Darkness II in my library since 2014 and thought it would be an amazing game. Oh boy, how wrong I was...Pro:+ Beautiful comic book art style. Of of the best besides Borderlands and The Wolf Among Us.+ Some levels look really good thanks to the art direction.+ A dual wielding system where you can mostly mix and match, meaning you can carry a Desert Eagle in one hand and an UMP 45 in the other one. Or two UMP's in both, two Desert Eagle's in both, etc. This is very welcoming since this is rarely seen in FPS games.+ Quite decent voice acting.+ The Vendettas (COOP levels) are quote fun, much more fun than the SP campaign even.Cons:- The story is worse than average, you won't find anything new or exciting here.- It took me only 6 hours to complete the main story. There's some extra stuff and a new game option, but it's nothing but unnecessary padding. To think that this game costs $30 is appalling.-  I mentioned ""extra stuff"", it's a tagged on COOP campaign. They're selling a Four Pack for $90 on this very Store Page and you'll be able to get 2 or 3 hours of gameplay with your friends, now if this isn't value for your money, right? /s- The gameplay feels just like your basic CoD clone. Hitmarkers? = ✓ Huge crosshair that forces you to use ADS? = ✓ Heavily scripted gameplay? = ✓ Cutscenes every few minutes? = ✓ 3 Weapon carry limit? = ✓ Regen health? = ✓ Jumping is useless because of invisible barriers? - ✓ Useless AI? = ✓ - The soundtrack is extremely boring, it's your typical Hollywood music that's supposed to sound ""epic"".- The darkness powers are meh at best, you can slice enemies in half or behead them, though you'll be seeing the same exact animation every time. I haven't counted them but there don't seem to be more than 4 or 5 different kill animations.- The game is almost entirely composed of corridors. I wasn't kidding when I compared this to CoD, hell, the few CoD games I played actually had more open areas than this game.- I've mentioned this before, the AI is beyond awful. Enemies will take cover right next to you. Enemies will yell ""Don't get too close to him"", while running towards you or standing right next to you. Some levels have  friendly NPC's to back yo up, but they don't actually do anything when an enemy gets close to them. The enemy will also fully ignore your pals, they're only fixated on you.- Talking about enemies, the entire game uses them same enemy models over and over again, just with a slightly different skin.- The enemies are extremely annoying to the point of madness. There are enemies who will blind you so that you can't see anything whatsoever for a few seconds, your darkness powers won't work then either, enemies who have huge shields to protect themselves, they'll shoot you from a distance and when they get close they'll knock you back a large distance, enemies who can literally throw a magical lasso at you that will steal the weapons your currently carrying, then there's the teleporting enemies which teleport themselves all over the map. All of these enemies are also huge bullet-sponges and you'll run out of ammo all the time because the game tries to force you to use your darkness powers.- The boss battles are like this: Huge bullet-sponges that can usually teleport and send waves of enemies at you.- Talking about waves of enemies, a lot of the SP campaign consist of you being locked in an arena type of level while enemies swarm all around you. You have to kill wave after wave and then the game allows you to move on. Rinse and repeat.- The graphics look better on the Store Page than they do in the game. I hate to be so negative about a game, especially a game with such a beautiful art style, but that's just the way it is.			"

												Actually, the game is quite ok, but cannot say much more. It is simply ok, 6/10 at best. As for me, the story is completely idiotic with primitive cliches. Main hero makes stupid choices, and when during cutscenes you do not want to follow the line, you simply cannot. Don't be mistaken: the game is linear in story and levels. It would be boring in gameplay, but in fact, game is quite short and locations are even somehow different.Combat system is, well, not really impresive. Enemies are unbabalanced, some of them capable of withstanding dozen of headshots from assault rifle. Our hero is afraid of light, but the problem is that you cannot even find the source of the light sometimes. Also, some of the lightes are protected by anti-vandalism cages. Bulletproof, of course. It feels like FPS made for consoles, and it feels greatly. How? Autoaim, enemies cover letting their head open and during special attacks, which can be made all the time, player is immortal (for several seconds). WTF.It is definitely overpriced for maximum 8 hours of gameplay. Remember, no multiplayer, no different endings, no real choices. Good old Doom 3 looks like an open world game with deep story in comparison to this. "

												More of a twitch-based fast-paced shooter than I would like to play.  Enemies will attack from side and back and you cannot see them.  Then you die from a cheap kill. Respawn.  Rinse. Repeat.   The shooting is more like Serious Sam than it is Far Cry 1, as a point of reference.  You get abilities which are cool but you will need to access them quickly at all times while shooting to make use of them, or you die.  On top of that you only have all of your abilities if you are standing in darkness.  Some will love this lightening speed pacing but if you dont, you wont love this game.			"

												Unfortunately, I played through #1 on Xbox, and I was a huge fan of the creativity, and solidness of the game. This game on steam, broke that fandom. Level one, I shot a guy, he went through the wall, to the point of just his legs stuck out (shaking violently). I thought this was somewhat funny.A few more similar events later, I found myself in a strip-club setting. I had made it upstairs in the level, to a point where you take control of the little British goblin to go through air ducts. I made it roughly half-way through the duct before the character got stuck. There are points in the duct where two duct pieces come together. It required me to jump up and down violently, moving back and forth for a good 2-3 minutes before I dislodged myself and moved further into the duct. Where I ran into another wall, This one impossible to pass. I reloaded my game thinking it was just an glitch that might be solved. I made it past the first glitch after some work again. I still could not get past the second. If I we're able to make it past an hour and a half into the game, I might review it better. Since I can't, I won't.			"

												Overall, The Darkness 2 is a good game, but it has a variety of frustrating details that make the game much less fun, and generall my willingness to pay attention to the story.1. Controls - There are several boss fights as well as a bunch of ordinary encounters that require you to quickly move out of the way or dodge something. The problem is that you move like a pregnant boat. This isn't really that much worse than a lot of first person shooter games, but those games don't want you to dodge.2. Nonsense - You can run through the game getting blasted by shotguns and machine guns and survive. I don't have a problem with this. After all, in the context of the story you should be able to. The problem is that whenever the story wants you for some reason a quick flash or lights or a shotgun blast put you on the ground unable to move.3. Lights - I really do like the mechanic that you can't use any of your powers in the light--that is the way that it is in the comic after all--but that game randomly desides that some lights can't be destroyed. So, you spend a great deal of the game destroying one light after another only to be held up in the level by a light with a metal grate over it. Annoying.4. Story - The story deviates significantly from the comic, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. There are however two main problems with how the story is told in this game. First, there are a greate deal of boring dialogue that you have to pay attention to, to have any understanding of what is happening in the story. This becomes grating. Second, the story relys very heavily on common tropes. Vengence for the murder of your girlfriend. Vengence for *spoiler*'s murder. A dark broodin man of violence, fighting his inner demons. It's been done.			"

												I think my opinion is completely biased, since I got this game on a Humble Bundle and played it just to clean my backlog, but this game is absolute garbage.First of all, it took me 4 hours to finish it on the highest difficulty. Four hours. Yeah.Besides that, gameplay is♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemies are copy-pasted, the AI is mentally challenged, environments are nothing to behold, graphics are that same cartoonish crap the you see in Borderlands. And the story. Oh man, the story. I've never seen something so bad, and I've played a few Call of Duties and Assassin's Creeds in my life. Even if I tried to remember one good thing to say about this game, I couldn't. Terrible from start to finish, don't buy it.Gameplay - 2/10Soundtrack - 1/10Graphics - 2/10Content - 0/10Challenge Level - 5/10Replayability - 1/10			"

												Eeeeeeh. I really wanted to play this game for a while now, finally at 6.00$ I grabbed it. Super not impressed. They keep dragging this really cliche and poorly done storyline across your face and all you really wanna do is ♥♥♥♥ people up with your monster powers. It's kind of like having a storyline in DOOM, the game is all about shooting up monsters, not what the UAC is doing on Mars... But besides the annoying storyline that's constantly shoved at you, the gameplay really is pretty lackluster. You can't really do all that much with your demon arms, and on top of that, it's actually more effective to grab headshots on the bad guys than it is to attack them with previously mentioned demon arms. So far this has played like a Call of Duty campaign for me and it's been pretty lame. It's not a bad game but considering you can buy a freaking great game like DOOM, Witcher, GTAV, or any of the other great titles on sale right now, I wouldn't bother wasting 6 dollars US on this game.

												Not a fan of mass trends which actually made me buy this title but they exist for a reason (lesson learned ? )and the reason why most players avoid this ""insert useless terms "" game is pretty obvious.  2k games is the only thing which made me even consider , greatly disappointed. Pretty much waste of time , money , bandwidth and whatever other resources you consider worth... The story line describes a pshycotic person having delusion of himself as crime lord possesed by evil thingy or the other way around ... players choice to believe whichever . Personaly i like the irrational stuff but this was pretty lame.Graphics are  saturated , overly pixelated , extensively antialiased ( the ironic big borders really ) eye candy , the pretty standard yadayda for AA title , which are pretty good tbh in some parts . But thats about the best this game has to deliver.Extensive use of gore , crappy and rhetorical weapons ( just like this review ) , the mindless shooting and maiming (the irony)  extremely short story ...wait  was that even a story ? Not even sure why this game supports coop play . I can go on and ""insert wall of text here "" but i think you got the point by now.Sigh the regrets of steam sale buyouts...			"

												A smorgasbord of sex, violence, and swearing, trying to have an appearance of maturity...Technically speaking, its got everything right to make a good game:1. Good graphics.2. Good physics.3. Good voice and animated acting (the mental-patient who thinks he's adolf Hitler comes to mind.)But seriously, games (and movies and TV shows) that takes the road of sex, violence, and swearing to appear mature are getting really really old. Violence: you get to rip your enemies in so many ways - vertical, horizontal, pull their spines and skulls out through their♥♥♥♥♥ Geez. Tone it down several notches and instead give its atmosphere (and the music) a boost. Ever heard of Alan Wake? There's Darkness there too and man did I feel that one.Sex: There are scenes of oral sex, sex from behind, moaning ala porn stars, and beating up women in the sexual context. References of snorting drugs from private parts of women I mean seriously.Music: Eh, so-so. Its ok. Does the job.Storyline: Pffft. Like, yeah right. Basically, the premise is - Light and Darkness are entities in an eternal battle. Great concept. Execution tries too much to be ""cool"". Too much in fact that it is the ""thing"" that makes it feel ""immature"" in its attempt to be ""mature."" If Light (The Angelus) is the opposite of The Darkness, then that means its as good as The Darkness is evil. Why then does it look like a cosplay hooker?Gameplay: The gun-combat is pretty ok by today's standards. Dual-wielding pistols and tactical assault pistols/rifles is awesome. Don't expect to dual-wield high-caliber weapons here though. You're a mob boss, not a mech.Atmosphere. The feeling of being too much indoors, even if you are outside, is too much in my opinion. Did I ""feel"" the darkness? I felt it when I played Alan Wake. Here, not at all. Even with the voice of The Darkness eerily speaking through my 7.1 surround gaming headset. Would The Darkness like some losenges? ^_^.I'm glad its a short game.Yeah, just when you thought that you cannot be desensitized any further...you know what I mean?CONCLUSION: Take away the sex, violence, and cussing, and this game is ziltch.

												Kill moves become a little too repetitive, storyline not anywhere near as good as the first, here's hoping they ditch the idea of a trilogy. If you have 6 hours to kill and this is the only thing between you and boredom... and you've finished mirrors edge 3 times.. and the walls in your house have all dried.. its plausible that this is worth it during a 75% off sale.*Spoilers*If your looking for a game like the first one.. go get a bunch of gangsters to hammer in your head till you forget anything about the first one and replay that because the concept of hell in this game is unimaginative and come across more like ""Dante's cousin Jeff's playground of slate next to the doctors"" rather than the war torn never ending torture of ""Dante's Inferno"" the first showed us. Emotional connections in the game cease to inpsire and while torture scenes of the first evoke feelings of empathy and terror as you fight your way out, the recent equivalent is a long dialog with a crap single button quicktime event.In summary, if this was a free DLC to finish off the last part of the first game.. i wouldn't download it because it would have completely ruined the imagination that was poured into the first.

												At the current price (30USD/EUR) I can not recommend the game. The good parts are too short. It only takes around 6 hours to complete and the mechanics do not work well in the first half: - weapon focus takes up half the screen - huge difficulty gap between normal enemies and shielded ones - headshots seem almost randon (when actually aiming at the head) - execution animations are too long and become boringIt just feels clunky overall. Even simple things like the default bindings: number 1 key selects gun on the right of the GUI, numer 2 selects the left, and 3 the middle one.In the second half things get better, you get more difficult opponents and the gap is smaller, bosses require some tactic, abilities become useful as you upgrade them, and I got used to some of the clukyness. But just as things get better, the game is over.Graphics and story are great, but it felt unsatisfying overall.			"

												Digital Extreme's follow-up to the clunky but inspired The Darkness improves the core gameplay that let Starbreeze's game down but that's all it does. It's surprising how little actually happens in The Darkness 2, and how many of the emotional beats from the first game it recycles. It's visceral fun in the moment but beneath the gore and the flashy gunplay there's linear 5 hour shooter sporting with none of the scope or variety of the original game and a bare-bones multiplayer mode. Then again, its brevity may be a good thing. Any longer and you'd probably notice how few tricks The Darkness 2 has up its sleeve.			"

												(Note: I didn't play the first The Darkness game nor do I have experience with The Darkness comic books)At its best The Darkness II is a very stylish game. The comic book origins of this title really come out in a positive way in that regard. Sadly the gameplay does not live up to the presentation aspect of this title.At the very best you can call The Darkness II an above average shooter. It does nothing special which might sound weird considering how you basically are a semi-god demon monster with tentacles coming out of you ready to rip enemies and the envinroment alike apart. It's just very basic under the shiny shell. You're not really encouraged to utilize your demonic skills and when you do it just doesn't feel very cool. Naturally darkness is weak to light which brings us to a very frustrating gameplay mechanic. Remember how everyone loves getting hit by flashbangs in shooters? Me neither. The Darkness II manages to take this to another level. Light makes you incapable of using your demon skills which in practice means whatever plan you had with impaling an enemy with that spear-like object you can forget. The real pain starts when enemies start using light against you. This results in many chaotic moments where you just have no idea where to shoot to regain some level of control over the game. The blinding effect of light is way overdone and will make you feel frustrated. When you being the badass mob leader demon you are have to stop every time coming to a new area to snipe off lightbulbs with your pistol you know something is not done right. To top this off the game has a bug which frequently makes motion blur ""reverse"". What this means is that everytime the motion blur should be off it's on and vice versa. It's not enough to destroy the experience but it's annoying.The story is The Darkness II's best part. It's not magnificient but it will keep you interested. Characters are solid with a few really standing out. That said I felt very unsatisfied with the ending. As a stand-alone product it doesn't really work. After about 7 hours of singleplayer campaign you don't have much to do. You can hunt down relics (with some really interesting descriptions as a reward I have to say!) or try a harder difficulty level. The game also features the ""mandatory online element"" where four of your friends take on separate missions from main story. With no real story I had absolutely no motivation in trying my hands at those the gameplay being mediocre. If you want a multiplayer co-op shooter I'm sure you can think of better ways of spending your time and money.After all the complaining you might think I hate the game but this is not the case at all. Beyond the presentation it's just not anything special. Mediocrity is not a crime and I'd say The Darkness is definitely worth it if you can find a great deal. At anywhere close to the full price I wouldn't consider it.			"

												The Darkness II is emblematic of so many of the worst narrative and design concepts of gaming as a medium.It’s a game so obsessed with its own mythos, so completely devoid of self-awareness, and so appallingly misogynistic that it is often actively painful to witness. The entirety of The Darkness II seems designed around alliterative bullet points: “guns, girls, and gore.” In many ways then this isn’t terribly different from so many shooters, but where The Darkness II sets itself apart is in how much it revels in its own stupidity and filth.It’s going to be important later on in this review, so just so we’re all caught up let’s quickly run through the basic premise behind The Darkness II: brooding protagonist has nothing to live for; girlfriend gives him purpose; girlfriend is killed to get back at protagonist; protagonist has nothing to live for and decides to kill everyone. Somewhere in there is also the fact that our protagonist, mafia kingpin Jackie Estacado, has a demon (the eponymous Darkness) living inside him which gives him superpowers and mostly makes him invincible. From here on events unfold as they typically do, with the introduction of a cult hell-bent on taking Jackie’s darkness (because that’s what cults do) causing all sorts of chaos, as Jackie all the while holds up inside his head lamenting the loss of his girlfriend and showing emotions™.Though its stereotypical setup might lead you to believe otherwise, The Darkness II’s biggest problem isn’t in its rudimentary plot (though that’s definitely one of them) but in how its only means of creating conflict and motivation for its characters is through violence toward women. Jackie’s girlfriend, Jenny, is fridged before the prologue is finished (a carryover from the last game) and from that point on The Darkness II kills literally every single female character in the game for the sake of motivating Jackie, all while neglecting to give them even the smallest bit of personality, as ultimately their only reason for inclusion (beyond to be fridged) is to be objectified and tortured.What’s possibly even worse than the way The Darkness II treats women is in how it attempts to mask its misogyny under faux-emotional maturity and narrative sophistication. Developer Digital Extremes dedicates a not-insignificant amount of time to attempting to humanize the relationship between Jackie and Jenny, but because Jenny exists merely as a narrative prop with all the personality of a perverted body pillow these segments feel like little more than gross reminders of how one sided and shallow their relationship actually is. It doesn’t help that Jackie is something beyond unlikable with a penchant for juvenile philosophy, as he sits in the dark gun in hand and recites odes to his own amorality. The Darkness II was never a game with a penchant for subtlety, but its writing is so horrendous and convenient that it can’t even scrape by as merely clichéd, but instead doubles down on its tropes, on its misogyny, on its pornographic love of meaningless violence, and then tries to sell it to you as mature storytelling.Some might say this is just staying true to The Darkness’ comic book roots, but justifying The Darkness II’s narrative disaster through its mirroring of another work does little but damn them both. And to that point there is little about The Darkness II that speaks to its awareness of the tropes it’s employing, as it is so abundantly self-serious that it is impossible to enjoy it as knowingly dumb or comically grotesque the way one might enjoy a B-movie. In the few cases where The Darkness II tries to introduce some levity to its proceedings it predictably punches down, with sexist and ableist jabs that are neither clever nor shocking, but just as cheap and untasteful as the rest of the game.And low and behold if this isn’t as exceedingly routine a shooter as its narrative deserves. The Darkness II’s main mechanical hook is using your two demon arms in conjunction with more ordinary guns to create a sort of synergistic ultraviolence, but in application your demonic appendages are little more than glorified swords and grappling hooks. There was a lot of room for The Darkness II to create interesting encounters focused around forcing you to think creatively with the one thing that sets this apart from any other shooter, but The Darkness II is wholly and unapologetically married to its power fantasy mundanity, and so you are left with room after room of decidedly uninteresting grunts to tear your way through as if the thrill of watching your demon arms rip a man in half is enough to make combat interesting.The Darkness II’s demon arms reminded me a lot of Bioshock’s plasmids, but where Bioshock used its plasmids to setup interesting dynamics between you and your enemies, The Darkness II is focused on nothing but accommodating as aggressive a playing style as possible. And that’s not inherently bad, but there is nothing about how The Darkness II plays that makes that aggression satisfying. The shooting is loose, your arms are overpowered, the enemies are tedious and ordinary, and you’re constantly being funneled down the tightest of corridors. The Darkness II tries to counteract this by implementing a kill based scoring system reminiscent of Bulletstorm, but it lacks the depth and creativity that made kills in that game so entertaining, settling here for a narrow range of possibilities which mostly serve to distinguish between gun and darkness kills.The Darkness II’s mechanics would feel like a missed opportunity if the entirety of the framework surrounding them wasn’t so unsalvageable. The Darkness II is a game reeking of the worst sorts of narrative based sexism, marrying its violent tendencies with misogynistic conveniences, and the sort of discriminating carelessness that video games so often try to pass off as a sign of their maturity. To the contrary The Darkness II is one of the least innovative and sophisticated games I have played in a very long time, seeming to exist for the very sake of regressing videogames back to a time when nobody questioned why every female character has enormous breasts or why they are constantly getting kidnapped.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

It's got a decently interesting art style, the voice acting is better than average, it's got an in-depth ish skill system, and mechanically the game is sound.  It just isn't that fun.  After clearing out the tenth room of brain damaged minions, you develop a routine: take out the lights (by the way, for a game called ""The Darkness"", the game is never that dark) and then reuse the same couple of tired kill animations to finish everyone off.  This game managed to make having demonic superpowers boring.			"

Gunplay is decent, but gun swapping is kind of odd. It's easy to accidentially swap weapons while you're running around doing darkness executions. The story was also pretty bland.

												OK, why was I so disappointed with this game? Three main points spoiled this game for me. I won't go on about graphics, they're fine. Decent engine, decent artists etc. Game mechanics were fine. The menu system was a little annoying but you get used to that. Music was typically horrible but thankfully you can turn it off unlike some games(yes Halo 4, I'm talking about you) So what didn't I like? Read on.Firstly, cinematics...lots and lots of cinematics. The annoying kind where you can't move and the characters talk seemingly forever when all they have to do is say, 'go out the door and shoot everyone you see.'. You can hardly travel 100 meters without being dragged into some scripted action sequence or some long boring dialogue. Judging by the amount of positive reviews this game receives I assume most people don't mind this. I don't understand. I find it very tedious. Don't get me wrong, I like storylines. I'm happy to sit and watch little cinematics every now and then. I just hate the game being interrupted every 5 minutes just so someone can tell you to walk down some stairs or whatever. OK, finished gripe no.1Second gripe; the demon, serpent, tentacle,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥things. I assumed they were something you could bring up to use when you needed them. Nope, they're there the whole time. Fine if you like that sort of thing, IE great big dangly appendages cluttering up the screen, and I understand that some people do like that sort of thing, just not me. Oh, and apart from their basic intrusiveness, they're just silly. A gangster with tentacles, spare me please.Thirdly, the sidekick. Again, some people obviously like annoying little halfwit sidekicks running around saying annoying half witted things. I just happen to not. The last half hour of my abortive attempt at playing this game was spent shooting it. The only joy I had in this game was discovering that you can shoot the sidekick, though regrettably he does regenerate.So there you have it. I wanted to like this game. I loved Sandman and Hellblazer and other stuff back in the day. I knew it would be silly. It's graphic novel/comic book type horror, of course it's going to be silly. Unfortunately excessive cinematics, non-retractable tentacles and a sidekick modelled on a brain damaged teenage metal head made this game unplayable for me. Sorry Digital Extremes. I tried.			"

												Severely dissapointed with this game, although I may be a tad biased.First of all, the second installment of The Darkness is nothing like it's predecessor; save the generous heaps of blood and gore and the bone-chilling voice of The Darkness itself. It's style has been completely revamped, sporting a much more ""cartoony"" look that resembles the comics well. However, this style change is not just skin-deep. See, the original Darkness game was unique in the sense that it actually managed to be better than it's originial content: the comics. It ditched the more ham-fisted aspects of the story that were introduced far too quickly (conveniently evil cults, an overly obvious antithesis of the Darkness, and many more things that made it far more ""fantasy"" than anything else. The first game changed all of this. The story was far more dark and grounded in reality, and you truly felt as though you were the the most powerful person in the world because half of the time, you were fighting low-life thugs and corrupt cops.  Enemies cowered in fear when you unleashed your demons because they had never seen anything like it. This time around, you are fighting a great deal of enemies who seem to be more aware of what's going on than you do (just less powerful), and that takes away a great deal of the thrill. Fighting terrified mobsters was easily my favorite part of The Darkness 2, but as soon as the evil cult shows up with all of their mystical weapons and hardware, I lost interest. I was just in another comic-inspired game. This change of style also poses continuity problems because altough the tone of the game has changed COMPLETELY, references to the first game are made constantly. This tethers you to a universe that looks and feels completely different, and the story experience thus feels less cohesive. It's a sequel, but it's not. It is it's own game, but it's not. (this is ofcourse assuming that you played the first game).The gameplay is where the fun begins and eventually commits suicide. The gunplay is tight and responsive; you can use your demon arms to cut apart enemies (sometimes clean in half); and you can even tear doors off of cars and use them as a shield, whipping it at unsuspecting enemies when you're bored. You can even pick up construction poles and pin enemies to walls with them. To make this even BETTER, you can actually do most of this in a matter of seconds if not all at once.  Sounds fun, right? Absolutely. So where does it all fall apart?It falls apart when the game introduces a scoring and execution system.Remember Bulletstorm? In case you didn't, Bulletstorm introduced the concept of rewarding players for finding creative ways of killing enemies. This ranged from pulling off headshots to literally kicking them into environmental hazards riddled throughout the area. The Darkness 2 mimics this minus the environments............kinda lame.......Either way, straight up shooting enemies to death (even if you pull off a headshot) doesn't reward you with NEARLY as many points as performing an execution does. As a matter of fact, executions are easily the best way to get points. On top of this, you are rewarded even further depending on which of the three TYPES of executions you performed. These can reward you with extra health, ammo, or a darkness shield. This essentially translates to: if the game gets too tough; shoot some guy in the nuts, perform a health execution (that you can't be hurt during), rinse and repeat. But I honestly think the extra points from executions is the worst offender. I loved experimenting with all of the potential options for carnage that I had access to, but I innevitably found that the point system pressured me into a playstyle that prioritized points over fun. The COOP? It's a tacked-on piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥maranated in stale beer and the tears of young orphans.Really. Thats all I have to say about the coop.Bottom Line: You a goreaholic and need to see some people torn apart by demonic powers? Wait till this game goes on sale, and I assure you that it will not dissapoint in that regard. However, if you are looking for an experience that rivals that of the first game, you may find yourself as dissapointed as me.			"

												I've played through the first couple of missions and honestly I'm not impressed.  A lot of time is spent with ""talking"" (cutscenes, mission briefings, etc) and I really can't bring myself to care... The story seems shallow, I haven't been made to give a rats♥♥♥♥♥about the main character or anything he's going through.So cut out the story and what do you have?  A shmup more-or-less like any other except you've now got super powers.  Might be cool for some, but personally I don't care to have four different ""fire"" keys plus mouse gestures to control my demon tentacles.  It's too much for this old guy to keep track of.And seriously... What the hell is up with The Darkness' voice?  He sounds like he could be Gollum's brother.Debating whether I want to press on or simply delete.  I'm leaning towards delete.  Thank god I got this on the cheap as part of a Humble Bundle.			"

												Before I start I just want to say that the combat system in this game is quite fun.Now that I said that let's begin. First off the FOV slider doesn't go high enough for me but I like to play on a FOV of 90 or higher so that is most likely not going to affect you. Secondly the amount of dialogue vs combat feels like 50/50 due to it being quite lengthy and often unskippable when it is not a cutscene. Thirdly one of the mechanics in the game is that bright areas remove your supernatural powers. This would be an interesting mechanic except it makes the game often annoying due to you being in the middle of a firefight and then lose your tentacles so you have to look up and take out the light while being shot. Also there are lights which you can only take out when you follow the wiring to a generator which is annoying as you often have to pass through the light to get to it.These problems I could handle and are only minor mistkes but it was when I reached the vent crawling part of the game which I stopped. What happened was there was some glitch where you could not fit through unless you jumped at a specific angle. After about five minutes of this I stopped out of frustration.Of course I advise you to also read other peoples reviews so that you can get a better view of this game to see if it is for you.			"

												Very disappointed in this purchase, I bought this game because of how well it was rated but I am deeply dissatisfied with the final product. My first time playing this game, so I thought I would play with a friend due to us both just installing it, and therefore we thought we would give it a try. When placed in the game, I noticed a weird tint and blur to the screen which made it impossible to play. I tested out a few troubleshoot ideas and carried on playing the game, but it seemed to just get gradually poorer until all that was visible was the sky and player names.PSH.Rating - 0/10 (Unplayable)			"

												One of the worst high-rated game I've ever seen. A linear, scripted game. You're not given any choice what so ever, the combat is trash. Same mobs repeated 10294321 times and the blurry screen... Oh my god the blurry screen. It hurts my eyes fighting with that unfocused camera for hours. Managed to figure out changing the aspect ratio fixes it, for only a minute or two.The story is acceptable, the concept of the game was there. It's a horrible PC port, got a gaming controller but even with it the controls were god awful. This game has hidden collectibles and while playing through this linear crap game killing the same enemies since the start of the game i really couldn't give a crap about the collectibles.The shadow executions, there are four categories and three scenes each category. Discerning weapons from hearts is done in a way that any horrible than it already is must be impossible. Every minute i played this i wanted it to end. But i gotto get my money's worth. I paid for torture.Your shadow powers, you only got two attacks with one add. One is slashing, horizontally or vertically. The second attack is grab. The add is that you can execute once you grab your victims or throw them including objects. Thats it. Two attacks, grab and slice.I'm gonna do you a favor. You want a similar game where your protagonist is a cool killer with cool super powers? Get Dishonored instead of this crap! With all this combined, especially the unfocused blurry screen, you gonna be on the edge of grabbing the nearest pencil and stab your eyes with it.			"

												I'd like to say, I really enjoyed what I played........ which wasn't much. In all honesty I want my money back, because I can't play, I'm stuck because of shoddy level design. I made it to the brothel and when I take control of the darkling to skulk around the vents I can make it all the way through the vents until the end where I can't get past the final ""invisible wall"". I've wasted somewhere near 3 hours on this crap to no avail. YES I have tried turning off V-sync both in game and through my invidia control panel, yet still I can't get past it. Oh and theres no console so I can't just noclip past the lazily put together crap. So $30 dollars down the drain which I basically paid for a DEMO. Yeah this is just my experience and others have been able to use the v-sync trick to work around it but really this should not be a problem AT ALL from any AAA dev team. So in closing how does steam refunding work?			"

												A game befitting of its name, this is a dark and gruesome game.The game is taken from a comic book series with the same name.Graphics are cell shader and do a good job paying homage to the comic books it sprang from.The story is a highlight of the game, its clever with lots of humor (dark humor ;) and pokes fun at the gangster genres and overall reminded me of Spec Ops the Line. The game played well and shot well, which was good, but enemies were boring and the same models were just reskinned throughout each level. The best weapon in the game were the black holes; they were always graphically pleasing and satisying way to eleminate baddies.I don't recommend the darkness 2 because of its over the top voilence.I got tired of the repeated zoom-ins on 'darkness kills' (the darkness isn't just a metaphor for the darkside inside the proganist its also a evil spirit that manifests itself with tentacles that act as a send set of arms for your character).  The darkness kills are necessary to regenearte health/ammo but are acted out in such repeated brutality that you get tired of  beheadings and characters torn in half directly in front of the in-game camera.

Speaking of repetitive, were the level developers working on this game on DRUGS?! The levels have to be the MOST linear and boring thing I have ever experinced. Same exact  thing every single damn time.. same enemies.. The invisible walls in this game are just terrible. You cannot jump onto crates half the size of your body, you basically cannot jump on anything. The abilities get boring after 15 minutes. How people manage to play this for 5+ hour is beyond me.

												Shame the game has a.. game breaking bug when going into the monkey at the club and getting stuck on the vent. Other than that a good fps melee-shooter with bad weapon management and nice talent trees. Animations are dated but the storyline is okay. Rating negative for stupid bugs.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVsZkonR5lU "

												A good game, but doesn't live up to the first.One one hand, the game has a good story with a plot leading up to a major event. On the other hand, the ending is crap and almost feels like they cut the ending out for dlc that doesnt exist. And either I'm the master of video games, or this game is FAR shorter and FAR easier than its predecessor. Clocked less than 5 hours on my first playthrough? The original easily took me 10 on the ""same"" difficulty setting. Technically, if this was a stand alone game with no history, I'd call it a thrown together waste of money. A crappy length, way too easy. But the fact that I liked the first game mixes things up. They took stuff out, put stuff in, and its really mixed. Technically, the only thing stopping me from being full negative about it is that I loved the first.			"

												This game it is not a complete disaster, even though I do not personally recommend it.It's not recommended only if you've played the original The Darkness on console. In any case: this is what I call a missed opportunity. The Darkness II tries to continue the adventures of the unlucky Jackie Estacado, tormented by the death of his girlfriend Jenny, with The Darkness itself to spice the things up. As written in the comic books, Jackie is the carrier of an antique evil force that humans passed on from generations to generations constantly fighting its counterpart, the Light. In this chapter we'll se a mysterious cult who is pursuing him to steal his mystical power. Unfortunately, the plot is the weakest part of the experience, and it is a shame, because the gameplay is satisfying. Being the Darkness is a good experience, you can feel like an overpowered creature who can slaughter and kill everything it breathes. Although there are few powers that  you can play with, they're fun to use. Also the environment interaction is pretty good, in fact you can take various object with your demonic limb and throw them to your foes with enjoyable and squishy results. The game encourages you to do so in many different ways, as you can earn Dark Essence (XP) to unlock powers and abilities.The gunplay instead, it's sufficient: no recoil, the weapons sound and feel all over the same. The only difference you can tell about them is the fire ratio. It suffers from the modern FPS syndrome: high difficulty = enemies have lots of health points, so going further with the game usually is just trying and failing with a poor challenge. At least there's not regenerating health because you have to eat hearts from dead enemies in order to replenish it.There is also a limited multiplayer coop mode with 4 characters to choose from with different skills and abilities, but it adds nothing to the experience, it's just another excuse to shoot everything. Maybe this mode was built in order to extend the game length, because the singleplayer campaign is very short (about 6 hours).Do yourself a favor: if you own a PS3 or Xbox360 go and grab a copy of the first game. You won't be disappointed. "

So when I heard they were making a sequel I couldn't wait, but now after playing it, I didn't care about Jackie, I didn't care about the story, have the ability to use 4 different version of weapons almost simulationiously didn't seem to work for me, overall I think they took a huge step down.  I'm wondering if a third will be made now.  Either way not sure how excited I will be for it.			"

												""The Darkness"" was an amazing experience that i'll never forget. I'd even go as far as to say when someone asks me what my favorite game is/was that ""The Darkness"" is my favorite game, just because of how much of a lasting impression it left on me. As far as I know, it never got a PC release like TD2, but if you have a console, it's a slightly flawed gem but I highly recommend it. ...HOWEVER, The Darkness 2 is just awful. I mean, it's a competent shooter, and by the standard of just fps in general it's largely inoffensive aside from some obvious bugs, one of which was really annoying where my character would flat out get stuck in a vent until i pushed the steam screenshot button; it was the weirdest almost game breaking glitch i've ever seen in all of my years of playing video games. ...But that's not why you shouldn't play this game. If you're a fan of the first like I am or ever plan on playing the first, stay away from this game. It adds a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥to the canon that may have been following the graphic novel it's based on better, sure, but the first game did it's own interpetation and did it extremely well, and excels in every concieveable way over the second game from graphics, to story, to pacing, to gameplay in general. When i finished playing the Darkness 1 i was left with a feeling of ""Wow, that was a great game."" but after finishing this i was left with ""I wish i could ♥♥♥♥ing unplay this game, it was awful and repetitive and did something with Jenny's character that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me right the ♥♥♥♥ off. This whole game could have never happened and it would have changed nothing.""In a nutshell, if you EVER plan on playing The Darkness, steer clear of this game at all costs. If you don't, there are still better games you can buy with your money.			"

												Unimpressive across the board. The biggest problem with The Darkness 2 is the pacing. There is so much exposition in it. Every 10 minutes the game grinds down to a halt to have a drawn out dull conversation about nothing interesting at all. It gets tedious real fast. There must be two hours of dialogue in the game and it's all essentially meaningless nonsense. Sadly, it's the kind of game where it's really short and I'm grateful for it being short. It was only around 6 hours to finish the campaign. Another problem is the mechanic of the game that your character is super sensitive to light. Whenever there are bright lights around, the screen gets blurry and it's almost impossible to tell what's going on or where the light source is. It just makes the game confusing. The most thrilling part of the game was when Blind Melon's ""No Rain"" started playing in the background during one part. The graphics look like a 360 launch game. There's a bunch of screen tearing if vertical sync isn't turned one. The enemies arn't very fun to fight. The game can be really gross too. There's a bunch of  over the top gore and this game actually made me tired of hearing the f-word. A game like this really makes me appreciate, the nowadays, fewer and far between good FPS' out there. Don't bother with The Darkness 2.			"

I highly enjoyed the game from start to finish, and recommend it for anyone who is serious enough to take the story/game/adult stuff seriously.VERDICT:8 out of 10			"

This causes so much frustration its not even funny.Whip guy knocks your weapon into the pits of hell (Meaning you can never find your weapon again.)Why do the enemies get teleportation when you don't ever get the chance to teleport yourself?Spoilers: There.

												A terrible console port, the graphics seems like 720p, even when the res is set to 1080, the controls are horrible, with the mouse being set to what feels like 9000dpi first time you load the, wayyyyyyy too many cutscenes, and a story that lacks depth enough to keep you playing.2/10, cannot recommend.Also too easy, I set it to the second hardest difficulty, and I just blazed through everything.

												I got this game on sale because the premise sounded interesting and I liked the visual art. The game has great visuals  and some entertaining moments, but I would definitely not recommend buying it at full price. It's sad to see wasted potential in what could have been a great game.Good: * Visuals * Occasionally entertaining dialogue* Collectibles provide cool backstoryBad:* Flat characters and no development* Navmesh problems (you get stuck in vents a lot). Clearly not playtested enough before release.* Extremely linear levels.* Repetitive combat after a while.* Weak plot. Centers around Jackie never learning.  * The Darkness' voice sounds really stupid. Not at all what a powerful dark entity should sound like.			"

												ok in my opinion this game is a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥guns dont work ♥♥♥♥ing enemy are annoying as hell and the boss is mostly just a bullet sponge. the only gun that some what works is the dam pump the enemy's with the huge flash lights are a ♥♥♥♥♥ to kill thanks to them blinding you. along with it was fun haveing four minons runing around killing every thing now you have one that will repeat the same dame lines over and god dame over. along with the fact that the hack and slash way of doing things is 100% easyer and can actuly kill people seeing as how it takes so meany god dame shots to put some one down in this game. and then theres a ♥♥♥♥ing skill tree why in the hell is evey game that came out around this time have a ♥♥♥♥ing skill tree it is a agravating pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥that just adds a few more kill animations that give you health or ammo.

												Junk. Pure and simple, especially if you enjoyed the first one. The ideas are the same but the thing has lost its soul. Combat is awful, even though you have more powers, the combat is clunky and un-intuitive. You'll find yourself pressing buttons over and over during combat trying to just do or grab one thing but you'll often die because while you wanted to grab the guy to heal you just kept grabbing random thrown weapons. The story isn't as drawing as the first either, of course it's hard to get into a game when it isn't enjoyable to play. The game finally lost me at the boss battle with the crane and swifty. A truly horribly executed ""arena"" style boss battle that assaults you from every direction. No balance, no thought put into the execution, just bad. After ten tries I finally un-installed and moved on, back to Doom and Dishonored.        The game even looks like it took a step backwards, cell shading is a cop out. The first title played and looked better than this one.  In the end, if you want a great play, get the first Darkness, this is just a cheap shot at the wallet of fans of the first game, desperate to get a decent sequel to a very under rated title.			"

												Kind of a dull and straight-forward FPS, very console alike, reminds \""House of the Dead\"" - even with moder graphicss, you feel yourself trapped in puppet filled linear plot, that is not hooky at all. Sorry, not much tp tell, played less and hour and uninstalled it, was fooled by trailer - but hey, that\'s how game buisness works nowdays. If you ever played Clive Barker\'s Undying, Bioshock, Borderlands, FarCry or Deadspace, you will definetly have feeling of something lacking here. Or maybe I\'m too critical for the genre of FPS nowdays?			"

												Please, save yourself the 30 bucks, ESPECIALLY if you're a Mac user. Upon Jackie's surrender to The Darkness, the lower half of the screen becomes engulfed in a yellow fog that significantly reduces visibility and renders gameplay basically impossible. The online forums I've looked don't seem to be able to find a solution to this persistent problem, even though it seems as though most Macs (mine included) meet the recommended system requirements. Indeed, there even appeared to be quite a few PC users who were experiencing other problems with gameplay.It's a pity, as it seemed like a rather fun game, but until (or if) this bug gets fixed, I wouldn't waste my time trying to play through the yellow fog or any of the other numerous glitches this game seems to offer.

												The Darkness 2! Now with 2x more Darkness! Much WOW!Pros:-It's a first person shooter! OMG-It plays ok.-Controller support is always nice. Cons:-The protagonist is possessed by a demon. I was hoping it'd be an ""off brand"" creature if you will. Like spiderman's symbiote. Nope. -Supposedly a struggle against inner darkness. They hint at it. But the game is filled with loving camera angles of gory brutal executions and excessive bad language. Seems more like a celebration of darkness than a gripping struggle against inner darkness. -Aside from a few new mechanics, you've probably played this exact game before several times. It is another ""story FPS the game"" if you will. -Apparently only 5-6 hrs long, according to other reviewers. -How many FPS games do you need in your library? Why not buy a platforming game or a sports game or towerfall or something? Do you want a future where all games converge into only FPS?If you really want another shooter, compare this with Rainbow Six Vegas 2. Vegas 2's singleplayer is somewhat longer, has dynamic enemy ai, interesting level design, and has some people to play Terrorrist Hunt with for added replay value. The gunplay in Vegas 2 is also pretty compelling.(I played this for a half hour, I don't know why it sometimes looks like 0 hrs. ugh)			"

												Darkness II succeeds to achieve fantastic story with fun gameplay, that is quite rare with nowadays shooters. It is based on dark adult comic book full of blood, swear words and one romantic story. Game adapts story from comic book very well and it is accesible to non-readers as well. It is full of twists and one meaningful goal - your loved one. It may sounds boring or ""girllish"" but actually game makes you really care about them. Mafia setting works too. Gameplay is trying to differentiate from other FPSs by giving you two tentacles which you can control. This combined with the gun and light mechanics provides enough combat variability throughout the 6 hour campaign. There is also a co-op mode (or you can play it solo too) that fills some gaps in story that werent that importatnt, called Vendettas, where you can take control of characters with special abilities instead of tentacles. Overall i think, that Darkness is the best singleplayer experience in its genre since Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, if not better.			"

												Before continuing I want to offer a word of warning: The game is abysmally short. It's so short that one could mistake it for an expansion pack to an existing game.However, despite that rather huge shortcoming, it is a decent game that offers some interesting gameplay mechanics. The story is not shabby even though it deviates from the comic, but what will bring you back is the power of the Darkness. Although one could classify this game as a shooter it does offfer you the amazing power of the Darkness, which is only available, well, in darkness. This means that while you prowl in the shadows you are going to have some amazing powers. Playing through normal I felt almost like a god, and disposing your enemies with the powers at your fingertips is strangely satisfying.Ultimately this is a bargain game. Get it cheap and you will not regret it. It will offer 4-5 hours of fun gameplay that might even leave you waiting for a sequel that offers a bit more of what is presented.			"

												This is a fantastic sequel to the original game! The Darkness and The Darkness II have been and always will be my favorite fps games available. It doesn't take long to become powerful and enjoy ripping your enemies apart. It also has the most compelling story of any fps available. They don't make a scale big enough to measure my love for this incredibly dark visceral game with impressive story telling. TLDR: Buy the damn game.			"

												I recommend this game to anyone who likes to pick things up and just throw them at people. I would have to say that this game gave me the idea that you basically have 4 hands and those 4 hands are the most badass couple around. When you can dual-welid weapons, it makes you feel so good, and then when you pick items up and chuck them at people, it's pretty much an insta kill which is really awesome. Some of the cutscence were boring but I should have never skipped them. One caught my attention and that was when he told us  It's like you are in the movie and you look good, feel good, and you feel like the good guy, but everyone else is screaming, and its a horror film, and your the monster. It's not word for word but that's just how I remember it.  Anyway. This is a really fun but short game. I have never played the first game so I don't follow the story at all but I do get why he vision Jenny all the time. Also, a very gory game and I love the executions and the feel of the game in general.			"

												Short, but pretty fun. I personally prefer the first, but this has quite a few twists and turns that were nice. Gameplay is fluid, though melee is a bit clunky. It's about the length and production value of a 20 dollar game, so I think the price is fine. It's about four hours long, it's got fun, it's got some interesting completely non-violent sections, it's good.			"

												This game flips from making you feel like a badass one moment and a powerless ghoul the next. I can see how that game wouldn't be that much of a challenge if you got to use your Darkness powers all the time, but it never feels like they got the balance quite right. And it's short. Really short. Beat it in one sitting short. Pick it up if you like the comics.			"

The story is decent, but the game-play is repetitve and the developers like to do cheap tricks such as locking doors behind you as you enter rooms full of monsters and just spawning guys all over the place.  If you are bored and this game is really cheap, you might want to buy it.  I got about 11 hours of game-play out of it.			"

												A STRONG sequel to one of my early favourites on the Xbox 360. The game uses a great cell-shadey look too it, which is not too much, and gives the thing a real stylish presentation. The integration of the Darkness' powers with the running-and-gunning feels really smooth, and there're some great animations when using the Darkness serpents. Unfortunately, the game is only about 6-7hrs long, and really feels lacking in a lot of the story. The world of The Darkness as presented in the game(s) seems awesome, but it's a shame that this game doesn't have more too it. Also, the fights can get a little repetitive and/or annoying in the back half, though never to the point of me quitting in frustration.This is a great looking, great playing game with an awesome premise and (for the most part) satisfying action Here's to seeing what they do with a potential sequel!RECOMMENDED!

												Campaign Review:The art style is a cross between Borderlands and the Godfather game (I know, go figure)The voice acting is top notch. It definitely helps you get attached to both Jenny and Jackie.The story was very well written, the dialogue was nothing short of excellent. Plenty of firearms choices -- nothing original though -- at least until the last level (not gonna spoil it though)The Darkness powers are AWESOME. You feel like a dark, f***ed up GOD. The kill animations are brutal to say the least. At one point or another, you'll find yourself ripping someone's spine out through their ♥♥♥♥♥♥. This game isn't for the weak of heart, in that regard.There are two endings -- but you can choose what you wish.My favorite character was a tie between the Darkling and Johnny. The Darkling is a british demon wearing a union jack shirt. He's nothing short of hilarious. He's very sarcastic and playing as him is a nice treat. Newman nailed him. That squirrelly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Johnny struck me as the tin-foil hat type and didn't feel very out of place in this type of game. He was a good addition. Onto my favorite aspect and my rating:My absolute favorite bits in this game had to be how DE tried very hard (and, for the most part, succeeded) to make you severely question which was real -- the asylum or the world with the Darkness.One of the endings -- I won't say which -- could make for an interesting sequel, but honestly I don't think It would last more than a couple hours.I give this game an 8 out of 10.  I got it on sale for $6, but for what I just played through... I'd say it's worth the full $32 dollar price tag			"

												Some may say the pc controls are flawed, but in my opinion, that's just knitpicking, the only issue i have encountered with the controls of this game, is the demon arm slash button's default button is binded to what i think is, an awkward button for combat purposes, m3, seeing as m3 is also used to scroll through weapons, it can make it awkward to use as you might accidently switch weapons instead, this made me end up forgetting time to time to use the demon slash as i was continuesly thinking ""m3-weapon switch"" and forgot to use it occasionally. The art style is superb, the thick black outlines of characters give it a nice noir comic book style look, this art style in particular in this game reminds me of a hybrid of team fortress 2 and borderlands, it has that nice cartoon look but under that when you start firing its quite gorey. Speaking of the gore, it is amazingly well done but some of the finisher moves can end up a tad repetitive. The plotline is much better than i anticipated.			"

												Co-Op is sick! single player due to the characters unique darkness powered weapons (Katana, early 1900's style double pistol, a ""Mystic"" style Skull on a stick... and a very ""Thors Axe"" type of weapon) each character is amusing for the 4 player co-op and some missions are allowed to be played 1 player to try out the characters etc, they all have ups and downs, but The Japanese Wielding the katana is my favorite, the darkness weapons to ""Eat Hearts"" and execute rathe the alien type growths out of Jackies Arms in Single Player; which great as well, to me if I had to grade, Single Player would get a solid 85 (the story is VERY good as are the missions, just too short, MIKE PATTON Voices ""DARKNESS"") whileCo-Op a solid 88-90; may raise, but many missions are locked until others are completed or SP is fully completed, will update!!

												Traditional single-player FPS that mixes gunplay with the ""Power of the Darkness"". Obviously, as the title of the game implies, the darkness is what makes this game what it is. The two demons hanging over your shoulder mix suprisingly Very well with the gunplay aspect. Gunplay is traditional, but handled well, giving the player the choice of Dual-Weilding two different handheld weapons or sticking to one big gun (Shotgun, Assault Rifle, etc.), similar to Max Payne 3. Gameplay is fast paced and brutal, given the fact that your practicaly playing as a demon. Ripping people apart, decapitating, and even pulling someones spine out of their♥♥♥♥♥♥are all part of the disturbing yet oh-so-satisfying executions the player can bring. As far of the story goes, Its simple but gripping. Characters are interesting and are cleverly written, and the voice acting in this game is Outstanding. None of the characters feel out of place and are even humorus at appropriate times, epecially your AI companion, the Darkling. The only real problem with the game is its length. It can be completed in nearly 6-7 hours. There are relics you can collect during missions, but the secret hunting dosent add too much replayability by itself. Overall, the Darkness 2 is a very fun game and definatly not a waste of time. Definatly worth a buy during a sale or even a rent.OVERALL(+) Darkness/Gunplay combo works well(+) Story, Voice acting, Characters (Johnny Powell and the Darkling are probably the best)(+) Comic book style graphics work well for the games theme(+) Brutality is handled well(+) Secrets are interesting, worth finding(+) Refreshing change of pace from other generic shooters(-) Too Short(-) Not much replayability(-) Not much to do in-between missions(-) The Ending (It hints toward a third game)Final Score: 7.5/10 "

												Picked this up in the Humble 2K Bundle, so I can't complain at all, not that I'm going to.The Darkness 2 is has wonderful, although slightly short, campaign with beautiful and diverse settings, and a strong storyline. I had to crank the difficult up to 'Don' for there to be any real challenge, and I found that the darkness powers where slightly lacking when I was running around with a semi-automatic shotgun, pumping rounds into enemies faces.Similarly, the mobs where all stock-type enemies such as the basic gun-man, a tank, and a melee-er, with the addition of a whip-weilding mob who was the bane of the gameplay, as they kept pulling the guns out of my hands and letting them fall into a pile of inferior weapons; so I would spend a few minutes soaking damage and scavenging through all the weapons on the floor to find my striker again.Regaurdless, the Darkness 2 is an enjoyable game to play through, and as I said, for about 30p, I wouldn't ever complain!

												If you want to go from one stage to the next, progressing the story you are constantly given new things to do and experience as Jackie, who you play as, gets more abilities. This keeps the engagement fun and exciting. That being said, if you play the game in this manner you will probably finish the game in 4-6 hours. But 4-6 hours of good story pacing and engaging and changing gameplay is more than many other titles are delivering; this makes The Darkness II a stellar game in my book. Besides being well paced, the story is pretty enjoyable, even with what feels like being being told ""No, mister bond, I expect you to die"" a few times. If you're a completionist, interested in collecting and hearing about all the relics in this game you will it wont take you too long to grab it all, which I think is nice as it doesn't become too tedious.If you're looking for a challenge, the 'Don' difficulty mode does make it harder, you can't Rambo in with your darkness powers  -- as much as the lower difficulties. But this game doesn't pose much in terms of highly difficult challenges that will take you many tries.Biggest problem? Graphical glitches. Sometimes the screen would get blurry and stay blurry, only coming out if you could trigger a cutscene, area change or use an upgrade portal. It's a big bummer because it really impacts the gameplay and enjoyable art style.Overall a fun single player game, I have no experience with the mutliplayer.			"

												The angst-fueled action junkie's dream game: a first-person shooter where you're one part Scarface and one part Satan. It's goal is to make you feel like an unstoppable train of supernatural violence and it does so with sadistic glee. A mass of vaporous snakes surround the player that hack enemies to pieces, throw objects to crush or impale them, or drag them away to be executed in grisly fashion. Area-of-effects like insect swarms and black holes are showboatingly overpowered in their ability to rend apart large groups of enemies. Even the standard gunplay, which includes dual-wielded weapons, can be assisted by the Darkness in turning your gunshots into wisps of energy to reduce adversaries to soup. The environments have been simplified a great deal from the original and its stereotypical comic book plot and machismo grit are turned up way past eleven. Other action titles have tried to make you feel like a monstrous force of nature, but none of them are nearly as successful as The Darkness.			"

												This game is very unique and that's what I love about it. It is based off of a comic series where you play as a mob boss named Jackie who has inherited an ancient power known as ""The Darkness,"" which is basically two tentacle-like creatures coming out of your back. The combat can be ""quad weilding,"" using the two Darkness tentacles and two firearms simultaneously. The tentacles can be used to pick up, tear apart, throw,and slash eniemies into oblivion. The game is very short (6-8 hours) but it is a great story. You don't need to play the first game to understand what is happening in this. The end leaves you at sort of a cliffhanger, and from what I've read, there may be a Darkness III in production. The graphics look very nice, even on my low-end PC and it runs very well too. There are a few minor texture errors, but nothing too big that affects the gameplay. There is a multiplayer feature too, but from my experience, it is dead most of the time.With all of that said, I'd give the game an 8/10 and well worth $5.			"

												This was a dark, mature, and suspense filled game. The storyline was superior to most games. Though personally not a fan of the cell shaded graphics style, the game's other attributes make it easy to enjoy. The experience already has me looking forward to The Darkness III. The only bug I encountered throughout the entire game was a common one where, while playing as the minion, you can get stuck in some ventilation shafts. But this was easily fixed simply by turning on vertical synchronization in the graphics options. All things considered, this game easily deserves another 9 out of 10.			"

												4-5 hours.Short? Yeah, but for me it was perfect, and while I am not usually a fan of cliffhanger endings, this was certanly a good one. I wont spoil anything but I definately recommend this game, but I will warn you that it is fairly short (though I dont think the game was supported with a large budget, so maybe the lenght could be forgiven?). One should also mention that the game is paced very well and you are always curious about what happens next in the game.I would give it 9/10 due to great characters, interesting story, and fun gameplay. The only thing that stops this game from being perfect (in my opinion) is the length and the fact that the game ends with a cliffhanger (again, it is a good one).I really hope for a  next installment in the series, and I certanly hope that more people will  buy this game so that 2K will make a third game happend!

												Very impressed.  I picked this up on the Humble Bundle, after seeing only 15 min of gameplay at a friend's house.  The gore factor of this game is over 9000.  The abilities you get to weild are just awesome.  Rip a guy's sheild right out of his hands and take his head off with it by chucking it at his face.  This game has the abilities you WISH you had in other games.  Like being able to wipe out a room of enemies by throwing an acquired Black Hole into the middle of the room.Very solid story line, and the characters have definite presence to them.  You start off on a blind date with 2 blonde twins.  Just as you start talking to them the girl's eye on the left is blown out of its socket by a gunshot, next thing you know, a car rams the table through the window.  One foot charred and burning, your friend drags you away, hands you a gun, and thugs start blasting you.  You shoot your way to the kitchen and discover the gas is on the door is locked.  Someone yells ""Burn in hell"" and you watch a molotov thrown in slow motion into the kitchen -BOOM-  You wake up bloodied and burning in the kitchen.  You drag yourself to the exit as a voice screams in your head to let the darkness out and that it is your only salvation.  You crawl over to the enemy guy offer you a hand up and a bullet in the brain, but before he can you unleash the Darkness within you, and litterally shred 3-4 thugs with the power at your command.  And then the fun starts....Story 9/10Graphics/Aesthetics 9/10Gameplay 9/10Audio 9/10 "

												As a fan of the original Darkness game, i was left wondering if the sequel would deliver on the same level. While the game is fun, it doesnt have the same emotional kick as the original. Though, it does try, and succeed to a point. The gameplay is solid, and standard FPS controls apply. Fighting entirely with the Darkness is exceedingly difficult to do, so you'll spend most of your time wielding guns. Unlike in the original, you can't simply impale an enemy with a darkness attack. Using the Darkness is however, extremely fun. I found myself trying to spear as many enemies onto a wall as possible with whatever object that came to hand. The execution styles i never used much, i tended to just perform health executions, and there are about three execution animations for each type. The game is bloody, and the graphics are enjoyable, though they're clearly meant to take on a more comic like feel, which it doesnt always succeed in. The game is surprisingly short in comparision to the original, and i finished it in just under five hours of play. I've logged more hours just trying to find collectables, and nailling enemies to walls. (Don't judge me!) it's a fun game overall, with a good amount of story depth, basic controls, and occasionally amusing dialogue. It's held back by how limited the Darkness powers are, in comparison to the comics, as well as how short the game is. Definitely good for a play, though maybe wait for it to be on sale.			"

												Short Story but really fun to play. Though a bit buggy if you move into those small spaces or when you crouch and go through small tunnels (I had a hard time trying to move around there). But anything around that, it was fun!I couldn't get used to using 4 different buttons to fire, attack, aim and melee on my XBOX controller. Normally, its LT and RT. This game leverages on using RB and LB too for your Darkness powers.Storyline was great! It was captivating and really showed us the possibilities of having such a power in the real world (or is it the real world?). There weren't alot of decision making in the game. In fact, I counted 2. So not a lot of thinking or choice of what to do with the story.Graphics, looks like something that came from a PS2 game but its steady and playable still. Especially that one part where it went really gore and horrific in the game that it just gets my heart pumping harder and faster because of its play with the dark (less light = more scary). Recommended to play in a room with no lights.Audio was great. Voiceovers were as expected of an Italian Mob to actually have that kind of various accents.Other than that, worth while gaming experience. My personal rating: 6.5/10			"

												The Darkness was one of my favorite shooters on the console, specificially because it was a shooter with a good storyline.  Darkness II continues that storyline in a very satisfactory manner: the game does a really good job of fleshing out the characters through Jackie's monologues, to the point that you actually care about them.Combat is really fun and satisfying: one instant, you're powerful as can be, and tearing through enemies; the next, you're running for cover.  Its a nice way of giving you bursts of fun, but not letting you get too used to ravaging through ever person you see.Overall, this is a great game.  It gets a bad rap for being too short, but really, it felt just about right: too much more and there would have been significant amount of filler; instead, it kept the story well-paced, and didn't let the action get stale.

												A brutal FPS with a few psychological thriller elements, the Darkness II is not for the faint of heart. The game puts you in the shoes of tormented mob boss Jackie Estacado, hereditary host of the malevolent supernatural being known only as the Darkness. Struggling to keep the evil contained within him, Jackie is pushed to his breaking point by a powerful organization interested in drawing that evil out. And so the game beings.With the Darkness unleashed Jackie is a force to be reckoned with. The Darkness is extremely powerful and dispatches of enemies in the cruelest and most horrifying ways imaginable, while at the same time nourishing Jackie and keeping him alive. The Darkness fears only one thing, the light. So whenever you see a source of light, you should destroy it right away. But with all his power Jackie's fragile state of mind can't take the stress and soon he finds himself unable to tell reality from hallucinations and that is the highpoint of the game's narrative. Is any of this even happening? Is there really a Darkness? Yes the story is gripping and very very interesting indeed.So highly recommended? Well, no. Regardless of how great a story it tries to tell, as a game it could still be much better. At its core this is an FPS, but despite Jackie's outlandish abilities it is still too limited. All you can do is stand in the middle of a dozen enemies and shoot them or use the darkness to destroy them. That is all, no real tactics, no sneaking, nothing. After a while it just get tedious. Thankfully the game is very short, so at least you won't notice this as much. But still with a story as interesting, I wish they had paid some more attention to the game itself.I will still recommend this game. If only for the narrative and the atmosphere it creates. But this is a weak recommendation.			"

												I played this on the Xbox 360 and beat it. Loved it. It came in a Humble Bundle with X-Com: Enemy Unknown, Bioshock 1-2, Infinite, and some other titles. As of this review, I have not booted the PC version to see if it suffers from any porting issues.The game as it stood when I played it had a nice dark, visceral story about mobsters, monsters, and anti-heroes and the thin line that seperates them all. The mechanics are straight-forward but fun, and while the levels are fairly linear, the story keeps you focused on itself rather than the lack of directions to choose from.There's a decent variety of weapons and powers which should keep you entertained through the duration of the game. The story is great, even better if you played the first game, but not absolutely required. Voice acting is top notch. All in all this was a really fun game and I'm glad I own it once more.8/10. Would play again after 72 other titles in my library.			"

												This game takes a different turn compared to the The Darkness 1Jaccckkiiieee.. Come .. to the dark...So you have a entity inside you called The Darkness and it basically makes you a god... When the lights are turned out that is,You can shoot your enemies with guns and stuff, ... but I had much more fun slashing my way through with Demon Arms and ungodly powers such as Black holes and brutal excecutions like the Wishbone or Anaconda, this game is brutal, the graphics took a different turn of that of the comic, such like Borderlands and a old game called XIII (13) if you ever played it, the story continues with Jack Estacado now Mob Boss that rivals the power of the Darkness, it's quite scary actually that they have the power to take on something as powerfull as The Darkness in a epic duel and still come out alive, Story, Guns, lots of death and brutalness, I can't fathom on how powerful the Darkness is untill you actually play it, if you've played the first one, you'll question it at first, but just let it do its thing, you'll come out with a smile on your face.Yes, Jenny is still with us :DI suggest buying it on sale like I did during the Humble Bundle as I paid something ridiculous like £2 for a £15 game.

												Fantastic game, great fun! Tons of abilites and weapons to use which can be upgraded which makes The Darkness II different from your average first person shooter. Shame the storyline was a little short, but nonetheless enjoyed it all the same. Would definately recommend this game and would love to see The Darkness III.			"

												Personally the Darkness 2 is one of my favourite games on Steam as it delivers something completely different, It's a shooter and a hack n slash story based game with it's own superb artistic graphic style, gameplay is fluid and the main campaign whilst short must be played through twice to appreciate Jackie's dark powers. Also the Darkness 2 has a completely seperate story mode were you play as 4 different individuals who have their own dark powers which adds a pleasant surprise for anyone looking for more from the Darkness 2.""An Awesome Game Highly Underrated"".

												the ""beautiful"" animation made me to look further about this game, blood splatterin all over the place, slit throat, decapitate head and stuff. so i bought it for like $5 on sale.as i reach to my 1h gameplay, i just cant stop playing. why ?+ 1st, the solid story, the longer u play the more curious u are.+ the beautiful background music. (especially, the one in the asylum)+ all the POKING PEOPLE WITH POLE, SLASHING, CUTTING PEOPLE IN HALF WITH CAR DOOR dat just felt so goood.and the 1 point that make this game even better, also made me sad.+ cliffhanging ending.+ the empty feeling it left u behind, just like when ur watching a really good movie or read a great book, and it come to an end.and here's the thing that i hate about this game- story too short...but hey, still the best $5 i ever spent on videogame. 8h gameplay full of joy!and still hoping there will be the next The Darkness.

												Darkness II is a very enjoyable game! I never played the first game and I was a bit worried that I would miss out on some key story details because of this. However this did not turn out to be the case, the games intro did a very nice job of getting caught up and throwing me right into the chaos of the story. Combat was very fluid, the action consistant and fast paced and the story easy to follow.... perhaps a bit too easy to follow as it was very predictable. Controls were addiquit, not great but not complicated (I played with mouse/keyboard). Graphics were outstanding when you consider the game was going for the cartoon look. The one major knock I have on the game is the amount of content. My first playthrough took five hours while finding nearly every relic. That's right five hours! That in mind I highly suggest the game but NOT at a full retail price, snag it for $10 or less on sale and you have yourself a great way to kill an evening!			"

												A well made continuation of the VIDYER GAME Darkness storyline, although some people might be turned off to the design compared to the REALISM SHOOTY STORM of the first one, it doesn't look like complete garbage like other cell-shade games. It is more linear than the console shooter, but it can focuse more on story and there is less side-quests to randomly do. Micromanaging the Gremlins was a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥so I'm glad they went to just one that showed up every now and then. The boss-fights were challanging, but fun in their own rights, and the final sequence was a great change of pace.The parts akin to ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" were well done, and really helped show how strained Jackie's relationship to the Darkness is, and the parts with Jenny were near heart-rending. So I applaud Digital Extremes for their work.			"

												This game was AWESOME.  The single player campaign was about 5 hours of non-stop slaughter.  The plot was solid.  You have a wonderful mix of traditional guns, dual wielding and then ""darkness"" powers.  There are a variety of gruesome finishing moves, lots of special abilities, and talent trees for you to get even more new ways to kill things.  The more creative you are, the more points you get, the more fun you have.  It's a lot like Bulletstorm, which if you haven't played, you should.  Another great game.  After the main campaign there is an entire other bonus campaign that you can do alone or co-op.  That, plus the random extra mini missions added another 4 hours of gameplay for me.  It also has a new game + mode so that you can keep going and max out all of your talent trees.  Awesome game that goes on sale, so keep an eye out!			"

												The Darkness II is an exceptional single-player experience that excells graphically and in storytelling. Almost all of the secondary NPCs are inconsequential and I feel the story could have accomplished so much more if the writers put in a little more work on fleshing out the world, but the main characters have very strong performances. The gunplay is tight and the addition of the tech trees provide incentive to try new ways to defeat opponents. Unfortunately there are times when it feels you're being thrown into waves of enemies without a rationale and the level design only feels inspired in the asylum and Hell.Overall, it comes recommended for at least a single playthrough and there is a New Game+.

												A short but enjoyable linear shooter with some interesting and different mechanics to set it apart from competitiors.  The story is ok, nothing too complicated. The game's visuals aren't bad, the carnival level stood out as a particularly good looking place, all grimy and wrecked.  The darkness inside of you has some pretty gory attacks, ripping peoples spines from them, and you can rip out their hearts to replace lost health.  There are 4 talent trees, but didn't make a whole lot of difference to the game.In summary, a short linear shooter with enough gore and nasty attacks to keep you interested the whole way through.  Took me 7 hours.			"

												Set after a couple of years from the events of the ""The Darkness"", Jackie Estacado, now the leader of his own gang of mobsters, is targeted by a mysterious cult known as ""The Brotherhood"" who wishes to take the Darkness for themselves.Pro's: - Great story, how Jackie interacts with the Npc's and enviroments are very well done.- Fun gameplay, Use anything as a weapon to slice or inpale your foes on, or better yet, just shoot them the hell up.- Great Voice acting, many of the original voiceover's from the first game make a great return and are a treat to listen to.- Beautiful graphics, while many of the characters have a sorta ""realistic cel-shaded"" texture, and the backgrounds are not, it helps make characters pop out from the grim and dreary landscape.Con's:- Too Short, Though the story is great.. it can be beaten within 4-5 hours.- Confusing at times, Sometimes when you are trying to eat a heart.. your left tendril grabs a different gun instead.- Low Ammo, ammo is very scarce in the game, which is normally fine, but when you are using SMG's that require a lot of bullets... it gets tedious spam the ""ammo kill"" since most enemies will have protection against the Darkness attacks after the half way point.Rating: 8/10			"

												The Darkness is a character from the Witchblade-universe of Top Cow comics. Having read more then 100 comics from the universe, I certainly know what the story is all about. Unfortunately Steam as not the first game in hte series, but that is OK; this  is a story on its own.The Darkness has a unique fighting style and I LOVE it. The two heads of the Darkness, can grap about anything and throw its minion. The minion is a sadist and thinks you are too. You can play as the minion, the Darkness and Jackie, but all at the right time in the story.Visually the game is great, especially for a comic book recreation. The story is good and does not feel like a 20 page comic book but rather ten or twenty comic books  And, more important, I liked the story.I recommand the game to anyone, fans of the comic book series and newbies in Top Cows universe. Its just fun!			"

												Good GraphicsSolid Story and the gameplay stays fresh throughout the game with various ways to kill/tear enemies apart(executions,weapons,slashes,objects)...choose and mix it up yourself!The only weak point of the game for me is its lenght...finished it on hitman difficulty(second highest)in just 5.3 hours :(Although there is a new game+ with all of the previous unlocked abilities and Vendettas(a co-op online) that can double/triple the lenght of the game.

												The Darkness II is an exceptional single-player experience that excells graphically and in storytelling. Almost all of the secondary NPCs are inconsequential and I feel the story could have accomplished so much more if the writers put in a little more work on fleshing out the world, but the main characters have very strong performances. The gunplay is tight and the addition of the tech trees provide incentive to try new ways to defeat opponents. Unfortunately there are times when it feels you're being thrown into waves of enemies without a rationale and the level design only feels inspired in the asylum and Hell.Overall, it comes recommended for at least a single playthrough and there is a New Game+.

												Good game. Probably worth 15-20 bucks. Really fun but only like 5 hours long. Probably the most violent game I've ever played. Any game that lets you shoot a guy, pick him up with a tentacle, rip his spinal cord out of his♥♥♥♥♥and then use his pelvis as a projectile to cut another dude in half is okay in my book.			"
