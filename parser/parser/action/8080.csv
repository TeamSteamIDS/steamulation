												This is such an underrated game.  The characters are what really sold me on this game.  Unlike other series in which you play as ""bad guys"" who ultimately tend to do the right thing, Kane and Lynch are 100% scumbags.  Kane is a self-serving, traitorous sociopath and Lynch is just completely mental.  It's a real treat to see how they interact with each other and how their personalities affect the storyline. The combat is good, not great.  The cover system is a little wonky and the AI is outright terrible at times, but I was always having enough fun that these issues didn't bother me much.  Shooting feels off at first, but as you progress and get a feel for the weapons, it becomes a total joy.  You really get the feel of desperation that would accompany a heist gone wrong leading into a frantic shootout with the cops (like I would know).  Kudos to whoever did the sound for the weapons, I haven't heard beefier sounding assault rifles in any other game!The graphics are pretty mediocre, and look like what you'd expect from a non triple-A title in 2007.  That being said, the levels you play in are more than interesting enough to make up for it.  You'll go from banks and upscale office buildings to the streets and rooftops of Tokyo to Havana in the middle of a political revolution.  One of my favorite set pieces was a gunfight in a busy nightclub, which seemed to be lifted straight out of the movie ""Collateral.""Overall, this is a solid game with a few flaws that stand out, but definitely won't ruin the experience of playing as such interesting characters in such interesting situations.  And for only $6.99 (down from $60 when it came out) you can't go wrong giving it a try!			"

												The Game:Kane & Lynch: Dead Men is a dark and gritty drama featuring two men, one is a flawed mercenary and the other a medicated psychopath. Forced together on a violent and chaotic path of redemption and revenge, no action is considered too harsh as this volatile partnership is pushed beyond reason in this brutally realistic, character-driven third person action shooter.The Bad:- Accuracy is very bad- Voice Acting will sometimes overlap and/or glitch out- A.I. partners feel awkward- The Ending left something to be desired forThe Good:- Fun commentary from Kane & Lynch- Lots of exciting levels- Feels healthy when compared to other games made in this generation- Story is well executedThe Review:Kane & Lynch easily earns its mature rating, with ferocious, bloody attacks and an excessive use of swear words. Essentially a third-person shooter with some simple squad commands, it is an uninspired, frustrating action experience. For example, to jump into cover, you simply run up to an obstacle. Sounds easy enough, except you have to run into a wall or obstacle a couple times before you ""click"" into cover.Targeting is just as irritating. Gunshots seem a hair off almost every time. Computer-controlled players prefer to play hide-and-seek rather than to engage in heated battles. Kane & Lynch showed promise with a strong story, but after a few levels it turns up dead on arrival. Overall, however, the game is an enjoyable piece of software that will keep you entertained in its sub-par length game of approx. 5 hours.			"

												Kane and lynch, is not an underrated gem, by any means  as some would claim, Its just an above average third person shooter with a crime story including two, sociopaths, Kane and lynch. You play as Kane in the single-player campaign mode , haven't played multiplayer as I don't even know if its alive or I dont want to do anything related with GFWL.           The gameplay is pretty much average and feels wonky , the story is also not that fantastic, but once you happen to start the game, you would want to finish it no matter what, I took two 5 hour sessions to complete this game, even though it has its flaws, but overall its above average, and you would not want to lay the campaign in SP mode once you complete it once. Graphics-wise  its an old game with mediocre graphics in today's standards , but the graphics was not painfully bad as of its age.             It has excessive profanity and tries to appeal as a dark narrative  and adult friendly game but fails at execution and the final product turns out to be like a violent average B-rated movie, which has its moments but, didn't impress me too much , although I would recommend it for a one time gameplay which was worth the $2 dollars at the time of sale. So yeah, if you want a few hours of fun, get it in a sale , or buy it anyway as its only 7 dollars if your very desperate to try it out.  I would give it a 6.5 out of 10.			"

												Kane & Lynch: Dead Men is a slightly above-average third person shooter (for its time), starring two of the most interesting characters of the gaming world. While you shouldn't expect great and varied gameplay, it's a game I would still recommend to fans of crime shooters and movies like Heat.The game got a bad reputation because of the Gamespot controversy, but it has nothing to do with the quality of the game itself.PROS+ A character-driven story starring Kane and Lynch, which make this game series memorable.+ Environment is never repetitive: each level is set in a different location.+ Shootouts are spectacular, and some are quite large-scale (like the Tokyo and Havana levels).+ Splitscreen co-op.CONS- Single-player story is short.- No online co-op.- Clunky gameplay and gunplay.- AI has some issues that sometimes break the immersion.- You have to manually install GFWL through the game's folder in order to play the game.

												This game is an odd one. Every single criticism that you've heard about this game just might be valid, but that still doesn't hinder my recommendation of this game. Yes, the recoil on the guns is absurd. This isn't a problem, because bullets are much more damaging when they actually hit what you want them to.Yes, the graphics are dated, but it's early 360/PS3 graphics, so that makes more sense than it would otherwise. Yes, the characters are all but unlikable. However, this seems to be intentional, as IO interactive stated in an interview before release that you shouldn't be trying to do so. Think about movies like The Departed. There's nobody to root for, not even the titular protagonists. Fortunately, the further you progress, the more that Kane and Lynch ♥♥♥♥ up. The characters, not the game. Yes, the story is confusing, but it's only confusing if you don't bother to put the puzzle pieces together and try to figure out the facts from what little information. It's like the story in Dark Souls in that way. The only difference is that this is fresh territory that nobody has bothered to theorycraft yet, so go nuts blazing a trail that nobody's blazed before. Yes, I had some problems with Games for Windows Live, but i was able to install the program for it and log in with my Microsoft Account that i use to login to Windows 10. You even get achievements for Xbox for playing with it on. It's really not much of a hassle when playing this game with it. It's like an annoying friend that knows when to shut the ♥♥♥♥ up.			"

												Kane & Lynch: Dead Men, directly from the darkest recesses of the minds of the children of IO Interactive, creators of Hitman and Freedom Fighters underestimated, is a title difficult and inconvenient to evaluate. Difficult because it is full of good ideas unfortunately not always well done, uncomfortable because in these times of mania censorship and witch hunt, is a game that does everything to be tipped as amoral and violent. Stuff to embarrass any GTA.If Tommy Vercetti and Carl Johnson could be sympathetic in their raids towns, Kane & Lynch on the contrary are the classic antiheroes, two shady characters sadistic and ruthless than any other video game or movie would be the perfect antagonists. There is nothing heroic about them, there is no possibility that it clicks a minimum of empathy for the two hardened criminals.In most hate and detest and do nothing to hide: their constant foul language is there to prove it. Killers and robbers without remorse, killing machines rated the massacre without respect for anyone. The beginning of the story is withering. The two are, from complete strangers on the bus that takes them to death row when they are freed by an armed part of the gang called ""The Seven"". Kane, accused of stealing their money, will take a few days to bring them back, otherwise he will be killed the family.What's more the flank Lynch, a schizophrenic tangled with slight problems of self-control, to watch him and help him in the mission impossible.From this moment everything that moves, especially when wearing a blue uniform and a star on the chest, it is shot down regardless. Traveling between California and Japan, attacking banks, skyscrapers and even becoming street in a crowded nightclub, all told by their voices and cut scenes made with the game engine, exquisitely cut film			"

												The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.This pretty much sums characters in this game, the good though is probably the most arguably but that depends on point of view and certain characters. In this game your protagonist is a bad guy, no deny on this one, stone cold murders that would kill you on sight if you would encounter them. And this makes this game really good in term of the storyline, its very nice to see action different then we usually do. Of course its fast third person shooter so don`t expect ""The Kite Runner"" hearth-breaking storyline that will make you cry, or that will lead you to some serious toughts like for example ""Spec Ops: The Line"" did. But for this genre it`s really good with strong language and sometimes really violent moments.Let`s talk about graphics, which is great too, its game from 2007 so it`s not perfect today but its still really good, great i would say with awesome with awesome destructible environment, another game from years ago which has this awesome feature which is adding load of immersion into the game and what`s still very rarely using in videogames.From the other hand, i can`t say much about the music, i think it`s ok, at best, nothing that i would hate but just after i beat the game on highest difficulity settings i can`t really remember any track from the entire game, nothing at all. I guess if i would rate it it would be like 5/10 just because it`s not bad, doesn`t make you want cut then eat your ears, but that`s like i said nothing spectacular and you will probably forget it just after you quit the game like i did.Speaking about difficulity level, its nothing special too, on highest difficulty like i was playing you will die or fail mission here and there but that`s mostly in situations where you are just flooded with countless enemies that are shooting at you from every angle. Otherwise its really easy.Unfortunately game cover mechanics ain`t the best i`ve ever seen, it works ok usually but ofter you will find yourself in those clunky situations where you want to take cover while you`re under heavy fire but your character will just refuse to stick to this particular cover. Controls though are very fluent and i did not have any problems with the game itself.I would strongly reccomend you this game when its on sale, it`s really worth to spend few dollars on it. very short but i would say condensed experience if you are into third person cover shooters.I had load of fun with the game and i hope you will too.Also game has co-op which will give you load of fun with your buddy ! Definitely should try this on outFrankcastle51 out.PS. I could say that full price is definitely not appropriate to game lenght and overall experience but when its on sale, get it :)			"

												Live a 18 rated action movie.The Good:* Captures the look, feel & language of a Tarantino movie* Great characters that really fit their parts* Diverse locations make the most of it's cinematic leanings* Action is delivered in set-pieces that have a natural flow* Guns are horribly inaccurate which is oddly a good thing* Buddy AI was good and the revival system (as copied in FarCry2) is neat* Nice simple objectives and weapons system* Great weapon soundsThe Bad:* On Steam you have to manually installed Games for windows (xliveredist/) before it will start* Engine shows it's age with tearing and jaggy shadows* Many set-pieces are too easy, at odds with the hardcore feel* Dumb enemy AI breaks the immersion as cops charge you* Environment interferes with your aim but cops shoot through walls* Cover mechanic is awkward and often fails to trigger* Violence is hardcore (to men and women)* Ending is anticlimatic after a perfect set-up.* 5-6 hours tops and you are done.Background: Had heard good and bad about it but was interested by the characters and plot. Also fan of the Hitman series by IO software too. Not interested in multiplayer.Impressions: A pleasant surprise indeed. The console port feel doesn't spoil the thrill ride of a hardcore FPS with a strong cinematic leanings. The story is serviceable but it's the characters, their looks and development that surprised me in good ways. There are a lot of unpolished elements with the cover, shooting and AI but the general gameplay is good enough to keep you playing. While the ending was controversial I was OK with it and interested enough to play K&L2.Recommended for: Adults only who don't mind very gritty violence and language. Conclusion: 7/10. Fun, violent, slightly buggy, memorable & short.			"

												Kane & Lynch is certainly a controversial one. Famously responsible for getting Gamespot employee Jeff Gerstman fired, Kane & Lynch has earned a reputation for being a game that whilst being promising given the developer background (I.e Hitman series) ultimately led to dissapointment. However is this lukewarm reception justified? In a way, it sort of is. The story is your standard revenge tale following main leads Kane and Lynch as Kane attempts to get his daughter back from an old gang that wants him dead. Nothing hugely inventive and with no real twists or turns in the plot it remains pretty uninteresting save for the ending which just happens upruptly and really leaves you with a feeling of ""Is that it?"". The most intreguing part of this story are its characters. Whilst Kane and Lynch themselves aren't hugely dimensional, the fact that they are often portrayed as bad people brings a nice, not often explored angle to the entire game. This portrayl lends itself well within the first half of the game with many heist like activites being the main goal, such things as bank heists, nightclub areas and prison breakouts. These areas prove to be where the game shows off the potential it could have had if more love and care went into the entire package.The gameplay itself isn't all that exciting, just your standard third person action shooter affair. However the cover system isn't traditionally placed on a button in Kane & Lynch, instead they opted to make it an automatic cover system so you instantly stick to a wall. This sounds good in theory and for the first half of the game it works ok but it's in the game's second half where it falls apart. The problem is that the system doesn't work half the time leaving you running at the wall like a fool hoping you'll stick to it, this led to a small number of deaths that could have been easily avoided if the cover system was more competant. Also your partner AI is seriously dumb in most instances often getting themselves downed in need of saving because they stood out in enemy fire which again leads to numerous game overs.The game's presentation is sloppy at best; pretty bad lip syncing in game, dialogue interupting other dialogue which causes them to over lap, bland visuals and design. That said however the voicework itself is pretty decent and varies up the locations to at least give some semblance of variety. Overall Kane & Lynch isn't going to set the world on fire or win any awards, however it doesn't totally fail as there is some fun to be had with the servicable shooting. If you see it for sale at around £5 then it's probably worth the 3-4 hours of gameplay, just don't expect it to be all that great.			"

												As the Eidos publicity machine readied itself to push its new shooter, the two lead characters that emerged as the stars of IO Entertainment's gruesome crime caper presented themselves as some of the most irreverent in gaming's history. The pair that make up Kane & Lynch may sound like a duo from a buddy movie where two rule-bending cops save the day, but they are in fact deeply disturbed convicts, broken out of prison by balaclava-clad henchmen, so they may repay a debt to a mysterious crime organisation.You assume the role of Kane; a monstrous killer with a good man trapped inside of him, who has had his wife and child kidnapped while he is serving time, meaning he must jump to the fiddle of a group called The Seven, who will destroy the remnants of his family life without blinking. Kane is consumed by rage and sadness, but has a touch of Max Payne about him. He has almost nothing to lose, and will stop at nothing to get to his wife and daughter, and it's hard not to warm to him even though he is a dangerous killer.Lynch is your side kick; a violent maniac who's psychological profile would likely read like there had been a serious administrative error in a psychiatrist's filing cabinet.He is prone to attacks of intense hallucinations, that usually stir him into a trigger-happy frenzy where innocent bystanders are fair game, and is sent to watch over you as you struggle to return a mysterious bounty to The Seven. With such intriguing and powerful characters it's easy to get swept in by Kane & Lynch: Dead Men, but after several hours of play, it is going to be the gameplay that really matters.In that regard, Dead Men is of mixed success.There are times when the best technique is to charge head on with scant regard for accurate aiming, fighting with fists and shooting from the hip. Then, a moment later you're expected to work your way forward methodically, picking enemies off from quite a distance. While variety is desperately needed in most shooters, here it is too sporadic, and often hopping between the two is rather confusing.There's also the fact that the targeting reticule blends into the background with infuriating ease, and the tendency of weapons to spread their ammunitions means while they are great for close exchanges of fire, missions with an emphasis on ranged shooting can be incredibly annoying. In every game mode snapping on to cover is unreliable, and the basic controls for climbing never seem to work particularly well. For every staggering set piece there is a niggling problem, and it means that while we all wanted Kane & Lynch to be near perfect, it is instead ever so slightly flawed. The visuals are as mixed as the rest of the game. Sometimes stylish and detailed, Kane & Lynch can also come across as rather rough and untidy.If you enjoy games with decent plots, developed characters and decent dialogue, this violent, offensive and witty action game is probably worth your attention, and if you're a shooting game purist, try not to expect too much.

												The game which made a base ground for Payday and Payday 2. It was not bad among other shooters 10 years back, but, after the time passed, it's not worth to actually play it anymore.Let's forget about compatibility issues (GFWL isn't working, but that's no big deal anymore, just a game without achievements and multiplayer). What were the selling points of the game? Intense action? Oh, c'mon there are plenty of games with that, but alot better. Deep, troubling story? Oh, yeah, again, we have plenty of them around, about mass-murdering psychos like Trevor from GTA V, and even ever-drunk baldy Max Payne et cetera, cetera, cetera...So, as a ""pro"" points for the game, everything's compromised. The shooting process itself is bad, the AI is very, very bad, and it's only getting worse (dumber) on the ""Hard"" (""Morphine"") difficulty setting. Even the music (performed by Jasper Kid, if that rings any bells) isn't good and thrilling anymore.All the cool level setups, borrowed from such Michael Mann's movies as ""the Heat"" or ""Collateral"", are no so great - since they were copied too many times, and since they're not original in the first place.The story of betrayal, where betrayed betrays betrayer, and betrayer straighten things up by more betrayals... Well, it sounds stupid, but it still sounds better than it actually is in the game.Note that Kane and Lynch isn't a bad game because it's about bad men. No, it's just a very mediocre shooter, which was lame and secondary-made from the start, and aged very badly. With all those tech troubles... Now it's just doesn't worth the hassle. If you want shootouts - look for GTA great heists, or the Payday 2 - they do all that what was good in the K&L much better.So, my mark is 6/10. Game was worth a one go through in the time it was new. Now, it's better to stay away - unless you have some nostalgia troubles, which I doubt. Try a Youtube walkthrough, maybe? And remember, the shooting, especially aiming, is really bad there.			"

												Game requires seperate download of ""Games for Windows"" client, and creating an account there to even start. The game does not mention this when attempting to start, and will simply fail without error message, giving no clue or indication of what to do. The Games for Windows service is also barely functional, crashing several times merely whilst trying to log in.Upon finally getting the game running, my friend and I discovered that the co-op feature of the game is local split screen only, and REQUIRES both players to use an xbox controler to work at all. Upon attempting single player, the game crashed on me repeatedly.Sadly simply due to waiting more than 14 days before first playing the game, my refund request was denied. It's a pety amount of money, but I just want this scam of a half ♥♥♥♥♥ port off of my Steam list at this point.

												If you are looking for a game that differenciates on any level in the basic cover-based shooters, do not buy Kane & Lynch: Dead Men. Overall, I did not think of it as a bad game, and I did enjoy it a while. But it's short, and repetitive most times. Shoot this, shoot that, rappel here, rappel there. And the story is a typical cliche from one of those action movies who are always the same, story wise. Revenge, revenge, get your family back, they hate you, blablabla.So, basically: want a non-original cover-based shooter that can be fun for a while, and lasts for about 4 hours? Get Kane & Lynch.

												This game is awesome in so many ways. For starters, this isn't your average point and shoot game. This isn't just run and gun and hoorah you saved the planet. No, Kane and Lynch: Dead Men is gritty, dark, with a twisted story and completely mad characters. Kane is kinda calm and smooth talking, but when ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan, man he gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥! Now Lynch... wow, Lynch is just too bananas for the game. At first he'll struck to you as a hippie but oh he so isn't... And when you combine those two shot-out mercenaries against the world: just trust me, you won't regret the story that comes out of it.About the game itself: even though it's a third person shooter, the controls are very fluid, as is the gameplay. When it comes to weapons it's a bit meh: you always start with an assault rifle and the same bloody pistol, but you can trade with Lynch for his shotgun and badass revolver. And hell, you could always pick up a machine gun from a dead guard and just blast everything and everyone because who cares, you're a mercenary! ""But what about ammo?"", you may ask. Well, that's covered too: your allies are always carrying ammo for you. Always. Oh, and if you're downed in battle, they'll come up and revive you. And there you go again, shooting everything and everyone.Final veredict: 9/10. It's just that good.EDIT: after installation, you will most likely be unable to open the game: you'll hit play, and nothing. Just go to your SteamApps folder -> Common -> Kane & Lynch: Dead Men -> XLiveRedist and run the setup. There you go, up and running!			"

												I'm not going to pretend that this game is perfect.  Read enough of the other reviews and you will clearly see that people are mixed on this game.  I'm also not going to touch on the review scandal.  That was an ugly bit of business, but it doesn't impact the game on its own merits.  It showcases how scummy the company is that made the game.  I like the characters overall.  The gang of mercs that you build up has their own personalities and each one adds to the story a little bit, but the center is on Kane and Lynch.  The banter between these 2 during the course of a mission can be a lot of fun to listen to and it helps drive the story a little bit further.  Games like this usually don't have much of a story to them, but this one has little pockets waiting to be seen, if you give it a chance.  It's not without issues, though.  The cover system, while functional at times, does not always work and sometimes you will snap into cover at odd angles or stupid moments and it won't work when you always need it to.  Gunfire definitely drives your aim skyward, but that is a relaistic idea (even if it seems too aggressive in this game).  Enemies do take a fair number of hits to put them down, but if you're in that much of a bad situation, you can always switch to your pistol and go for headshots.  The music and sound effects are great and, again, the banter between the characters will keep things moving.  Sure, profanity abounds in this, but given the source material, what did you expect?  Overall, a mix of locations (and the club shows how many people you can put on a screen at one time... nice chaotic atmosphere that makes it harder to get by without killing any innocents) keeps things interesting and varied.  There aren't too many guns, but there are enough to get the job done and give you a little freedom to determine what works best for you.Is it perfect?  Hell no.  Will you get frustrated with the things that don't work well?  Quite possibly.  But is it worth giving it a try to enjoy what does work?  Yes, I think it is.			"

I'm so sick of you and your fu**ing rules! Lynch, do this, Lynch do that, Lynch stop murdering the hostages!Kane & Lynch: Dead Men is a game that a lot of people will play through and enjoy just because of a well-executed plot and characters (believe me or not, there are few games typically ""for men"" with the real tough guys in the lead role, even fewer titles, where those tough guys have some personal experiences, memories, sadness, moments of joy, in a word - feelings). However, some might find the gameplay not very innovative to the rest of the gaming world but why anyone would bother.  Frustration should never enter into a game because of the mechanics, but with Kane & Lynch it does. Loose gameplay, a short campaign, and a single (good one though) online mode with four maps hurt this title that could have been so much more. In a certain sense, wasted potential. The game is very good, but hasn't avoided a few flaws.			"

												Good game, love the story, the characters, the mechanics, the situations they get in, even the bank job multiplayer that is dead nowadays. Certainly the game has bugs, silly AI and other little annoyances, but overall this is a good game and it's worth all 3€ it costs (now that it's on sale).			"

												Prior to my purchase of Kane & Lynch: Dead Men, I had read, heard, and seen entirely mixed reviews on it. I'd been hesitant to buy it for this reason, however having now picked it up during a sale (a whopping $1.75) I was able to try it out. Having ran through the surprisingly short campaign (it took me four hours to complete, all within a single sitting, on the highest difficulty setting), I know understand why the game was so ill recieved by some. K&L:DM is a bog standard cover based third-person shooter in its gameplay, and that gameplay is subpar at best. Most weapons I found to be completely inaccurate at anything beyond short range, enemies were basically bullet sponges (however this may be attributed to the difficulty I was playing on), the movement was clunky, and attempting to get behind cover often resulted in either awkwardly walking against a wall, or sticking to cover that you didn't mean to stick to. Your AI teammates also seemed to be pretty dim as well. This, at points, lead to very frustrating moments, and many undeserved deaths. It's still functional, but it isn't sharp by any means. Where the game does shine however is in its narrative and atmosphere. The entire game felt grimey, from the characters to the enviroment and even the soundtrack. It nailed the ""criminal"" feeling quite well. The story was also quite good, although nothing I haven't seen before. Interesting (if a bit shallow) characters, and funny dialogue with more cuss words than a bar full of sailors propelled it forward. If you're willing to slog through the sketchy mechanics, then there's a good afternoons time to be had with this game. Though do as I did, and pick it up on sale. For cheap, I'd definitely recommend it.			"

												Overall, a relatively fun local co-op game to play at home with a friend. Kane and Lynch: Dead Men is a 3rd person shooter, with a reasonable plot with some interesting locations and scenarios such as robbing a bank, breaking people out of prison. However gameplay had a turn for the worse when they went to Havana onwards, where you suddenly turned into some army commando fighting against armies of soldiers. I only played on local co-op on game pads, so i'll be reviewing based on the gameplay i experienced. I'd only recommend buying it if extremely cheap on offer, especially if you are looking for something to play with a friend at home. Options are relatively limited for couch co-op play at the moment, so this option gives this game a good plus point.Pros:+ Reasonable story line+ Kane and Lynch make great main characters for the game+ Some nice scenarios+ Multiple endings+ Local Couch Co-op+ Gamepad supportCons:- Uses Games for Windows Live, which means you have to create an X-Box Live profile and install another bit of software. Takes a little bit of time to set up.- Quite a short campaign.- Awful AI in enemies and your squad of men that follow you. Came across one situation where we couldn't get through to the next access point in Havana because one of our men had decided to get on a fixed gun despite all enemies being dead. There was a generic army guy following us in his place. Trying to get him to come with us was annoying because he kept jumping back on the gun as soon as we got him out of it.- Enemies have ridiculosly good aim from far away and don't suffer from any recoil.- Poor gamepad controls: looking is way too unsensitive even when on maximum settings, Lynch's gamepad settings always changed to the default again every time you started the game.- Some game controls you almost never end up using, such as passing eachother weapons, or giving orders to your squad, but that could be down to the very short campign however.- Awful automatic wall cover system, which rarely ever works, and when it does it happens when you don't want it to.- Bullets and grenades clipping off air when you try to shoot or throw them near a corner of a wall. Throwing grenades while in cover can be disastrous.- Grenades are pretty crap in general.- Lynch in the side of the car in one of later missions has almost zero range to shoot anything. In the same mission, there are enemies that can be driving and shooting you from behind, but no one can turn around to shoot at them.- All achievements are for Games for Windows Live, and non existant on Steam.My Score: 6/10			"

Kane and Lynch: Dead Men have everything I like in a shooter, except for the bad AI, DRM and only local co-op. But these are just the bad aspects of this amazing game, Kane and Lynch are much more as a duo!Kane is a man on the death row, but the sins of his past wouldn't let him die just like that, no. He had to suffer, so it starts. Meting Lynch sure shake things up, a psychopath heavenly inspired by Waingro, a character in the movie Heat. This fantastic duo sets foot on a path fueled by revenge and the uncontrollable need to fix Kane's family, her ex-wife and daughter kidnapped by The 7, a group of top worldwide gangsters.This is the starting line; travel the world hunting down The 7, and shooting mobs of enemies.No doubt a huge hit by IO Interactive, a cover-based shooter with intense violence and major Holywood influences like Heat.Although we only play as Kane, Lynch is definitely still there, together with some friends we pick up on the line. As an action game every level is priceless, from the start bank heist, to the prison breakout, or even the very famous night club shootout in Japan. Each moment in this game is amazing, the level design always makes me go back and replay it.The stressful situations, Lynch looses it, the innocent people screaming... Such great free violence only video-games can provide! The gameplay quality, however, makes me feel sad this had to be an issue... For starters the AI is terrible, and we're talking about some big issues here; enemies stop in the middle of the fight, your teammates without a clue where to go, the hitboxes are a huge mess...If this was not bad enough, the physics have issues too. Throwing a grenade can be challenging, you never know where they go by hitting an invisible wall or just crazy physics blocking their way.Although we shoot most of the time, the hitboxes are the biggest issue for me, and make it almost impossible to hit enemies at some distances.Being a console port doesn't help much either, the visual and performance options are there, but seem to make little difference in improvements!From all the negative feedback, the DRM is probably the main reason, choosing GFWL wasn't a good idea in the long run plan, but the game still works (surprisingly).I tend to forget about all of this when I'm playing Kane and Lynch: Dead Men, with such good maps, and a story line worth of a TV Show, every problem gets swelling down, almost like every pill Lynch takes.The soundtrack is worth a being checked out, and suits perfectly with the tension of the campaign. Co-Op action is still available, but local only, and that's a shame because the game does offer some great co-op moments!I give Kane and Lynch: Dead Men a positive review, but barely... Because the campaign is really good, and the story is so solid, it makes me go back and replay some amazing missions, even though they all play out the same way!There is nothing more powerful than a father seeking revenge!6/10			"

												If you’re a fan of Michael Manns films, then rest assured, you’re going to enjoy Kane & Lynch: Dead Men. From the L.A Bank heist shootout to the Nightclub showdown, you’ll have a vague idea what rests ahead.Visually, the Hitman: Blood Money game engine has dated well. And holds up to many games this current generation with well-rounded reflections, shadows and environmental destruction which add a sense of realism and immersion into the game world. Cut scenes suffer from audio cutting out resulting in the end of the conversations missing, while the addition of sub-titles makes this issue smaller, the end result is a still mildly frustrating. As for the voice acting, Lynch leaves something to be desired but the voice acting for Kane adds much more to the character of this flawed man.Mechanically, while it works, the cover system is “clunky” at best; resulting in poor cover mechanic and a sub-par targeting system with precision targeting is almost non-existent in the game.Gameplay-wise, Kane & Lynch is a kinetic and non-stop experience, shooting and seeking cover is exiting whenever you can control it. Although it can get repetitive at times, there’s no stop sign to show at you by the constant number of henchmen coming at you. The command system that plays out in a strategic way where you can command your team mates/NPC’s to target selected enemies or take cover; however it was an under-exploited system because you will find yourself doing all the shooting due to the poor AI.Kane & Lynch is a thrilling but very violent and masochistic action game. You have the opportunity to end the lives of innocent bystanders to even hearing the voice of a cop beg for their life because they have children; all while the wife and daughter of Kane are held captive. The story follows at a psychological drama emotional vibe, and certain strong elements that would put the player in enough stress if it isn't by the story's way of destroying up the characters’ lives, and although it doesn't grab enough interest on its character development it does at least satisfy you with those individual personalities of each that makes a credible duo that are not precisely role models nor does it glamourize the lifestyle of the protagonist which many games or movies lean towards to justify their actions.Exciting, ultra-violent, masochistic guilt, pulse pounding vengeance, searing vulgarity and Japanese gangsters in leather motorcycle outfits, this game has every top-notch action film element one could ask for.

												*Insert the cliché ""I wish there was a neutral option"" sentence*With some more polish, this game could've been a classicBasically everything that isn't directly related to gameplay is pretty much great. The story is awesome and gritty, the characters are fleshed out, the voice acting is very good and the graphics still hold up today. The game is amazingly varied, which something that most games don't really have. I'll be now giving some SPOILERS, so be careful.You get to escape from prison, you get to break into a prison, you get to rob a bank and so on.But now the negatives...While the bullets exist from a realistic point, a.k.a. the gun, the aiming system isn't really configured to that fact and it still seems to think that bullets come from a straight line in the middle of the screen. That will be an issue when behind cover and shooting a sniper rifle.Speaking of cover, the cover system is junk. And seeing as it's a 3rd person cover shooter, it's pretty damn pathetic to see this excuse of a ""cover system"" being implemented. It's an auto-snap cover system. So that means, no designated button and no real indicators to show which covers can actually be used. Also, once behind the cover, make sure you barely move. Otherwise you'll most likely walk away from the cover again and you might never get back to it.The gunplay is pretty awful in terms of it feeling satisfying. You can shoot some enemies 4 times in the face without them even being fazed. There's no real feedback there.The guns are very random in terms of their stats. The accuracy is the same on all of them. That meaning, the accuracy sucks for all of them. The game has a physical recoil mechanic, meaning that when shooting up, the camera also jerks up. Well, putting that in made them forget that an M16 should have a good chance at hitting a target at medium range when single firing. Well, there's no actual difference between spraying/burst or single firing. Only you deciding whether you can deal with the recoil jerks.Overall:Objectively this game is a 3/10. It's easy to see the glaring issues and it's way below average.Subjectively, I enjoyed this game enough to finish the 4-hour campaign. Subjective grade: 5/10 - Just average.(All games start at a 5/10 and move up and down based on their pros and cons)			"

												Very fun game with some great characters.  The game is an action shooter but whats fun is some levels enemies just keep spawning for no reason.  Like the diner level where you are escaping, and cops keep spawning, you can gun them down for eternity to vent that parking ticket rage or just for kicks.  The graphics are impressive for a dated title, with solid controls.  Many times I have played this game, yet still go back playing it again.  Being a fast paced game, it never feels to worn out.

												An entertaining shooter that is much, much better than its horrendous sequel, Dog Days. It is a cover based, coop TPS game with two very angry protagonists. Firefights are tense and fun and the places where they take place are varied. I believe when it came out (2007) it was probably the only shooter utilising a cover-based gameplay. Also, there is a nightclub scene where there are dozens of civilians around you without the FPS rate dropping. I remember it being rather new and fascinating at the time the game was advertised.I think Dead Men aged well and can still be entertaining today. Just make sure you have a friend to play with as its campaign is rather short so you can give it a try with a friend if needed and of course it should only be picked up if further discounted.			"

												This is a brilliant and widely under rated gem! Highly enjoyable and alot of fun if you like big tactical shootouts and throwing grenades at people. I remember first playing this on PS3 and I don't think I ever appreciated just how much of a masterpiece it is. It is a must play and essential to experience on PC.I read some strange reviews here making bizzare claims about the gameplay and mechanics that I found to be false. It is actually very impressive (especially for it's time) I really enjoyed battling through the various settings while commanding my soldiers to make the best approaches.. some parts are challenging, but in a good, not impossible way, and should be appreciated. I guess there is alot of players that just don't have the skill or concentration to rise to the challenge but those that do can really get into this and enjoy it. While a bit old now, it is a unique game with a cool style, amazing levels, dramatic story and entertaining characters which make it a work of art that I highly reccomend to play on PC. (my specs are weak but still runs great) (K&L 2 however, I prefer to play on PS3, it is quite different but also awesome)hoping they make Kane & Lynch 3 one day10/10  "

												Kind of spoilers ahead.Damned if you do, damned if you don't.This is Kane and Lynch: Dead Men.From the get go, i enjoyed how it began, secretive order of mercenaries and Kane being the traitor and all that.I was immediately surprised by how the game looked. It was beautiful, the character models looked very polished and shooting them was very satisfying (the ragdolling in this game is pretty funny as they fall into a boneless heap when you kill them.)I liked how your crew could revive you with a shot of adrenaline but made it so that you couldn't rely on it as you could overdose and die from it anyway. It makes you careful about your gameplay but doesn't take away from how you can enjoy the game itself.I disliked how the AI in the game (either the enemies or your crew) can get either super smart or super dumb while you play through the game. I've encountered several moments where the enemy's gun would glitch through the wall and kill me and sometimes i'd be standing in-front of them and they would still not take notice. Hilarious and frustrating at the same time. The plot was very engaging to me and i really felt for Kane as he struggled throughout the game but the ending left me thinking..there was a decision but which decision was the canon ending?It didn't take me too long to finish the campaign, i was hoping it would be a tad bit longer. I was hooked on the story, i wanted more of Kane and Lynch.Oh and if you can get past your hate of GFWL, then you can enjoy the singleplayer (maybe even the Co-op if you are lucky.) campaign cause multiplayer seems pretty damn dead.7/10 would play again after GFWL gets patched out			"

												I'm going to use the dreaded word ""underrated"" to describe this game, because it is. It's 1:25am, I've just finished the game, and it does NOT deserve the hatred it got. Graphics: 8/10For 2007, I really can't fault it, the graphical settings are nothing special and the hair looks a little silly, but it's competent.Style: 7/10I'd give this a higher score but the awesome style is not used enough. For instance, a certain character dies and the screen goes into a frenzy as the protagonist does, but this only happens ONCE. Too much good stuff underused.Story: 10/10Here is where it shines. Kane and Lynch are possibly the most abhorrent, frustrating, aggressive and irresponsible protagonists in a game, yet I wanted them to succeed, I pushed for them to be better people and that's what emotionally affects you. These people are irredeemable, and they are in denial, and so are you. The story is a little cliche at times, but it touched my small, bullet-riddled heart, and I loved it, I forgive the game for all of it's flaws just for this and the characters. Although, it shouldn't really be called 'Kane & Lynch'. 'Kane & Friends' is more accurate.Gameplay: 5/10Here we go... The AI is frustrating, the gun mechanics are clunky and sometimes unresponsive, there are clipping issues galore and some enemies are too infuriating, even on easy, that's not being bad at gaming, that's developers screwing you over.HOWEVER, this game is worth playing through to the end for the story and, while it may be an unpopular opinion, this game is great. Now I'm off to play K&L2, ta-ta!			"

												This game is pure rubbish. There is no other way to describe it. The controls are terrible. For example. Reload, pick up weapon, action, climb something all mapped to one button, and there is no button to take cover, which is kinda important in a cover based shooter, especially when there is a heap of snipers (like there is in KAL:DM). The shooting just feels off. The crosshair gives no indication where the bullets are going to go, so no long range headshots. I understand guns aren't laser beams but when you character can't hit the broad side of a barn with his assault rifle, you know somethings off. They also lack a feeling of impact or power. They sound like toys. The only weapons that feel somewhat good to use are the AK and the SIG 552. The story is just silly. You'll jump from location to location without any expliantion, and characters are thrown in with no introduction. Kane continues to trust Lynch even though he is a pyshcopath with no real skills and  ruins two missions early on by killing hostages . You'll murder half the police force in LA and Tokyo and be able to escape by catching a ride on a train or a van, even though you weren't wearing masks or anything. You'll attempt to sneak out of a building having just shot everyone inside (granted, you don't get away with it and need to murder every cop in sight. )  I mean I know it's a video game but it's just too silly to take seriously, which is the developer's intention. And then there's the actual missions. Each one leads to a dumb shoot out. Sneaking between outposts in a war-torn country? Don't sweat it, just have a shoot out. Bank robbery? Just shoot everything, including the cops. Night club kidnapping? Guess what, you'll just shoot everything that moves! Everything is just a gunfight. A gun fight with bad controls and idiot team mates that you need to keep alive. There are missions that imply the developers were going to have stealth, or something interesting, but nope, just shoot the cops/gangsters/brown people and go to point A to B.  This game's only redeeming feature is the fact that the concept is somewhat interesting. I mean having two guys who will just use people to get what they want is admittedly somewhat interesting, but in no way will carry this game.			"

Both of them are unique in its own way.Kane & Lynch Dead Men is 3rd person shooter game with Awesome storyline, nice graphics, Really cool maps, and Psychopatic characters.

I wouldn't say its slow moving. Its action packed, fast paced 3rd person shooter. Its not easy but its not super hard. Would reccomend this to people who played the GTA series like myself.

												I loved this game on Xbox 360 and couldn't pass it up on PC during a recent SquareEnix sale.  Simply does not work for me.  Plagued with framerate issues that seem to have no solution.

I've got way more than enough specs to run this with room to spare.It might be cheap on sale, but if it doesn't work, then you've wasted your money.

However, characters' face, movement, gun reloading action are all wonderful. You can actually see the detail of them.These are not easy to make at that time. While playing it, i enjoy it.

												Kane & Lynch: Dead Men is the single most under rated thrid person shooter. Period. It tries to be Ghost Recon meets GTA, but it ends up being something completely original. You don't play Kane & Lynch for the shooting and buggy as hell cover system; Gears of War does it a thousand times better. You don't play Kane & Lynch for some  mind-bending tactics; it ends up being more run n' gun than anything else. What you do play Kane & Lynch for is the story, strangely enough. The protagonists are a sociopath trying to save his family and a drug addict who slips in and out of uncontrollable mania. Sound interesting? That's because it is. The characters are where the game shines, but the plot is better than, well, any shooter I can think of. It may be a subpar game, but Kane & Lynch: Dead Men is one hell of a story.			"

												A flawed but strangely enjoyable game. Follow a ruthless ex mercenary who's family has been held hostage by a mysterious group known as ""The 7"" and a medicated psychopath who is prone to blacking out and going on murderous rampages. A crazy series of missions from bank heists, hitting up clubs in Shanghai, to fighting in a South American civil war - the story is over the top, such as rapelling down an office building to blow up the window and fight your way to the bottom, and the characters pull the story together just enough that you'll be happy to follow along. The weakest point in the game is the combat, and lacklustre gameplay mechanics. Shooting is mediocre and hard when your shots don't hit their mark (usually making you rely on a lucky shot or two that hits its mark), the cover system is practically useless and very tough to use, and the ability to command your fellow criminals doesn't have enough of an impact to be worth doing since they can often take care of themselves.Regardless, this game oddly captured my interest and held onto me for the span of its short, couple hour campaign.

												It's like a low budget B-Movie. Hate it or love it.Top Cons:- AI at most times is like a r3tarded creature with heavy myopia, which reacts and attacks only to touching - when bullets penetrate it- and when you are close enough to give it a kiss.- Scripted moves, like nothing happens if you don't go to the right coordinates with all of your crew members etc.- Windows Live account required and achievements are also stored there.- Some settings like V-Sync, even if you switch them off and save, the next time you start the game, they will be enabled again. Cons- Default key bindings are weird. Like for Reload, the default key is E or for Walking is Shift etc. - Crew members sometimes don't follow you and as a result you have to wait for them to come when you change scene and is required to have all of them near you. Or they get killed because you left them behind.Pros- I liked the story plot. - I liked the characters. True badasses with psychological issues.- Nice graphics. (Note that this is a 2007 game)- Nice movie scenes.- Various enviroments and missions. From prison breaks and assassinations to civil wars. What the flying ♥♥♥♥.- It takes a few hours to complete it. It's good and bad. Good because you can't stand all these cons. Bad because it has nice story (if you think of it like a low budged movie  with a little or no sense as i said)Well after all i still like it, It has personality.			"

												The game is...ok? Kane and Lynch: Dead Men isn't exactly a gem of a game, and the gameplay is quite mediocre. Most guns have terrible accuracy, and the enemys were somewhat difficult, but dumb as well, since they just rush most of the time. But what it lacks in gameplay, it makes up quite well in story. The game looks pretty bad, but realize, it's from 2007, and wasn't exactly a big project from Eidos, just a few guys got together and made it. The story feels like, as others have said, like a Tarantino film. The characters are intresting, and hits the crime feel pretty damn well. Only part that weirded me out was towards the end of the game, which I do not want to spoil. It's one of those games where ""It's not bad, but not great either."" Just depends on how you view the game yourself. When it's on sale, I recommend picking up a copy, but don't go anywhere near that thing they call a sequel and a port to PC called Kane And Lynch 2: Dog Days. If you can sit through some boring Cover-N-Shoot gameplay, then you can get a pretty good story.			"

It's who they are; they're the bad guys. They are bad men who have done incredibly bad things.

The voice acting is spectacular, the graphics are very good, and the story is not bad, if not just for the ending that just kinda came out of left field.

												This game is a general shooter with bad story and really dumb AI, however there is something about this game that makes it fun. At least through the first playthrough. When the game was released it had really good graphics, now they fall short. The game limits the amount of weapons to 5, which is extreamly frustrating. There is the pistol, two types of sub machine guns, shotgun and a rocket lanucher. Each scene of the game is packed with action and lots of chaos with tons of dumb enemies running at you. The game is really short too. It can be completed in less than 5 houers from start to finish. While IO Interactive delivered excellent Hitman games, here they fell short on everything. The story, the AI and the level design. Plus some frustrating unexpected instant deaths like those from a missile shot or sniper.Also the Multiplayer for this game is dead. Since GFWL is dead one can't play multiplayer games anymore.You will have fun with this one on the first playthrough but there is absolutly no replay value.I'll recommend this game due to the entretainment on playing it once.65/100Good:- Lots of enemies and chaos- The particle effects and destructable enviromentsBad:- Aweful AI- Bad level design- Weapons feel bad and have no weigh- Too short- No replay value			"

												Bad porting completely holds this game back. Aside from the fact that you MUST download Games for Windows Marketplace to even run the game, the game on my computer and multiple other users runs at a low fps even when on low settings as well as FPS stutters. Although I ran this on my laptop which has an integrated gpu, I've found this to be an issue that is not directly related to hardware. I just bought it on a steam sale going for $1.74 as well but even at that low of a price I still requested a refund because a bad port is not worth my time nor money no matter how low the cost. *And yes I am aware that there is a possible [keyword here] low fps/stutter fix, but having to disable HID-compliant consumer devices just to fix the FPS for a 2007 game after downloading Games for Windows Live and dealing with that and inputting a CD key [that didn't work] was just the straw that broke the camel's back for me and frankly speaking is just not worth it for a game I paid $1.74 for. If I really want to experience it, I'll get it on 360, this just isn't worth it.			"

												I enjoyed Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days a lot, and bought the first game a few years after that.I must say, I enjoyed the first game too, but I think that it's too short, and quite annoying at some places. The AI companions can't take cover properly, and they can't revive each other if they are downed - you must revive them yourself.There's no reload button, the character reloads automatically. Which means, that sometimes he starts reloading when you are just about to jump out of cover to shoot. Or, he won't start reloading and you jump on enemies from behind with almost empty mag.Cover system is similar to Mass Effect 1 - when you approach an obstacle, the character will take cover automatically.I've only had slight problems with this, and that the camera angles from cover are very badly synced with your aim. Most of the time when I peak out of cover, the shots are hitting the wall which I was taking cover at.Atmosphere is good, the game has the exact feel - dark, criminal, unfortunate. I don't like Kane, he's both uninteresting and makes wrong decisions. Also constantly refuses Lynch's suggestions, then he pays for it.Had no technical problems, apart from wrong installation - I had to manually go to game's folder and install GFWL support. It also constantly ran at 60+ FPS on max details. The graphics are avarage, enviroments sometimes feel empty. Characters look good though.Fortunately, you don't need to login to GFWL to play the game, so the presence of GFWL has no effect. Don't be afraid of it.Overall, it's a good game, but I don't recommend it because of auto-reloading and auto-cover systems that can cause trouble. Also it's very short (4 hours), companions are dumb at certain situations, and Kane is annoying character.The Kane and Lynch 2 is a great though, it pretty much gets rid of EVERY negative points I mentioned in this review for Kane and Lynch 1. I recommend checking the second game.			"

												On one hand you have Kane. He's calm, collected, has his stuff in order, but nothing ever seems to go his way. On the other hand, you have Lynch. He's psychotic and prone to being a complete screw-up, but at least he's consistent. This dynamic duo is out to do what they do best, kill a ton of people, and...and...and? There's a plot to this madness, but expect it to kinda fall by the wayside after the first hour and a half. It's clear to me that IO interactive had some great ideas, but they forgot to put it all together for most of the game. There's a prison bus escape, then some shoot-outs, there's a robbery, and then some more shoot-outs. The rest of the game takes place in Havana and Venezuela, and it plays out like every other 3rd person War game. To add to this, the PC port of this game is a bit crap. It's prone to glitches, poor graphic effects, and objects disappearing whenever they feel like it. I honestly thought they added to the game. It made for a very surreal atmosphere. It's possible that I don't find the game nearly as appealing as the characters. A lot of the time with these 3rd person shooters, you have Nathan ""Indy"" Drake, Lara ""Rambo"" Croft, the men (and women) of Gears of War, and so on. These heroes are made to be charismatic, given aspects that people can relate to, and are basically good people caught in bad situations. I mean okay, I can buy it sometimes, but the idea of playing as a couple horrible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who make bad situations even worse? That's so cool. Would they be better off dead? Most definitely. However, I get the feeling that Hell wouldn't be an acceptable end for them. Hell is more like....stage 3. Somehow they shoot their way out, but manage to end up somewhere else, and shoot that place up as well. Along the way there would be a failed string of negotiations, heists, kidnappings, liberations, bar mitzvahs, and house parties. As a shooter, Dead Men is merely competent. Aside from the odd difficulty spike or two towards the end and some primo snipers, most gamers will sleepwalk through the chaos. Mostly this game gets by on some neats moments, its engaging protagonists, and some really decent sound-direction(good music). If you're curious and don't mind putting up with more issues than Sports Illustrated, give this game a go. During sales it tends to cost about as much as a candy bar, and lasts slightly longer. "

												This game runs like total ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ on new hardware. Seriously, why is it everytime you play a game that's somewhat old there's a 50/50 chance it won't run well? I just bought the entire Thief series for $12 and added in Kane & Lynch Dead Men on my shopping list, it was a dollar so I said ""Hey, why the hell not?"". I was always curious to try out a Kane & Lynch game, but too bad It's an unoptimized piece of ♥♥♥♥. I literally only clocked in 12 minutes, because it's unplayable, UN-♥♥♥♥IN-PLAYABLE! To anyone who has new hardware I don't buy this, unless someone has found a way to counter act this. Otherwise, just buy it on 360 at your local bargin bin.			"

												I started out with part 2 of this series (Dog Days) and found it to be an awesome game. Part 2 had COOP with internet as this one only has local COOP. So after I played part 2 I was in need for some more action. I loaded part 1 (this one) and thought it would look outdated and buggy. Well, to my surprise it was just as good! The story was great, and the action was great. Highly recommand this and the 2nd to anyone who likes a good story and action.			"

												All in all, a barely average game. It has its moments, but the bland gameplay is what holds it back. K&L's story was the only thing keeping me hooked and is where the game truly shines. The gritty criminal underworld atmosphere, the diverse characters with layers and flaws, and the pursuit of vengeance make for a great tale. It all feels like a mindless action movie at times, which is fun. Kane and Lynch's conflicting personalities and little quips make for a good laugh as well. The plot is actually pretty dark, which I enjoyed immensely. Had playing the actual game not been so tedious, I'd agree that this is an underrated title.But this is where the game fell flat. The cover-based third person shooting isn't special in any way, and gets old fast. Sure, it's a short game (3.5 hours for me on normal with more than a couple of deaths), but the shooting doesn't feel invigorating enough to excite me. It all felt like a chore. There are some challenging stealth portions, which made for nice breaks, but they were few and far between. Granted, I did play this title solo. Maybe co-op is more fun, but I can't say as I didn't feel interested enough to try it. It's not an expensive game, and is dirt cheap especially on sale. If you're on the fence and like these types of shooters or are in the mood for a good tale, I'd say give it a try. It's certainly not a broken or terrible game, and I had some fun with it. Maybe you'll like it more than I did.To sum it all up: Good story, bad gameplay			"

												The game's single player campaign is rather small (5.5 hours at medium difficulty level for me), but it's more fun than e.g. both of Rainbow Six: Vegas games. Its story is good especially when comparing to any of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon or Rainbow Six.I had the only problem with the game - it simply didn't start after I pressed Play button in the K&L: Dead Men CD Key dialog box (Windows Vista Ultimate 64, nothing fancy). The problem was solved by manually installing Games for Windows LIVE from downloads.microsoft.com. The game plays fine without creating online Microsoft LIVE account - I just press ESC, then SPACE and it starts. I strongly suggest Valve to include this in the game's FAQ (same problem with K&L2: Dog Days BTW).			"

												So for me it's a yes. Is it a life changing game? Well, obviously no. Was it fun to play? Yes, specially since (at least in normal) the game was not too difficult and not too long either. So it's just kind of like watching a 5 hour long movie. The mechanics of the game were not amazing and the graphics are clearly outdated, but I found no bugs whatsoever. I must mention, however, that the gameplay is far from perfect and that it has a lot to improve on.Regarding the characters and the story, well, I'd say they do their jobs. Just don't expect too much, and you may actually like them. The story wasn't boring and, in the end, I kind of cared for what had happened to one of the characters enough to google it, so yeah...Both main characters are pretty much two criminal pyschopaths, and although that put me off a little, I'll admit the game was not that bad. I am just glad to know that these are just fictional characters, thank Lord Gaben. Anyway, as a positive last aspect of the game, I gotta say that the fact that you just don't die, but fall to the ground while seeing ""the light"" and hearing ""voices from your past"" is a great, great addition. So, instead of automatically realoading after getting shot too much, like in most games, you just fall inconscious, almost dead, until one of your mates revive you with an adreline shot. I loved it! It brings continuity to the gameplay and the story. I really liked it.And as final thought, I'd like to say that I hated the fact that you've always got to rappel everywhere. I think the devs were really proud of figuring out how to include that in the game, and then decided to use it in all levels, even if it sometimes brought nothing to the story and felt rather forced.

												I got this and the second game reeeeeaaaaaal cheap, like £1 for both games, so yeah bargain, i don't regret the 50p spent on this game but it is...mediocre at best. The gameplay is really janky and a lot of the time when you shoot someone when they are behind cover your bullet won't hit them and just goes through them instead, causing you to either wait for them to move or you being forced to move into different cover to take them out. There's a nice assortment of different environments and levels to play through including a prison, bank, a nightclub, the streets of japan and even some jungle levels late on in the game. I have to say actually that the nightclub level in this is probably the best nightclub i have seen in a game so far, it had really immersive strobe lighting and was packed with 100's of NPC's who then run around screaming when you inevitably have a shootout in it. Compare this to the clubs in games like Deus ex or Sleeping Dogs and there's no comparison, and this game came out in 2007 so that's impressive to me. Only the new Hitman game and the new Assassins Creed Unity has really played around with interactive crowd density.It's weird though because the actual story about Kane and Lynch has had no effort put into it BUT the actual characters all have more personality than you would expect in a game like this and i found the voice acting really well done as well, i actually wanted to finish the game to see where the story went. It's just why and how Kane and Lynch continue to work with each other had me saying WTF!!!! Lynch is a psychopath who kills innocent people for no reason and then has a blackout where he doesn't even remember doing it. Later on in the game Kane has him keep his ex japanese girlfriend hostage, and without spoiling it you can tell that isn't going to end well. If they were brothers i could understand it but they just met each other and another character who you break out of prison even says he doesn't wanna work with Lynch because he's a crazy b*stard and killed his own wife. They have a character in the game who gets it! so why doesn't Kane? it's stupid and they could have made that way more believable if they just spent more time on the writingI would actually recommend this game purely for the nightclub level, the rest of the game is ok if you can get past some of the jank.

												As much as I had SOME fun playing this, it was also a pretty weak game. Shooting with the guns are pretty hit or miss, no really, either you miss the target by a mile or you hit them and it's not like it's consistent either.I'm sure the graphics were good back in 2007 but it is pretty dated by now. The voices are somewhat weird, sometimes they're kinda good, next they sound very much out of place and not very good acted. Also, the weapon sounds are not that good.The story was very much forgetable. Kane owes The7 something but his family gets dragged in to his affairs instead... and it shifts from the ""get this suitcase!"" to the ""find Kanes daughter and make sure she's secure!"" kind of objective. It will be forgotten before this day is over, I'm afraid.I think the only reason I kept playing this was because I know the sequel - ""Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days"" - is better. At least I remember it being better... hm, that'll be up next. Oh, if you can get this for a really cheap price, then it could be some hours worth of fun, just saying.			"

												I'll say this is pretty much the headshot game... mostly because you get to the point where you have to shoot the enemies in the head, or you're wasting a small bit of ammo on each enemy. The story is ok, but at times doesn't make sense the decisions made, often without your input. It's very much like: ""oh this happened, get sent here, shoot everyone, then get to extraction point without dying, and beam up to next area."" Not a bad game all around, just not a really good game that I would be playing a great deal of. Beat it the first or second day that I played it, mediocre replay value. On a side note, if you find semi-psychotic co-actors and such wacky type, unexpected foolery very amusing, with some shooting and fast mouse movement to avoid getting flanked a challenge and revel in it, then this game is great for you. If you are looking for a story rich, 1st/3rd person shooter with great graphics where everything has it's place and serves the greater purpose of enlightening your game time, maybe look elsewhere first... if all the deep desires are sated, go for it, but i'd really only recommend it on sale.

												Quick Summary: Play an anti-hero like a poor man’s Max Payne in a third person shooter with a gritty semi-realistic storyline.  The game appears to have co-op functionality, but I don’t think you can go through the single player campaign with a friend. Also, the game uses Games for Windows Live.You play the campaign as Kane, a former mercenary indebted to a powerful crime group with international dealings. By indebted, I mean they own you and will kill your family if you don’t pay them back what you owe. The group has tasked Lynch, a low level thug as your new partner, and he’ll be tagging along with you to make sure you behave. Unfortunately Lynch has some serious problems, which add considerably to your own situation. The game is played as a third person shooter where you can pick up the weapons your fallen enemies drop, and/or request ammo from one of your allies (usually Lynch). There are maybe a dozen guns to choose from but some are noticeably better than others (stronger, more precise).  There’s even a rocket launcher on a few levels to take care of tanks/helicopters. An important distinction is that unlike the Max Payne games, you have a “regenerating health” system instead of a standard health bar. This means if you take damage, you just have to hide for a few seconds and you’ll fully recover. This of course means the game is faster paced and you’re going to be more likely to try daring Rambo style attacks or charge enemy positions.Pros:+I mentioned the gritty storyline, and I actually enjoyed it. The “hero” Kane makes all sorts of stupid but believable decisions, and his new partner Lynch is even dumber. There are no “good guys” in this game, as is probably the case among real world criminal thugs.+This is straightforward action, no puzzle solving or map exploring. You won’t get “lost” while playing this game, which I appreciate when I want to just blast my way through a mediocre game in one afternoon.Cons:-The game’s graphics are lackluster for something less than 10 years old, and the gameplay can be kind of clunky. I am told that if you have Windows 10, you will not be able to adequately run this game.-I mentioned blasting my way through the game in one afternoon, and by that I mean the game is like 5 hours long. Hope you got it for a cheap price because there really isn’t that much replay value.Overall, I don’t regret playing the game, but I’m glad I got it from a Humble Bundle because there’s nothing about it that’s “awesome.” Not horrible either though. 6.5/10 "

												IO Interative take on crime action drama with psychopatic and brutal protagonists. Gameplay is satisfying enough, antiheroes are the real deal and it is worth to see how f****d up they can behave. Worth giving a shot for those who enjoy good 3rd person action (with nothing else but action, no additional features). Screw that construction truck boss, I played that part 20 times until I got him :D			"

												This game is a perfect example of how to not do it. At all.The story is a blunder at best, any Tom Cruise movie would do.The graphics are subpar, almost ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but the performance is nontheless bad and shaky.Obviously meant to be played with a controller, the mouse controls are as wonky as aiming with the controller, no aim assist, a protagonist unable to fire a gun only slightly steady despite him being some kind of veteran soldier/hitman.Worst parts, however, are:a) mechanics. Protect someone? Dies without any connection to any current event. Get shot through a vehicle? No problem. Can also walk right through it.b) the AI. They're not just stupid, they also don't hit anyone with guns. Pardon, anyone but you.c) quality: you're in a car chase and it's entirely static scripted programming, however the diriver manages to randomly crash the car into the road. Yes, into. He's trying to submerge. Which may or may not also destroy the vehicle, outside of any control you may have over it. Lovely. Also, you may be able to trigger a cutscene you're meant to trigger, but you'll die in the cutscene and will have to restart. Rinse, repeat until the RNG that computes the outcome of a cutscene is in your favor.3/10 for an attempt at grit through his ""psychosis"" which only comes up when you're almost dead and repeats after the second time anyway. The only good thing is the game switches between direct talk and earpiece comms in a somewhat credible fashion.			"

												Spectacularly inept and ill-considered attempt to make a gritty third person shooter. It clearly wanted to pay homage to Michael Mann's crime films and their tales of tortured antiheroes living on the edge, but the writing falls far short of the mark, producing flat caricatures who slaughter their way from one bungled job to the next, gunning down waves of rock-stupid AI enemies while grousing about their luck. The game's director said he was sick of goody two-shoes video game protagonists and wanted to do something different, but it feels like some pretty fundamental lessons of characterization and dialog were lost in translation. Even if you overlook the fatal flaws in the narrative, however, the gameplay is clunky, repetitive, and entirely linear, with swimmy controls and fitful feedback. Maybe it could be chalked up to age if not for the fact that I've played better third person shooters that came out years before this one - and they still hold up even a decade+ on. Skip it and try a Max Payne game instead.			"

												After great expextations this is a big disappointment. I just cannot believe that people who made Hitman made this game. No gore, terrible AI, only the word ""F*CK"" is more frequent than bullets fired... The cover system is broken, you get shot through walls, the crosshair is kinda useless since bullets go another direction every time you fire. When I was buying I expected blood, controversy, raw gunfights... But I only got some stupid figurines with X-Ray vision and the only red thing I saw in this game is its title.The overall feeling about the game is like I was playing some beta version. So many things could have been done much better. Yep it a playable game but I believe there are better games to spend your money on. 5/10, B - for BoringPersonal: Hey some bad guys came to rescue me from prison transport, COOOL lets roll, heres my MP-5. Plenty of cops to shoot thats it. Shoot the first one, there he is, aim for the chest and ""plupt"" miss. WHAT? The cross was right on him. Ok fire next one ""plupt"" what the hell is this sound? Am I really firing a weapon? ""Plupt"" Yep finally a hit. Or is it? Wheres the blood? No flinch? Did he even register he is injured? Why is he just staying in the middle of the street? WTF? Ok next hit, nothing, ok next one, nothing. After like six hits he finally goes down. And this is it for another five or six hours of gameplay.			"

												Violence in our video games is a pretty common thing nowadays, and while there is nothing wrong with that I don't think that the true extent of violence's effect on people is looked at very well. You can gun down a bunch of people in video games and it seems that it doesn't have too much effect on the story, with exceptions to Undertale and Dishonored. Our protagonists kill so many people that they, reasistically at least, are either sociopaths who don't care about murder or have therapy bills up to the roof. Games seem to ignore this aspect in the story, and if anything try to downplay it by showing that they're emotionally stable and act just like normal people even though they've killed more people than some wars have, even giving witty one-liners like in GTA. Ultimately, it's an ignorable aspect of these games, and competent writers do a good job with making these characters likable, but you almost never see a developer make a ♥♥♥♥ed up character who can't think straight because of the killing they've done. That's where Kane and Lynch: Dead Men comes in. Made by IO Interactive, the studio known for the Hitmen games, Kane and Lynch: Dead Men looks at this issue from a much more interesting angle. Does it do it well, though? Let's take a look.STORY: You're Kane, a former mercenary on death row for killing a bunch of people. However, when you're being transported to be killed, you and Lynch, a fellow inmate, are broken out by a mercenary group called The7. Unfortunately for Kane, The7 have beef with him for running away, leaving men to die and taking a bunch of cash. Kane is forced to get the money back, as they have his family held hostage and will kill them if he doesn't do it, with Lynch tagging along as help as well as someone to snitch to The7 if he ♥♥♥♥s up or tries to run. Things don't go as they should, and Kane and Lynch go after The7. The story is actually pretty solid despite some cliches, it provides a fresher twist on the story by putting it through the perspective of two guys who would be the villains in most other games and it feels like they put effort into it. It does jump around here and there, at one point they just robbed a bank in the US, then all of the sudden they're in a nightclub in Japan, but it could have been much worst in that regard and it's not too bad. There are two endings, both being kind of depressing, but are still solid and aren't horrendously sequel-baity. Sadly the game is pretty short, I finished it in about four hours, though to be fair, it feels like a complete story and, while some stuff here and there could be added, it feels about as long as it should be.GAMEPLAY: 3rd person shooter. You can carry one primary weapon, one sidearm, and a couple types of grenades around with you. If you're downed during combat, Lynch or another AI companion will hit you with some adreneline, but if you go down in a close timeframe from your last hit, you'll OD on it, which encourages you to stay in cover as much as you can. Unfortunately for the player, the cover system is broken at best and at worst barely functions, as you only seem to go into cover at the ends of things that you can take cover behind, which feels weird. Shooting feels too loose as well, and while it isn't as bad as cover, it's mostly mediocre. You can also command Lynch and your later companions in crime, but unfortunately the command system is kind of barebones and the AI can be pretty stupid. Moving around is fine enough at least, but for the most part, the gameplay is average. I wouldn't say it's unplayable like a decent amount of people say it is, in fact it's far from it, but it's nothing special and the game is held back by it.GRAPHICS, LEVEL DESIGN, AND PERFORMANCE: It's a game originally released on the Xbox 360 back in 2007, don't expect a pretty game. There are some bad looking textures even for 2007's standards, though it doesn't look terrible and some leeway has to be given to a game almost a decade old graphically. The performance is solid, I got a consistant 60FPS and if it ever dipped below that, I didn't notice it, and the cutscenes are pretty solid for that time. There are also a lot of cool levels, like a nightclub in Japan packed with people (who you can gun down if you want to), opium fields in Venezuela, and a fight in a construction yard which are nice to play around in.CHARACTERS AND VOICE ACTING: Let it be known that you probably will not like Kane and Lynch, as they are not good people and the game does not go out of its way to make you like them. Kane seems to know right from wrong and he does know that he should be dead, he's just alive so he can protect his daughter and take out The7, but he is a sociopath who kills people and doesn't seem to feel bad. Lynch seems like a better character initially, though it turns out he is a schitzophrenic who has phychotic episodes even if he does take his medication, snaps easily and kills people while blaming his schitzophrenia for it which might not be the full story to why it's happening. They also don't look like the traditional protagonists; they're older, balding, Kane's nose is broken and he has a ♥♥♥♥ed up scar, Lynch is overweight, they look and act like side villains in a video game. With that said, I did kind of end up liking Kane and Lynch, at least to some degree. They both know they're killers and nothing more, which is strangely refreshing to play as. The rest of the characters are mostly irredeemable or unlikable as well, which feels right for a band of killers. The voice acting is top notch as well, which lends to making the characters feel believable.MULTIPLAYER: There is co-op, though sadly online co-op is not possible, which is a real shame because it would be fun to play this with a friend. If you do play as Lynch during co-op, you get to see the psychotic episodes he goes through in the story through his eyes, which is a badass feature that they added which adds to the character. There is also an online mode which I did not bother with since I'd need to make a Games With Windows account and it's most likely dead anyway, though I hear it actually isn't that bad.FINAL THOUGHTS: The gameplay is mediocre and while that does hold it back, Kane and Lynch: Dead Men has enough going for it that I feel condifent in recommending it. 7/10, I might be a bit generous to the game, and at it's original $60 I can see it being not worth it, but for eight bucks while not on sale, it's a bargain. If you do want to wait for a sale, I can understand that, but do pick it up at some point, because Kane and Lynch: Dead Men is something really special, and I'm hoping that IO Interactive do something with the franchise in the future.

												Well that sucked. I noticed before even playing this game, that Steam was warning me, by the game not even starting up. ""We're warning you! It sucks! Just back out while you have the chance."" This is actually a big problem for a lot of people who buy this game (And the solution is so simple. You just have to install the Xlive folder in the actual game.) But, where does one begin with Kane and Lynch? ... Probably with Kane and Lynch. They suck. They are the least-likeable a-holes I've met in a game. And I'm supposed to connect with them, according to the game. Look! Whenever Kane get's shot down he thinks about people yelling at him. I'd rather call him a wuss than an empathetic character. I started to like Lynch for his dark comedic moments, but as the game went on, he just turned into this hate-spewing jerk that would ruin a lot of missions and cause them to go on far longer than they'd have to (In the actual script). He also ruins a lot of tries I've had at levels, because the AI is so off in this game. Enemies are not only really dumb, but the ""tactical"" system of the gameplay turns into babysitting, since most of my squadmates wanted to go out and shake hands with the enemy. And if an ally is shot down, they're on a timer for you personally to heal them. I never found out an alternative to have my other allies heal them, but no. I'd have to run in the middle of enemy fire in the next 15 seconds or I fail the mission. Also the cover-shooting sucks horribly in this game. The game is incredibly picky about where you take cover, and even when you successfully take cover, most of the time enemies will shoot through your cover. I had a helecopter shoot through solid concrete and kill me. Solid concrete. If you can't take cover behind something that'd make sense to take cover behind (like bales of hay or low walls that just can't be used for cover, because it hurts their feelings) you could always duck behind them... after Kane hesitates a few moments to get his head shot. The whole time, I kept thinking about much better games I could be playing like Grand Theft Auto, Uncharted, or Mass Effect with much better characters and mechanics.Oh! And what's the biggest problem in the game? The story. It's a floppy, predictable mess. The places you go to have very loose connections and you can end up in the middle of Cuba dressed as a guerilla in the middle of a firefight with no explanation of how you got there, other than, ""We need to get so-and-so."" And all the characters besides Kane and Lynch involved in the story are just as unlikeable or just flat-out forgettable. The game tries to make me feel all emotional when bad things happen to Kane's family, but I had no reason to care for them OR him. In fact, I personally think that the more horrible things happened to Kane and Lynch, the better. They really deserve it. I like Niko Bellic, Tommy Vercetti, and Trevor- because they have redeeming qualities.... Well, maybe not Trevor, but still. Kane and Lynch have no redeeming qualities. They're just heartless jerks that kill tons of people. K&L also wanted to go with the choice-influenced ending, where you choose to stick with your mates and tough it out or go with the coward's ending. After playing this muddy game for so long, I didn't really care about the moral implications of my choice or the ""good"" or ""bad"" ending coming about. I chose the one that ended the game faster. Yeah, I'm a coward. Deal with it.This is a horrible game. The characters, story, and gameplay are all over the place and poorly put-together. Do yourself a favor and buy a Grand Theft Auto game. It's got better elements in all three of the categories, and you can feel like the a-hole for killing tons of people in it- not hate the characters for being a-holes.			"

												It says I played 13 minutes, but that's because I had to mess around to get this working and ended up running the exe from the folder instead, so when I finished the single player none of my time was clocked.There is a horrendous bug in this game, it will stutter every 4-5 seconds at all times, the cause of this is USB devices it seems, I had to unplug my mouse in order to play without the stutter up until about mid-way when the stutter came back but less abrasive. Other people had to disable all HID devices in order to play, there is almost no help online, the publisher(Square Enix) rushed this port, dumped it and abandoned it, Windows Live is still in the game, but it didn't cause me trouble I just backed out of it and played the single player.The multiplayer no longer functions as Windows Live is dead now, so don't expect coop or anything else the multiplayer contained, it's gone now.On to the game itself, I'll start by saying the story is the only redeeming part of this game apart from places where the combat raises itself to mediocre. The game stinks of early 7th generation TPS. The worst offender is the shooting mechanics, the guns are inherently inaccurate no matter what you aim at you'll have to shoot it almost thirty times just to land a hit, there is a reticule on screen, but if you're more than 10 feet from your target, every shot will land around the centre of the reticule.It's horrible.There are other mechanics to speak about like the horrible squad mates that will either follow you and kill one enemy every 5 minutes or attack an enemy you tagged to attack, regardless of all the enemies in-between, they will march into a hail of hot metal for one enemy, and when they get downed, you have to revive them.Oh and just for good measure they threw in some forced stealth sections that are instant-fail and can be failed by one of your 5 squad mates wandering into the enemy's line of sight, so, that's fun.It's about 4~ hours long and only good for the story and some really nice levels, but overall it's only worth playing once.Don't pay over €2 for it, if you really have to, keep it under €5.That's if you can get it running without audio or video issues.

												Jesus, this kotaku BIG TURD web site don't know ♥♥♥♥ about video games ! Kane & Lynch 1 & 2 are in my favorite games list. They are living Action-movies, with an outstanding level design, thrilling dynamic movie-style' story-telling, very immersive ""taking cover"" gameplay, and even the voices and the sounds are way better than in most games. You can replay chapters with different weapons, you always have enough ammo or you can pick up enemy weapons if not, and when you take cover for a while, you recover slowly, which is a very good gameplay option to keep you focus on the action. (better than running under enemy fire like a crazy rabbit to pick up ammo like in ""The Heist"" or than searching for med packs)The only big issue of this first part is the Very Annoying ""Game for Windows Live"". WHAT A PAIN FOR A GAME.In 2014, this game is still beautiful.Thanks to Square Enix & I.O. those games are as nervous and powerfull as their model HEAT. I want Kane & Lynch 3 !			"

												The game requires you to install GFWL. If you choose not to download your profile, which takes over 5 minutes, the game will not save your progress. If you have a controller plugged in, the game requires you to restart and unplug it to enable keyboard controls.I had played through the sequel before playing this because of GFWL. They play the same, and one game was more than enough to sit through.First, the guns are highly inaccurate to the point where using a mouse won't offer any advantage over a gamepad. This makes fights really tedious because it takes forever to dispatch all enemies at range.The cover system is rubbish. The game is meant to automatically stick to cover when running into it. Half of the time it does nothing and you just have to stand there to avoid being shot.Within the first hour of gameplay you are thrown into a turret section that lasts 5-10 minutes that you will need to replay from the beginning if you fail. Your partner will seem to randomly die or the vehicle will blow up triggering a game over screen and another attempt at the turret section. It also does not help that the controls are suddenly crap for that part.I quit shortly after the turret section because I had seen all this game had to offer from the first hour, and previously playing the sequel. Avoid this game.			"

												Given that the game cannot even install on windows 8 and above, I have to give this game a negative rating. This isn't an edge case, there are plenty of discussions on the forums detailing the same issues.

												This game is pretty bad. I'd say 3/10 single player. 5/10 co-op.Pros:>Fun villain protagonist and even worse ""buddy"">Break all the rules and be a general ♥♥♥♥♥♥ while running and gunning>Starts in the middle of the action>Good set ups to levels, such as running a heist and fighting through a civil war>Really, the heist level is pretty fun.Cons:>Campaign is less than 4 hours long (Most of my play time is from accidentally leaving the game running over night)>Clunky controls and gun mechanics>Grenades have a kill radius of about 2 ft, but good luck throwing them with any accuracy>All the guns have absurdly short ranges, even the rifles (except the scoped sniper rifle)>Even on the higher difficulty, most of the threats come from enemies positioned right around corners or in cages over your head, or snipers. These guys will kill you before you can react, even on the lowest difficulty. Thanks for the help>The AI is rough, and your companions will manage to kill about 1 person a level.>Because the AI is crap, its obvious that most of the moooks, snipers, tanks, helicopters, etc. are gunning for you only 99% of the time, which really takes you out of the game and negates any strategy you may attempt in using the squad commands to draw fire or get a crossfire set up.>All those awesome level set ups and concepts devolve into so-so gunfights with little strategy or positioning possible.>To limit the use of gun emplacements you find through the game, the rate of fire slows down until the gun finally stops firing after about 10-15 seconds like the thing was battery powered. The bullets come farther and farther apart, and the last few pretty much dribble out of your gun like the last few drops of water from a bottle. Just wait 5 seconds more for it to charge up a bit! But the enemies can use these emplacements without any slowdown to mow down your companions over and over. Really awkward. I'm not the fan of typical overheat mechanics in games, but that would have been much better.>Not enough back story to understand your reputation, or why your character chooses to trust certain people over others.There are a lot of good ideas that weren't executed on well:>Using RPGs to knock out armored vehicles and helicopters. This seems AWESOME, in practice its tedious. The explosions from rockets and grenades are lackluster, and the vehicles don't appear different or damaged even if they are knocked out. Sometimes you pump extra shots into them for a bit before you realize the helicopter is slowly crashing or the armored vehicle has stopped firing. >At one point, your allies radio that they found a tank after you left them at the base of a building so you could clear the way. AWESOME! Time to rock a tank! WRONG. By the time you get down from the building, they have driven the tank to the other side of the buiding for no reason and have abandoned it. They literally drove it about 30ft after you had cleared out most of the threats. But you get to look at it! That's just as fun!>High stress jeep ride through the jungle while you man the gun on the back. AWESOME. How could this be boring? Well, it feels like the jeep is going about 20mph, the gun (like 90% of the guns of the game) can shoot accurately at about 10 ft, and its super scripted, so if you die, you can expect everything to happen the exact same way again. >The ending happens the way it happens no matter what, it fits the story, but is set up in a way that makes it seem like if were faster or chose a different route, things would happen differently. But scripted events and even an invincible enemy ensures the story happens just as planned. In all, it was a fun break from more serious games, but you'll probably play it only once, or maybe twice if you want to run back through with a friend. Buy it on a steep discount sale, or move on.

												Kane and Lynch: Dead Men is not a game with a particularly stellar reputation and it's not hard to see why.  The story line is nothing special but the ambient audio is fairly well done.  Where Kane and Lynch fails is in its combat and enemy ai.  Inexplicably, enemies can take multiple shots to the head and body seemingly to no effect only to be easily dispatched at slightly closer range.  The developers may have intended this to reflect greater innacuracy at a distance, but the way it is implemented is confusing to the player.  With each hit the enemies draw blood but are not otherwise staggered making it difficult to determine if any damage is being dealt.  Had I purchased this at release and paid full price, I would be very disappointed, but the online co-op mode makes the title worth a bargain price.  I would recommend Kane and Lynch: Dead Men as a bargain, below average FPS.			"

												Kane and Lych is probably one of  the most dissapointing shooters i have played. The story in this game is pretty weak. You play as Kane and you are rescued by the7 to recover some of theyre goods. Kane must do it because if he doesnt they will kill his family after he does retrieve the goods they still Kill his wife and take his daughter so Kane must find them with the help of his psycho patner Lynch. The story falls flat and the choice in the end doesnt help at all ( only adds another mission ). The Ai is awfull and will always get in youre range of fire and when youre down take theyre time to help you up. The aiming is awfull and the hit detection is abysmal. The grapchics are mediocre and dont do much. The multiplayer is unique and quite fun but have good luck to find somoene to help you with that. Some of the missions are quite fun but some are really hard . Overall this game is just another bargain bin type game only get it on sale its not worth the full price and its quite dissapointing i give it a 6/10			"

												Kane and Lynch: Dead MenPositives:+ A nice array of weapons available, although with this said there definitely could have been more as well.+ Funny dialogue between Kane and Lynch which really lightens up missions, I had quite a few laughs.+ Decent storyline.+ Shooting is fun, but the hit detection is not 100% accurate, which detracts from the experience a little.Negatives:- This is a very short game. I finished it on the highest difficulty in just 6 hours. Only purchase it on sale like I did and never pay full price.- Very linear gameplay, no open world exploration or opportunity to do so.- Bad graphics.Overall Score: 6/10Kane and Lynch: Dead Men is a fun, short action game which will entertain you.

Kane and Lynch: Dead Men™ is quite an ugly dramatic crime story heavily discussing the line between loyalty and betrayal among any relationship including the main characters. Upon the beginning, the audiences will become immediately alarmed by the harsh nature and eventually will question themselves if certain characters are either former law abiding citizens with homicidal tendencies or were always degenerates with no redeeming value. Despite the engaging thematics and voice acting, certain parts including the controls could be considered endlessly repetitive. Aside from optional modes for any players comfort, and undoubtedly the immersible sections near the final chapters of the story, the remainder of the game however lacks enough content to entitle it more replay value if such is desired.I only recommend this solely for its originality and strong effort as the first installment in the Kane and Lynch franchise.

												I saw the Youtube videos and was convinced that this game might actually be ok. This is not the case. The graphics are primitive, as is common from this developer, and the controls are just awkward. The shooting controls are bad but not unusable once you realise that shooting from behind cover is a waste of time and just aim at enemies directly. The gameplay consists of running into a scene and 10-20 enemies show up and you are informed with no shortage of expletives what your mission is, pretty much just shoot them all and make a getaway.In some ways I want to be lenient because it probably achieves its goal of being a throw-away shooter. But I can't when I even regret paying peanuts for it and I'm not even going to waste my time or other people's time pretending this is anything more than mediocre. This is going in the bin where it belongs. There are far better alternatives to choose from.			"

												A painfully average and forgettable game that isn't particularily interesting or memorable in the slightest, as there are really no defining features that make Kane and Lynch stand out compared to other shooters. The game mechanics are serviceable for the time but third person cover based shooters have been done far better in more recent years and there is really not much else to the game in terms of features, it just feels like cover based shooting moving to cover based shooting throughout the whole game. The game's story is very bland and uninteresting, neither Kane nor Lynch are particularily interesting characters and the game doesn't do much with the setup of villain protagonists to make memorable characters and story. The game abandons the urban environments two thirds into the game and becomes another generic jungle military style game. Its also far too short; I beat it on normal in around 5 hours. Also, co op doesn't work because it has GFWL.Probably the most memorable part of the game is an early mission inside the nightclub. You have to make your way through a crowded nightclub while using a hostage as a human shield, you're limited to just a pistol and the enemy gang members are hidden within the crowd and aren't immediately visable, it reminded me of some of the crowded party missions in Hitman: Blood Money. If there were more interesting or memorable segments like this, the game may have been worth playing but moments like this a lost in a sea of forgettable shooting segments.If you want to play a single player crime game where you control a group of criminals and plan heists, play Grand Theft Auto V instead. Kane and Lynch is definitely not worth playing unless you want a short, generic crime shooter that you can beat in an afternoon and then forget about.			"

												Kane and Lynch: Dead Men is a brainless and lackluster 3rd person shooter. The game makes little attempt for the player to even care about the story or the characters in this game. The gameplay is nothing special, you run around just shooting people with controls that are wonky and using weapons with terrible recoil and accuracy. The campaign is very short, I was able to beat it in less than 4 hours. Also, the performance with today's systems is terrible. At times I get 60 FPS and at other times it drops to below 20 FPS; I've also had several times my video card drivers crashed with this game! This game is nothing special, has terrible controls, dumb AI (your team doesn't even do anything and the enemies just stay in one spot) and makes no attempt to create a good storyline with memorable characters. I also forgot to mention, the game uses the dreaded Games For Windows Live (GFWL) and you cannot start the game unless you have the GFWL client installed on your system.			"

												Kane and Lynch is a pretty bare-bones action game. It doesn't bring anything really great to the table. The story is really lacking - its just a typical 'my daughter's kidnapped by the bad guys I used to work for; they want us to do X job or she dies'. Throw in a sidekick that's a sloppy ripoff of the character Waingro from Heat, and that's Kane and Lynch for you.The gunplay is wildly erratic at times; shooting long distance is frustrating as most bullets are off quite a bit. The engine is more or less the same as older Hitman games (same company) so the physics, especially when shooting bad guys, can be downright comical. Overall its a forgettable game, without achievements or trading cards, and it taking about 4 hours to beat (even on its toughest setting). it's a tough pill to swallow. However if you like mindless action, you really can't go wrong - just don't pay more than a buck or two. It's better than some movies and games I've experienced. It's not Bad Rats...			"

												Kane and Lynch strives to achieve so much yet fails epically on all accounts.If there was ever a time to listen to people, to give it a chance, this was most certainly not it as quite frankly you would have to be a masochist to get anything from this bumpy ride.Profanity aside you play as kane, one of two characters broke out of prison for a mission quite frankly i forgot 15 minutes in. From level to level you meter out death that despite kanes protests the game did sod all to prohibit. In other words i started shooting the innocent too, but in my defence, i was bored so shoot me.The controls on offer were vast, sadly none of them worked well and dont get me started on the cover system so some timish i swear i could hear lynyrd skynyrds freebird taunting me. So with the mess thats on offer the best tactic was to run at everything and shoot it in the face. AI team mate controls were excellent if you wanted them dead and the save system sucks if you stop the whole game, meaning if you dont finish a level, your sure as hell going to have to do it again when you reboot.I can only hope while kneeling and praying on broken glass that Kane and Lynch 2 is an improvement as i certainly dont wish to self harm again.So all in all i wouldnt recommend playing this game even if all the others disappeared off the planet and would go as far as saying have you consided knitting.Well from me it gets a thumbs down but so you understand the severity, its so down it transcends even hell and if it was ever to get a thumbs up or a fist in my opinion, im sure you can imagine where i would be putting it.

												This was a surprisingly good game. It's not great by any means, but if you can be forgiving of its shortcomings, the plot will reward you.PROS+ Excellent story. The setup drags a little bit, but once you're into the meat of things, it keeps you hooked.+ A solid script, characters who are less heroic than your average shooter, and nice voice-acting add a lot of gravitas.+ There are some truly great setpieces worth experiencing, namely a shootout in a crowded nightclub and a moving daylight shootout through the streets of Tokyo. They're reminiscent of Michael Mann movies like Collateral and Heat.+ The squad commands allow you to employ some complex tactics in firefights, advancing under covering fire, guarding each other's flanks, etc.+ Some inspired moments of art direction.CONS- The weakest levels and least polish - including an atrocious driving level - are all up front, meaning that if you bounce off the game you'll bounce off hard.- The A.I. isn't terrible, but the things that it does well - flanking and maneuvers - are limited by linear level design that doesn't cater to it and exposes its weaknesses.- The cover system is inconsistent. You'll abandon it pretty quickly, not that it makes a huge difference in the gameplay.- Lack of polish abounds. Jagged edges, texture bugging on an early level, some too-simple level design.- Games for Windows. We all know why.PRO OR CON???There are some nasty difficulty spikes, even on Easy mode. It takes some trial and error. Normally, that kind of unevenness wears thin very quickly for me, but something about the story kept me going at it anyway.This is a SOFT RECOMMENDATION. It's not a big money risk, given its sale prices now, and you can finish it in a few evenings max, so it's not a big time sink either. Story's worth it, and a few moments are very memorable.			"

												Well, I gave it 73 minutes of my life but no more will I give it.  I picked it up during a Humble Bundle thinking it may be fun, it wasn't.  I don't like third person shooters, that said, I can deal with it.  What I can't deal with, is having to order about an NPC (which yes could be co-op'd) or deal with enemies I can't possibly defend against (the hiding feature is flawed, the little sniper window is kind of cool, until you realize thats you).  I also have major qualms with the adrenaline thing, if you're going to kill me, let me die, restart my area and try again, don't put me back into the ♥♥♥♥ where I'm going to get taken out again within 5-10 seconds of recovery.I'm not the only one who feels this way, but I would not recommend it.

												This game is good like a B horror movie is good. The game also has a strange ambiance of North Korea.This game is bad. The ""frustration"" dialogue and acting is really really top notch. The plot dialogue is cheesy and forced. There are honest to goodness invisible walls... I mean come on now, WHAT YEAR IS IT??The gameplay is repetitive and the weapons are largely ineffective. You know how all the bad guys in a movie have terrible aim? Well Kane & Lynch gives you those terrible weapons. On that note, I didn't really feel ""♥♥♥♥ ed"" by the game (played on ""Aspirin,"" which I surmise to be a Starbucks ""Tall"" or an everywhere  else ""easy""). Like, if you're getting shot at, you're going to die, so you better stay behind cover. It does get grating when you're using the same old weapons and everything requires a ton of bullets to kill, though.Finally about the atmospere of the game. Everywhere you go is really desolate. It's a lot like that drive through of Pyongyang... there's just nobody on the roads or milling about or anything. The level design is also ♥♥♥♥... at one point you're just ♥♥♥♥ing walking around a prison during lock down with no closed doors to the contol room LOL. Also, the levels start of exceptionally terrible, and then as the game goes on they increase to just bad, which I've never even seen before.So, if you're the type of person to laugh at rochambeau-ing with pistols, to laugh at the utter lack of security at a maximum security prison, then give this game a try when it's on deep discount ($10 max, I would give it). If you're not, then you might as well go play the old Hitman games (seriously, the levels are really reminiscent of games from THAT long ago, that's how bad they are).Overall though, if you miss this game, you're really not missing much.

												8/10: Unexplored personalities with a rushed story, and amazing scenes worth playing either on the console or PC version. Play on easiest difficulty due to how cheap some of the deaths will be like the random shot to the head after they stopped firing.Pros:No nonsense main charactersMost of the story is told through action or dialogue as the players progress the level4-6 hours of gameplay for the campaign (no padding)7 of the 12 levels are very memorable, from invading a skyscraper to kidnapping a lady in a dance club.Cons:Kane's dubious past is never clarified as to what he did (as in, the severity of his war crimes when he was a mercenary). Lynch's past of being a black-out rager was easy to understand and the need to worry about his meds never became a  factor in the game. Even worse, the sequel almost never had it mentioned.Buggy release - Had to restart two levels due to Lynch not following me. Best played in co-op so that doesn't occur, but the levels are short and on Easy difficulty, took 3-4 minutes to reach those glitch areas again.The endings allow the sequel to have both be canon, in a bad way. One is more disturbing than the other. I label it as a con because the difference between the two is a big deal and should have been hinted better in the sequel. Also, one of the endings is forced, regardless of your performance. I hate when games do that sort of thing (taking the game out of a videogame).Part of the controls in the game aren't utilized, like swapping guns with team mates.Damage is location based while providing no real cover to the head. Expect instant deaths frequently at higher difficulty settings.			"

It probably was good during its time.I downvoted this game because there were a few bugs to be fixed even in the launcher.This game used to befrom GFWL, but with GFWL down, and since it's in steam, i think steam needs to improve on the installer.1) After downloading and successfully installing the game, the game wouldn't launch.2) A bit of google got me to understand that i have to install GFWL.3) Luckily, that wasn't too difficult, it's just in the game's steam folder however i don't understand why steam cna't just include that step for installation since it's required to run the game.4) I encountered 1 crash during the whole playthrough.Installation aside, now to the actual gameplay review.Like what you probably read in other steam or online reviews, the aiming/ hitbox is bad! It was so horrible in the beginning i felt like i wanted to give up on the game. Playing single player, the ""teammates"" you have are almost nonexistent other than for reviving you. Maybe someone can comment on coop experience. Story telling wasn't exactly fantastic also. They did try to give it a 2 different ending scenario choice, but there just wasn't any development in the characters. The ""dying"" scene during playthrough can be quite annoying as well. You will never know whether your teamamates will revive you and it just keeps looping some old dialogues and flashes a white screen. (Maybe i'm lousy so i see a lot of it) but its just plain annoying after a while.I felt that the game did have potential, but it just didn't pull through.Currently installing the part 2. I hope it will be greatly improved. I may also grab a friend to try out the coop experience. Hope it's better.			"

												I love the company who made this; they are one of my favourite production companies. But I did not like this game. The shooting is probably the best part and even that is average at best. The gameplay feels clunky, outdated and frustrating. The weapons are pretty average, nothing fun to use. The characters are fine for about 5 minutes and then they just turn annoying. The overall story was alright but left me feeling very dejected, the endings are a real slap in the face. Perhaps the dialog can redeem this slightly, but not enough for me to recommend this. If you want something like this get a Hitman game instead. Better gameplay, characters and story. I wouldn’t say avoid like the plague but only get this if you really want to see what all the hype was about when it came out, not for its lackluster gameplay. Don't get me wrong it has its moments but overall its a no.Have fun? ^_^			"

												Okay, I put three minutes into this but here we go, let's do thisSo I'm running a 980. Not a crazy 1080, 1070 or even a 980 ti or a 1060 or whatever.. basically the what, 7th or 8th best possible graphics card to own? One that is so far ahead of the curve it's insane? Yeah, anyways, I launch this game. Immediately greeted with the ♥♥♥♥ing GFWL screen and had to mash my buttons to get out of it. Whatever, I thought it was dead and done with since RE5 doesn't even have the GFWL in it at all anymore. But okay, I guess this game is pretty old, figures it hasn't been updated since nobody plays this game anymore. Anywho, time to start the game. So the difficulties are Aspirin, Codeine and Morphine. Like, wat. So I choose Morphine like any good chap would like after they get their appendix removed. And behold, first cutscene. Then somehow the game transitions into the game world, very, very slowly, as things start to slow down a lot. I couldn't quite tell if it was supposed to be this way until I see Lynch hitting this dude with the butt of the shotgun and it takes like two seconds for it to cycle through the three visible frames that occupy that scene. Next thing I know, after the ♥♥♥♥ing slideshow comes to an end, I'm in the game, and it's just as bad. The mouse scrolled probably one of the biggest distances so I knew right away this is meant for a controller but moreover it was completely, and utterly unplayable in this state. Like people were running this on 460's back in the day. Like holy ♥♥♥♥, I'm on a 980 why in god's name is it running like molasses, leaking from my very monitor. Like, oh my god, what an awful game. It needs an update so badly, it's insane to imagine it is being sold like this. Save yourself the 50 cents that this game will inevitably be sold for when it's on sale because you can't even run it.			"

												Kane and Lynch: Dead Men™, made by the developers of critically acclaimed action shooter series ""Hitman"" comes back with a bit more slowly paced, tactical-focused game. Nah muh níggas I'm just playin witchu.Kane and Lynch is indeed made by the same guys who made Hitman series (they even let you know of that in the intro). One day, someone thought ""Guys, we be makin dem stealth games but what if... a shooter?"" and so the Kane and Lynch happened.  DER PLOT Kane (the protagonist) is an ex-mercenary. We meet him in a prison van that is taking him to (hehe what a plot twist) the prison where he will get fried for being a baddie hired gun. His thoughts revolve around his wife and daughter, both of which he abandoned and now he regrets it (good timing, bro). In the same van we meet Lynch, pretty much a psycho who killed his wife during one of his ""blackouts"" as he calls them.Then suddenly BAM BOOM KAPOW RATATA SOME MASKED GUYS ATTACK THE CONVOY AND GRAB KANE AND LYNCH WITH THEM AND OH GOD EVERYONE SHOOTS EVERYONE, COPS DROP LIKE FLIES, WHAT A FUKKEN CHAOS, JESUS CHRIST ALMIGHTY. Turns out that they were hired by some super top secret criminal organisation which Kane stole loadsamoney from in the past and now they make him get the money back. Lynch is freed because Kane needs a sidekick and who would make a better sidekick than a psychopath?Long story short: they set on an adventure to retrieve the money for the crime syndicate, making friends and enemies on their way. However, Kane faces a personal tragedy by the hands of the criminal people and that makes him upset enough to actually shift his focus on killing them instead of killing cops, Japs, and Jap cops as he did by that point. He then goes to South America and whoops their criminal a$$es. Lynch is with him all the time and he fuks shít up because he's a psycho.Kane and Lynch then shoot the criminal men. The end. DER GAMEPLAY If you ever played any Hitman game I think you can agree that shooting wasn't really the strong point of the series. It didn't matter, Hitman is about stealth anyway. Here however their lack of experience shows (well in 2003 they made this shooter called Freedom Fighters, it was rather good, you can look it up). It's not bad, aight? Not very good but not bad either. I had a feeling like weapons don't generally deal much damage and are very inaccurate. When you get downed one of your mates can inject one marijuana into your eyeball to revive you, but once he does that, you cannot get revived for again some time because otherwise you overdose and die. Sounds fun and all but when you get injected and then get shot down quickly afterwards, instead of immidiately dying, you have to wait for a guy to come to give you another marijuana shot which kills you. WHY CAN'T I IMMIDIATELY DIE INSTEAD?!?!?!?! This works both ways. Sometimes your mates get knocked out too and you have to give them the medical weed, otherwise they die and it's game over. You can give your men simple commands like ""stay here"", ""follow me"", ""go there"", ""attack that nígga"", etc. I generally didn't use them but sometimes they came in handy. DER CONCLUSION Kane and Lynch: Dead Men™ is not the best game I have ever played. It is above average, I'd say. However, despite some very questionable design choices both gameplay and plot wise, I enjoyed this title. The game looks pretty ok to me even today. The story reminds me the action movies starring Bruce Willis or some shít like that. It was really neat.6,7/10 on my scale. If it's on sale or something, definitely worth picking it up. Also has co-op mode but didn't try it.			"

												What's the fuc**** point of release this port on steam if it works just as bad as the old one (games for windows), not only it crashes if you don't install certain .DLL, but it also messes with your sound (if you have a creative sound card, DON'T BOTHER, AT ALL. If you have on board sound, Pray, you MIGHT get lucky and the sound wont be a glitchy mess that makes you turn it down to zero). Add the several graphical glitches and game crashing bugs (that i never met on ps3 or x360 ports) and done. The only way to ""fix"" the sound gound insane glitch is to exit the game, and going back in. It should last ok for about 2 chapters, then? Repeat. Game is GOOD actually, the story is awesome, it IS fun to play, but goddammit, this port is so broken that i can't give it a thumbs up.			"

												Just finished the game on Codeine (medium) and here is my new review because my opinion changed since I played through the whole thing. This game is not good and the second game is worse, stop ♥♥♥♥ing making Kane and Lynch games they are ♥♥♥♥ and nobody ♥♥♥♥ing enjoys them.Story------I have never in my life encountered such a  band of ♥♥♥♥ing fuccbois for characters in my life, nobody in this game is likable and worth caring about. Nobody has ANY redeeming qualities about them, the story is ♥♥♥♥ and exists because Lynch is a ♥♥♥♥ing basketcase retard who never ends up being likable in any way. Kane is some ♥♥♥♥ing Max Payne remorseful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t emotional jackass who I want dead as much as anybody else in the game. The swearing in the review is completely mild compared to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ swearing in the game, EVERY 1-5 SENTENCES HAS THE WORD F___ OR SH__ FOR NO REASON. Swearing is used to express emotion but in this game it literally makes no ♥♥♥♥ing sense, and it doesn't work at all. DID I MENTION THE WHOLE GAME NEVER GIVES YOU CONTEXT FOR THE STORY? HAHA OH YEAH THAT...HALF THE STORY IS BASICALLY MISSING. For example ""I always pay back my debts..to the last penny."" when he kills the Yakuza leader Retomoto but we have NO IDEA what the ♥♥♥♥ he is talking about and no context is given the story is like ♥♥♥♥ing dark souls.Gameplay---------Trash..it gets old really quick and nothing is really redeeming about itGunplay is ♥♥♥♥ because the guns have ludicrous recoil and spread so you have to struggle to ♥♥♥♥ing hit anything that isn't right in front of you.Enemies literally everywhere and almost everywhere you go either cover is garbage or your AI lemmings walk into bullets forcing you to go out of your way in the OPEN to REVIVE ANIMATION them in order for you not to fail the ♥♥♥♥ing mission.Way too many mounted machine guns in this game that you have to STRUGGLE to ♥♥♥♥ing hit with your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ spread guns like what the ♥♥♥♥ dudeYour AI lemmings serve no purpose in this game, I mean they can kill ♥♥♥♥ thats like 2 feet in front of them or maybe a few enemies when you sic all four of them on some guy but they suck ♥♥♥.Snipers are a joke, you jiggle back and forth to not get hit until you figure out where the fuccboi is and kill him or you get one shot.The Havana level is a travesty of a level because of all of the above, literally mounted machine guns everywhere and you can't hit them easily with your garbage guns.Music/Atmosphere/Whateverelse----------------------------------The aesthetic is somewhat okay, the game is so dark and edgy and crime-focused that it adds up to barely not ♥♥♥♥. You end up fighting pretty much every major crime stereotype except for black gangbangers and some variants of the mafia.Music is forgettable and ♥♥♥♥♥♥, does nothing to help the mood or soften the blow of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.Whatever else IDK its ♥♥♥♥ don't play through this ♥♥♥♥ing gameALSO NO PC CO-OP HAHA THEY DIDNT SAY THAT ON THE STEAM PAGE WHAT A JOKE GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE WOO ITS TOTALLY ♥♥♥♥End statementStory and gameplay are forgettable and trash bin material.Rest is passable but nothing special.(-9/11) ""Like reanimated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with guns!"" -IGN			"

Too many enemies, no checkpoints, and your retard teammates get themselves killed and you gotta start over.♥♥♥♥ the cuba level. Nuff said.Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ all of it. ♥♥♥♥ that ♥♥♥♥. The devs were 100% trying to be as much of an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as possible. There's no way nobody in testing didn't say ""Hey, this is too hard, you should tone it down a bit."" they 100% knew what they were doing, so ♥♥♥♥ it.			"

												It has the most massive and irritating lag spikes ever, and all my specs are of what you'd run most games on med-high settings at least. I have everything toned down and it's still irritating. Every minute or so it lags for about 30 seconds, so I can hardly play it. Plus the game isn't even that good when I CAN play it.			"

												A friend wanted to play through the sequel so I thought I'd give this a go. An hour and five levels later (after 25 minutes spent sorting GFWL out) I wish I hadn't bothered. The guns how no accuracy past spitting distance and lack and sort of stopping power, the 'Lynch is crazy' stuff is poorly realised given I couldn't tell when he was having an episode most of the time and when he was, I was usually doing something else and couldn't pay attention to him and he kept getting himself killed  at places I couldn't revive him.Finally on the fifth level when they make you go through a large section of the level, then make you go back to the start and then make you fight your way out again sealed the deal. I was done with this game and just watched the cut scenes on YouTube so I have an idea of what is happening for the sequel which as I mentioned before, a friend wants to play co-op through.			"

												In all honesty, ""Kane and Lynch"" is probably the worst game I've ever played. Or at least the one which gave me the strongest pain in the ♥♥♥. If the Hell is real and after death some people trap in it, the main torture in there is playing this game. Everything in this game is just horrible. If I didn't know that it was developed by the creators of Hitman, I would think that it's a debut work of some third-rate polish or russian developers. It has everything that typical classical polish shooter can offer you: - terrible dispersion (you can aim right at the enemy's head and bullets will hit anything but the space you are aiming at);- useless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s as your allies which are given to you not to help you but to die all the time in the places with most rapid crossfire so you will surely die when trying to resurrect them;- covering system (I swear I have never seen such a terrible one in any game) you leap to the walls radomly and you can never tell if they will protect you from the shots or not);- tons of enemies which shoot at you from every corner and whom you can't see through ♥♥♥♥ing gates/grass/trees etc.;- absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ story (though I must admit that I liked the characters) and absolutely mocking endings, both of them. Depending on the choice you make you will be either a moron or a traitor, nice huh?- optimization. I got constant fps drops on 2013 year config. For a 2007 game it's a little bit curious.Thanks God it lasted for only 5 hours.Avoid buying this game at all costs, not to save your money but to save your nerves.			"

												Background: I'm a long term FPS fan, I'm a PC gamer, not a PC gamer who likes ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console knock offs.This game is a serious contender for the worst game on Steam (at least for a FPS).  It looks like ♥♥♥♥, the story is just utterly ♥♥♥♥, I had no empathy at all for any of the characters.  Hmm whats that? One of your relatives died, well you deserve it for being in such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game!This game tries too hard and at the same time doesn't try hard enough.You have a character who is confident and an expert in the first level turning into an utter noob in the second level just so the game can give you a tutorial level .. just when you don't need it.  Be prepared for really terrible consolised controls.  Sometimes you'll have a tonne of friendly NPCs on screen with you, but 5 seconds later they will all be mown down and you are basically back on your own again.  Oh did I mention your buddy will take a few bullets and you need to go and give him an adrenaline shot to get him back on his feet?  This can be useful as a get out of jail card, but it feels lame.  There is coop, but its LOCAL coop.  You have one person on keyboard and mouse, the other on an xbox controller.  This is due to Games for Windows Live.At the end of the day though.  Games for Windows Live is just a very minor annoyance compared to everything else in the game.  Even when that spoiler spoilery ending happens .. I kinda laughed.			"

												Kane & Lynch: Dead MenPros-#1.Lynch is interesting#2.Many different maps#3.Co-op.I have not tried it but at least there is the option#4.The story is unique in the sense that there is no ""good guys""#5.There is multiplayer but there was nobody online playing for me to try itCons-#1.The AI is really stupid and unrealistic and will kill the game for some people#2.The story is nothing special but Lynch is the one good thing in it#3.The cover system and the aiming system both hurt the game and should of been improved#4.Not being able to skip cut scenes.I don't remember if I could skip some of them but I know for sure I couldn't skip them all and that sucked#5.The swearing is in overkill.I swear every day but it seemed a little excessive in this game.I could be wrong on this as I have no idea what the average prisoner or robber in America would call excessive swearing#6.I didn't like the ending of the gameThe selfish ending where he leaves the men behind to die seemed realistic.You shouldn't feel happy or rewarded for being selfish.I would of taken this ending out of the game anyway because it sucks even if it is realisticThe saving your men ending I didn't like it either.I think Kane should of died and Lynch and Jenny should of escapedI know that was not realistic since they were planning to make another Kane and Lynch game which they did.Kane would obviously have to survive both endings.I would rather Lynch got his own gameI just would of felt more sorry for Kane if he had died.I didn't find Kane to be interesting or likable.With his daughter dying I felt sorry for her and not him.If he had died than they could of shown her forgiving him.I think that would of been the best endingThe Bottom Line -Kane & Lynch: Dead Men is not for everyone.The gameplay is a thumbs down but the game does have a variety of different map locations.Lynch was the only interesting part of the storyThe game is made by the same people who make the hitman games.I kept waiting for 47 to show up because it looks so similar to the hitman series.Do not be confused the hitman games are much better than this.Hitman Blood Money has better graphics and gameplay and is older then K and LKane & Lynch also reminded me of the Max Payne series in the sense of nothing seems to go right for Max or Kane.The Max Payne games are much better than K and L so don't read too much into my comparisonIf I was you then I would pass on Kane & Lynch: Dead Men.The gameplay being the most important reason.The AI being so stupid and how hard it can be to aim at targets that are easily in range of the guns you shoot is very unrealisticIf you must buy it then get it $5 or less on steam and have low expectationsMy 2 centsDan "

												This game was a letdown in so many ways. The protagonists were mis-sold in advertising, the controls were sub-par, and the story made no sense at all. There are much better third-person shooters on the market, don't waste your time with this one.Note that when Steam says ""8 hours on record"" - I played all the way through the game.

												Wow, this was xtremely disappointing.Aside from the fact that I had to download the Windows Live garbage to get it to play (crashes not withstanding), this game is very, very rough. Some ""highlights"":-The most innacurate aiming I've literally ever played in a game. Seriously, how the hell can he not hit a person 15 f'ing feet in front of him?! Wherever your reticle is, the bullets will land within a 2-3 foot radius, making him about as accurate as a clumsy toddler.-Graphics are very, very subpar, even for a 10 year old game. It feels more like it's 15 years old, except it doesn't play as well as many 15 year old games. -FOV is a little off, which usually isn't a big deal, but it bothers me in this game.Unless you are willing to sacrifice gameplay and graphics for story, this game is very overrated. This is my least favorite game from IO, ever. Very disappointing.			"

												HaHaMan, I bought this game because I remember it being the bees knees back when the PS3 first came out. Saw it on sale and wanted to co-op it with a friend since this game is big on that. Turns out campaign co-op isnt even a thing you can do. Only couch co-op is available. I'm sure this game is still good, like how I remember it, but DO NOT buy this if you want to play a co-op campaign game with an amigo, y'know unless they're on the same computer as you.Played abit for giggles, it's aged, gameplay is still tight, and the story is still good enough.Still, not a game I'd recommened to anyone anymore, unless they play relics.

												This game had potential but got ruined by a lot of issues, I liked the missions but it was really hard to enjoy them. The shooting in this game is bad, you aim and get lucky if the gun even shoots in the directioin you're aiming, now I know you could easily say thats realistic, but its not realistic to shoot enemies and watch as the bullets go through them like they were ghosts. The cover system is even worse, you click into place like a magnet which can get fustrating because it can leave you in the open, this could've been easily solved with a cover button. The whole control your squad thing was almost useless, the only time I used the controls were to make Carlos go to the gate in that one mission and tell my squad to follow because sometimes they would get stuck. The story was ok just two guys killing every cop and security guard in every city they  attend to get revenge on a few other bad guys while trying to protect/recover his daughter. I see that some people are saying the characters are amazing, I beg to differ, they are just horrible guys that are very simple minded, which hurts the story because they don't and can't contribute to the story to make it more dynamic and interesting. Conversations between characters get old very quickly with every one ending is F**K You Kane, or F**K You Lynch, it was funny at first but then it just was overdone. Even the environments in the levels were generic.I think that this game could've been way better if worked on a little bit more, I'm still going to play the sequal because I'm curious if they fixed/improved this series. Like I said before I like the missions, the Japanese night club level was my favorite with the prison break in is a close second. They did do a good job of keeping you busy, there wasn't one time where I was bored or had nothing to do, had a lot of action. But with all the problems it just was not a good experience. I'm not bashing it just being honest.			"

												If you are looking for advanced graphics and smooth gameplay, you're at the wrong place. Kane & Lynch has several gameplay problems, an unprecise aiming and a unreliable cover system. However, if you are looking for a good story and experience, then you're in for a treat. This game tells a briliant crime drama starring fantastic characters that manage to be extremely charismatics and well developed even in a game this short. You can beat it in 5 hours, but these characters will stay with you for far longer than that.			"

												I'm not even dinging the game for the dated graphics.  Really, I don't mind.  Here's my complaint list:1) I just emptied a clip into the protruding parts of a cop who was ""hiding"" behind a pillar and he didn't even flinch (close range and I could clearly see the bullet streaks entering his body)2) Cover system is clumsy.  You'll be half dead before your guy decides he should actually use it.  It works wonders for the enemies (you'll never hit them), but is a garbage mechanic for the player (still get hit. a LOT.)3) This is another one of those games that refuses to let you use the mouse/kb if you have a controller plugged in.  I HATE having to unplug a controller just because these console-porting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ couldn't be bothered to add a simple toggle in the options.4) Obstacles that are very apparently not obstucting my line of fire get in the way - maybe it's because of my next complaint...5) 3rd person camera with no 1st person option.6) GFWL. /Facepalm.

												Holy crap this game is amazing. I always wanted to play this but for several reasons it eluded me. It really does seem to be underrated, drowning in the sea of silly controversy and the metric ton of games surrounding it. It has its flaws- The A.I. could be a bit smarter and the guns could feel a bit stronger(my only two real complaints). Aside from that, I thought the game held up exceptionally well by todays standards, it actually still looks better than I expected it to.Each section of the game seemed to be crafted with great care and interest..everything I did felt awesome. I think Kane & Lynch are both great characters and they are very well written. I found myself constantly wanting to know more about them and their past.I highly recommend giving this game a shot, especially now since its dirt cheap.Now I just wish Overkill(Developers of Payday 2) would take some queues on how to be a criminal from this game.

												I can't understand all the bad reviews! I absolutely loved this game and its cineastic story. This game is all about great storytelling and is not supposed to be some COD shooter.

												People told me this game is worth playing for story and characters. They didn't lie. What they forgot to tell me is to enjoy it, I'll have to fight outright broken cover-based mechanics.Nothing works as it should. Bullets often go through body parts sticking out of cover without doing any damage. Rilfes can't hit nothing reliably past 30m. Automatic cover system kicks in second you're close to solid object, instantly shifing camera angle, as far as 90 degree. Automatic reload (seriously, who came up with this?), often makes you unable to quickly shoot targets of oportunity. Allies constantly walk into line of fire, making you unable to shoot back. And I didn't even count how many times I was shot in back and killed by them.If someone wants to play it for grimdark story, he may try his patience during -75% sale. Everyone else should really stay away.			"

												It's the first game I ever quit on. I love third person shooters, but the controls in this game, just weren't responsive. Your guns have a wide spread and it makes it difficuly to shoot anything further than 35 feet. The story is intresting, but couple with the fact that the a.i. is incredibly dum, and you gotta make sure everyone is alive and accounted for to progress through the level. Well, I just got tired. I hope part 2 is better. I feel that it will be. The other thing that sucks is with GFWL shutting down, who know if this will be transferred over to steamworks. The good thing is that sequel is steamworks.			"

												One of my favorite Multiplayer games. The Singleplayer/Coop is really good too. The story was entertaining, and the whole ""He's your partner in the game, but not someone you should trust"" thing is executed very well. In the Multiplayer you rob banks/stores/etc. with your buddies, while also watching your back. At any time someone can kill you, become a traitor, and take your cash and run the hell out of there before your other buddies go after him. Really fun!			"

												So during a sale I bought a lot of things for my friends and a few things for myself. Two of the things I got for myself were from the recommendation of another. I had just finished Spec Ops: The Line and wanted another TPS, and a friend said I should get Kane and Lynch 1 and 2 (they were both four dollars).When these games came out, they weren't negatively received or anything - they just were received as pretty much average, and therefore they faded into obscurity, basically. A lot of people don't like them. Having played the first one in full and some of the second one, I'm not surprised that in this world where a lot of people like things such as Skyrim this is the case.The game develops the two main characters really, really well. You get a sense of who they are and what they are trying to do moreso than other games. There's little subtle things like hearing events of Kane's life in the past when you're on the ground about to possibly die, hearing mortally wounded police on the ground quietly breathe and beg to be spared, saying things like ""please...I have a family"", the fact that a lot of the NPCs that fight by your side lack any sort of empathy whatsoever, and most prominently, Lynch speaking to himself constantly throughout the game, with his psychotic tendencies very apparent. There's actually a scene where he ends up executing a bunch of hostages that need to be kept alive. I didn't know until just recently that if you play co-op, the person controlling Lynch actually lives out these events and hallucinates the hostages as being SWAT members. The ultimate irony is that all these sort of things on an individual level are more human of moments than Spec Ops is collectively with pretty much it's entire story - when that's a game that is supposed to be completely about that sort of thing. By the end of the game, the story I'd played felt very true and structured - not common in shooters. Why these games got 6 and 7 out of 10s is beyond me.			"

												In my older days, this game was the absolutely best game I have ever played! It was not so long time ago I actually replayed this game and it did not quite live up my expectations of what I remembered.GameplayThe game is about a criminal, who is in jail writing a letter to her daughter Jenny. Some dudes, help him escape and he found himself in a chair bounded and is asked to deliver back the money he stole from his old teammates. They have kidnapped her daughter until Kane delivers it back to them. To guard him, they hire a watchdog (Lynch) to look out for him and the journey begins.The gameplay is not as snappy you would probably like. It feels all a bit clunky and not responsive at all. The cover system is a bit average and so is the gunplay. It takes your through some interesting levels (locations) in the game and design of the levels is quite good. You have a squad you can use by calling commands, but it never never really used properly, and you are in most cases better of alone.It is worth pointing out that this game still uses Windows Live. It is quite frustrating and a battle to get this game to work on newer machines. I do not know if is a bug. It has been so long since I used Windows Live that can probably not remember my password. I had to do a work around to play it. A shame, since you buy in Steam.GraphicsThe game has not really aged very well. I feel like this game had a decent graphics for its time. The texture quality is low and it looks like you are playing on low quality. SoundThe writing of the game is not really interesting either. They use a lot of swear words, not there's anything wrong with that, but they constantly use it. The guns sound awful and they much louder than the game itself. I throught the soundtrack was pretty good. It gets you hyped and fits the levels well.VerdictYes, Kane and Lynch falls flat on pretty much every level, but it's not a bad game per se. It is just so average and does not bring up whole new set of stuff. I am going to recommend this game anyway, just because it holds a nostalgia value for me and I would probably also have picked it up sometime anyway.			"

												I really couldn't get into this short, around-six-hour long, third-person, cover based shooter game. In the beginning I thought at the very least the story would be a bit interesting and it was for a bit, at least the plot of it all. The dialogue is often inconsistent , there's overusage of the word ""fμck"", and the story devolves so much that halfway through it really does start turning into a military shooter with revenge being the agenda as opposed to a game about criminals getting their sh¡t together and being ""forced"" to do jobs. There are two endings to the game but unfortunately both are extremely dull and anti-climactic. The game's called ""Kane and Lynch"" but really the game's all about Kane up until the end with very few Lynch moments.Checkpoints are a thing (basically called ""scenes"") and some are oddly placed like they could be before a cutscene, which are all unskippable. If you leave the current game, no matter how fare you are, you'll have to start the entire chapter you were on from the very beginning.To take cover you're supposed to snap to the wall automatically though more than too often your character will take their time to snap to the cover or they won't snap at all because your angle is slightly bad. This doesn't help when I'm near a wall and all I'm trying to do is have a looksee.Aside from the sniper, the bullets in practically every gun spread hard no matter how good you are with controlled fire and aiming.The AI for your partners and the enemies are really dumb. Often times your partners will get out of cover in front of barrage of bullets thus having you to be forced to revive them so as not to fail.I'm sure this is at least somewhat more enjoyable through co-op but I ain't signing into GFWL for that. Plus I hear the multiplayer's dead anyway. "

												Summary: Short, uninspired, buggy.Kane & Lynch as an idea has all the elements that make Hitman, developed also by IO, work. A contracted killer, here a mercenary that worked as part of a group rather than a lone hitman, bound for death row, gets out of prison by his old group to make amends. His family is kidnapped and he has to comply to save them. Although a bit cliche, the story could work, but it simply doesn't. The characters are underdeveloped, the plot never gets deeper, while large gaps are left to fill in with your imagination.Gameplay-wise, the gunplay isn't anything to write home about, reminding of linear FPS that were considered outdated even by 2007 standards, with bullet-sponge enemies. The guns are often inaccurate, even in short distances and while firing with discipline (aiming, short bursts etc.). The cover system doesn't always work and sometimes while you are in cover you still get shot without the situation justifying it (e.g. when covering behind solid rock or cement that shouldn't be pierced by bullets. The AI is laughable, with some covering the wrong way opening themselves to shots, or when in groups just running straight at you, which diminishes any sense that you are fighting actual opponents. The game requires Games for Windows Live, and in newer systems you have to find out on your own and download the client yourself in order for the game to launch. Multiplayer is long-dead, co-op is off-line only, the campaign is short (I finished it in ~6 hours while really taking my time). There's also a few crashes and glitches, although this is an afterthought in the game which is already dissapointing.I got this as part of a bundle and it was as good as a movie you let play in the background. You can skip it safely and not miss anything, if you really want to play the second one (haven't played that yet, so no idea if it any good), just read the plot online, you're not missing anything.

Everyone else doesn't matter as they're just bullet fodder and occassionally kill people.  I'm almost done with the game, and I'm forcing myself to finish it to see most likely some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending. Don't spend your money on this. Even if it's on sale.			"

												I bought this as part of a Humble Bundle and finally got around to giving it a go. This game had a lot of potential. I enjoy games that involve ordering party members during combat. At times it felt a bit like their previous title Freedom Fighters. However, the nostalgia factor wasn't enough. You'll get 4-5 hours out of this game. The cover mechanics are just awful. Even if you do manage to stick to a wall the enemies can shoot through it. Co-op is local only. Microsoft DRM was a pain as I had to uninstall and reinstall manually from another source. At the start of the game (tutorial level) they showed you how to give someone a gun from your inventory but this ability was never required/benficial. The story was very weak. Anyway, you get the picture. I recommend you give this a skip.			"

												Summary: Short, uninspired, buggy.Kane & Lynch as an idea has all the elements that make Hitman, developed also by IO, work. A contracted killer, here a mercenary that worked as part of a group rather than a lone hitman, bound for death row, gets out of prison by his old group to make amends. His family is kidnapped and he has to comply to save them. Although a bit cliche, the story could work, but it simply doesn't. The characters are underdeveloped, the plot never gets deeper, while large gaps are left to fill in with your imagination.Gameplay-wise, the gunplay isn't anything to write home about, reminding of linear FPS that were considered outdated even by 2007 standards, with bullet-sponge enemies. The guns are often inaccurate, even in short distances and while firing with discipline (aiming, short bursts etc.). The cover system doesn't always work and sometimes while you are in cover you still get shot without the situation justifying it (e.g. when covering behind solid rock or cement that shouldn't be pierced by bullets. The AI is laughable, with some covering the wrong way opening themselves to shots, or when in groups just running straight at you, which diminishes any sense that you are fighting actual opponents. The game requires Games for Windows Live, and in newer systems you have to find out on your own and download the client yourself in order for the game to launch. Multiplayer is long-dead, co-op is off-line only, the campaign is short (I finished it in ~6 hours while really taking my time). There's also a few crashes and glitches, although this is an afterthought in the game which is already dissapointing.I got this as part of a bundle and it was as good as a movie you let play in the background. You can skip it safely and not miss anything, if you really want to play the second one (haven't played that yet, so no idea if it any good), just read the plot online, you're not missing anything.

												It's the first game I ever quit on. I love third person shooters, but the controls in this game, just weren't responsive. Your guns have a wide spread and it makes it difficuly to shoot anything further than 35 feet. The story is intresting, but couple with the fact that the a.i. is incredibly dum, and you gotta make sure everyone is alive and accounted for to progress through the level. Well, I just got tired. I hope part 2 is better. I feel that it will be. The other thing that sucks is with GFWL shutting down, who know if this will be transferred over to steamworks. The good thing is that sequel is steamworks.			"

												Janky and buggy, the Kane and Lynch games are worth at most $5 a pop... but if you can get past the lack of replay value and the unacceptably short single player campaigns (around 4 hours), they're worth playing.

I'm 3 hours in and I noticed a few audio glitches. The AI can be stupid at times and the camera can be annoying. However, the story is better than Dog Days and I love how it doesn't have the camera effects. However, multiplayer is uplayable because Windows Live is no longer active. The nostalgia is worth it on sale and you have to have patience while setting this up. You need Windows XP in order to play this or else you get 1 fps. 0/10			"

												First off, this is not a bad game. However, there are a lot of steps to play it; just wanted people to know whats coming.1. You have to get a Games for Window Live Account to use the access code.2. Make sure your firewall/antivirus isnt blocking3. Mutliple crashes when attemting login as multiplayer. You basically have to push space or whatever to stop background animations during login to the spawn of hell called Games for Windows Live.4. You can play with a keyboard, controller or a combination of the two. However, see #55. I use a Logitech F310 that emulates a 360 controller. This game does not see it that way; i was getting ""you need to have 360 controllers"" type errors. This fixed it http://steamcommunity.com/app/8080/guides/#scrollTop=100.6. Splitscreen. I finally figured it out. The screen ratio has everything to do with vertical/horizontal display; the smaller two gives you horizontal and the higher two give you vertical.I cant give a review on the game as i got it to play two players with my wife and well; see 1 through 6			"

												Not much to say here. A TPS as generic as they get. Extremely bland, and despite being short, feels like it overstays its welcome. Co-op is Local only, no option for Online. The game's got some remarkably large spread/cone of fire on its weapons, presumably with the intention of making shootouts last longer and appear more Hollywoodian. It works sometimes, but mostly it is an annoyance. It can be challenging in Morphine difficulty (especially the Cuba/Venezuela missions). Get it cheap if you must, it's not really a good game.			"

												Kane & Lynch: Dead Men is a third person shooter game with a few interesting twists, but ultimately the poor execution of some elements drag it down quite a bit.First off I've played this game a bit when it came out on Xbox, did a little bit of coop back then, but never finished it. It has been sitting in my Steam library for a while now until I recently decided to finish it. The game itself was released in a time where things were still good in the gaming business and companies churned out games at a fast pace. It was also a high time for Xbox and most relevantly coop was the thing every game needed to have.STORYThe game takes an interesting perspective from the bad guy who gets broken out of prison and is confronted with his past. Needless to say life as a mercenary is shady and he did some things his former employers couldn't agree with. His wife and daughter are leveraged and he is blackmailed into retrieving something. Beyond that the story gets rather predictive with failure and revenge as central pivoting points.GAMEPLAYAs said the game is a third person shooter and the controls handle a bit slow and rough, but when playing with the controller everything runs pretty good. Cover mechanics however are poorly done and for some reason you can only get in cover on the edge of a wall, even the lower ones. This is very frustrating since enemies are abundant and aim pretty good, even on the lowest difficulty. On the other hand most of your weapons have such low accuracy you really have to get very close to hit something. Result is that moving from cover to cover gets you killed most of the time, luckily your team-mates revive you almost every time.And that is pretty much the only thing they get right, other than that they're pretty useless. You have a few basic commands, but anything other than 'Stay here' or 'Come over' is pointless. You can order them to attack a specific target, but this just results in them rushing towards it and shooting them in the face with a shotgun. The animation however is pretty nice though. That's mostly the gameplay throughout the game, aside from a few vehicle missions.VISUALSThe game is a bit older, but it still looks acceptable, but nothing special. There is some destructibility, which was also very popular back then. Most animations in the game appear somewhat crude, but then again acceptable for it's age. It should run pretty good on today's laptops as a counter argument.AUDIOThe audio is nothing to be noted specifically, no orchestral scores. Just your standard background music with a few tension increasing tempos. The voice acting, including lip sync, is actually pretty good for the standard of those days. But the dialogs happen mostly during game, which can be very incomprehensible at times. However most of them are restricted to a lot of swearing and banter, so you won't miss much.MULTIPLAYERAs said the game can be played coop and it will be waaaay more fun when playing with some buddies, like with much of these coop games. Also the online versus mode is very original, especially with a name like Fragile Alliance, things can get interesting. You can view the tutorial and get an impression of what it would be like, but that's about it. Servers are dead, both coop and versus. So sadly I cannot divulge into this any further, but I can expect it would change my opinion of the game.VERDICTBuy it cheap if you want to experience the beginning of the franchise, but other than that just skip it and go straight to the next one. If you have enough friends who are willing to play it with you I would probably recommend this one for sure. Most coop games from previous generation are well worth it just for that.			"

												The game is like a 5/10 overall. Very short (on easy). Story feels like it has been bent to fit the levels rather than the other way around which isn't necessarily a bad thing... but the game is all over the place location wise. The first ~60% feels like your typical crime/mobster type of hollywood affair. [Location/mission spoilers]You've got your prison breaks, bank robberies, Heat rip-off and Nightclub scene.And then you fly to Cuba to assist in the liberation of Havana and follow it up with a set of jungle based guerilla warfare type missions. It feels like they took the alpha for Kane and Lynch and then glued it to some alpha concepts for a Freedom Fighters 2. And I say alpha because really the gameplay lets it down, not the mission concepts themselves. The cover system just doesn't seem to work, shooting feels meh, the squad/command system felt tacked on and so on. There is some cool tech behind it though - plenty of the missions are packed with enemies and civilians to make the world feel more real (and I assume this got used on the later Hitman). The characters themselves *could* have become something noteworthy in a Trevor/Michael GTAV sort of way, but they never really seem to go far with either of them. So yeah, it feels like the alpha of something that may have been great.			"

												This game is okay, and then it goes completely off the rails and throws you into a South American civil war, where it expects you to face off against literally dozens of soldiers at once while two helicopters are firing on you and your team (this is where I stopped playing). Also I had a weird bug with my mouse that kind of ruined the experience for me.I like the hook, and a couple of the missions are really awesome (Japanese Office, Bank Heist). It's better than the second one, but doesn't look as good and the gunplay isn't as fun. The squad system and grenades feel right, and I don't know why they didn't carry over to the sequel. Decent.

The game starts off fairly cinematic plot-wise, not revealing anything at the beginning but rather putting you right into the action without even properly knowing who you play as.You are intriguedThe game looks good even, the scenery is diverse, the graphics aren't bad, with terrific lighting at times and some of the best dynamic shadows I've seen in a game. I was especially aroused satisfied with the rain effects. Seldom I can say that..You are interestedAfter firing a handful of shots, you realize you don't have a friggin' clue why they included a crosshair to begin with.Soon you throw your first bouncy ball grenade. How on earth are you supposed to get it where you want to? ""Oh *@#~ too high. For ~#@+'? sake too low. Come on! Almost Yes!! It bounced back, RUN RUN RUN!""The emenies are balls too. It seems they hibernate until you are close enough, Just like some kind of LOD but for AI.You are infuriatedAt least the story is good. At first. Then it's a kind of a crescendo. It seems rushed the further you advance, As does the beautiful level design. It's less and less polished until the end of the game, the graphics seem downgrading themselves. LOD that is worse or even disappearing when close up? What is this sorcery? You are confusedYou realize some sound effects appear to be missing, like revving engines punches or even gunshots, forcing you to have the impression you should be paid to be playing this game, not because it may be bad, but because you have to do like 50 % of the sounds by yourself to at least create the illusion of immersion. Your mother walks in as you casually wet your mouth and produce warfare noise with your body's orifices, furiously trying to hit an emeny at the same time. She thinks you are regressing.You feel pity for yourselfThere are situations where you just keep dying. You are not particularly bad at this kind of games, but you can't help it. Choppers shoot you to death even though you have the impression to be safely hidden under a roof and behind a wall. Simultaneously. But hey it's a game, noone stated you could apply real life rules to this game. You know you can do it, you've come and suffered this far. The game isn't that long.You are angry motivatedYou finally make it. The ending seems as cut off and rash as it can, but you don't feel a thing, you stopped anticipating anything some time ago. You feel nothing. You feel entitled to write a review for this game. Entitled, not capable. All you can come up with is THIS.You feel like your mother was rightI recommend this game because it's not fair only I have to go through this agony. "

												The first mission of the game was decent. However, very rapidly things began to go downhill. The list of issues rapidly made the game unbalanced (and not in my favor). I often found targets not reacting to soaking up ammo, or finding enemies shooting through objects that my shots just bounced off of (such as cars, they could shoot through and I couldn't). Coupled with an awful control scheme, I could only recommend this game to my worst enemy: this game.			"

												While the series has a pretty bad reputation, I enjoyed it.The gameplay is meh, guns are more based on luck than accuracy (If theres one thing I love in third person shooters its first shot accuracy, and this doesnt have that, which bugs me), the story is allright, nothing special, it wont give you any satisfaction, though I think that may have been the intention of the developers (No matter what you do, you suck).However, being a bit of a heist nerd, I liked the heists and the general feel of everything but the last quarter of the game which puts you in some war in cuba or some ♥♥♥♥.Anyways, if you like street shootouts and killing lots of people, this is probably worth a try.

												It could have been great. It had great ugly anti heroes, good concept, and settings. But it has bad gunplay, poor level design, over used enemies, and uses ******* GFWL. It is also only 4 hours long, which is somewhat compensated by it's low price. 7/10 gets a buy with low expectations and low price. Last thing  you get to invade Cuba	 randomly which is cool.			"

												This is honestly one of the most boring and repititive games I've ever had the displeasure to play. If you have played any shooter game of the last decade, you have seen everything in this game. All you do is run-n-gun for the whole 4 hour campaign. I will give it a 3/10 only because the gameplay was polished and competent.			"

												Kane & Lynch: Dead Men is a third person shooter game with a few interesting twists, but ultimately the poor execution of some elements drag it down quite a bit.First off I've played this game a bit when it came out on Xbox, did a little bit of coop back then, but never finished it. It has been sitting in my Steam library for a while now until I recently decided to finish it. The game itself was released in a time where things were still good in the gaming business and companies churned out games at a fast pace. It was also a high time for Xbox and most relevantly coop was the thing every game needed to have.STORYThe game takes an interesting perspective from the bad guy who gets broken out of prison and is confronted with his past. Needless to say life as a mercenary is shady and he did some things his former employers couldn't agree with. His wife and daughter are leveraged and he is blackmailed into retrieving something. Beyond that the story gets rather predictive with failure and revenge as central pivoting points.GAMEPLAYAs said the game is a third person shooter and the controls handle a bit slow and rough, but when playing with the controller everything runs pretty good. Cover mechanics however are poorly done and for some reason you can only get in cover on the edge of a wall, even the lower ones. This is very frustrating since enemies are abundant and aim pretty good, even on the lowest difficulty. On the other hand most of your weapons have such low accuracy you really have to get very close to hit something. Result is that moving from cover to cover gets you killed most of the time, luckily your team-mates revive you almost every time.And that is pretty much the only thing they get right, other than that they're pretty useless. You have a few basic commands, but anything other than 'Stay here' or 'Come over' is pointless. You can order them to attack a specific target, but this just results in them rushing towards it and shooting them in the face with a shotgun. The animation however is pretty nice though. That's mostly the gameplay throughout the game, aside from a few vehicle missions.VISUALSThe game is a bit older, but it still looks acceptable, but nothing special. There is some destructibility, which was also very popular back then. Most animations in the game appear somewhat crude, but then again acceptable for it's age. It should run pretty good on today's laptops as a counter argument.AUDIOThe audio is nothing to be noted specifically, no orchestral scores. Just your standard background music with a few tension increasing tempos. The voice acting, including lip sync, is actually pretty good for the standard of those days. But the dialogs happen mostly during game, which can be very incomprehensible at times. However most of them are restricted to a lot of swearing and banter, so you won't miss much.MULTIPLAYERAs said the game can be played coop and it will be waaaay more fun when playing with some buddies, like with much of these coop games. Also the online versus mode is very original, especially with a name like Fragile Alliance, things can get interesting. You can view the tutorial and get an impression of what it would be like, but that's about it. Servers are dead, both coop and versus. So sadly I cannot divulge into this any further, but I can expect it would change my opinion of the game.VERDICTBuy it cheap if you want to experience the beginning of the franchise, but other than that just skip it and go straight to the next one. If you have enough friends who are willing to play it with you I would probably recommend this one for sure. Most coop games from previous generation are well worth it just for that.			"

												This is a highly under-rated game and I highly recommend playing it despite the multiplayer being completely dead. I bought this game the year it came out on Xbox 360 even after multiple friends had given me bad reviews on it. Instead of putting this one up on the shelf to collect dust, I played through the campaign multiple times, and again even with friends and family. The CO-OP is a blast, and I really enjoyed the multiplayer as it was around. The multiplayer was quite comparable to the PayDay franchise, except that there was a twist; as you tried to rob the location with your fellow team they as well as yourself had the option to betray eachother. The winner took all, or if you did decide to work together you got to split the money. The multiplayer was short and sweet, but because you could not do much with the money, or beyond the level of customization it seemed to quickly face it's demize. Although multiplayer is now dead, the gameplay and story still make this an enjoying title for the price. If you have ever played the 2006 Reservoir Dogs or even have played PayDay 1 or 2, you are in for a similar experience. As Multiplayer gaming dominates the market, this franchise is one of the last I have seen with a truly CO-OP experience. Pick this game up... You cannot go wrong for the price!			"

												I owned this for PS3 and I enjoyed it very much, its not underated at all because it sold over 1 million copies. My main issue is that the game on PC DOES NOT F*CKING WORK!!!! I tried literally everything. If you have Windows 8.1 do not buy this. As for windows 7 users you are good to go. The game is extremely fun until you get to the Havana level (F*CK THAT MISSION!!!). Soundtrack is great, graphics were good for its time, gameplay is meh but tolerable and its way superior over its sequel. I would love this game even more if you could play online co-op with a friend but its only splitscreen (To be fair it came out in 2007, 8yrs ago). Back when the community was alive the multiplayer heist game mode was really enjoyable but sadly the community is dead. If you were buying for a multiplayer experience don't bother Verdict: 7.5/10 Again, DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS 8.1 (F*cking Microsoft forcing bull-sh*t down my neck)			"

												Only to be recommended if you want to have a good time with a friend. There are some hilarious moments to be experienced (e.g. scripted police cars arriving at full speed and colliding with their own people who happen to walk there). Apart from a short (less than five hours on hardest difficulty), mediocre co-op experience, there is not much more to be had in this game.			"

												I bought this as part of a Humble Bundle and finally got around to giving it a go. This game had a lot of potential. I enjoy games that involve ordering party members during combat. At times it felt a bit like their previous title Freedom Fighters. However, the nostalgia factor wasn't enough. You'll get 4-5 hours out of this game. The cover mechanics are just awful. Even if you do manage to stick to a wall the enemies can shoot through it. Co-op is local only. Microsoft DRM was a pain as I had to uninstall and reinstall manually from another source. At the start of the game (tutorial level) they showed you how to give someone a gun from your inventory but this ability was never required/benficial. The story was very weak. Anyway, you get the picture. I recommend you give this a skip.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Kane and Lynch: Dead Men is a game developed by IO Interactive and published by Eidos InteractiveThe characters are what really sold me in this mediocre action game. Unlike other series in which you play as ""bad guys"" who ultimately tend to do the right thing, Kane and Lynch are 100% scumbagsKane is a self-serving, traitorous sociopath and Lynch is just completely mental. It's a real treat to see how they interact with each other and how their personalities affect the storyline.The combat is good, not great. The cover system is a little wonky and the AI is outright terrible at times, but I was always having enough fun that these issues didn't bother me much. Shooting feels off at first, but as you progress and get a feel for the weapons, it becomes a total joy You really get the feel of desperation that would accompany a heist gone wrong leading into a frantic shootout with the copsThe graphics are pretty mediocre, and look like what you'd expect from a non AAA game title in 2007. That being said, the levels you play in are more than interesting enough to make up for itYou'll go from banks and upscale office buildings to the streets and rooftops of Tokyo to Havana in the middle of a political revolutionOverall, this is a solid game with a few flaws that stand out, but definitely won't ruin the experience of playing as such interesting characters in such interesting situations. And for only 6.99EUR, you can't go wrong giving it a try! RECOMMENDED :)  "

												One of my favorite Multiplayer games. The Singleplayer/Coop is really good too. The story was entertaining, and the whole ""He's your partner in the game, but not someone you should trust"" thing is executed very well. In the Multiplayer you rob banks/stores/etc. with your buddies, while also watching your back. At any time someone can kill you, become a traitor, and take your cash and run the hell out of there before your other buddies go after him. Really fun!			"

												i bought this after loving it on the 360 but its such a horrid buggy port on the pc. basically unplayable gameplay wise. what was forgivable and neglectable on console really sticks out like a sore thumb on pc. 1 glitch in 3 years on console, died several times due bad melee detection, during the bank chase scene a policecar rammed through the van and incapped lynch, being stuck in a 'railshooter segment' he died and failed, got shot through walls and more. dont buy this, even on sale...

												Great story, not so great gameplay. This game you should consider if you only want a good story, as this game's gameplay mechanics are clearly broken. The story in itself is worth playing for, but just be noted that this is not a great game in gameplay respect.			"

												After having played the entirety of this game with a co-op partner, I can hopefully give a helpful review of Kane and Lynch: Dead Men. First of all, lets start with the pros. There's not many of them. The voice acting was tolerable, especially the titular characters, however, there were a few side characters that were just meh.The save point system is great. If you or a teammate dies (and you will, more on this later), it almost always starts you at the point just before you died.The character exploration was fairly limited, but what little backstory you learn of Kane and Lynch is somewhat interesting, even though it never really gets used in the story. And thats it. Now for the cons...The story is abysmal. The loosely connected missions barely have anything to do with each other outside of verbal descriptions between scenes with no visual guidance. It really has a way of disconnecting you from the story. There's no gearing up for anything, it's just a ""we have to do this to get that"" and boom, you're doing it.  This is more of a gripe than anything, but vertical split screen on a shooter means you will be killed by enemies you run right past because you couldn't see them. Im sure in single player theres not much of an issue but on co op we both died multiple times because of it.The controls are fairly awful on a Xbox 360 gamepad. The shooting feels imprecise, always accelerating just beyond your target. Normally you could just move the left stick a little to compensate, but the cover system, which automatically forces you into cover, will cause you to lose the shot. It's just sloppy all around. All in all, it was a decent co-op game. But if I had to play this alone I probably never would have finished it. I would not recommend this game, but if you really must get it, do yourself a favor and wait for it to go on sale. It's not worth more than three bucks. If you don't have anyone to play this with, then skip it altogether.			"

												I only heard of this game on its negative reputation at first, but i decided to get it after i started gaining a love for games where you play the villian. And after playing it, this is one of my fav vilians games ever. These two men are some of the scum of the earth, yet their interactions, the turning story, and some of the most ballsy storytelling ive ever seen in a video game realy rate this one highly for me. THe AI stupidity is never too stupid to get in the way once your used to it (its best ot just let them do their own thing and not command them) the odd camera angles at times, and... well i cant realy think of antoher issue actualy, this is truly and underrated game and one id recomend to any fan of villians, if you cant stand playing the villian, then you probably wont like this, but id still say give it a chance, its a GREAT game ^^			"

Two Psychopaths have the worst day of their live.This game is way superior to its Sequel, which killed the whole IP, and playtime of this game is quite decent, too, with lots of different (and interesting!) settings and ideas. (Unlike its much hated sequel, thats why I´m pointing it out)Gameplay is simple, not breathtaking, but enjoyable.At the core this game is simple Cover-Shooter, and the cover system here takes some getting used to. The main selling point for this game are its two Unique Main Characters. Kane is a former failed mercenary, now a broken man and kind of an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and Lynch is a medicated Psychopath, who is incredibly whiny at times. Seeing those two interact with each other is quite fun, as they´re both having to deal with a lot of frustration potential and keep ♥♥♥♥ing up and yelling at each other and sometimes there like an old married couple, and yeah, its fun.The story of this one is actually quite good too, I felt entertained.Multiplayer probably was realy cool at one point, I doubt anyone still plays though.Theres Local Co-op though, if you have an Xbox Gamepad (or an emulator), which is always good fun, and I wish more modern games have.Graphics, uuhm well, they definitly look their age. It´s not an ugly game at all, you just see it has aged a bit.			"

												If I could, I would give this game a ""sideways thumb"".Kane and Lynch is an odd game. For every good idea it has, there is an equally bad idea to balance it out. As the title suggests, the game is about Kane and Lynch, two mercenaries trying to get revenge on a mercenary group they used to work for. This plays out in typical third-person shooter fashion, with genre standards like cover system, squad mates, etc.The gameplay is a mixed bag. The guns themselves feel and sound punchy when they hit what you're aiming at, but all of them are almost comically short ranged, making for an odd combat dynamic. It's not particularly bad, mind you, but it did feel like I was running out into the open more often than what was sensible. Speaking of running out into the open, this game's cover system is completely broken. You're sort of supposed to push yourself up against whatever you want to duck behind, but I can count the number of times that actually worked right on two fingers. It's easier to just stand or crouch behind whatever you're trying to hide behind than to mess with this game's broken attempt at cover. The game also has some weird design choices, for example, the tutorial is actually in the second level, after you've spent an entire level shooting your way through enemies. The problem is, that first level doesn't give you any kind of instruction on what button to press when it wants you to do things like go into cover or climb onto something, so for that level, you're constantly checking the options menu to find out what button you're supposed to press, only to have the game try and teach you after you spent all that time trying to figure things out on your own. The one thing this game does to genuinely well is the squad system. It's fairly standard, you tell teammates where to guard, what to shoot, whether to hang back, but it's useful and works well. I also have to commend the game's inclusion of split-screen co-op. I haven't played this mode myself, but it's fairly rare to see split-screen on a PC shooter, so I respect its inclusion. Overall, the gameplay is odd, and broken in places, but it's playable and even has bursts of ""hey, this is cool""The graphics are another example of how this game is all over the place. It came out in 2007, so looking a bit dated is excusable, but this looks like it got trapped in a sort of awkward tranitionary period between PS2 era graphics and Xbox 360-era graphics, something more akin to a game from 2004. Other games from 2007, such as Call of Duty 4 and The Orange Box were much more consistent and generally looked a lot better than this game does. The characters themselves look decent, except when beards (which look terrible in this game) are involved, featuring reasonably modern graphics techniques such as normal maps and whatnot (basically, the old wrinkly people you play as look old and wrinkly), but props and environments (including weapons), look like something from a PS2-era game, blocky and angular, with basic, low-resolution textures. Outdoor environments actually look fairly decent, being reasonably large and detailed, with good use of color and decent lighting, but indoor areas have a barren, almost abandoned feeling. This would be fine if you were supposed to be going through abandoned areas, but this game sends you through heavily populated areas such as banks and nightclubs, making these segments of the game feel odd and empty, and failing to convince me that I'm moving through and actual world. The buildings feel like they were just constructed and no one moved in yet, devoid of many of the props you would see in other games. One cool graphical thing this game does have going for it is that it features absolutely massive crowds. There are tons of people in places like the aforementioned nightclub, and they move out of your way and react in a surprisingly convincing way.Finally, let's talk about the storyline. I just could not care about this story or any of the people in it. It's cool that you get to play as an unambiguously bad set of characters, but the storytelling is poorly executed. Basically the group of assassins Kane and Lynch worked is trying to get back the money they think Kane took. When Kane fails to get the cash, they do a bad thing (I won't spoil what on the off chance someone actually cares), so Kane and Lynch try to get their revenge. It's an interesting setup, but none of the characters are ever fleshed out enough to make me want to care. The past relationship between Kane and the group isn't explained much, so their rivalry fails to be interesting, and neither Kane nor Lynch are interesting enough for me tor really latch on to either. You can have an interesting story about a complete amoral character (The recent film, ""Nightcrawler"" is an excellent example), but that's not the case here. Every character is kind of an idiot, and the worsening of their problems is always their own fault, making them more annoying than cool. You eventually pick up three side characters who serve as your ""squad"", and while their gameplay function is interesting, they serve almost no purpose to the story, and are basically nothing more than names. Their relation to Kane and Lynch is never explained and other than one or two offhand lines, they get no characterization other than ""unpleasant"". The game wants to be a Michael Mann crime revenge story, but has neither the style nor charm to do so.Overall, it's not a terrible game, but it's not particularly great either. It's certainly not worth the $7 price being asked, but if you can get it for $1.25 (which it drops to frequently), it's not the worst thing you could play. The game lasts about 6 hours, so it's okay as a ""weekend game"" that you can beat and forget about.[Note: I've previously posted this review on Amazon]			"

												I read the bad reviews before playing, yes, but I tried to play it without negative predisposition and I think I succeeded; it is utterly independent and coherent that the outcome is the same.You press play. The game starts off fairly cinematic plot-wise, not revealing anything at the beginning but rather putting you right into the action without even properly knowing who you play as.You are intriguedThe game looks good even, the scenery is diverse, the graphics aren't bad, with terrific lighting at times and some of the best dynamic shadows I've seen in a game. I was especially aroused satisfied with the rain effects. Seldom I can say that..You are interestedAfter firing a handful of shots, you realize you don't have a friggin' clue why they included a crosshair to begin with.Soon you throw your first bouncy ball grenade. How on earth are you supposed to get it where you want to? ""Oh *@#~ too high. For ~#@+'? sake too low. Come on! Almost Yes!! It bounced back, RUN RUN RUN!""The emenies are balls too. It seems they hibernate until you are close enough, Just like some kind of LOD but for AI.You are infuriatedAt least the story is good. At first. Then it's a kind of a crescendo. It seems rushed the further you advance, As does the beautiful level design. It's less and less polished until the end of the game, the graphics seem downgrading themselves. LOD that is worse or even disappearing when close up? What is this sorcery? You are confusedYou realize some sound effects appear to be missing, like revving engines punches or even gunshots, forcing you to have the impression you should be paid to be playing this game, not because it may be bad, but because you have to do like 50 % of the sounds by yourself to at least create the illusion of immersion. Your mother walks in as you casually wet your mouth and produce warfare noise with your body's orifices, furiously trying to hit an emeny at the same time. She thinks you are regressing.You feel pity for yourselfThere are situations where you just keep dying. You are not particularly bad at this kind of games, but you can't help it. Choppers shoot you to death even though you have the impression to be safely hidden under a roof and behind a wall. Simultaneously. But hey it's a game, noone stated you could apply real life rules to this game. You know you can do it, you've come and suffered this far. The game isn't that long.You are angry motivatedYou finally make it. The ending seems as cut off and rash as it can, but you don't feel a thing, you stopped anticipating anything some time ago. You feel nothing. You feel entitled to write a review for this game. Entitled, not capable. All you can come up with is THIS.You feel like your mother was rightI recommend this game because it's not fair only I have to go through this agony. "

												This game got very mixed reviews but I found it to be good fun and enjoyable to play when it first came out. I bought this game on release date and played for at least 50 hours of SP and MP. When I noticed this game on sale I immediatly bought it at the sale price of £1.24 and was excited to play it again however the game would not run properly. I was only ever getting 2fps at most when a level had loaded up. My pc is an i7 4790K with a GTX970 but for some reason the game would not run when doing a level. The menu screen loaded fine and was flawless, even showing 3000fps on the steam counter, but as soon as you try to play the game it was impossible. I am still recommending this game because I had a good time playing it back when it was first released and just because my computer won't run it does not mean someone elses won't. My advice is to buy it at the cheap price its at, test it to see if it works and if it doesn't do a steam refund (as long as you are under 2 hours). If it works, go have a good 5 hours play time for a very cheap price.			"

I'm 3 hours in and I noticed a few audio glitches. The AI can be stupid at times and the camera can be annoying. However, the story is better than Dog Days and I love how it doesn't have the camera effects. However, multiplayer is uplayable because Windows Live is no longer active. The nostalgia is worth it on sale and you have to have patience while setting this up. You need Windows XP in order to play this or else you get 1 fps. 0/10			"
