												My hours. help.I wrote something for real!These hours are legit, I played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life. I was young and didn't really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and I had a really bad pc, which i still own. TF2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics, but it was one of the more fun games I installed. I met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side. The community back then was more humble compared to nowadays. You have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunny/gross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game. When really, it doesn't even matter if you win or lose.  However, you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way! Although you never know what kinda person you're going to meet on this game. In my honest opinion, if you want to have a game to just waste time on (and money) or just mess around with people you know (which is what I do now), this is perfect. Esspecially the mann vs. machine co-op. I mainly play that now. Although to me, the game lost its touch, update wise, and I moved onto other games. I believe it's worth a shot to try it out but other than that, I'd keep it as a casual game. I don't think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because it's being flooded by crude people. Atleast from my experiance after over about 4+ years of playing it just got worse and worse. You will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it. You'll be more stressed than actually having fun, I'll tell you that!Although in all seriousness, this game is losing its touch and probably isn't worth making it your main game MAINLY because the updates they've been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be. BUT, it's a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun! All you'll really notice nowdays is...people really love to trade more than actually play. Living off as a free to play would be very tough and you'd need to be patient with items you would want, unless you got that MONEY! Hope this helps.One last thing, I am not saying this game is bad in any way. I am saying that it's worth trying and playing with friends, or even meeting people! Although there are some downsides that you won't like, such as some stuff I pointed out above. Strictly towards the community. I personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing. Have it as a once in a while game, because it's nothing to be big about, unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there. Just give it a shot and see what you think! Have fun <3			"

 This is the cycle of every  Team Fortress 2  player ever: > Download the game.> Enter your first match.> Realize you don't know what you're doing.> Die repeatedly.> Just before you rage, you find the Ghastly Gibus hat.> Since all the pro players have cool-looking hats, you are inspired.> Die repeatedly in different game modes.> Discover that you are getting a lot of kills as Pyro.> Be mentally violated by other players calling you a ""f2p gibus pyro"".> Get slightly better at the game.> Die repeatedly.> Leave the game.*6 months later.*> Start to discover TF2 videos on YouTube.> Realize that there are more classes than just Pyro and Sniper.> End up wanting to be a pro non-Pyro like all the cool YouTubers.> Return to Team Fortress 2.> Die repeatedly.> Claim that you 'main' Pyro.> Walk at people and light them on fire mindlessly for a few weeks. Or months.> Start getting a good K/D ratio on a different class. (If it's Soldier, you can go die.)> Succumb to peer-pressure and buy hats.> Discover the Steam community market and buy more hats for less.> Feel your skill strangely growing as you get more hats.> More kills. Less deaths.> You begin to discover the passive players of TF2. (Sandvich hoovies, spycrabs, box shpees, etc.)> Develop a kindness and sense of friendship towards your fellow TF2 players.> Start to top-score more often.> You begin to care about the state of the game.> Realize that Pyros are overpowered and pointless.> Start to hate Pyros.> Start to hate everyone.> Start to hate the TF2 community.> You hate everything and everyone, to the point where you start to kill passive players again.> Ask yourself, ""If I hate this game, why do I have ten unusuals and fifteen Australiums? What am I doing?""> Look at your playtime and begin to hate yourself.> You dislike yourself more than the game now.> Contemplate suicide.> Contemplate religion.> Question the game.> Binge-watch STAR_'s 2012-2013 TF2 videos to remind you of a simpler time.> Sit down and think.> Realize what you have become.> Go into a mid-TF2 crisis.> Except it's not mid-TF2 anymore. You have 1000 hours in-game.> What is going on?> WHAT IS TEAM FORTRESS 2?> WHY DOES THE LIGHT LIE TO ME?> Quit TF2 forever.> Come back to it in a week and die to a gibus sniper who taunts after kill.> Kill yourself.Or maybe that was just my experience.Oh well.10/10			"

												The vicious cycle of Team fortress 2First when you'll arrive in the game, you'll want Weapons, tons of them.Then you'll see that everyone has hats, and you'll want these, a tons of them.Then you'll realize that hats doesn't matter, only skill count, so you'll want a lot of skills, tons of them.Then new weapons will be added, and you'll want them, all of them.Then a new hat will be added and you'll want it, cause it'll be fancy on your main class.Then you'll realize again, that you don't give a damn about hats, all is about is skill.Then when you have waited for 3 years, new weapons will be added, and you'll want them.And then you realize that you spent  like 2000 hours of your life for this, met great friends, and you'll have a server where's you feeling like home, and you discovered so much things via the community, it learnt you so much.Then the rude reality of life, bring you on earth, and this game is here, Waiting for you to play 1,2,3... hours, and you'll be happy to see that all your good friend are still there.

												Team Fortress 2 is the most realistic hat simulator created to date. There is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one. The first time you start the simulator, you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items. If you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame, you get your very first hat: the Gibus. This is where it really starts; To play the simulator correctly, you have to spend money in the market place, made by Valve. After that, while you play the minigame, you can find hats which you can trade for, or collect! There is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats, just like you! After you collect enough items and/or hats, try joining a trade server! There, the REAL fun begins! Good luck, and beware of ending up poor!			"

												Team Fortress 2. Being ranked as the third most-played game[steamcharts.com] on Steam, Team Fortress 2 is probably one of the best free-to-play games we've got.Why is it so popular? Let's take a look, shall we?First off, the obvious: It's free. 100% free. This means its accessible to everyone on Steam. This is just the icing on the cake though. What really shines about TF2 is the game itself.Team Fortress 2 usually consists of two teams (Red and Blue) going head to head against each other. Sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other. There are many, many maps and modes, such as Payload, Capture Points, and Mann VS Machine. But the general idea no matter the map or mode is to KILL EVERYTHING THAT MOVES! And my god, is it fun to do so. The game has 9 playable mercenaries, each actually being a certain ""class"". Each class is divided into 3 different roles: Offense, Defense, and Support. Let's go over each role and class.Offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team. These are your main attack force. Scouts are the speedy hit and run class, with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items. Soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers, which gives them not only power, but mobility due to the ability known as ""rocket jumping"". The Pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire, as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast. Defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map. Overall, the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups. Demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by. Heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces. Heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off. Engineers can build Sentry Guns for effective area defense, as well as build Teleporters and Dispensers for logistical support of the team.Support classes cannot hold the fight on their own, but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their team's favor. They offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game. Whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed, the support classes are always handy to have around. Medics are the team healers, capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments. Spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats. Snipers excel at long range, also eliminating key threats, as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates.Next, let's look at the presentation.TF2 has a very unqiue art style. It's somewhat cartoonish, but very appealing. It's simple, and un-complex. But it doesn't need to be complex. It's simplicity is it's strength. Everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on, what a specific model or item is, and they all stand out. The soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy, especially the main theme. I personally have it as a ringtone/alarm tone on my smartphone! :)One of the best aspects of TF2 is the Steam Workshop. Users can submit designs for items and weapons, and possibly have them added to the game! A very lucrative sub-market has also emerged from this game in the form of the Crate Keys. That's a whole different ballgame in and of itself, so we won't get into it here. During normal gameplay on most servers, you can obtain random items, weapons, and sometimes crates, and taunts....through the item drops system. You can only receive so many drops per week, and you will get them randomly as you play. You can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenary's loadout, or you can use them to craft other items, hats, and weapons. You can take multiples of items and craft them into Scrap, then Reclaimed Metal, then Refined Metal. You can then use these metals to craft specific class weapons/items, among other things. The crafting system is simple yet robust, with lots of possibilities. Some of it is very luck based. You can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the Steam Market!All-in-all, Team Fortress 2 is just a very fun game. Endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game, especially if you play with friends on your favorite server. Probably the best free-to-play game on Steam.

												I think Jerma summed up this game pretty nicely...""Maybe you got like two Pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago. They don't have any hats, they're spraying ♥♥♥♥ and they're having a blast. They might even be at the wrong point. They might be going backwards to the point that's already been capped. On the same team, there's a Scout with a Hale's Own Scattergun. He's got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak, he just got 18. He's going 'I just got 18, sick!' He runs up the stairs, he's trying his ♥♥♥ off. He's get *beeping noises* dodging the 'Oh, the sentry almost got me!' He looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on Gorge and there's two sandwich Heavies having a ♥♥♥♥ing picnic. So he stops for a second and goes, 'Two... nnnggh!' so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldier's rocket next door......The two sandwich Heavies then decide to move their picnic. There's ants. 'There's ants here, honey. I wanna get out of here.' So they get up, they pack their sandwiches, pack up their lunches, and their breakfast, and whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they're eating. They get up and walk toward the door to go to RED because they think, 'That spot near the A point for RED is pretty good.' They walk out the door, and they see four Level 3 Sentry Guns pointing at them. They get shot a million times and blow up, and there's like nine Engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions.The BLU Scout, at this point, respawns, and walks by the at least 3-4 statues because we all know there's four people AFK when you play this game, you go by the museum of people standing still. He walks out the door and readies his weapon, he's ready, 'I'm going to get another 20 killstreak, just you watch Gaben, I'm going to praise Gaben!' And he goes forward and starts shooting, and he gets backstabbed by a Spy that has been sitting with the Cloak and Dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds.""Normally when I do reviews, I turn into a critic and start to examine that game, pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score. However, Team Fortress 2 (or TF2 for short) helped me make so many memories that if I actually tried to make a fair review on it, it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review.Team Fortress 2, is, obviously, an amazing game. The teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult. You need teammates in order to survive and win. The graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game.I'm not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot.I love this game because of its charm.The game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters, you can't help to love all of them at some point. Scout is cocky and overconfident. Spy, another one of the characters in the game, is technically Scout's father. Soldier is a crazed WWII American patriot. He never actually joined the Army, but instead, he had his own personal Nazi killing spree. His roommate was a magician named Merasmus, who grew to hate Soldier. Pyro is mysterious, but portrays the world as one big happy paradise, known as Pyroland. Demoman is a Scottish alcoholic who, due to Merasmus, lost his eye that is now haunted. Heavy, although he appears to be dim-witted, is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters. Engineer is very intelligent as well, and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with RED and BLU continue. Medic isn't fond of normal forms of medicine, but is still an important member nonetheless. Sniper is from New Zealand, but was raised in Australia. He prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to Superman's. Spy is the master of disguise, and is technically Scout's father, as said before. Of all the characters, he appears to be the most ""mature"" and appears to be the ringleader at many times.Not only that, but the game has an interesting story. I would not like to get too detailed with it. However, it makes little to no sense but is still funny, engaging, and gives TF2 much more depth. There is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where Mann Co. is being attacked, so the mercenaries have to defend it, called Mann vs. Machine. This game mode ties in with the TF comics, which explain many characters' backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review. The other comics (all of which can be found on TF2's official website) are all funny and charming in their own way as well.The community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times, but in the end, it's still an overall great community. I've seen people give out stuff, others mentor some of the newbs (something I do as well) along with much, much more.Yes. the game is considered a ""pay-to-win game"" but it isn't necessarily a pay-to-win game. With lots of patience, you will get what you want from the game, whether it be hats, weapons, or whatever it is you want. The game has a learning curve that isn't too steep, but become dedicated and you'll fall in love with it.No matter how many times you rage to a W+M1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak, or cheer when you unbox an Unusual, or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things, Team Fortress 2 has been a huge part of my PC gaming life and without it, I would be as bored as hell. I cannot recommend this game enough, and I hope that many more memories are made on here. Valve may be cash cows, but you can't help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games. Portal, Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike, but this game stands out from the rest to me.Do I recommend this game? Yes, yes, yes, YES.			"

												Into 2010, I learned of a game called The Orange Box. I was a filthy console peasant at the time who only played games for achievements. I booted it up on my Xbox 360 and didn't get what I expected. I thought of games such as portal and half life like stupid creations. I saw that they were probably some of the best games I've ever played in my lifetime. I was dumbstruck with how I could have missed these games for 3 years. After finishing portal, I played Team Fortress 2. From what I learned, It was an xbox live only game. I was disgruntled and I thought it was a bad game.1 month later, I got xbox live 12 month card so I could watch netflix for as long as I pleased. I suddenly remembered The Orange Box. Out of curiosity, I played a match of 2fort (the xbox 360 version is still not updated to this day and still has 5 maps.) I was bewildered by its gameplay, and intrigued by its cartoonish graphics. I stopped being a COD fanboy due to this game. I remember my first kill was between me and another scout, as we swung baseball bats.I played it for a long, LONG time. In 2011 I learned of Steam. I realized it was made by the company that made TOB. Estatic, I downloaded it on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC, not caring if it was a virus or not. I would later then learn this was a F2P game. I would be lieing if I told that I hadn't just about ♥♥♥♥ my pants about all the content in it. Although my PC lagged like a ♥♥♥♥♥, I played it in amazement from how different it is, so I sold my Xbox 360. I got a better PC and kept on playing.I soon used the real purpose of steam and played Hotline Miami, POSTAL 2, The Binding of Isaac, etc. But I always came back to this. Soon I had logged 4000+ hours into this game. I lost my skills from this game and had also lost interest in this game since all Valve focused on was the HORSE♥♥♥♥ING SHITEATING ♥♥♥♥♥ SNIFFING ♥♥♥♥ ROBBING COW HUMPING BULL♥♥♥♥COCKADOOKIE games known as DOTA 2 and CS:GO. I still miss the days when this game would be constantly focused on by Valve.In the end, I quit TF2. I still love this game and always will, but it hurts to see it barely updated with the exception of patches. I had the dream of reaching for an unusual flaming teams captain, but I failed at trading and it was impossible for me to find good deals. A friend I have who started TF2 a year ago mastered the game in 100 hours. He gained 3 unusuals during his first 100-600 hours when it took me more than 3600. I am going to give him all of my valueable items. So in the end I want to go back to doing what I love, and its to playing many games.Overall, I give this a game a perfect 10/10, and I'm not being sarcastic. This game changed my taste in all games, and I love it for that. This is why I recommend this game.			"

												This is a well made, stylized, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play. Lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes (each with his own distinct personality) to choose from. The banter between the different classes is entertaining to listen to. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow him to fulfill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or higher skill levels. The game has an active dev team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons or game modes.At the time of this review, there are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'.Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objective or objectives for each team to achieve.'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, ""Mann Up"", gives rewards upon completing a ""tour"".In addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available.In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them.The game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play. I have been playing since November 2007 and I still return to the game on a regular basis.			"

Both the co-op and the versus modes are incredibly fun and unique in their one way.

												You can role-play an obese russian hat hoarder who has mental issue from his psychopathic war experiences. He has a speach impairment and can't prenounce sandwich and calls it ""sandvich"" whenever he eat 1 of his 12 a day. Also a crazy nazi scientist who is still mad about WW2 follows you around with a gun-thing that I'm sure gives you testicular cancer. 10/10 would recommend.			"

												Last Revision: 09/29/16This update in a nutshell[i0.kym-cdn.com]Recent UpdateEdit 5: After over 2 months Valve finally added in a ""stay in the damn game I queued 5 minutes for"" option. Sadly, the community has become very conditioned by the previous, garbage system into leaving the match as soon as it is over. Gone are the days that you could marathon a map.Note: Valve has claimed that they will fix some of the issues below; however, until they are actually fixed, they will remain on this review.IntroI have played TF2 for close to 7 years. Over this time I have seen many improvements and many steps backwards. As of today, 7/8/16, Valve managed to kill some of the best portions of the game in order to try and compete with recent other games (Overwatch). Lets go over some  things.Awful Stuff Quickplay has been replaced with ""Casual"" game modes. There is no more quickplay. You MUST queue to play on a Valve server. You can not join them from the server browser. Best load a YouTube vid or two because you will be waiting for a while if you like to play alternative gamemodes. You can't queue in the background... You must sit and stare at the queue screen. Why in the world can we not queue and then mess with our loadout? There is a purely cosmetic ranking system in ""Casual"". There is NO incentive for ranking up. Like at all. If you are going to add a ranking system, make ranks actually reward you with item drops or something. The implementation is lacking. The server browser is and always has been trash. The thing is over a decade old and no improvements have been made. After giving us a better system (quickplay) then abruptly removing it, the browser feels even worse. There is no reliable way to find a quick pickup game where you won't be spammed with dozens of forced adverts,all-talk , donor perks, plug-ins, or terrible admins (I'm looking at you Skial and Pinion servers) I've been matched in lobbies where my ping is over 150. After queuing for over 15 minutes, that is an absolute disappointment. I never thought I'd complain about this,  but the removal of autobalance is tragic. Many times, people disconnect and screw their teammates. Playing 12 vs 8 payload is not enjoyable. Getting steamrolled repeatedly is incredibly frustrating. As of right now the ""TF2 Game Coordinator"" is pretty trash about balancing teams. The teamstack is real. You can't play ctf_well, ctf_sawmill, and ctf_2fort_invasion in casual mode. I'm mostly baffled as to why they removed sawmill. The only supported competitive mode is 6v6. The Righteous Bison used to do more damage to enemies that were moving away from you. This was touted as a feature in the game hints. When the MyM update dropped, Valve removed this and called it a bug.[i.imgur.com] The Pyro's hit registration is still broken. How can you have a Heavy vs Pyro update when one class can't reliably deal damage with their primary? I hope you like hackers because they are crawling out of the walls. Some of the highest ranked competitive players are well known hackers and they still have not been banned. The performance feels like it has gotten worse. This game is horridly unoptimized. You'll drop frames faster than the housing market crash!Fixed Stuff- Viewmodel FOV resets to a nauseating 54 degrees on first bootTook them half a month to fix something that was previously in the game. ""Valve time""- You are penalized for leaving a CASUAL game. (How does that make sense?)- You can NOT pick what map you wish to play on in ""Casual- You may NOT pick which game mode you wish to play on in ""Casual""- Queues to get into a ""Casual"" game are 30 minutes long on averageQueues are getting better, I've gotten into a few games with 5 minute waits. Good luck trying to queue into an obscure game type though...- There is no way to kick hackers or idlers from ""casual"" games- You can't play multiple matches without disconnecting and requeuing. Who thought this was a good idea? It took 2 months to fix this. 2 months.Stuff that isn't crap New ""minimized viewmodel"" mode is quite spiffy If you get disconnected from a game by crashing or losing internet, upon rebooting the game will prompt you to rejoin the game you dropped from You can queue with friends.SummaryWould I recommend this game in its current state? No. It is not as accessible or fun as it used to be. Competitive should have been an addition, not a replacement for the existing structure. TF2 was never about winning, it was about fun, and much of that has been lost in this pseudo-competitive environment that was thrust upon us.I adore TF2. It used to be a fun, absurd hat-based combat simulator. It no longer feels like that.But hey, it's free...Old EditsEdit: Let's hope that I can continue to cross things off this list.Edit 2: The issue remains that around 2 years ago, the Quickplay update killed off many community servers. Quickplay allowed new users to QUICKLY find a game on the map they desired and enjoy a no-hassle, vanilla experience. This new update has made finding a game a pain. It is clunky, and far from the ""upgrade"" that Valve toted. If you do not wish to play the ""Casual"" game mode, you must comb through piles of crap servers to try and find one without annoying adverts, plugins, and abusive mods. Good luck finding ones that aren't running stupid cp_Orange_x3 (I hate that map). Valve has made a blog post mentioning that they will change certain aspects, but until the issues are fixed, the vanilla experience is not as accessible to new players or enjoyable to long-time veterans. Edit 3: Updated review. Quit groaning that I do not spend every waking moment updating this crap. I'll update it at my leisure.Edit 4: Changed bulletpoint format as it would not appear properly on the preview.			"

												In a land a long, long time ago, Team Fortress 2 would be a critically acclaimed first person shooter. Boasting its colorful characters against the dreary palette of the Badlands, this game offered to many a wonderful experience. Later updates would add cosmetics, weapons, and a ton of other things to sink your teeth into. Some of those updates are not as well viewed by the community as others, like the addition of crazier and crazier hats. In recent years, the community has felt somewhat negatively towards the team of developers and their updates for this game. Though, there is something important to remember.We first saw those deranged mercenaries nearly ten years ago! This game has been alive and kicking for a long time, and I doubt that you will soon see a day where these nine mercs aren't defying laws of physics, common sense, and sometimes all laws in general. You won't find many other games with a soviet in love with a 300 pound minigun who he just lugs around like it's nothing. Nor will you find a quick-witted, caffeine-fueled Bostonian who dances around the battlefield, dodging rockets and bullets like a madman. This game is very outlandish, and incredibly enjoyable. Even after years and years of pushing a payload down a track to blow up the enemies... people want to come back, because although there's some basis and objectives for the game modes, you never play the same game twice. Every match is a total surprise. Even competitively, the 9 classes and variety in what you can play with, it will give you a new experience almost every time you play.Years of pushing a cart filled to the brim with explosives is a hard task. Thankfully, there are new faces, hats to wear, weapons to try, and a new experience to be had every single day.			"

												I've been playing Team fortress 2 Since the good ol' days before it became free to play, (I started back in 2nd february, 2010). Team fortress 2 has since then managed to come a long way while still holding the title as best free to play game.Why would i recommend this game to anyone?, Well, I really don't know where to begin.I've been spending alot of my life playing Team fotress 2, apparently over 4000 hours on it.Ever since i got the game, i've been making tons of new friends from the casual servers as well as some of them friendly community servers. I tend to group up with my friends alot and have some fun within the casual and community servers.The graphics of the game are simple, yet unique at the same time.Team Fortress 2 has an OST made by a wide arrange of people.Team fortress 2 also has a giant range of mods for people who like to try out a different experience in their games as well as the steam workshop support which allows the great big community of Team fortress 2 to also submit their creativity towards the game, Whether it comes in an Weapon, a hat, a Taunt, unusual effects or even maps as well. It's amazing to see the wonderful ideas that the community comes up with.The Team fortress 2 community have designed multiple maps already with unique gamemodes which might give interests to the player if they'd like to try something out of the ordinary instead of just fighting.When it comes to classes in the game, Valve had made 9 classes which all give the players a different playstyle that suits them as well as an unplayable 10th character known as the civillian.You could be the scout, Fast and quite a big damage dealer for those with a good aim.Could be a soldier, knowing how to rocket jump to get to the frontlines quick and fast. (i recommend all new solly mains to learn and practice this as it is really useful)There is the pyro, a class which some hate but it also has some great uses such as keeping the spies away, can carry different weapons as well which can suit a players playstyle, whether they'd like to play Defensive, Offensive or even try to flank an enemy to kill them whilst they're not looking.There is the Demoman, a class that is a great damage dealer and can also do his own explosive jumping using his sticky bombs.There is the heavy, a class which owns up to its name, Moves slower than all the classes but makes up for this with its large amount of health, Can swap out its shotgun for something to heal it too.The engineer, a class who builds buildings to support his team and also great on the defensive side too, placing sentries in key areas so the enemies cannot push through.The medic, a class which isn't that common for people to main, Medic's can heal player to build something called an ubercharge, Once at 100%, This uber can be used many different ways depending on the mediguns, from invincibility to high damage dealing to just rapid healing instead.The sniper, This class is a long range damage dealer, one that is deadly in the hands of a good aim as well as a well-timed headshot can kill any class if they've gone scoped long enough.The spy, (Personally, this is the class i main), The spy is a jack of all trades class, He can go on the offensive, Defensive or Supportive, He is able to instant kill key targets with his butterfly knife with a successful backstab (Also known as a Balisong knife), This could take out medics, Snipers or just the annoying classes, He can use his sapper to sap engineer buildings which will then become disabled until they're either destroyed or the sapper itself is destroyed on the building.Spies can also go on the defensive too, being able to backstab any progressing targets, whether its a heavy or pyro or medic, the spy always has you covered.Don't want to fight others?, Well we still got you covered.Team fortress 2 also has a gamemode known as Mann Vs Machine, ( a.k.a MvM for short), Which users can team up in groups of 6 (Or 10 on some community groups)MvM has 2 versions of it, Mann Up and Boot Camp. Mann Up is for the people who like to pay to play for a chance at winning items whilst Boot Camp is like a practice Variant version, You can test out what Mann up would be like and what it is you'd have to face upon going into mann up.Mann Up can earn the players unique rewards based upon the tour the player is doing.Reasons i still play TF2 as of today:+There is alot of people who test your skills in a fight, Only through fighting better opponents will your skill grow.+Valve has managed to launch an VAC Wave, Killed off any aimbotters/Hackers who made the game unfair for others.+Being able to play in the wide variety of custom gamemodes people have designed for it.+Making new friends which i probably have too many right now x3+Always meeting new foes, making new Rivals who i call a great friend too.+You can always challenge yourself to do better in certain areas, Like rocket jumping, Trickstabbing as a spy, etc.+Valve can almost patch any bug within days of it being found, certain bugs being fixed within an hour or 2 too!+There are many communities based around TF2 which are friendly.Reasons i might uninstall TF2?-Can't think of any-Very rarely finding a hacker or 2 on Thundermountain, but thats honestly about it.But yes, Thats all i can think about to write within this Review. I'd always rate this game up.			"

												I'm really liking the new ""If you don't want to play competitive then ♥♥♥♥ you"" update.Bring back the old Quickplay. And no, I'm not going to use community servers. Anybody who has ever been on one will understand how horrible that is. I don't understand why they had to ruin the casual experience to try and force competitive onto everyone.Edit: Stop with the ""Valve is fixing it"" argument. Is it fixed? No, it isn't. Right now Casual is so terrible compared to what Quickplay was it isn't even funny.			"

												There's a point where I can write a review that can be both amazing yet bias at the same time; I hope I don't try to influence anyone by this review alone. When I first got Team Fortress 2, it was an experience that can't be beat. This first-person shooter can't go to say that this is probably the greatest in gaming history. From trading to crafting, this game will keep you on th edge of your seat until you know it's ready to stop playing. There are 9 classes, each that is unique and makes the game fairly balanced, making th game experience even more fun. With all the updates, there are some positive and negative effects than can affect the Team Fortress 2 trading community as a whole, but the whole aspect is to game, have fun, and enjoy your time on this game. It's your decision to buy from the store. It's your decision to craft metal and hats. It's your decision to play, idle, or even be a teammate and balance the rosters. The community is just like this game: random. So if you wish to stop playing other FPS titles and take a break from imbalanced games, then your choice is this: you won't be dissapointed.			"

												I was so excited to load up Team Fortress 2, a cool wacky FPS that was team based and had many variations! Awesome! I said to myself. This must be way better than Call of Duty! As the download was running I sat on my chair eager to play the game, I started searching up some videos on the game and basic gameplay mechanics so I could get the edge on the competition, I learned many things that I could apply in battle! Before I knew it the download was complete! Awesome!I sat there as the game loaded up, eager to get into a server! I saw a map called ""ctf_2fort"" ""That map sounds fun!"" I exclaimed, I joined the server and was greeted with a class selection screen. I figured I should play the sniper since my experience in other FPS would help me through. My first ever spawn! I promptly walked forward out of the doorway and was greeted by a demoman camping spawn with his stickybomb launcher. I died.10/10			"

												I'm the scout who missed you six times at point blank range. I'm the pyro who couldn't reflect in a mirror. I'm the Soldier who just cannot let W go on a rocket jump. I'm the demoman who does zero damage with the stickies, misses every grenade and then random crits you with a bottle, only to step on my last grenade. I'm the heavy who is dead before the spin up finishes. I'm the engineer who always sentry jumps into the path of the sniper's bullet. I'm the medic you think is going to save the push who ♥♥♥♥s up the uber timing. I'm the sniper who missed that bodyshot on your afk team mate. I'm the spy who missed you six times at point blank range from behind.I'm the reason the others abandon when I join a MM beta team. I'm kills 30-2500 on your aussie rocket launcher. I'm the pubstompee.It's been six and a half years for me and I love TF2.Edit:Further to my previous comments - I'm not as keen on the Casual matchmaking as I was on quickplay as it seems to take longer to get into a game, but otherwise TF2 is still great. It's free and it's not pay to win at all, the stock weapons available to all players at start are often the best, other weapons can be earned by completing in game achievements or random drops. Also, repeatedly killing players with expensive unusuals when you are free 2 play can apparantly really annoy them.			"

The story of every TF2 player ever (Based on True Events):Your first day: You just started playing this cool game called ""Team Fortress 2"". You don't know much about it but you think it's pretty neat, with all these cool hats and accessories.A week later: You found a hat called ""Ghastlier Gibus"", and It's pretty awesome! But for some reason, anyone who sees you with it call you a total noob...Month 1: You just became premium! Yay! And you think you're starting to get this whole ""trading system"", but you don't exactly see why it's so important to everyone.Months 2-6:  You are addicted to trading, more than playing the game itself. You have countless hats, stranges and keys, and anyone you trade with and all your friends admire how extremely rich you are.Months 6-12: You've just changed your name to (xxxxxxx) #RoadToUnusual. You really think you can make it as a big time trader. (A bit of scamming along the way, of course.)1+ Years: You have all your dream unusuals, and countless earbuds.  You love your inventory more than anything else in the world. Your profile showcase is an exhibit of your coolest items and achivements in TF2.But then, one day...You come home from school, toss your backpack on your bed and wait for you PC to boot.You open steam, as well as TF2Outpst, looking for cool trades.You see someone selling a cool unusual you want, so you send him a trade offer.But when you open ""My Inventory"", It's empty.""Steam must just be drunk again"", you think to yourself. But not this time... not this time.You slowly, trembling with an odd sensation of fear, anticipation and rage open your inventory history to find out that some scumbag named ""Green Lantern"" stole all your items.-Unusual Counterfeit Billycock-Unusual Birdcage-Unusual Dead Cone-Unusual Shooter's Tin Topi-Unusual Team Captain-Unusual Bonk Boy-Unusual Towering Pillar Of hats-Unusual Le Party Phantom-Earbuds-Earbuds-Earbuds-Earbuds-Earbuds-Earbuds-Earbuds-Earbuds-Earbuds-Earbuds-Earbuds-Earbuds-Earbuds-Earbuds-EarbudsAt that very moment, hundreds of suicidal thoughts cross your mind.You throw up all over your keyboard, and start screaming. Just screaming.You break down on your knees, start crying like a little girl and let the tears flow all over your red, sweaty body.You go to sleep, and dream all about your inventory. The purple of the unusuals, The green of the genuines, The blue of the vintages...And you forget all about it.This review is %100 accurate, I went through it myself.11/10 IGN			"

												-Updating my review for the Steam Awards, but generally it's still the same so i'll keep it simpleThe Good-✓ Still a great game, skill based aim/movement, and old school team shooter gameplay that never gets old,✓ Abusrd amounts of customization in loadouts and appearence, you can really make a class your own,✓ Diverse, and great community, art/cosplay, community competitive scene with honours and prizes, and a great team game for organized playThe not so good- X Developed by Valve, so spotty-to-nonexistant dev communication/support at timesX Matchmaking structure needs attention, which they're working on, and a few relics from 2008 that need to be eliminated like random crits and outdated map/weapon design still create problems in casual, but not game breaking ones.X More community moderation/community tools would be nice, as immature memeing and hateful toxicity hurts the user experience though this is a problem in most popular games.TL,DRAll in all, 9/10, the good outweighs the bad, and you should definately play this game, as there's years worth of content to enjoy, and even more to master.

												Hey here's a review. Read it, you might enjoy it. Or not.Recently, the community has been divided on the issue of whether or not the TF2 devs and Valve care about the future of this game. People get angry at other people for voicing their opinion and start taking sides. If you think things aren't going swell, you anger people. If you think the updates are pretty good, you anger people. It also doesn't help when someone in the the discussion forums who represents either side acts in the most bizarre or immature of ways, making one side look ""stupid"" and just fanning the flames of hate. Others like to cause conflict between the two sides just for a good laugh. This doesn't mean the nuetral side is all that better, as some think that doing nothing helps solve the problem.And yet even with all the problems within the game and it's community, I still highly recommend it to both new and old players as it's a great game. Believe it or not, this game has endured many bad updates and bad reception from it's community and still manages to be one of the most played games on steam.Sure, TF2 will die someday. All games do eventually.  But as of right now, it still manages to provide players endless hours of fun, and may continue to do so for a couple of more years. And hell, not alot of games manage to do what TF2 has done, so get back to having fun will ya?			"

												Oh how the mighty have fallen.TF2 was a game where I spent countless hours talking, playing, and generally have a fun time. About 99% of my friends on my friends list including my close and best friends were met through TF2. TF2 has charming characters with funny and interesting personalities. The backstory is funny and the story was interesting. I have fond memories of spending late nights slicing heads off as a Demoman on Nucleus or market gardening people as Soldier on Hightower. Every day I'd come home and play. The multitude of glitches such as the Halloween doomsday glitch where you could leave the map or the engineer crit glitch. This game was a mess and that was what I fell in love with, a mess, an organized mess. The game was fun even though it wasn’t very balanced with the pyro and the old reserve and all, but it was still fun.The fun lasted a while and stayed strong, that was until the last few months or so. Within the last 6 months I saw this game turn from my most played game to one of my least played (well also the fact that Overwatch came out), and to me that is sad because it was one of my favorites. They killed the pyro class making the pyro twenty times less effective at his job and severely decreasing his dps. I remember when pyros were a threat, now they are the worst class in the game. But that is not what did it for me, I could handle the pyro being bad. This update was the star that broke the camel's back.This update is the worst update in the history of this game and will remain that way till the day this game gets shutdown. Let’s start off with the interface. It sucks. It forces you to default hud. I do have to give it some credit, it does clean up the main menu a bit, but it removed the create server option so no more Tr_Walkway. Next matches have to be qued and you can no longer play on one you must choose 2 of the game modes and then it will choose your map. Really Valve? Plus ranked in “casual”. That’s another thing, casual gameplay was just pubs and there wasn’t anything serious about it just silly fun. Let’s go to gameplay now. Demo and Soldier are OP because for some reason valve increased blast radii. All the weapon changes are weird. Teleporters are insanely cheap to create. The game requires less skill. Items are now more pointless, and generally the whole game is a mess, but this time it’s a horrendous mess, not the mess of a game I fell in love with years ago. In the past I would have given the game a solid 9/10, but now with this update the game is more like a 3/10. Valve is making Call of Duty look like a cutting edge game. Can valve fix TF2? Maybe, but the damage has already been done. I had the dream to do competitive TF2 and my friend had the dream to be on the same team as me, but I guess that is the end of that dream. Both he and I are thinking of quitting the game and cashing out, which the chances for me to do so are high. This game was amazing, and now? It is garbage.It feels sad to leave the game I loved so much and put so much time into. Feels like I’m putting down an old pet. Valve doesn’t listen to their community at all and that is why they suck. If you are a fan of this game I hope you like the new TF2. Looks like I’m going to stick to Overwatch since this game is no longer enjoyable. If you are a new player and like it good for you, but I recommend to stay away from this game. As is has really been turned to rubbishGame Score : 3/10EDIT: Valve is actively reaching out to fix casual mode (which imo is still kinda dumb) which is good. Lets hope Valve can pull TF2 back out of the rutt they put it in.EDIT 2: I don't really care anymoremany balance changes/ changes in general that were added are pointlessHere are some reviews that basically explains things better if you really care

			In the words of the Spy: ""Well, this was a disappointment!"", but I'd have to disagree with him slightly. This update is more than a disappointment. This is one of the worst updates TF2 has ever had.

												If I had to describe this game in one word, it would have to be legendary.This game is older than a lot of games that are still relevent and has a player base averaging about 50,000 strong, and hundreds of people download this game every day, hopefully like you will. I started playing this gem in late 2015, even though I'd known about it since mid 2013. Boy, did I have no idea what I was missing! Upon stepping into the shoes of a character of your choice, be it...Scout, the speedy Bostonian king of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥gery....Soldier, the crazed patriot with a Rocket Launcher....Pyro, the mysterious mumbler with a Flamethrower....Demoman, the drunken one-eyed Scotsman with many different kinds of bombs....Heavy, the Russian sandwich lover with a Minigun....Engineer, a smartass Texan building many different gadgets....Medic, the friendly German devoted to healing his team.....Sniper, the Australian bushman armed with a Sniper Rifle and a jar of his own ♥♥♥♥....and finally Spy, the French enigma with many cloaking capabilites and a deadly backstab....You will find yourself thrown into a game with players who are usually friendly and always help each other out. One reason I love this game so much is how friendly and nice the community is compared to another first person shooter similar to this one that got popular mid 2016. I think you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, this game has a variety of gamemodes to choose from, whether you want to stand on a control point, push a cart, steal a briefcase, destroy some robots for golden weapons, or just fool around, Team Fortress 2 has the gamemode for you!Another thing about this fantastic game is that the community is probably one of the best you will find, because it's probably the reason that this game that will turn TEN YEARS old this year is still fresh and alive. Although your past thoughts about this game if you aren't just now hearing about it is that the community is just about memes and hats. Although this is true to some extent, we also have people editing animated movies in Source Filmmaker and creating new hats to wear and weapons to try, although we haven't seen any new weapons for a while. Every time you join a server, you're bound to see a hat or cosmetic item you've never seen before. And, once you find out it's name, the trading community allows you to get that item pretty easily through turning weapons you don't use into metal, which you can trade for it. Unless it's Unusual, which means it has a cool particle effect, but have fun trying to trade for that!The only thing keeping this game from growing better is Valve itself. They make drastic changes to the game without even running it by the community first, like they did back in July 2016, and there are tons of new hats and weapons just waiting for the okay from Valve to be put into the game, but they don't do it. My closing remarks, Team Fortress 2 is a true gem in the Steam community. It's been here since most games still relevent today and in my opinion is better than Overwatch, but if you're an Overwatch player and you're an alright person or not, I reccomend you at least try it, and if you don't like it, then whatever dude, I don't give a ♥♥♥♥. Anyway, this game has a wide diversity of 9 characters each with different backgrounds and personalities, and gamemodes as equally as diverse. There'll always be new people to play with and new hats to wear every time you play.			"

												Team Fortress 2 is, in a nutshell, a team-based FPS in which the Red and Blue team compete against each other with 9 different classes in various game modes.PROS:+ Free to play + Many maps, gamemodes and tons and tons of weaponry and cosmetics, both official and community-made+ Very beginner-friendly. Unlike games like CS:GO, new players have a very fair chance of beating even experienced players+ You will get weekly drops of weapons (sometimes cosmetics)+ A huge interest in trading items via a network of trading servers and sites. Skilled traders can make profit in the form of real money as well+ It depends if you consider this as a pro, but there's explosivejumping. It's so incredibly fun and there's over 500 downloadable jumpmaps and an active community behind it. At least 400+ of my hours in this game are spent on explosivejumping+ TF2 uses the Source engine, a very comfortable engine and very easy to configure and save settings with + Trading cards CONS: - The community can be kind of toxic and/or cringy at times- Valve keeps adding more and more updates people generally don't enjoy Ever wondered why people who play Valve games have so many hours in their games? Because most Valve games are solid and super enjoyable games that whitstand the test of time; they're always classic and fun. Team Fortress 2 has been around for over a decade and yet its popularity is scarcely rivaled by other top selling games.This is a game you keep on getting back at. It's too brilliant not to play, in all honesty.My rating: 9.5P.S. If you get this game, type ""gamemenucommand openserverbrowser"" in the console to open the default TF2 server browser. This is how TF2 is meant to be played (ultimately) and the way I've always played it.P.P.S. TF2 >>> Counter Strike			"

												Indulge in the never ending struggle between two groups of players forming two sides in a competitive game of mercenaries battling in honour of two fine gentleman who kin each other. You may engage in a sustained fight between the before mentioned armed forces, as one of nine remarkable gentleman. I shall list them now:The soldier sent out ahead of the main force and that departs in a specified direction at great speed.The gentleman that wishes to serve in the military army.The pyrotechnical specialist person.The professional of demolitions.The adult human male that utilizes weaponry of great weight.The person who designs, builds and maintains engines, machines and structures.The trained military person responsible for providing medical care to his associates.The long range combatant whose sole purpose is to take out foes from a far.And the entrepreneur of sensory shapeshifting with purpose of infiltrationary actions.If you feel the urge of engaging in activity of enjoyment and recreation other then the aforementioned battle between these two remarkable armed forces, allow oneself to enjoy the pleasure of fighting against a large group of robots created by the gentleman related to the two previously mentioned brothers by way of sharing the same father and mother, in the game-technique known as ""Gentleman versus Machinery"". If these game-techniques do not fulfill your wishes you may engage in the activity designated ""Hattoning"" where one uses silly headwear to show superiority towards his other colleagues. If you desire to be apart of the community envolving this activity you may have to virtualize your actual medium of exchange in the form of coins and banknotes into virtual articles and units. I assign this computerised game 5 stars.TTFN   John Hatsworth "

Ok let's begin.First of, Valve. The communication between you and the community is really bad. You know it, I know it, everyone knows it and it really needs to be fixed. It shouldn't be that much of a problem for you to take 1 hour or 2 each week to go through some of the most popular reddit or community hub discussions and respond to at least some of them. It would have a positive effect, unlike the silent treatment you've been giving us for the past few years which are negatively impacting how we see Valve and their employees._________________________________________________Next, we really need some way to know what sort of changes you want to put into the game before it is released. It wasn't uncommon that you've made some changes to which the community reacted in a negative way and you had to change it back or modify it several times until the thing being changed wasn't anything like it used to be before.Take, for instance, the dreaded Phlogistinator. The whole mess with giving it invurnerability on taunt could've been avoided if there was some communication going on between you and the community. You had to change the weapon several times until things finally went quiet. And in the end it may actually be worse than what we had before any of these changes. Most recent unnecessary changes were changing the Righteous Bison. I don't think I need to tell you that that was a huge mistake as the weapon is not really usable anymore in the way it was before. It's a gimmick now. What strikes me as really odd and a bit frustrating is the change log which claimed that the weapons ability to hit the same player multiple times was a bug... No, no it wasn't a bug. It was right there in the loading screen tips saying that it's this weapons ability and no one really had an issue with that weapon. In several years of playing this game I haven't had an issue with that nor did I ever hear anyone have an issue with it.I won't go further into why some changes were bad or why some may be good, people have already written about it better than I can, but I think everyone agrees that we need to hear about the changes before they happen to avoid bad choices._________________________________________________Let's talk matchmaking now...It really started rough, and I don't think anyone will forget the half an hour to an hour long wait for a game any time soon. Luckily the wait time has dropped down significantly, but it could use a bit more work. The complete removal of quick play is honestly a mistake, some people really liked being able to pop in and out of any game whenever they wanted, and that was probably one of the go to reasons to play TF2 for some. While casual matchmaking is nice if you want to play a game which is a bit more organized while not having the seriousness of the competitive, it's not always as fun as silly quickplay used to be. You've basically forced everyone into the casual matchmaking in order to give us more organized games where players could work to win... but you've also forced everyone else who doesn't want to play that way into the same room. In short, keep the matchmaking, but bring back quickplay.An issue that I had with matchmaking is that the party system limits you to only 6 players. This really sucks if I have more than 5 friends (which I do) so one of us cannot play with the rest. Additionally, not being able to jump into the game your friends are playing ruins the experience further, though this is a bit trickier than the party problem.It isn't all bad however, the party system and matchmaking do allow at least 6 of us to have a guaranteed place on the same team so no one has to sit out while hoping that someone leaves the server and opens a spot for them.Addendum: The game can now start with less than 24 players, which should lower the wait time. Players can fill in the spots as they become available. It's certainly much better than to match people into servers that are too far away from them. _________________________________________________Let's talk competitive, shall we?So the beta has come and gone and I can't get over the feeling that the feedback you guys got from the players was ignored. I tried it during the beta and again after release, and it feels pretty much the same. And it's not really good. In the beta I could forgive a lot of stuff because it is indeed the beta, but we all expected a reasonably polished system on launch. However our expectations weren't really matched with your delivery. The system often matches wildly different ranks, there's nothing stopping completely new and clueless players from joining and quite frankly causing others to lose because they had to carry them. And this has happened, I've seen a few players who didn't know what to do and I've read other peoples stories, including one where one of the guys actually just installed the game.Perhaps you should limit the competitive to those who had played in the casual matchmaking for some time and leveled to a certain level, kind of like in CS:GO?Also the current way system works is seriously flawed. If someone leaves, the winning team just wasted their time playing for nothing and the losing team loses nothing. The person who left only has to wait 30 minutes before doing it again and they also don't get any loss to their rank either.This issue needs to be your top priority.According to the latest update on 28th of July, the penalties for leaving have been made harsher. This is a welcome change, however, as how it works, or if it works properly, we will see. Currently it works by having longer cooldowns for the first offenders with low number of games played.However no word on the issue with winning team wasting their time while the losing team gets no loss if someone leaves the game at any point.Addendum: FOV slider has been brought back (up to 70), now Valve did say they fixed some of the broken animations related to those FOVs, but people have been reporting issues with some animations and animations in min viewmodel mode. Guess we're not wrong in saying that valve doesn't play their own game._________________________________________________One more thing. The performance issues really need to be sorted. It's weird that a game from 2007 can sometimes bring a modern computer to only 60 frames on certain official maps.Now the fact that it brings a modern PC to this means that a PC that's weaker but still should, in theory, play the game smoothly doesn't actually go smooth in practice.Admittedly a lot of this is from so many things being tacked onto the game in the past 9 years, but still warrants fixing to at least some degree.I think I'm going to wrap this up here.In short, communicate more, talk more about upcoming changes and have a testing ground for people to see how it works and to give feedback, bring back quickplay, allow larger parties, fix the issues with competitive outlined above.And please, enough with the cosmetics, people really want functional items. The last 3 years were really disappointing and the only updates that are more or less good are the ones that brought us new functional items or new game mechanics (like picking up the weapons of your fallen friends or foes from the Gun Mettle which was a better update).That's it from me, have a lovely 2016 year. Cheers.Edit: Overall there's been some ""nice"" changes, but nothing good enough. More info about changes are on TF2's website.			"

I have played this game for an entire year;  time for my account on it.I have logged 3,648 hours at the time of editing this review at this moment in time.The fact that this game is pushing a decade old, and is still the 3rd or 4th most played game on Steam should hint to you something; This game is good, and at the price of absolutely free, why the ♥♥♥♥ have you not downloaded it yet?This game has a special place in my heart; there's not one game that has let me know people from all sorts of walks of life, and get to play with, or against them, or end up being Sandvich-sharing, congaing friends in the end; a game that can hold your interest for 3,648 total hours, and people's overall interest for 9 years, is obviously a game you need to try.Now, to the core value of the game; this is easily the most balanced shooter out there; this game is ""Pay2Pimp"", otherwise known as pay for a crapton of virtual hats that give you no actual advantage in-game except making you look more suavy. Everything in this game can be earned by just playing the game, and there's nothing in this game that exclusively a P2P user can get over a F2P user that actually gives them an advantage in-game, it's truly F2P, and doesn't require you to buy stuff to get ahead in the game, unless you want to really get involved in TF2's dynamic trading which is entirely optional but oh so recommended if you like to put stuff on your head.Team Fortress 2 has more gamemodes than any shooter I have ever seen before; and I CHALLENGE you to find a game with more gamemodes and variety than TF2. Along with the core implemented gamemodes in TF2, there are a ton of mods, or other gamemodes made by the community if you get tired of Capture Points, Payload, King of the Hill, Capture the Flag, Attack/Defend, Mannpower, Territory Control, Medieval Mode, PASS Time, Robot Destruction, Mann vs Machine, Player Destruction, Payload Race, Special Delivery, Arena Mode, Competitive twists on these modes, along with OVER A HUNDRED offical maps to go along with these core modes, along with more maps from the community workshop being added into the game over time. You'll never have something you haven't done in TF2.You have a competitive; intense, action-packed, fast-paced scene, a more laid-back casual, public-server stomping, conga-around-the-map-instead-of-playing-the-objective, four-Snipers-and-three-Spies-on-one-team cluster-♥♥♥♥ scene, and of course, the infamous, yet so hat-involved trading scene with a functioning, living, breathing, striving economy that's just waiting for you to have the next most expensive chunk of pixels in the game. Whether you want to take this game seriously, semi-seriously, or not seriously what-so-ever, you're GOING to have FUN.Though I may not convince everybody this game is for them, and not to listen to all the hate currently going on; 90% of these current negative reviews are about Competitive, or Casual. Albeit broken, they are still working on it, but there's always the blooming, flourishing community server community, of course. If you feel like kicking back with friends on a server of your choice, on the map of your choice, in the gamemode of your choice do JUST THAT! Just remember; the intentions of Casual are meant to be good intentions, not a scheme to destroy the community. It's certainly not perfect, but it's coming together ever so slowly like a giant complicated jigsaw puzzle.This game is free; there's no risk to trying it. You have nothing to lose, and so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ much to gain, after playing it for a little; I wish everyone could see the magic behind this game, the same way I do. It's really just beautiful.			"

I won't recommend it until they fix the mess they created, even then, I doubt they'll take responsibility for being absolutely ♥♥♥♥ at keeping their own game updated properly.I'm sure I'll get told ""dood you're too hard on vulve' or 'it's a hard job you try it.'Screw that.I know making video games is hard. I work in a Deli, you think I know how to do anything more than basic programming?But I ♥♥♥♥ing do my job. I do what I'm told and go above and beyond in serving the customer. When someone tells me I did something incorrectly I don't look at them blankly and ignore their existence and proceed to make the same error for seven months, I ♥♥♥♥ing fix my mistake and apologize. You can't have a good relationship with your playerbase when you ignore every single piece of criticism.			"

												game is mostly the same as it was before.tf2 is still casual.The game still is unbalanced.free to players still don't know how to play the game.there's still maps that no one plays.there's still maps that are just stalemate fests.there's still friendlies who just waste a slot in the server,there's still there is still neon bright people with terrible taste.there's still people who join just to ""try hard"" and ruin others fun.there's still hackers.But that all fine, it's been like this for years now.what is not fine, is the community parroting stuff like ""TF2 IS DEAD"" ""THIS IS THE WORST UPDATE EVER"" ""VALVE DOSEN'T CARE ABOUT THE COMMUNITY""the ironic thing is, the community is killing the game more that any update could do,trashing everything valve does (or not do)telling others to leave the game.and giving the most useless of feedback for the devs.just because some of the community overhyped an update because a dev said it was going to be ""neato"" and now the game is ""literally dead"" because of that.""THEY KILLED QUICKPLAY!""you mean what killed community servers in the first place, and that most regions did not have quick-play servers until this update.""YOU HAVE TO WAIT SO MUCH TO FIND A GAME, CASUAL IS JUST WORSE QUICKPLAY""Even in my third-world country at 5 am it does not take more than 3 minutes to find a game, yes, it's more than instantly like the old quick play system. but now I can play with my friends without getting auto balanced every 2 minutes.""TF2 IS NO LONGER CASUAL FUN""is still just as casual, the difference now that some people actually try to play the objective, shocking, I know, but now the casual servers feel more like tf2 was at release and/or in a community server, and if all of tf2 for you was getting easy kills with no real objective, maybe this game might not be for you at all. (or try playing in cp_orange_x3 servers)""VALVE CHANGED THE WAY I WANT TO PLAY THE GAME""no they did not, none of the weapons are banned, nor there is a class restriction. you can still play a ""trolldier"" in plr_hightower and play in an endless stalemate, is just that more players are playing the objective and that makes you upset because is not as easy. we get it leddit.The only thing that is really broken right now is comp, but that only makes like 10% of the complains, and this overreaccion is not how you go about things.

												Team Fortress 2 is like a story about a great wonder child that eventually decended into a family whid two tired fathers.  [The 2 Valve Employe's that update the game] Where the Game was feed nothing but the same thing over and over but had great friends that supported him [The TF2 Community] Only fore the two fathers too brush those friends away and tell that boy too become a accountant or some other office related employe.. while meanwhile the Game dreamed about Sky diving, Climbing mountains and vaste ambitions.. only too have those thoughts of 'Fun' slowly plucked away bit by bit by the two farthers that wanted the game grow up how they and only they wanted it. Team Fortress 2 has had its Golden Age, Over and Over whid those Few Updates that sat the game on a Straight path fore improvement.. only fore the Developerteam too Undo their progress whenever they get unsure. And this started even before the Meet your match ''Update'' ..    that was just simply the final blow that plunged TF2 on a Road that it will have a hard time recovering from too be like it once was.    Despite being one of the most highly played Free games on steam its also one whid the most cheerishable memories from veterans that played it, a way too happily greet new people that has joined steam as most often its teh first game they get fore their library., all in all... Team Fortress 2 Still stands, its still alive, and far from 'Dead'.  But that is not too say its skipping joyfully. and carefree.. Team Forterss 2 Needs a change of developer Staff. and at this point? seeing the latest Halloween update? the game is not ever going too progress towards another good update the way things are now. Doing perhaps the same thing they did whid CS:GO where a seperate company creates updates and content as valve has proven they are incapable of this, They either do not have the time available too make content fore the game, and thereby rush it too meet deadlines... So giving the control too others, while still keeping the brand? would only save this Old Wonderchild of a game. from the next 20 Stale Updates that bring !NOTHING! progressive or entertaining too the game..  So its time too cease looking at our game like some decaying cattles corpse.. and understand your very actions you have been taken fore the coming years.. Show some respect fore the game you put 9 years of development into, and the Community that is everyday playing it and just clinging too that hope that MAYBE.. just maybe.. We can open our eyes oneday and see the game some us has pledged 1000's? of hours, some even 5000 hours. OR BEYOND THAT be like how it was when things seemed too finally be going towards improvement.Its almost amazing the amount of dedication that some players or Veterans have towards Team Fortress, and its so sad too see the developers not take notice of the crowd they have cheering fore them too pump out refreshing idea's and content fore the players too enjoy.Valve needs too do the same thing they did whid CS:GO, they need too grant the control of development over too someone or 'something' that has more time on their hand too care fore this game. and come up whid some new ideas. ''Team Fortress 2 was great, and is still good, but lets not settle fore a bronze medal this time.''-Another TF2 Veteran.			"

												TF2 was a fun and casual game that I could join a game and just play with my freinds, if I had to leave the server I could but now Valve has ruined their own servers making casual into competetive lite. People might just say ""play on a community server."" community servers are full of crappy ad-ons, a bunch of annoying ads that wont stop playing, alltalk, ect. competetive was a nice ad on but they should have not touched casual it was fine the way it was.EDIT: They are fixing it, which is good.

												I'm going to be completely honest, Team Fortress 2 is one of the best free games I have ever played, but Valve just isn't paying enough attention to this game, they just continue to update it because it's a money maker.I recommend Team Fortress 2 for the game, not for the developers.TF2 has stood the test of time, but I sadly think it's time is over. Of course this is just an opinion, but this is coming from someone that has spent more than 1 thousand hours playing this game, trust me, once you play for a while it gets boring.			"

												If you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients- To Make the Dough375 grams (3 cups) plain flour1/2 teaspoon salt2 eggs1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) waterExtra flour for dusting - To Make Cheese Filling15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.1/2 cup cheddar cheese2 eggs, lightly beaten1/2 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon pepper- ExtrasYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)Parmesan cheeseBasilFried vegetablesShrimpFish slicesChicken pieces Make the Ravioli filling.- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough.- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!

												I used to love going to the malls and try on different hats. But I wasted so much gas and my parents would get mad at me. Then one day my friend told me about a hat simulator called Team Fortress 2where you can try on billions of hats. My hat addiction has finally been fulfilled, thanks TF2. 10/10 best hat simulator out there.			"

												Team Fortress 2 is a FPS game, developed by Valve, releasing in October 2007 on Steam, Xbox 360 and PC. You are probably going to see this review and think “Why are you reviewing TF2, everyone knows what it is about!” You will be right; however there is a small portion of people who have not ventured into TF2’s world, so this will be for you!  Gameplay for Team Fortress 2 is based around various different game modes, which you take part in online servers.  You join a team and choose one of nine different classes to play as. Some of the game modes include the classic capture the flag, control points, king of the hill, and payload – which requires you to move a cart across the map with a bomb attached to it, into the enemies base. The 9 different classes all feel very different to each other, but ultimately will fit into one of three roles; offense, defence and support. Offensive characters are the ones built for dealing large sums of damage to your foes. The defensive ones, whilst these also deal damage, are much more equipped for doing this from entrenched positions, and the support roles add different features to the team with healing or other special abilities which act as a benefit for your team, or a hindrance to the opponents.  The classes are all really simple to learn how to use, but can be pretty tricky in mastering the art of the class.  My favourite game mode in Team Fortress 2 would have to be Mann vs Machine. This is a six player co-op mode, where you have to defend your base from waves of AI controlled enemies. In between waves you are able to purchase upgrades for your character to use for the rest of the match. This game mode also offers a “Mann up” mode, which requires you to purchase a ticket, in order to take part in events on official servers, to be in for a chance to win cosmetic items after you finish the mode. Even if you stick to the free side of this mode, you will have a boat load of fun if you can find a team of players and get on voice chat together. Graphically, since the game is running the Source engine, it looks gorgeous. The cartoony style of art on show gives the game a unique charm and feels which cannot be mimicked by any other game to date. Sound effects and sound tracks are all on point too.TF2 has a training mode that will ease newer players into the game; this is especially handy for people who are particularly new to the FPS genre as well. This is a game which definitely gets better the better you are at it; and getting better at it only comes with practice. If you find a class you are interested in, and stick with it, you’ll soon get to a point where you are coming top of the scoreboard at the end of the game. Of course it helps to have a little experience with all of the classes because diversity is key in these multiplayer type games, but having a main is also a good idea too. My play time on TF2 is dwarfed by many, I have only been playing for about seventeen hours so far, and I have only really started playing it properly in the last few weeks, having dropped in and out of it a few times in recent years. Mann vs Machine has really got me hooked on the game again. If you are a FPS junky, this is about as good as it gets for the genre and you will be able to get hundreds of hours of game play out of it before it even becomes tedious. Some people have thousands of hours in this game and I cannot blame them. On top of the huge replay ability factor, TF2 also has over 500 achievements, which should keep even the keenest of achievement hunters busy for a sufficient amount of time. This game is so perfectly put together from a technical stand point; I have had no bugs, no crashes, and the graphics are perfectly optimized that even when playing on a 4k resolution with all of the settings ramped up to max, I still had a 200 frame rate. To sum up, Team Fortress 2 is the perfect model of a free to play game done absolutely right. As you may have been able to notice, I have not once mentioned the market and microtransactions part of this game in my review, and this is because I found no reason to ever need to put my hand into my wallet to buy anything. Real hard-core fans will be itching to purchase a few cosmetic items, but if you are looking for a casual first person shooter experience, Team Fortress 2 will tick all of the boxes, and it comes out on top of most, if not all of the recent shooters out there to date. If you are one of the handful amounts of people who have not played TF2 for any substantial amount of time, I seriously urge you to give this game an evening of your time, and let it suck you in to its highly addictive nature.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												Team Fortress 2 is not just a really fun, free to play, first person shooter with a very large variety of game-play styles, an awesomely distinct art-style and rather comedic storyline. It also breaks a lot of conventions in the genre and has continued to be a proving ground for what a game is truly capable of. For the past five years or so TF2 has consistently evolved through a series of major updates introducing new game-play elements(minor patches for bugs are issued at least bi-weekly), and, occasionally, festive seasonal updates that make TF2 more eventful.Unlike a lot of FPS out there, Team Fortress provides plenty of things to do other than just ""shot bullet"". TF2 has a really nice replay feature which you can direct, star in, edit, and render in Über quality(regardless of system specs) your own wartime films that can be posted to YouTube via in-game function. TF2 was also one of the first FPS to have a tradeable item drop system which has produced a very large and viable trading community and market where loot found or crafted in the game is exchanged for other in-game valuables like fancy apparel, rare Items/Weapons, games from the steam store, or even real world $ on the black-market. This micro-economic meta-game is what will essentially help support the game indefinitely, and rewards players for there time spent playing the game, and making it a worthy investment for learning the game. The only downside I can note about Team Fortress 2 is that it is currently over 12 gigabytes in size and it will eventually get much larger if it continues on this upgrading trend. Being the king of free to play games, I give Team Fortress 2 a perfect score 10 out of 10.			"

												Wallet vacuum 2015 is a unique simulation game where you are given a list of hundreds of 12 year olds' birthday parties with a maximum of 24 guests allowed and you get to pick which one to go to!  Remember, don't play well, but pay well as you are given very interesting and informative facts about your mother's social life and the size of your crotch from intellectual children wearing their student loans as digital representations of hats.  But hold on there, tiger, there's so much more!  This here is a team game with 9 classes.  Your team mates will pick very strategic combos such as: pyro, pyro, pyro, pyro, scout, scout, scout, soldier, pyro, demoman, pyro, engineer, pyro, soldier, pyro, and defenitely not medic because why heal when you can squeal (yes, the E button to call for heals).  ""But why does this matter when I can dance the conga in the spawn?"" good question my boy! You don't have to leave the spawn!  This is called setting up the Armaments Fun Kamp (also known as the AFK) where you can trade, taunt, and even just join and leave your keyboard to show how much you love using up space on a server.  Plus, you too can witness the decorative atmosphere known as ""capture points"" and ""intelligence briefcases"" that are placed in very important places on the map for you to stare at, but don't touch! As best said by xXx_W0lF_xXx ""Why get the objective when you can get kills?"" A modern wiseman he is.  You can complete your wallet vacuum experience by opening a ""crate o' ♥♥♥♥"" which is literally $2.49 to ride an emotional rollercoaster which ends in disappointment and a gun that was good the month before you received it. But that's ok! You can make your pathetic peashooter interesting by purchasing a nametag and conjuring up creative nomenclature for it such as ""noob punisher"" and ""looks like ur dead lel Xd"".   So what are you waiting for? Grab your lighter and all the dollar bills you can find because this is an offer you don't want to miss out on! I definitely didn't play over 1,000 hours of this!  I swear!  I totally didn't buy any of these hats I'm talking about!  I.... I uh... ♥♥♥♥. 11/10 credit card still has scorch marks.			"

 4079h of playtime, at the time of this review.  Damn. How to review a 10 years old game?   PROS+The balance. You can enter in this game and actually play with the stock basic weapons of each class and you'll not be in disadvantage. Every weapon has its ups and downs in the most variety of situations. Its hard to find a multiplayer game with this kind of balance. +9 great classes. Can you think on a 10th class? In my opinion this game managed to get all playing forms into 9 different classes,  each one unique,  each one with its ups and downs,  just like the weapons. Once again,  great balance. +Game modes. You'll have a bunch of different game modes to play.  Capture points, payload, payload race, king of the hill,  capture the flag,  and so many more,  even in community servers..  There's everything. You can even play freakin' hide n' seek. +Microtransactions done right.  Everything you can buy in-game doesn't give you any advantage while playing.  You can either get tools, cosmetic items or weapons which,  as said before, will not get the game unfair.  True F2P,  and not P2W. +Variety of weapons,  maps and cosmetics. This game has everything. +Competitive and casual gaming included. + Seasonal events. Halloween, Christmas,  etc,  gets you special gaming period with game modifications. Halloween is great! +10 years of updates and counting.  How many games get this support? +Humor. Voice lines are awesome. And taunts. Just awesome. +TF2 Economy.  This game has its own economy and it was one of the first games that introduced trading system. Maybe it was the first?+ Its F2P!  Try it!  CONS - Weapons nerfs and buffs. Over the years we had changes in the weapons.  Some were need.. Others not so much. And some are still needed to this day. Its not easy,  but the weapons could have a better analysis in this topic,  I think. - Bugs after big updates. My years  of experiencing this game showed me that after a big update comes a roll of problems,  usually resolved after a small period of...  Days? -  Too many items. The game got to a point where there are so many,  so many,  but sooo many items... Dont get me wrong,  its cool to have items but..  Kinda exagerating now? So many crates with so much cosmetic items..-Reskin weapons.  Weapons with same stats of others..  But reskined? I'd prefer that each weapon had unique stats.  And this comes all the way back from the first years of the game.   OVERALL 9.8/10 -   The game of a lifetime  "

												Sometimes you just want a game that doesn't need too much thinking. Other times you just want a game where winning and losing the round means nothing but the fact that you've just had loads of fun and a good laugh. And there are still times when you just want to play something that washes away all the ♥♥♥♥ you've taken all day. For all these times, you need TEAM FORTRESS 2!!			"

												I made a review on TF2 a while ago while all of the Meet your Match drama and hate was still going. I deleted that review and made this one because ♥♥♥♥ it, valve can add casual and remove quickplay, they can kill off a soldier secondary that wasn't even good to begin with but TF2 is still a game I love. Even with all these flaws, I'm still putting a thumbs up for this game. At the end of the day, I love TF2. Yes I have played overwatch but I will side with TF2 in all of these TF2 vs overwatch arguments because it's hard to compare overwatch to TF2. Did overwatch create payload? No TF2 did. Does overwatch have an active community making them content which can be published with a push of a button? No but TF2 does. Has overwatch been thriving for over 9 years? No, it's only been around for few months. As one of my favourite games, it's going to take a lot more than Meet your Match or overwatch to kill off TF2. But before you thumb down this review because I dissed overwatch. Just remember, TF2 has hats.			"

												All the way from 2007 and still going strong. When I quote, ''going strong'' I usually tend to think so in the community workshop and hat section of this game. Although they aren't the main aspects of this game, but on a serious note, this game is excellent, fun and arguably flawless. So, what's the best of it now? Well, it's totally free and definitely worthy of the quote; ''The most fun you can have online.'' coming from the humble editors of PC Gamer magazine.The game has a wide and diverse selection of 9 different classes, ranging from their own unique abilities and strategies that can be performed against the opposing team. Similiar to a ''rock, paper, scissors'' scenario, where everything is fair and there are no ''over-powered'' classes. The fast, Boston-talking and even more fast running Scout, to the towering, minigun-wielding hulk of a Russian man, known as the Heavy. Every character class usually represents a soldier in a common FPS' of some sort. What I truly love about these characters is the fact that Valve has openly breathed life, vibrant personalities, characteristics and nationalities into this rag-tag bunch. I also enjoyed the customization of weapons and accessories, named after the witty puns, along with the slight ethnic slur and referenced culture of that said character. This really brings out the comedic flare within the game and shows that humour can mix amusement in along with entertainment the players from around the globe can express and relate to, depending on the gamer's nationality.When it comes to the plot of the game, the elements of storytelling isn't entirely shown into clear perception. It mainly focuses on the two, competitive industries of RED (Reliable Excavation Demolition) and BLU. (Builders League United) Who both subsequently conquer half of the world, known as the Badlands. Each corporation administers its half of the world with a multi-disciplined army of paper pushers. One of those ''paper pushers'' is you and your whole team, when playing this game.A fantastic thing to note in this game is the fact that it's holiday themed. Either new campaigns modeled after a specific holiday, down to the newly cashed in, fan made hats are launched to the public to bring in funds for both Valve and the original creator at hand. Halloween, Christmas, Easter just to name a few are a great example and addition to the game's growing campaign and community. It's also important to note that the game is getting updated at a steady pace, with the occasional UI updates and other fun concepts, such as poses and character interactions being frequently implemented to wet the appetites of the individual player's preference.I don't have much to complain about this game, other than the fact that majority of the servers you connect to, you'll most likely encounter 13-year-olds who constantly nag and try their luck to command the rest of the whole team, which sometimes resorts to foreign/eastern european person nagging about the 13-year-old's nagging, so it's not rare to see a big kick off between young kids and ignorant foreign kids going absolute bonkers on a connected match. It's more fun to not say a word at this point in time and just watch the ultimate climax between the raging two forces.I definitely recommend this game. Not just down to the fact that it's free, but because it still remains fun to this day and constant updates on campaigns and official hat accessories keep this game alive, making the game overall timeless...which, doesn't affect the game's mechanics at all but, only along the lines of taunts and so on and so forth.

I can still go in a server and do the exact same stuff. Valve is fixing all they can, or should I say, the 6 devs are (Maybe you should be protesting that)Anyways the actual rating of this game and many peoples enjoyment has gone down more as a result of your pathetic hate bandwagon than the actual flaws of the update.

												The Meet Your Match update was toted by Valve to be a complete overhaul of the existing UI and the format by which casual and competitve players select what type of game mode they specifically want. What ultimately happened is:- You can no longer pick what public server you want- You're forced to sit in a queue for at least 5 minutes, oftentimes longer if you don't rage quit by the 20 minute mark- 'Casual' servers have experience but you get penalized if you leave a server early- Since the update came out, the 'item servers' and 'game coordinator' are barely functional- If you wanted to play competitive, you better pay the premium!Valve has tried too hard to consolidate everything. They took away Quickplay, the server browser, and the ability to jump in/out of a game ... because God forbid you have any other commitments in your life. If you can't sit through a whole 30 minute Payload game without the ability to change teams, you better be ready to get dinged for it. In summary, the post-MYM Team Fortress 2 is oftentimes literally unplayable –– whether you be waiting in purgatory to join a game, or waiting for the 'can't connect with game coordinator' error message to go away. And when its not literally unplayable, it's pretty much unplayable.P.S. TEAM HEAVYEDIT: After I wrote this review, I waited 30 minutes in queue without ever joining a game.			"

												TF2, worst game everWasted my time and money just for hats10/10 will keep playingOn a more serious note,this is a wonderful and amazing gameI've spent hundreds of hours playing this and I don't regret it at all. It never gets old because no two matches are really the same, something will always be different as soon as those spawn doors open and you run out onto the front lines. There are many fun and interesting weapons that you can combine together that suit your play style and strategies, along with finding the perfect class or classes that just fit your style of play and keep you coming back for more. There are are many fun game modes, official and custom, that you can play. As well as tons of fun official and custom maps to enjoy. My personal favorite game mode would by Capture the Flag on my favorite map 2Fort.Even though TF2 is 7 years old its still very active and keeps getting update with minor as well as major updates which add all sorts of new content.  Usually the major updates are pretty good, but there are times when they can fall flat. But that doesn't happen too often. BONUS DUCKS!And of course I wouldn't dare to end this without mentioning the hats.  The many hats and misc items for every class allow you to stand out among your fellow players and make you look unique. There are tons of unique, interesting, and ridiculous combination you can make by combining the wide assortment of cosmetic items and I simply love it! This game is awesome and overall unique compared to the other multi-player FPSs I have played and that's what makes it so great, it's different and that's the way I like it.Also, the Pyro is a light bulb until proven otherwise, and even if he is proven to be otherwise, disregard it and continue believing he is a light bulb, because he is a light bulb. Thank you			"

												Even though Valve doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about this game anymore, except for the 16 people working on this game, it's really great for it's age. With my 4k+ hours, I can tell you guys, that it is worth to invest your time & effort into this game. The community might be a little toxic, but that's nothing compared to other games like LoL, Battlefield, CS:GO and so on. Every mercenary has his own personality. You have the Medic, that ol' psycho. The sniper with his sexy australian accent, the one eyed, scottish, black man, who's always drunk. (Not racist, fam. <3) and so on. If you never played TF2, get some friends and play it with them, it's such a great game with friends. And don't fear to use voice chat ingame, even if you're shy, it always helps your team if you give them more intel. Well, I hope this review actually does something and gets peeps to play this game, so that Valve finally starts giving a ♥♥♥♥ about this game. Oh and, side note. It actually is worth to spend money on it for hats, weapons, keys, etc. Helps the development, you know?			"

												Team Fortress 2 is a really stupendously addictive and fun FPS game. The game revolves around a set of 9 classes, each of which have strengths and weaknesses and counters, whose duty it is to conquer the opposition.The thing about TF2, at least for me, is the artstyle. The comic cartoonyness of the characters and world is incredibly fun and light. It's the perfect game to blow off some steam and relax after a long day. The players, at least in my experience, are all generally really nice. I feel this is because being ""bad"" at TF2 is not really a factor.Regardless of your skill level, how much time you've spent on TF2, or how much money, everyone can contribute and everyone can have a great time. One of the strongest parts of the game is that losing, dying or being killed doesn't lead to hate or anger or frustration. A game in TF2 can last from 3 to 10 minutes, and these short rounds contribute to a lack of concern if you lose. Not in a bad way, not in a way which results in you not caring about the game in general, but in a way where if you lose you don't blame yourself, or your team mates, for the loss. It's refreshing and fantastic.Hugely recommended from myself. I've spent about 550+ hours in the game, am in no way a master, half-decent maybe, and I have no reason to stop playing. The game is consistently updated with new maps, items, lore and content and I look forward to many more hundreds of hours of gameplay.Nilesy			"

Gameplay+ A ♥♥♥♥-load of map's.+ Requires quick reflexes and thinking.+ P2P have no real in-game advantage.+ Many game mods and all mostly different.+ Guns hit hard, Many different weapons in variety.+ Teamwork required, you can't just always go one-man army+ Shooting mechanics are solid and hit-boxes mostly do register.+ And how could i forgot our beloved-Hats,taunts and much more.+ 9 balanced classes, as well add a variety between different play-styles.+ Servers and network are mostly good unless you have a really bad internet.+ Enjoyable on it's own whether you are going on big streaks or just trolling..+ Workshop support, thus many community made items and maps as well game mods.+ Not PayToWin, no level up or progression system instead you get items from the item-drop system. Surely you can buy most stuff from the store but it never feels unfair.- Many outdated in-game tip's.- Load times can get long in-game.- Solo bot matches are not pause-able.- Bot A.I can get odd and weird at times.- Some of the beta-game modes get little to no updates.- Runs on a very old engine, which is why many odd optimization issues.- Many weapons have specific stats that are not stated in the description.- Many,many Bugs,bugs and bugs thus leading to many odd things and exploits.- Overtime they nerf a weapon so much that it becomes useless and buff 1 or 2 a lot more.- Not such a good community, everyone does Lenny-faces and ♥♥♥♥. f2ps get flamed on and much  more.- A big learning curve you will most probably need to log in more than a hundred hour's to understand most of the stuff.Guns are solid and hits do register, fast reflexes and quick thinking required and much more, while many,many bugs and overall not a good community with many scammers and much more.Graphics+ Great,great Animations.+ Well even though old but very bearable and fine enough.- Needs many texture-improvements.- Backpack icons are poorly rendered.- in game-models need many improvement.Well graphics mostly are just fine and animations great,while bearable but need many texture improvements. Design+ Menu is good enough and well organized.+ A feel of the 19s but with many futuristic elements.+ Map design is fine not to different but not to similar.+ Cartoonish and done right, feel different and pleasing.- Some poor design decisions in some maps.- Menu gets unresponsive many of the times, either when opening your inventory and such.Cartoonish kind of pleases your eyes, map design fine and much more, while some poor design decisions. Sounds and (OST)+ Good voiced character responses.+ Music is just great with a oldish touch.+ Guns and all that have solid and pleasing sounds.Not much to say here. But something fully done right.ConclusionFully recommended if you are just looking for a fun and casual fps. While has many problems of it own but they never break out the real fun so, a good game overall but with a little roughness around the edges.===================================================================Click me and follow us as Curator "

												I'm changing this review for the sake of the nominations. That being said, since the new team of developers KILLED the game by completely ignoring the community unless they give them free content via their oh-so-generous community updates, I cannot recommend this game anymore. 7000 hours of playtime, I LOVED TF2 back when Robin was still on the team, but ever since he left, the new team actively destroyed the game and it seems like they don't even give a crap about it. They took my favorite videogame of all time and progressively destroyed it without listening to the community.			"

												Fantastic game.. until the so called ""meet your match"" update decided to not only update the game but completely annihilate the game.It all begun with a very vocal, but ultimately a minority, calling for a bland yet rampantly generic competitive mode to apply to Team Fortress 2 as well. While this would be a great addition to the game, I stress that making this the ONLY mode is beyond impetuous.Let’s look at the bigger picture for a second, the indomitable tag for this game is the most fun you can have online. This is something I unflinchingly used to believe in, seeing a spy get panned in the face as a heavy munches down a sandwich. A friendly heavy from the other team throws you a sandwich or a pyro from the other team just baffled by how something utterly ridiculous happened gives you a thumbs up and moves on without being hostile. The moments where you just start laughing out loud happen all the time.This cauldron of humour is made possible by exactly Pub Games! Where there is nothing at stake for winning or losing and you can at any time change or search for another server with your preferred ping, player amount, gamemode and map. Replacing this with a rank chasing casual mode only will ossify the fun and with that the soul of the game.Now let me elaborate, as much as I hate matchmaking itself and being unable to join friends in progress that’s not important here. It’s the simple fact that with people being pit up in actual team battles and having ranks, yes even in casual, the serious aspect overpowers this open mind for ridiculousness. Suddenly people are locked in a server and with a set team, meaning if someone decides to go friendly you’re at a disadvantage and inclined to rage in order to achieve that boost of xp.My main argument with all of this is, since we already have an actual serious matchmaking competitive module in place that people wanted. Why the foray into making a “casual” one, where you force everyone else who DOES NOT want to play it into playing it but without it mattering thus defeating its very purpose and bringing about a existence that nobody really wants at all.And finally! The cascade of arguments with community servers… Just no, do not be so obstinate and forlorn. Those of you who use that argument have no right demanding any sort of official competitive either from Valve as there’s community competitive modes and matchmaking out there. Oh? You don’t like the specific rules? Well guess what, the very same issues are just as valid for those of us looking for fun pub games. Let me be clear about this. A valve server is like a public park where every player is bound by the same rules that they’re all aware. Meanwhile a community server is like a private yard where the owner can manipulate, advertise or just outright cheat – leaving you there powerless.Those of you professing exultation are dead wrong, my focal point is how the game has declined in terms of playability and options – which can only be wrong as we all know how toxicity will only increase with the “seriousness” and ranks. Keep it optional is all I wish! We already got one comp mode, fantastic! Great! No need to annihilate the game then with another casual one. Return the pubs and allow us to actually choose ourselves what we want to play instead of forcing us into this limbo. I understand the need to “bring the game up to date” with the generic and superficial traits found in the other titles – but do not rip the very soul of the game doing it.			"

												There is pretty much a reason for anyone, and I mean anyone to play Team Fortress 2. Let's review. If you like to play with fire, and not have to seek professional counseling. Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you like to stab people in the back while smoking a cigarette and speaking in an outrageous French accent. Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you like to run around and hit people with a bat, while talking like a cast member from ""Jersey Shore"". Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you've ever said to yourself: ""I want to build guns, but I also have a life long dream to beat another man to death with a wrench,"". Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you've ever wanted to pretend you're an obese Vladmir Putin while simultaniously firing an ridiculous machine gun. Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you've ever wanted to behead people while in a drunken Scottish rage, Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you've ever wanted to sound like that one kid's dad who told war stories and never shuts up about America, and shoot people with a rocket launcher, Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you want to prove that the plural of the word ""Sniper"" is ""Too damned many"", Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you've ever wanted to pretend you're a Doctor that barely escaped trial at Nuremberg, Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. Finally, if you like hats...be they fancy, or shabby...Team Fortress 2 is a game for you.			"

												I have played this game for a lot of years. During that time I have met a lot of great people, and also quite a bunch of people who I wish I'd never meet.Unfortunately, I've joined the scene quite late as I first started playing this in January 2011, a point where the game was still optimized and still fun. As years passed by I've seen the game go downhill more and more each update. The performance of the game was getting worse and the content Valve kept adding was not contributing to the game one single bit, if anything it just killed more and more frames on a lot of machines, no matter how powerful they are.The latest update ""Meet your Match"" was the final straw for me. Them replacing pub servers with ""Casual"" servers, which are basically pubs with a competitive setting really didn't do it for me. Competitive could've kept this game alive if they implemented this years ago. If you ask me, they are way too late with doing this and I personally do not see a future for this game anymore.If anyone would ask me, I would not recommend Team Fortress 2 to anyone. Even though I have never played Overwatch, I'd say that game holds a much greater future than TF2 would ever achieve.EDIT: Well then, to my surprise they're actually doing something about this whole issue. Way to go, I guess?EDIT 2: My opinion still stands. This game is nothing but a broken pile of ♥♥♥♥.EDIT 3: I moved over to Overwatch, much better game than TF2. Get it now, seriously.			"

												After having accumulated over 1,000 hours of total playtime in this game, I think I can give a well-informed critique of my thoughts on this.If you have a Steam account and you haven't picked up this game, there's clearly something wrong with you. Maybe, or it's just not your cup of tea. Anyways.Team Fortress 2 is a fast-paced, action-packed multiplayer class-based FPS that excels at what it does. With nine distinct classes, each with their own expansive set of weapons, cosmetics, and other such items, the game is infintely customizable and can be perfectly suited to anyone's particular playstyle. Each class offers their own unique strategies that players can take to the battlefield, and even different combinations of weapons can entirely change a class' dynamics.This game has now seen 9+ years of post-launch updates, fanbase growth, and overall community support, so if you're jumping in for the first time, you'll have no shortage of content. Of course, a couple of the game's main features (such as trading, obtaining hats, and unboxing crates for randomized loot) are locked behind a paywall, but that still doesn't take away from the core meat of the game; you can still jump into a game, enjoy the frenzied 12v12 battles between the RED and the BLU team, and ultimately leave satisfied. And if that doesn't fulfill your appetite for this game, there is plenty more to do! Once again, the community has had 9+ years to grow and flourish, so you can surely bet your booty that you'll find something that fits your fancy!However, I will point out that, as of this moment, I'd say TF2 has seen better times. With slightly lackluster updates, long wait times between different updates and other media, and a sadly-botched Competitive matchmaking system, it's clear to see that TF2 is pretty much past its prime. However, that does not mean that TF2 is a bad game! Far from it! Even after the 4 years I have spent playing this game, I still come back to it, even after I get a new game or something! It's because of my love and appreciation for this game after years of service, the friends I've made while playing it, and the growth I've obtained as a gamer that I still come back to this little 2007 gem known as Team Fortress 2.Get this game. Trust me; if you stick with it long enough, it'll change you. I'll see you in the Badlands.			"

												Team Fortress 2. Being ranked as the third most-played game[steamcharts.com] on Steam, Team Fortress 2 is probably one of the best free-to-play games we've got.First off, the obvious: It's free. 100% free. This means its accessible to everyone on Steam. Team Fortress 2 usually consists of two teams (Red and Blue) going head to head against each other. Sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other. There are many, many maps and modes, such as Payload, Capture Points, and Mann VS Machine. But the general idea no matter the map or mode is to KILL EVERYTHING THAT MOVES! And my god, is it fun to do so. The game has 9 playable mercenaries, each actually being a certain ""class"". Each class is divided into 3 different roles: Offense, Defense, and Support. Let's go over each role and class.Offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team. These are your main attack force. Scouts are the speedy hit and run class, with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items. Soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers, which gives them not only power, but mobility due to the ability known as ""rocket jumping"". The Pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire, as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast. Defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map. Overall, the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups. Demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by. Heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces. Heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off. Engineers can build Sentry Guns for effective area defense, as well as build Teleporters and Dispensers for logistical support of the team.Support classes cannot hold the fight on their own, but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their team's favor. They offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game. Whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed, the support classes are always handy to have around. Medics are the team healers, capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments. Spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats. Snipers excel at long range, also eliminating key threats, as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates.Next, let's look at the presentation.TF2 has a very unqiue art style. It's somewhat cartoonish, but very appealing. It's simple, and un-complex. But it doesn't need to be complex. It's simplicity is it's strength. Everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on, what a specific model or item is, and they all stand out. The soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy, especially the main theme. I personally have it as a ringtone/alarm tone on my smartphone! :)One of the best aspects of TF2 is the Steam Workshop. Users can submit designs for items and weapons, and possibly have them added to the game! A very lucrative sub-market has also emerged from this game in the form of the Crate Keys. That's a whole different ballgame in and of itself, so we won't get into it here. During normal gameplay on most servers, you can obtain random items, weapons, and sometimes crates, and taunts....through the item drops system. You can only receive so many drops per week, and you will get them randomly as you play. You can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenary's loadout, or you can use them to craft other items, hats, and weapons. You can take multiples of items and craft them into Scrap, then Reclaimed Metal, then Refined Metal. You can then use these metals to craft specific class weapons/items, among other things. The crafting system is simple yet robust, with lots of possiblities. Some of it is very luck based. You can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the Steam Market!All-in-all, Team Fortress 2 is just a very fun game. Endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game, especially if you play with friends on your favorite server. Probably the best free-to-play game on Steam.			"

Summary:If I had to summarize Tf2 in one sentence, I'd say it's one of the most entertaining, balanced, and relaxing games to play. Pros:From the moment I laid my eyes on this game a year ago, I literally haven't played any other game besides it. The 3 things that seprate it from all the FPS games out there are it's:1. Great communityThe Tf2 community is very friendly, and you can always find people to play with and hang out with on servers, from group hosted events to just chilling out with your friends.2. Balanced classesThe balance between classes is another thing that makes this game the way it is. There is a counter for pretty much any weapon, so it's a battle of skill and prediction. 3. Everlasting entertainment It's almost impossible to get bored of this game because of the hundreds of weapons and styles to play each class that exist, from trolling engies to tryhard soldiers to spawncamping demos. There's also hundreds of maps and gamemodes to play as well, so the fun never ends.Cons:Error, not found.Rating:All in all, hugely recommended for any experienced or new gamers. Try it out, and I guarantee you won't be dissapointed! 10/10Edit: Hats make you a pro at this game.			"

 trash community  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/138912701/badplayerslain.txt 2 bad updates a year  dev team doesn't even play the game, nor do they communicate with the community at all its been almost 2 years since the last weapon release, which were boring, uninspired, and offered nothing new to the game truck loads of more bad cosmetics and skins that don't fit TF2's art style in the slightest tons of high quality, well-designed weapons that have been the highest rated since the steam workshop's inception still not in the game overhyped and barely functional ""competitive mode"" (that you have to pay for if you don't give steam your phone number) that should have been added years ago mvm left to rot for years medieval mode left to rot for even longer unusuals, australiums, and other cancerous bling items random crits are still a thing community servers completely unpopulated because of quick play end of the line was awful because valve wouldn't let them add anything meaningful, which set the standard for future community ""updates"" you can no longer join valve servers through the server browser bugs, horrible optimization, and major game balance issues lingering for years on end  it took 5 years to nerf the degreaser it took almost 5 years to fix being able to store the gunslinger's 3rd punch by hitting teammates (minor and situational bug, yes, but this is just one example of bugs taking ages to fix) sv_pure 1 is still completely broken and crashes your game if you join a server using it with mods installed. additionally, harmless mods such as weapon animation replacers are not allowed by it l m a o box is still running rampant (nice censoring valve) shortstop's perfectly balanced, main functionality which was 20% more health from all sources when deployed, replaced by an entirely new mechanic (able to push players on alt fire), which could have been used on a new weapon, basically a ♥♥♥♥ you to the people who want new weapons bazaar bargain still lightyears ahead of every other sniper rifle for over a year now countless weapons still garbage since release heavy is still a joke class spy buff LOL medic buff LOL "

												It could use a tiny bit more love from the devs but overall it's a fantastic game, the classes are balanced, but if you are going to play you should definitley play a tutorial, TF2  has something for everyone, that's what's so great.  You want to be a medic?  You got it.  You wanna' be a sniper?  You got it.  Wanna' be sneaky?  You got it.  Wanna' blow up stuff up?  You got it.  Wanna' be a walking talking mini gun?  You got it.  Wanna' be a Texan sentry gun?  You got it.  Wanna' shoot flames so much that the enemies hate you?  You got it.  Wanna' run around super fast and be a pest to the enemy?  You sure as hell got it.  Thousands of community maps, lots of maps, lots of different game mode with tonnes of mods to play on!  A (mostly) helpful community who will love having you around?  You get it, most of the time.  Honestly, give it a shot, it has its flaws, but what doesn't?  Overall, you won't be disappointed.			"

Note: This review is made by someone who:  hasn't played this game's predecessor, Team Fortress Classic, yet. Team Fortress 2 is by far the most fun you can have online, a whole new micro universe of gaming experiences and endless possibilities.   Basic info.  	Genre:	 	Action	 	Single-player	   	Multi-player	 	✔	 	Steam features:	 	Achievements	 	✔	 	518	 	Inventory	 	✔	 	Workshop	 	✔	 	Trading cards	 	✔	Brief summary	In Team Fortress 2, the player can choose to play as 9 different character classes, all of which feature a unique set of attributes, customizable weapons and special equipment, join a team of other players and either compete with an opposing team for a principal objective or cooperate with their teammates against an AI.  Critical commentary | Essential value: ★★★★★★★—  Pros & Cons  	Pros:	    It's an examplatory multiplayer FPS game.  It's F2P.  The cartoon-like in-game graphics are cool.  The soundtrack is really amazing.  It's an excellent way to get socialised and to meet fellow gamers, since its community is gigantic and evergrowing.  There are at least 2-3 major updates per year, including annual Halloween and Christmas events, and several bug fixes once in a while.  It features 500+ well-made Steam Achievements.  It provides the player with the ability to adapt the characters' loadouts to their personal combat preferences and capabilities by fully customizing them, as well as to dress their mercenaries with several cosmetic items. Thus, they are able to create an ideal combination of items that will maximize their potential.  There are multiple types of game categories (including Capture the Flag, Control Point, King of the Hill, Payload etc), as well as various maps and levels, and as a result it's almost impossible for the player to get bored.   	Cons:	    It requires money in order to upgrade your account to premium, to buy most of the fancy, nonetheless useless and unnecessary, gear and, in general, to take part in the main economic system.  At the beginning, it seems difficult and complicated due to the vast variety of weapons, equipment and cosmetic items, maps and locations. However, the more you play the game, the easier and the simpler it becomes.   It may become extremely addictive.    Scoreboard | Overall score: 95 out of 100    	Analysis	 	Score	 	Story

												Meet Your Match. They were going in the right direction with Competitive Matchmaking, but they took a hard turn with Valve pubs and combined them into their own setting called Casual Matchmaking, which doesn't even work most of the time. Searches are slow, you'll be placed into servers out of your area, hackers have still not been dealt with, and the constant unnecessary customization blacklists (weapons, animations, sounds, models, FX, the list goes on).Performance hasn't been getting better either. The game is so poorly optimized to the point where you have to run DX8 for high frames and minimal input lag, and yet Competitive Matchmaking forces your game to run in DX9+. Great.My favorite thing about tf2 was when you boot it up, look through the server list, find a game mode/map you want to play and join the server. This process usually takes less than a minute. After the Meet Your Match update, now you have to wait in a matchmaking queue for a minimum of 2 minutes to find a game, and that's ANY game mode and map. This may not be an issue in America where it's very populated but in Australia we don't have the biggest audience. There's not a lot of variety in Community Servers either. You'll mainly find minecraft_trade, achievement_idle, UGC-Gaming (which are generally laggy because their servers never restart/reboot), 24/7 Dustbowl/Hightower (oh, boy), Hitler's Jewfort (which is always populated with abusive admins), and that 1% of vanilla servers with hardly any players.This is what I want from the TF2 Team: Performance and Optimization update, the return of Valve Pubs (which shouldn't be a problem, you can keep Casual Ranking exclusively for Valve Pubs), and updated VAC. They should be working on these problems while the community creates content for the game. I say this because there are already several community updates in the making, and they look very promising. We've got the Mayann Project,[www.mayannproject.com] the Iron Gauntlet,[facepunch.com] and the Frontline[frontline.tf] update. You should check them out.I disagree with everything Valve has done with the past few updates, but that doesn't mean I don't recommend the game. It's not unplayable, it's just not as great as it use to be. Hopefully Valve will change their minds about their recent decisions.			"

												Some of the idiots in the review section are about as ignorant as there is, claiming that the Meet Your Match update ""killed TF2"" and that ""Valve don't care about the community"". Honestly, after all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Valve have been going through, I don't blame them if they couldn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the community, most of us are a bunch of entitled jerks who overhype at pretty much everything. Ironically, it's the community right now thats making TF2 lesser of what it used to be. Sure, I'll be honest, I don't prefer the new system. I think it's clunky and tedious, but unless I'm playing with friends, I go on community servers, so it doesn't really affect me. The reason I'm making this review is to address some of the nonsense being thrown at Valve.Right now you have 3 options. Casual servers which are basically the non-competitive version of competitive, Competitive servers, and Community servers. People complain that Casual servers are filled with idiots that don't know how to play. So basically they're implying that before this update, the servers weren't filled with idiots.Team Fortress 2 is still a huge game thats introducing dozens of players all the time, of course you're bound to get people new to the game, but that somehow makes them an idiot? I do agree however that it can take a while to find a server, whereas the previous system was much quicker.Competitive gets complains of hackers and cheaters being in every match, and that it's best to play with friends because people you don't know are ♥♥♥♥. First off, I've never seen a single hacker or cheater, and I've played quite a bit of Competitive. I've won many games with people I don't know, and honestly don't see why I'd lose if the people I was with, were actually good. It isn't perfect, but hell it's nowhere near as bad as people say it is.And Finally Community servers. The servers that people claim are ""toxic"". Funny thing is, because of this update, Casual and Comp servers are much more toxic than community servers, due to people complaining about the most pathetic of things, blaming their failure on other people and claiming they suck at the game. Most of my playtime is spent on community servers, and I've made some pretty good friends on there. I agree, they're not perfect. Some are absolutely horrible, filled with advertisements, awful admins and some are just the centre of scam, but I'd much rather go on these right now, than even touch Casual or Competitive.So for people wondering, the Meet Your Match update has NOT killed TF2. Valve isn't killing TF2, Overwatch isn't killing TF2, cheaters and hackers aren't killing TF2, It Is YOU, the community, that is killing it. This is what happens when people overhype on something that really isn't worth overhyping. It's made people completely bitter and pretty much mock everything Valve does, when Valve are trying to save the game. The game is still unbalanced, you still get jerks on either team calling you a noob, you still get everything you got before but you're just going to have to put up with how you play. I still play the game today, by myself and with friends, and still get plenty of fun out of it, but this update is one the prime examples of what overhyping can result in. I feel sorry for the new players who have to put with us jerks. Rant over.			"

												TF2 is the oldest game that I've been playing for a long time ( I've been playing since I started Steam, which was late 2014, to be exact). While Valve has made several ♥♥♥♥ups in the past (*cough* Meet Your Match *cough*), TF2 Still manages to be an amazing game, that's free as well.PROS:9 Diverse classes with interchangeable weaponsSeveral communities (Trading, Mann vs. Machine, etc.)One of a kind graphics (amazing for 2007 standards, and still holds up today.)You can get all weapons just by playing the game (You can buy non-stock items on the Valve Store [Not worth it], Buy them for around 1 cent by trading, or buy them with the Community Market, which can possibly count player kills as well [usually far cheaper than the Steam Store]} Community servers add new gamemodes and mapsYou can make hundreds of friends (I've made several for sure)NEUTRAL:Most community servers have some plugins (EG: skial, PF2)Microtransactions (While the game is not P2W, there are some microtransactions (keys) that can be used as currency for the trading economy, or can be used to get said stranges or even ""unusuals"", which are hats (or guns) that have a certain ""effect"" with them. Some are as cheap as 10 keys (~$18.5) to over 1000 keys (~$1850).CONS:Some communities are toxic as hell (*Cough* Jiggly's Fun House)Hitboxes aren't that good (Not terrible, however)Since the game became Free to Play (mid 2011), the average skill level (and player age) decreased tremendouslyGeneral TF2 Discussions is a gigantic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Is this game wasn't F2P, the rating would be lower, oddly.9/10, Although it's not as good as it once was, it's a must get for everyone  (It's free!)

												This game is really great.It's balanced for a start.You can pick scout, and practically do negative damage to enemies on meatshot.You can pick soldier, and choke badly when you sneak up on someone.You can pick pick pyro, and have a hand to spare.You can pick demoman, and break your mouse's left and right click.You can pick heavy, and get high degree lead poisoning from the amount of bullets in your head.You can pick engie, and sit on your ♥♥♥ all day.You can pick medic, and drop uber. Every. Damn. Time.You can pick sniper, and get camped by every spy in a 5 mile radius.You can pick spy, and -OH HOW IS THAT NOT A BACKSTAB!?Oh... Random crits are still a thing?Yeah this game's alright.			"

												I used to love this game but - I am sorry to say this, I truly am because it is a shame to see such a good thing wasted - it is over. ruined. period. What's fun about recieving a penalty for leaving a casual match? I understand it being so for competitive mode but casual as well? What if I don't like the map or have a hacker on the server? Just a few days ago I was being headshot by an ambassador spy hacker and now you are telling me I might be stuck with one of those and not able to leave? The whole idea behind TF2 was that no one gives a f*** and everyone is having a good time. It was never meant to be ""balanced"" or taken seriously. It was just for fun and that is what attracted so many people - being able to do bad and still enjoy the game. But as time passed all the dumb weapons, hats, crates - the game became a money-juicer until Valve just nailed TF2 to a cross with the new update. Well done.			"

												PROS:- Hats.- Free to play.- Strong community.- Graphics and caricatures.- Community and user-generated contents.- Lifetime support and updates confirmed (it is Valve.)CONS:- Hats (sick of them.)- Lack of tribute to id and Quake.- Internet memes and half-brained UGC.- More players means inevitably more kids and toxic players, too (statistically speaking.)EDIT: For those typical lowlife kids with extremely low intelligence who fail to grasp the language and understand the review in its entirety, read the part where It says STATISTICALLY SPEAKING. The word kid has a negative connotation especially in gaming communities becuase kids are more likely to be toxic than adult gamers in general. It is the fact that kids are immature and that immaturity is the source of all problems and annoyance so you cannot argue against it. If you are a kid but you think you don't belong to the lowest common denominator, good for you; then there is no reason to get offended. Otherwise, grow the ♥♥♥♥ up and ♥♥♥♥ off. Strictly speaking, this game is rated M for MATURE.Final Remarks:I pre-ordered The Orange Box back in 2007 and I have watched from the start how Team Fortress 2 (TF2) evolved into something perpetual thingy and Valve's flagship of their both economically and experimentally successful multiplayer game (now of course DotA2 and CS:GO have risen to stand along and they all pretty much surpassed it.) Do you realize how monumental this game was (and seemingly still is) to gamers and even to Valve themselves? Steam Achievement and later drop system along with hats were first introduced for TF2. I remember when hat phenomenon was all over the place and everyone wanted Fancy Fedora so much.Here is one fun story about the game; A guy from SourceOP known as Drunken F00l got VAC-banned for making idling tool for TF2 and for cheating an event item known as Golden Wrench. Including him, people who used idling tool got their hats and items taken away meanwhile all other active TF2 players were awarded with Halo hats for not using the tool. But after sometime the ban on the SourceOP guy was lifted and he officially started working at Valve for his TF2 Backpack and something more. Well, that guy had talent and Valve definitely knew about it so they decided to hire him in spite of all violations of user agreements as a Steam user. It reminds me of the FBI hiring a genius financial fraudster and there is even a movie about it. So much drama over TF2, aye? You see, this game just has so many interesting stories to tell.When TF2 switched to F2P model, the community even got bigger and stronger than ever before and it is still growing even after many years have passed. All official updates and endless user-created contents enrich the game; more drops, more hats, more weapons, more maps, more Halloween and holiday events, more updates, more everything, and now skins and competitive matchmaking system just like in CS:GO; OMG VOLVO. And its market is being sustained on its own economy. Quite amazing. I personally no longer play this game anymore because I already played enough of it, but it is easily understandable why this game is still one of the most played games on Steam.. RECOMMENDED .			"

												I made my Steam account specifically for TF2 back in the day, and there was a long time I'd just play this game for 8 hours every day of the week. I loved TF2 to death, I can still remember how happy I was when I first found a hat or when I uncrated something good. The best part, though, was the frequent and amazing updates this game brought out. It seemed every month we got new weapons or maps. Halloween used to be absolutely fantastic, every year you'd have some amazing new map and gamemode with a horde of halloween items to earn. Christmas usually added new weapons, summer added all sorts of stuff, plus just general huge updates and events. It was great.Those days are completely gone though. This year we didn't get a halloween update, we didn't get a christmas update and the team has been making some really weird choices for the game lately. Competetive was basically dead on arrival, it was broken for months after release too, and casual games have been changed to be a lot less casual. I feel like the team has no idea what they're doing, if they're even doing anything at all. The last fun thing they attemped was a class war between pyro and heavy, in which the winner would get new content, but even that was utterly lackluster. The war itself was just a meter filling up, until pyro won, and that's that. What about the new content for pyro? Pretty sure they forgot about it, and even when it comes it'll likely be completely broken. Team Fortress 2 just feels dead. In the haydays it was incredibly lively, something was happening every day, there was so much I hadn't even tried yet. Now nothing ever changes, if it does it's for the worse and every seasonal event is utter disappointment.I have no idea how this game can have almost the biggest playerbase on steam, bring in one of the highest revenues on steam and be so captivating that everyone I know has over a thousand hours clocked, yet still have such a tiny and unqualified dev team. I know it must be disheartening for the people who work on this to see die-hard fans like myself berating them like this, but they must know that they're failing the fanbase. I know of a modded server run by two people that push out ten times the content the official developers do, and it's better quality too. Step up your game.			"

												Hey kids! Remember when Team Fortress 2 was a class-based shooter?Remember the good old times where you could choose the maps you wanted to play on?Remember the good old times where you didn't have to wait 40 minutes in a queue to play a game that lasts about 2 minutes?Well, Valve says:  No more! In all serious however - this last update is the finishing stroke for TF2. I still cannot believe what they did to this game i played for about two years by now, which i loved and cherished, before it basically pushed the middlefinger into their players faces. This game used to be fun, now it just feels awfully competitive, like a competition really, even in a gamemode called ""Casual""There is nothing casual about any of this anymore.As I'm writing this, i sit in a queue to play on a map i didn't even choose with people i didn't even choose, get sorted into a team i didn't even choose. The longest time i have been waiting to get into a game was over an hour. And once i WAS sorted in, i played one round which was about 2 minutes long. I get experience points, i get disconnected, i wait again. Forty minutes until i am in the next game, same scenario. Honestly, i am thinking about deinstalling TF2 after this. Because i seriously loose all my patience, interest and support for this game  "

												This is probably the only game I will ever need. It's the game that got me into PC gaming and it's the game that has the best community out of the biggest games. Mainly because it's not a toxic community. Just like CS there is so much to do in them because of all the left in glitches and wierd game mechanics. It's also free wich makes it easy to play with friends wich is one of the best things.Thanks for bringing me this game!			"

												Positive review because even though the wall of text is 100% negative, we need you all to keep playing and voice your opinions loudly so that Valve will do something about the horrible mess they've created.The meet your match update was a mistake, the community has been in a constant state of outrage, outcry, and complete and total dismay, and all Valve has done about it is put on their fake god damn business smile and say, ""We're sorry. We'll band-aid some of the minor problems right away,"" without even acknowledging the one, MAJOR f*ckup, removing Valve pubs and the Quickplay system in general.Quickplay was not only for Valve pubs. It was also used by many to find community servers. One of those networks that was highly affected by Quickplay lost 70% OF THEIR PLAYERBASE over the last few weeks. I'm talking about TF2 APP. They are shutting down this Saturday. Because Valve won't acknowledge the one major problem with this update. They won't even say ""We're sorry about pubs."" They won't say anything. If you wanna know exactly how kill your own game, just grab some ♥♥♥♥in' popcorn and watch. The ABSOLUTE most frustrating thing a company can do is completely ignore the entire customer base's main complaint about a product/update. This is how you drive out old players, and discourage new ones from coming in. It isn't rocket science, Valve. This game is 9 years old, man. Up until last month, it STILL had a concurrent 60,000 players. We're loyal as hell. We are loud as hell, but that doesn't make us less loyal. Speak to us with your mouth words, Valve. Use phonetic syllables to make sounds that our human ears will recognize, ALTERNATIVELY, use your fingers to press the buttons on your keyboard that would make up those aforementioned phonetic syllables. It's literally that simple. Open your god damn mouths and stop being so silent. The age old excuse of ""we just dont wanna talk about stuff until we're sure it's ready to talk about"" doesn't exactly apply here. It was cute when people were asking about HL3. Now we're talking about whether or not one of the top 10 games on Steam is going to die, by your own hands. Get off your asses.			"

												Team Fortress 2 was launched in 10/10/2007.As years went by,Valve made more and more hats,and people complained that too much effort was given into cosmetic items and less into the gameplay,the game was turning into Hat Fortress 2,and people claimed the game was dying,even though Valve constantly updates their game with gameplay content,like maps,modes,new weapons,and bug fixes.As years went by,Valve made more and more promotions for pre-ordering a game and getting items for TF2,and people claimed the game was dying,even though you usually can get these items without paying and most are just cosmetic items.As years went by, new gameplay content was being made more by the community, while Valve focused more into the cosmetic content, and the game was dying because Valve left the game for us to improve.Pretty much everytime the game gets a balance patch, with classes and weapons being nerfed or buffed, people say the game is dead, usually people that loved that weapon that was nerfed.On 5/20/2009, a new weapon was showed, the Jarate, a Sniper weapon that is just a jar full of urine that he throws, people complained that Valve was being kiddy and adding immature toilet humor, and the game was dead because of that, also, Jarate now is considered the best Sniper secondary weapon.Also, the next day, 5/21/09,the game got its first 9 hats,people probably marked that day as when the game became a ""Hat Simulator"",and the game died.To get those hats, many people started idling,don't play the game and just wait for the hats to come with the new item drop system, some players, even made programs designed especially to idle, but in 9/2/09, Valve decided to take away all the items from players that used those programs, and reward the players who didn't with a halo for you to wear, people that got their items taken were infuriated, and the community was really divided, servers started banning people who weared the halo, and there were other servers banning those who didn't, and the game, was dead for many, many people, also, idling persists to this day.In 6/10/10, the game got the Mac Update, that made TF2 playable on MAC OS X, this angried many people, especially Apple haters, but what made the biggest complaints, were the Earbuds, earbuds similar to those made by Apple, and you got one by playing the game on MAC OS X during some days, just that item made the community rage and ban players that used it, there was a petition to remove the item, and the game was dead again, most people just logged into a Mac to get the item and continue playing on Windows.On 9/30/10 the game got a store for microtransactions, people claimed the game was dead, because now we had to pay to win the matches, even though we never had, getting weapons that change gameplay is easy, you can easily trade weapons you don't want for one you want, expensive and rare weapons are just reskins, and the cosmetic items don't change anything, they're just decoration, there was a time where some hats combined with some weapons gave you bonus stats, but that stopped a long time ago.On 6/23/11, the game became Free to Play, people claimed the game was dead because now the game would be full of noobs and annoying players, like if other multiplayer games didn't have the same issue, and like everyone started a good player,some people even asked for refunds like they deserved their money back,people raged because your only reward for paying for the game was an ugly hat that proves it,when you also were instantly given a premium account, that has some advantages over free players,but no advantages in actual competition.On 9/6/11,Steam Trading came,and people complained that Valve was going too far into allowing people to trade games for hats,and the game was dying.On 2/14/12, the game got a new item, the ""Something Special For Someone Special"", a wedding ring that costs $99.99,goes to two different players and it's a sign of engagement between them,people claimed the game was turning into some sort of dating simulator and the game was dying.On 6/27/12, came the Meet the Pyro short along with the Pyroland mode,and people again claimed the game was dead due to Valve making the game cute and cuddly and making the Pyro even more crazy than we thought. On 8/15/12,the game got the Mann vs. Machine mode,and people claimed Valve was being greedy because there was a mode that required a paid item to play,the Mann Up mode,and the game was dying,even though the only difference in that mode is that you get exclusive cosmetics and reskin weapons.On 1/10/13,it was announced that the original 9 hats from 5/21/2009 were going to be retired,so no one could get new copies of them anymore (Except from old crates),but you could keep the ones you had and trade them,and you could still buy the hats for two weeks before that,the game was dead because Valve was desperate to sell items that weren't selling well,also, Valve never did that again.On 10/29/13, the game got a unicorn hat called ""The Magical Mercenary"", and people claimed the game was dead just because one single hat.On 5/17/13, the Robotic Boogaloo update was released,a community update,and it was just a bunch of robotic versions of cosmetics that the game already had,people claimed Valve didn't care for the game anymore,again,and the game was dying.On 6/17/14, people claimed the game was dead again,because of the Conga,a taunt where players can dance around the map instead of shooting each other.On 10/29/14,the game got some bumper car minigames,people claimed Valve was running out of ideas,the game was turning into Mario Kart,and the game was dead.On 12/8/14,the game got the End of the Line Update,another community update,it was kinda boring,it was heavily focused on ducks,and the map Snowplow was cut because Valve thought it was too complicated,and people claimed the game was dying,also,Snowplow was added later.On 7/2/15,the game started having painted weapons just like CS:GO,and people claimed Valve was adding more and more ways to get easy money,the game was turning into TF:GO,and you had to pay for an item to get these weapons and crates to get them, you were paying to get crates and pay to open them,and the game was dead.On 10/6/2015, the game got the Invasion Update, again made by the community, people claimed the update was boring, not much new content, and again the game was dead, even though it had a new mode.I made this review 12/3/15, and the game didn't look like dead back then, the peak that day was 56,632 people playing.TF2 is set to die again with Blizzard's Overwatch,let's see how that goes,people said the same about World of Warcraft and its clones.12/9/15 came, and the new thing that made the game dead is the trade holds,also called the ESCROW,where you're going to wait 3 days to trade items if one of the two traders don't protect his account on a phone and confirm every trade on it,people even claimed they were leaving Steam.12/17/15 came with the Tough Break Update, and the the game is dead again because of two things I mentioned earlier, because it's just like the Gun Mettle Update where you have to pay to get the reskin weapons and also pay to get crates and then pay to open them, and because of nerfing the Pyro and Demoknight, when you could argue that the Pyro was actually buffed.Well,now it's 6/25/16,Overwatch is been on for a while,and the peak today is 64,208,the game is still not dead,maybe I'll update again next year about that.7/7/16 came with the Meet Your Match Update, and Valve removed their public servers from the game, and their servers only exist in matchmaking, they also removed the quickplay mode, and the game is dead, even though you can still play on community servers and search them with the old server browser.

												Imagine the following scenario:You and a friend enjoy playing chess. Your chessboard is old and warped, and some of the pieces are starting to lose their paint, but who cares? You two have great fun. Suddenly, one day, someone comes up to your board, slaps away all the pieces, and throws down a whole bunch of checker pieces. It just so happens that neither you nor your friend very much care for checkers. Sure, you'd play it from time to time, but you'd much rather just play chess.However, your friend suggests that perhaps you should both just give checkers a chance. ""Alright,"" you say to yourself, ""This isn't so different than how it was before. I can deal with this."" However, upon closer inspection, there aren't enough checker pieces to even play the game properly, and some of them don't even seem to belong to the same set as the rest. You are about to open your mouth to complain, but before you can, the person who destroyed your wonderful chess set pulls down their pants and just craps all over your board. Neither you nor your friend are pleased with this turn of events. You let the strange fellow who interrupted your game know that you don't appreciate it when someone violently destroys your games for no good reason, and they seem to listen. For a moment, you have hope. The stranger leaves, promising to fix what they broke. Soon enough, they return with a shovel. They then diligently scoop away maybe a third of the fecal matter that plagues what used to be a chess board. Afterwards, they wipe the sweat from their forehead, put down their shovel, and clap their hands together. ""There!"" they proudly exclaim, ""All fixed, just like you wanted!""This is the current state of TF2. I used to love this game. I would love this game once more if they bring back quickplay. I would be perfectly fine with their pile of poop checkers sitting comfortably on it's designated side of the room, but only if I have the option to play chess as well.			"

Do i recommend this game? yes, i do. Do i recommend you neglect your family and friends, just to play this game? of couse I do. Do i recommend you give up your life like i have, down to my last 100$ and pack of top ramen, using newspapers as diapers, feeding off compliments that i get for my hats? I think you know the answer to that question.

												I really don't like playing F2P games. That's probably because you must pay every time you want anything. Team Fortress 2 is not like all these pay 2 win games. It's really fun playing it and you don't need to spend 1000 $ per month to have fun from killing other players. For me - it's best Free 2 Play in the world. <3			"

												First of all, I don't really understand why this game isn't as popular as for example CS, cause it's basically the same genre but TF2 disposes of much more diversified gameplay part where ingame scenarios are very variable due to 9 classes available for playing. Maybe some people don't like animation-style graphics but apart from this questionable part, it is perfect multiplayer FPS game I ever played or heard about, highly recommended for all CS nerds tired of ""The bomb has been planted""			"

												This is a well made, stylised, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play. Lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes (each with his or her own distinct personality) to choose from. The banter between the different classes is entertaining to listen to. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow him to fulfil a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or higher skill levels. The game has a somewhat active development team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons, skins or game modes.At the time of this review, there are two official modes of play: player versus player(which consist of Match Making, Casual and Community Servers) and 'Mann Versus Machine'.Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objective or objectives for each team to achieve.'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, ""Mann Up"", gives rewards upon completing a ""tour"".In addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available.In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them. However I DO NOT recommend opening crates!!!The game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play. I have been playing 2014 and I still return to the game on a regular basis.Overall TF2 is a classic but will most likely die out in the next few years unless the development team gets their act together.UPDATE: This game has me coming back to it every single day			"

												Veterans, Superstars and Legends got tired, Admins have gone sour, Kids are spoiled and their parrents missed out on education and the main developers just want a diffrent feedback for once and Forced Positivity is a thing, soon enough saying ""stay positive"" will get you in prison.But enough about that, whats all this have to do with our little game? In truth mostly nothing, over the years with is degrading server system and Hitdetection its still a hilarious and fun game.Whats that? Fun is not a thing in TF2? It does not exist anymore? Well ♥♥♥♥ you pal for there still is and its plenty, just because you like things to be more serious does not mean everyone wants it.Speaking of which maybe some of what I said has a part in this. What do most ""professionals"" say these days, specially about competitive? Well in all my years in this game even competitive was fun no matter what was involved or the costs, at the end of the day even if you lost you still had a smile on your face because you gave it all and god damn was it ♥♥♥♥ing good, the dissapointment does not last forever and only a fool would just give up from one defeat. As someone once said ""A Defeat means nothing if the soul remains unconquered"" and quite frankly I am starting to see that more rarely. What was once a place full of magic, insanity and crazy explosive flying people, multicolored as well, giant fat Bear wrestlers fighting amongst themselves with tickle mittens and australian snipers having a spit contest while the texan and the nazi have a philosicial disscussion about the diffrent ways of murder and how to get away in fashion as the Mumbling freak prepares some weenies for the great BBQ and the boston boy prepares some tunes while scateboarding over the french fry.Has become into a generic Kindergarten game of that one Kid who would invent every counter to your attacks or spells (if people remember the days where stick fights were infact great battles that were more gloryous then the Lord of the Rings stories)...that is also how I envision this community and specially the whole update and competitiveEven before Lobbies were a thing, there was a level..no respect was mandatory, honor and some ♥♥♥♥ing decency for once. Apparently having a ""fashon"" sense makes you unbeatable, have you tried the barbie games? Im pretty sure even they had more sense then what you are making right now.I mean have you seen how most people react? Forget the children, mass media ♥♥♥♥ed them up and specially youtube, filled with horrible memes and terrible ♥♥♥♥ing tips. Nobody is trying anything by themselves its all in the youtube how too's And even their super star youtube players tried at one point to educate them properly but when all fails..I guess we gotta go with the flow...I don't believe in that but I am not them.But whats worseas I said before, forget the children, most of us were stupid one time, but when you see people at the age where thinking should be a thing..no they just repeat what you say, talk ♥♥♥♥ behind you and if you dare tell them about skill they will give you their CV(poorly writen with wank stains(male and female) ) or tell ya why are you not playing competitive then? But the question comes? Why are you not playing competitive? Im pretty sure you can showcase your skill a lot better there with people of your level...but whats Ironic is that even there..there is no such thing as skill, you'd expect some level of power but really, that exclusiveness, that specialty in team building the idea of actual competitive has been dumbed down like ♥♥♥♥ing hell, to the point competitive and casual are not so diffrent, and really Casual should practically be like in MvM, a boot camp for competitive..but it became such a casual thing itself ( mind the pun please ) it became nothing more then a simple and stupid word..hell even a Insult for that matter. So who means what anymore?In Team Fortress 2 this update means nothing, for its just a update folks, change happens anyway, remember the time with the quick play? It replaced community servers with vanilla, at first it aint so bad, but in that time would you all have believed me if I would say that this would cause a lot of players to consider the Server Browers a very complicated system? I wouldn't..and even now I don't.. everybody complaining before the community is dead( not bit soup rice)..but why did you not server browse? Its still a thing you know..whats that? ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Plugins and crappy advertisements? there is adblock you know, it works in games as well..but thats valves problem..no..thats not 100% valves problem..what does ""community server"" mean to you? I want you to think deeply, im not going to force you to write me a essay on that, your a big boy now so get busy doing something then pretending you are depressed for attention okay? Thank you.Unusuals...where do I even begin..before I hated those hats, I started around the time it became f2p, I wanted to buy the game myself but when it became free I was happy but low and Behold I learned about the f2p curse..but..to speak truly I never could understand what was so bad infact my f2p times were the best ever...oh I'm turning into a old man speaking jibberish again..ahem..Even unusuals have lost their value..no not economical value..that was lost years ago when Backpack.tf2 cought power..I still regret the day I used to be a vigilante trade moderator..im pretty sure the exact same people I helped are using bots to ship stolen unusuals half their price on Scrap.tf2 (yes,thats where most ♥♥♥♥ goes btw, pay attention) but their stance..their emotional and god damn aspect has decreased over time. What was once a item that simbolizes uniqueness, specialty and power..that would give sometimes the wearer a effect that would turn even a Worm into a Super Mega Ultra Legend...now its just a hat with a Michael Bay special effect..these things get stolen, thrown and rebought..hell even unboxing one must not feel the same anymore..all the economical mish mash destroyed it..its a shame really... I usually say ""A thing that becomes too comercial, grows in economical value, but loses everything else that made it seem special"", have a new unusual that nobody has ever unboxed? wait around 2 weeks, someone will dupe it or steal it through the dumbest ways possible and there will be so many people who have had this hat it will become as bland as this community.Have you noticed a pattern here? Ive never said anything bad about the game other then the actual issue, the servers and hitscan. This game still is and will forever be great, nothing will beat it 100%, not because it uses special features or has incredible graphics. But because of its charm, the way it touched people (clean thoughts people, clean thoughts) there may be a game that can beat its performance, its looks, maybe even its economic system, but it will never take away its image, its soul..which even to this day it brings people back to play once a while.I still love this game..love, not like, love.Despite the years, the abuse and changes, the mess ups and horrible community, I recommand this game to all ages,nationalities and galaxies, for this game has a endless supply of Fun that no wanna be pompous ♥♥♥♥♥♥ will ever take...P.S. I am super ♥♥♥♥ing surprised how I did not swear like a mother♥♥♥♥ing sailor here..usually ♥♥♥♥ is 90% of my vocabulary..but ♥♥♥♥ me was this a little too honest from the depth of my mushy ♥♥♥ heart.P.S.2 Remember what I said about all ages? No children, Why? Multiplayer games are bad kids, its filled with failures, come back when Honor and respect is a thing again. But that dont mean you should not play singleplayer games or games over your age. I was no better. I was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in my time.			"

												This game is PC gamer's essential. The art style is unique and appealing. The gameplay varies dramatically from map to map, requiring the player to create new strategies and work with their team in order to succeed. The community is also a nice bunch of people. The game has it's own charm, that keeps a big, goofy smile on your face the whole time you play it, maybe it's the art style, or the personalities of each classes, and maybe it's how the game sort of make fun of itself and takes itself so un-seriously. There are frequent updates that keep adding new items and features that get the whole community excited for a good reason, these new items can throw a real curve ball in the right situation. Lastly, it's F2P! So what are you waiting for, go and fire up steam and download it now, you will not regret it.			"

												The biography of the TF2 soldier:A Highly-Trained Weapon Specialist Soldier that went on a killing spree in WW2 (World War 2) that presently wields an RPG FOR A PRIMARY WEAPON joined a team of mercenaries to defeat another team of mercenaries exactly like them, soon, became roomates with A WIZARD that can spawn PUMPKIN HEADED HEADLESS HORSEMANS, A GIANT EYEBALL that shoots exploding miniature eyeballs, A magic book that CASTS BOMB SPELLS, soon turned against the soldier. And one day while on a camp fire he saw a comet that literally landed in front of him only to see that inside the ""comet"" was AN INTERDIMENSIONAL PARTICLE SMASHER that he soon used as a weapon. And also one day a crazed man built an entire ARMY OF ROBOTS to take down the mercenaries exactly in the likenesses of the mercenaries themselves, so technically... he can defeat his own self with his own weapons but in the form of metal, batteries, and also probably about 5 TIMES HIS OWN SIZE. Oh and he also survived a winter cold day COMPLETELY NAKED WHILE WRESTLING A BEAR WHILE HE IS COVERED IN HONEY, and when I say completely naked.. I mean COMPLETELY, INCLUDING NO UNDERWEAR. Oh and also he shoots his own rockets at his feet to propel himself in the air. Have you ever heard of him surviving being under fire, comepltely filled with LED bullets WHILE COVERED IN URINE, yes, covered IN URINE. And also he used a shovel to fight a fat man holding a minigun point blank while the soldier is in mid-air who won? Obviously the man with a shovel. I think thats probably nuff said...

Once upon a time, people played videogames. They played them for entertainment, for fun with friends, or just as a way to relax. They were a universal standard of passing the time without really bothering to do anything at all.And that's the way things stayed. Until one day, someone decided that instead of just hopping in to a game once in a while to enjoy yourself, you had to commit hours and hours to tirelessly enduring match after match after endless match just to keep your skill at a level that can compete with anyone else in the server.That's not just an excuse to play more, thank you very much Mother, it's a valid reason.So now we have a breed of video games played not for fun but for competition, and for a while that was working fine! Those who wanted to excel dedicated themselves to the activity whilst the rest of us tried, rather miserably, to muster any skill that we could out of our digits (or rather, those whose fingers have yet to succumb to the inevitable fate of RSI and arthritis) in an attempt to keep up - at least, as best we could.Then some idiot decided to make Team Fortress 2.Originally, it was released as part of the Orange Box as a sequel to a Quake mod called ""Team Fortress"", and was an interesting concept with 9 unique classes to choose to play. It became quite a fun, addictive game with a fairly healthy player base. Then, after it received a few hundred updates and a change to Free-To-Play, people took what was now essentially the worlds first War-Themed Hat Simulator and thought ""Y’know what? I’m bored of showing people how ignorant my parents are with what I’m doing with their credit cards. I want to play this to WIN.""It became a fun, addictive game with a decent player base; in-app purchases with hundreds of cosmetics, a trading economy, a modding community, numerous community gamemodes such as surfing and prop hunt; a competitive community, a very high skillcap requiring huge amounts of time an commitment to master, and updates to keep the content fresh.AND IT’S FREE (if you don’t count the millions that you end up spending on hats that you never thought you’d ever want)I want my life back :C			"

I agree that it's kind of turning into a CS:GO clone, you can now pick up weapons when they're dropped after someone dies, there's skins of stock weapons, I really miss Valve releasing new Festive skins and I do not like the idea of a Festivizer, and there are no new crates with new Strange weapons, just more cases with more skins and cosmetics and the nerf on some weapons are really unnecessary, it's TF2, not CS:GO, trying to completely balance the weapons in this game is impossible. Overall, it's still my favorite game even though it's losing popularity. Did I regret starting an addiction to this game? Heck no.			"

												Team Fortress 2 is a weird game, and it is not only a FPS game anymore. I would describe it more as a social hub for people to hang out. This game have two teams that are supposed to fight each other, but only in Team Fortress 2 with two people of the opposite team giving each other high fives, stop fighting during the game and walk around crouching, or dance together!There are nine classes divided into three groups; offense, defense and support. But Team Fortress 2 have changed so much since release that it does not really mean anything anymore. Pretty much every class can function as any of the three groups with the right loadout, but they are still very different from each other. You got a fast Scout with little health, and a slow Heavy with a lot of health, and anything inbetween that! There is no way you will not find a class you prefer sticking to.Valve never added a new class, but they added tons of weapons! Some of them are really silly (punch an enemy in the back to make him stop and laugh, a great way to get silly taunt kills!), while others generally are a big improvement over the stock weapons (like the Degreaser). However most of the weapons are very situational and I prefer the stock weapons.There are many game modes to play. Capture the point, capture the flag. Payload where you push a cart through the map while the other team try preventing you from doing it, and if you're a fan of tower defense, you will enjoy Mann Vs. Machine! You're a team of up to six people who are supposed to kill a huge army of robots before they move their bomb to your base. Some of them are small, others are big and really hurts, and others are big and runs fast. But what really makes this game mode different from the more traditional Team Fortress 2, is you can upgrade your weapons. Fire speed, damage, reload speed, damage resistances, running speed, jump speed and so on. It is really fun, and if you are lucky you can win a huge prize for completing a Tour!Cosmetic items are a huge deal for many people. Hats! There are so many hats in this game, and they are all so different. There is no way you are not going to find one you like and will wear and be proud to wear every time you play. Many of the cosmetics can also be painted into your favourite colour!Team Fortress 2 is free to play. Is it pay to win? No. All the weapons you see in the store, are weapons you can get simply by playing, or you can use items to craft the weapon you want. If you buy premium you will receive weapons faster, your backpack will be larger so you can keep more items, and you can trade with others. Trading is a good way to get the weapon you're looking for.It is a lot of fun! It is fun to play the actual game, or just hanging out with people ingame like you can not do in any other game. This is the game where you make friends! ^____^			"

This is an edit of my review posted on Feb 24, 2016. This review is also super-serious and intellectual. You have been warned.Team Fortress 2 used to be my favorite game. It still is, as a matter of fact. There are many good things to be said about this game, and I love the characters, gameplay, art style, etc of the game altogether. Recently, however, Valve has made this game one of my least favorite games I own.TF2 recently recieved the Meet Your Match update, which brought their new Competitive Mode out of beta, as well as changing the casual lobby, balancing weapons, and adding new crates and taunts. Despite the good things that came out of the update, I personally think Valve has destroyed TF2's casual community with the new changes. First of all, the quickplay menu no longer exists. It has been replaced by a ridiculously broken game coordination system that places players on uneven teams. In addition, casual gameplay has drastically become more competitive. I remember times when you could go on a Valve server and screw around dancing with the enemy team. Now there is no time for that, it's all pressure to beat the enemy team's time or capture that one extra point. Map selection is unavailable, as well as autobalance and even simple mechanics like dominations and revenges. Not to mention that hackers cannot be votekicked anymore, and that voting in general is disabled.The second major flaw in this update is the unneccessary balancing, again. Specific weapons being buffed like the Huo-Long Heater and Sun-on-a-Stick changes have been good, however lots of horrible ""balancing"" has been put on weapons that didn't need them in the first place. The Brass Beast and Natascha were nerfed again, making them worse than they were. The Pyro has been buffed again with the ability to interrupt a Medic's healing rate, and the Shortstop now has a shove function which works similarly to an airblast. The Soda Popper is now worse than before with the new function of building Hype on hit rather than on movement. The most surprising part of all this, though, is that the Quickiebomb Launcher and Iron Bomber were both buffed, which makes them more overpowered than even before. Like I said, these changes were mostly unneccessary.The last thing I will go off about in this review is the community. Sure, there are several nice people I have met through TF2, and I am not saying there aren't nice people in the community. But servers I see now are full of micspammers, hackers, people being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and in general nobody working together as a team to complete the objective or otherwise. If you try to tell someone to do something strategic that will work, usually the response is ""♥♥♥♥ you"". I have lost many a match because the team I'm placed on will not cooperate to beat the other team.My point is, TF2 is horrible and practically dead after this new update. I still enjoy it out of long-standing habit, however I do not reccommend picking this game up right now. Unless you love the matchmaking system and skins of CS:GO. This game is not what it used to be, and I am utterly dissappointed to give TF2 a negative review.I rate this game a 6/10. Thanks Valve, for ""listening"" to us and ♥♥♥♥ing up my favorite game of yours even more than it needed to be. "

												Good afternoon, dear gentlemen and gentlewomenIt is a pleasure to perceive that one such as yourself would partake in my review of this most splendorous game. I say this for it is the most honest and veritable truth. Quite close to the objective Idea of Truth, to estimate it properly. At first I held the opinion that Collective Fortification II was merely another dull, boring and uninteresting ludum of the general significance and craftsmanship as Summoning of Obligation. However, this was in advance of the actual attempt at undergoing the experience of Collective Fortification II, which is, in hindsight, presumptuous and bold. Contrary to whatever estimation I conferred to Collective Fortification II in the past before, mind you, partaking in the adventure that is Collective Fortification II, I must declare with due expertise that this ludum is marvelous! In this ludum one will find a most engaging experience worthy of eternal estimation in the irrefutable and absolute realm of Do Desire. Certainly, anyone who would claim that this ludum is not worthy of said realm would be a scoundrel, a fraud and a lout. Yes, the sheer dilly-dallying that is facilitated in this ludum is thus charming that one such as I, one who could be described as paresseux comme baise, would scribe a true pinnacle of summitous apexity in the latitudes of criticisms. And thus, at the decisive terminal of this criticism I would implore you, my venerable gentleman or gentlewoman, to amuse yourself with this ludum of exceptional excellence. Now, my treasured asinine, experience the wonder that is Collective Fortification II with your personal senses by embarking on the quest that is this ludum! Godspeed and have a good evening by now. Best regards, MLAnonymous			"

 The meet your match update.      I met my match alright, because I can't stand this horrible update.          I've been a long time player, been here since the Replay Update back in may of 2011, and this is my absolute favorite game of all time, but this update might finally be the nail in the coffin for me.      The biggest glaring issue here is the removal of valve servers. Say you want to play a match of sawmill or maybe a map that isn't so popular such as lumberyard, you would normally just bring up the browser, narrow the search to the map you want, find the valve server with a healthy amount of players and good ping, boom! You're done!  Nope, with the newest EPIC CONTENT UPDATE, these servers have since been removed, and replaced with 'casual mode'    Casual mode      Now casual mode is its own can of worms. During the launch of this update, you couldn't even CHOOSE THE MAP YOU WANTED TO PLAY ON. You picked your game mode, pressed a button, and now you're shoved in a que for an extrememly long waiting time. Some things have been fixed since then, though the experience is hardly any better. It goes something like this:1. Choose the map and mode you wish to play2. Enter the que and wait up to 5 minutes to get into a game3. Join a server that is often a one sided stomp that ends faster than the time it took to join the server4. The map ends, everyone disconnects5. Repeat steps 1-4 until you die of old age     You might be thinking ""just go play on community servers!"" If by ""community servers"" you mean ""only 2fort/dustbowl"" then sure, you can play that to your hearts content. But for a game with 92 different maps spanning across 15 game modes, I think I'm right in wanting a little bit of diversity here and there.      There are other servers of course, many in fact, so why don't I play on some of them? Mainly because, most of them are garbage custom servers or AMAZING trade servers. I hope you like custom maps/modes (especially minecraft ones), because there are about 9 billion of them to choose from!      I live on the east coast of America and mainly play at night. I can hardly ever find a match with 20 players+, good ping, and stock maps that aren't dustbowl/2fort. This is unnacceptable. Where the hell are all the 50k players at?   Competitive Mode      I don't play competitive, and frankly never ever will. Personally I believe this game isn't competitive and should have never had had this mode added. This is the main point of this update, so it must be amazing right?      Wrong.      As far as I know, this mode has been in beta for half a year, maybe less/more. Plenty of time to polish some of its features up. But yet again, Valve somehow managed to screw it up.      No class restrictions, telephone number REQUIRED or else you have to spend money, no weapon restrictions, no real rewards.      No class restricitions is self explanatory. You can have about 6 engineers/snipers/spies on your team if you wanted. Now this isn't always a bad thing per se, but If you plan on playing competitive solo, half a team full of gibus spies might be an issue.      The telephone number restriction helps combat against trolls and griefers, but then again, what about the people that don't have a telephone number or don't want to give away their personal contact information to Valve?      Cough up that $10 buddy because that's the toll of admission if you want to join the competitive club.      Now to me, the no weapon restrictions would honestly kill the mode for me. Banning some of the more broken weapons would really level the playing field. Instead, you get full access to the mini-crits-on-demand cola and the reserve 130-damage-for-blowbacking-a-target-shooter (which by the way, valve planned on buffing for this update).      Last but not least, no real rewards. Valve should be aware that the vast majority of the playerbase isn't going to play competitive just to win and rank up that badge that no one outside of competitive mode will see. They could have added some fancy new weapon skins or exclusive cosmetics to compensate that gut wrenching grind to level 10 or even level 18. But instead, you get nothing. You upgrade your badge to a different picture and that's your lot.    In conclusion       tldr this update sucks and I advise everyone to stay away from the game until they update casual to feel more like valve servers again       This is my first long review that isn't just a meme sentence, and this game has a special place in my heart, so it deserves something that comes from it.

												Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is one the games that you really have to try, it is Free to Play (F2P) and has an outstanding unique first-person shooter (FPS) style. Unlike most FPS that is played competitively, it focuses more on fun and especially humor. TF2 has a various types of character classes and game modes, a bunch of maps and hats (yes you read it right, HATS!).GameplayTF2 is fun yet a challenging game, it has a rich gameplay and a huge community. It is composed of two opposing factions represented by the name of these companies, the Reliable Excavation & Demolition (RED) and Builders League United (BLU) which are mercenaries hired by two opposing brothers. Players can choose any classes, characters and the side they represent to compete against the opposing team through certain missions/objectives per game mode. Gamemodes:Unlike most FPS games, TF2 has a lot of good game modes, every game mode has a different and unique play style which makes the game interesting. Other game modes are still in beta stage thus small bugs might occur but overall  it has a decent maps, objectives and team play. Here's a list of game modes and its respective mission/objective:Capture the Flag - Each team has their own intelligence briefcases that they have to protect from the opposing team, the main objective is to capture enemy's intelligence until they reach the game's capture limit.Control Point - Game mode based on control points where you capture enemy points and protect each point from being captured.Territorial Control - Game mode based on ""point to point"" where you must capture the enemy point and defend yours, points gets randomly selected in a different place to protect or to capture.Payload - A series of checkpoints where you have to get the cart to the final point while the enemies tries to stop you.Arena - A tactical mode whereas teams fight under pressure in a smaller maps for shorter matches. A control point is found at the center of the map, where you have to capture without being killed.King of the Hill - like the ""Arena"", it focuses on a single control point where you have to capture till 3 minutes or defend the point before the enemy takes full control of the point. Payload Race - Each team will be given a cart for teams to push and compete and defend the point against the other team.Medieval Mode - There will be a number of points like the ""Control Point"" but both teams can only choose from a set list of allowed weapons.Special Delivery - A unique game mode where both teams must capture a neutral briefcase, the team who takes it first must bring it to a specified area of the map while the opposing team must stop them defending the area. Once the briefcase drops, enemy team can't take it but rather defend the briefcase from being taken.Mann vs. Machine - Another unique game mode where a team of three or six player must defend the Mann Co's strongholds from a wave of raging robots that carries a bomb. Robot Destruction - A beta map where teams must destroy the opposing team's robots and collect the Power Cores to earn points. After gaining points, a Reactor Core appears that can be stolen by the opposing team.Mannpower - Teams must capture the enemy's intelligence briefcase while adding a twist in game with grappling hooks and 12 unique power-ups.PASS Time - Another beta map that has a football like game play. Team must take hold of the jack to throw it to the opposing team's goal.Player Destruction - A game mode created by the community where players must collect bottles of beer from killed enemies and jumping to the UFO after. Once a player gets killed they will drop their held beers that can be taken by both teams.The best map for beginners would be King of the Hill, its simple yet fun. Classes and Characters:Most FPS games focuses more on weapons and less on characters, in TF2 you can get to choose 9 different characters with unique roles and special abilities. The game is created to have fun thus expect a unique approach on certain abilities. Here's a list of classes and characters with their respective roles and characteristics:Offense (good for veterans)Scout - A fast and agile character that can capture and pushes cart faster than any characters, has a special ability that can jump twice in mid air. Equipped with scatter gun, pistol and a baseball bat.Soldier - Slower but durable character that uses a rocket launcher, shotgun and a shovel. He can use his rocket launcher to launch himself into the air (not into the outer space) with the cost of his health for a better aiming with style (seems ironic).Pyro - A pyromaniac that uses flamethrower, fire axe and a shotgun, they can blast it to an ally to extinguish fire or use it to an enemy to gain distance.Defense (good for advanced players)Demoman - A character that uses explosives to defend an area. Equipped with granade, sticky bomb and a bottle.Heavy - Slow but can sustain and deal a huge amount of damage. Equipped with an enormous mini-gun, a shotgun and its own fist to strike.Engineer - A character that can build and destroy machines capable of defending with sentry gun, a teleport machine and a health and ammo dispenser. Equipped with a Shotgun, a pistol and a wrench. Support (good for beginners) Medic - A doctor that his main role is to heal his allies, healing allies can grant ÜberCharge that can boost him and his healed ally. Equipped with Medi gun, syringe and a bonesaw.Sniper - A sniper that can kill enemies with one shot from afar. Equips with a sniper rifle (what would you expect, a laser beam?), a submachine gun and a kukri (a starter pack good for campers).Spy - A character that sneaks into the enemy's back and strikes with a knife, has a special ability that can turn himself invisible to the enemies eyes and can destroy machines easily. Equipped with a pistol, a watch that can make himself invisible, an elctronic sapper that can take down machines easily, a device hidden in a cigarette case that cloak himself into an enemy character, a revolver and a butterfly knife or balisong (originated from the Philippines) that can kill with one stab if used properly. (absolutely not for newbies) Classes, Characters and team can be changed while the game is in progress. This can be done by pressing "", (comma)"" to change class and character and by pressing "". (period)"" to change team.ControlsJust like most FPS games, TF2 uses the standard keyboard set-up which is the basic WASD (forward, move left, backward and move right) movement, R to reload, Q for last weapon used and etc. Mouse is used to aim (point), shoot (left-click), use every character's special skill (right-click) and to change weapon (mouse wheel up or down). The controls are smooth and comfortable, weapons can be changed through the keyboard with keys: 1, 2 and 3/4, 5 and 6 or through the mouse button by scrolling up or down. ProsArtistic Character DesignFree and easy to playUp to 3 different classes and 9 different characters to choose fromHumorous and fun without pressureGood reward systemConsNew players might find this game challengingYou might get bored after some timeConclusionThe game is good to have fun and to kill some time but with more FPS games coming around its hard to keep up. I recommend this game for non competitive ones and for those who just want to play a good F2P FPS game, it has smooth and comfortable controls with decent character model and animation. Overall, this game is unique and better than any other FPS games, it has a strong game play and outstanding maps but if you are into a more competitive side, this game is simply not for you but absolutely worth the try.

												Ah, tf2. Best game I've ever seen in my life. When I started playing tf2, I only played it for the gameplay. It was (and still is) real fun to play. But after some months, I discovered trading. The wonderful trading. After months of trading, I learned a lot about it. And now, I do it almost every day! It will always be my hobby. c: It's even a great way to earn money! :D I have to say, there aren't that much weapons. There are more cosmetics then weapons. I'm not really a fan of cosmetics, I prefer have weapons (that's why I almost have them all, except 5). And when there comes new items during an update, then that are only cosmetics/reskins of weapons/weapons in an other quality. For now the qualities that are coming more of: Strange and Collector's. Collector's is a new, and pretty expensive quality, but not really diffirent then the 'unique' quality. And Strange is a quality that counts kills/points/etc that you made with the weapon/misc that's in this quality. I'm a truly fan of Strange weapons, and I own 41 out of 120 (this is except Australiums, Botkillers and Festives, because that are 'just' reskins) Someday I'll buy the rest of them too :DAlright, I told pretty much I guess, and I hope this review was useful for you. Thanks for reading and enjoy playing tf2!- Wario_16, 2014.			"

												The Second Fortress of Team is a roleplaying rpg. If you can see around this game's high price, I'm sure you'll be able to enjoy the stunning, photorealistic and colourful graphics this game gives. Based heavily on realism, Second Team Fortress is a very tough game to learn with all of the realistic gun mechanics. It improves on its strick mechanics by allowing the player get killstreaks after a certain number of kills.I give Call of Fortress 2 a Treyarch of an Activision.			"

												Basic steps to be a professional tf2 player:-Install it.-Join a payload server.-Dominate a gibus sniper.-Equip your brand new, extremely, incredible, mega-plasma-hyper 5000 hat.-Speak english in voicechat with an awful swedish accent.-Beg for cosmetics.-Do your best! Why dance conga with that unusual-soldier when you can kill him and get a whole point for it!?   When you played the game for a while and almost mastered it, you're ready for the next step:  Paint all your cosmetics that you got from begging with ""A bitter taste of defeat and lime"" or ""Pink as Hell"".   Hope this helps you on your great journey in Teufort!!!			"

												TF2 used to be a Overall amazing game. Great Community, Servers, Gamemodes, and just a Great Game.Now, TF2's New update: Meet your Match, has made TF2 completly awful. I have many reasons on why this update made people dislike TF2 now.Reason 1: The menuThe new Menu for TF2 is just the start of it. Everything has been moved around into ""Find Game"". Which i can't even find anything now.Reason 2: CasualCasual, The main Reason TF2 is going down. You have to wait like 30 minuets to find a game. But when you get into a match, its even more bad, everyone is a Tryhard, you cant even play your favorite gamemode/map anymore. You can't find the map you want to play anymore. and if you Leave the game you are in, You get a Penalty, Really?Reason 3: Balance ChangesTo be really honest, These changes were not Really Necessary. Eventhough the New ShortStop Alt-Fire is pretty cool, along with the +20 speed boost for Spy is cool, it was not Needed.Reason 4: The ModlesWhile i was playing Casual (Which i did not enjoy), The Spy Modle was Really Broken, same with the Items.Reason 5: ReskinsThese reskins were Not Necessary either, eventhough they look funny, you cant see anything cause of the Sign on the side of the Jumpers.Overall:Valve has made amazing Updates in their past, But this Update was awful. They could have done the Iron Gauntlet or the MayMann Update, but i guess Valve said ♥♥♥♥ you To the Community. If you want to play TF2 now, you're gonna have to accept this very Awful Update. "

												In this game helping your team (collect hats) is vital to ensure victory in the (tryhard) battle field full of (F2Ps) death and dispair (hats).With all 9 classes (9001 hats) to choose from, the gameplay (hat choice) will most definitely be different from the first time you  played (wore a Gibus) as your skill (backpack value) goes up in the ranks of battle (unusuals) in this Free to Play (Free2Troll) funfest (Gabefest).I give it a dan outa dan.

												Best game I have ever played, I hope it keeps it own spirit high, because we alle know it is slowly killing itself if they don't straiten there backs with better content for this geme of a game. I wish it was like as popular as in 2014-2016. Those where the golden age for me with this game.If anyone of you (or your friends) think about playing this game or starting playing, then do it, please and this is in my opinion the best community. Yes, there are alot of trolls and ""pranksters"", but if you ever see some of my friends in a game with you. Then you have the best people in your game. Many of my friends I found trough TF2, and I sadly never talk to them. I hope to change that, but never the less. This game is awsome (but the competative suck and don't play it) and in my eyes this is the best game that i have ever disscoverd on Steam, and nothing can compare with this game.			"

												Ah TF2... ""You were good son real good, maybe even the best."" This was my thoughts exactly before Meet Your Match Update became live. I have pumped so, so many hours into this game and as of late, I've been turned off from TF2 and I really am worried with the way things are right now and seem to be headed. I was honestly looking forward to this update when I first heard about it, and when it came out I immedietely tried out the new casual mode and when I finally got into a server after waiting about 30 minutes (because quickplay got removed) I was greeted with a 6v12 round and got my ♥♥♥ handed to me and had to disconnect after finishing. Since then casual mode has improved, yes, but it could have simply been an added on instead of replacing pubs because in all honesty as I see it, casual is simply competitive easy mode where as pubs were all about having fun with very little consequences where it didn't really matter if you won or lost. I really don't understand why Valve decided to get rid of pubs. Who knows, maybe it was an idea made by the developers that decided that Phlog pyros should become godly before renerfing it to what it is now.			"

												Valve are doing anything but what we need and when we need. At the beginning of a quite good class-based shooter, instead of fixing some bugs and making a normal netcode, they turned the game into a hat-selling simulator and were sitting on their ♥♥♥ even for years, getting money for every community item players have created themselves. And now, when alternative games appeared and they began to lose audience, Valve suddenly realised they have to do something what should been done in 2010 - welcome to competetive scene and matchmaking! Only the implementation of all of this is very 'special'. For example, using matchmaking system, players from the United States sometimes are joining on the European servers (with ping ~150). Europeans are in the same boat, because there are perfect Dubai servers where they can play with the same ping.There still is no classlimit in competetive mode (and I'm not even talking about whitelists), but they already removed some 'unnecessary' settings there - like ability to change player's FOV (are you ♥♥♥♥♥ serious? what moron came up with fixed ~75  fov?); broken configs and the inability to hide weapon models are enjoyable too. Maps are picked randomly, while map pool is extremely doubtful (pl_swiftwater in 6v6? really?). What kind of competetive is this?It would be much better if they finally fixed some physics problems which are pulled out since GldSource games (like terrible wall collisions) and making a normal lag compensation netcode.

Fantastic Friends-Maker, Random (Fri)enemy-Generator, Great Hat Simulator... ...comes with awesome, action packed, nonsensical comics & short films, fluctuating content & trade market, and community creationsBut of course, who can forget the wonderful mini games that involve in bullets, explosives, advanced medical beams, sharp objects, and air compression? For the reasons above, this game is my first committed pew pew game. TL;DR : It can be cute and fun________________________________TF2 is a cute, comical game that has won me over: I have wasted my youth on it. I love how a pew-pew game can spark creativity in terms of weapon loadouts to cosmetics. Even some of the community made maps and objectives over the years, have been adorable. I am purposely refraining from gameplay review/TF2 politics because: Each update causes a major community uproar, as we are slow to adapt to changes. It's like a cool grandpa: You know his most glorious days were in the past, so you can't really expect him to function the same as before. Yet he's still pretty awesome for his age. There's always going to be something to say about balances The game has been out for long enough for all kinds of analysis to be done.I will leave all the commenting to past reviewers and experts.Some of my overall positve experienceVery easy to learn and navigate, easy to customize, generally chill environment with exceptionsEasy to config and Runs on a craptopElements of creativity is encouraged: from loadouts to maps and cosmetics. Sometimes even the team composition and gameplay can be transformed.You can take it as serious as you want: There are various avenues availableCute pew pew game for all ages: I've seen parents and their kids playing thisLittle turds aside (which you can encounter often bobbing around online), people can be pretty nice.Conclusion:Take our monies... wait what monies? Try out the game, there is nothing to lose... wait cept for dealing with aimbotters.			"

												The fall of TF2.For me personaly started it around 25 Feb 2014, with the inplementation of ""Quickplay"" or what other like to call it ""The Death of Community Servers"". I mean don't get me wrong the valve server were great back there. But it was a shame to see all the good Community Servers die, servers where i played like 24/7. But it wasn't the end of the world for me.Now i just played on valve server only, it wasnt the best, but it was still fun. But then at 16 Oct 2014 something chaged. Valve servers are now using sv_pure 1. ""The death of mods"". That was a huge part of my in my gaming experience. I love to mod my games. And now *poof* gone.I started to play other games like PayDay2 or DirtyBomb etc. But I always came back for a good old  round TF2Then the 09 Dez 2014 ""END OF THE LINE"" update hit [""TFGO""] And i hated it. I do not dislike the idea of skins, but i mean we allready got hats for days. Enough is Enough... And don't get me started with this ♥♥♥♥ing ducks. And the ever increasing performance hits made it not better. [I wana play my games over 60 fps ffs]Around middle of last year i stoped playing tf2, sold all my hats and strages. Played other games and just waited that overwatch would came out.Now we have the 8 Jul 2016 and i was looking forward to this update. I thought wow some fresh air but god...i was wrong they chaged the qickplay to noplay, everything is now comp.WERE IS THE CASUAL VIBE....WERE IS ...T F 2... I LOVED THIS GAMEBut the game i loved is a distance memory...I just wanted to have tf2 back.			"

												I Cant. Tf2 team doesnt even play the game they work on, sorry, but its true, legit the last few updates where just a let down:Meet your match Tough Break InvasionGun Mettle End of the line I love this game and i have defended everyone of these updates like the fanboy i am but its time to stop.This update (meet your match) made a huge rip into the tf2 community, on one side you have people beeing mad at valve for ♥♥♥♥ing up, the other half is defending them and saying how great this update is if you look close enough. This update pushes away new players. This update, for little to no reason, replaced pubs and instead implemented a broken casual matchmaking system that in 25 games i didnt have one balanced round. This Update ""rebalances weapons"" to the point that they are just unusable. And most of all it showed how little the tf2 team cares about their community and the game. For example how they never communicate with the community until its far to late, how they change weapon stats like the bison claiming that the penetration aspect was a bug (even though it was a tip on the loading screen for 8 ♥♥♥♥ING GOD  DAMN YEARS). How in previos updates they would after months of people complaining over certain weps BUFF them, like the loch n load and the phlog. The biggest mistake is not that the update is ♥♥♥♥ but rather that there was an update like this. Valve rarely talks to the community and one day, if not already, this will bite them in the ♥♥♥.

												Before you read this and start downvoting it cause its ""TF2"" please actually read my review. I have over 5,500 hours in the game and have a lot of Competitive experience into TF2 being 1st Place Steel S.18 and moving to High Silver now. Feel free to add me if you have any questions!Now on with the review... there is a TL;DR in the bottom.Team Fortress 2 Pubs reminds me of Mario Party, you can have SOME skill into it but in the end its just RNG and what other people are doing that really lessens the skill factor.Team Fortress 2 is absolutely no doubt the most addicting first person shooter I have ever played hands down!The game has variety of full teamwork ability and strongly encouraged.I played Team Fortress 2 back in the end of 2010 and to the beginning of 2011. I even played TF2 on my Xbox at 2009 and on Xbox I was ranked 60 worldwide for a while. TF2 now a days... is just not the same as it is. The MAJOR problem in Team Fortress 2 is Pubs. The games main focus is pubs for new players and pubs are just... awful. If you're new however you wont notice this as much. Its basically a Deathmatch of all classes and the worst part is there really isnt any variety in classes. Everyone in TF2 mains either Scout, Soldier, or Sniper (mostly sniper).The TF2 Gameplay Mechanics are good for what their class does but new weapons introduced made the game just... less enjoyable. Lets put into the example of the Phlog. The Phlog was always hated by practically the whole community and Valve knew it. Instead? They BUFF it instead of NERF it. They finally (nerfed) it so its actually ""kinda"" fair now but its things like this where I wonder if the TF2 team actually has any idea what they're doing. Valve also for whatever reason loves random crits in Team Fortress 2. They used to have an option to where you could vote on the server to turn off Random crits but they instead realised ""Hey... that's dumb, people aren't supposed to have fun in this game lol."" Then added back Random Crits to stay and you cant vote it off. I honestly think Valve takes Team Fortress 2 as a game of Mario Party.The TF2 Community IS DOWNRIGHT NO OTHER WAY TO PUT IT TOXIC!!! At times i'd say it can possibly be even worse then the COD community. I ATLEAST had a few laughs with people in the COD community (not saying its a good community its just an example) If anyone tries talking in the mic its usually ""Shut up ♥♥♥♥♥♥"" The community is also really stupid... fights will break out everywhere for the dumbest reasons and most people have no idea how to actually play the game and if you try giving them any tips whatsoever the topic of choice usually ends in a arguement of how ""you're bad"". Chatting in TF2 is nonexistent because chats are usually filled with overused le lennys and stupid binds that are honestly awful and not funny and to the point where people will only use one bind the whole game and actually focus on using binds more then actually playing the game. The Fanbases... Christ the Fanbases... are just everywhere... I really dont have a problem with them but the thing is that they're the kind that like to jam it down your throat.The TF2 Market is so boring now. Unusuals back in around 2010-2013 were pretty rare to come by and when people saw you with an unusual they thought ""Wow how cool, this guy is original"" thing about Unusuals NOW is that everyone practically has one, being a game second focused on design this gets pretty boring and old to say the least considering that unusuals were made for the purpose of being ""original"" and were fun to look at back then. Escrow also made the TF2 Market 100% WORSE. TF2 Trade servers are mostly dead with just a couple that still live with a full server of people who actually go there, really due to escrow (you ♥♥♥♥ed up on that one Valve)The TF2 Updates used to be so cool and fun. Valve however decided that it would be cool for the community to make some. Which was honestly, a good idea. Too bad they thought that EVERY MAJOR UPDATE should be community based. Yeah great... Its not even the Communitys fault for the updates they make but it lacks DEVELOPMENT of what a real MAJOR update could be, you know... the COMPANYS JOB!!? Now all new updates consist of NEW SKINS AND CONTRACTS. WE DONT EVEN GET NEW HATS BARELY ANYMORE OF WHAT THIS GAME IS FOCUSED ON. The worst part is that Valve doesnt even know what to do in the game anymore. A good example of this is that Valve nerfs Engineer when Engineer is pretty balanced... Just when people found tactics on how to effectivly play Engineer, their response is to nerf Engineer to the core and make sure he cannot do anything to protect anything. This game is supposed to have variety with all classes and they completely spit on certain classes like Engie. Also weapons like The Beggars Bazooka for Soldier should really only be available in gamemodes like Mann Vs Machine. Some weapons in TF2 are just flat out broken and I still question ""Who the Hell even THOUGHT of this"".The TF2 Competitive Scene is by far the ONLY GOOD SUBJECT OF THIS GAME! Good luck starting in a TF2 pub. You will not get any practice of any actual competitive interest except aiming and shooting. The Competitve Community for TF2 is... better? It's still pretty toxic. Competitive games for TF2 are fun if you're playing for real. There are two gamemodes that are focused in competitive being Highlander and 6s. Highlander consists of being more teamwork based. Its one of each class fighting another team that consist of one of each class, HL's desired maps are usually Payload and King of the Hill but can consist of Control Points as well. 6s is more Deathmatch based but still desires teamwork. 2 Scouts (Utilities), 2 Soldiers (1 Pocket, 1 Roamer), Demoman, and Medic are the prime classes on each. Different classes are allowed however usually the Scouts switch IF NEEDED (For example if one of the Scouts is good at Sniper they can quickly switch to Sniper and play Sniper for the time being until they want to switch out to another class or stay Scout) The reason why the Scouts are called Utilities is because they are probably the best set in 6's but can be switched as they aren't as important as having Soldiers or the Demo or Medic.The TF2 Matchmaking I mean... its in beta so I cant trash talk it to much but saying FOR NOW atleast its pretty bad. Most people off class and use stupid gimmicks (Two scouts on a team running crit a cola... really...) and if you're rolling the enemy team they're most likely going to rage quit and leave so you dont get any experience. Also experience doesnt matter if you singlely carried the team by frags (kills), assists, healing, exc. It only matters on if you win or lose which really honostly stupid.PROS:-Addicting Gameplay!-Amazing Competitive!-Wonderful Multi Mod Gamemodes (VSH/FF2, Deathrun, ect.)-Addicting Seperate Gamemode, Mann Vs Machine!-Thousands of different sets to have on every class!-Classes are pretty easy to learnCONS:-Horrible Community-Most Major Updates are focused on being Community built, Valve avoids doing anything themselves.-Pubs are most of the time stacked and not worth playing other then for DM-Few weapons I can count with my fingers that completely ruin the game's entertainment-Class mains used to have variety. It's now mostly focused only on Scout, Soldier, and Sniper (again, mostly Sniper)-Company takes no interest in TF2 anymore. If anything, almost looks like its waiting for it to just die...TL;DR: The Game depends on how you play, if you want to have a good time and you have some friends try out the game. Its not to late to get into competitive but most of the good players are gone and moved to CS:GO.-bonkoEdit April 24: Changing some of the things in the review that seem more fit for the time now			"

												This review is very lengthy, as I have a lot to say about this game. So sit tight, you are in for a long ride.Let's get the verdict out of the way before we get to the real talk: Yes, I recommend this game.  I have spent hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars on it. Is it worth playing? Yes. Is it worth investing your time for a deeper experience? Probably not. I already predict a lot of hate for this review, but I need to get it off my chest and explain the issues I have with this game. Once again those are my own opinions that a lot of people happen to share. It is completely fine if you want to argue against it, I will just ask you to be honest and less defensive because TF2 is in a critical state. First of all, I'd like to point out that I've spent 1780 hours, which might be low for some, high for others. I started playing in late 2009-early 2010 and in intervals of several months between late 2010 and early 2012. I enjoyed this game a lot since it was a fresh change from the FPS games I used to play back in the days (CoD 2/4 or CS). It was extremely fun, and trust me, I do not regret a single minute I've spent on this game, before early 2014 at least. I'm not really the Shakespeare of game reviews, and English doesn't happen to be my first language, but I'll do my best to explain my points clearly. I'm going to spend some time explaining each major part the games.I - Competitive:Why do I want to list this subject first? Simply because this will be a quick talk: Competitive TF2 is basically the best place where you can fully enjoy TF2. The competitive community is mostly made of good and helpful people. You will play the game the way it should've been played, whether it's a lobby, pug or a UGC match. For my part, I didn't really want to get into UGC because unfortunately I was already getting into CS:GO and couldn't get the time to look for a team but there is no reason you shouldn't.II - Trading:We had the good part, now the okayish part. Barely spent anytime there. I never got interested in it mainly because I'm not patient, and I can get the thing I need directly without spending 3 years working for a bigger backpack. Most of TF2 is usually into trading, whether they spend 1 hour a month or 23 hours a day in a trading website/server. The trading community is really mixed. It has good people in it, but it also has scammers and idiots. Yet, this is where I've got to meet a lot of good friends, and where I've been amazed by the ego of some. At the current state of the game, according to many professional traders, unless you have some insane item, you won't make any profit. With all the useless hats added, the supply of cosmetics is insanely high, the demand is scattered and the value the currency holds keeps dropping, dragging everything down with it. In short, trade if you want, but watch out for scammers and sharks and stick with the good people. There aren't many, but they are out there. Trading would've been one of the strengths of TF2 if Valve and the heads of some communities didn't ruin it.III - Community:It's really mixed. You can find good people if you go to the right pubs, as well as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who will instantly kick you if you aren't a ""friendly heavy"" or if you ruin their conga or any kind of circlejerk those guys are into. I wasn't lucky with Valve servers as well. Most of the times I played in those servers I was left with autistic meme spouters, 300 ping brazilians or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who will call you a tryhard if you simply try to play the game as intended. Some people also blame bronies or furries for making it worse. I honestly don't care about both, I had to witness a lot of pubs with regulars I've enjoyed playing with dying, and if there is something to blame it is not one of the game's communities such as the ones cited above, but rather the direction the game is currently taking.IV - Updates:The game is making a terrible turn. It went from a game that could've been a success in eSports to a casual cash-grabber made to attract more people into Steam. They keep on adding useless lore-breaking cosmetics aswell as useless weapons that keep on making the game worse. Many want Valve to add more weapons to the game - I don't. You have to understand that the point of unlocks are, or were to be very situational items and could also act as a costly alternative such as the Gunboats. Some weapons now are either completely useless such as the new grenade launcher or the Back Scatter or completely random such as the Base Jumper or the Tide Turner. Many people are complaining about EoTL for being one of the worst updates possible to the game. It was overhyped by you guys because you couldn't understand that this was the way Valve wants the game to be. Don't blame those who made EoTL, the ones to blame are those in charge of TF2. They had then to throw in a broken ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game mode that seemed to be coded within a day, as well as a couple of useless weapons or taunts to calm the community down after the disaster. The sad part is that it worked. Meanwhile, almost everyone is still waiting on that ""confirmed"" matchmaking system which also got ""confirmed"" back in 2013. Everyone's hyping it, so please, for the sake of the people who still have faith this game, whoever now's in charge of this game, do NOT ♥♥♥♥ it up.The game is now 8 years old and still a success for the wrong reasons; but how long is it going to last before more and more people get tired by the way Valve handles the game? Once again, most of these are based on my opinions as well as the opinions of others. I hope this  might be useful for some. I had to write it to unleash the anger I had against the incompetent team supposed to replace the original developers. So go ahead, enjoy the game, play it as its fullest. If you've never played this game you are missing something, so do it now while it lasts. Thank you for your time.			"

tf2 is not dead (yet)Edit:So I said that MyM wasn't that bad after all, but only with all the fixes that came afterwards.When MyM just shipped it was horrible and mm and casual were unplayabale.But the system works very well now and I start to prefer it over the old one.Tf2 is a really old game and it shouldn't have this many bugs in it, but valve just flooded the game with cosmetics and doesn't put much effort into anything else. I'm not saying the game is bad, they recently fixed a lot of bugs and when you play casual games it's still full of f2ps (which is a good sign). But right now the playerbase is decreasing. It's really sad considering how much effort this amazing community has put into this game (probably still more than the current dev team lmao). Tf2 is an old game, but that doesn't mean it has to die. This game could really shine again if valve would get their ♥♥♥♥ together.tl;dr game is playable right now and fun imo but devs are lazy			"

												I had to change this review, because times have changed. A lot. This doesn't mean the game is awful and should be kept away from. The core gameplay has stayed the same and great, but there are other reasons why I wouldn't recommend getting into it big-time.First of all, no - I do not dislike this game.This game is supposed to earn its longevity through updates, yet these are becoming more and more rare, and getting an actually good update is like getting a full mark on an exam. What used to happen was: Valve released updates regularly. These updates contained new weapons, maps, balance changes and game modes - exactly what the game needed. But now, every new update is a cash-grab where you pay 5 Euros to have a woman tell you to play the game and for playing the game for about 20 minutes you get either a lame skin to a weapon, or a crate you have to pay extra 2 Euros to open and get another skin.This practice is somewhat new, yet people have been complaining about the updates for a long time. Let's take a look at the 3 most recent actually BIG updates, containing stuff which made the game a bit different and new:The Gun Mettle update 2/07/2015The Love & War update 18/06/2014The Two Cities update 21/11/2013The Gun Mettle update was probably the most controversial of all. It introduced the contracts and weapon skins along with major balance changes.The Love & War update included some new weapons, taunts and reskins - all-round a good update.The Two Cities update added a new tour and maps to MvM, along with the killstreak mechanics.""But I don't even care about the updates!"" I hear you cry. The problem is that playing the game is becoming more and more difficult. The optimisation gets worse with every update, the community is becoming increasingly toxic, servers are like the ying-yang and players are either complete noobs who have no idea how the game works, or pubstompers who destroy everyone on a public server.Again - the game is good, but there are a lot of issues that prevent me from having fun with it. And the worst thing is that I don't think anything can be done by Valve to solve it. It's fine to jump in and play casually once in a while, but becoming a Team Fortress 2 player will be difficult and not fun.			"

												in its current state, i simply cannot reccomend this game. current pros:+giant community+for the most part it IS fun+the devs listen to the community+the community can have thier weapons, maps, whatever they make put into the game if valve thinks that it is worth it. (the creators get a share of any profit made)+not your generic 'respawn simulator'. you can get shot in the face by a rocket and still live. current cons:-matchmaking is the worst its ever been:no more auto balancing means if your team gets steamrolled, it'll be a 3-6 vs 12 or vice versa if your doing the rick rolling.-the casual levels dont really mean anything, as im nearly in tier 2 (blue medals) and im fighting against level 1's. -only JUST added the kick function-we still see hackers and people spamming 'LMAO BOX' in the chat after all these years. -some of valves new looks for the weapons are childish and makes the game more silly than anything (looking at you, rocket jumper and sticky jumper)-current bug in the game where if you leave a match, it auto-puts you on the find a match screen. double-clicking the cancel search button results in the game assigning you a match that you cannot enter.-community-run servers are barebones now! there used to be so many community maps like degroot keep and X10 mode. now all we got are some X10 modes and trade servers. awesome -_-now, as we all know, a youtuber and spy main ambassador known as 'mr.paladin' has left tf2. like, put the game to rest. he has played an AMAZING 6,715 hours on tf2 alone. almost a year of his life on team fortress 2. people are blaming overwatch for this, but i dont see it that way. as he said, the last update was the 'last straw' and 'couldnt re-kindle my interest'. if someone who has had the dedication to play tf2 for so long cannot find the new spark, then how are new players going to put up with the matchmaking, the hackers (every once in a while, valve has done a pretty good job to get rid of as many as possible) etc. right now? myself? im gonna keep playing. hopefully there will be other updates to return tf2 to what the people want and love. the thoughts of 'its being broken down and re-built' i can get: tf2 wants to still be on the competitve market, to attract new players and keep the games heart beating for years to come. but with this update, i cannot see how this can happen. (the next point im going to make was ramblings i had while waiting for a friend earlier today, so if it doesnt make sense try to get as much as you can)lets look at some of the big changes in the meet your match update regarding weapons!first up is: the soda popper, the scouts favourite escape tool. just run around and if you get into trouble, just activate the hype and jump away! right? no? oh, now when you take damage you build hype. ok, but if you die, you lose your hype. but in order to build hype, you need to take damage? well, better not equip anything that makes me weaker in any way then. next up is the sydney sleeper, my favourite weapon as a sniper. now, you can be even more of a ♥♥♥♥ with it as it applies jarate in a radius like the wrap assassins ball and can extinguish teammates with it. yay! 3rd up:huo long heater. this weapon is supposed to be anti-spy but it never works. add a -10% damage and ring of fire damage reduced to 12, unless you have a pyro on your team your boned.enforcer for the spy! finally, this gun as an awesome use, not just as a last means of escape. now does true damage, ignoring things like battalions backup and vaccinator. medics now all-medigun movement speed buff. its kinda meh, as it makes the quick fix slightly less usefull but makes the others a little more viable. double for demo: boots now need a shield to activate speed bonus (before it was an alright trade off, missing a weapon in trade for more HP and movement speed) and the new quickiebomb launcher. this weapon was meant to be for people who dont lay sticky straps and use it as a main weapon. now, you have less in the clip but faster load up time, faster fuse time, more damage on max load and no longer dissapears after 4 seconds. more like spammybomb launcher am i right? guy? no? ok.engie! with the GIANT decrease in tele cost (from 125 metal down to just 50) its easier to set up, and widowmakers bonus damage to same-target as turret is awesome,but.. well.. it doesnt feel like it needed it. the widowmakers strong AF before if you can a good meatshot, but now it feels like overkill.this update has had highs and lows, almost as if valve didnt know what they were doing. we have only JUST got the option to choose maps back-before it was a gamble. we all thought that tf2 was gonna pull a MVM on us and just add it as a new gamemode- if we knew what was gonna happen back then, we could have, no would have spoke up and helped the valve community make any difficult decisions. really, this review is a plead to valve, to contact the community and let us have our say about what should come back! auto balancing, revised matchmaking, discussions with the community about future updates! the heavy VS pyro poll was a genius way to see what we wanted, so please more such as this to see what the community wants and needs! anyone who has read this, i thank you for your time. im not hanging up my hats just yet, but... who knows. maybe this old dog just cant keep up with the young pups today.

												I feel as if I should re-write me review for this game, as when I did several years ago I was young and it never really achieved much.Now as someone who has spent almost 3000 hours of playing this game, I can easily recommend it to anyone who is fresh to steam, or first person games in general. This game provides a helpful tutorial to anyone who isn't ignorant (which I assume the readers are not as they are reading this review, doing research and are eager to learn), teaching basic concepts and how to play more of the unique classes such as the spy and engineer. There is even a training mode to play against AI if you feel that playing against real people is too challenging to begin with. Team Fortress 2 is definitely a game you should get if you are new to steam or PC gaming in general.TF2 is very different, very diverse compared to other FPS titles. You play as one of nine classes, all with varying roles and weaponry, all with their own strengths and weaknesses. With easily over 100 different weapons in the game, there are many different things to try out. This list keeps growing with the variety of maps and gamemodes to choose from, such as Capture the Flag (a staple in many FPS games), Payload, Mann vs Machine and PASS time. The game also gets somewhat frequent updates, both community made and official, always adding new content and therefore more fun, all without paying a cent.Microtransactions exist in this game, however not in a pay-to-win function. They solely exist as a cosmetic function, allowing players to add hats, beards, almost any sort of visual appearance to the mercenaries they play as. Now, as this is only decorational, free-to-play players (or F2Ps for short) don't miss out on anything if they choose to not buy these things, however the option is there if they want to spend money on something they enjoy.The community is definitely one of the biggest things in this game, having kept it alive for 9 years as of later this year. There will be good encounters and bad encounters like everything, however, finding your place will ensure you a great time. Unfortunately, many of the pay-to play players (P2Ps for short) frown upon F2Ps, judging them as ""unskilled and foolish"" among other things of the sorts, however there are also many people who are willing to help out newcomers assuming the newby is willing to listen.Without going into too much more detail, this game should definitely be on everyone's to-play list if they haven't done so already, although just prepare yourself for a very unique experience and many great times ahead.update so that it counts for that new steam awards thing			"

												I actually like this game alot.Most people think of TF2 as a shooter game where all the players eventually get sucked into the world of hats and unusuals and strange weapons.That is very true. I've been addicted to collecting them since I started. Still don't have an unusual, but I just got my first professional killstreak weapon and I'm going to use only it for the rest of my life. :D			"

												Probably the worst FPS of all time, where your chance of winning is decided by the amount of headwear one can use. And as the heavy's head is the biggest, he is obviously the most op class. Scout is a manifestation of post-marxism homosexual propaganda masked with a Boston accent to calm the Italians. Soldier does not only suffer from heavy mental retardation he is also a extremely nationalistic American, basically male Sarah Palin. The Demoman is a anti-stereotypical to the point that it becomes offensive, trying to detract from his african american origin as much as possible. The pyro is the gimp from Pulp fiction with a flamethrower, not only is that copyright infringement but also damaging the image of latex fetishists all around the world. The sniper is the most incorrect character since 1. He is not a kangaroo and 2. He isn't upside down. The Medic is a nazi. The heavy is a false display of an incredibly overweight Putin with an insuffurable amount of brain cells. The spy is a meek attempt at poking at the french which fails by him not actually being offensive at all. 10/10 best game ever.			"

												Easily, and I mean this, easily, the best comedic FPS there is on steam. You can play from a hyped Scout kid that seems like he's on coke, a dumb in the head soldier, a crazed Pyro who thinks burning people is like spitting rainbows at fairies, a drunken demoman, an adorable yet horrifying heavy, a chill engineer who drinks on the job, a crazy headed medic who does live surgery, a professional sniper, and a classy spy who gets the job done. Point is, this game is very well developed and has had a lot of effort put into it. Though there are only 9 characters, there are hundreds of weapons that you can use too.Once you get further into the game its more addiction and entertaining, in the start it may seem boring but you just have to get a bit further into the game. You may be thinking ""How do you get far into a game without a Story..!?"" well, I meant once you get more items and learn about the game. You can play many different game modes, lots of community made game modes on the community servers, and trade servers. Theres payload race, control points, Intel missions, prop hunt, death run, and many more missions. All this for a free to play game?! GET IT "

												Before Overwatch before Battleborn there was Team Fortress 2   Originally this game was a mod for Quake  another great game in the genre but sadly hasn't aged very well.  strangely the game was originally advertized as a gritty military shooter in 1998 but the game was delayed many and finally in 2007  intead of a generic military shooter we get a unique and humorous FPS with ridiculous weapons and a colorful cast of characters featuring a cartoony artstyle that still looks great even today. and keep in mind this game came in a year when military shooters where growing stale and were taking themselves too seriously so when this game came out people felt it was a breath fresh air because this game tried something new with the genre now because TF2 did so well we have great games like Overwatch and Splatoon. This game has very fast-paced and fun multiplayer gameplay that is chalk full of well designed maps. their are 9 classes to choose from The Scout, The Heavy, The Spy, The Soldier, The Medic , The Pyro The Engineer and the Demoman each of witch have there own special abilites and fighting styles  Ok  Despite reinventing the genre  The biggest problem i have with this game is that it has microtransactions galore and anyone would agree that is bull also theirs no balance inbetween classes some of them feel weaker (The Scout  or the Medic) or just plan cheap like the Spy people aways pick the Spy because he can discise himself as other characters and take them out and that's why I hate him he is very unpredictable you walking and then all of a sudden BAM your dead. ok my haterad for the Spy class aside think this is a great game that is just as fun as it was 10 years ago My final rating is a 7/10 this goes down a point because the microtranactions are inexcusable and even though some people think Overwatch is the better game (I like Overwatch too don't get me wrong)  I still think that it's a staple in gaming that people should really experiance for themselves			"

												Alright, little boys and girls of Steam. Gather 'round the campfire and let 'ol PSi tell you a story.  It all began back in 2011, when I was but a young lad. One day, I heard multiple people discussing the game Team Fortress 2. At the time, what I heard was beyond belief. A game where I could ruthlessly murder the friends I didn't have WITH the friends I didn't have? Sign me up! Now at the time, my pockets were filled with nothing but air , lint, and broken dreams, so I was delighted to hear that this experience was being offered to me for the low, low price of absolutely nothing. Once the lengthy download was complete, I wasted no time learning the ins and outs of the game. I practiced for quite some time against bots, and once I felt I was ready to get murdered in style , I ventured out into servers filled with actual people, all of them hellbent on killing each other. My response? I simply picked up a sniper rifle, flashed a murderous grin, and uttered beneath my breath ""Let's. Freakin'. Go."" I then proceeded to get shot in the face 50 times before registering my first kill.Over the next 3 years, I was whisked away on a thrill ride that featured pyromania, robots, weapon nerfs, comics, bakery goods, and of course, hats. By this time I've spent well over 400 hours of my ""life"" playing the game and making my teammates angry by failing to snipe stationary Heavies. 3 long years without a single regret.What's that? You kids wanna experience what 'ol PSi's been through? Well I'm not stopping ya. Just head down to the Steam store, search for Team Fortress 2, and give it a download. You've got nothing to lose but countless hours of your precious little lives.			"

												Team Fortress 2 is a great game for a wide variety of gamers: it has a diversity of fun and original characters, each with their own playstyle, and even within each class you can attune the items in your loadout to your preferences. The game combines competitiveness with silliness in a very balanced way; the characters insult their opponents upon killing them in such a facetious and amusing way they can barely even be considered offensive, and yet they can drive your mind nuts about that one scout that is just too fast for you, that spy that keeps sneaking past your offensive front or that soldier that lands on your head outta freakin' nowhere! What tops this all off, is the Domination/Revenge system which induces a sharp focus on killing tough opponents, granting great satisfaction whenever you get your revenge, or better, when you get to dominate that pesky little pain in the behind that keeps bugging you throughout the round!Pros:- Completely free to play; you can make it as expensive as you want, though- Original, witty and funny characters with GREAT voice acting- Silly, yet competitive in a very balanced way- Wide variety of playstyles to suit everyone's preferences- A LOT of different weapons, WHY CANT I HOLD ALL THESE WEAPONS- Weapon qualities that give specific properties (Strange weapons that count kills, strange parts that count other achievements with a weapon, killstreak kits with an increased showoff-level etc) keep the game interesting and always give you a target to play for- Great graphics and animations! Simplicity suits this game perfectly- HATS! HATS EVERYWHERE!- IT HAS THE CONGA. I LOVE THE CONGA! need I say more?Cons- too damn addicting!- votekick system bugs, which allows trolls and cheaters to throw off an entire game (luckily only happens seldomly)Overall rating: Solid 10/10 would hat againSo if you're bored and looking for something cheap and fun to play: don't look any further - Try TF2! It's free, so you have nothing to lose (except for your free time once you start :D)			"

												Updating back my review on this game for 2 reasons. After so many years this game is still going somewhat strong. For a game this old to have a fairly strong number of players and getting updates means something. The current state of the game may not be as what it used to be before, but the actual gameplay and content still brings some fun moments and experiences. All from a free game.The other reason is to get that badge and some extra exp.			"

												Game is fun and easy going. Lots of playable characters to choose from and they are all different in abilities. I like to play as support class and I am very happy that three support class characters are so different and so I can do different things while still playing support! There are so many different maps to choose from to play in that I am sure everyone would like at last one they enjoy. Lots and lots of fun and really good game that I can't believe is free. I have had to pay for games that were not as good as Team Fortress 2!I was not sure if I would give thumbs up or not because while the game is really good, I don't think player base is good. Maybe I have had bad luck but I have run in to very rude people that did not make the game feel like fun. This game is very fun when playing with friends but going to random server always ended to me with being thrown rude comments at. Comments about me being bad at game I could take because I have played so little that I can not compare to veterans but I think that does not need foul language or people calling me with rude names and going to personal stuff. I had to see others be treated rude too and rudest comments were always given to people who play offense.I recommend the game but I do not recommend the community.			"

												What goes on in a tf2 developer's mind? hl2.exe not responding? Community: Add more weaponsThe Five Developers: Let's add more useless cosmetic itemsI would have recommended tf2 2-3 years ago, now it is a shadow of its former self. UpdatesThey are completely oblivious to the community and keep pushing out horrible major updates to steal your money. It started when they introduced End of the Line. It only added cosmetic ♥♥♥♥ and a duck journal(that you have to pay for). You level it up by collecting ducks. What a great update. A year later, Gun Mettle comes out. It introduces collections and skins - totally not from cs:go at all. You buy a cruddy pass to earn 2 weapon skins a week. No new items, only reskins. Why update the game for free when you can extort the players even more with operation passes. Skip a year and we get Meet Your Match(conveniently introduces contracts: a system that cs:go abandoned 2 months ago), an update that removes convenience for a more polished main menu. They changed quickplay to casual(like the one in cs:go where you get kicked for screwing up). Instead of taking seconds to join a game, now you have to wait longer and you can't join your friends to screw around. However, my main concern is not being able to play some maps due to less popularity. For example, I was waiting for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ matchmaking system to put me in koth_sawmill. I waited 30 minutes and it didn't match me. If you have a mix of very popular maps and less popular, then there is no chance of getting put in the less popular one. The community is getting more toxic and there are more tryhards. Then Halloween 2016 comes and adds some cosmetic stuff and is basically the same update as Halloween 2015. Now we are on the ♥♥♥♥♥how Smissmas 2016. More cosmetics. Hooray!EconomyThe economy is horrible. Keys are a type of currency used to determine a value of items. When keys were first introduced, they were around 38 weapons(2.11 ref). Now they are 29.22 and going to hit 30 ref. Since you need around 263 weapons just for a key, it will be a lot harder to profit from trading. Why trade when profiting a scrap or two isn't viable anymore? Have a gifted item? Nice! It is now worth 50% less! CollectionsIn tf2, a collection is a group of weapons (or hats) that are weighed by appearance. A weapon skin/hat on the lower tier is crap and the higher( and rarer) one is on top. It is basically a way for Valve to steal your money by intentionally making the higher tier items harder to get and worth more. There is an item called the potassium Bonnett. It is an all-class banana hat. It is all yours if you fork in around 24 dollars. Great deal right? The system is from csgo, a more successful game. They made sure that minimal effort was spent on it. Industrial(♥♥♥♥) -> Civilian. Covert -> Elite. If they want to change tf2 into csgo, then at least change the title to tf:go.Skin Quality TiersTo compliment the already absurd collections ""feature"", Valve also made sure tf2 has wore down ♥♥♥♥. Instead of getting a whole item, why not add wear to each one? The drastic price differences makes sure all players rich and poor can buy cosmetic item. Don't like the wear? Why not upgrade that ♥♥♥♥ and get one with less scratches. It gunna look gud on me square fingers. Tf2 before: Upgrades to strange festive. Tf2 after: It has too many scratches. *Upgrades to strange factory new, adds festivizer, transfers kills to gun.GameplayPlaying the game can be fun, but there is a lot of things I dislike. The matches usually go two ways: your teams gets plowed or your team steamrolls the other. Usually when my team is not the best, the enemy team spawncamps with medics ubering near our spawn. The respawn time is around 14-20s and I don't want to spend 30-40 by dying instantly. However, it is not as bad as the spawncamping/camping on capture the flag maps. If your team isn't good on 2fort, then good luck. You should expect stickies near your spawn doors, enemy engis camping your team's intel room, soldiers with pocket medics roaming the corridors, and much more. There is also a feature called autobalance. It makes sure both teams have around the same amount of players. The developers actually improved it. Instead of picking a person who dies first(not top player), it asks you if you want to join the other team. After you accept, you get an experience boost(doesn't do anything). Another great feature is team assignment. Now I dont fight other people to join a team.  Those ♥♥♥♥s would get me autobalanced and take my slot, ruining the fun for me. The exp is used to level you up and slightly modifies the badge you get for every level. There is no point of having the badge besides being a ♥♥♥♥ to your friends and showing them your glorious badge. Then realize you wasted part of your life on a slighty-modified badge. There are also a lot of client side and server side problems. A classic is taking cover behind a stationary object and dying due to the server thinking you are not hiding. It is the same with hitboxes. Also sometimes when I headshot something, there is visible blood, but no damage dealt. Lastly, the influx of cosmetics is stupid(although I am fine with some cosmetics). Want a glowing cosmetic hat? Prepare to clean your wallet to get an item that shows how much of a moron you are. I realized that too late. The dev team also went to the point of adding effects to tips of muzzles. You have to be a real doofus to waste your money on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ item modification. I installed the game to have fun, not play ""dressup"" (Screen Junkies). Furthermore, people have a negative connotation where gibus(new) users are stupid and need to be removed because they don't have a lot of items. People even go as far as votekicking them for trying to enjoy the game. I expect cs;go players to do it, but not tf2. CompetitiveTf2 is a more casual and goofy game. The ding-dongs at Valve didn't think so and thought that it was a great idea to incorporate something that cs:go is famous for. Join the ranks as one of the best players on tf2. Not P2P nor have a usable phone? No worries! Just pay us $10. We made sure it is affordable by including a 50% discount forever. At least cs:go had guns you can buy; tf2 has nothing for competitive. It is just a rehashed version of casual. We get nothing. Mann Co. StoreThe Mann Co. Store is a place where you buy stuff from a greedy ape(Saxton Hale). Every item in there is a rip off. A new taunt can cost around 5 dollars(2 keys) and devalue to 2.5 dollars(1 key) within a week. It has great deals: sombrero for 13 dollars (93 times higher than the actual price) (1.33ref). It also has a campaign pass that is forever 50% off.MvMMann vs. Machine is an alternative gamemode to tf2 tdm. You murder robots and loot their metal  corpses. You then spend the money on upgrades to your stats or weapons. It might sound fun, but it hasn't had a single major update since Two Cities, which was three years ago. Want to get loot? Sure, buy a tod ticket(1 dollar). Are you generous and want to help your team? Buy a surplus voucher(1.99 dollars) to grant your teammates an extra weapon! After buying tod tickets, you get to wait anywhere from 2-20 minutes to get matched up. Then buy more tod tickets to complete other maps. Then finish the tour and realized you blew (#) of dollars to get crap worth a couple of cents. Don't want to play for the loot? Try bootcamp! The state-of-the art matchmaking system is sure to match you with a terrible group where losing is inevitable.ConclusionThe game was good once, now it is horrible. I don't know why I keep lingering around tf2. Everyday I launch the game and join a server, it is even more disappointed than the last. I probably won't completely quit until June. Valve breathed life into a game and savagely stabbed it to death. At least it will end my gaming addiction.Reserved for future: upcoming fiascos (pyro,summer,etc) and better organization			"

												Let's start.Team Fortress 2 it's a FPS (First Person Shooter) game made by Valve and published in 2007, after the beta. The game has nine classes:ATTACK CLASSES:°Scout°Soldier°PyroDEFENSE CLASSES:°Demoman°Heavy°EngineerSUPPORT CLASSES.°Medic°Sniper°SpyEach class has his advantages and disadvantages. For example a Spy can kill easily a Heavy, but at the same time he can be get killed by a Pyro. Or a Scout can kill without problem a Sniper or an Engineer, but at the same time he can be killed by Demomen or Soldiers.This system of advantages and disadvantages makes the game very funny.The game has also a drop system, which allows to find randomly new weapons and, if lucky, new hats. Infact the game has a lot of weapons, which can be unlocked with achievements (Example: The Force-A-Nature) or can be picked randomly during a game. Each weapons has his own advantages and disadvantages, making the game balanced. For example the Phlogistinator, a Pyro weapon, can gain easily crits but it can't use the compressor (which is essential for airblasting projectiles). The game has also a lot of hats, which makes Team Fortress 2 a original FPS. The player can use the hats for customizing his own character. Hats can be purchased by the Mann. Co Store or being traded for refined metal (Which is the ""money"" of the game). The game has also a trading system, which allows players to trade weapons and hats, keeping the ""TF2 economy"" alive.Now let's see what it is inside the game!Team Fortress 2 has a lot of gamemodes, for example Attack/Defense or Capture the Flag.In Attack/Defense the BLU must cap every RED's point. The BLU will win if they will cap every point before the time expires, otherwise the RED will win.The TF2 community is always active, expecially on trading, but I don't refuse to say that in the community there are some disrispectful and discriminating people, often following the ideology ""You have no hats? You're a noob!"". Beside this the community is quite friendly.Now my personal opinion:I play this game since 23 May 2014 and it never tired me. I enjoy playing this game because it's wonderful how you can meet new friends and working with them for win the match. Every character has his own stereotype, and this make me laugh (in positive sense, of course). I think Team Fortress 2 was born as team-working FPS and not ""I'm the most pro player in the game!11"". And that is just wonderful.I say thanks to Valve and thanks to Gaben for making this fantastic game, which is my favorite.Thanks a lot.FINAL VOTE:Gameplay: 10/10Sounds and music: 9/10Graphic: 9/10 (It's quite old but I like that style)(Sorry for my bad English, but I'm from Italy!)

Let me be honest with you. The way Valve treats this game nowadays is underwhelming. The developers make changes that make me scratch my head sometimes.However, I am still coming back to this game every week for multiple reasons.The creative community, the casual fun, countless of custom maps and much more. (Like hats)Even after 2000 hours I still feel like there is so much more to learn.Team Fortress 2 is by far my favorite game of all time.So yeah, for every person who is into class-based shooters I say, why not try it out?It's free. With no pay to win elements.They seriously need to optimize though. It's lagging like crazy. "

												2017:Need 2 update. Review is a bit innacurate.====This is the single most entertaining online FPS on the market right now.Team Fortress 2 is a free-to-play online class-based first person shooter which pits two teams of nine classes against each other in various game modes and challenges. Players can unlock weapons and cosmetic items by completing achievements or winning them through death (though this is random and has a limit which is reset each week). While some bonus weapons are borderline direct upgrades, the unfortunate Scout is still extremely powerful with his stock weaponry, for example. These extra weapons are more comparable to VARIATIONS than upgrades - most of them are designed as side-grades. The only example I can think that is really overpowered is the Medic's Übersaw, but why the hell would you get close to a Medic anyway? His normal Bonesaw can tear you to shreds just as easily, if not EASIER. My point is that unlike other free-to-play games, you can have plenty of variety and do just as well as a similarly-skilled player with your normal or bonus weapons.Let's talk about the classes: there are 9 in total, with at least 3 weapons each. They are divided by 3 groups, the Offense, the Defense and the Support. But these groups are useless labels. I'll play by Valve's rules, though. Let's see...On the Offense, we have the Scout: the fast-as-crap, annoying ♥♥♥♥wad who can kill you easily while up close. He can also double-jump! Meanwhile, he's borderline useless at long range.Next up, the Soldier: he has a rocket launcher. The rockets' damage degrade over distance, so long-range spamming isn't a huge deal. He is slow as ♥♥♥♥ on his own, but since he can rocket jump, he is literally one of the most mobile classes in the game.Lastly, the Pyro: he burns you. A lot. He also can extinguish friendlies on fire with his flamethrower's compression blast, which is ALSO USEFUL TO REFLECT ENEMY PROJECTILES (not including bullets, of course). This is a huge feature that makes the Pyro really stand out. Educate yourself on the Pyro and he's far more useful than just his job of burning enemy spies.Let's check out the Defense. First off, we have the Demoman. As his name suggests, he is a demolitions man, and he can blow ♥♥♥♥ up easily. He has a grenade launcher and a stickybomb launcher, and the latter needs to have it's projectiles blown up on-demand. He can have 8 sticky grenades (or ""stickies"") active at once. This class is really good at defending an area and blowing up buildings by the Engineer.Before the hardhat, we have the big tub of russian meat called the Heavy: he has a minigun which WILL tear you a new one up close. Boasting the largest default health pool in the game, he is a force to be reckoned with. However, by himself, just like anyone else, he is pretty useless. So don't get too confident.Now we have the Engineer, one of the most unique classes in this game. Aside from his Shotgun + Pistol, he has a Wrench and 2 PDAs for construction and destruction, respectively. He can build a Sentry Gun, a Dispenser and a Teleport Entrance/Exit. They all can be upgraded up to Level 3, which improves their peformance.Finally we have the Support classes. This is probably the least misleading label, because they ARE support classes, therefore, YOU DON'T NEED A MILLION OF THEM AT ONCE.Let's start with my favourite class, the Medic: Hohoho boy, seen as a pansy man of medicine, he has a syringe gun which can really hurt a careless someone and a bonesaw which REALLY hurts too. His greatest power however is the Medigun; with it, the Medic can heal a person up to 150% of their health, and once his Ubercharge meter is filled, he can turn himself and his healing target invincible for 8 seconds. He can also heal two targets quickly while deploying his Ubercharge to have them both invincible aswell, but the duration of the Uber will be decreased to 5 seconds. If you're even FASTER, you can have 3 people on godmode too!! But it'll be over so soon that it's not worth it.Now we have the Sniper: as his name suggests, he has a Sniper Rifle, the only stock weapon in the game that can Headshot people. I don't have much to say about this one. Just have good judgment, PLEASE. This class is nearly useless in some situations - if the situation demands it, swap. There are just too many sniper teams that lose so easily to teams with varied classes.Another overused class is the Spy, also a very unique character: He can cloak, aswell as backstab people with his knife for a guaranteed instant kill, given they aren't Ubercharged by the default Medigun. He also has a Sapper, which disables Engineer buildings and after a while they blow up. When used correctly and sparsely, he is an EXTREMELY dangerous fellow. Again, solo judgment please: if you already have more than two of these in your team (in normal 12x12 games), don't switch to a Spy.That takes care of the classes. What about the maps?!Oh good lord, there are so many official and custom maps that it'd be impossible to describe them all. There are quite a few official modes aswell: Control Points (CP), Payload (PL), King of the Hill (KOTH), Capture the Flag (CTF), Special Delivery (SD), Payload Race (PLR) and Mann vs Machine (MVM)In CP, it depends. There are Attack/Defense maps, which has BLU attacking the RED control points, and there are 5CP maps, in which both teams need to be in control of all of the control points to win.In Payload, the BLU team needs to push a railed cart into the RED base to win. Of course, RED needs to stop them.In King of the Hill, you have a central point which needs to be captured by one team and held for 3 total minutes. It's pretty much the same as KOTH in other games.In Capture the Flag, the team needs to go get the enemy's briefcase and bring it to their briefcase's spawn point. It's the same as every other CTF game, but the flags are briefcases and their returns are timed - you can't grab your own briefcase to return it.Special Delivery is a 1-point CTF mode, where one team needs to go get the briefcase somewhere in the central edges of the map and bring it to the opposite central edge. Like in normal CTF, the return is timed, and only one team can have control of the briefcase at a time.Payload Race is an absurd one. Both teams need to push their own cart while stopping the enemy from pushing THEIR cart. It gets pretty crazy and it's quite fun.In Mann VS Machine, you have one team against an army of ROBOTS based on the classes (and a Tank). They come in waves and it's the only mode where you can upgrade your weapons and have a special canteen to hold bonuses.There are custom game modes aswell, such as WarioWare Minigames, Surf, 1v1 MGE Training, Team Deathmatch, vs Saxton Hale (A Juggernaut/""1 versus Everyone else"" mode) etc. Once you've gotten pretty good at the game, you can try out competitive TF2, where you'll learn a much higher degree of teamwork, coordination and combat in comparison to normal public servers!And the weapons? Good lord, there are so many that I'd lose count. Let's leave them as a surprise, yes?My only nitpick with this game is it's... optimization. It's not that well optimized. At all, actually. This is due to the over-abundance of updates since the last 4 years, but luckily, you can get custom configuration files to fix this problem somewhat. I've also heard if your game gets cluttered with custom content, you can reinstall it for a fresh new start and have the game running amazingly, but I have never tried it.Sounds like fun? I'm sure it does, and it gets better when you start playing. So, what are you waiting for?! Some final words? A numerical value?? SEVERAL ONES, MAYBE?? Fine, but I'll get you just one! Here's your damn score:TF2 gets a score of 9/10. It's extremely fun and it never gets old. It IS counter-intuitive at first, but when you get used to it, it's awesome!			"

												Absolutely awesome game! A great range of classes to choose from. Scout is a fast running class that is mostely used for doing the map objective (capture the flag, pushing cart) and just generally annoying people. Soldier is a slow moving class armed with a rocket launcer, a shotgun, and a entrenching tool (shovel) soldier is one of the main damage dealers in team fortress 2. The Pyro is a masked psycho armed with a flame thrower, a shotgun, and a fire axe. Pyro is again a main damage dealer but instead he/she uses his/hers flame thrower to burn enemies alive. The Demolitions Man (demo man) is much like the soldier with explosive weapons instead a grenade launcher, a sticky bomb launcher (manually exploded bombs that stick to walls etc)and a bottle! The demoman is a main damage dealer aswell but used as a defence class because of his sticky bomb launcher to make traps he is also very drunk! xD. The Heavy weapons guy is as you guess, a guy with big ♥♥♥ weapons! he carries a minigun, a shotgun and uses his fists to punch people! Heavy is the God of damage dealing, he can kill all the other classes quite easily, but be careful! Heavy is a very slow class and is quite vulnerable to take damage from behind!The engineer. The engineer is a defence class that creates Sentry guns to defend, he can upgrade his sentry 3 times. level 1 being a normal sentry, level 2 being two chainguns on the side and level 3 with a rocket launcher on the top!The medic is the support class healing his teammates who are in need of help, the medic is the second fastest class in team fortress 2 he also has a thing called Uber charge, which is you and the person you're healing have a few seconds of invulnerability. The sniper is a long ranged Damage dealer he uses a powerful Sniper rifle, a SMG and a machete the sniper can take out most classes in a quickshot however you can keep scoped in to fill a meter which makes your shots more powerful, when this meter is full you can take out a heavy in one shot in the head! The spy is a very different class... The silent assassin, the spy carries a revolver, a knife and a electro-sapper the electro-sapper is used for destroying enemy engineer's sentry guns although the engineer can destroy these sappers that doesn't mean that you can't backstab him! an important role in the spy is to backstab people with your knife to instantly kill your target the spy has the ability to make himself temporarily invisible and has the ability to disguise as the enemy team to fool them! That is all the classes in team fotress 2! I hope this review was helpful and i hope to see you on a server! Good bye-Jarhead			"

												Ever since the last Halloween event the game is becoming less and less enjoyable. The worst part was the Meet Your Match update. You can no longer just join steam friends, unless asking them and waiting for them to finish game. Matches last like 5-10 minutes and your team either gets destroyed or you are destroying the other team. Very rarely there's a balanced match. Whoever enjoys competitive gameplay will enjoy this, but whoever just wants to spend like 30 minutes of spare time, it wouldn't be such a good experience.Valve became too lazy to update anything, or should I say the number of people working on anything related to the game (bug fixes, updates...) decreased dramatically. That definitely decreased the quality of the updates. They're even too lazy to modify the last major update we had on the store page (which stays Tough Break now, released almost a year ago). Events like Scream Fortress were really enjoyable in past years, because Valve always added something new. For the past 2 years they rely only on the community to create a few maps and that's everything new about the event.For the time being I cannot recommend this game to newcomers.			"

												This game was great and fun. Met some of my friends on here. Those were some good times. I just wish Valve could focus on this game more and then maybe I could have the same fun I had back then. 5 and a half years of playing this game and it's been a great experience I gotta say. I remember a lot from it. But now the game's community is slowly dying and it's sad. Would be nice to experience it all over again but we all move on eventually. This game could have been greater but that's not saying it isn't. The score I give it now is for when this game was great and not how it is now. I hope one day this game gets to be bigger than it is now. And then maybe we can still keep our hats.10/10			"

												What happened.  No seriously, what happened to this game.  I feel it all started going downhill after the introducton of promotional and cosmetic items that didn't fit the style.  Now it's a wasteland of community models with precisely zero quality control, extremely awful optimization, a billion weapon reskins, the scamm-co store, traders, and an utterly broken menu system.  Valve's quickplay devastated custom map servers by not listing them, something that caused many  to shut down completely and disband a lot of great communities.  The End of the Line update was an inarguable disaster that even the most hardcore valve fanboy couldn't defend with broken promises and no actual content.  And finally there's the trainwreck known as meet your match.  The only reason I still play is because I have an old bunch of friends I can go back to.  To anyone who actually reads this past the idiotic and useless ""POOTIS"" comments on the front page just know what this game has become, it's been a long time since 2007.			"

												Team Fortress 2 is a cartoony MMOFPS with a super-dose of character, and more pop references than you can handle in one sitting. Players play one of 9 mercenary classes working for one of two corporations (RED and BLU) duking it out tooth-and-nails over a variety of objectives ranging from briefcases, to giant bombs in mine carts. With a tons of weapons, achievements, hats and maps, this game has incredible longevity, and will keep you latched to your screen hoping for that one achievement, or that specific weapon(Golden Pan for me) you’re looking to get.Classes:Spy(My Fav): Proficient knife fighter and mother lover, the spy can feign death/cloak and disguise himself into the enemy team.Demoman: Trap-setting, one-eyed Scottish demoman with a knack for blowing things to pieces. Is surprisingly good with a claymore.Engineer: Texan cowboy with a knack for turret building. Incredibly efficient at point defense, you’ll grow to love or hate his turrets.Heavy: Chain gun wielding boxer, the medic’s best friend. With a massive health pool, this is both the damage soaking, and damage dealing class.Medic: Mad doctor wielding a surgery saw to battle. Specializes in deploying ubercharges on teammates, making them invincible for a short time.Pyro: Axe-wielding pyromaniac specialized in ambushes, and generally setting living things on fire.Scout: Super-fast class that uses its speed to outmatch opponents and quickly capture points.Sniper: Long-range shooter with a knack for throwing jars of suspicious yellow liquids.Soldier: Frontline tough guy with a rocket launcher, and a lot of punch.

Two scouts lept over the nearby hill and starting beating me with fish, and I ran up to the nearest teammate I could find, and the scouts left.Two minutes later, I have full Ubercharge, find the same teammate, kritz him, and he's a spy and he shoots me in the face, then dances on my corpse.Then he got blown up by a random crit sticky.10/10 would spend too much of my ♥♥♥♥ing money on hats again			"

												Meet your match, This review change is long overdue, but here it is.This update DESTROYED MOST OF THE GAME.Pubs were easy to access, and fun to play on, but what's that? Valve have become the ♥♥♥♥ing fun police and removed those and added ""Casual and competitive servers""? You've gotta be jokin' mate.Casual started out with HORRIBLY LONG WAITING TIMES, I haven't touched competitive because it's not really my cup of tea. BUT Casual is a MESS! Hackers, Lack of map decision. But at the start of casual, the part that made it a trainwreck? Leaving penalties. IT'S A DAMN GAME OF CASUAL! And they removed autobalance, woohoo right? 6v12 is fun especially when it becomes that when 6 of your salty teammates leave because they lost, boo ♥♥♥♥in' hoo.Now, the Hackers, my least favourite thing to deal with.The most infamous are either Dab squad or VAC Police, Both game ruiners, They're not in competitive, but c'mon. Comp's usuallt filled with edgy salty tryhards, not great individuals to deal with.But the biggest minus about removing quickplay, IS THAT IT KILLED A GOD DAMN SERVER.""but roo what suver did voov kell?"" you may be asking,TF2APP, They're shutting down soon, or hell, already shut down. Valve are gonna do that ""We're sorry, we'll patch it soon."" ♥♥♥♥, like they always do.Heavy VS Pyro was a thing that after like a week, nobody gave a ♥♥♥♥ about. Pyro won, (go figure, valve hate russians and love aliens apparently.) And He'll probably be given another buff, and an ungodly weapon which does insane damage, Phlog 2.0 Basically. Give the development to somebody who gives a ♥♥♥♥, Like the community. They're making tons of cool, creative things and like what, 10% of it actually gets in? The community clearly know better, and actually give a ♥♥♥♥ about the life of the game and not how much revenue it makes.Frankly Valve, you need to get up off your arses and make some Actual ♥♥♥♥in' content. Do your devs even play the damn game? Because it clearly looks like they don't.The review's staying positive because i've been spending time on community servers, but still.God damn.			"

We have to start with the classes.You can be Scout, and be obnoxiously quick and capture quickly.You can be Soldier, and be slow but damaging on the battlefield.You can be Pyro, and clear out control pointss in seconds.You can be Demo, and guard hallways with sticky bombs,You can be Heavy, and be a crazy russian attacker,You can be Engineer, and put sentry nests straight outside the opposite teams spawn,You can be Medic, and extremely help your team out,You can be Sniper, and get a lot of headshots,And you can be Spy, and you can buttstab people :DThe commmunity is also great. Sometimes you may come across one or two idiots but thats any game, really.The price for items is also alright. Although not great, if some hats are worth more that ain't that problem.And the servers are fun and hack-proof (usually) Unless you play on Aimbot servers, in which GTFO.Overall i think you shouold download this game right now and step into the shoes of Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demo, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy!!!!!

The only reason I still play this is the small hope that my favorite servers eventually getting more than two people on at a time... And even that doesn't look promising anymore.			"

												As someone who's been playing TF2 for 4 1/2 years, I can say that this game, at one point, was a good game, that the developers cared about. I've noticed that for a LONG while, the developers of this game, just simply stopped caring as much. I mean, don't get me wrong, they still released occasional updates, bug fixes when they were needed, but as soon as competetive was announced for TF2, that's when it all started going downhill.It all started with the gun mettle update, when everyone realized that the developers of TF2 had stopped thinking, when they copied the concept of weapon skins from CS:GO without even attempting to hide it. I'm not saying that it was a bad thing entirely, as weapon skins introduced a new form of trading into TF2, an entirely new market that players who weren't interested in cosmetics could get into, as they affected your point of view in game, and were still as valued as said cosmetics. A lot of things were added in the gun mettle update, that quite litteraly nobody asked for. For example, community maps that nobody liked even before they were added into the game, adding text to certain weapons 'i.e. flare gun' where they added text to it, that said ""100% crit chance on burning targets"", something of which litteraly everybody knew, and nobody asked for. Not saying it was a bad addition, of course, just an unnecesary one.Anyway, moving on from gun mettle, the next major update that hit, the Tough Break update, an amazing update, where the absolute genuis' at Valve headquarters looked at the most complained-about weapon in the game (Phlogistinator), and decided to buff it. Why? Eh, why not? Team Fortress 2, everyone knew was gonna die one day, why not kill it a bit faster? They decided to take a weapon that was already considered by many 'Overpowered', and make it much more OP. Few MONTHS later, they decided to nerf the phlog, which everyone was happy about, but they nerfed it in such a way, that questions whether or not they actually put thought into it, who knows, maybe they just nerfed it so that players who quit would come back, and spend more money on weapon skins and cosmetics. Why am I using this as a point? Because, it's evidence that valve barely listened to their community, and quite frankly, doesn't give a goats ♥♥♥ what happens to it, as long as they can still milk money off of weapon crates, they're all happy. Anyway, done with that absolute mess of an update, now let's move on to a somehow BIGGER mess of an update, one that actually brought this game down from 'Overwhelmingly positive' to 'Very positive'. In case you haven't noticed, this game's current review ratings of this month are 'Mostly positive' at 76% positive. While in most cases, this wouldn't be such a bad thing, this game was at 90% monthly ratings just prior to this update, meaning that it's safe to assume that 14% of the average reviewers were also heavily displeased with this update, to where it actually made the game worse in quality. This update forces all 'casual' players to play like it's 'competitive'. Why? Because, Valve just wants to do the right things, but in such, SUCH terrible ways. Yes, they've brought in an official competitive update with this, something the fans have been asking for such a long time, which some players were happy about, but now, they're forcing everyone who plays their game to play it 'Competitively', and not casualy, because calling something 'Casual' and treating it like competitive doesn't make it casual, now does it? One last thing I should mention: The TF2 economy. Yes, this game has an economy, one that, at one point, was litteraly more stable than some third world countries, but there were certain sites that specialized in dealing items, and other sites that gave the items a price, some of which standing at $4,000. Yes, really, thousands of dollars on a virtual hat, which is just evidence that TF2 has an economy of its own, however, Valve, having made it, seemed not to have cared about it.  Reintroducing harder-to-get items, sometimes of absurd prices into newer, WAY more common crates for.... Well, because it's to appeal to newer players, I guess? A perfect example of this would be the Strange Kritzkrieg, an item only obtainable through either trade, or opening a crate that costs about $20 USD, it may have risen since then, I'm not sure, but anyway, Valve thought it would've been absolutely genius to bring this item into a new crate. No, not a rare crate, those don't exist anymore, a crate that you can find from breathing air. What did this do to the item? It drastically brought it's price down, simply because Valve doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ what happens to this economy, as long as there's more of an item being bought, they're happy, since they get tax money off of community market transactions.Anyway, to wrap things up, TF2 was a game with such good potential, going on for 9 years without dying, but unfortunately, unless Valve ACTUALLY brings in a good update, that isn't just milking the game out of as much money as possible, this game will most certainly die soon. Until then, I'll keep this negative review up, until something's done about this negligence, ignorance, and overall just confusion on decisions.			"

												This game had it´s ups and downs with it´s more recent updates that changed the way you played. The meet your match update which completely removed quickplay and introduced casual mode, was the turning point which started it all. The game was unplayable on day one due to the extremely long queue times and the strong possibility of ending up on a match that was already half way over. (Which still is a problem)However,with the times comes great changes. The last big update of smissmas 2016 was a big step in the right direction. Now you can stay in the same server with all the people on it,as to before where you had to completely leave and find a new server. However,another big change was the return of the well hated ""Autobalance"". Previously before the Meet your Match update,there was a chance that any player could be automatically be placed on the opposing team when the numbers of team players was unbalanced. This caused some outrage amongs the ones who where autobalanced to the other team,which didn´t help the team in the slightest.Now with the new Autobalanced system,a player is asked to switch teams with the reward of extra exp. That sounds nice on paper,until you realize how useless exp really is. You get no reward for leveling up,besides a badge which does absolutely nothing. If they really want the autobalance to work,then the whole exp system needs a rework. Why not give the player a new cosmetic item as a reward for leveling up? You could make it untradeable,so the market doesn´t get affected by it.Overall,the new update improved a lot of flaws that was the new casual mode,but it doesn´t mean that all problems have been resolved yet.

If you try to kill one, karma will strike back!~Sandvich eating hoovies because they make the best picnics. They have a very warm, welcoming environment who'll dance and be friendly to anyone if they do the same back.~Phlog still has yet to be removed from the game. ~Sleep? Who needs sleep when you got Tf2? Cancel all of my jobs because I need my Tf2~Merasmus needs to get the bonus ducks back because ducks are everything.~Hats which makes you 10x better at the game apparently.Overall: 7/10. It's not even realistic. How do you aim down sights with your pistol or shotgun? Not even soldier's helmet protects you from headshots, and pistols don't instant kill an enemy when aimed at the head. In conclusion, it's an okay game, but needs more realism~IGN			"

It's all team based and fun, no class is more important then any other class.It's not all self based like Call Of Duty, you work with your team to win.Team Fortress 2 also has unique weapons that help you in combat.On the other hand, I HAD to talk about HATS.Some people play just for the hats, I play for usually both of them.If you're looking for a great F2P game, this is the game for you.Hope you have fun!

												I have playd years of Avp1, avp2 and Counterstrike. before i tryed this out. At first i left the game after about 30h, but when i started playing this again, i noticed how amazing game it is.The humor in this game is best ive seen in ANY fps multiplayer, and once you have played for a while, you can notice communications while playing whitout anyone even using any words. (people use voice communications/gestures to really complex lengths) (+you can start massive sandvich eating fests whit pootis heavies, and throw freakking ♥♥♥♥ at people before killing and taunting at them xD)But it isnt just about the humor, when trying to become good in this game, youll notice how there are skills in this game that other games of the same gengre dont have as much. Learning these skills, (rocket jumping, spys mindtricks, building placements etc. is extremely hard but rewarding) Also the character responsibilty in competetive game is quite massive.And then there is the humongously large itemworld, you can create character sets from so many items, that its extremely rare to find someone whit exact same set. You can earn items by random drops by just playing, and crafting them to better ones later on. Or you can play MvM tours to get quite rare ones, or open boxes.And the best part is that the items do not give you better stats, instead they give you option to play differently.Summary: Youll get grazy action like no other, skills hilarious comedy, the community is the best ive seen in a game this popular, and free updates that have been distributed for many years.Best of all, its Fun to play and competetive at the same time.Cheers GabeN			"

												Radically different from the going FPS standard.A gem gameplay wise.It's free, there's no excuse not to give it a try.That was the short version.If that didn't convince you yet, move along.The mechanics the 9 playable classes are based on are remarkably creative and pretty unique:While one class is able to perform a Mario-style doublejump, another can literally blow back enemy missiles at their rightful owners' faces, and then there's a soldier whose playstyle revolves around surfing on exploding rockets' knockback - just to graze a third of the available characters.The variety in gameplay is still increased by unlockable gear for each of them. And believe me, whether you're going to fight your foes with a pistol or a glass of milk DOES make a difference.Talking about unlocks, a widespread disease of free to play games with unlockable content are those being ""pay to win"" options - not in Team Fortress 2.Owning more items than yor foe will not ensure you an advantage; either all their upsides are balanced by negative side-effects or they are purely cosmetic. This makes the game very beginner friendly because it prevents new players from being straight-down outgunned (additionally all of the gameplay-relevant stuff is easily obtainable for everyone; you recieve a free item every ~40 minutes of playtime) while it also allows advanced players to customize their characters to both, visually and gameplay-wise, better meet their taste.Combat itself too breaks away from the norm in many (positive) ways.There's a static health pool instead of the genre-established regenerative system, and although revolving around mid-ranged combat, this game shows a complete lack of assault-rifles of any kind.I guess the most noticable difference to other games of the multiplayer-FPS-genre though is that confrontations between players typically last significantly longer, with fights designed around the recieving party nearly always having a chance to react - which is something I greatly appreciate, for that's what I personally feel titles like Call of Duty are lacking.There's only few negative things to mention about the gameplay mechanics; minor annoyances such as the 'randomness' damage-modifier and an at times wonky melee hit registration (though, that's a flaw shared by literally every multiplayer game there is) are just that: Minor annoyances.Eventually they don't spoil your overall expirience.Although 7 years old, the game still is steadily growing and updated regularily, with bug fixes, balance patches, new maps, items and game-modes being released every month or two, ensuring you won't end up bored.So, to recap:Whether you are casually or competitively motivated,whether you like proving your skill against other players, or prefer fighting alongside them against hordes of robots,whether you like stealth, traps, mobility-based combat, or sniping,whether you want to beat your foes by setting up turrets or slapping them with fish,you _will_ find something to enjoy in this game.And yeah.The only thing it costs you is the time it takes to download.9.5/10, would will play again.

												I got the game along with “the Orange Box” back in 2007. Of course, Team Fortress Classic was, like Portal, just a side character where the protagonist was really Half-life 2 Episode Two. Before I begin on Team Fortress 2, allow me to spend a paragraph or two on its predecessor. (Skip the next 2 paragraphs if you are not interested)More than a decade ago, during the era of 56kbps internet and much frustration for both the internet users and phone callers alike, I bought a disc which contains a number of Half-Life mods, including the all-time famous “Counter-Strike 1.5”. I was very fond of this little piece of gem back then, as downloading a 500mb file is near impossible. Little did I know that I will be spending most of my time on something else that I have no idea what it as back then, a mod that goes by the name of “Team Fortress Classic”.“Team Fortress Classic” has one of the most versatile first-person-shooter gameplay back then when compared to contenders such as “Counter-Strike”. Although the original concept of Team Fortress is based upon the battle between two teams with nine different classes, I am more personally attached to the party-style gameplay which its custom maps have to offer. With over a thousand of maps to choose from, it is possible for me to find myself in the most peculiar yet fascinating maps and situations. I could be playing volleyball or basketball using rockets, or partying in a pub while trying to sneak pass a Heavy-Weapon-Dude-Bouncer; I could be roaming around Osaka or Sahara; I could be defending or capturing a point, massacring or being massacred by a heavy, or even laughing my butt off. Yes, it was fun, and it was hell of an epic party each night.That was more than a decade ago, and then came “Team Fortress 2”, sitting with its peers in an orange package. The question is not whether the game is good or not, but whether can it continue its predecessor’s legacy. It has been 7 years since its release and time did tell that Team Fortress 2 is more than competent in continuing its predecessor’s legacy, though the effect was not immediate.As with most online multiplayer server-based First Person Shooters, Team Fortress 2 started off as something that is quite weak and linear. The community for Team Fortress 2 was still building up back then and there isn’t much community-made customizations back then, something that is very important in laying a foundation of a multiplayer game so that its longevity can be sustained. The only major improvements between Team Fortress Classic and Team Fortress 2 is that the later has an improved cartoon-like skin, which is more suiting for its party-like gameplay nature, and an item system which was pretty weak back then. The rest are pretty much the same.Time pass and the community grew as the old source engine becomes outdated. A larger variety of weapons begin to appear, and the community start coming up with a variety of mods. From Saxton Hale campaigns (boss fights) to Prop Hunts (Hide and Seek), and then to the official Mann VS Machine mods (Coop game-play), the legacy of Team Fortress Classic begins to take form within Team Fortress 2 at a foundation which is even more solid than its predecessor. Team Fortress 2 stood the testament of time and the size of the community surged. This is even truer when the game went free. I’ve had my share of fun, laughter and tears (due to laughter), and I have met my clique of friends where whom I have remained intimate as we journeyed through different games while transcending beyond the boundary of Steam. Team Fortress 2 has came a long way, and, although the results might not be immediate, it sure is worth your investment of time. Oh and if you are wondering, hats are never my interest.			"

												Probably one of the best games I have ever played. It has a great community (aside from the occasional squeaker), incredible gameplay, beautiful graphics, and a weapon system that is diverse, but rather than one weapon being particularly ""better"" than another, they are more adaptibe to different play styles, something that is not very popular in games these days. Although there are players who have been playing exponentially longer than me, I usually feel like I can get a decent number of points without having to intensely practice. Overall, Team Fortress 2 is just an incredible game, and I couldn't reccomend it more.			"

												This shooting game where cosmetics are more important than weapons introduces the player to a world where two teams of mercenaries fight each other in various modes like King of the Hill, Payload Race and Capture the Flag. There is also the Mann vs Machine mode where a small team fights giant hordes of robots.Play as the 9 different mercenaries, each with their own abilities and personality quirks. No matter your skill or playing style, there's a class that suits it!You'll surely enjoy this game that never gets old thanks to the frequent updates that bring new content such as hats, maps, weapons and gamemodes. And the best part is that it's NOT pay to win, since the game is well balanced and you can get weapons for free fairly easily. Your only concern will be getting more cosmetics!Team Fortress 2 is pure multiplayer fun, and one of the best games I've ever played.			"

It's a super fun shooter that never gets old. With multiple game modes like KOTH, Payload, Attack/Defense, CP, and MvM it doesn't really get old. Trading is also quite fun if you can put some money and time into the game. I highly recommend everyone to try out considering it's free anyways.10/10.			"

												Team Fortress 2 is definitely one of the best FPS ever made; This does nothing but confirm the supremacy of Valve Software for this sort. Although many people think that the lack of interactivity and respect of physics in the game can be a big flaw, ultimately would prove to be an important aspect for all gamers who want to have fun without too much energy			"

												I bought the game when it was still $20. It was the first game I had ever bought on Steam, and around that time in fall of 2008 there were only three characters updated with achievement weapons. Trading and hats weren't in existence yet, and the game truly was a ""teamwork required"" type of game. Every class felt balanced and fair, with each one having their own respective strengths and weaknesses. Even the achievement weapons brought a nice change of pace from the normal minigun and bonesaw. You actually felt accomplished when you did the achievements because you were rewarded. The community was surprisingly welcoming, and a majority of my Steam friends came from TF2. At the time, we had thought that Valve was going to update the rest of the characters with their own achievements and that would be all; and for awhile, we were right. One by one the rest of the classes got their own weapons and achievements, and by July 8th 2010 (Happy Birthday to me!), the Engineer was the last character updated. The game felt complete, three years in the making. Now... I think everyone knows what's coming next. Before I get into detail on the update that changed (or in my opinion, ruined) everything, let me just say that Valve had already put hats into the game months before, way back in August 2009. I was perfectly fine with the hats, they added a sense of personality to your classes and all you had to do in order to get them was play the game (a novel concept, I know). Hats were the only thing given to you as a random drop back then. I should probably point out that I took about a year break away from gaming at this point in time due to ""real life."" While I was away, the Mann-Conomy update happened. This update wasn't like any of the others, this update added tons of brand new weapons and hats, along with the addition of an in-game store and trading system to get them. When I eventually returned to TF2, the game wasn't about the objectives, or teamwork, or even being the best player anymore. All the game was about now was collecting the most hats and weapons you could get your hands on. The achievements didn't matter anymore because you could just buy whatever you wanted, or just find it as a random drop (since they updated it to more than just hats). The game that I fell in love with, spending sleepless nights for years, was all for nothing at the drop of a hat (quite literally). I'm not mad at Valve for what they did, from a business standpoint this is the smartest thing they've ever done. But whenever I see the game in my Steam library, I just get a deep feeling of nostalgia and longing for something that could have been. I hope that one day, I'll be able to relive those fond memories I have with Team Fortress 2.			"

												I wished I could reach the 1000 hours, maybe I will but apperantly Valve is trying everything to stop me from doing that. I've played this game for something like 3 years now. but last year when Valve tried to 'improve' Tf2 and the matchmaking system, they only made things worse. First there was the Gunmettle update where they introduced CSGO (Counter Strike Global Offensive) like skins that you could unbox. Nothing wrong with it right? Yeah I thought the same but instead of introducing new weapons and making the game more fun they came with a few more 'updates' introducing more and more weapon skins instead of the new weapons that everyone wanted. After the weaopn skins they began throwing with the same idea but with cosmetics. They are doing this to this day. On every mayor event like Christmas or Halloween they just dump more stupid cosmetics and useless taunts into the game. But thats not even the worst part. They completely destroyed the matchmaking system as I (we) knew it. In the beginning you could just go into server browser and join any server you liked. It was easy and very usefull because if you only had a few minutes to spare you could just join a server, play a few rounds and leave the server. Over the past six months though Valve introduced the 'improved matchmaking system' which meant that you were no longer able to choose your server the old fashioned way. instead you were dropped into a que like CSGO and had to wait for the game to put you into a match. A few thing about that: 1. The first few weeks after realease you had to wait like 15 minutes to be able to join a game. And you would probably in a team with 3 other players. So instead of 12v12 you got a 4v4, sometimes a  6v8 or a 6v10. 2. you could not choose your own maps in the first weeks after release so you were just hoping that you would be joining a game mode/map that you liked. 3. They added this levelling system where you gain exp by playing games. This destroyed the drop-in drop-out way of playiing completely and the fun pasrt is that to this date you get nothing for leveling up. No rewards, nothing. 4. they added competive play in Tf2 which had the same problems as casual mode, No servers so long waiting times. Ranking up still doesn't work. and people leaving the match where not penalized at all, at least not in a significant way. A few Weeks ago they released 'improved matchmaking' and the whole circus just starded all over again. the low match population, the unfair/unbalanced teams it is AGAIN back at the bottom of the pit.This version of Tf2 is just a shadow of it's former self. You should rally try the game but you shouldn't get attached to it because one day it might all be over with Team Fortress 2Thanks for reading Guys&GirlsYou can always add me if you have any questions			"

												""Would you recommend Team Fortress 2?"" Oh please, are you breathing? The answer is that obvious! Yes! I love it! Almost every aspect of it is perfect. What more can I ask for?- Free To Play> I don't have to add on, do I? It's wonderful. It creates the rainbows in the skies. It makes my unicorn fly. BAM!- Noob-Friendly> I started out as a gaming noob, barely knowing anything about Steam, or Team Fortress. My friend recommended Team Fortress 2 as my first tryout and I got hooked not long after. > They have a training mode to shape you up in and out, even an option to request a coach. 100% human plox. They offer amazing training grounds, offline practices... If you can't get a hang of Team Fortress 2 after playing it for a week, I'm judging you. Jokes! But it's really noob-friendly and I recommend this for first-time FPS players.> ""You'll get tired of your first ever game easily.""? False! I still play Team Fortress 2 and I'm loving it even more than when I just started out!- Sweet Graphics & Animation> Got a thing for realistic, not-too-gorey, and somewhat-cute graphics? Yo! This' the thing for you, bro! > As a first-time FPS player, promoting myself from Maplestory and being a scaredy-girl, I'm scared of extreme gore and blood. Team Fortress 2's graphics are awesome to me as there's just enough gore and blood, pretty much tolerable, and sometimes even funny! Also, if you're finding a FPS game with 100% no gore and blood... First off, I don't even think there's such a game. Secondly, you're not gonna have as much fun! *sad face* Lastly, it's an experience!- Various Types of Gameplay Plots (Maps)> From Payload Races to Capture The Flag, from Control Points to Mann VS Machine, there's probably as many plots as, or more than, the fingers on your hands!> Every plot has a different style of playing, strategies and players! If you're good at finding something, and probably have a good way of running away, Capture The Flag is for you! Hate computers and how smart they are? Or if you just want to rage at multiple objects which are stupider than you, Mann VS Machine is there for you to cast all your sorrows! > Team Fortress 2 gives us so many choices, it's hard to stick to one. It's like reading a book, you'll get bored if you keep reading the same story over and over again, but you still love the writing style of the writer. Thus, you read the other books by the same writer! Same logic!- Various Classes> As someone who just popped in and promoted from Maplestory, I like the idea of having my character suited for different situations. For example, although the Heavy is great at clearing maps, it gets annoying when a Sniper from the other team takes advantage of your slow movements and spam kills you. What do you do? Change to a Scout and crash that Sniper's brains!> Different classes are great at different maps, it complements the gameplay to the max!- Multiplayer Features> There's a chat system for you to communicate with your teammates -- by typing or speaking.> ""But people are so annoying!"" No worries, you can vote to mute, kick, and ban players on Team Fortress 2! Thank God for this. - Character Customization> The Mann Co. Catalog. Fanciful, huh?> You can get different hats and weapons to customize your characters, and make them the way you want them to be! Recommended for hipsters who are trying to escape the mainstream. To be honest, I feel more encouraged after I get a new look... Is it just me?- Market> You can buy, sell and trade for hats and weapons to customize your character. It gets irritating when you see someone having this awesome weapon you want, and yet you can't get the drop. There's the market for you -- buy it from the Mann Co. or the Steam Community Market. It isn't very expensive either, considering most of the items are roughly $0.99.> When you have no idea where the spend your Steam Wallet and want to train your business skills.- Teamwork> Let's get to the social part, shall we? Team Fortress, like its name, strengthens players' sense of teamwork. I'm pretty sure your parents or teachers screwed into your brain how important teamwork is, so I wouldn't get on that. > Example time! You're playing Control Points and there's an Engineer from your opponent's team that has been building sentry guns for forever. He's wiping out anyone who steps near the control point so you can't capture it. What do you do? Conspire with a Spy to sap the Engineer's sentry and have everyone else rush forward to capture the control point! Teamwork at it's best.- Community> The community is fun to be in, and I'll just say the developer has a great sense of humour. Just take a look at their YouTube channel! I've never laughed so hard at characters from an online game. If you've ever watched ""Meet The _____"", you'll realize that the classes have their own personalities and their own backgrounds! It's very entertaining to watch and laugh at.> Team Fortress 2 has a wonderful amount of artists, take a look at the fan art! Some are cute, some are gorey... All just plain Amazing with a capital A.> Don't know how to play? Good heavens, there are so many guides written by the professional players!> ♥♥♥♥♥I may have missed out one or two points, but you get my point. Team Fortress 2 is far more than amazing for a Free-To-Play game. So I'll say, ""9/10 will get it.""*gives developer a hug and kiss*			"

 About Team Fortress 2 Team Fortress 2 is a FPS game, developed by Valve, releasing in October 2007 on Steam, Xbox 360 and PC. You are probably going to see this review and think “Why are you reviewing TF2, everyone knows what it is about!” You will be right; however there is a small portion of people who have not ventured into TF2’s world, so this will be for you! It is my opinion for the game everyone has a different opinion ! :)GameplayFor Team Fortress 2 is based around various different game modes, which you take part in online servers. You join a team and choose one of nine different classes to play as. Some of the game modes include the classic capture the flag, control points, king of the hill, and payload – which requires you to move a cart across the map with a bomb attached to it, into the enemies base. The 9 different classes all feel very different to each other, but ultimately will fit into one of three roles; offense, defence and support. Offensive characters are the ones built for dealing large sums of damage to your foes. The defensive ones, whilst these also deal damage, are much more equipped for doing this from entrenched positions, and the support roles add different features to the team with healing or other special abilities which act as a benefit for your team, or a hindrance to the opponents. The classes are all really simple to learn how to use, but can be pretty tricky in mastering the art of the class. Grafik and SoundGraphically, since the game is running the Source engine, it looks gorgeous. The cartoony style of art on show gives the game a unique charm and feels which cannot be mimicked by any other game to date. Sound effects and sound tracks are all on point too.All in All Team Fortress 2 is a verry Good Game from Valve with the Source engine.10/10 Frome Me Sweep "

												The game itself is still fairly solid, but the majority of its playerbase is just so offensively, horribly bad that it makes actually playing it completely and utterly unfun. Matchmaking was SUPPOSED to fix this, but it lacks any sort of placement matches. This has resulted in me, a player with over 3300 hours who has been playing since the Pyro update in 2008, consistently being matched with squeaker, 3rd-world, 6 year olds with toasters for computers who have been playing for 20 minutes. And there's no way I can escape them. I think, even if there is a future update that fixes this, this here whale is done with TF2 simply because it's just been more frustrating than fun, and it's burnt me out for good.Unless you are one of said 6 year olds (in which case, go for your life, you cancerous little cyst), I can not recommend this game anyone anymore.

												Ah, TF2, one of the most well-known and popular FPS games out there on Steam, especially since it became Free To Play on the Steam Store.  Ever since a friend got me into this game, I've been playing it non-stop for more than 200 play hours in total, and I would like to take the time to give my own thoughts on the game as a whole and some tips for newcomers to help them on their way to enjoy the game and not ragequit within the first 20 minutes of jumping right into it.First off, gameplay-wise the game is a typical multiplayer-based FPS game where the core goal is very simplistic: Hop on either the red or blue team and kill the opposing team and secure victory, however, the methods of accomplishing this range per match type, and usually good teamwork and class diversity are required to win the match. As for said class diversity, the game offers you 9 different playable class characters to choose from, all with their unique advantages and disadvantages, and it's a key requirement for any player to learn the limits and strengths of those classes in order to play the class effectively and to be of benefit to your team as a whole. Thankfully the game has a alright tutorial on a few classes, specifically the Demoman, Spy, Engineer and Soldier, but there are many tricks for a class that the game doesn't often directly tell you, but rather clues you in through the in-game loading screen tips section when you go to a match. Picking a class that suits your playstyle is often the first thing many new players struggle with, but the classes all range from fairly easy to pick up and play decently with, to far more tricky and fragile ones that require the player to be familiar with the mechanics and overall gameplay before they can effectively use them in combat. Such examples are the Heavy, Soldier and Pyro which in my opinion are some of the more easily accessable classes for new players to experiment around with, and Engineer, Sniper and Spy for the more experienced players when they feel confident enough. It has something for every kind of FPS gamer regardless of skill level, which is what I really like about this game.Atmosphere-wise, the game is very visually pleasing with alot of intricate map design accomodating the various matchtypes, and is designed so that players who are unfamiliar with the map and it's pathways are given visual cues on where to go, like if they're on the red team, a red arrow sign will point in the general direction where they need to head to, as well as various signs detailing a mission's objective and locations, like 'Intelligence' for the intel briefcase on capture the flag, 'Battlements' for the general middle area where most of the combat will take place, etc. The classes all have dynamic personalities that make them a blast to play as and you'll often chuckle at their lines regarding the situation, which really gives this game alot of personality. I personally really enjoy the Pyro because the character itself wears a gas mask which makes most of his lines almost inaudiable, but if you listen carefully you can make out a few key lines that he screams out.Besides the game's addictive core gameplay, there's alot of side content to it like customizable loadouts to your class' arsenal, cosmetic clothing and different taunts which you usually have to acquire through specific unlocking methods, crafting from metal which you get from turning additional weapons into metal which you obtain from random weapon drops during gameplay or trading with other players. Trading is one of the key mechanics of interacting with other players, and interacting with other players is oftentimes a good way of getting to meet a nice friend on Steam wether it's someone on your team, or someone you encounter while on a specific trade server, and who might be able to trade or even gift you some stuff if you're friendly to the player and and he/she is friendly to you in return. Just be careful of annoying or pushy players who are out for your items and will offer either nothing or nearly worthless items in return, though, if you happen to encounter those, just ignore them.There is also a Mann vs. Machine co-op game mode in where you get to work together with 5 other players being the limit against a horde of powerful robots trying to defend your area from a bomb they will attempt to deliver at all costs. This game mode is much more intense than regular multiplayer TF2 and you can earn nice cosmetic item rewards for your weapons in the Mann Up mode, but the Bootcamp mode is free to play and a good way for practice, but Mann vs. Machine is very tough and is not recommended for newcomers of TF2 to try out immediately.With that all out of the way, here are a few tips I would recommend everybody who's going to try this game out to follow if they want to have a pleasant experience playing this game in the long run:- Always stay friendly to other players and don't act obnoxious or self-righteous to others.  The name of the game is TEAM Fortress 2, meaning that in order to win, you need to work together as a team, and not go out there, thinking you can take the entire team on yourself, which will oftentimes lead to you getting killed over and over again. Communicate with your fellow team members over the situation and what you're planning to do, or regarding  plans or tactics that the enemy team is using through the default Y normal in-game chat and U team members-only chat window buttons. Your team members will appreciate it if you're friendly, and will be much more likely to co-operate alongside with you towards completing the objective if you do so. Sure the game can get very hectic and is easy to get annoyed over a supposed 'cheap kill' from a enemy player, but overall try to maintain a friendly atmosphere in the game.- If nessecary, do offline training on maps that you're unfamiliar with, and explore the maps so you'll know the shortcuts and side routes into enemy territory. This is a key factor into becoming a more skilled player over time, as there are many side routes that are often easy to miss or not pay attention to that the developers of the maps implemented in order to balance the game and make it possible for a team to overcome the other if they're being pressured or having difficulty breaking through chokepoints. If the enemy team is spawncamping, try to take a different spawn exit and flank them from behind. If the main route into their base is heavily guarded, look for a alternate pathway to take and inform your teammates about it. - Play classes that suit the current situation. This is a common mistake that I see occuring alot on many servers I play on, as quite alot of players seem to not grasp the limits of a class and oftentimes like to stick to one class only just because they like playing as that certain class and refuse to play anything else that the team might benefit more at that specific point during the match. Players need to observe the situation and pick classes whose advantages are required at the time. To give a good example, payload is a match type in where the red team needs to defend the bomb from being delivered by the blue team, and as such will be spawn-camping right off the bat during the start of the match. Yet alot of times there tend to be about 2 or 3 Spy and/or Sniper players in a team of roughly 9 to 12 players on blue. Those 2 classes can only take out 1 enemy at a time normally, and will be killed easily. You'll need a strong offensive class like Heavy or Soldier to pressure and kill the enemy team, and if your team doesn't have a Medic, be one. Medic isn't a easy class, but your team members will benefit from the healing so they won't have to retreat to the supply closet often. Class diversity and good communication about class choices mid-game can go a long way in winning the match.Thanks for reading this, and hope it was insightful. I definetely recommend this game!			"

												I've played this game for 4.4k hours, and I absolutely love it. People may claim that it's dying and that it's bad, but it's really not that. The game has characters with personalities, very lovable ones at that, and is overall amazing. Takes a bit of skill varying on what class you take on. There's really not much else to say. Once you get the game, it all becomes clear.			"

												A lot of the fun that I used to have with TF2 was casually joining a friend's game in a pub, be on their side, or comically kill them with a crocket on their opposite team like a prank.No I don't hate the game, I still find it enjoyable.But I'd rather do other stuff than level up a badge and be in a queue for ages nonstop.Things got too tryhard-y, I wonder if there's other games for that laid back feel of the sillyness that I used to love of TF2.

												Team Fortress 2 is a first-person shooter game from Valve.The gameplay is somewhat similar to Counter-Strike but with more variety of game modes, class based player, and unlike Counter-Strike, in terms of gameplay this game is more casual rather than competitive, at least for me. Everyone can play it, from kids, teens to parents, everyone can play. The game is very well balanced, each class has more than one unique abilities you can explore. You can get item drops as you play, and the more play, the more you can get. Items can be crafted for another better items too, or trade them for other items. And the best thing about his game is hats! Yes, hats. Most every damn people here on Steam loves them. You can show off your hats, craft it or even sell them! Many people make profit from it, many people collect it.Team Fortress 2 graphics is 3D but with cartoon style. Even though the graphics is cartoon, Team Fortress 2 still feature blood and gore effects. All effect from explosion, weapons fire, rockets, everything are cartoonized.This is great free to play game for me, I highly recommend it. Play it now!Rating 9/10			"

												Valve ruined one of the  best,if not the best class-based FPS with a poorly executed,overhyped,unpolished update.For years,Team Fortress 2 has survived  many disgraceful updates that gave the community the feeling that VALVE wants to transform TF2  from  a very exciting and  thrilling FPS with a diverse cast of playstyles and characters into a platform for selling crates,cosmetics and skins.               *CASUAL*   This update killed QUICKPLAY and the actual casual mode,and replaced it with a ranked semi-competitive mode for tryhards to sweat thier b*lls at.The current state of casual is better now after VALVE realised that  players want the freedom of choosing the map they want to play and the gamemode they want to enjoy.In its first version the new ""CASUAL"" mode punished players for leaving a  CASUAL match which doesn't make any sense since CASUAL ,by nature is something you want to enjoy without any punishment.Now that this horrible feature has been swept under the rug,the  actual ""CASUAL"" is better now.The long queing times were another reason that made this gamemode a steaming pile of poo,beacuse they made the game quiet impossible to play. On release I experienced a 30 minute search time,after sitting my ♥♥♥ reading the patch notes for those 30 minutes,facepalming all the way, I got into the game and I got to play 5 minutes until the match ended.This kind of nonsense made alot of the players to quit the game.Now the que times have been improved to ~5-10 minutes,but its still ludicrous considering the fact that before MYM you could easily get into a game on a map that you enjoy,playing the gamemode you love in less than a minute.So if I would make the statements above shorter in patch-note format it would look like this:""-Amplified  the queing time beacuse using the QUICKPLAY interface was too confusing for new players"".The long queue times on their own makes the CASUAL mode not worth the time,but the rest of the issues that i mentioned are just the icing on the cake           *COMPETITIVE*The cover star for the update,the competitive is an overhyped feature that TF2 needed since launch.The actual system is  basic with nothing deep to it.TF2center's competitive setup is deeper and the guys that are working on that site actually give a damn about competitive.This new mode  its just a  dumbed down 6s game that you might have experienced if you used TF2center.There are no whitelists of class and weapon bans in this set up so you can rock 4 heavies 2 meds easily and crush the opponent.Your average competitive experience can be summed up in the following matter.You join,if you are on the point of losing a match,a player  in your team will disconnect and you can all leave in peace without any punishment,however if you win, most of the time you will steam-roll the other team because they may lack the communication or synergy requiered to win a match.The intense matches are rare and they can be great fun on both sides .Overall the matchmaking system implemented represented a small portion of what the community really wanted and a huge number of head-scratching choices made by the dev team       *WEAPON BALANCING*Valve empolyees don't play the game.Short and simple.They break the balance constantly and they p*ss many community members off by nerfing good weapons that the community enjoys.A good example is the Phlog,Loch n' Load disaster that made the community  ask VALVE's sanity when they decided to buff them.Speaking about the current balancing:they buffed some underused weapons that nobody will use ever,they created the scout pocket meta by buffing the medic's speed while healing the scout(You should read the weapon balances if you want a good laugh).In my honest opinion VALVE should communicate with us and let us know what they are up to so we can give some constructive criticism.      For me TF2 was the best fun you can have online.It had and it still has a very addicting gameplay with a unique artstyle,character roster  and unique weapond designs.Unfortunately now its a  cosmetic selling platform that is dying update by update.      Rest in peace TF2, one day I would love to see you young again.....			"

tl;dr Quirky shooter that shows its age but is still charming and tons of fun, though recent updates are lacklustre.Consider the following: If a game still has a large and active fanbase after nine years, it must be doing something right. That's what Team Fortress 2 is doing; it's been out for a staggering nine years, and there are still many loyal fans. What is it doing that lets it live for this long?Before we talk about that however, let's talk about TF2's gameplay. Compared to other shooters, it's quite bizarre--no sprinting, no aiming down sights (there is scoping for sniper rifles), no accuracy bonus for crouching, and no accuracy penalties for running or jumping. It's a jarring transition if you're used to COD or CS:GO, or vice-versa--like me, but it creates an incredibly fast-paced game where it's more about dodging and being unpredictable than accuracy. There are 9 classes: The Scout, offering the fastest base movement speed and a double jump; the Soldier, an incredibly versatile unit who can trade health for speed with rocket jumping; the Pyro, a ""utility assault"" who can disrupt enemies with fire and keep teammates safe by extinguishing fires and reflecting projectiles; the Demoman, a versatile unit with the highest sheer damage output in the game; the Heavy, a tank who can shred enemies at close range in a mere second; the Engineer, a utility class who can rush allies to the front lines with teleporters and lock down entire areas with sentry guns; the Medic, the most important class with the power to break stalls with Ubercharge; the Sniper, the most powerful pick class who can take the sting out of enemy pushes by eliminating key targets; and the Spy, who can disguise and cloak to get around enemies and backstab them for a one-hit kill. Every class is unique, with their own upsides and downsides; compared to Overwatch however, it's not as much of a game of rock-paper-scissors. While some classes counter others--Engineers and their buildings are vulnerable to Spies, while a puff of flame can nullify a Spy's stealth devices--some things are not set in stone. If you want to ♥♥♥♥ off the enemy team, you can just run half-Pyro, half-Engineer, and nothing short of the enemy team using nothing but Medics and assault to nuke your fortifications can stop it. All in all though, it's a lot of fun.Now, how has TF2 stayed so fresh after nine years? Updates. The game has received a whopping 575 patches since its launch; 37 of those were major content updates that added new items and maps to the game. All these updates mean that there's always new things to play, and new ways to play. It's customary for me to check in on TF2 when a new major update hits. However, as of late, TF2's updates have been taking a rather bizarre turn, and sadly for the worse. Sure, adding weapon skins was cool--I think they're awesome, and the stock weapons looked boring to me anyway--but it's been a year and a half since any weapons were added that actually had unique stats. It's an incredibly sore spot for TF2 fans that it's been this long since a new weapon was added to shake things up; while the TF team has promised that new weapons are to come for the Pyro after the Pyro vs Heavy War, that means we have to wait even more--not helped by an overall lack of transparency meaning we have no idea when this update will actually come. This new direction TF2 is heading, combined with the TF team often being eerily silent when it comes to fan outcry, causes unnecessary paranoia and negativity, which can be resolved quite easily.Of course, being a nine-year-old game based on the dated Source engine, TF2 is also full of bugs. Some are good, some are bad, and some are just plain awful. It's as if with every map launched, tons of ""leaving-the-map exploits"" are found and for a short while you get killed by sentries you can't see or attack. The TF team fixes these...reasonably fast...but sometimes it takes months for something to happen. If you're looking for a bug-free experience, it's definitely not here.All in all, Team Fortress 2 will leave behind quite the legacy when it finally falls, but I hope it still has a good few years left in it--at least enough for a Team Fortress 3 to arrive. Whether it'll last long enough will depend on how well the TF team can work with their dedicated player base, and sadly, it can't be hidden that so far it's looking bad. Regardless, if you're looking to try a different FPS experience and want to have some casual fun, TF2 is a great choice.			"

												I don't really feel it is necessary to talk about what's good about TF2 on a wide basis, because we all know what is good about it. It's updated from time to time, it doesn't feel abandoned like most multiplayers and it has a large pool of creative fans. Plus custom game mods like Slender Fortress, Freak Fortress and Death Run make the game twice as better. So I'll just point out the negatives.Explosive spam. It is understood in a 30 player server that spam is existant and will forever stay that way. Kudos Short Circuit. It was fun while it lasted.Crutch weapons/shields and overall annoyance. Black Box/Concheror. Darwin's Shield. Reserve Shooter. Beggar's Bazooka. Vaccinator pairs. Degreaser combos. Despite naming these, I bet all of us use them anyway. So I guess you should all feel horrible about yourselves.Mini-sentries. It sets up in less than 3 seconds. The engineer has the ability to pick up his gear; why not force him to ulitize a push with his teammates instead? It's a server killer. When you're on a team that doesn't feel like destroying them constantly, it's dead.Melee system. You may run into some issues with hit registration not going your way, like hearing your melee weapon make it's hit sound, but no actual registration. Pocket medics. This can go both ways and it's understandable to heal just that one power class that's getting most of the dirty work done. We get it. But what you don't get is that you're gaining much assistance as well from the rest of your teammates that is providing much said and needed push. Do the team a favour. Heal everyone (at least those who respect you). People not understanding the difference between Boot Camp and Mann Up mode.The essence of Mann Up mode is to use the most effective loadouts, have a organized team of each class and to get through wave by wave. If you want to mess around, there is Boot Camp.Lag compensation. This takes the cake. Shots will seem off and you'll most definitely have those moments where you either got sniped through a wall or railed through the wall by the Heavy's curving mini-gun bullets. You thought you got past that wall, but you didn't on their screen. Seeing as I play Scout, it's something I notice on a daily basis, specifically against heavies. It's just all lag compensation. Curious to know more about it, I recommend googling it.Critical hits. It's either you get lucky or outlucked. If it's a issue for players, you'll have to search for those servers that host non-crit settings as the known popular public servers don't. There can be humor in it, but not when it's so frequent. Either way, critical hits are random pokes of not fun and it ruin the results of good matches.Servers not tolerating class balance. Not everyone wants to play in a server infested with engineers and mini-sentries/sentries all over the place. Or more than 2-3 demomen spamming stickies everywhere. Whatever the scenario is, this slides right into lack of teamwork and coordination. Things may never get done the right way, so your best bet is to probably just find another server. Try to get a fair team scramble going and all of the average to good players may quickly go to spectator mode to restack again. We are no angels to that. Who doesn't want to be on the better team?Closing comments...Although all of that is what's to dislike about TF2, you'll somehow just find a way to see pass through it all and enjoy the game for what it is. Make some friends, find a favorite server and avoid the awful memes if you can.			"

												Currently the game is AWFUL. It lost everything that used to make it any level of good and has now been replaced with things that make it total garbage and not worth playing, at all. Quickplay is gone. It's been replaced with some god-awful replacement called Casual. It's boring and doesn't have the feeling of randomness and surprise that the old pubs used to have. Dosn't help that the Queue times are god awful as well. I managed to watch 3 entire ""SGBPlay Mario Party"" videos, which are about 1:30 hours long each, before entering a single match of Badwater that lasted about 10 minutes. And in those 10 minutes, it wasn't fun because instead of having the old people on pubs like the mic spammers who would be entertaining if they did things like put music or do impressions of Morgan Freeman, or the team Hoovy/SpyCrab who you could walk up to, have a sandvich with and maybe even conga for a few minutes, now you get a team of tryharding idiots who can't take a joke for the life of them. Hell, even the LENNY/BIND spammers are gone. This simple move has taken all the character and charm TF2 had and ♥♥♥♥ all over it.Next is the balancing. This game has HORRIBLE balancing. Especially since VALVe doesn't communicate with the community to tell them what was coming up, or take jokes people say too seriously or what they seem to enjoy doing. Only listening to the competitive players. People like B4nny and Mr.Slin, while awesome people, were the only ones who have their opinions heard by VALVe, and to what has that opinion led? Phlog Buff of Smissmass 2015 and Caber Nerf of Summer 2015. Two weapons that were perfectly fine, especially the caber which was basically a suicide weapon and after the initial explosion did a fragment of the bottles damage, and the Phlog became the ""Walk and Die"" weapon of the century. This update has brought unwanted/unneeded changes. Come on, who was complaining about the Buffalo Steak Sandvich!? WHO COMPLAINED ENOUGH TO SAY IT NEEDED A NERF!? Next is the communication. VALVe communicating with the community, WHAT A PIPEDREAM. They never tell us what's coming up for incoming updates. At most we get the ocassional ""Neato"" in the sub-reddit. And why you might ask? Because the TF team is 5 people who don't care/give a ♥♥♥♥ about their own game. Overwatch was released, one would expect VALVe to raise their guard, their standards and so on, no, all they do is give us a half baked update with ""Heavy VS Pyro"", which feels like an excuse to not give us a full update from the getgo and stall about a month more out of us for the update. If VALVe simply asked what we wanted and said that the update was gonna take longer than expected, we would understand. Most of the TF community would be happy knowing that VALVe didn't abandon us, and is working on the game, meanwhile adding the voting system to the game to see which class people wanted to see more get the update. And finally, my biggest gripe with TF2 currently, it's more personal and I know I'll get ridicule over it, but the lack of MAC support. I run TF2 on MAC, which some might call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but at least I run TF2 at 230 FPS. Well WOULD run it. The game is in such a state where the MAC support died off about 3 months ago. The game constantly crashes with the error ""Out of memory"" or because the game failed to load a single texture. Not to mention the game loads textures ONE AT A TIME. For MAC users, the first hour is a struggle seeing how long the computer takes through freeze frames, lag and so on while it painfully loads every graphic one at a time. So for the most time, you're in a server with all the graphics either blurry or missing while they load in, which has taken me upward to 3 hours on 2Fort alone. Also, the game freezes in the menu, in game or, most commonly, in the ""Retriving Server Info"" part of the loading screen. I'm not sure if windows/Linux also have these issues, but every glitch causes the MAC to crash in some way or another. There's even been instances where my entire computer, not just TF2, but all of it crashed due to TF2 failing to load me in. The last true patch MAC ever got was about 1 year ago in gun mettle, where VALVe did some fixes to help with crashes caused by the update. Also, anybody on windows/linux mind telling me if the game also runs like that on their computers? This is a TF2 only issue, GMod runs fine, CS:GO runs fine, but TF2 doesn't. The game used to be great, but the currently influx of bad updates, bugs, glitches and crashes completly destroyed a game that used to be great. Doesn't even feel VALVe is the one making the game anymore. It feels like EA or god-fobid Ubisoft took the wheel with this game.			"

												I used to love the game but since the new menu interface and the fact that you can't join a specific gamemode anymore ( You have to atleast select two gamemodes to join). Also, if you want to wait 20 - 40 minutes just to join one game that will end in 5 - 15 minutes. There trying so hard to keep up with Overwatch that they ruined the game. That being said, I do like the new player list that shows the type of players that are on your team at the top of the screen in game though.			"

												So ask me even a year ago if you asked me if you should play TF2, I'd reply ""Wait, I haven't already told you to play?""Now, the answer is a solid ""No.""I can forgive stupid balance changes, the additions of several unfinished and abandoned features, an obnoxious obsession with cosmetics and a community as toxic as they come, because hey, it's Valve's sandbox where they test the features to put into their more successful multiplayer titles.But I'm not writing a review for any reason other than it is now effectively impossible to have a quick, fun casual experience. I'll admit that even after formally ""quitting,"" I'd still take some time to play a short pub game on a Valve supported server every so often. Now though I can't even do that.Like having to wait in a queue for a game when you previously didn't? Like being penalized if you get called away and can't finish your match? Like an obnoxiously low FOV that makes your eyes strain? Like having no other option than to join some teenager's plugin filled nightmare of a community server? Then hey, this is the update for you.Also, the idea of having the only two options for being able to play a competitive game be ""Give us ten bucks"" or ""Give us your phone number"" is disgusting, and the kind of thing I'd expect from a lesser company like EA. Grow up, Valve, you're doing way more damage then Overwatch ever could.			"

												I own more hats and cosmetic items in this game than I own clothes in real life.After 2,000 hours spent blowing people up, setting people on fire, beating people to death with my bare fists, pushing a large explosive device in a mining cart along a track, trading hats for pieces of metal, and being riddled with bullets by a heat-seeking automatic turret- I think it's safe to say Team Fortress 2 is a pretty fun game.Never gets old, fun to team up, or even duel your friends, and there's always more content around the corner.Free-to-Play, it'll give you a good laugh at times, and other times make you want to throw your monitor out the window in blind, crimson rage.

												Back then it was the coolest game ever, with fantastic character design and art direction, fun and balanced gameplay. I had so, SO MUCH FUN!Cool server mods, awesome community, lots of depth, and a lot of servers actually tolerated micspamming music and dank maymays!Now it's age and evolution have destroyed every bit of enjoyment you can get out of it.Cheaters are all over the place, grouping up with alt accounts manned by bots, using spinbots, clearing server chat at every frame and namespoofing other players in order to get them unjustly kicked or banned.The matchmaking system put community servers in a chokehold. Now all there is left are 12v12 ""matchmade"" casuals ridden with cheaters, premium community servers with pay2win plugins that give actual cheats to whale players, servers filled with cancerous mods and plugins and manned by power-hungry moderators/admins (a surprisingly high amount of them being kids) who ban randoms for whimsical reasons and have a tendency to abuse their powers.The art direction got completely ruined by cosmetics. What used to be an insane, warmongering, badass soldier now wears pink, flaming rabbit ears, a pink santa beard, a spartan hat and a golden rocket launcher with christmas lights around it... And can also ride a magical broom... Oh dear.The crazy amount of unoptimized meshes added by playermodel cosmetics gave a lot of weight to the game files and made tf2 run no more on older machines which used to run it flawlessly.Even after so many years the game's overall gameplay hasn't changed that much. Random crits are still there (unless competitive play, for which you have either to authenticate yourself with a phone (no thanks), or pay (even if you have bought the game when it wasn't f2p ... ♥♥♥♥ move.) Also note that this was done in order to prevent an influx of cheaters and smurf accounts. Needless to say it didn't help at all).The game is still oriented towards zoning, making explosives so powerful that the only mechanic that manages to really shake a game is the medic's übercharge. It now mostly boils down to ""spam a choke point, wait for medic uber, attack, rinse and repeat"". Casuals are a blind spamfest (12v12 in rather small maps, which is way too many players) where tf2's long respawn times kill your enjoyment. Competitive is much better though.MvM is tons of fun for a while, then quickly gets boring.And let's just not talk about class balance.TF2 was the best damn game I had played for a long time. It's first big updates were steps in the good direction, but valve suddenly caved in to greed and added a cash shop and trading, which started the game's downfall...			"

												A game that will not only get you addicted to hats, but also hyped up about bread!The goal in this first-person shooter multiplayer video game is to choose a team (RED/BLU) and beat the other team in 8 different official game modes (king of the hill, capture-the-flag, push-little-cart…). Inside a team you can select one of nine classes with each class having its strength and weaknesses which guarantees there’ll be a game style that fits you. You can also play co-op where you team up with six other people to kill robots who came to attack the 'Mann.co Store'. Besides these official game types there are many others created by the community such as a medieval, prophunt,..If you ever get bored with playing, which is unlikely but it can happen after more than 2.000 hours, then you can always start collecting hats by trading, reason why it’s often referred to as the number one hat-simulator.Before this game I wouldn’t even have considered playing any cartoon-like games. But I’m glad someone converted me. It’s a game that's filled with humor and will not get you bored easily. More importantly, it’s free, why shouldn’t you give it a try at least?But the biggest advantage of all is that this is a very social game which you can play with friends. And for the people who don't have any friends: with this game you'll sure get some!Even if this game has been out there for a while, it’s still being updated on a regular basis. New game modes and hats created by the developers and community are regularly being pushed forward and major events are happening at Halloween, Christmas and Easter.There is only one downside I can think of: it’s quite large in size. So make sure you have enough disk space.			"

												Valve have systematically destroyed everything that made TF2 fun.They opened the floodgates to bratty little smartarses on their big brother's hand-me-down PC or school laptop when they took a game with modest system requirements and made it free. The player community has since degenerated in to smack-talk and reciting memes stolen from ♥♥♥♥♥, which is a far cry from the game where Internet Tough Guys used to be told to '♥♥♥♥ off back to xbox live' and were promptly kicked. They also made it impossible to punish hackers by making the game free; a VAC ban just results in them opening a new account.They encouraged poor form with weapons and 'killstreak kits' that incentivised playing like a tryhard (often at the expense of your own team and the objective).They've provided the bare minimum in terms of support since their newer games started making bank. When balance changes come, they come with the most superficial understanding of gameplay dynamics and typically come with a six-months-to-forever wait for fixes to their fixes; they even admitted in a blog post that they simply nerf whatever is popular and buff whatever goes unused. They've straight-up declined to take any role in managing the in-game economy since adding a single new metal sink mechanic about three years ago, meaning players without a lot of disposable income are SOL when it comes to exchanging metal for keys or other goods. We're also now lucky if we get a single non-annual, non-community-developed content update a year - and even then, they're usually paid grind-fests for a bunch of reskinned guns.They made netcode changes a few years back, allowing servers more control over client variables, which most community server operators have never managed to use constructively. To this day, most community-run servers play like crap (even when they're not running obnoxious mods). This wasn't so bad when Valve began running vanilla pub servers but they've since taken those away, too.And now they're trying to turn a very dated game about silly hats and dance parties, with a playerbase who largely appreciated TF2 because it isn't Counter Strike or DOTA2 and wasn't trying to be, in to some 'esports' abomination. Even their 'casual mode', our supposed replacement for Valve pubs, has a giant lifetime kill/death counter displayed across the screen, attracting entirely the wrong sort and priorities in what was supposed to be an objective- and team-focused game. Never mind that their matchmaking system is next to useless if you feel like playing a couple of specific maps; you're either waiting for forever to get on your maps or you select every map and repeatedly end up on Turbine (albeit, pretty quickly) or you use the server browser to find one of the aforementioned terrible community servers.It's great the Valve supported a game for as long as they did but, at this point, I suspect no stewardship at all would be less destructive than the half-arsed support the game receives now. What made TF2 special and what that one intern at Valve wants TF2 to be are two very different things.			"

This game is free and yet it is one of the most popular games on Steam. 
That says something.I definitely recommend playing TF2 or at least trying it out. However, I believe that to fully enjoy this game, you cannot play for a short period of time. My reason for this belief is that when I first started playing TF2, I played for around an hour and didn't really like it. However, I decided to try playing again around a month after my first try, and I slowly began to enjoy it. Over time, I began to understand how to play as each of the characters, and unlocked many game-changing items. TF2 is fairly easy to play once you get used to it, but when you first start playing, it's like entering a whole new world. TF2 is unlike any other game and it will take a bit of time to fully understand it, but once you do, it becomes one amazingly fun multiplayer game.			"

												Game was absolutely ruined by the new update that eliminated casual play. I only have a small window of time to play video games and don't want to wait 10 - 30 minutes to join a match between rounds. I have yet to be able to join a casual match since the update, actually. There was no reason to get rid of quick play in order to add matchmaking. Why completely redesign how your players experience a trusted product when competitors like Overwatch are spending so much to entice your user base away?Anyone who doesn't get why this sucks, let me ask you something. Do you use Netflix? Imagine if you couldn't watch a new episode unless 23 other people in your area joined you. And then if you wanted to change the channel you would have to wait 10 minutes between videos. Does that sound like something you would spend money on? No. And before you cry ""FREE TO PLAY"", you are missing the glaringly obvious reason why they went free to play to play in the first place: to increase microtransaction purchases. While I did happen to buy the game before it went free to play, I have also spent my fair share on the marketplace and in the shop. No more. Not so much out of spite but because there's no point in spending money on a game I. CAN'T. PLAY.For a game that is almost 10 years old, I'm surprised that you, Valve, would choose NOW to tell such a thriving portion of your users to go @#$% themselves with unapologetic, casual laziness. The only rational explanation for this is that you are trying to drive your users to a more profitable product, perhaps CSGO. Because otherwise I can't imagine why you would risk scrubbing such a popular gamemode in the face of the first formiddable competition that has popped up for TF2 in a long time.Someone at Valve gave you some really bad advice about risk taking. Stop trying to salvage it by making shoddy half-@#$ concessions; listen to your user base. You have a small window of opportunity to FIX THIS and reclaim the users that actually spend money on the game. Soon they will lose interest and move on. Competitive gamemodes do not attract casual users, and competitive players do not spend money on microtransactions. Experienced, competitive players do their trading on private servers between players, meaning no profit is going to Valve. Casual players don't have the time or expertise to put serious work into trade servers and so they spend money on the marketplace instead. So valve, unless your goal is to tank TF2's profitability, I hope you will consider getting rid of the obstacles that discourage casual players, such as penalties for casual playing but most importantly, get rid of the lobbies and let us go back to playing the game we loved.

												Problems with Tf2 now:-Malicious players rarely recieve bans, and can still greif servers with no problem-Competitive has a multitude of bugs, such as not recieving the correct amount of XP, DE-RANKING if earning a large amount of XP, not losing XP after disconnect, and not even trying to match you with people of similar ranks-Casual games are usually barely over 7-10 minutes; cue times are about 5-8 minutes, and you need to re-que once a game ends-Valve has little to no communication with the majority player-base-Valve takes all feedback from a competitive mindset-Valve practically has no play-testers for new updates-Servers have tendancies to lag or just have shoddy connection, or be far from your location-There is no longer a quickplay option-Few weapons which actually needed balancing, got balanced-Most weapon fixxes were unnecessary or ridiculous-The Third Degree remains the only stock upgrade, somehow-Casual games usually end right as you join them-Competitive can be accessed by a barely working phone link system, or you shell out cash-Community servers are commonly plagued with ads, plugins, horribly moderated games, abusive administrators, or just Tf2, but done wrong-The Server Browser is innefective at finding ideal servers, as it has not been updated at all to acomidate to the traffic brought by the removal of pubs-The server browser is the same one from Half Life, a game from OVER 20 YEARS AGO-Valve does not test these updates before shipping them out, these contain bugs, exploits, or missing features-Valve has been slow at fixing errors-Overral, the game sucks nowNotes on this subject:-Pubs are STILL absent, even after massive backlash-The recent reviews section of the Tf2 store front has gone from Extremely Positive, to Mixed, within a MONTH. [Keep posting negative reviews, we need to get this through Valve's thick skull, make the 'Mixed' go to Negative!] It's gone to Very Positive. Just as an update..The Few Decent Changes: -Competitive, while in a broken state, IS in the game-Casual would have been fine if added along-SIDE pubs-If your game crashes or you time out, upon loading the game, it asks you if you'd like to reconnect to the server you were onExtra Notes: -The argument, just join a good community server, is incredibely stupid. There are only about some several hundred servers that are ad free, plugin free, and have good admins, and most have a server capacity of 24, the player count is in the thousands! Tens! Hundreds!-The argument of 'Valve is fixing it' is also stupid, it is not fixed, Valve will likely take months to fix this. [They've fixed most of the errors, but some major ones are still present]-Some assume that once Valve fixxes Tf2 by adding back pubs, it'll become sunshine and rainbows again. Wrong. Valve still has the potential to release an update just as bad, or even worse than Mym, it's likely that the community would be better off if Valve handed over most of the development to the community. [Likely, the hate will be so strong, that the negative reviews and player number drops will continue, even after pubs were added back]-The argument of 'Why are you complaining, just accept it, you're being ungrateful', ungrateful, we should be grateful for a sh`it update, poor treatment of a formerly great game, and lack of communication between Valve and the community? Fu`ck NO.How good were the updates I experienced [My opinion]:Love and War: Pretty good, however I found the new weapons when they came out were a bit underwhelming.End of the Line: Extremelly dissapointing, this was an overhyped, rushed mess. Having only some cosmetics, a weapon reskin, a map that got CUT! And was based on a pretty meh SFM.Gun Mettle: Ehh, the Tf:Go thing was very offputting, it felt wrong in Tf2. A bunch of weapons got dumb changes *Scorch Shot I'm looking at you*, but some were necessary *The Loch N' Load nutering was not necessary though*Invasion: Almost exactly like EOTL, cosmetics, a bunch of weapon reskins, a few neat maps, a reskin of a map, and some crates...yay?Tough Break: Worse than Gun Mettle, brought back the Tf:Go thing, introduced stupid weapon changes.. *R.I.P Charge N' Targe* *Phlog...is satan*. And generally, was not good.Scream Fortress 2015: So dissapointing, reskinned contracts 'merassmisions', bland cosmetics, bland game modes, reskinning sd_doomsday for no reason at all, no one plays that; and added some generic taunts.Meet your Match: Atrocious, Valve could not do worse at execution of an update: LOOK UP FOR INFO.Scream Fortress 2016: Look down bellow for my ♥♥♥♥♥ing about this mediocre...thing.Future Update Opinions:-I believe that the Pyro update coming...whenever... will give us some unbalanced flamethrowers, reskins, more flare guns [Cause we need more! Flare 4 Shotgun 2], dumb changes, and misc. dumb additions-I believe Scream Fortress 2016 will also be dissapointing, maybe reskin cp_degrootkeep, or tc_hydro, dumb cosmetics, and boring game modes.[UPDATE] Scream Fortress 2016 is somewhat what I expected:-Bland cosmetics-Uninspired crate system-No new content-A ♥♥♥♥ing game break for Macs when it came out-Broken Merrasmisions-A few neat maps, too bad one is for pd...you even play that?-The next big update will likely be just as damaging as Mym, or just as bland as EOTL			"

												You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.I hate to admit it but the game defeated me.I used to not give a f*** about hats, killstreaks or expensive items in general.Then I traded my first hat, my first rare item. As time went, I desired more and more and more. Suddenly, it was not about playing but collecting pixels. The game got me. The joy was replaced with greed. I had to pull the plug. I had to escape.

												I used to love this game......But that was before the plague hit.And with plague I mean the ridiculous meet your match update that forced 99% of community server owners to shut down their servers for good, and forced everybody to go full tryhard, sucking all the silly fun out of the game.Stuff like jumping across the map and suicide bombing snipers with the caber are mere memories now.And don't get me started on the hackers. As of the meet your match update, I'm yet to find a match where there isn't atleast 1 guy using lm@obox spinhax. This, paired with all the people whom are protective of said cheaters (I recently got kicked for literally pointing out that there was a spy with infinite cloak duration and backstabbing people while invisible, which was 100% true mind you) makes for the perfect cancer milkshake.Trust a TF2 veteran, who's been playing since 2008, when I say that this game is dead. There is no reason to play it anymore with stuff like Paladins and Overwatch around. They do a much better job at the whole ""competitive team based shooter"" thing, then Valve trying to shoehorn it into TF2 due to the success of said games.			"

												Okay, I'm sorry but I'm making one last review for this game until Valve goes out of their way to make it fun again, and no it's not pretty because I just hit ""Negative Review""First of all, the game began out as a fresh, inspiring FPS with a surprisingly huge amount of good balance, there were no cheap shots overall. The classes were fully ironed, fleshed out, and so much full of character, it was basically set in motion and written in stone that it was a good and entirely fun game overall. I would have even considered it better than 0verwatch now...WOULD..if they haven't changed the game at all since launch.1. WeaponsThen, this is where things got ugly...as much as people disagree with me on this (I laugh it off anyway), they started adding updates to the game, where NEW weapons were made for each of the classes over time. First with the pyro's new weapons, which horribly caused so much chaos on how unbalanced the Backburner was at launch along with medics taking priority on not healing anybody and attempting to kill with their ubersaws, and truly made the demoman way too powerful with crits. They of course nerfed the backburner, but instead of just calling it quits and reworking their new update system they brought out the same thing for the rest of the classes, bringing changes that completely stopped the balance of the gameplay. Oh, but that didn't stop at the Engineer update, no sir! They brought in sets you had to PAY to be able to use their abilities, or spend a god knows amount of time trading/crafting to get them all (not to mention they were INCREDIBLY overpowered). Luckily Valve realized this was an idiotic choice and removed it...3-4 years later. Lastly they started just shooting new weapons with broken stats every month for a while, the worst part being is that PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIKED THIS. Considerably I think the weapon system they brought in was a severely mediocre choice overall, as it's harder to tell what weapon/tool they are wielding before they use/shoot it at you or the weapon itself is big and shiny in appearance. It's also bad because it created ""weapon metas"" that should've never existed. In my opinion if they wanted to keep the game updated gameplay-wise, they should have gone with 0verwatch's philosophy with making new classes, so players know what to expect when facing said class instead of keeping them guessing what loadout one carried.2. CosmeticsNow I know what one is thinking ""Why on earth would you think cosmetics ruined this game?"", well it's a long story, but sit along as I tell you it. When hats first launched in 2009, this is where another big vision of where TF2's downfall began. Players started to find ways to exploit the crafting system that came with it, where they started to ""idle"" and do nothing for a god knows amount of time just to grab pointless, virtual hats. This, without a doubt, was breaking the point of the game to actually play the game. Valve tried to combat this by giving halos and cleaning backpacks of all those who walked into a Idle server, but this only made matters worse where a very dumb war between halo wearers and not halo wearers broke loose. It cooled down afterawhile, but things only got worse with hats when Mannconomy released.Not only the broken, P2W hat sets were released, but they have also brought in ""a pay an expensive amount for virtual hats and weapons store"", ""crates"", ""Artstyle-breaking paintbuckets"", and last of all ""Trading"". All of these things have really broke TF2's kneecaps as it started to diminish and absolutely destroy what made people come to love it, but newcomers were absolutely fooled by it's new appearance ""Hat Fortress 2"". Ever since then, TF2's identity when one first thinks of the name, they automatically think of ""Hats"". Overtime they just transitioned to stopped caring about the gameplay and focus more on their biggest money-wasting machine by purely making TF2 updates just for hats. Then later on over the years, they decided to really screw what's left of the game by adding in taunts which have COMPLETELY PUT ACTUAL GAMES TO A SCREECHING HALT. Guilty to say, it was funny at first, but then later is just got annoying and very stupid. It has died down, but nothing is more annoying than wanting to actually play the game when there's a party of conga-goers doing nothing. ""Friendly"" is just a stupid idea overall, but unfortunately apart of the game which a lot people seem to have an attitude over playing the objective.More taunts went on through making TF2 even more of a joke than it was now. You'd think they would have known this already has done too much damage to the game beyond repair, but you're wrong. They have brought in the ""skins"" from CS:GO and the Campaign pass, straight up copy and paste along with the ""take the enemy's weapon"" function from CS:GO. VALVe is definitely on a quest on seeing how low TF2 can get with it's cosmetics and good lord they are proving it so.3. CommunityNow too be fair, this section is entirely out of VALVe's hands and entirely because of the people who played this game. However, Valve should've taken precautions and think what said humans were going to think and do when said new features were added, like when adding the conga for example. The community was really great at first, nothing but smart people and talented artists showed up here to play, it was nothing short than amazing to see such a gathering. Overtime unfortunately, Valve completely started tainting the game's community as they decided to open it up for F2P to ""compete"" with other Free-to-Plays such as League of Legends.Since then, the community has been grouped and filled with numbskulls who always question Pyro's gender, or like Valve's business scheme without questioning it. Then of course when Valve deterred away from making anymore weapons, that's when the age of whining began. People left and right outright begging Valve to nerf Pyro, remove gunslinger, F2P vs P2P discrimination, and make more game-breaking weapons as well as usually consider themselves good at the game by using a complete crutch. It was toxic and it still is.4. Update ManagementVALVe always has been quiet when it comes to updates, put a good amount of hype, and used to really tweak out performance issues. Not saying they were great, but they certainly seemed like some manpower was involved in them. Unfortunately as time moved on, Valve has moved on more developers into other projects or even firing some who have done a considerable job, this resulted in TF2 suffering because of this. Updates ended up becoming more mediocre and has more questionably dumb choices in every single one, even flat out removing all the promised objects from End of the Line and ruined the hype that built up for it overall, making others like me completely lose all hope for the game. Not to mention the game has been harsh on older computers as FPS has gone haywire with the amount of cosmetics making performance a nightmare unless you have a really good gaming PC like I do. However, having a really good PC does not excuse Valve for making it poorly optimized.Worst part is, I hate sounding like the bad guy towards TF2, otherwise known as what used to be my favorite video game of all time.How the hell did one of my favorite video games of all time end up being one of the worst games of all time for me after updates is a complete mystery, but Valve managed to find a way to do it.Well, I'm considering an offer to Valve that if they can make me play it like before, I'll remove this review entirely and move on. Unfortunately it seems that today isn't that day, thus Overwatch for me.			"

												I was gonna write a review, but I assumed it would be too confusing for new players. Instead, here's the wikipedia entry for Ducks:Duck is the common name for a large number of species in the Anatidae family of birds, which also includes swans and geese. The ducks are divided among several subfamilies in the Anatidae family; they do not represent a monophyletic group (the group of all descendants of a single common ancestral species) but a form taxon, since swans and geese are not considered ducks. Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, mostly smaller than the swans and geese, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water.Ducks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water birds with similar forms, such as loons or divers, grebes, gallinules, and coots.The word duck comes from Old English *dūce ""diver"", a derivative of the verb *dūcan ""to duck, bend down low as if to get under something, or dive"", because of the way many species in the dabbling duck group feed by upending; compare with Dutch duiken and German tauchen ""to dive"".This word replaced Old English ened/ænid ""duck"", possibly to avoid confusion with other Old English words, like ende ""end"" with similar forms. Other Germanic languages still have similar words for ""duck"", for example, Dutch eend ""duck"" and German Ente ""duck"". The word ened/ænid was inherited from Proto-Indo-European; compare: Latin anas ""duck"", Lithuanian ántis ""duck"", Ancient Greek nēssa/nētta (νῆσσα, νῆττα) ""duck"", and Sanskrit ātí ""water bird"", among others.A duckling is a young duck in downy plumage[1] or baby duck;[2] but in the food trade young adult ducks ready for roasting are sometimes labelled ""duckling"".[citation needed]A male duck is called a drake and the female duck is called a duck, or in ornithology a hen.The overall body plan of ducks is elongated and broad, and the ducks are also relatively long-necked, albeit not as long-necked as the geese and swans. The body shape of diving ducks varies somewhat from this in being more rounded. The bill is usually broad and contains serrated lamellae, which are particularly well defined in the filter-feeding species. In the case of some fishing species the bill is long and strongly serrated. The scaled legs are strong and well developed, and generally set far back on the body, more so in the highly aquatic species. The wings are very strong and are generally short and pointed, and the flight of ducks requires fast continuous strokes, requiring in turn strong wing muscles. Three species of steamer duck are almost flightless, however. Many species of duck are temporarily flightless while moulting; they seek out protected habitat with good food supplies during this period. This moult typically precedes migration.The drakes of northern species often have extravagant plumage, but that is moulted in summer to give a more female-like appearance, the ""eclipse"" plumage. Southern resident species typically show less sexual dimorphism, although there are exceptions like the Paradise Shelduck of New Zealand which is both strikingly sexually dimorphic and where the female's plumage is brighter than that of the male. The plumage of juvenile birds generally resembles that of the female.You must pay $5 USD to continue reading "

												It's a war-based first-person shooter that ISN'T a bloody Modern Military Shooter (henceforth referred to as MMS). What's not to like? Granted, the game has become overtaken with hats. But I'd say that's one of the reasons Valve decided to make the game free-to-play. They've received enough money from it thus far, and they don't need to rely on the money from every purchase to keep the game going.Unlike most MMS games, this one isn't re-released every single year with 1 or 2 minor changes and with a new name slapped on it. This game undergoes, just like other Valve games (and a lot of other Steam games for that matter), perpetual evolution without the need to be re-released.Sure, it has no single-player campaign. But there's the Portal and Half-Life series of games for that. It's a varied game with plenty of game modes that all run on the same sort of infrastructure but are different in varying ways. It's a good game. I'd recommend it.  "

												This is a well made, stylized, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels.There are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'.Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objectives for both teams to achieve.'Mann Verses Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, ""Mann Up"", gives rewards upon completing a ""tour"".In addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available.In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them.The game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play.			"

												Going on 8 years and still doing very well for itself, TF2 is a testament to Valve's dedication and consistent content support across all their games. TF2 is unique because it's ostensibly undergone the biggest changes of any of Valve's other games, through hundreds of free updates. To some, that's a bad thing - that TF2's initially unique and intelligent art direction has been diluted with hats, cosmetics and things that seem to make no visual sense. But it adds layers of customization, trading and player interaction that form a remarkable metagame. The new weapons and maps have done nothing but add extra replayability and depth to the game - and it even has its own active competitive scene.Then you have things like Mann vs Machine, the custom server community and their unique player-made mods and you have an experience that still has a lot of life in it and a seemingly endless supply of... well, game. Oh, and it's free.			"

Team Fortress 2, a game long joked about being a war-themed hat simulator should be praised, and here is why.Team Fortress 2 is a game I believe can really fit with all kinds of gamers, from all kinds of scenes. Whether you're into MOBAs, already into FPS's, or just a general player of games, TF2 can find some way to work itself into your heart.Part 1: The ClassesThe classes in Team Fortress 2 are all well-balanced characters that fit into a special role of a team, their well-craftedness leaves the real struggle to the player to make the class shine above all others. The roles of each class don't even stop at what  the class could really do. There are so many sub-classes and builds and weapons that change how the entire game functions, it's versatility expands far beyond just what it's labelled as. The classes and their wonderfully fleshed-out personalities with different backgrounds helps you to invest in them and really become a part of them, and possibly have them become a part of you.Part 2: The WeaponsWeapons in TF2 aren't really improvements to the stock, which makes it different than alot of other games. They're another type of playstyle, another way to play the game. Want the Heavy to be even more of a damage dealer? Use the Brass Beast. Want a reward for all those headshots you're getting as Sniper? Use the Bazaar Bargain. The weapons help broaden the possibilities and types of play of the game, chances are you won't meet players with the same loadout, and even better chances you won't find them using the same kind of playstyle. All in all, I know there might be some sour apples in the bunch, but the range of weapons and the manners in which you can use them is spectacular, and helps others find classes they like.Part 3: The HatsYou knew this was coming, admit it. The game's cosmetic system isn't all that there is, but it's one hell of a huge chunk. Ever since the first few hats were added, it changed the game. From the beginning, it was one for one, a hat for a hat, but soon, the seed of economy was planted. The economy grew and flourished, values were established. currencies were made, and the true spirit of the war-themed hat simulator came to fruition. The economy is a real shining gem in this game, while prices may seem absurd, it really is astonishing how a video game managed to grow an economy that easily translates virtual goods into monetary value with the unboxing of a crate. The community lives around this creation, molds it, creates it, they coexist peacefully and abide by one another's rules. Not only does the market shine, but the cosmetics themselves, too. Each piece can be equipped together in no specific order (aside from some restrictions with clipping, of course), meaning a bunch of combinations for your signature, unique look. This furthers the customization from weapons, and really helps to make you, you.OverallIn the end, TF2's a flexible game. No matter what genre of game you're most accustomed to, TF2 will have a place in your heart. Interesting, quirky characters set in the middle of nowhere, fighting over who-knows-what. Plenty of methods of customization to make it fit you. A community that's pretty darn great, and a good bunch of pretty-looking hats. This game more than earns my 10/10, for as much as it counts.(P.S. It's flippin' free!) "

												The game gets worse every year/every update.Instead of keeping it as a cool , fun game as it was, valve is tryharding to make it a competitor of Overwatch, and fails horribly. In the last years, Valve ruined the art style, the performance, the balance, and the atmosphere with forcing the competitive playstyle (which is kinda the opposite of what TF2 was made for) . Lately they ruined the matchmaking too(which seems like a trend for them nowadays.. khmm.. l4d2 official servers khmm...), so you have to wait 15 mins to join to a horribly unbalanced match (often there are 3-4 player differences between teams), just to be forced to rejoin the matchmaking after the end of the match. Basically the gameplay is a big queue window now. The developers are focusing so hard to suck out every little possible penny from the game (hello microtransactions, hello ticket system) they dont care about the player experience. You know those series which should have ended like 2-3 seasons ago, while they were good, but the writers just ♥♥♥♥ed it up and now they are the parody of themselves? TF2 is the gaming version of that. Would be better to just shut it down, before all the good memories fade. tl;dr: You are 3-5 years late for a good TF2. Now its a tryhard copy of better games.			"

												This game could potentially be a life long friend of mine. Yearly Christmas & Halloween updates, large to medium content updates throughout the year, bugs crushed within weeks, and smaller updates sprinkled in. This game's longevity is certainly one of it's many strengths.As an FPS with so many weapons and features, it remains extremely comprehensive and balanced (Regardless of what most players say). Weapons are added every now and then, and current weapons' stats are always under inspection for balance issues. The control is extremely tight as all source games are, movement always seems fluent and never clunky. The skill ceiling for movement/mobility is extremely high and allows for lots of very tricky moves (eg. Rocket/sticky jumping, sentry jumping, strafing, etc..) Generally the skill ceiling for TF2 is very, very high; with almost 3,000 hours at the time of posting this i am nowhere near the skill level of more experianced players.The community is still strong and persistant as the game ages and brings in new players. An overall friendly and welcoming community awaits new players, as well as a thriving competitive scene in both Europe and the States. Not to mention the incredible fan-created artwork and short films on youtube and other sites. TF2 has an incredibly involved trading scene which was born from the staggering amount of hats and cosmetic items that you can get. The trading scene can be brutal at times, but nothing quite stands up to the feeling of getting a sweet new item after spending time trading up for it. (Oh and did i mention you can sell TF2 items for PayPal cash if you're advanced enough?)In summation, Team Fortress 2 is a game for the ages. This game has something for everyone if you look for it, and you'll undoubtedly meet some amazing people and make new friends.			"

												Team Fortress 2 is the best free-to-play first person shooter in the world today. It's pure free-to-play, which means that everything is available at the beginning. You don't have to spend money on this game, except when you want to trade or buy cosmetic items. So what is this game all about? Well, you play in team of 1 to 12 (or even more) players and you try to beat the other team. TF2 features several gamemodes, Capture Point and Payload for example, and 9 'classes'. Each class has it's own pros and cons, and can be used for specific tasks. For example, the Engineer is a great defender and the Scout is very effective in capture-based gamemodes.TF2 is very n00b-friendly, since the game features Offline Training against bots and tutorials, as well as the coöp tower-defense gamemode Mann vs. Machine. TF2 is a relatively simple game, you don't require a lot of knowledge to be good at it. The game also has a large economy of items, which you get by playing or trading. These are pure cosmetic, except most weapons, and don't give you an advantage towards other players.Verdict--------This game is very enjoyable and funny, it's very different compared to other FPS games. It features several awesome gamemodes and funny classes. Some of the cosmetics are really funny, you can hit people with a mackerel and candy for example. An awesome free-to-play shooter you should play today.Your friends will not see you outside for at least 100 hours. If you become a ""TF2 Trader"" you will spend at least 400 hours on this game.Score: 89/100			"

												I have to thank Team Fortress 2 for leading me for several thousand hours of gaming throughout the years. I love all the friends I made along the way aswell, but something changed in tf2. The community has nearly been abandoned by all the ""old"" players leaving behind a community that comes off as toxic. TF2 used to be my favorite game while update and update have many asking what's the deal with all these let downs, VALVe has started giving TF2 the short end of the stick as CS:GO and DOTA 2 take the spotlight. As TF2 and the community is right now I don't recommend getting into it anymore, both the game and the community are now a drag.			"

												Casual is absolutely the worst. It doesn't feel like Team Fortress 2 anymore. It isn't fun to play. It actually feels like a chore to play instead. You have long queue times just to get into a game and then most of the time it's a one sided fight. In the few I've played, if players left on either team, they were not replaced before the game ended and it made it even more one sided. I want to play this game and I want to love it, but I don't want to play it in its current state. Quickplay was awesome to just mess around in. Now everyone has to act like a complete try hard or else lose.			"

												I never wanted to take Team Fortress 2 seriously.I just wanted to play Payload Race. I just want to have fun.November 26 update. I did it for the badge.So, after it was very clear that Blissard has no idea what actually makes a game fun- I thought I'd return to TF2 to see the damage done to the game I dropped 4,000 hours in.This game as it was, is still unplayable. I joined a queue with my friend who could show me the ropes of the update. We queued for around five minutes for 'Quick'play and ended up joining a half finished game with the other team doing a death push. Two minutes later they won, and we went back to queuing for another couple of minutes.This is less TF2 than ever. The fact that you have to queue so long just for what should be, as its name states, ""Quickplay"" is just ridiculous. No one should be okay with this. I certainly wasn't.  I was clearly spoiled by the pervious system where I would open the server browser, click the sort by Ping and join the most filled PLR Valve server on the list. This took only a couple seconds and I was in a game.Beyond that, this new point system for quickplay is just balls.I don't want a rank. I don't want to collect points for my casual games.  No one needs to know my skill level. If I want to just goof off with a gibus on, I want to be able to without ridicule or people knowing better.What made this game a blast for me was joining a very diverse Valve community server, pretending I was a noob, and waiting for the first guy who'd get too cocky about how good they were at wrecking new players and ruining their day.So I tired finding a nice community server to play on, where it would be as close to the normal Valve Community server set up.(Spoiler:  There are none)The EndI have downloaded so many bad edits of maps from dead servers.  Please consider bringing back quick joinable Community servers Valve.			"

												I'm gonna be honest, as I write this, my heart breaks with every word typed. Tf2 used to be a wonderful game. Even A year ago  it was the pinnacle of class-based shooters. Fun, fast paced, team-oriented, and easy to pick up/put down for new or busy players.But now?Its like seeing your father or mother slowly break down into an alchoholic Going from once trusting and loving Valve to....this, whatever this is!What I'm talking about is, of course, this backwards stream of updates that have been coming out.-We were promised updates to game modes, weapons, and maps, and all we got were reskins and hats.-We were promised better weapons balanced for the most powerful weapons in the gameInstead? A buff. Something to even further ruin the day. -Its just not fun even more, to hear ""♥♥♥♥ you"" when asking for less snipers ""Deal with it or quit"" they say, like a repeating, drunken piper.-You want more weapons and maps? Too bad, you get weapon skins and Hats!-Whats that? A bug you say? Lets fix it 3 months later, have some more weapons skins, now shut up and good day!-The new ranking system is just that; a rank. Theres no reward for playing offense, defense or tank. - Hope you dont like to heal, because only snipers and spies will be your deal-Finally, and perhaps worse of all, are the half-asses updates that actually BREAK the game. Its not that hard to do something less lame. Perhaps pulling an ear to your friends, families, and peers would help, BUT ALAS! They look as us, shrug, and yelp; ""Get over it, its our game, now give us more money, ignore the pain!"" Thank youEdit: for those who don't like my rhyme, what I'm basically saying is Tf2 has become a garbage pail of its former self. Valve has shown countless times it does not care about this game anymore, especially with its updates that end up breaking the game more than usual. Not only that, but Valve seems to completely ignore and ♥♥♥♥ on the player. In this last year, we have 1 new sniper weapon, 1 new scout weapon, and 2 demo weapons that nobody uses because they are basically useless in comparison to the other weapons, yet Valve has only done 1 thing about it: Buffed a weapon called the phlogistinator, even though that's the OPPOSITE of what people want. Also, they put the ""free to play"" tag on Tf2 but it is certainly NOT f2p. The whole premise of the game is character customization, yet unless you pay money you're not gonna do that. Hell, you can't even play the co-op mode without paying money. In the 1,300 hours I have played, only 2 items I have received for free. The community is god awful. I get it, it's a casual shooter, but I shouldn't have to BEG people to play a medic or an engineer on a 12-person team. I shouldn't have to pick up the slack of my team (as shouldn't anyone) because of incompetence. Now, this isn't saying that new players shouldn't play, but even a new player should have SOME level of cognitive function. Aka: I shouldn't have to stalk a teammate because they don't know how to look up or look behind them. Or tell a medic to heal instead of fight. Or tell THAT THIRD ♥♥♥♥ING SNIPER TO NOT BE A SNIPER. Other than that, there are people who just DONT play the game. The stand in spawn or stand in the middle of the map over, and over, and over, and over. And not to mention the kids, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, idiots, and trolls in the game. You thought COD was bad with kids? Try 18+'s with mindsets of a kid. Or a kid who literally just SCREAMS into the mic for no good reason. Yes you can mute these people but why do I have to? Hell, during last years Halloween valve had to force people to STOP killing each other in order to actually play the min objective: killing a boss. That gives an item. A FREE ITEM FROM A BOSS. Are these people stupid or just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s? You decide. If I were an update tester for Tf2 right now, I'd leave a sticky note that just says ""fix it""			"

Originally posted by TF2's store page:New to TF? Don’t sweat it!
No matter what your style and experience, we’ve got a character for you. Detailed training and offline practice modes will help you hone your skills before jumping into one of TF2’s many game modes
Valves dev team and TF2Valve has absolutely no idea what they're doing with the game, ranging from god awful optimization, a dev team that prioritizes number analysis, cosmetic sales and MvM over basic things such as (nonexistent) weapon balance and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ attempt at a ""competitive mode"" that is an insult to TF2s competitive leagues and LANs - and that's just the tip of the iceberg. The game also features the most bare-bones offline tutorial I have ever seen and marketing it as ""beginner friendly"" or even ""helpful"" is stretching it very far.It is very sad to say I would still recommend this game, if you look at the core gameplay you have a very good / fun / engaging multiplayer shooter. The game allows for a lot of individual and unique styles of play, both casually and competitively. Everyone enjoys it for different reasons and and there is nothing really out there that meshes players of all skill levels as well as TF2 does. And there is no dev like valves tf2 dev team when it comes to destroying the game.I'd like to say that there are two kinds of devs when it comes to games - the type that plays their own game and would react strongly if a new player didn't enjoy the game because the lack of a tutorial, confusion with mechanics, complaints about random crits, the queue system, lack of a community contact and so on. The type of dev that aims to deliver a great experience and keeping in sync with the player base and what they want.And there is the current dev team who does the complete opposite, is so out of sync with both the casual and competitive community and doesn't understand what makes a game like tf2 great. A dev team that wants to buff already broken weapons based on ""usage numbers"" and push more micro transaction cash-bait rare-cosmetics as opposed to implement a basic join-friends feature in the casual queue.The list could go on but I'm not going to list every single thing wrong with the game. To be completely honest you get so used to all the garbage they've done to the game and at some point you just get desensitized and stop caring. Simple quality-of-life things that were IN THE GAME 2-3 years ago such as being able to join friends and dedicated valve servers through a server browser have now been replaced by a queue system where the ping limiter doesn't work (enjoy playing on Virginia servers if you have 1 American in your party) and once you join a server, the most reliable way to have a friend join you is to either leave and re-queue or have them queue only that map and hope for the best. The latter has worked twice in 2 years from my experience. There was absolutely no need to replace the old system, but that should give you an impression of how well the current dev team handles Team Fortress 2.The competitive communityI'm not going to go terribly in-depth into the competitive community and how valve has treated it like a neglected child but long story short; the competitive TF2 community has lived on its own legs for a solid 9 or so years (hey, almost 10!) ranging from community-hosted leagues, LANs, tournaments & cups, configurations & rules, a centralized hub with competitive-community developed resources such as custom HUDS, maps, hitsounds, tweaks and optimizations, community driven forums, content & casts, pickup-channels/websites, guides for newcomers, streams and its own memes and sub-communities.I've always enjoyed playing the game casually and I still do. I got into the competitive side as a curious younger myself and started to get better and know more people, I still enjoy that too. I've met people in real life from events and LANs and had a blast with them as much as I've enjoyed just playing the game at the highest level. I don't feel like this needs to be explained, but when you're sitting there late at night with these people you met over a niche competitive game, its more than a game. When you're playing casual with your friends every day throughout the summer and have a good time together, its more than ""just a game"".And valve has done absolutely nothing for it. They've ignored competitive support for the game only until Overwatch was about to be released. Their answer; a ""competitive matchmaking"" queue / ladder which has NO class restrictions, NO weapon ban list, NO map selection and god awful maps and NO dx8 support, which forces everyone to run the game on dx9 for sub 60 FPS in a supposedly ""competitive"" mode. Its an absolute joke how they manage to do so poorly with the months of data people gave them from the beta test. But they only look at a numerical analysis as opposed to actual feedback, and, you know, playing their own game.They ignored the competitive community offer to help them and just copy-pasted the UI from MvM and called it a day. Its not that they-re incompetent, they're both incompetent and lazy - as a valve employee had posted on the competitive forums it proves that they know about its existence but chose to ignore it. Source: http://www.teamfortress.tv/user/vJillIt also affects the casual communityI feel like this needs to be said if the point hasn't come across: They've managed to ♥♥♥♥ over both the casual and competitive community for no reason other than being lazy and incompetent. Hell, for all I know they could also be out-of-touch and listening to the wrong player base - or the worst of both worlds, you never know. The game being old or ""dated"" is not an excuse, people still play and like the concept of it. Valve has openly stated that TF2 is an ""experiment"" for them to test and push ideas and economies but that does not justify the treatment the game has gotten outside of those areas.We who have played the game for a long time and have been with it only to see it evolve and slowly become what it is - and we who perhaps hoped that one day there would be some kind of co-existence between the casual and competitive community only for valve to take a dump on it due to incompetence and laziness are greatly dissatisfied. Take Overwatch as an example; its a much worse game but a large portion of the high level TF2 players have migrated since the prize pools and Blizzards support is a dream land compared to what Valve is doing for TF2. You can actually make it there if you invest time.If you invest time in TF2 you can only make as much as you yourself make out of it. I've had great experiences both online and offline and its clear that Valve has given up on doing remotely anything for the player base, no matter if you're a beginner or a high level player. They're happy as long as they can live in their world of data analysis and micro transaction sales. To be blunt, they only care about the players if their numbers start to move in a negative direction. You reap what you sow.Couple this great dissatisfaction with unbalance, gimmicks, performance issues, unreliable queue times and a flood of new players who have issues shooting a stationary target with a rocket launcher and you see the problems.And for the sake of preserving, here is my old joke review. The old dev team wasn't perfect either.April 14, 2011 Patch (Hatless Update)Replaced the no-crit attribute with -25% damage on the following:        Eyelander        Gunslinger        Southern Hospitality        Powerjack        Horseless Headless Horseman's Headtaker        Ullapool Caber        Claidheamh Mòr.April 15, 2011 PatchReplaced the -25% damage attribute with no-crit attribute on the following:        Eyelander        Gunslinger        Southern Hospitality        Horseless Headless Horseman's Headtaker        Ullapool Caber        Claidheamh Mòr			"

												An extremely fun FPS game. Beautiful graphics and nice audio. It has a pretty fun gameplay and there are different modes. There are special items which you receive and then can trade or play with. There are crates which you receive as well and you can buy or trade keys to unlock the crates. You can also sell the crates. If you buy a TF2 item you start getting better drops which is pretty good. It's always fun to play TF2 and it's a good time killer as well. I really recommend downloading this game It's pretty damn fun! Rated 10/10!			"

												It used to be a good game, but, in a failed attempt to compete with Overwatch's sudden popularity, Valve managed to destroy the game with the ""Meet your Match"" update.The update removed the ""Quick Play"" mode and replaced it with a ""Casual"" mode and a ""Competitive"" mode, both which force the game to be played on ""matches"", which had no auto-balancing, no map voting, and, at each map, it would load the map again, turning the game, literally, into a ""loading simulator"".There was no reason why ""Quick Play"" had to be removed, but it was, effectively forcing people to play the new ""match system"" they liked it or not.Recently Valve implemented map voting on the end of matches and some sort of minor rebalancing funcionality which isn't very effective at all.At the moment the game isn't fun, neither fluid. Under these conditions, there are just better alternatives out there.			"

												This game used to be good.Then Valve decided it was a good time to crap on it. Every update no matter how big or small breaks the game in a unrelated way, usually to a point where it doesn't even want to run probably. There's a huge pile of weapons that are so horrible to play with it's not even funny any more. The most recent big update (Smissmass 2015 at the time of writing) basically made Pyro go from a class that takes some skill to a complete braindead W+M1 class. Demoknighting, the most fun thing to do in the entire game is now also dead and on anything but Windows this game doesn't run. At all. It just crashes instantly as soon as you go on a full server due to the horrendous coding job Valve has done (and they state performance is massively improved, yeah right, joke of the century). And all of this is packed in a 1:1 copy of the Gun Mettle update with even more ugly weapon skins that add no value to the game with the same boring and easy-as-crap contracts. Valve lost every single bit of sense on this game over the course of one update and there's no sign of that ever resolving itself. Oh and you wanted any of the cosmetics or weapons? Yeah you have to spend $6 on a campaign pass and then even more on a key to open the crate with the chance of you getting anything worth more than the combined cost of getting a crate and opening it are basically zero. Any future update will be a 1:1 copy of Gun Mettle since it's Valve's easiest way to make a ton of money without doing anything useful.tl:dr this game would be much better if it was developed by anybody other than Valve.Do yourself a favor and stay away from this steaming pile of garbage. Honestly. Go play Overwatch or something.			"

												Team Fortress 2 used to be a good game in like older times, well I stopped playing the game nearly 3 years ago but now it seems to gotten much worse since I stopped. Here's what I don't like about the game:THE COMMUNITYThis has been a problem since the beginning, and making it free to play (even when I started as a free to play) made it even worse. They expect you to be 100% perfect at the game and if you don't stay up to par with your team, they will blame most things on you, even when you didn't seem to do anything. They also have a chance to make fun of you if you have no hats or taunts or anything, which according to them, if you have no items in the game, you're obviously a bad player, and if you have a backpack filled with rare items and is worth like thousands of dollars, you're automatically considered a pro at the game.There's the players who are way too good at the game, which ruin the fun by taking all of the kills and making the opposing team scared and, of course, making them rage. Most of the time, someone calls a vote to scramble the teams, or they go into spectate mode and wait 3 hours just so they can join the other team. I honestly think that people are easily enraged by this simple game.MICROTRANSACTIONSAnother way of slaying people's wallets and life savings. This has become a common thing in many games today, which does include PAYDAY 2 and Killing Floor 2, but I honestly think this game has the most microtransactions. They seem to be almost like getting addicted to a drug, your brain just wants more and more of it, and if you don't get enough, you suffer withdrawl and end up wasting your money on something virtual instead of something better you could buy in real life. I think there's even, for example, a skin for a knife for the Spy costs more than a knife in real life.GAMEPLAYI guess the gameplay is what keeps many players involved. The gameplay is not actually that bad, but it's mostly ruined simply by the community. The game is also considered very unbalanced from what I have heard with the new update. Competitive and Casual appear to be very unbalanced, commonly from the opposing team class-stacking (having multiple players play as the same class as one another). The XP system is also dumb, because the only way to get XP from games is by winning, nothing but winning. You get a kill? Nope, no XP for you.The gameplay may apply with what I said earlier in the community, with how some players are so skilled at the game that they take the fun out of it and make the enemy team scatter. There's no separate servers that are for skilled players only, and there aren't too many assets that indicate a skilled player.2/10 - Definitely do not recommend playing this game for thousands of hours ... or even hundreds.

												Worst community i've ever experienced in my life. 80% are very angry American/English teenagers, %10 are whiners and ♥♥♥♥♥ers who accuse you of hacking just because you dominated them, and the other 10% are good players. The 80% are the absolute ♥♥♥♥ing worst though. They single you out by only killing you and calling you names. You don't even have to do anything to get singled out. They are too aggressive and they ruin the game. Countless times now I've been forced out of servers by these kinds of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and why I say 80% is because 75% of the server joins in with them to upset you. You could be the MvP for 5 rounds straight and STILL get no respect from anyone. It's odd behaviour, like a dog who just doesn't like a certain mailman for some completley unknown reason. They just hate your guts.Because of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community, I can't play online anymore. It's not fun, and it ruins my day when I get bombarded by all sorts of uncalled ♥♥♥♥♥♥ names. All I wanted to do was just run around and kill people, not get called every name under the sun. So now I only play Offline Practice, and even that gets boring after a while. I've been playing Offline Practice for years, and Valve has hardly updated it. The bots are braindead sometimes, they don't use any weapons except vanilla, and the amount of maps is laughable. Players like me have been let down by Valve because of their neglect of the Offline Practice mode.I find the game very fun, but I'm only playing around a quater of it. The rest of the game lies with the Online aspects, which I can no longer play because of TF2's disgustingly offensive community. The Offline bots may be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ most of the time, but at least they don't poke and prod you constantly trying to get you to leave the server.			"

												My Review used to be for this game, a very positive one, that talked about how this game can fit ""any type of gamer"" and ""has just the right amount of weirdness for everyone"". While I wish that was still as true as it was, TF2 now a days is just a old shell of its formel self. I can't even get into a party with all of my friends anymore, never the less find a game and have as much fun as we all used to. I just wish Valve cared as much as they used to. I have spent over $200 on this game, putting hundreds of hours into training to become better at the game, even making my own Australium Scattergun from the game. But it seems like all of this has been lost, from the loss of the community, loss of effort in recent updates, and loss of my positive review. Until the game is rightfully fixed, I can't give it a thumbs up.			"

												game was fun before meet your match and now it's ♥♥♥♥ and unplayable.Though valve has tried to help fix tf2 and everything it has not really helped.Valve added a rematch system but nobody votes for it because one side completly rage quits.Comp is a joke it's full of new players who think they are good.I would recommend this to people but it's gone too far at this point and people should really be staying away from tf2 and then valve might actually do ♥♥♥♥.Hit reg is also ♥♥♥♥ed up along with it's hitboxes so if you don't want to play a game where you can die to just one guy shooting a wall and you die randomly then don't play this game.People could handle this ♥♥♥♥ before meet your match but ever since meet your match came it has killed tf2 and the so called great pyro update and the jungle update valve has promised ya ask anyone who has played before meet your match and they will all tell you it's going to be ♥♥♥♥.Tf2 is not playable anymore it's cancer.Also even though i voted for team pyro i still honestly hate pyro's.W+M1 pyro's are all scrubs and all pyro mains want pyro to be buffed more.Valve has already buffed pyro enough and it's time for some more nerfs because they love killing demoknight and love the pyro.To all those who read this stay away from Tf2.No people who quit tf2 for overwatch are not really scrubs because they most likely quit because of this ♥♥♥♥.#VaveKilledTf2NotOverwatch			"

												Review made by Kurakao, who had 2,566 hours of Team Fortress 2 while writing this review on 5.10.2014 (DD/MM/YYYY)Includes:1. TF2 from my PoV (Point of View)2. About Team Fortress 23. Experiences & details4.1-3. About game-modes5. Competitive in a nutshell6. Recommendations from it7. My own experiences and why8. TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read aka this whole thing nutshelled in a sentence.)9. My rating1. What can I say? This is the reason I downloaded Steam. Because I wanted so hard to test this game out. I saw this game everywhere and I was always wondering like: ""Hmm.. What kind of a game this might be? Like Counter Strike mixed with it's own weirdness."" And I was half-true.2. Team Fortress 2 is like mixing the Quake games, Counter-Strike, and a bit of fashion and hats all the way. This is the reason TF2 is so fun; You get to do any kind of hat/misc combinations (cosmetics these days) and you can create your own individual looks how people recognize you from others. I remember using funny combinations, so people recognized me easily and were like: ""Oh hey Kurakao! I just noticed you came in because I saw that awesome set of yours.""3. Team Fortress 2 is extremely fun, team-based (depends what style you play. I play DM (DeathMatch) alot, which is basically just killing with no point), somehow restricted with the 9 classes, but doesn't restrict enough to not be individually weird-styled, and it's extremely addictive.4.1. I have never played anything as addictive as Team Fortress 2. This is extremely fun to play, and you can play any kind of gameplay you like: You can go either Saxton Hale (vsh_) maps to run away from the evil boss monsters that is controlled by a single player and he chases trying to kill you.4.2. Then there's my favourite customs: PropHunt, which is the same as in GMOD; you disguise as an object and the enemies are trying to catch you. Firing your weapon decreases your hp so you need to be careful not to spam.4.3. Then there are normal based maps; PayLoad, Capture Point, King of The Hill, etc. etc. which is hardly-based on teamwork and who plays what. It usually costs the team a victory if they are full-team Snipers or Spies or whatsoever, unless they are pro-tier players. But usually it ends up the team who has a better class-support, wins.----You can stop reading here and scroll down if you don't want to know anything about competitive---5.

												Review made by Kurakao, who had 2,566 hours of Team Fortress 2 while writing this review on 5.10.2014 (DD/MM/YYYY)Includes:1. TF2 from my PoV (Point of View)2. About Team Fortress 23. Experiences & details4.1-3. About game-modes5. Competitive in a nutshell6. Recommendations from it7. My own experiences and why8. TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read aka this whole thing nutshelled in a sentence.)9. My rating1. What can I say? This is the reason I downloaded Steam. Because I wanted so hard to test this game out. I saw this game everywhere and I was always wondering like: ""Hmm.. What kind of a game this might be? Like Counter Strike mixed with it's own weirdness."" And I was half-true.2. Team Fortress 2 is like mixing the Quake games, Counter-Strike, and a bit of fashion and hats all the way. This is the reason TF2 is so fun; You get to do any kind of hat/misc combinations (cosmetics these days) and you can create your own individual looks how people recognize you from others. I remember using funny combinations, so people recognized me easily and were like: ""Oh hey Kurakao! I just noticed you came in because I saw that awesome set of yours.""3. Team Fortress 2 is extremely fun, team-based (depends what style you play. I play DM (DeathMatch) alot, which is basically just killing with no point), somehow restricted with the 9 classes, but doesn't restrict enough to not be individually weird-styled, and it's extremely addictive.4.1. I have never played anything as addictive as Team Fortress 2. This is extremely fun to play, and you can play any kind of gameplay you like: You can go either Saxton Hale (vsh_) maps to run away from the evil boss monsters that is controlled by a single player and he chases trying to kill you.4.2. Then there's my favourite customs: PropHunt, which is the same as in GMOD; you disguise as an object and the enemies are trying to catch you. Firing your weapon decreases your hp so you need to be careful not to spam.4.3. Then there are normal based maps; PayLoad, Capture Point, King of The Hill, etc. etc. which is hardly-based on teamwork and who plays what. It usually costs the team a victory if they are full-team Snipers or Spies or whatsoever, unless they are pro-tier players. But usually it ends up the team who has a better class-support, wins.----You can stop reading here and scroll down if you don't want to know anything about competitive---5. Then there was competitive where I played some of my time. I was only Division 6 and I played as a Roamer.

												Oh TF2, oh TF2.. We've come a long way, but everything will end eventually, no matter how fun it was. If you are looking for the game's details, read the positive reviews, I will have a little rant here. A few years ago I found this game through the famous ""meet the series"", after I started playing I was instantly hooked by the amazing variety of gameplay, even though I do not play anymore do to the reason I will give below I am still active in the community, some of you might know as Gilgamesh from OpenGriefing.  The game: With the nine classes and huge amount of weapons that come with it TF2 is a game which you can play for days, even months! Each class has their own individual role which is completely unique to it, you can play in all sort of ways, and there is so much to do it rarely feels repeditive. The community is nice, and although most do not appreciate the sight of a new player, there is still a huge amount of nice people. I my self have taught 4 players on how to play TF2 whom I personally don't even know, and I had great fun in doing so, and there more people out there that do the same. The game has a series of cosmedic items which add a lot of life and color into it. You can dress the big muscle guy called the heavy with his huge machine gun up with a fairy custom, or you can turn the German doctor called the Medic into a WW2 German infantryman of the battle of Stalingrad, these are two examples of thousands of possibilities. There are many game modes and dozens of maps for each, which let you play the game for an unbelievable amount of time with out getting bored once. These are just the official maps. There are tens-of-thousands of community maps which also enhance the gaming experience.   The community: TF2 is a very old game, yet it is one of the most played multiplayer games even today. The community is very committed and it was the community that made the game what it is today. Valve kept the game fresh by releasing updates that always added more content with which you could play with your friends and have loads of fun.   With that being said, here comes the problem: As I said, TF2 has a very committed and loyal community even though the game is from today's standards as old as the bread crumbs that are left in a toaster that one day have the fortune of being vaporized, leaving the toaster as dust. Now, valve always showed their appreciation for this through out the year by adding fresh content. This however, has changed.  Valve, like other companies, has noticed the potential of modern competitive games, one genre of which is MOBAs. It is also very obvious that they have grown old of TF2 and want to work on different things. Their plan to keep the game alive, while slowly leaving it was to let their loyal community take over, which I have to say is quite an honorable thing to do.  However, they have completely failed at it.  The problem is, the community may be able to handle parts of the game, but not the entire game it self. It is impossible do to many factors. By this I mean, the community might be able to add content like hats and taunts to the game, but they can not expand the gaming experience, the expanding the gaming experience is exactly what made TF2 a special game, every year there was always something new to try out and after doing that, the normal game was appealing again, and the loop continued. But instead of fixing the issue, they just want to pull it through till the end, like dragging a bleeding body to the hospital but knowing that it won't make it.  Warning Rant: They also treat the community wrong, they have gotten to used to the community of TF2 treating them like some kind of divine council. They think anything will satisfy it. An example of this is the ♥♥♥♥ing ducks. Some people complained that the ""End of the Line"" not including snowplow, with Valves' response being 'It is too complicated for new players"", from what I have heard though, the did not include the map due to it not reaching their standards, which is fine by me. Also the lack of weapons that were promised by the creator of the animation did not appear, which was upsetting, but still bearable.  What really shoved the middle finger up my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ though, was the ducks. The ♥♥♥♥ing ducks that cost 5 ♥♥♥♥ING EUROS. FOR ♥♥♥♥ING DUCKS! Is this some sort of joke? Was Valve thinking,""Ayy Lmao, ducks are funny right?"" from  Valve and the End of the Line team. Without the ducks, I would have nothing to complain about, but if they seriously think that DUCKS will satisfy their loyal community after they miss out on the promised weapons and a new game mode, then must have ♥♥♥♥ing plumbum in their water supply, They tried making up to it by rushing 3 new weapons which are all useless and uncreative. The creativity is what counts, not the effectiveness of the weapon.  Pre-access, now for TF2 also! Another issue is BETA maps, they adapted the method of their platform into TF2. They release unfinished ♥♥♥♥, act like it is finished but still needs ""fixing"" and let the community do all the work, instead of actually using already made maps by the community OR getting of their asses and finishing them. The beta map Cactus has a ♥♥♥♥ing holes everywhere! It is also so monotone, I cringe when thinking valve could even put it in the game.    What they appear to think of the community: They take us for a bunch of clowns, juggling around in the circus with a red nose and wacky hair, riding on a one-wheel making ""toot toot sounds"". They put disclaimers on their ♥♥♥♥! ""For expert players only"" they write in captions under their new Pre-Access game mode. Who ever complained to them, that some game modes for too complicated? Someone with 0 neurons in their skull, succeeding at surpassing the stupidity of a pigeon?!? The game mode is just as ""complicated"" as the other game modes, there is nothing that could irritate new players, if you exclude all the unnecessary glitches.  Hats: As it worked in the past, adding more cosmetic items usually was endorsed with a lot of positive responses from the community, this was because they added fun cosmetics, while adding more content for gameplay. It was a balance of a innovation and fun, always the right mix. But now, they just try to make us suffocated in cosmetics.  This can be do to 2 reasons: 1. They just want to add more cosmetics to.. recreate Barbie simulator. 2. They realized that the game is dying and wana milk as much ♥♥♥♥ out of it as they can before it goes downhill (same thing goes for ducks)  Servers: I will try to keep this short.  Most Valve servers, the servers I personally enjoy playing on the most. Have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BETA maps on them. Most TF2 servers went from TF2 to DOTA 2 and CS:GO. I remember always finding at least 3 full servers of a single map, for each map a year or two ago. Now I have luck if I find a single full server of a map.  To end this: As I mentioned before; ""They realized that the game is dying and wanna milk as much ♥♥♥♥ out of it as they can before it goes downhill"", the game IS in fact actually going down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Look at all the TF2 youtubers! STAR_ and Jerma have stopped playing the game! Why? Because there is nothing new, and they have a bitter taste because of the recent decisions of Valve regarding TF2. ""So what if two youtubers quit playing the game, it happens all the time."" When a pretty much TF2 only channel with at least 90% of its subscribers being TF2 related, quits the game because the company is ♥♥♥♥ing up, then it is very obvious that there is something wrong! This is not just YouTube, it is also on my steam friends list, I used to see at least 10 people playing the game at any given time. Now it is rare to see anyone at all play it, and look at the size of that list! With the majority being hardcore TF2 Players. This game is dying and Valve needs to seriously step in before it bleeds out for good.			"

												First I time came across with TF2 was after I bought an Orange Box from the store, I was dying for HL2. Didn't know it was coming with this cartoon-like game called TF2, and interestingly I almost was going to ask Steam Support to remove this game from my game library after watching a clip on Youtube, seriously, I was like what the £€$$. But was too lazy for that. So time passes, looking to something new, I see this TF2 thingy again in my library, so whatever, let's download and give it a shot.Now, after a year, I wish I had submitted a ticket to Steam Support and got this thing removed from my account. Clocked 1000+ hours and I don't know where and how this will stop. There are two things you can't apparently clear, one is radioactive contamination the other one being addictive to TF2.Oh, and supposedly this game came free with Orange Box. Nice play, Valve, first fix is always free, isn't it? Team Fortress 2 Forever.			"

												Team Fortress 2 is quite a game with a history. Originally a pay-to-play game, Tf2 became free! Upon so the number of players skyrocketed.Team Fortress 2 is a game where Reliable Excavation Demolitions (RED) usually defends from onslaughts of Builders Leauge United (BLU). You, the player, are given the choice of 9 merchanaries. The fast, cocky and furious scout, the patriotic brawler soldier, the mysterious hellborn that is the pyro, the scumpy-drinking, one-eyed black cyclops demoman, the comical and brutually large heavy, the whimsical engineer, the funny german medic, the cool, calm and collected sniper and lastly the man who perfers brains over brawn, the spy.What makes this game so entertaining is that each of the 9 mercanaries that you can play as all have such a distinct personality, looks and playstyle. If you're a player who likes run-and-gun, Scout is for you. If you like big guns, Heavy calls your name. Stealth? Spy is already right behind you, waiting for you to play as him. Who can forget the loveable pyro who sets everything ablaze.This game is also very rewarding to both new and experienced player alike, as item drops are given not for getting a certain amount of kills, but for just playing the game!However if you want to truely experience the full greatness that is Tf2 I reccomend paying anywhere from 50 cents to $90 in the Mann Co. Store to get prenium so you can truely have a great feel for the game. However if money is tight or if you're not sure you'll enjoy this amazing game, you are not truely penalized for being a Free-to-Play, unlike most other games of this kind.Overall Team Fortress 2 is a great game that doesn't require a supercomputer, and I'd honestly reccomend this game to anybody who asks so.

I liked that the game has lots of diffrent maps so it never gets boring! I recommend this game to anyone who likes animated games and people who also like the game Half Life and Half Life 2.			"

												...My oh my how the mighty have fallen.I... love Team Fortress 2, I really do. If it wasn't for TF2, I would have spent a good year-ish on Xbox playing CoD or Minecraft or some crap instead of the 2007 TF2 that comes with the Console Orange Box. If it wasn't for Team Fortress 2 I wouldn't have gotten into Steam, let alone the beauty we know as PC gaming. Gaming is my... life? As sad as it sounds, it's the only thing I really do. Been gaming since I was like 5, haven't really found another hobby that stuck I guess. Now, I'm not gonna be one of those cancer af kids who says ""I wish it was 2007!!!!111!oneone!"" because I was FORCED to play it for a year, trust me, you don't want 2007. 2012-ish? Yeah ya want that. What was once a great, genre-defining game is now an abandonment of Valve, now too busy caring for CSGO (which they're dropping the ball with, I give it a good 3, maybe less, years until it falls off the face of the earth) and their cash-cow sugar momma DotA 2. Also they kinda run Steam so yeah.TF2's fall from grace comes from a lotta things. Greed, a horrid community (for f's sake just look at all the big YouTubers now, even THEY have drama) and rather... stale, gameplay. No new weapons, just more skins. No more maps, well, more maps, but years old community maps, just more unusual effects, cosmetics, a horrible economy, and a horrible way to ruin a game. As a casual shooter, you don't add matchmaking or competitive or appeal to the 2% of people who play UGC or whatever, you appeal to the majority.Valve isn't doing that.It disgusts me to play a competitive game and hear someone say ""lit 96"" like it's CSGO.It disgusts me to play a casual (in other words, not quick-play, we coulda just had casual AND quickplay, but alrite Valve) game and have everyone worry about ""OMG WIN SO I CAN LEVEL UP EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT GETTING ANYTHING FROM I JUST WANNA LOOK COOL MAN!""After 2,000 hours on PC, and probably a thousand+ more on console, I'm laying my TF2 career to rest. I used to bloody love this game, now I'm just gonna play Overwatch.Because, yaknow, Blizzard can maintain a f'ing game.Well.WoW is garbo now but...Shut up let me have this.			"

												This game is fascinating. I remember I tried playing it a year ago but I sucked ♥♥♥, so I gave up on it, even though I played for about fifteen minutes. I tried it again this year, because I read the reviews and everyone seemed so fascinated, claiming the game ruined your life because it completely consumed you, some people going as far as saying that something as simple as the whole hats deal was addictive. I'd laugh it off, thinking ""It can't be that bad"".After almost two months of playing, I can confirm; yeah, it's that bad. Perhaps worse.The first few weeks the liking was soft, I liked the game, the ""Meet the"" videos were amusing and really drew me to the game, but I was extremely bad at first, ""15 kills, 10 deaths"" type of bad. I dominated just one player every two rounds; and I even got really excited when I got a revenge (Jesus, it's embarrassing to admit). That's how bad, and even n00by I was. I was coming back to online PC gaming after six years of sticking to console, so that wasn't helping. But then, when I started playing a little bit more... when it was a domination after domination, when I'd become friends with my pocket Medics or the people I was a pocket Medic to... Life changed. This game literally consumed me. I wanted to use a portion of my birthday money to buy myself some cosmetics *just* for my Medic, make him beautiful ya'kno, and I ended up spending all of it in cosmetics for many of the classes. I'd stay up extremely late at night playing, sleep little, to then wake up early to play again. Now it's gotten to the point in which I've played 12 hours straight of TF2 with little rest in-between, two days ago it was *fourteen* hours. With a lot of effort I got up my ♥♥♥♥ to work out today just to not be too sedentary, and it was exasperating because I wanted to play. The game's just special like that, ya'know? It's fun. It's unique, creative. And I love the small details like the angry faces the classes make when they're shooting or fighting, the happy faces on the partner-taunts, the faces of agony when they're with low health; details like that make it special. And it's just generally very addictive.My point? This game is f*cking terrible. I don't give a cr*p if it's free, DON'T INSTALL IT. IT WILL CONSUME YOU AND RUIN YOU. F*CKING RUN. RUN WHILE YOU STILL CAN!!!!!!!! (I still recommend it, though. Just because you'll have a lot of fun)Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll get back to playing.			"

												Have you ever had the craving to buy a strange weapon then spend all day leveling it up so your friends think you are cool?Then this is the best game for you! First job, get a strange either by wasting your money on uncrating, crafting all your hard found weapons to buy a strange from the overpriced scumbags on Tf2.Outpost, or better yet be a scumbag yourself and scam a newcomer who has just had this misfortune to uncrate and give him/her a scrap for his/her recently unboxed strange. Step two, locate a strange level up sever don't worry they are very easy to find due to the sheer amount of people wanting to level up their stranges so badly. And final step go and kill some idle people on the strange level up sever. Now all your friends/eniemes will think next time you kill them WOW they got 16854972 kills in one day? Defiently didn't go on a strange level up sever. 10/10 Best game			"

												Being an old school player of the Fortress genre I have completely fell in love with the way TeamFortress2 handles now. I was here during beta / Launch and experienced the first year and realized it was good but needed more time. I took 5 yrs away came back and the game is 100% amazing and probably one of the best Free 2 Play games out!CPU specs can be sub par and still playable and the overall community is generally nice/ friendly.

												Great F2P game.I have had alot of fun playing this game over the years. I believe I first played on xbox when The Orange Box came out. That was stolen before I could really enjoy much since I was moving and someone broke into my storage. I started playing on Steam once I got back into playing PC games and saw it was f2p. I did end up getting a copy of The Orange Box on here which made trading in-game items available as well as selling the market for some things.I really enjoy the big events like Halloween and how they have special maps and items every year. The last few years new event items have not been tradable which kind of sucks since they were lots of fun for trading and selling to get cooler things or things you couldn't seem to get no matter how much you played.I definitely recommend playing and buying something cheap in-game to unlock trading and selling items.The game is like a cartoonish Counter-Strike and so much fun is to be had especially with friends and good strangers.

												Man I miss this game... Real shame as to what happened to it.1.4k hours, may seem like a lot but it's childs play to a game that's been out for nearly 10 years now.Valve has all but abandoned the game, handing it over to the ""competitive"" community members for balance while trying to pull revenue from it in the same way they do with CS:GO. Queue times are horrendus and it doesn't look like it's going to change.This USED to be a game where you could hop into a game, and mindlessly meander about, doing whatever you want. You could trade, play go-carts on old maps, fight Saxton Hale, or just Pubstomp with friends. Now you cant due to: A collapsing economy, dead community servers, MLP models replacing Saxton Hale/kids, and the boring MM system.Nowadays it's free CS:GO with hats.I miss the old TF2.			"

												This new update has completely removed the idea of senseless fun.Before this update you felt free to leave and join public matches as many times as you wanted, switching teams if you made friends with an enemy player or simply if your team is doing badly, you were not committed to anything.. which is the whole reason people played Team Fortresss 2.Now valve have twisted the idea of casual matchmaking and turned it into something which is extremely tedious and stressful to play. You are now unable to switch teams, kick hackers and you are bound to a game that you may not want to play 20 minutes in, and if you leave you get a COOLDOWN!? For me team fortress is a time passer, a game that does not require much effort to play that I can leave when I wish.. not a game I get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at.Please Valve, make this new casual thing optional, don't forcefeed your bad ideas down our throats.on a side note, I never thought I would say this.. but I miss autobalance, I want autobalance, I need autobalance.

												Dont get me wrong.. This is great game if youre lookin for FPS f2p game to play with your friends.. Its really fun and sht BUT! There are just small details thats bothering me and this HUGE update that came out today.. Ive been waiting so long, patiently watching incoming updates, changes, but this last update was also last nail in coffin called team fortress 2 (atleast for me). Only thing you can do now.. is funeral... Small details such as dsync.. terrible feedback.. literally useless weapons, weapon skins that looks like pure sht.. I could continue but if youre new to the game you probably wont register. Now this Meet your match update. It is possible to be changed in future but right now its forcing you to play random map  and random mod with ofc random people and since everyone is unranked you can get players with hunderts.. even thousands hours with players with barelly 10h gameplay wich according to volvo is same ""skill"" as you.. Also youll get XP just for win and win only. Got bunch of kills? Doesnt matter. Valuable medic? Doesnt matter. You were only one with your friend who actually did something in game? Doesnt matter, you wont get sht. So far, nobody is takin it seriously.. Just few people.. long story short: if you want to play this for fun.. its great. But if you will try to take this game seriously, you will fail, in csgo you can atleast filter wich maps you want to join in compet okay.. but not here... yeah and no pubs.. so i guess im done with this game.. shame.. i really liked it.. Edit: i was reading some reviews from this date.. and honestly its making me so sad that dedicated fans with thousands of hours literally.. are just leaving..			"

												This new update has completely removed the idea of senseless fun.Before this update you felt free to leave and join public matches as many times as you wanted, switching teams if you made friends with an enemy player or simply if your team is doing badly, you were not committed to anything.. which is the whole reason people played Team Fortresss 2.Now valve have twisted the idea of casual matchmaking and turned it into something which is extremely tedious and stressful to play. You are now unable to switch teams, kick hackers and you are bound to a game that you may not want to play 20 minutes in, and if you leave you get a COOLDOWN!? For me team fortress is a time passer, a game that does not require much effort to play that I can leave when I wish.. not a game I get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at.Please Valve, make this new casual thing optional, don't forcefeed your bad ideas down our throats.on a side note, I never thought I would say this.. but I miss autobalance, I want autobalance, I need autobalance.

												I've been playing this game for six years on and off. It was awesome in the beginning, the community was nice, the gameplay was entertaining. Now, with Meet your Match, if you get stuck on the one team that is losing, may whatever deity you worship have mercy on your soul because you can't switch teams anymore.Balanced teams happen once in a blue moon, classes and weapons are getting buffed/nerfed at random for reasons only Valve knows, the only new content being added is made by the community (in some rare occasions by Valve and when it is it seems to be pretty terrible, just look at the Carlton taunt, no music! They made music for the conga, the kazotsky kick and the mannrobics, why can't they make a new song for the Carlton taunt ? Do you have any idea how awkward it is to dance without music ?), new weapons happen once every few years and the community's become stressed, displeased, tired and demotivated.If you want a game where fun is the main element, TF2 is definetly not the War-themed hat simulator you're looking for (unless you're the kind of person who enjoys ruining another's day for their own enjoyment).My opinion about this game will remain the same until Valve actually does anything good for the community and the game.

												Team Fortresss 2 is a great firstperson multiplayer shooter with 9 different classes to play as. They all have a playstyle for themselfs, and unique in their way. There is a lot to learn, from the many different playstyles, and how you play the classes.I've spent a lot of hours on this game, yet I'm not even close to stop playing. Got lots of friends to play with in it, and still as charming as when I started to play it!			"

												Great game. There are quite a few glitches after big updates, but its still a good game. This game ruins people, these hats ruin people. I recommend any new person coming into tf2 to NOT focus on hats or the economy, most of you will and you WILL REGRET it. Just trust me, there is way to much price manipulation going on. And if you do get into hats DO NOT get into unusuals. They will make you question everything you've ever done. Just dont do it. Dont go to the hat side. Anyways, just based on the game (not hats) i'll give this game a 10/10 will swag again.			"

Now you cant join into a map you want. Now you have to wait to search matches. Awful just awful. Valve please stop it! Remove the freaking update, or we will start riot.

												This is the game that got me into PC Gaming. I played cereal box doom reskins/point and click, and flash games before but TF2 was my first real PC game that got me into Steam and everything else PC. I found the boxed version, back when you had to pay for it, on my friends floor and he gave it to me because it didn't work for his Mac at the time. Hence the key activation tag up in the top right^ if you're viewing this on the store page.I started playing back in 2011 and got sucked into the trading scene. There's been a lot of changes but it will always have me coming back. There's nothing that's comparable for me, it will always be my favorite game.♥			"

												Team Fortress 2 is a fantastic multi-player online first person shooter with 9 classes that all have unique personalities. Each class uses a primary, secondary and melee weapon.The Heavy has the most health, takes a while to fire, but can do the most damage per second with no reloading, but he moves slowly. The soldier shoots rockets, has the 2nd most health and and is the 2nd slowest, but experienced players can rocket jump. The demoman is a defender, using stickybombs to lay traps and grenades to roll forward, he can sticky jump with some practice and can also be a proficient melee class. The Pyro is a defender, lighting enemies on fire, causing damage for an amount of time, air blasting projectiles away and bringing good cheer and derpiness to any team. Engineers build teleporters, sentry guns and dispensers to defend the team and keep them healthy and supplied with ammo. The spy is elusive and backstabs people while invisible cloaking or disguising himself. His sapper can also disable and destroy the engineer's buildings. The scout runs fast with a double jump and shotguns people, he also captures at twice the speed of anyone else. Snipers snipe from far away. Medics heal and make people invincible at times. As for the modes, there are traditional capture the flag, king of the hill and less traditional payload, where blue team will push a moving cart, while red team defends it. The more blue players next to the cart, the faster it will go. If a red player is next to the cart, it stops moving. It is a great dynamic that makes the game really stand out above the rest. There is also payload race, where two teams push their carts, and control points where the goal is to capture all of the points (3 or 5 points instead of just 1 like King of the Hill). Teams for both modes are mostly 12 vs 12. Each mode has quite a few maps and maps are continually added over time.The newest mode is Mann vs Machine, where six players take on wave after wave of robots. There is a free version of Mann vs Machine called Boot Camp and a non free version called Mann Up that costs a Tour of Duty Ticket ($1 in the store). The ticket gets used if you complete a MVM mission. If you don't complete a mission, or if you complete a mission you've already completed, then you keep the ticket. A Mann vs Machine tour is composed of several missions across a few maps. What do you get for completing a tour? A random strange weapon and a notch in your belt!The maps in Team Fortress 2 stand out for their paths, there isn't just one path through each map, but there are usually several routes to get around a herd of foes.  There is a lot of joy and satisfaction flanking opponents and killing an entire team from behind.Sure this game is free to play, but there are a lot of things to buy for real money! Hats for $5, keys for $2.50. Keys are like legalized gambling, you buy a key to open a crate, if you don't get what you want, you can always use Steam trade to trade the item for something you do want or just use another key! There is a whole micro economy in the game with trading. The game will drop you weapons as you play, then you can craft two weapons together to make metal. 18 weapons will make you a refined metal. That's the basic free currency of the game. When you have three refine, you can craft them together for a random hat. Most people prefer to trade their refined for keys, but well refined metal will always generate from dropped weapons, keys will always cost $2.50. You can also buy and sell keys in the Steam market for Steam wallet money to buy Steam games.The items you pay for are cosmetic if not strange weapons that count your kills. So it is not pay to win, even though you can buy in game weapons, but every weapon is a side-grade, not an upgrade, with pros and cons to each weapon. Since this is a multi-player game, nothing will overpower you. It is all rock-paper-scissors. Heavy can kill anything, but a spy or sniper can take out a heavy. A pyro can easily take out a spy. Stuff like that.Team Fortress 2 is updated regularly and has implemented a lot of community created items, maps and Halloween events. The Halloween events feel pretty special, but for the most part, they're just Halloween versions of normal maps. The community items, while cool, seem to be mostly cosmetic items with a few new weapons. There have been community maps made and maps are always free to play on.It is an exceptional game. Diverse weapons, maps and it is buckets of fun and free to play!!!! FREE!!! You get weapons dropped to you over time or you can trade them. It is such a good game even if you're like me and hate multiplayer this is fun multiplayer! Or single player against bots! It is a must play for any fan of first person shooters. The game is smooth, the 9 characters and weapons are very balanced and very different. There is a diverse array of modes.			"

												EDIT: To all the people who are complaining about the new update, you wanted a new update, you got it. So what, a couple of skins, some crates, and some fresh gameplay mechanics, big deal. Leave your negative reviews to yourself, no one cares.===================================================================Team Fortress 2, here I go. Looking for a game that's free to play, a first person shooter, and down right fun as hell? Well, you've come to the right game! All 9 classes add for a diverse choice of playing styles, but that's only part of it. Weapons, lots of extra weapons. The large universe of weapons can assist you in your play style or just change it completely (I'm looking at you, gunslinger). The large selection of weapons allow for a diverse and quite unique experience for the first person shooter genre, and there's still not something that can match up to this game. But, the main reason most people play Team Fortress 2 is for it's 1 of a kind trading system. While is is sometimes unrelliable, trade servers and all, Team Fortress's 2 trading system is a game changer. You can trade hats, miscs, and weapons, and trust me, you're better off having hats, because in this game, your generally considered ""a better player"" for having loads of hats and unusuals. Ah! Unusuals, almost forgot about those things. Unusuals are basically hats with special effects like flames or a snow cloud over your head or on your head. They are obtained through purchasing Mann Co. Supply Crate Keys (and many more types of keys) from the Mann. Co Store or the Steam Market or other sources, and using them to unbox a crate that corresponds with that specific key, generally reffered to unboxing or un-crating. Players have a very rare chance to unbox these ""Unusuals"", but when you do, consider yourself ""Done with trading"" (unless you unbox a less valuable unusual). That's Team Fortress 2 in a LONG Nutshell. I'm SuperOnlineGamer, and I approve of this game! "

												TF2 used to have charm. It used to be great. With the matchmaking update, it's just a bad clone of overwatch.			"

												I really appreciate this game for many reasons, but the primary one is that it recognizes its own absurdity. Not only that, but it embraces it and builds upon it.			"

												Team Fortress 2 is the pinnacle of artistic expression in video games. I can think of no better artistic representation of the failure man has made out of civilization than the Heavy Weapons Guy. Think about it for a second. He's morbidly obese, a communist, and requires no natural ability to use effectively. I also like how the most-fragile class, the Spy, is French. Highly recommended			"

												I love this game so much that 7 years after its launch, I spent over 3 months of sweat and first-world hard labor to put together a love letter in video form:""Why Team Fortress 2 is STILL my favorite FPS in 2015""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5woXxmTwH8There's no class-based FPS that combines hilarious and genuine character with unending gib-fests and an unstoppably addicting skill-ceiling for every playstyle the way Team Fortress 2 does. I'm not sure when I'll stop playing TF2 for good, but it won't be anytime soon.My original review from May 22, 2011:I stopped playing StarCraft II an hour into it's launch-day premiere so I could play a (then) three-and-a-half year old game I've never quit loving: I had to get my Team Fortress 2 fix.If that doesn't tell you anything about this game, I don't know what will.Launch after launch I play new games—that cost 5 times what TF2 cost me—and I enjoy 'em like anyone else, but at the end of the day, I get bored of the lot and find myself back in the action of this chaotic masterpiece. Team Fortress 2 has been a constant source of entertainment and skill-sharpening throughout the years, and--in all honesty--I just wouldn't call myself a PC gamer without owning this hilarious, bloody gem.
