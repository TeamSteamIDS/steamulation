												The best and only true Co-op mod for Half-Life 2's. It is little bit buggy, but aside of that having friend next to you bugs dosen't really matter. You are more likely to laugh to them than raging over them. I highly recommend this to people who are reaching together with friend for fun co-op experience that is of course Synergy.			"

												Well/\........I dont know where to begin......this game is the symbol of anarchy....if you have half life 2 GET THIS GAME.  Synergy is a game about just playing half life with your friends, but no, its not even that.  IT IS CHAOS IN A GAME.  First time I played this I was in a game with 16 players.  Mainly it was about getting to the end of the level as fast as possible doing whatever it takes.  Its not as easy as you think though, YOU WILL DIE MANY TIMES. Me and a few random players started rushing through the game, if we met a antlion guard, we would beat it down with crowbars then fire rockets at it.  We would cover the map in our own sprays while spamming mics and killing ourselves.  Running full-steam ahead into a pile of combine and all of us dueling out with crowbars.  Out of all of it my favorite map would be Highway 17 or Nova Prospect.  The only problem I have with this game is how Hectic it is, Even though its fun at times it can still be horrible trying to walk across a single plank without being pushed off, or lose your partner and attacked by a horde of Zombbombs. Also the crashing os horrible ;(.   Extras:Wanna good song to listen to while playing? Sonic X theme song                                                                             Also the community is derranged: One server at night I went in had 7 guys                                                                                         and 3 women talking about politics while attacking Combine.                                                                             Another one had a bunch of kids crying over getting killed XD                             10/10 STILL PLAYING AGAIN			"

												When 15 of the one and only Gordan Freeman run into a hallway and simultaneously get whacked unconcious by the same cop, you know it's gonna be a good game.  You start your journey by cooperatively breaking the mini teleporter in Kleiner's  lab faster than a 10 year old on xbox live can realize when his internet has just cut out.  Proceed to race your fellow chums to numerous respawning copies of the same laser mounted airboat before you have to wait in line with nothing but the sound your crowbar makes when it hits other players to entertain yourself.  Stomp all over that antlion awaking sand because you brought an army this time and no one gives a ♥♥♥♥ about whether or not that rebel loser's friend is gonna get killed due to your lack of self reserve.  Get vaporized at least 50 times in the combine elevators from violent swarms of electric balls launched by your cackling comrades.  Lastly, break the shock and awe that resides in the silence of the game's final, time stopping, life endangering, jaw dropping, moments with a subtle ""sometimes I dream about cheese"" sounded off by using your keen dialogue wheel.  99/10, A player took out a whole server with an explosive barrel and followed it up by singing the national anthem.

												Half Life 2 and GTA: San Andreas have a few things in common - they're both single player, they were both released in 2004, they're two of the best games ever made, but best of all: they both had communities which were technically capable of creating multiplayer experiences. GTA SA has Multi Theft Auto and HL2 has Synergy!As well as being able to experience the whole HL2 story with your friends you're able to play a variety of other co-operative maps and you can even make one yourself with Hammer. Like any modification though, Synergy is not perfect. Server stability was bad and there are some annoying bugs like not being able to pickup ammo. But these problems won't stop you from experiencing a co-operative HL2 campaign.			"

												I feel like people in this game who reviewed it, did it with obvious hollow bias. Most of the reviews say ""It's good, I can play with friends"" and such, but none of them go into detail of the games current state.For starters, the community is practically dead. You'll only find about 50+ servers, with a total of about 12 people, the most in one place you'll find is 2 or 3. Even Sven Coop, the game's predecessor, has far more people playing.The developer has Soon™ syndrome. Yes, I know he's working on Black Mesa Source and other games, I'm not bashing him. But I’ve seen it several times on the forums where he promises an update, only for it to never be announced. The last time he said anything publicly outside of the forums was May 28th, 2015. It's been over a year since content has been updated.Combine are insanely overpowered; Weapons have been nerfed. The SMG1 is the most notable. In HL2, you could take the SMG 1 most of the game and it would do. In Synergy, the SMG1 is a pea shooter that can barely kill metro police. The Combine have been mega buffed; they take forever to kill (Even with the new LMG). They'll gun you down in seconds and you'll even be lucky if you manage to harm one considerably.Most of the built in maps are outdated and near impossible to beat since there is no checkpoints. You die, that's it. No setting can change that. Since the maps aren't built around the Combine Weapons changes, you'll be lucky if you even get past any level with combine.The modding community is scarce, barely any mods and they're not very diverse. You can't add player models unless you're a donor, and the only way you can become a donor is if you donate, but you have to wait until the next update for perks. And with a developer suffering Soon™ Syndrome, the approximate time you'd get perks is between now and when Half Life 3 is released. Most of the mods were ripped or stolen directly from Gamebannana, and you could easily make your own just by renaming a few files and swapping things around and then just plopping it in the custom folder like it's nothing.I'm not trying to stomach punch the game or the developer. But people should know the truth instead of hearing the bias in these recent reviews. All I see is ""The game is gud I can ply with friendz"" or generic copy pasta. I hope this game gets revised and revived somehow, at some point. Because if the games predecessor, Sven-coop is doing better than its successor, then there's quite an issue, isn't there? If you really want a source engine coop game, I'd suggest Obsidian Conflict. Sven-coop if you're on a potato.			"

(or lan multiplayer clients if you're into that kinda thing) Playing Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2 Episode One, and Half-Life 2 Episode Two, etc etc, is AMAZINGLY fun with good friends.It'll bring you the joy you had when you played Half-Life 2 for the first time all over again, every single time!If you like Half-Life 2 and coop games, this is DEFINITELY the mod for you!And it's free if you have Half-Life 2, so what are you waiting for!?

												The best thing about this game is that you can play a good number of single-player Half-Life 2 mods in co-op. There’s 7 mods with built-in support (Calamity, City 7: Toronto Conflict. Dangerous World, MINERVA: Metastasis, Offshore, Riot Act, Rock 24) and a lot of unofficial mod supports you can get from the workshop (22 as of April 2017). Check out the complete list here: 


Mod Supports 

By: Balimbanana

			Mod Supports are collections of map edits and content loaders for being able to play Source Mods co-op. This list will be updated with any new mod supports.		


If you find the game too hard or too easy, you can adjust the difficulty by changing some server variables in skill_mod.cfg. For example, if you set sk_dmg_take_scale3 to 2.5 and sk_dmg_inflict_scale3 to 1, the enemies will be very dangerous, but at the same time not spongy.Turn off player respawns (mp_respawndelay 0) and you’ve got yourself a hardcore survival game somewhat similar to No More Room in Hell or Left 4 Dead on Expert.

												Synergy is not a game, it is a brilliant way of satisfying a human's need for social interaction with friends. Now players can play one of the best Source games to date with friends, and it's completely free if you already own the HL2 base game, or multiple other source games. And it's not just regular old HL2. This is remastered, with weapons that were planned but never released for the final game, new mechanics, and plenty of hilarity where cheats are involved. Have you ever wanted to fly on top of cliffs and skip portions of the game? With the right server you can do that. Have you ever wanted to drive an 8-seated truck and have all your friends do drive-bys on CPs? With the right server, you can do that.My final rating for this mod is a 9.89/10 on the richter scale to the 8th power divided by the square root of 3.8. Yeah, it's that good.			"

												This mod is what many half life players have wanted for years. 9/10.The second half life online game is what I have wanted to do with my friends for a very long time, but it did not exist. So you can imagine how happy I was when my mates told me about this.The games brother (Sven) is extremely addictive; The same can be said about this.Synergy does have speed runners like Sven which is the main disadvantage. But this can be prevented by hosting a server with your friends.One last thing would be that almost every server has custom music that can be triggered by any player at any moment. This means it gets spammed over and over until you go mad and have to leave the server, which really gets on my nerves.This is a 9/10			"

												Half-Life 2 is fun itself, and I enjoyed watching people play it and I also enjoyed playing it myself. But something like this mod is what I have always been waiting for because it allows you to play with others. Half-Life 2 always seemed like a game that you never really played alone, you either played with someone watching you, or you watched someone else play. Synergy adds the teamwork Half-Life 2 always seemed to almost need.Pros-You can play with other people either locally or internationally-You can customize your experience with community made mods that replace the weapons and other things in the workshop (I prefer not to, but it is nice  to be able to.)-Ravenholm is less scary with others.-Custom maps and built in coop maps.-Works with Half-Life 2, and it's two following episodes.-Extra supplies because there are more players. ( only good if there are more players )-Two seated buggy, and other drivable vehicles with even more seats.-A few added weapons.-You can play in a squad fashion without npcs.-You can heal  others and give others ammo.-You can drop weapons if someone is lacking.-Teammate glows behind walls-Selectable playermodels (You can subscribe to a Gordon Freeman model in the workshop)Cons-Sometimes, there are too many enemies, but that is understandable because there are more players.-Enemies deal way more damage and can take more damage. (Also slightly good, because you have to be a little strategic, but it makes the easy difficulty misleading and there should be an option for classic or synergy enemy quantity, health, and damage.)-Lower ammo limits.-Sometimes spawn without a gravity gun.-Rarely spawn without a suit.-Not all vehicles have multiple seats (Airboat and Jalopy)Reccommended features to add:-If it is detected that you cannot move, you can teleport to a teammate. (I don't know how that would be done)-Takedowns (Would spice things up a bit especially if you happen to be behind an oblivious combine soldier, or if a fast zombie thought it could charge you and get away with it that easy.)-Secrets (Would also spice things up. I know there are already secret supplies, but maybe a secret message or secret rooms)-Incapacitation and revival from others. (Requires health from health pool)-Rare Combine Shield (Can rarely be found and equipped to use like a riot shield, but is limited to one person which could take on the role of leader.)It's a mod that let's you play with other people and it's free, I'm not sure if it gets better than that. It has definitely changed my gaming experience.			"

												Wow, never knew how much fun I could have with random strangers playing a game that's meant to only be singleplayer. I spent about 12 hours playing through Half Life 2, then Episode 1, then Episode 2 (currently my time says 11, but Steam went down about 5 times during the whole thing) and it originally started out with me and a friend just playing around in the very beginning of the game. By the time we got to Route Kanal (or whatever the chapter is that you get the airboat) the server already had 10/10 players. Over time people came and go, but we still had fun. WHen we got to Episode 2, we had a group called ""The Originals"" which was the people who had been on since the first Half Life 2. I made about 6 friends that day, and one of them even bought then installed Episode 1 just so he could continue to play the game with us. THis is one of my favorite mods around and I hope to have more fun in time.Edit: I also ended up getting an hour of sleep before waking up and violently puking. Worth it.			"

												WOAH, I almost forgot to review this game. This is Synergy and it is also a Half-Life 2 MOD and no it does not come with the HL2 Content SO you need to buy Half-Life 2 first. Do I enjoy this game? Yes but I want to ask you something now. Was HL2 or any other HL2 Mod REALLY hard with 1 person? That my friend is why they made this a CO-OP version of HL2. It supports HL2, HL2 EP1 and HL2 EP2 IT EVEN WORKS WITH MINERVA: METASTASIS. Which all 4 of those are REALLY fast paced action and sci fi games. So why not give this game a try. It has a Steam Workshop and it is really fun I think you might actually enjoy this game. I give this game a rating of 9/10 It could use some work on the difficulty on the maps that are bundled with this game but I think that really that is the only problem with this game.			"

												If you love playing Half-Life and co-op as much as I do then this is the free piece of software to bond them together!  Half-Life 2 is great playing with friends.  Synergy enables Half-Life 2 to be played co-op.  Here is what I did to get it working.Enjoy!!Playing Half-Life 2 co-op using SynergyBoth game host and client:Download and install Half-Life 2:Download and install Synergy (free):Game host:1) Open port 27015 TCP and UDP on your router2) Get your REAL internet IP address (shown at the bottom left hand corner) and give this number to the client joining your game:http://www.speedtest.net/3) Start up Synergy4) Start server for Half-Life 2 from the Synergy menu optionsNote: Them trying to join your game via Steam friends or sending them game invites will NOT work. It will try connecting to the actual IP address of your PC (usually 192.168.x.x) which is local and not public. You will get host connect failures. Client:1) Start Synergy2) Enable Developer Console:The console starts disabled by default. To enable it, load the game and visit Options > Keyboard > Advanced. There will be a pop-up that will include two options, one of them labeled ""Enable Developer Console"". Once enabled, it can be opened and closed by pressing the button above Tab ⇆, known as the ""tilde."" ~3) Enter Developer Console with the ~ key and enter connect command to the host internet IP address:~ connect xx.xx.xx.xxYou then should be connected and able to play co-op!

												It's a lot of fun to replay the HL:2 series with friends as well as strangers. It's like playing it all over again in a new way. Nobody gets left behind because there is a required amount of people before it will progress to the next level, depending on the amount of people present in the game. My only gripe (a major one) is that there is hardly ever someone actually playing the game. I resort to having to play with Steam friends, which isn't a problem. But if they arn't online, good luck finding a game with more than 2 afk people. Great game/mod, highly recommended if you havn't played HL2 in a while!			"

The only thing I have difficulty with is getting my friend to connect to my server via internet. We can connect just fine on LAN, but not WAN. Still, being able to go through Ravenholm, or drive along the beach (also in any vehicle you find) is still awesome with friends.			"

												This software is really uselful and it's a load of fun to play with your firends. There may some glitches, since HL2 wasn't meant to be a multiplayer game at all. So you MIGHT need to noclip a few areas. Don't worry about dying either, because you can respawn if atleast one player is alive. And the best part is the two vehicles you get in the game are both duplicated so that all of you can ride them, which i found to be very intersting. I would clearly recommend evryone to try it, and if you need to play JUST with your friends, you can either create a virtual LAN or download the dedicated server tool.A very useful and entertaining mod, but if you played HL2 first, it'll keep you prepared.

												For those avid HL2 fans out there, I must reccomend Synergy on a raised level. Relive the dramatic and action-installed story of Half-Life, but no longer are you alone as Dr. Gordon Freeman; have a buddy or group of online friends by your side, and together, reconquer the combine in epic battles with tales to tell. And after you've (hopefully) defeated Dr. Breen in HL2, you can move on to HL2:Ep1, HL2:Ep2, and... well... I'm pretty sure it ends there, right? Wait- Synergy... multiple people, possibly 2 including you... add the amount of HL2 games... that's 5. Then, subtract 2, becuase this is only compatible in HL2... AH HA! Half-Life 3 confirmed! But seriously, just get this mod. I can say, I've had quite a lot of fun with it, and no doubt, you will too! (Oh, and do look over your list and be quite sure you own all of the games you wish to play with this mod; you're not getting a free-ride through a mod, you bloody bugger!)			"

												When 15 of the one and only Gordan Freeman run into a hallway and simultaneously get whacked unconcious by the same cop, you know it's gonna be a good game. You start your journey by cooperatively breaking the mini teleporter in Kleiner's lab faster than a 10 year old on xbox live can realize when his internet has just cut out. Proceed to race your fellow chums to numerous respawning copies of the same laser mounted airboat before you have to wait in line with nothing but the sound your crowbar makes when it hits other players to entertain yourself. Stomp all over that antlion awaking sand because you brought an army this time and no one gives a ♥♥♥♥ about whether or not that rebel loser's friend is gonna get killed due to your lack of self reserve. Get vaporized at least 50 times in the combine elevators from violent swarms of electric balls launched by your cackling comrades. Lastly, break the shock and awe that resides in the silence of the game's final, time stopping, life endangering, jaw dropping, moments with a subtle ""sometimes I dream about cheese"" sounded off by using your keen dialogue wheel. 99/10			"

												Synergy is one of those little Source mods that can really add a lot of replayability to Half-Life 2. Synergy is simple in what it does - you can play through Half-Life 2 with up to 4(?) friends, but tweaking the maxplayers cvar lets you go up to 16. But that's not all for Synergy. The community have created all sorts of maps for this little mod, most of them being incredibly difficult co-op minigames or objective maps. There are also physics-based puzzle maps where you have your wits and your gravity gun to complete usually around 20 puzzles per map. All of these custom map types are very fun to play, and take Synergy from a co-op Half-Life 2 experience to virtually it's own game. Unfortunately, Synergy hasn't aged well - the server list is very sparsely populated, and there are only a few servers remaining that have any sort of active player base.With that said, if you can get a group of friends together and grab some of the custom-made coop maps, you can have a blast with Synergy. (Quite litteraly, friendly fire is a thing that is toggleable)			"

												Let's get the story straight. Everyone loves to play together. Half-Life 2 is a great experience to go through by yourself. To play as a character like Gordon Freeman, awake and alive, never selling his soul... In Synergy you are not alone. It's fun to mess around with your friends, while you make your way to the end of the game. I played with a friend. You can play on public servers, or make your own. This can be pretty difficult, cause you need to open some ports. There are guides for that.The game is free! :D You just need Half-Life 2, as a minimum. You can go through the Episodes as well. So why not give it a try?			"

												short:watching out for headhumpers with friends 10/10long: when i first found out about half life 2 (after playing half life 1 of course) i allways felt that there should have been a multiplayer campain.....that was when i met synergythe mod itself it awesome! but even though i love this mod it still has a few downsides but first! lets get to the good sidesprosthe game has more weapons and instead of the jalopy and the buggy you can also drive things that would work in the original hl2 but you could not drive them such as the truckhas its own workshop meaning you can have combine soldiers replaced with stormtroopersits not only the hl2 campain you play you can also play campains like....nightmare house 2minervaand prospekt (maybe?)consmost of the synergy maps reqiure ep1 and ep2you need hl2 for this to work (meaning you need to download the original hl2 just to download this)the dedicated synergy server tool does not seem to work (that could be for only me though)but all in all this mod is really fun and bring some friends to!that is if they own hl2			"

												This is a great game and I hope that everyone I know will get it, the servers are very lonely at the moment, and I'd really like to play the Half Life 2 and the episodes with other people.I loved some of the plugins people had, like huge vehicles (once we got a van in the Highway 17 chapter and we dubbed it the 'Party Van'), more guns, even chat sounds! It was amazing when it was up, hopefully people will start playing again.I rate this game a 7.5/10 as there are still a few errors, for instance episode 1 rarely works, and episode 2 crashes the game at the very end of the strider battle just before T-Minus One begins.

												HL2 Co-op in a nutshell, folks. Have HL2, and so does your friend? WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR! STOP READING THIS AND PLAY WITH HIM/HER!Ok... you still reading? You must be like me then. Ok, onto specific details.So blah blah blah HL2 co-op, yeah yeah yeah BUT WAIT! NEW STUFF! What's this? A Pipewrench? This is not in HL2 at all! OF COURSE NOT SILLY! IT'S A MOD WITH NEW THINGS! Oh and what's this? A Desert Eagle? Looks like it's from CS:S! It IS from CS:S! But with new animations... wait, no... not new... *modified animations. Hey it's better than nothing, am I right? Seems powerful... wait... it only uses 20 bullets... -_- Oh well, again, better than nothing right? OH WAIT WHAT IS THIS! IS THAT, IT IS! It's a MP5k! It's also new! Seems so useful too... powerful, but 15 bullets less than the MP9 you have in HL2. Oh look, new maps! I want to try these out! OH NO WAIT IT'S A DARK HEADCRAB GET ME AWAY *Loud Scream*. *Dissconect*...My reaction to one of the maps. (Only I didn't scream, I jumped. I am manly! (Not really))So, you still wanting more? Fine, I'll add the Pros and Cons. (As usual)PROS:1. Co-op, where else are you gonna find a Source Co-op game that has to do with HL2?2. Looks like it runs on a new Source engine... reminds me of the engine BM:S uses.3. So much fun... just play it.4. Tweaked maps that the creator(s) did.5. New weapons. Seriously, you can't go wrong with that.CONS:1. Sometimes buggy, like the first level (the trainstation), where you can't go up the ladder and jump out the window. Much much bugs, but that's what you have to deal with.2. Wish there was a Gordon Freeman model... oh well, I can wait for Sven Co-Op 2 to come out.3. Very Hard, that's why you have friends!4. Can't think of anything else.All in all, I give it a 9/10. Yes there are bugs, plus it's hard. But all in all, it's a great game. It puts that smile on you when you are sad and want to play with friends.Hope this review helped!			"

			Dan and I play the Synergy mod for Half Life 2. It was pretty tough getting it to work because of port forwarding, Steam ticket ID errors and ambiguous connecting methods.

												Its nice, you can get new vehicles suchs as the van and the truck and the two seat car. The van comes in a variety of colors.   You can get guns such as the mp5 and a mounted turret gun that is hold-able. Over all servers are easy to make or get on and it is very action packed and exciting.			"

												HL2 Co-op in a nutshell, folks. Have HL2, and so does your friend? WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR! STOP READING THIS AND PLAY WITH HIM/HER!Ok... you still reading? You must be like me then. Ok, onto specific details.So blah blah blah HL2 co-op, yeah yeah yeah BUT WAIT! NEW STUFF! What's this? A Pipewrench? This is not in HL2 at all! OF COURSE NOT SILLY! IT'S A MOD WITH NEW THINGS! Oh and what's this? A Desert Eagle? Looks like it's from CS:S! It IS from CS:S! But with new animations... wait, no... not new... *modified animations. Hey it's better than nothing, am I right? Seems powerful... wait... it only uses 20 bullets... -_- Oh well, again, better than nothing right? OH WAIT WHAT IS THIS! IS THAT, IT IS! It's a MP5k! It's also new! Seems so useful too... powerful, but 15 bullets less than the MP9 you have in HL2. Oh look, new maps! I want to try these out! OH NO WAIT IT'S A DARK HEADCRAB GET ME AWAY *Loud Scream*. *Dissconect*...My reaction to one of the maps. (Only I didn't scream, I jumped. I am manly! (Not really))So, you still wanting more? Fine, I'll add the Pros and Cons. (As usual)PROS:1. Co-op, where else are you gonna find a Source Co-op game that has to do with HL2?2. Looks like it runs on a new Source engine... reminds me of the engine BM:S uses.3. So much fun... just play it.4. Tweaked maps that the creator(s) did.5. New weapons. Seriously, you can't go wrong with that.CONS:1. Sometimes buggy, like the first level (the trainstation), where you can't go up the ladder and jump out the window. Much much bugs, but that's what you have to deal with.2. Wish there was a Gordon Freeman model... oh well, I can wait for Sven Co-Op 2 to come out.3. Very Hard, that's why you have friends!4. Can't think of anything else.All in all, I give it a 9/10. Yes there are bugs, plus it's hard. But all in all, it's a great game. It puts that smile on you when you are sad and want to play with friends.Hope this review helped!			"

												Best. Half-Life 2. Mod. On. Steam. HANDS DOWN.This mod adds cooperative multiplayer support, while trying to retain the Half-Life 2-like experience. It not only adds coop support for the levels of Half-Life 2, but it also adds coop support for Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Half-Life 2: Lost Coast, MINERVA(: Metastasis), Dangerous World, Calamity, Rock 24, Riot Act: Part I, City 7: Toronto Conflict, and Offshore. Unlike Synergy's competitor, Obsidian Conflict, the fanbase is much larger and always (or at least, almost always) online. There are even servers that offer you the ability to play custom community-made coop maps, along with support for other Half-Life 2 & Episodic Mods, such as Mistake of Pythagoras, Ravenholm, They Hunger Again, Coastline to Atmosphere, The Citizen Returns, Causality Effect, Half-Life: Precursor, and even Half-Life 2: Episode Three - The Closure (<----ew)! There is even an official Steam Workshop page that contains additional community-made coop maps and even reskins of models, textures, and sounds! Plus, it's easy to upload your own content to this workshop (srsly, why doesn't gmod use this method?!)!And another thing! Although it's been quite some time since we saw an update, the devs are currently working on adding support for Black Mesa, Half-Life: Source, and Half-Life 2: Update; so now I'm  really  looking forward to it!

												It's a great mod, really fun when you bring a couple friends along the ride. However, one complaint of mine is that the mod made the enemies really tough, and you really weak. If there's only two players, they're gonna be dying constantly, especially in the sections where you have to hold out. Setting the difficulty to easy does not help against that one bit, and it's overall really frustrating. So as i said before, i recommend you play with more than several people, otherwise you're not gonna have a good time.			"

Combine the HL2 campaing with an friend so you can make this more easier and mess around and work together to complete HL2 with your friend or friends. This has to be one of the best HL2 Co-Op Games.

												It's Half Life 2, but you get to watch people who are better at the game than you beat most of the monsters and drive you off of cliffs when you ride with them.Really though, Synergy is a great game. It makes re-playing HL2 worth it, even if you've played it a lot in single-player. Inevitably it almost ends up like a speedrun contest, with all the players vying to be among the first four to the end of the level. Quite an entertaining challenge for someone who's familiar with the game already. I haven't seen many custom maps for the game, but from what I've seen there are some great ones. Plus, c'mon, it's HL2. Even if you're not doing as much as your teammates you can still enjoy being in a Half-Life game.My only serious criticisms (aside from trusting total strangers to help you survive) are thus:--Some levels aren't scaled up in difficulty, so the first few people to the scene get to kill everything and everyone else has to play catch-up.--Healing and kill assists don't count for points on the scoreboard.Though there aren't a lot of servers around for this game, there's usually someone on a server somewhere. Even if there's not, there's enough empty ones around that you can invite a few friends over.Overall, I'd give Synergy an 8.5/10.			"

												This mod pretty much plays exactly like the game it's based on, but with Co-op elements. If you want any opinions about the graphics and the gameplay, just simply go look up any Half-Life 2 review. My only gripe with this mod though is it is unstable beyond belief, and for some reason some of my settings don't stay saved (could be just on my end though). If they cleaned up the updates better than they do and make the game at least stable, I would recommend this a lot more.Overall (TL;DR), this game isn't a bad idea and is actually pretty fun (especially with friends), but in the current state it's in at the time of writing this review, it feels rather unfinished despite it being on Steam for a long♥♥♥♥♥time.

												Rating: 7\10A very smart designed game by valve called Half life 2 was only single player. Until one who felt so great that he made the ultimate Coop experiance for a game that is still famous to this day. Synergy! One of the best coop experiances i have had in a extermly long time made a kick in for my library and made me as happy as can be! Not only you may ask questions on coop options as it has its own. and the air boat and jeep. They are sorted out as much as the setting. Even if there are bugs i still find this Game mod has alot of potential. All and all its a very enjoyable habitat and i would love to see more interested in this.			"

Resumindo: Synergy é basicamente um mod que permite que você jogue Half-Life 2 e alguns levels de Synergy on-line com amigos. Dá até 10 amigos, entao imagine jogar com todos eles, a zuera vai ser 2much. Os probleminhas são que você precisa de Half-Life 2, e seus amigos também. Mesmo assim, Synergy é um bom passa-tempo com os amigos se você quiser re-zerar Half-Life 2 on-line. 9.5/10			"

												It's pretty fun playing the story in co-op. It creates new possibilities to screw around. There are more alterations than I thought: Walls to prevent getting seperated, respawning near your companion, not requiring everyone to get to the level exit, more enemies, more recharge stations and so forth.The controls are a bit lagging which makes it hard to manouver the hovercraft or shoot with it. The fight against the helicopter is unfair and a total lacklustre, because you are getting in the crossfire easily and die every 10 seconds.Don't try to create a new server, take an existing one.I don't care for the multiplayer deathmatches.

												A must get for anyone who is a fan of Half Life, or Black Mesa. If you don't know what this mod is I will explain. This mod always people to play HL2, HL2 episode 1 & 2, and some various source games. You must own the game to play them, but the games are only $10 and are worth it. This mod is amazing experience Half life 2 online with friends or with strangers, non the less this mod is amazing.			"

												This mod is one of the worst coop mods I have played in a long time. There are so many reasons why I think this mod is bad but heres a few.Unfair enemy placementExtremely high health for enemys and bossesLOTS of Bugs which include lose of the gravity gun if you die, glitched animations for weapons, glitched vehicles that include not being able to enter the vehicle, bugged controls of the vehicle, these are only some bugs that reoccured a lot while I was playing the game.What could be done with this mod? If the creator fixed a lot of these bugs and glitches within the game and also would allow for a more fun time with the half life 2 campaign which would be allowing difficulties more then just the hard difficulties that the creators included. Also if you are wondering the server side of things did not contribute to the rating of this mod.			"

												Name: SynergyPrice: Free (if you own half life 2)Rating: Worth PlayingSynergy is a mod for half life 2. The game runs very smoothly and looks like half life 2. What this mod is about is that you play through half life 2 with your friends or other random people. You can have up to 18 players in one server. If you own just cause 2 then you probally know that just cause 2 has a multiplayer mod. This game is like that only that this isnt just cause 2 its half life 2. Before you download this game make sure you own half life 2.			"

												This mod is Amazing. Notice i put that with a capital A.This is by far my favorite half life 2 mod. I love it because i like to play games with my friends, And playing one of the best FPS games of all time with a friend is amazing. And i love the fact its all 3 half life games, AND it has its own Synergy missions. Though its a bit complicated to create a server for just you and a friend and no other random players joining in its still worth it9/10			"

												have you ever wanted to explore the Half-life series with a friend? well with this free mod for hl2 (find in store), you can play with 10 friends in all of the half life series past half-life 2. this is reasonably free becasue you need the game of your choice in order to play with friends. i would give this game a rating of 9/10 the reason it isnt 10/10 is becasue the servers are a bit wacked up and you cannot make a private one and have your friend join via message. but this game is perfect for a LAN party.

												Buggy, frustrating and unstable in addition to out of date but fun none the less. I'm of course reffering to Synergy not Half-Life 2. The issues have to do with laggy physics props and terrible connection problems in addition to the game randomly closing, not even crashing. I still highly reccomend it but it needs a TON of work these days. DO NOT play on hard mode as it's actually broken and makes the unstable connection even more noticeable as enemies take 5 crossbow hits to die in addition to hit reg problems.			"

												Synergy is a mod which allows two or more players to play Half-Life 2 and the episodes in co-operative mode. You can play through the entire story with friends, or custom made community maps.It is not badly designed, but there are occasional bugs or the mod could crash a few times. It can be also difficult to find a good server.Another problem is that Half-Life 2 levels are designed to be challenging for 1 player, playing with more than 2 players breaks almost all the difficulty.All in all Synergy is not a bad mod and definitly worth a try for those who liked Half Life 2 and wished they could play it together with a friend.Sounds 7/10Graphics 6/10Gameplay 6/10Atmosphere 7/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												I don't like this game for good reasons, there's is a difference in this game and Half Life 2. Reason #1 the physics in this game are ♥♥♥♥♥♥, you can pick up something with the gravity gun it'll move around while you're holding it, Reason #2 the game has a bad net code if you kill any enemy or throw something in this game it takes 2 seconds for the net code to respond. Reason #3 You die way too easily either if you're playing by yourself with other people or have the difficulty on easy, your health goes down within a snap in this game and then either you have to look for medkits or you just die. Reason #4 I don't know if it's only me but the game crashes like every 1 hour. And yes the discription says it's a simple Half Life 2 mod, well I'll tell you what it's a poorly simplified mod for Half Life 2, And everything in Half Life 2 is 10X better than how everything this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, and seriously Synergy Team why you need so much on change? WHY?! Because of you turning everything into♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's made this game not fun. So anyways this is what I think.My final verdict: 2/10P.S. why are the reviews postive? It not worth getting, to me.

												Thanks for riping off Obsidian Conflict.EDIT: Clarification: Synergy stole most of it's maps from Obsidan Conflict back in 2009~ it wasn't mainly a half life 2 coop mod. There are even assets that were first created in Obsidian Conflict that were stolen by synergy. It's atually really funny because Obsidian Conflicty had a a diffrent UI and setup then Syergy and as a result over 50% of the maps they took ether broke or were made more difficult then intended. for example the farming maps they were made for OC not Synergy, but Synergy Took them anyway and they turn into a one man show beacuse the point system didn't work right and you couldn't transfer points because Synergy's UI is more along the lines of HL2:DM then OC's UI.

												This game and its concept are flawless. The gameplay is smooth, good stuff in the workshop, you can ride vans and trucks, etc. You can pretty much host a server (with port-forwarding on, of course) and play with your friends.Pros-Good idea -Good performance-Good workshop-Good Game/GGThat's it, now ..Cons-Disgusting community-Once you join you hear some 12/11/13 year old acting like a full retard while running around with a cactus-Annoying ♥♥♥♥ing screaming and ♥♥♥♥ed up sounds in almost every server-Choppy animation of corpse -Disconnecting is expected at least twice per 5 hours of gameplay-This game is dead, nearly no servers are left aliveHere's an exampleThe instant I joined a server, some constipated retard came up to me with a ♥♥♥♥ing cactus while making ♥♥♥♥ed up sounds. Once the player is done his pig-out session, he is now speaking with his immature voice ""DO U LIEK MY ♥♥♥♥TUS?"" -""No. Mature up"" I replied, and then I got vote-banned with his other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ friends.Conclusion, DON'T BUY THIS, UNLESS YOU WANT TO PLAY RAGING-SIMULATOR			"

												Taking Half-Life 2 into the Co-op realm isnt more then just a novel idea, do what couldent be done before with teamwork as you play though all of Half-Life 2 all over again with a friend or 3(dozen) make the feelings you experience shift entirely, the game also naturally scales the difficulty because of this, regardless if you are ACTUALLY playing with a friend.So if you and someone you know has Half-Life 2 come pick up this mod and have a blast, just dont ragequit when your buddy takes all the ammo.

Essentially, though, you're just playing an online edition of Half-Life... which is cool and all, considering you're pretty much getting a free DLC mode for the game you already own.So, yeah, find some friends, or play online if you're forever alone, and try and win these missions.

												Being bantered as a ""Co-op"" mod for a mother-♥♥♥♥ing awesome game like Half-Life 2, I really had high hopes for Synergy but you have no idea how disappointed I ended up being after just a few weeks of playing this so-called ""Co-Op"" game.  I was so ♥♥♥♥ing gutted I felt suicidal and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off with the World in general.  I still have nightmares now.Reasons this game sucks in no particular order except of what really pisses me off the most:-1) A♥♥♥♥♥♥load of banhammer wannabes aka trolls that are not admins but act like they own the place by trying to act badass by vote kicking or vote banning decent or even great players from a server or scaring them into leaving or otherwise just being hostile 2) The very rare but no less unnerving hostile banhammer admin (who gagged me from even mentioning his steam name and server name though thankfully his server is now 2 years dead!  Well for now at least...)3) A♥♥♥♥♥♥load of bullying trolls4) No teamwork5) A♥♥♥♥♥♥load of rushers 6) Trolls that make unnecessary map change votes7) A♥♥♥♥♥♥load of glitches If you value your sanity, do NOT play this!Forgive me if I come across as a sensitive prick or insane but it is a sad irony that so-called players act this way in Synergy.  Half-Life 2s back story is becoming reality in my opinion.  The World is becoming crapsack. Resources are dwindling slowly but surely.  The World looks set to experience a never ending heatwave not seen for 55 million years in just a matter of decades. Fauna and Flora are becoming extinct.  People are fighting and suffering Combine-esque punishment.  The only thing is, the enemies are not the Combine or Xenian, it's ourselves. My point is; If we can't play together as a team in a so-called ""Co-op"" game, by helping and healing and arming and transporting each other and by being friends instead of being banhammer wannabes or just rushing or being plain hostile or indifferent, then what chance has the World got of escaping or simply surviving it's worst era thus far? Instead of being part of a messianic Resistance, we are acting like the Combine.  :(			"

												This mod used to be amazing.  It used to work perfectly.  That was my impression in 2009 when I last played it.  However, now it's too buggy to even play.  The character selection doesn't work at all; the game just picks a random character evey time you respawn.  The game frequently fails to transition between levels, claiming it can't find map files.  Worst of all are the Steam UserID Ticket errors, which seem to come up ever couple levels, and require a restart of Steam in order to continue playing.  The developer's website claims that the latest SteamPipe release fixes ""most if not all of the flakey issues.""  Clearly they are mistaken.Maybe there are workarounds for some of the issues.  I don't know and honestly don't care.  This mod is being offered through the Steam store, so it should work ""out of the box.""  I recommend you pass over this one, it isn't worth the aggrivation.

												The idea is great, althought starting a server of your own is complicated, game often crashes, some of the graphics are missing, there are glitches and there are changes to the original game like ( GMan showing on places he ISN'T supposed to be, waves of combines are increased, there are bonus ammo crates put on inappropriate places, the car glitches when 2 players are in it, car's turbo doesn't work on particular maps ( maps where it's NEEDED ) and ""boss battles"" such as the helicopter one not only double the hp of the chopper but add another one, completely ruining the story and making it too hard.

												A mod left to rot.I'll be straight forward with this.PROS-You can spawn your own vehicle...! The bad thing about that is that you won't be using it much.-More weapons! That includes the Desert Eagle, MP5k and one more I think-Fun with friends, if you have anyCONS-Every server has a ping of 400 to 3000-Barely anyone plays it. If you are lucky enough, you will find a server with 5 Russians on it -The difficulty is obsurd. It will take you about 3 magnum shots to the head of a metrocop to kill him at the easiest difficulty. -(Hey what's up guys) Scarce ammo supply, even if you have a few players-Buggy as hell-Very, very long level transitions-Never updatedI had high hopes for this. Half Life 2 is one of my favorite games of all time, and I thought it would be even better to play it with other people.Mods, fix this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.			"

												Good start, but very broken. Played co-op with only one friend. Really enjoyed myself for an hour or two, bumper boats were a fun novelty for two minutes. After a while, though, the enemies multiplied well past the point of being defeatable. Didn't help that Synergy lost track of my ammunition and while proceeding through levels I was left completely empty-handed--not even a crowbar. When the enemies were proving undefeatable and constantly increasing, rather than decreasing, in count as we killed them off, we skipped forward to the next levels, but again found inventory lost again. Also, one of us was completely ""wiggin' out"", as it was constantly pointing in two different directions at once. Looked like a network programming glitch. It's all on video though.

												The connection was lag-tastic for half an hour. All ammo is halved, meaning that any number of Combine is a lethal force since you'll be out of bullets in seconds. all weapons and vehicles are first come first serve, making any vehicle and weapon drop-off a race to not get screwed over. Never before have I seen a group of three players wiped out by some of the first enemies in a game because of somehting as simple as running out of bullets and dying in a corner. And after you die, you have to wait about 30-60 seconds to respawn. Yes, you read that right. This wouldn't be such an issue if you wern't forced to watch your friends die one by one because they all ran out of ammo. Again.			"

												If you REALLY want to play co-op, than this game is really your only choice. Other co-op games like Obsidian Conflict and Sven Co-op are dead; last time I checked, this mod had SOME servers up. The game is extremely laggy, however, and a lot of the servers play the HL2 campaigns with hardly any original/custom maps out there.			"

												Are people reviewing this mod, or Half Life 2? Honestly this ""mod"" is terrible. It's only fun if you have 3+ friends to play it with and is overall just boring. No saving, no replayability, nothing, it's not fun.The only fun you'll have is joining random servers with PvP enable and kill everyone.Even then it's rare to find one and gets boring quick.			"

												What can be better than a Half-Life 2 coop mode? Synergy answeres that question with ""almost anything""A very lazy excuse for a mod. HL2 on its own was made for only one player, and while Synergy tries to answer the questions a veteran of the original game such as ""how will the vehicle sections work?"" with some lazy coding, for the majority of the experience I greatly recommend that HL2 on its own will provide a more enjoyable time.In conclusion: Frustrating, annoying and at best earns a small chuckle. I am infinatly greateful that it was free. Because even if it was only two dollars I'd be hollering for my money back.			"

But since it is free, all people owe it to the company to pick this up and support them. Any amount of money that can be spared for such an endeavor should be sent immediately.

												Synergy is this really cool application I use that allows me to control multiple computers from one keyboard and mouse. It works by creating a virtual keyboard and mouse on the client machines and sending keyboard and mouse signals from the host machine to the clients via TCP. I've been using it ever since the Meek told me about it at some point in 2004 or something. It's been completely indispensable to me since I have so many computers around me at all times on account of the fact that I am a massive nerd. I just love surrounding myself with computers, OK? It makes me feel one step closer to the future which Star Trek The Next Generation represents! Just imagine it, teraquads of information processing power at my fingertips, fully tactile and re-organizable displays, warp cores that bring the galaxy to our couches! What a wonderful future we approach. I feel like I'm already there, basking in the light of a half dozen computer screens.			"

												For those who loved Sven coop or are interested in multiplayer in HL:2 and its' episodes, it is a fun game.  I have encountered a downloading error with it but it wasn't an issue with the game itself.  There are people on facebook who will answer questions regarding to problems with the mod.  It is also fun if you enjoy a few extra enemies on top of what is already given.  One downside; if you're playing by yourself and you die or your entire team dies, then the map will restart all of the progress.			"

												My hours in Synergy are, by far, the most fun I've had playing a Source Mod. The premise is so simple (Half-Life 2 Co-op), but it's just so well-executed and addicting. Even the maps that come with the mod are really great (I recommend syn_trials), and it supports maps from other mods for Half-Life 2 that are single-player. This game is just all-around awesome, and I recommend to everyone who has Half-Life 2 on their games list.			"

												Personally, Half-Life 2 doesn't appeal to me as much as the original. Don't get me wrong - It's a great game, definitely, but I find that some of the things it does differently to HL1 don't really do much for me.Having said that, playing Half-Life 2 co-op is tons of fun. Synergy is great.			"

												Synergy is a mod allowing you to play co-operatively through Half-Life 2 and most other source games, it's a lot like Sven co-op in that respect. some of the new vehicles present have their share of problems, the larger ones struggle to get up hills, they don't have turbo, and they corner like a brick sliding on ice, but if you all drive separate buggies, this doesn't have any real negative effect to your gameplay.A great mod, and a real blast to play with friends, 8/10			"

Even third party games like Calamity City! Overall I would give this game a 7/10 because there's still a few bugs. That shouldn't keep you from trying it out though! Have fun!			"

I have encountered a downloading error with it but it wasn't an issue with the game itself.  There are people on facebook who will answer questions regarding to problems with the mod.  It is also fun if you enjoy a few extra enemies on top of what is already given.  One downside; if you're playing by yourself and you die or your entire team dies, then the map will restart all of the progress.			"

It is very stable, and because it is simply a Mod of other games, it's not a terrible HL2 mod. I reccommend Synergy for any fan of Half-Life 2 or source Engine games.			"

												A very old school mod for Half Life 2 that adds some much needed fixes to the game but most importantly makes HL2 co-op and it's easy as pie to setup a listening server for you and your friends to play on and by far the best map to play on is Ravenholm, play through that one as a team and laugh your asses off at each others misfortune. Another nice thing about this mod is that you can use ALL HL2: Deathmatch maps with it and most Garrysmod maps and with a few spawn codes, some console commands and a little impulse 101 mixed with physcannon_mega_enabled 1 makes this a whole lot of fun to play with friends specially if they don't own Garrysmod.

												LOVE this mod.  With Sven Coop 2 never having a release - I was saddened by the lack of HL2 Campaign Co-Op Mods out in the market.  When I heard of Synergy - I was excited from the start.  I wasn't disappointed when I played.The mod does a great job of accounting for single-player limitations like auto-mobiles, check-points, etc.  Each has a system arounds it that ensures ""speed runners"" don't ruin the experience and that every player has a auto-mobile when one is applicable.I highly recommend and hope that more people join in on the Co-Op Fun!

												Synegy is unique but not necessaitly in a positive manner. It offers players the ability to play Half Life 2's singleplayer storyline in multiplayer, transforming Half Life 2 into a co-operation based game. However, Half Life 2 was created with the singleplayer mechanism in mind as all occurences, NPCs, environmental factors and excetra operate with a single user in mind, granting you undivided attention, hence Gordon Freeman's name being repeatedly chanted by Rebels and citizens given you are meant to be the protagionist, the main hero, the conqurer, the Genges Khan of the Eastern European Cities occupied by Combine foreign forces, centralised at the Citadel under Dr. Wallace Breen - the antoganist. Transforming such a gameplay mecahnism is a tedious process and Synergy did not handle it well. The idea is remarkable, however the gameplay and efforts to meet the hype (if any) failed. Hence, I would not recommend it. I would recommend Half Life 2: Deathmatch instead as it tweaks the gameplay to deliver on the co-op and multiplayer system of gameplay hence granting the player the ease to accept the reality and storyline/context of the game which would permit enjoyment and an actual positive review which is yet to be seen in numbers for Synergy.

												~ - opens the consolesv_cheats 1 - activates cheatsimpulse 101 - gives all weapons, ammo, health and armornoclip - clipping offThese are the tools you'll need to complete this co-op version of Half-Life 2. The levels have been modified to have more enemies, enemies with more health and they give you multiple vehicles for the driving portions. The boss HP and swarm numbers were ramped up way too much, though, so you will need to cheat in more ammo on a regular basis... One helicopter I recall needed like 50+ rockets, no exaggeration, and there wasn't one of those infinite rocket chests lying around (they should have added some of these the way they added extra vehicles). You'll also need to noclip past some bugged parts now and then.Overall, though, this is a fun free mod if you want to play Half-Life 2 with a friend. Very much recommended.			"

												I was 4 when the man lied to me. Mummy and Daddy let me go to the Barbie isle in the shop...That's when I met the man. Round, large, with a red shirt and short, brown hair...He said he had the new Barbie doll, which was a little girl...He said she looked sweet, innocent and oh so beautiful...He took me to the carpark, I thought I could trust him...He opened up his van jumped in and held his hand out to help me in...I thought that was really kind of him...I took ahold of his hand, and hopped in...That's when his other had grabbed my butt...I started to get scared, he didn't take his hand off...He pulled me in further and closed the van doors behind me...I didn't know what to do...He frantically started to pull my shirt and dress off, panting as he did so...He strapped a collar to my neck...It was cold, heavy and smelt of sweat, blood and tears...It was chocking me...""Please take it off, it hurts"" I whispered...To which he replied.""It will be worth the weight.""

												I really wish they programmed the enemy difficulty better in this mod. What they did to try to accomodate for the ability to have up to like 10 players is they automatically doubled the amount of enemies. Okay, but I was playing this game with just one friend and when we got to the helicopter (which IMO was really ffffffffffffffff♥♥♥♥ing hard in single player) there were TWO helicopters. For just two players that seemed a little unfair. I still recommend this mod because, well you get to play Half-Life 2 with others. But it would be nice if they had a different enemy difficulty for each number of players so with just 2 players you're not getting massacred and with 10 players it's not too easy.			"

												Synegy is unique but not necessaitly in a positive manner. It offers players the ability to play Half Life 2's singleplayer storyline in multiplayer, transforming Half Life 2 into a co-operation based game. However, Half Life 2 was created with the singleplayer mechanism in mind as all occurences, NPCs, environmental factors and excetra operate with a single user in mind, granting you undivided attention, hence Gordon Freeman's name being repeatedly chanted by Rebels and citizens given you are meant to be the protagionist, the main hero, the conqurer, the Genges Khan of the Eastern European Cities occupied by Combine foreign forces, centralised at the Citadel under Dr. Wallace Breen - the antoganist. Transforming such a gameplay mecahnism is a tedious process and Synergy did not handle it well. The idea is remarkable, however the gameplay and efforts to meet the hype (if any) failed. Hence, I would not recommend it. I would recommend Half Life 2: Deathmatch instead as it tweaks the gameplay to deliver on the co-op and multiplayer system of gameplay hence granting the player the ease to accept the reality and storyline/context of the game which would permit enjoyment and an actual positive review which is yet to be seen in numbers for Synergy.

												Great mod and have been playing it since its beginnings. One problem still persists, we always have to sanitize our maps of any decals on physical objects. The engine HATES that and will crash letting you know how you can't go using maps in multiplayer with decals on doors. Luckily we found a script that removes the data from the maps so MP servers are happy. After this we played for hours without any crash and it was just as worth it as the first day I downloaded it!

And most servers playing half life 2 levels are stuck on the canals or Nova Prospekt.

												This mod remind me of Princess Diana.The game handles many people at once so you can play in big battles.  You can plant many land mine or have rocket war with Combine.  Camilla steal my husband.  Husband steal my brake.The mod is a good and simple way of playing game.  Make me want to play Left 4 Dead with 16 Bill's all looking for George Romero teabagging kid by train.Game very popular in Jalalabad.  I can play with all my wives.  No more taking turns.			"

												Synergy is a fun HL2 mod. It allows you to play thoose bothersome combat sections in Half-Life 2 with other people online, allowing for fun multiplayer gameplay. It is very stable, and because it is simply a Mod of other games, it's not a terrible HL2 mod. I reccommend Synergy for any fan of Half-Life 2 or source Engine games.			"

												Not much to say about it considering it is a mod of a already praised game. Synergy is probably one of the best multiplayer mods of a game that never head multiplayer.Synergy is up there with Euro Truck 2's online, Just Cause 2 Multiplayer, and many others, and it was released many years ago, it's simple to join and host games and there are many simplistic ideas, the only real problem is the game likes to disconnect randomly when switching levels. Other than that, I have no other complaints, and it is a lot of fun to play.Keep in mind, I am barely in any way talking about the side stuff offered by Synergy, if you're not playing Half-Life 2 Co-op, then I don't really know what to tell you.It's better than Obsidian Conflict and Sven Co-op in my opinion when it comes to functionality with the Half-Life games, but the general game isn't as good as Obsidian Conflict (but nobody gives a crap about the side stuff).Overall it's a lot of fun, and if you're a fan of the Half-Life games I recommend this mod, even if not I still recommend giving it a try with some pals.

												This game.....has changed. I use to play  this game a lot on my old steam account (before itwas hacked). Back then, there was actual teamwork, squad tactics, and all the rest. Some of the best maps were the puzzle ones because they reqired clever thinking and teamwork. But now.....its more like a crowbar rush. Game's stil fun, but whenever people have to do something actually challenging, they just leave the game or do at !rtv for a new map. So play at your own risk I suppose. Lots of fun though.Overall: 9/10 "

												Cool little mod for HL2. Do you like HL2, or any of it's derivatives? Well, as long as you own the original, you can share it with your friends! I personally think it works best when you know who your playing with in real life, and you're Skypeing with them while you play. It's an interesting time, and reminds me of the PSX Half-Life coop game, Half-Life Decay (with the exception of there are no puzzles in this that require two people to solve).			"

Even the maps that come with the mod are really great (I recommend syn_trials), and it supports maps from other mods for Half-Life 2 that are single-player.

												If you have HL2, don't have this game, have countless HL2 mods but feel that something is missing, grab some friends and get the this game. You can have all sorts of fun in this game and it isn't even just the storyline(especially in the first level in City 17) you can throw bicycles at homeless people, have races in airboats and jeeps, have everybody cruise in one giant truck and just wreck every alien that steps in your way, laughing(or getting mad, but that doesn't happen that often) at the bugs that occur, fighting over who is the real Gordon Freeman in your friend group because the NPCs only refer to you as Gordon Freeman and not a big pack of misfits, and if that doesn't convince you to get this game, this will: It has Mac and Linux ports, so all your apple and penguin friends can play along with you and your PC buddies. And if THAT still doesn't convince you, I honestly don't know what to say. If this has convinced you, stop reading this, grab some friends and treat yourself to some synergy(oh, and HL2 is necessary, and hamachi, depending on who you're playing with)110/10 Seriously, stop reading this and get it.

(The base of the original game is required)Synergy is probably one of the best community mods I've ever played because I'm a huge fan of the half life series. With the synergy mod this allows you to join random servers and play with fellow half life fans or just play with your friends.Pros : - Able to play with your friends- Play With Other half life fans - Oculus Rift/Virtual Reality support Cons : - Not as active as it use to be, it still has a good few hundred people on to keep it alive but it needs more players.- Every now and then you'll get into a laggy server, just make sure you find a server near you to keep your ping down.

Even the maps that come with the mod are really great (I recommend syn_trials), and it supports maps from other mods for Half-Life 2 that are single-player. This game is just all-around awesome, and I recommend to everyone who has Half-Life 2 on their games list.			"

												Half-life 2 can be surprisingly fun to play with a friend! None of the levels feel too cramped, and there's often just the right amount of difficulty to support two or more players. However, I thought the difficulty was a little high at times, making it more of a challenge than it should be to get past an area. I would recommend turning on Vintage Mode when creating a server so you can get the original Half-life 2 experience, without the difficulty spikes. Also, the games occasionally isn't very well optimized for more than one player. For example, only a single one-seated jeep would be spawned in a couple of the coastal levels, which means you have to spawn in others for the extra players.			"

												Me and my friend had a blast on this. there are SOOO many moments where this gameshines and should have been co-op. my two major gripes are that co-operative play cant happen privately unless you know how to set up a server (wich I dont). my other complaint is that this game glitchy with a capital G. granted, we where having soo much fun that it was just a moment to laugh about, even though the major glitch I ran into was just gibbing at random once or twice on spawn. one thing people don't see is that this game also supports black mesa, and other source game co-op. this adds to its value majorly and I highly recommend downloading this or even picking up a copy of half life 2, exclusively to play this with friends. If you don't have half- life 2, what are you waiting for? go buy the orange box. INCREDIBLE value even if tf2 just gives you a hat.			"

May have a bit of glitches. but yeah. Its awesome. Its free but requires another game. I have went right into this game. Havent played with 10 players, but I have played at the limit of 7 or 6 people. I once did the whole campaign with an whole 6 people team of all of Half-Life 2 and the epiodic game. and Yes I do reccomend this game. Thanks who ever created this game			"

												This game.....has changed. I use to play  this game a lot on my old steam account (before itwas hacked). Back then, there was actual teamwork, squad tactics, and all the rest. Some of the best maps were the puzzle ones because they reqired clever thinking and teamwork. But now.....its more like a crowbar rush. Game's stil fun, but whenever people have to do something actually challenging, they just leave the game or do at !rtv for a new map. So play at your own risk I suppose. Lots of fun though.Overall: 9/10 "

												What could go wrong?Synergy is a half life 2 co-op mod for the original campaign. (The base of the original game is required)Synergy is probably one of the best community mods I've ever played because I'm a huge fan of the half life series. With the synergy mod this allows you to join random servers and play with fellow half life fans or just play with your friends.Pros : - Able to play with your friends- Play With Other half life fans - Oculus Rift/Virtual Reality support Cons : - Not as active as it use to be, it still has a good few hundred people on to keep it alive but it needs more players.- Every now and then you'll get into a laggy server, just make sure you find a server near you to keep your ping down.

												Half-life 2 can be surprisingly fun to play with a friend! None of the levels feel too cramped, and there's often just the right amount of difficulty to support two or more players. However, I thought the difficulty was a little high at times, making it more of a challenge than it should be to get past an area. I would recommend turning on Vintage Mode when creating a server so you can get the original Half-life 2 experience, without the difficulty spikes. Also, the games occasionally isn't very well optimized for more than one player. For example, only a single one-seated jeep would be spawned in a couple of the coastal levels, which means you have to spawn in others for the extra players.			"

												Ever wanted to play the superb Half Life 2 campaign with your friends? Well, now you can. Download this mod (it's FREE) and before you know it you and your buds can be hurling toilets at Combine in no time. Although the eventual release of Sven Co-op 2 will probably surpass this, for now it remains a must for Half Life players.			"

												Half-life 2 can be surprisingly fun to play with a friend! None of the levels feel too cramped, and there's often just the right amount of difficulty to support two or more players. However, I thought the difficulty was a little high at times, making it more of a challenge than it should be to get past an area. I would recommend turning on Vintage Mode when creating a server so you can get the original Half-life 2 experience, without the difficulty spikes. Also, the games occasionally isn't very well optimized for more than one player. For example, only a single one-seated jeep would be spawned in a couple of the coastal levels, which means you have to spawn in others for the extra players.			"

												Synergy is what you're looking for if you want to play the best game ever made, but with your friends! I played through all the Half Life games with my friend using Synergy and it was so much more fun that playing it alone even though it had some few bugs that made us play the entire level again, it still was so much fun.This isn't much of a review I guess, more like my experience with it but whatever.Get this mod NOW if you want to play Half Life 2 CO-OP! (This works with EP1 and EP2 too!)Also don't forget to check out the cool Synergy made maps too!8.7 / 10 (Some game breaking bugs and sometimes crashes, but still epic mod)			"

												Half life 2 is a fun and inovative game ( give us half life 3 gaben you ♥♥♥♥ ) but theres no co-op campaign , untill now . synergy pretty  much allows you and your mates to play the half life 2 story together and other custom maps , that you will imediatly regret playing as either they are way to ♥♥♥♥in hard 9 or im just♥♥♥♥♥♥at hl2 combat) or the map is sooo ♥♥♥♥in bad you'll wish you parent's aborted you . So that pretty much sums up this game , also its only worth playing if you have actual freinds that will want to play with you , if you dont or your friend think your a a ♥♥♥♥in ♥♥♥♥♥♥ then thats your problem not mines , go get some friends ya loser .Defo worth platying WITH FRIENDS and papa bless those with friends every one else  go be a weaboo and KYS.

												I really wish they programmed the enemy difficulty better in this mod. What they did to try to accomodate for the ability to have up to like 10 players is they automatically doubled the amount of enemies. Okay, but I was playing this game with just one friend and when we got to the helicopter (which IMO was really ffffffffffffffff♥♥♥♥ing hard in single player) there were TWO helicopters. For just two players that seemed a little unfair. I still recommend this mod because, well you get to play Half-Life 2 with others. But it would be nice if they had a different enemy difficulty for each number of players so with just 2 players you're not getting massacred and with 10 players it's not too easy.			"

												Just when you think you've achieved it. Nostalgia is in full effect and killing combine has never seemed fresher. Then a friend holds an explosive barrel to your face whilst you're fighting enemies causing you to shoot it and blow yourself up. To make it worse, said friend will then cackle loudly into his microphone before running off and dying and then spewing profanity at loud volumes thus causing you to restart the mission. I am that friend.			"

												This was my most best game for roleplaying, i used many plays and stuff, Due its funner then the original, More gman, Friends to play with, Sense 2005, This game was sently decinded as multiplayer, Or singaplayer, My favirote part was d3_o1_breen, Its also fun when you get the gravity gun, Like elis scrapyard Eastergs, Glitchs and more were about this game sense it was maded (2005) It was only a fun Game like when Half-Life 2 Was created, HL2 Ep 1 was maded into the hardware of this game, HL2 Ep 2 Was my favirote part at the end, Im assuming There will be HL3 on 2020 (If there is) But it might be a seven hour war like the combines had seven hours to take over the planet it, taked place in germany i thought, But anyways i thought it was a good game for people to play, Darkrp, Or Just normal playing or just doing blind episodes of videos of it, Anyways this would be Fun, for the coast, the dead citizens, The universal unions, The Combine Striders this game was too easy and the same for CS.

Though, there are some bugs, it's still a great mod and idea for Half Life. All we need now is Synergy-based Portal. (and by that, I mean up to like, 8 people XD)			"

												Half Life 2 and the episodes were seemingly kick♥♥♥♥♥ This just tipped the scale. If you are an owner and/or frequent player of Half-Life 2, this was made for you! It completely combines the beauty of half life 2, the fun bullcrap of multiplayer, the hillarity of Gmod style addons, and in my opinion it is the new Sven-coop. Take it from me, I play this game way too much and the last time I played it we had 7 different people on gaming computers. It was total chaos. I believe this mod to be the most amazing half-life 2 mod out there, and if your computer can run it, get it!			"

												It's a mod that lets you play all HL2 games in co-op, what more can you ask for?Well, I'm afraid the game has many bugs which can literally make it impossible to progress to the next level.If you have the gravity gun and you die, say goodbye to your precious toilet flinger.  You literally lose the gravity gun, the only way to get it back is with cheats.   Servers are completely dead, not even one still standing.I can recommend this if you and a friend both have LogMeIn Hamachi to make a server and just want to f*ck about.  I'm personally guilty of using SLAMs to launch the Jeep a good 50m into the air.TL;DR It's buggier than the corpse of Duke Nukem Forever and the servers are dead.  Only get it if you and a friend want to f*ck around and launch Jeeps into the air.			"

												-New Review-I must say for a community mod, this is actually pretty good.It may say that it is free, but it comes at a price. First you need HL2, so first you need to buy that before playing, you can get the episodes in order to play them on Synergy, but that is optional. Also unless you want to play on public servers all the time, I suggest you learn how to make dedicated servers, or download Hamachi, and use that. But I didn't get on here just to tell you what you need in order to olay this game, I came to review this game and tell you why you should get it.The major difference between HL2 and Synergy is that you can play with other people, which can lead to a lot of shenanigans. I don't think this game was meant to be played seriously. It was probably made so you can laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off with your friends in a depressing world where aliens kill people on the daily. Where you can confuse the everloving crap out of the AI or screw with the Combine to the point where if you were to do that in real life you would probably get arrested for multiple accounts of throwing a bottle at the same officer and getting on the news because you thought it was funny. Of course no game is perfect, but these are relativeley minor stuff. I think the only 2 that are worth saying are that there is no system that allows players to select a playermodel and keep that playermodel, it's just randomly selected. Next is that the workshop doesn't really work, either that or I'm just doing it wrong, if you subscribe to something, then create a server just to see if you did it, nothing happens, of course you may need GFScape for some of the addons, but I'm not a modding expert so I can't really say anything about that. But in spite of all this, if you are looking for a way to play a serious game in a much more comedic manner, than this game might be the ticket to throwing stuff at the same metrocop at City 17.For those of you who wish to read my outdated review just to see what the fuss is about you can read it right hereDon't get this game, it's not worth it. Not only do you need Half Life 2 to play it, which is somewhat understandable along with the episodes if you want to play those. But you also need Hamachi You need an external program to play it with your friends. Co-Op with strangers (or on public servers) is a double-edged sword, on one end you have people are willing to help you and on the other you have people who are only there to ruin your day. For a game that was made for multiplayer, you shouldn't have to download an external program in order to play it with your friends, which is what I bet was the way this game was meant to be played. I can name plenty of games made for multiplayer that don't require Hamachi.So until the day that they allow you to play with your friends without the need for Hamachi or anything, I would not recommend playing this game.Edit Dec 23 2016 - Spelling errorsEdit Christmas Eve 2016 - Basically did a 180.

												This game is great. You have never known fun until you play the first part of Half Life 2 collecting EVERY barrel you come across, then throwing them at the teleporter. This game is great if you have played Half life 2 before, or if it is your first time. The only thing that is bad is that the Hunter Choppers seem to duplicate is you have two players, causing a VERY hard boss fight, which can be solved by god mode. Overall 9.5/10 for what I have played so far.			"

												Best HL2 modification ever. Seriously, who can't deny the fact that you'll have fun playing with other people who you don't know, or do know? If you found Half Life 2 fun, but got bored because of no Multiplayer SP campaign support, this obviously solves the problem. With servers in Houston, Texas, this allows American people to have good connection. If you have bad ping, making your own server and playing with friends is another way. There are some bugs for me though, such as when I play so many servers to the point where the game actually has a black screen. I have to hard stop my computer, but the fun factor prevents me from giving this a bad rating. Overall, I give this an 8.5/10. Why the hell are you waiting? Download this and have a Multiplayer Campaign!			"

												This mod is what many half life players have wanted for years. 9/10.The second half life online game is what I have wanted to do with my friends for a very long time, but it did not exist. So you can imagine how happy I was when my mates told me about this.The games brother (Sven) is extremely addictive and the same can be said about this.Synergy does have speed runners like Sven, which is the main disadvantage. Hosting a server can prevent this.One last thing would be that almost every server has custom music or silly sound effects that can be triggered by any player at any moment. This means it gets spammed over and over until you go mad and have to leave the server, which really gets on my nerves.			"

												-New Review-I must say for a community mod, this is actually pretty good.It may say that it is free, but it comes at a price. First you need HL2, so first you need to buy that before playing, you can get the episodes in order to play them on Synergy, but that is optional. Also unless you want to play on public servers all the time, I suggest you learn how to make dedicated servers, or download Hamachi, and use that. But I didn't get on here just to tell you what you need in order to olay this game, I came to review this game and tell you why you should get it.The major difference between HL2 and Synergy is that you can play with other people, which can lead to a lot of shenanigans. I don't think this game was meant to be played seriously. It was probably made so you can laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off with your friends in a depressing world where aliens kill people on the daily. Where you can confuse the everloving crap out of the AI or screw with the Combine to the point where if you were to do that in real life you would probably get arrested for multiple accounts of throwing a bottle at the same officer and getting on the news because you thought it was funny. Of course no game is perfect, but these are relativeley minor stuff. I think the only 2 that are worth saying are that there is no system that allows players to select a playermodel and keep that playermodel, it's just randomly selected. Next is that the workshop doesn't really work, either that or I'm just doing it wrong, if you subscribe to something, then create a server just to see if you did it, nothing happens, of course you may need GFScape for some of the addons, but I'm not a modding expert so I can't really say anything about that. But in spite of all this, if you are looking for a way to play a serious game in a much more comedic manner, than this game might be the ticket to throwing stuff at the same metrocop at City 17.For those of you who wish to read my outdated review just to see what the fuss is about you can read it right hereDon't get this game, it's not worth it. Not only do you need Half Life 2 to play it, which is somewhat understandable along with the episodes if you want to play those. But you also need Hamachi You need an external program to play it with your friends. Co-Op with strangers (or on public servers) is a double-edged sword, on one end you have people are willing to help you and on the other you have people who are only there to ruin your day. For a game that was made for multiplayer, you shouldn't have to download an external program in order to play it with your friends, which is what I bet was the way this game was meant to be played. I can name plenty of games made for multiplayer that don't require Hamachi.So until the day that they allow you to play with your friends without the need for Hamachi or anything, I would not recommend playing this game.Edit Dec 23 2016 - Spelling errorsEdit Christmas Eve 2016 - Basically did a 180.

												This game is great. You have never known fun until you play the first part of Half Life 2 collecting EVERY barrel you come across, then throwing them at the teleporter. This game is great if you have played Half life 2 before, or if it is your first time. The only thing that is bad is that the Hunter Choppers seem to duplicate is you have two players, causing a VERY hard boss fight, which can be solved by god mode. Overall 9.5/10 for what I have played so far.			"
