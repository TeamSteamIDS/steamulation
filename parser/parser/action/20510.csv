												First off, do not go into Clear Sky if you haven't at least played Shadow of Chernobyl first. I'll begin with my overall opinion of CS. It's inferior compared to SoC, and especially inferior compared to CoP. The Faction Wars system, one of the main selling points to CS, is confusing at best. You can side with three different factions in each area of the game (though you automatically side with one by default at the beginning), and then certain factions become hostile towards you. In return, you get the chance to earn extra jobs and top-tier equipment earlier than normal. The only problem is when you have to actually fight the opposing factions. You need to travel to certain areas of the map, take out any resistance you encounter there, and wait for backup to arrive. In addition, if any of those areas come under attack, you're expected to show up and help out. Thus, you sometimes wind up with scenarios where you're halfway across the map, and get a call from a lone survivor armed with a shotgun to high-tail it over to their position and kindly take out the group of seven guys all armed with military-grade automatic rifles, please. The worst part is that your opposing factions don't stay dead. I've captured every single point including the main base, and killed everyone I possibly could, and they just respawn the second you leave. The good news is, while you will still have to help your allies out, you still get paid a substantial amount of cash for taking out the main base, so it's not all bad, I suppose.Without a doubt, the worst part of CS is the enemy AI. For the most part, it's the same as SoC, except for the fact that these enemies can use grenades. Even on lower difficulties, you'll be tapping the quicksave button every few kills just in case they decide to spontaneously send an entire squads' worth of grenades next to your feet. Even worse is the fact that the AI is ungodly accurate with those grenades. Wherever they throw them, they end up directly at your feet with a one-second fuse. It's not at all uncommon to watch an enemy throw a grenade in the wrong direction (as in, they're facing away from you), only to see it reverse directions in mid-air and teleport right next to you. This is especially bad on the final mission, where enemies literally spawn from nowhere armed with automatics loaded with armor-piercing rounds and grenades primed and ready. The most common thing I found myself looking for in CS was not ammo, or artifacts, or even money, as opposed to SoC. No, it was bandages and medkits to replenish any health I was losing from unfair grenades. If you're playing through on higher difficulties, your first priority is to find some armor that isn't completely terrible, and then stock up on as many healing items as you can. Otherwise, you most likely won't stand a chance.If you're coming from SoC, you should know that the system for picking up artifacts is radically different than how it used to be. Where they used to be waiting on the ground in plain sight for you to just grab, they're now hidden in the centers of anomalies. You won't be able to grab an artifact unless you have your detector out (press the O button to pull the detector out, and press 2 to dual-weild it with your pistol), and unless the anomaly you're looking at happens to contain one. Most anomalies don't. Personally, I held off on artifact hunting until I got a better detector, but if you can deal with lots of trial-and-error and quicksaving, you're welcome to try.Speaking of artifacts, not every piece of armor you find can actually equip them. For some, you need to take it to a person who can upgrade weapons and armor, and pray that they're capable of adding an artifact container or two. Thankfully, most armors can, although it will cost you a good amount of money, even more than upgrading a top-tier assault rifle. Speaking of upgrades, if you couldn't already tell, you can do that now. The same people who offer upgrades also repair your damaged weapons and armor (for a nominal fee, of course), sell you locations of stashes (which can also be found on dead bodies, although sometimes the person selling you a location will tell you what you can find before you open it), and offer you jobs which usually consist of ""find information on a particular upgrade in a stash somewhere and bring it back to me"". Keep in mind that you still need to find the stash first, as it's not marked on your map.CS has a much different atmosphere compared to SoC and even CoP. While the other two are generally dark and dreary, Clear Sky is actually rather nice. By comparison, I mean. It's still the Zone, after all. It feels a bit out-of-place compared to the other two, but given that this is a prequel and things aren't as bad yet, it's to be expected. The mutants are still there, so it's not too different, but it is certainly noticeable.All that being said, I still think Clear Sky is a fun game. If you can deal with the grenades, the different atmosphere, and the gameplay changes from SoC, you shouldn't have any problems at all with it. Be warned that it is a STALKER game, and is prone to bugs and crashes. I got lucky and only had two with this one, as opposed to CoP which wouldn't launch for the longest time, and SoC which crashed several times and wouldn't let me begin a new game without freezing until I messed with the options. If these happen to you, the very first things you should try are running Steam as administrator, disabling the Steam overlay while in-game, and switching the lighting options to Static. Those will solve a large amount of the issues you'll encounter.			"

												After 6 years people still think Chernobyl is in Russia 10/10EDIT Since people actually voted this review to go to the top I will write a normal review to it below !This game is set in chernobyl few years after the incident. Because of the radiation a lot of weird things happen , anomalies , mutated animals and other monsters and the most important thing , the artefacts which are small valuable objects made from the anomalies. You are a STALKER , a person who came to the ""Zone"" (area around chernobyll) to risk your life and get those valuable artefacts. In this game you will do a lot of things , make missions , fight people , fight animals etcThis game doesn't have any PRG mechanics but It doesn't need them , you have a whole map to exlpore , do mission and collect artefacts which you can then sell and upgrade your gear of buy new things.A new thing that was added was fraction system where you can choose a fraction and you can fight other factions , although that sounds really good I don't like the way it was made because even if you clear out a map of enemy troops and you leave the area 10 min later you will get a notification that an outpost is under attack even doe you cleared out the whole area which I personally hate!They also added a new feature which I really like which is upgrading your gear so now money is actually really useful not like in SOC where after some time money was basiclly useless but now you need a lot of money and I found that it's way harder to get the money as well To people who are returning form SOC there are few diffrences in this game like for example collecting artefacts which you can't see them no more , now you have to take out your artefact detector and come close to an anomaly and pray that there is one in there which personaly I don't like that system because artefacts are now super rare and It's rare that you actually get one that you can use for yourself.I reccomend this game to everyone! 10/10			"

Immersive & unsettling // Recommended for horror-survival enthusiasts looking for a challenge*As I am reviewing the core product, and not various third-party mods, this review is based on a purely vanilla playthrough. Please keep that in mind, thank you!+ Many locations and characters from Shadow of Chernobyl make a reappearance in this title+ Equipment and weight limitations do much to force the optimization of one's gear, and make one choose what to discard and what to keep; this leaves the player feeling both challenged and rewarded as they acclimate to the concept+ Artifacts add slight RPG-like stat combinations; these are more challenging to use than in the previous installment, though many will enjoy the increase in challenge+ Very, very strong sense of atmosphere pervading throughout+ Boasts a large and active modding community (many mods do well to address some of the game's various pitfalls)+ Ambient sounds are absolutely fantastic, and keep the player consistently unsettled+ Manner of interaction with various game-world NPCs is largely determined by the player's actions throughout the adventure; can join and help differing factions, netting different rewards (friendly factions will even show up occasionally if you're in a firefight, and they will aid you)+ The game's world and atmosphere complements an intriguing plot; the story, itself, rewards inquisitiveness+ Absolute plethora of side-missions+ The game's environments are vast and very detailed; visuals, too, are crisp and the lighting mechanics excellent+ Fast travel is included (for a fee, unfortunately)+ Finding artifacts, as compared to the game's predecessor, is a new and unique challenge- Lip syncronization is absolutely atrocious- Hunger and thirst has been removed; some may view this as a positive, but as this series tends to attract the purists in the RPG community, most would likely see this as a negative- Bullet mechanics can often be questionable in behavior- Crouching, much like in the first installment, is laughable; one's character lowers by perhaps an inch, and it offers virtually no protection in any given situationLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												Head back into The Zone, taking on bandits and the military as you explore the environments from the first game. Sounds fun enough?Well, the enjoyment you get from STALKER games is dependent on whether or not you're able to overlook and put up with all manner of errors, bugs and little idiosyncracies. I'm talking enemies with pistols turned into sniper rifles, a lack of healing items and grenades that land right at your feet from hundreds of feet away. These are amazingly atmospheric games and the worlds they have are so believable and well crafted it's just a shame that they quite often don't function the way they're supposed to.Clear Sky is the black sheep of the series and by that I mean it's the game that most people agree is the weakest of the three. I still give this one a thumbs up because there really is nothing else like it and it is worth playing the entire trilogy if you're into them at all.But this is still a deeply flawed game and you might want to check out some mods to get it running smoothly and make it a bit more forgiving.Full video review:

												Catching up on my PC video gaming has been something of a spiritual journey for me. I have found my highs, my lows and then there has been a special place that doesn’t quite measure on the spectrum. S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Clear Sky seems to take that measurement system and throw it out the 10th storey window. I want to put it somewhere on the bar with the likes of Half-Life 2, but then no, it doesn’t quite add up. Whilst the game mechanics are very similar at times, I find myself comparing it more to Metro:2033… then again it often feels more like Fallout 3. There’s no denying it has similarities but doesn’t quite match any of them individually. The game has found a very small pocket within the genre to carve out its own place in game history as a deftly challenging, gritty & unique game. It combines elements of successful titles and throws them all together creating something new, inspiring, very challenging & brutal. It is proof of truly evolved gaming that was made by gamers who have a great understanding of games & have refined it in a very Russian way. Cold, calculative & ultimately, brilliant.			"

												Good game, I can see why some people hate it though. Since faction quests in this game just mess up the game. I sided with Freedom, and I had to deal with bandits/duty etc making the game 10X more difficult than it should have been. Also there is a main quest area where bandits take your stuff.. you get them back, but NOT the money! I lost a ton of cash with that, since I was stockpiling it. Best to go through that part first before farming, and DO NOT join ANY faction. Unless you like a good ""challenge"". The length is about the same as SoC and longer than CoP, and, in my opinion, bigger than CoP since the zones are smaller and more numerous. Way more side quests in CS due to more areas, much like the original SoC, weapon upgrade system (another bad part of joining a faction, it limits your upgrades) revamped artifact finding, better inventory facelift, graphical improvements, etc. I DO intend on replaying this one as well since I will not make the mistake of joining a faction. :P So this review is more of a reminder to myself than anything else. :D			"

												I am a huge fan of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, and Clear Sky is by far my favorite. I'm unsure why but I really enjoy the faction warring for territory theme this game focused on. it still holds the brooding atmosphere and the dangerous creatures along with the RPG elements we all enjoyed from Shadow of Chernobyl. This is another must have for fans of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise.			"

												Probably one of the most intense and realistic post-apocalyptic games i've played. It is a brilliant survival game, just figuring out how to stay alive in the world was a challenge in itself and the story is compelling as well. I would consider to be one of my favorite recent games and that is saying a lot since I like a variety of game types.

												""Clear Sky"" is brutal, uncompromising, and definitely worth a try.I remember becoming pretty decent at ""Shadow Of Chernobyl."" Maybe I had the difficulty pulled back a bit for that game. I can't quite remember.Even so, I don't remember ""Shadow"" being as downright mean as ""Clear Sky"" feels.You will die. A lot. Continuously. I'm not really exaggerating when I say you should consider saving after anything whatsoever goes in your favor. Clear a group of attackers? Save. Take down a single hostile? Save. Walk forward for 30 seconds without getting irradiated, falling into an anomaly, chewed up by dogs, or shot? Save. Stand still for a few moments without anything bad happening? Save. Hear anything even mildly ""story-based"" in a conversation? Save. Just successfully saved a game? Save again.Seriously, I was more adept at hitting F5 than the default run-toggle key after only a short time.And be aware that it's possible (though unlikely) to save a game that won't completely reload. The engine will get to the ""Synchronizing"" stage and then hang.Save multiple saves at multiple times.Oh, and you think you're pretty good with guns in videogames? Yeah - about that. In Clear Sky, here's how it works: Your enemies, even the dirt-poor bandits, fire munitions that can apparently home in on you in the dark from across the map. This behavior extends to individual shotgun pellets. Also, their grenades are seemingly possessed of a malevolent intelligence that WILL find you. Through walls. In the dark.Now, for your part, any weapon that is not a sniper rifle fired from the prone position has about an 80% chance of MISSING whatever it is you're trying to kill. You will fire entire magazines - and I'm talking about one shot at a time, not full-auto - and every bullet but one will guide itself to a point that is not the thing in your crosshairs. If you do hit something by micraculous happenstance, you will have to hit it many MANY times before it drops. This applies to the aforementioned bandits, and the well-equipped military. (It's just that the military kills you faster and takes twice the lead before they drop.) With the notable exception of the Bloodsuckers, any hostile you encounter can be expected to behave as though they were made of solid steel and wearing armor of similarly solid steel.You, of course, are made of wet tissue-paper. Some decent armor will upgrade you to dry cardboard. The thin kind, I mean. Not the cool stuff that they make shipping boxes with.Oh, and ammunition is pretty scarce. Also expensive. And the stuff you scrounge and sell to the traders? They buy it cheap. Some things they won't even pay you for. What they sell to you, naturally, carries a hefty premium. You can eventually build a stockpile of essentials, but it will take a while. It will also take a while because the fast-travel system (the guides) costs money to use, and you need to save that money for bullets. A trip to a trader that has anything worth buying often requires walking across nearly the whole world.Getting rewards for completed missions also follows that formula. That squad-leader you just risked life and limb for? No, he doesn't have the money with him. You have to walk all the way back to The Cordon for that measly 750 RU. No, he doesn't want to buy anything you have on you, except food and vodka. Have a nice trip! Hope you don't get ambushed on the way!And you should definitely build that ammo stockpile. As soon as you commit to a certain kind of weapon, you will go up against a horde of enemies that are carrying weapons chambered for whatever you DON'T prefer. It's almost uncanny.Also, before getting rolled up into the endgame, make sure you have all the best gear that exists in the world. Otherwise, you will be like me. You'll get all the way to Chernobyl, and then the game will become effectively unwinnable because you're up against nearly invincible enemies that warp in and can magically shoot around cover. You will need lots of bandages - as in, every single one you can find, and probably ten more. Plus every medkit you can get your hands on, and the best armor in the game. All that, and 1000 rounds of AR ammo. And every bullet you can possibly get for two different sniper rifles. You might have a chance.All of the above sounds terrifying and awful, but I also have to say something else: ""Clear Sky"" is oddly compelling. It took me almost 27 hours of getting abused by the game before I finally decided that I didn't care. Up to that point, I was thoroughly engrossed. The bleak, strange, and unsettling environment is intriguing, and the overall challenge somehow manages to make you want to try again (most of the time). Oh, and when the game decides to mess with your mind, it REALLY succeeds.So, give ""Clear Sky"" a shot. Several shots, actually. Like I said, good luck with actually HITTING anything.Geeze.			"

												(**EDIT** I just finished the game, and lemme say, if you haven't played the first game, the ending will not make sense. Even if you have played the first game, the ending is not very satisfying. In my opinion, you should get your enjoyment out of the rest of the game, because there isn't much to be found at the end.)Rough, somewhat broken, but with a little love is simply fantastic. It's atmosphere is unmatched, it draws you in like your character's body draws in radiation. Also, the voice acting is meh, but that's part of why we love STALKER.Vanilla, the game has many glitches, ugly models and textures, super accurate and powerful enemies, innacurate and weak player weaponry, and questionable design decisions, but mods and a bit of technical know-how can turn this game into something beautiful. Well, maybe it's not visually beautiful how I run it, but I enjoyed it thoroughly nonetheless. I personally can recommend Clear Sky Complete mod, as well as The Road to Limansk. You can find both of those mods on the ModDB page for Clear Sky (Road to Limank says that it hasnt released yet; it has, just follow the links on the page).Also, you should get STALKER: Lost Alpha, a free fan remake of Shadow of Chernobyl, with loads of lore-friendly added content. I never played SoC, so I can't compare the two, but hey, it's free. Also, be sure to get Boredgunner's Lost Alpha Mod Pack 2014, which updates all weapon models, animations and sounds, adds 50-ish new weapons, and tweaks the economy to be more fair in terms of pricing and item availability (among other things... check out his ModDB page at http://www.moddb.com/games/stalker/downloads/lost-alpha-mod-pack-2014) . I am having a blast playing Lost Alpha, and you should be playing it too!			"

												I'm just going to stress that Clear Sky isn't as good as Shadow of Chernobyl or Call of Pripyat. It has numerous problems. Not the least of which is just a lack of focus. It recycles half of Shadow of Chernobyl's maps and has a less interesting story to boot.However, bearing all that in mind it is priced 10$ cheaper and features a rather unique ""faction war"" mechanic. This mechanic essentially has it so that all the different factions in the Zone do battle with each other in real time. The player can join a faction if they so desire, and doing so gives them ready access to better equipment and more friendly areas in the Zone. All in the hopes of taking over the Zone through pure conquest.The faction war mechanic is extremely well done in this game, and is the reason why anyone plays Clear Sky to this day. Whether it is worth getting is really up to you, since it is the awkward middle child in the series.			"

												A story from when I had a non-Steam copy of the game, that I posted as a comment in a thread back in 2013:""I do have one specific memory of Clear Sky being creepy.I was wandering around in the Red Forest, minding my own business. I noticed it was getting close to night, so I made my way to the group of Duty guys at the edge of the forest. When I got there, there were 2 of them dead, and one bleeding out on the ground.I heard dogs, and saw them dragging one of the dead bodies back into the forest. Then, I heard a bloodsucker woosh from behind, and immediately ran to the guy bleeding out, healed him, and we tried to fight together.That didn't last long as he got killed by the bloodsucker just 5 seconds after I healed him. I ran to the building, went up the stairs, basically cornered myself to the wall, got out my shotgun, and waited until morning. Every now and then, I would think the bloodsucker was gone, try to leave, only to hear that grunting/snorting sound and a woosh again, reminding me to stay put.Eventually, it was morning, a lone Duty guy came back to take the building over again and it was over.Remember, this was all while it was pitch black out at night and before I even knew what a bloodsucker was.""Edit: changed ""the"" to ""that""			"

Cons-Lots of bugs (not to the point where it's unplayable, you just have to save really often and optimally make multiple save files).-Unsatisfying ending.-Enemies will always throw their grenades perfectly at you, it's unreal.Brief descriptionTchernobyl has spoken. The world around you, called the Zone, is now an apocalyptic wasteland, where some Stalkers, survivors of the disaster, have organized in groups to fight for their lives against the wilderness and against each other. But someone went too far up the center of the Zone, and the Zone is not happy. It's reacting by releasing deadly emissions who make no survivors, or almost none. But you have someting special, and you survived the onslaught of the Zone. Your quest, Mercenary Scar, is to reach the center of the Zone and find out how to calm this monstrous ecosystem that is making life on earth hell. Your quest will not be easy, as creepy mutants, zombies, bandits and emissions will try to stand in your way in this first person shooting/survival game. Good luck.Personal opinionI will always have many fond memories of this game, and it will always stay as one of my favorite games of all time. For so many reasons... The graphics, the gameplay, the dialogues, it all just feels like you really are some guy trying to survive in a fearsome world. It all feels so good when you finally succeed in what you are doing. You feel good. You feel good because the game doesn't help you. The game doesn't give you any chances. Hence, when you finally manage to fend off countless waves of mutants or assault a military outpost, you feel like you did it all by yourself, against all odds.VerdictI definitely, absolutely and unquestionnably recommend this game. I loved every part of it, and think you will too. And it's really cheap. 100% worth it.			"

												Now, Part 2 of the revisions. To recap after the 1st stalker game revision....this is based on the vanilla experience.Ah, the prequel. Also, the game that the stalker community thought was forgettable. Me? I personally LOVED this game. Sure, it's missing a few things....namely hunger, and an all-around creepiness with some of the environments. But to counter, this game introduced some features that proved to be worthwhile; for instance, the weapon and armor upgrades and repair. Do the weapons and armor still degrade? Yes, but now you can enhance them with more armor plates, flex the durability, and even add protection against anomalies. It's needed because if you ask me, this is the hardest of the 3 stalker games. Just as is with the first game, once you get to a certain point, there's no turning back. So, be prepared for ANY situation again. The story revolves around Scar, a mercenary that inserts himself into the faction war. Various factions are battling for territory in the zone in a race to reach the center. When a group of stalkers reaches the center, the zone changes and becomes more unstable, making the territory more valuable. Gameplay is relatively the same with a few changes. First, the artifacts aren't just there for the taking this time. You need a detector to find the artifacts, which involves getting into the thick of the anomaly. The weakest detectors won't spot the best artifacts, so you need a top notch one to make up for the weaker ones shortcomings. This game also manages to feel less like a sandbox, only because as you progress through the story you are able to uncover more of the map. In other words, you're actually blocked from progressing far into the zone until you progress through the story. Once you get so far, then it's open for you to explore all over. Numerous players weren't fond of this because of the open nature of the 1st game, but i think it worked well here because it made for better pacing. You couldn't get the best weapon in the game very early, giving you a major advantage. Even the armor suits were paced better, as an exoskeleton suit COULD be given to you about half way through, but required some work on your part in joining the faction wars for Duty or Freedom. Better pacing equals more fun if you ask me. The stalker way is the hard way.Artifacts were not so abundant here, as each map in the zone contained a few anomalies, which hold artifacts. With less artifacts comes less money, which means upgrading or repairing was a little tricky because you had to draw the line between keeping an artifact or trading it in for a valuable upgrade. Less money also equals more fun. Stalker games are supposed to be challenging and this adds another layer of challenge. Of course, once you get so far and have your armor or weapons upgraded, then you can save some money for future use. The AI has some improvements, but still has its pros and cons. The faction wars can be a bit buggy sometimes, as the AI isn't entirely supportive. You may find yourself doing alot of the work, and while this game is difficult as it is, i personally don't mind doing most of the work. It's a shooter.....you shoot things. The more the merrier. Most of the maps are reused from Shadow of Chernobyl, with the addition of a few new ones. The swamps and red forest are the highlights, creating a fresh change from gloomy landscapes to lush vegetation. Also, some of the reoccurring maps have been slightly altered to appear more lifelike. Remember, this takes place before the events of SoC. All in all, i think this game gets a bad rap. What it is missing from other stalker games it makes up for by introducing some iconic stalker features, like the upgrades. Again, mods are a-plenty here, but do yourself a favor and play vanilla first...on MASTER difficulty. It's brutal again, and the difficulty spike is worse this time around in the end, so be even more prepared. While it still may not be every stalker fan's cup of tea, it's still part of the stalker lore that every fan should check out. It's my personal favorite of the 3 games, mostly for the reasons of the pacing and balance. Difficult as hell, borderline rage-inducing in the end, but still worthwhile. Crowning achievement completing this on master. Good luck stalker.9.2/10			"

												Lots of good reviews on this game already so no need for me to spill much ink on the vanilla game.  Shortly i consider this the weakest game in the series - yet it's still head over shoulders better than many other more known FPS games. It's gritty world is unique and i have always had fond memories of this game series  (minus the endings for Clear Sky and Pripyat)... But no more on that.So why do i play this? I play this because of TFW mod (The Faction Wars) - Few know about this awesome mod that gives you a ton of gameplay by removing the story and remaking the world to support factions. It's a free world now yet the area is so familar. In this mod you start out as a loner without any equipment and it's up to you to try to survive. You'll need to eat, sleep and get paid. but that can be hard as there are no freebies in this game contrary to vanilla game. stashes are looted. corpses get looted right after the fighting stops and if you try to grab stuff that someone thinks belong to them they will confront you. Needless to say early game is hard but VERY rewarding. Later you will start doing faction missions - or continue to be a loner. It doesn't matter much what you choose. Point is the options are endless and there are so many routes to choose and before you know it the most limiting factor is your actual free time to play the game. I am looking forward to 50 hours+ of quality game time from this mod alone that executes just right the way faction wars should be.  Here is a good place to start looking at mods that might tickle you the right way: http://cheeki.violates.me/ "

Clear Sky is a masterpiece, not just a game, play atmosphere perfect post-apocalyptic nuclear scenario, the story is epic, very well connected to the original, and the graphics, details, effects and feel of the game can not be described in words. it would be a shame for some people to miss this awesome game to play at least once in their lives. For me S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series is one of the best games played there once in my life My review for Clear Sky, I give 10/10			"

												This review is for people who have played Shadow of Chernobyl.  It's about the single-player campaign, with the Complete mod.  I hope you liked the previous game, because you're essentially about to play it again.  Given that this one is a prequel, there are so many similarities in the environment (which is about 80% the same as the first) that you get a kind of wistful echo of adventures past (or rather, future).  It's a bit interesting to see what various parts of the zone were like before SoC.  You play as Scar, a merc who has survived emissions from the Zone for some unknown reason.  Once again you're chasing Strelok (really!?!).  The first time he entered the heart of the zone it set off an emission which was similar to a small cataclysm, setting all the factions against each other.  Your objective is to prevent him from doing it again, which would possibly produce a lethal emission killing everyone.  The new wrinkle this time is the faction system.  It's really just an extension of the old system, with some capture the flag type elements.  You can even take part in the initial war between Duty and Freedom this time around if you like.  Although the rewards are meager for this type of activity, it nonetheless makes the zone a far more dynamic place than it used to be, with NPC's shifting around constantly depending on who wins what fights.  Inconsequential, but you do get this vague sense that you have a hand in shaping the zone.  The combat system is still bull****.  I hope you weren't expecting any serious improvements.  Bullets still go wherever the **** they want, even with the Dragunov on occasion.  Enemy AI is just as bad, possibly a little worse (and that's with a patch to improve it!).  Even so, it is definitely satisfying getting the headshots with a scoped weapon.  This time around you can actually upgrade your weapons at various smiths, and find schematics to deliver to the appropriate npcs in order to get specific upgrades.  Kinda neat, and meant to extend the life of the game, but wholly unnecessary.  Same goes for your typical stash drops, which are now a part of NPC dialogues.  Fork over some dough for the information, and most of the time they'll tell you what's in it before you even leave camp.  You'll still reload frequently, but nowhere near as much or nearly as rage-inducing as the first game.  I can't testify as to how bad the final mission is (remember the last one on SoC?).  My game permanently crashed on all saves about two areas before the end, so I had to watch the ending on Youtube.  It was moderately unsatisfactory, and frankly I'm glad that I didn't have to worry about however bad the last mission was probably going to be.  A lot of other stuff is recycled.  The game looks a little better, but you can tell they didn't particularly try.  If you look at my play-time, I'm guessing it's about the same length as the first, maybe even a little shorter.  The shelf life was no doubt meant to be extended via multiplayer and dynamic zone faction wars.  This is Shadow of Chernobyl 1.5, essentially.  How much you liked the first game will directly determine if you like the second.			"

												Can't believe I've never reviewed this game as the STALKER series is my favorite of all time.  It is recommended that you play Shadow of Chernobyl first, but not a must.  Although reguarded as the worst of the three, I still think it is a must play.  The beginning is slow and the ending is unfairly hard, with the everything in the middle being one of the most unique out of the three. Faction wars brings a whole new mechanic to the table. As long as you don't finish them completely off, one of the most immersive to me.  There are a few bugs in the game, and after finishing the vanilla game I played it with the STALKER Complete Mod.  This to me is a bugfix and not really a mod, since it really keeps the immersion of the vanilla game.=Open world atmospheric thriller =Side  quests and pda function more appropriately=Improved map and Pda=Weather is superbThe big downsdie to Clear Sky is the ending.  Yes there is a point of no return and if you are not prepared you may not be able to beat it. It is hard, ruthless and unforgiving.  Depending on your point of view you may be disappointed with the ending as well.  But in this game, its the journey, not exactly the ending that is memorable.Still a 9.9/10, and a must play.			"

												The second game in the series, but the first chronologically (being a prequel), this game is by far the most underrated of the series. 9/10, if you ask a S.T.A.L.K.E.R's least favorite game in the series... it's this one, it gets a lot of hate for the fact that on release it was very unoptimized and buggy and there really wasn't any workaround for it. But now, of course, like any other game in the series, a ton of mods are available for us to choose from and almost all of them include bug fixes and optimization features. Some of them stop there, upgrading the graphics a little, optimizing the game for you, and fixing common bugs and issues. Others, however, expand on the open faction system that this prequel provides. Unlike in Shadow of Chernobyl, this game allows you to interact openly and work with the factions outside of their main quest lines, going as far as joining them after reaching a certain status; and that's not just Duty and Freedom, that's almost any faction in the game.The story, while not expanding too much on the events its predecessor, provide a little insight into what was going on in Shadow of Chernobyl and why it was happening, as well as revealing to you (Scar) information that Strelok did not know at the time. Don't get me wrong, Strelok is a cool guy, but Scar is probably my favorite character of the series. Either way, don't ignore this game because of earlier setbacks and whatnot, with the mods you have available now you can experience the game in almost a completely vanilla state (if you so wish) with all of the bugs and unoptimized mess fixed and cleaned up.Again, an excellent series; the story, atmosphere, characters, and mod variety all make it worth its price. Tons of replayability to be had.			"

												Note: This review is for the vanilla Stalker Clear Sky.Stalker Clear Sky is the prequel entry to the series, the game has you play as a Merc named Scar, who survives a large emission storm and is trying to find Strelok before he reaches the center of the zone. Stalker Clear Sky is a hit and miss for many fans of the series as it introduces some great ideas and makes some questionable decisions. While many consider the intro segment an example of the games flaws, I did not find myself dying that much but I can see why players dislike Clear Sky. The intro segment in the swamps is unlike any Stalker game as it has the player in a specific area, running errands, and doing very little exploring. Getting into gunfights more frequently and constantly finding myself against large enemy groups with a double barrel was kinda ridiculous. There are also a lot of questionable decisions which would leave new players to the series baffled as the first entry route to Cordon will have a player against an army base and the player was suppose to know to take a different path in. Minor decisions like that are what makes Clear Sky a fustrating experience. Another horrible decision was to make bandages rare as heck and needing mutiple amounts of them to plug up one injury. Clear Sky does however bring the faction system and uses it fairly well. Players are encouraged to join factions to gain access to better gear and is a core aspect of the game. The PDA is better in Clear Sky compared to SoC. Clear Sky however performs the worst of all Stalker games as I had constant crashes and error messages in my playthrough. Interesting to note is that Clear Sky looks the best of all vanilla Stalker games as it has some impressive dynamic lighting, great amount of vegetation on screen with an impressive draw distance. Pros:- The new faction system is a good idea and used well.- Weapons can be upgraded and modified.- Large amount of Hub worlds compared to the other Stalkers.- Many factions exist to make the faction system useful.- The FoV effect/motion blur when reloading and moving looks amazing.- Visually impressive for a near decade old game.- Great to revisit areas before the events of the first game.- Gunplay is tight and requires players to play slow.Cons:- No hunger system, this makes food an alternative to medical kits which makes no sense whatsoever.- Bandages and Anti rad became rare which can create very fustrating moments of dying slowly.- The worst intro segment in any Stalker game and maybe difficult enough to make players quit out right.- Auto save is poor so spam that F5 key.- The akward natural difficulty curve of the game may throw off players.- Crash city and error messages galore.- Bugs.- While the gunplay is tight, pistols cannot have aim down sights...- Ai has the habit in the starting sequence of turning shotguns into sniper rifles while you cannot do the same (get some slugs).- No tutorial so please new comers do not get this game first.Clear Sky isn't the worst game I have played and is enjoyable at times. However, the many questionable decisions that Clear Sky made in its game can make it a test of patience and sometime push it a little too far. Clear Sky does get easier as the player progresses and while Clear sky does not differ to much from SoC, SoC executed its concepts/mechanics correctly. SoC may have a difficult beginning segment also, but the way SoC handled healing items and made the difficulty scale naturally was great. Certain areas in SoC were loaded with harder enemies so you came back when you had the gear to go toe to toe with them. Clear Sky throws military units armed with AKs or Akabans whIle you just managed to leave the beg inning hub world. Clear Sky has some idea of what SoC was trying to do but is recommended for the veteran Stalker player. If your new to the series, start with SoC or heck even CoP, but save Clear Sky for last cause it will smack you around.			"

												I'm a huge Fallout fan so when I heard this saga was similar, I know I should try it.I decided to  play this one because the other STALKER games are more expensive (20 bucks), and since I didn't want to potentially waste money  in a game, I decided to buy this one (cost me only 4 bucks),First of all, there's a big difference between Fallout and STALKER, the Fallout series they kinda... grab your hand through the game explaining the basic stuff, sure you have to explore and play for hours to fully understand the game but it lends you a hand with stuffs like weapons or what to do next, and that's what I love about fallout you can play 1 hour one week, rest for 1 week, and then play another hour the next week and you won't forget what you were doing.But in STALKER, ♥♥♥♥ is real.They don't explain ♥♥♥♥, you start the game and good ♥♥♥♥in luck.You don't know how to avoid anomalies? well ♥♥♥♥ you.What the ♥♥♥♥ is this thing you just grab? I don't ♥♥♥♥in knowYou don't know what to do next? go and play ♥♥♥♥er, die and die until you learn what to do.Fallout is easier to digest, but STALKER is the real ♥♥♥♥.If I had to choose between STALKER and FALLOUT I'd said BOTH PLEASE!.Please download CLEAR SKY COMPLETE as soon as you buy this game, is a mod that fixes some  minor issues and add HD textures.final score: ♥♥♥♥ I don't know, just buy it damn it you won't regret it.

												I would recommend to skip this one if you haven't played the other two games. Clear Sky is the weakest game of the beloved S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game franchise and without mods you might find yourself not fighting the menaces of the Zone, but the constant bugs that hinder you from finishing quests.

												Not the best STALKER title, but it focuses more on fanctions and the actual previous history of The Zone. I recommened installing mods like Complete and Oblivion Lost. Enemies are very smart which I found quite fun cause it makes you do strategic retreats and flanking. Its cheap so I would recommend trying it.			"

												   My recorded playtime is not reflective of actual playtime. I've bought Clear Sky twice now, and I play a modded version now.    So first, I'll give a review of the game by itself, then add a little something for the vets.This is a great tactical fps and rpg game. The gun mechanics feel so good in this game. It's not like most games where bullet spread and accuracy is just enough enough of a factor to notice it in game. Here you you really have to have good aim, and you have to stabilize your gun before you fire. Getting into a battle with a couple bandits with a shotgun in this game feels more epic and real than anything you'll see in a COD or Battlefield or just about any other shooter. The AI is just awesome. Taking cover, blind fire, flanking, retreating, grenades, camping, even sneaking on a rare occasion. The combat mechanics are my favorite part of this game; every gun feels different and realistic, and every encounter gets the adrenalin going.    The art is another thing, some people find the game ugly, but I think it's got the best sun rays and dynamic effects I've ever seen. They had volumetric fog in this around the same time as the AAA games started getting it. There is nothing like the zone though, I find myself screenshotting a lot in this game. Seeing water stream down walls and the sunrays through trees or windows... it's just a beautiful game.     The story is great too, but it is mostly an addition to the story of Call of Chernobyl. That game had a bit of a better story with the whole ""Kill Strelok"" mission, but this one simply adds to that. What this story does better than the other STALKER games, and heres where I start talking to the vets, is it takes you through the areas of the zone at a much more balanced and compelling pace. It kinda funnels you through these scenarios that slowly feel more and more epic, because of the gameplay challenges presented.      Now with all that said, I think this is the best of the STALKER games, and I think it's worthy to note that it is cheaper than the others last I saw. Of course they all have their own merits and flaws but I like the mechanics the best in this one, and the challenge. I also believe that it has the best mods available for it, there's a few that combine it with the first stalker which is just perfect I think.			"

												Looking for a good open world post apocalyptic type game? Look no further. S.T.A.L.K.E.R Clear Sky allows you to explore the map for hours slaying mutants as you go, help NPCs complete tasks, join one of the factions such as Clear Sky, Duty, Freedom, Bandits, Renegades,  and Stalkers. (Personally I chose Bandits) And help the factions claim their side of ""The zone."" This game is buggy however, but the bugs are too funny to be removed in my opinion. Overall, I would highly recommend buying this game.			"

												I played this game a lot before Steam started recording hours, should say 50+. I actually enjoyed this Stalker more than Pripyat, still not as good as the first one though, like most games. If you loved the first one, you'll still love this one! Play though it once without mods and then when you come back to it a year later, put a nice mod like LURKER or Complete on.Pros-Blowouts-Better graphics than SoC-Faction wars is a lot of fun-Stalker setting-Old/new areas-New gunsCons-All the Stalker games have had bugs here and there, CS is no exception			"

												Heard about this game from youtube. Did some research, and bought it on sale in steam. Before I played, I donned the traditional gopnik flat cap and slav squatted for the whole game. I played this game with NO fixes. NO mods. Master difficulty. You drop into the game with a little cinematic, and it looks... EEEEH. You spawn in and these random science gopniks tell you ""you should be dead but you're not so get gun and go in swamp ♥♥♥♥♥.""At this point I had no idea what was going on, so I got my gun, and headed into swamp. Instantly, I noticed my main gun had 30 rounds of ammo, and this sets precedent for the entire game. You have NO AMMO. And, to make things worse, all the guns are peashooters that, even with a 1.6x scope, you can't hit a dinner plate from 10 yards.So the thing that made this game unique was it's AI system and environment. The AI is so cool, fighting it out even when you aren't there. securing the swamp for the science gopniks was easy because they did all the work for me. But as soon as I thought AYYY this isn't as hard as people say, I made it out of the swamp and went to the cordon. This game does not hold your hand. it doesn't tell you ""go north to avoid the gun"" it says ""FIGURE IT OUT YOURSELF ♥♥♥♥♥"" as I went north, I encountered a squad of Renegades. All I had was a hunting rifle, which is GARBAGE at ranges, and one of them had a Viper 5. It took me 30 minutes to defeat them. this is where you get introduced to your good friends f5 and f9.F5 quicksaves. You should do this A TON. The game never autosaves, and added onto the difficulty, this can be hell. But if you get past that one squad that you've been fighting after 15 minutes, the feeling is SO GREAT. Skipping ahead, I had arrived at Agroprom, and I joined duty and beat freedom. After that, I headed to the place that enters the Red Forest. that's where the atmosphere really hit me. It's so good looking and fits perfectly. For all this complaining I cannot reccomend this game enough. The game is hard, but it rarely is unfair.EDIT: After thinking the review over, I am changing my review to an 8/10. This game has some flaws. I haven't tried SOC, but with this game, my hopes could not be higher.			"

												Stalker Shadow of Chernobyl (SoC) is one of my all-time favourite games I have played thus far – even made it as one of my top ten of all times. Blends with FPS, survival and a touch of role playing elements, it was brutal, yet enjoyable experience. So when I hear that the next Stalker game was on the horizon (instead of waiting for seven years), I couldn’t wait to see what GSC Game World have in store. Well, just a year later, along arrives Stalker, Clear Sky (CS) – a prequel to SoC and sadly, also a lessor game in most areas as the new features like Faction Wars just didn’t pan out effectively.Like most open world games, it’s hard to say how long to beat it. For me, as I like to do literally everything and explore every nook and cranny, took me about 65 hours to complete, so I can safely assume average will be around 20 or so. Pretty decent with a good array of missions / side quests and diversions, CS is unfortunately a step down from SoC. The new features like Faction Wars and able to customise your weapons did not pan out well enough as actually, they are more of a hindrance or simply, not worth investing your time. However the emission blowout was pretty awesome due to its sudden nature. So if you are coming from SoC, expect to be disappointed however if this is your first Stalker game, it’s an enjoyable ride but expect spoilers. I guess you can view CS as a rock and a hard place.Full review here: http://www.gamespot.com/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-clear-sky/user-reviews/2200-12643375/7.5 / 10			"

												The atmosphere is great, as in any STALKER game, and things are up to the level of SoC and CoP for a while.Until you decide to get involved in the faction wars (extremely bugged) or until you reach the last 25% of the story: then it's just a military shooter, where enemies will home their granades right between your eyes. Tons and tons of human enemies to kill, but the atmosphere is completely lost.What made SoC and CoP great games was slowly passing though abandoned towns and desolated landscapes, looking for precious artifacts and watching your back from bloodsuckers and other mutants. If you want this in CS, you need to really force it upon the game.On top of that, mind that most (all?) maps and locations are the same of SoC. I played SoC some 4/5 years ago and still got lots of deja vu. It can be nice, realising that you actually know this or that place, but feels a bit lazy somehow.Overall, I recommend it to STALKER veterans who want a challenge, but perhaps CoP with mods is a better choice. In any case, do not forget to install the Sky Reclaimation Project to fix bugs and enhance the experience.If you have never played a STALKER game, play Shadow of Chernobyl and Call of Prypjat first. Those are the real deal.			"

												Ever since a young age I have been playing the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series and to this day I play and love each of the three games. I've completed them all countless times and still enjoy the fantastic moody and eerie atmosphere. It's open-world and features and inventory with equippable weapons and protective suits all of which are upgradable and have conditions which must be repaired. The best way I could describe this game is like a Ukrainian twist on the Fallout games. The story isn't fantastic, voice acting is minimal and the game isn't a refined masterpiece but every gameplay element makes up for it from searching for rare artifacts to helping your faction in faction wars. The world is large and full of action and exploration in each part. With the amount of hours I've spent in this game both on steam and the retail copy I owned, I feel that it's worth every penny I spent.			"

The second part of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series: ""Clear Sky"" The prehistory of ""Shadow of Chernobyl""...You are playing the mercenary ""Scar"" (german: Narbe). Once you were outside when a big anomaly explosion happens, you survived in a mysterious way, you were found by the leader of the Clear Sky faction Lebedew. He declared you, why the anomalies have to stop (else you would also die, so you have no choice).You find out that, a guy named Strelok made it behind the ""brain smelter"" - this is the reason, why those anomalies happen.I have to stop now, I don't want to spoil you :-)You are going through known areas like: the red forest, the dump and the Kordon. You also see other and new places like: the hospital, the swamp and the city Limansk.++ it's still a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game++ you can drink also here vodka++ map design is beautiful and huge++ fast travel!! (but it costs)++ not a bit less in atmosphere+ the sounds are ok (better in the first part)+ improved voice-acting+ improved graphics+ the night... is dark. Not like in the first part+ more weapons (...don't say that they are better)+ really challenging sometimes (also on normal)+ you can fight for your faction and have to defend your facilities against your enemies and even mutantsbut, I have to say...- these faction or defending tasks get really fast irritating and boring- the KI has sometimes the IQ of a toast... a wet toast- loads of bugs, so make more than 2 save games- the story is a little bit... incomprehensible- ""only"" one end. First part had 7 endings.""Clear Sky"" is a worthy successor of ""Shadow of Chernobyl"" - but, the negatives aspects like the end, the bugs or the comparison to the first part... makes me to give ""Clear Sky"" only 7/10. But it is still a good and nice game! :-)			"

												This is still my favorite among the (very good) Stalker games. It gives you everything from the other parts plus factions. You really feel like part of a larger world that you are influencing as you want to. At the same time, there is the pressure from the recurring emissions that will eventually kill you and you share the need of the zone itself to solve the problem. Again, being something almost like an ""avatar"" of the zone (sry for spoilers), you feel like part of something greater.Got this in a game bundle for a fraction of the normal price but it is still worth the full price as well.

 S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky  Clear Sky is a good game however has a lot of shortcomings in optimization. The game can drag on for many hours of fun by performing the side missions. This part is no different practically nothing as the previous one but there are plenty of new stuff. The game has been improved graphically however it is not well optimized. Night are darker and even we have access to fast traveling of course for a price. We will also visit the new areas of Zona such as swamps or Limansk however in this part there is no Pripyat :(. Weapons and suits are the same however we are able join to different factions such as the Freedom, Duty, Clear Sky, bandits or stalkers. Soundtrack irritated me because it was too dynamic but after few hours i got used to this. The main character of the game is nameless mercenary working for the Clear Sky faction and our task is to prevent disaster. The game is certainly good and above all it is not until such a way to buy especially in some pack from humble bundle or on the other site.  "

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky is a great post-apocalytpic game. It has an amazingly large world, full of mutants, and characters, and radiation, and whatever you can think of in a post-apocalyptic game. It has a great atmosphere that makes you feel like you're actually in the post-apocalyptic time period, and I recommend it. This game can be a little annoying sometimes, because of how challenging the combat is, and how hard it is to afford new weapons and supplies, but that only adds to the realism and atmosphere of a post-apocalyptic game. People say it's the worst out of the series, and if it is, the rest of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games must be amazing. It has a photo realistic world, and it's very fun to explore it. If you have ten dollars, you should definitely get this game.			"

												Let me get this out right out: S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadows of Chernobyl is one of my favourite games of all time.Clear Sky, however, isn't. They took everything that made SoC interesting, it's bleak atmosphere and ruthlesness and just made me shoot bandits in a swamp which is to date the worst setting for a game. It's not interesting, it's not compelling; it's just you shooting. Bandits. In a swamp. Which by the way is the worst place to shoot anything at.Such a miss after a great game. Completed it (the ending isn't exactly surprising since it's a prologue) out of sheer willpower. All the elements that made the first game so good were absent. Boring missions, boring setting, bore everywhere.I really can't recommend Clear Sky to even the most hardcore STALKER fan since it gives you nothing. You literally play exposition. And not in a fun way.			"

												Many people consider this to be the worst of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R franchise, but I honestly love this game more than the other two. It may be because this was the first one I played, but i always found it to be great compared to the two because of the faction wars, the hunting of artifacts, the areas, and the story. Don't get me wrong, the other games were amazing in some of these fields, but clear sky really gave me the feeling of being in a crazy place while being invested in the story and places I went. I did encounter a bug which forced me to play the entire game all over again (thanks lefty) but it allowed me to redo my work and actually get more than what I had before. Aside from that bug, I've had a rather smooth playthrough compared to what other people have experienced. I don't know if these were anomalies (bad joke) from the rest of the crowd, but be wary of the chance anything could happen and constantly save and have your backups. This game isn't perfect, but i guess the bias I have for it being my first S.T.A.L.K.E.R  makes it shine from the rest. Give it a try, you probably won't regret it!			"

												An amazing game that was, and somewhat still is, grossly overlooked due to its seemingly older graphics (X-Ray 1.5 engine). However the gameplay and atmosphere more than make up for it. This game was, and still is, simply brilliant! The entire S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-series is one awesome ride!^^^ POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING ^^^Not sure what exactly pet peeved some people into disliking this particular one in the trilogy, but I believe that of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise, this is an amazing ´sequel´ to the Shadow of Chernobyl.I use the term losely in this concept, as Clear Sky takes place prior to the events of SoC, yet is the 2nd installment in the trilogy (red.)CS brings in the familiar tone and setting from the SoC and along with it, a shít-ton of new features (and bugs).Right off the bat; this game is not perfect, however it is damn near perfection when modded properly for more realistic lighting, shadow, texture and sounds - however I suggest newcomers to experience the vanilla game beforehand.The story - which can be read/summerised in the wiki-page - is nothing unusual. In fact, SoC had somewhat of a more interesting angle to the protagonist than CS. Nonetheless, it´s still manages to draw you in.As someone who´s obsessed with snipers, CS offers a even larger variety in the gamplay, with the added feature of modding your weapons! From a simple reduction in recoil of your guns, to more accuracy and flatness (projectile speed) and undermounted grenade launcher, you can customize almost any given weapon to fit your needs/style. Add the choice to attack a scope to nearly any rifle, you can turn a full automatic AK into a mid-range sniper rifle. Granted, I wouldn´t go with an AK due to their terribly low accuracy, but just as an example.NOTE! Most first tier modifications are available at nearly any weapon smith. To unlock the 2nd and last tier, you´ll need the blueprints/schiematics in form of USB-drives (that´s right, bítches, it´s USB sticks).These can be obtained from loot spots (backpacks, boxes, supplies or others), which you can learn about from either PDAs on enemies or buying the info from bartenders or other NPCs.Another option is doing missions - main or side, they will reward you occasionally with a USB, unlocking mod possibilities for various weapons - and even armor!Artifacts, bítches! Get em while they´re hot!The enemies vary from a simple bandit in Addidas track suit, taking pot shots at you with a 9mm well beyond it´s accuracy threshold, to SVD Dragunov wielding bullet sponges in exoskeletal armor to psy-enhances mutants, with the power to debilitate and kill even the most hardened veteran of the Zone, should you be unlucky enough.NOTE! I found shotguns to be particularly useful at point blank when dealing with almost any mutants. Thanks to the spread, it made zig-zag´ing dogs and bloodsuckers(!) easier to deal with. Bloodsuckers are even tougher than in SoC. At least in my experience. They seem to be circling around you in an effort to distract and avoid gunfire more frequently than the SoC-variations.The factions and their disputes are on much larger scale than SoC, meaning you´ll have plenty of oppertunities to either push or prevent a certain faction to advance or retreat. Ultimately you can wipe out entire factions, should you be so bold. (still not certain if it was intended as an option in the game or not. Could be part of a mod. Might edit if any news should present itself)The locations are almost identical to the SoC with a few improvements and changes in the direction of progress. Still that eerie and gloomy tone and ambience to really make it more fun plaing all alone in complete darkness. It´s called immersion, I´m told.Conclusion: Outstanding game which deserves every praise and attention it gets!			"

												Clear Sky is an entertaining game that expands on Shadow of Chernobyl (SoC).The story, atmosphere, and sounds are still on point. I found it strange that you end up fighting humans a lot more than dungeon crawling and fighting mind-controlling mutants in this game. This game also introduces a faction war system, which is pretty cool. It gives me more people to shoot at with my ultra-high accuracy rifle.If you're bothered by the wacky, inaccurate aiming system, I suggest you use the hunting rifle until you get a more accurate weapon. You can steal an AC-96 from the military people (South Cordon) and upgrade it (with scope and silencer). Then, use that until you get an F-200M and upgrade that. Also, always aim for the head. 1-3 hits will always kill.If you need money, sell medical gear, weapons, and artifacts. Artifacts are hard to come by so keep the great ones for yourself. Always be on the lookout for anomalies, pull out your detector (press O) and look for them.This game is hard as hell. You'll be pressing F5 and F9 a lot. But, if you stick with it, you'll be able to get the best equipment in the game and end up... pressing F5/ F9 less often.Also, that incessant buzzing noise from using Night Vision for hours on end is stuck in my brain. It's like a brain scorcher.End game Gear:Weapon: FT200 (upgraded for accuracy) with some worthless pistolArmor: CS-1 (Upgraded for armor and night vision)Detector: VelesArtifacts: Bubble, and the artifacts that give you more endurance and less weight.Faction: FreedomCheeki Breeki			"

												Keep in mind that the game is about 5 or 6 years old so keep that in mind while reading my review. ____PROS- Very nice skybox- Considering how old the game is, the graphics are very good- Interesting faction mechanic - The inventory is simple and good- Map is good enough- Gunfights are pretty tactic and fun- Good price- Menu artwork looks nice____CONS- Enemies lack variety, especialy the mutants- Sometimes you will get damage from radiation but the character doesn't scream so you will die because you didn't notice it- The anomalies mechanic is annoying- Multiplayer is a copy of counter strike (at least I think it is), they should've made a open world multiplayer instead but I guess that was hard back thenThe game is pretty nice, the cons are not too significant so I would recommend you to buy it.

												While definitely not as good as SoC, i dont think its a waste of time like anyone says.The athmosphere is really really good, just like in the previous one. I find the weapons to be more realistic and better, while the enemies were also a really big challenge. The addition of faction wars is quite nice, and also the new way of finding artifacts and dealing with anomalies. The graphics, while not the best, definitely improved, as well as some in-game aspects like the HUD, the radar etc. Another thing i really really liked was the addition of new areas on the map, which werent there in the previous game-they made this experience feel refreshing. Sad part is there arent some other areas anymore, like Prypiat and Rostok. I'd say the worst part of this game would be the side quests. Those are kinda bad and dont give rewards worth fighting for, tho i do recommend doing some in order to have better equipment (i dont even know how i managed to finish the game with no body armour, no bandages and only a few medkits-i guess i got lucky). Just like SoC, Clear Sky also has strong replayability Overall, I strongly recommend this game to everyone, especially those who played the first one, for it is challenging and fun (SoC is still better though)Stay cheeki breeki			"

												If you are considering to buy Clear Sky, you probably already played either Shadow of Chernobyl or Call of Pripyat and are wondering if arguably the ""worst"" Stalker game is still worth your time. It is still a pretty great game as long as you have enough patience to get out of the swamps and to the Cordon. You see, the developers were trying to implement this whole ""faction war"" game mechanic. It is not too bad, but it's just not Stalker. It is pretty much never touched upon in the the rest of the game. But in the beginning of the game it is pretty much nothing but that. It'll take you about 30 minutes maybe to clear out all the bandits in the swamp. After that, it is pretty much a standard Stalker game. Interesting prequel to Shadow of Chernobyl.Oh, and Freedom is just a bunch of stoners in this Stalker game.			"

												First off, this game is amazing. Factions, war zones, balls to the wall, ect. If you played the ""first"" S.T.A.L.K.E.R. You will greatly appreciate this game. It takes place before the first game, and you definitely should play this game first to better apprecidate Shadow of Chernobyl. The gameplay is greatly improved upon, you can join the different factions, and then take out the enemy factions by capturing locations. Some new areas are opened up, but you also see areas that you have visited, if you played S.O.C, before they were damaged further and taken over by other factions. End of story, GET THIS GAME!5/5. Balls to the wall. Buy it. Now. Do not wait for a sale. Totally worth it.P.S. Get the S.T.A.L.K.E.R Clear Sky complete mod as well. IT'S FREE.			"

												You know, for a Prologue, It is not bad. It could have been better though.The Gameplay, levels, and Characters are still here. They are just worn down slightly. But the difficulty curve goes to the highest level at the beginning, and gets much harder over time. You cannot survive more than a Couple Makarov bullets ripping through your flesh, but all the other enemies can survive so many rounds to the point that you are wasting your own ammo. Money is much harder to make, Medical supplies are impossible to find, but Ammo is so easy to find. The story is slowly paced but very well performed and well written. AI is a mixed bag, Artifacts now require a detector to find, But this and all the other S.T.A.L.K.E.R entries are beautifully designed, immersive, and can be replayed over and over again. I am glad this is $10 less tthan the other two because It is quite weaker actually. But I think this is better than Call of Pripyat. THATS RIGHT.  This game hits more notes than CoP. Might as well play this after you complete SHoC.Overall: 7.9/10			"

												Not the best of the three games, but the most action-packed one for sure. A lot of NPCs and a lot of fights between them, the constant war all over the zone creates a nice background to the usually abandoned irradiated plains of northern Ukraine. The story is a little rushed and does not tie in well, in my opinion, with the rest of the games. It has too much ""voodoo"" supernatural bs to it (not that SoC had that at the end too). A word of warning, the factions cannot be completely destroyed (which kind of takes the whole point out of the faction war), the game is quite short and there is not much to entertain you when the main story arc is finished.However there is one big reason I like this particular S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and it is this video (CLICK THE LINK), which to me is comedy gold.

												Despite this game's quirks and bugs (which are easily fixed by a good mod) it is quickly becoming my favourite game in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. The level of storytelling and lore is unmatched by the other two games in the series. It also gives you a glimpse into the early Zone and the faction war that ravaged it, allowing you to join a faction and bring about victory against your foes. Ignore the universal dislike this game suffers, it is a great game to play through for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. fans and those who've never played any of the series before.			"

												Yes!If you want to experience a little bit more realistic stuff, you need a better computer, which i luckily have.So first, this game is very great, let me tell you why: 1. There are many gun upgrades.2. It takes a good time to earn money,  very realistic stuff.3. You can't farm money and guns and items, its good, teaches you not to waste any stuff you have in your inventory.4. Hard enemies, no matter what difficulty you play (Even the novice level is hard for me, so i dont know what's going on in the expert difficulty, hahaha)5. Good inventory placement, press H (or whatever your inventory bind is, and everything will be in a cozier and nicer way of placement)6. You get to see Chernobyl7. You can actually find many items and guns, super OP.My points ended here.Now about pros:1. Emissions don't occure often.2. Good spray patterns on every weapon + the recoil on some of them.3. Realistic enemy hitboxes + body hits minuses some health depends where you hit the enemy.4. You can walk while interacting with your inventory + you can bind any control you want (The best is medkits and bandages)5. You get alot of support from your stalker group.6. This game is actually worth your time.Cons:1. No co-op on the same map with your friend2. Multiplayer game is broken, everyone almost cheats + there are no real classic mode (survival one)jackpot: I got this game off the ♥♥♥ for 1,64 euro, and i would even pay 5 euros for this game, no more.

												I would recommend any of the stalker games. but this one is hands down the best. you have a faction system to keep you entertained,a sky that actually has some blue in it from time to time in some areas. just a good games. only downside is the graphics look a bit dated but if you can look past the model quality or download a mod to improve them you will have a good time			"

												Hmmm where to start?! first i'll let you know that this review includes some cheeki breeki spoilersI continued my journey with STALKER series & here's a full list of S.T.A.L.K.E.R Clear Sky's pros & cons comparing to Shadow of Chernobyl:Pros:> Improved, better looking UI> Improved visuals, you got sun rays now for example.> Upgradable weapons & armors with many cool futures.> Improved map including new useful markers.> Clear sky combines old maps with new interesting ones.> Artifacts now are extremely rare and could only be found by using a detector, but they're quite profitable and worthy, which make a lot of sense based on S.T.A.L.K.E.R's lore. unlike ShoC where you can find cheap artifacts floating everywhere.> Faction wars: you can join a faction and start a war against the enemy faction by helping your friends to occupy important checkpoints & bases with providing support along the way.Cons (time for real ♥♥♥♥):> Hit detection is broken: it suppose to be somehow ""realistic"" by using real-time bullet mechanics, the main problem is that weapons accuracy is garbage (you aim with the ironsight on something & click the trigger, bullets don't hit the exact point cause ♥♥♥♥ aiming) there're only few weapons that could hit accurately.> Some weapons Upgrades are broken: i used an AK which moves up due to the high recoil, then upgraded it by reducing the recoil, the freakin gun now moves down on shooting.> Try shooting a controller with a shotgun directly on his face, then come back to tell me how many shells it took you to kill him.> Lots of Bugs, i had many CTD across the entire game, the X-Ray engine is not stable & you'll face a lot of problems especially on DX10 settings  > Quicksave, then hit a quickload: you'll see a different weather, whoa magic!!> NPCs have huge ♥♥♥♥ing invisible walls, you'll constantly find yourself in situations where you want to take cover from enemies fire, then some smartass'll come to hide next to you & knock you out!> NPCs can throw grenades right between your legs, protect your balls.> Faction wars system is somehow broken, you may spend long time waiting for your teammates to come & take a point you've already cleaned. what makes it worse that you can't procceed without having the previous point occupied by your faction.> Friendly factions will constantly ask you to lend a hand to defeat some enemy while you're minding your own business.> the Duty leader feels like a marijuana dealer in clear sky (he's the DUTY leader ffs)> The ending part is ♥♥♥♥: Monolith troops spawn right in your face while you're uncovered and the ending scene doesn't make a damn sense (unless if you google it).The last thing i would like to say is that Clear Sky is still a nice game & worth to play if you're a fan of this series, the story is not the best but it introduce you to new mechanics & areas of the zone.Clear Sky doesn't has that ""unique personality"" of Shadow of Chernobyl, the first game feels creepy, cold, sad, interesting & thrilling. This one is easier & warmer.Now get out of here stalker!			"

												Many say this is the worst S.T.A.L.K.E.R game. Well, for the worst game in the franchise, this game is amazingly addicting! First of all, if you enjoy survival games that are not cheap and full of gimmicks (I'm looking at you Dean) then you will most likely enjoy playing this game! Food, water, and radiation are all there to aid and tear you down as you march through The Zone! Encountering wild animals, dangerous humans, and seemingly other-worldly creatures keeps you on your toes at all times even in 2015! This was my first S.T.A.L.K.E.R game and it will NOT be my last!

												Stalker has been considered by many a post-apocalyptic first person shooter game. But it isn't, your in a Cordon zone of the Chernobyl area that has been abandon since April of 1986 due to NPP4 catastrophic failure rendering the environment hazardous to live in. Yes, the place dose exists for real, all locations are based on real locations in the real zone. Life is still going on everyday for the people out side of the zone. The Stalker game series is inspired off the book ""Roadside Picnic"", which is a short science fiction novel written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky in 1971. More information on this book is available on a wiki, and the book is also available in English now.  The game is a open world exploration as well as mission directive, Remember that.Clear Sky has its bugs elements but I like the game and has been fun, I been in the zone here since the first release of the dvd of the 1.0 version.  Here your in the Cordon off Zone in which has become a prison. You can get in, but you can't get out. There is trading with traders, and different factions that may or may not care for you. Many dangerous anomalies to contend with, and artifact to collect and sell for money. Have to watch out for the areas that are radioactive still. One of the things to remember is question everyone and trust no one. Being skeptical with a gut feeling at times is better than a fire fight, When in this game it is important.The annoying draw back in this game is the bug issues, for some reason even a updated version of the game on steam has not cleared bug issues that rolled over from the 1.0 of the game. For this game, mainly if you plan to use a mod, you really need to have at lest 4gigs of ram for the best results. It works on win7 64 bit, but there has been complaints pending Operating systems causing issues with the game. You may want to check in the forums. Due to the buggy issues I normally would not recommend the game, but Others had been able to play the default game and complete it. And the stalker community out of many I have seen is the most helpful there. It seems every stalker dose what they can to help you. And a good community like that is a nice thing to have.  Makes it hard not to recommend the game.  "

Turns out this is awesome, it is keeping me from feeding my  cs:go addiction, no achievments, or multi player but cool story, weapon upgrades, dialogue and enough open world to keep the scripted storyline playable.I have just collected a sniper weapon and am off to kill the bloodsucker ... tanked on vodka10/10			"

												Clear Sky is not as fun as CoP (my favorite) and yet dissapoints fans of SoC. If you already know what CoP and SoC are, then you likely own them AND Clear Sky, so I'm not sure why you're reading this review.For everyone else playing STALKER for the first time in 2016, get Call Of Prypiat. If you don't hate it, go back in time with the original Shadow of Chernobyl, then play Clear Sky.			"

												Personally i believe this is one of the best games ever due to how dynamic the gameplay is. If your into first person or any open world shooter this is the game for you. Not only is clear sky good but they have other games in the series such as shadow of Chernobyl or call of pripyat. The stalker series would of been amazing if they haven't of given up on the stalker 2 game but they did and now the licence was grabbed my bit composer, which is making the game survarium a look alike to the stalker series turned into a first person mmo shooter. Over all of this game i have to give it a 10/10. i don't want to be a graphic's ♥♥♥♥♥ but the game was made a while back so don't expect far cry or skyrim graphics. Now i'm going to go into the dynamics part of the game. The game is very immersive. you can spend around 1-5 hours on this game and get back to the real world like ""What just happened?"" In this game in the series (Clear Sky) you play as a mercenary named scar. you were able to survive a emission which is a blast of radioactive energy that kills anything that is stupid enough to get caught in one. during this game you will encounter mutants, bandits, and anomalies. Mutants have very nice models; The Pseudo dogs for example, they have very nice facial features witch can really be frightening at the night time play through's. The Players in this game don't have the best AI as they might hide behind something that is not as much ""cover"" and they will shout obscenity's at you in Russian as you fight them. This is the only game were i believe the bandits don't kill you on site, unlike on shadow of Chernobyl were they just are marked as enemy.If you buy this game, don't. just save for the bundled pack of the stalker series because during a sale, like the winter sales event you would be able to pick it up for 15 bucks, as did I. The game is GREAT! if you know anyone that is into lore as skryim you can get into the lore in stalker. it may be dark and a bit freaky but it will amaze you in the lifestyles and hardships that they face every day.***** Five stars, Buy this game!oh, it also has a terrible multiplayer.... but who cares right?

												Clear Sky is another fine entry in the STALKER series. Less intense than Shadow of Chernobyl (SOC); less claustrophobic, less scary. But all the incredible atmosphere of this genre-bending series is intact. Impressively, compared to SOC, Clear Sky presents both a more linear main quest, and a more sandboxy world to explore.There are some bugs in this game. The map for the city of Limansk... some people can't load games that are saved on this map, which makes it very difficult to complete the game. Because of the bugs, many people skip this title and move straight to Call of Pripyat.To beat Limansk, I used the ""Wish Granter” feature that is included in the Stalker Complete mods to spawn myself some allies to help me through Limansk without saving. (More on the ""Complete"" mods in the comments below). The STALKER series is one of PC gaming's finest. If you miss the complexity and subtlety that we used to enjoy before consoles got popular, you really should check these games out.			"

												Ukrainian and Russian post-apocalyptic open world RPG/FPS taking place around a fictional second accident at Chernobyl. Like the other S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, mod for best results. Clear Sky is the second game in the series and probably the least favored by the community because of it's bugginess. A strong addition though to the three titles Clear Sky takes players to the Zone before the events of Shadow of Chernobyl. Clear Sky's defining mechanic is faction wars, absent from the other two titles, it also features some new areas and some old but differently inhabited.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: C̶l̶e̶a̶r Grenade Sky is canonically the first of the STALKER series, and also the most difficult entry in some regards. Of particular note is the fact that Bloodsuckers are invincible while invisible(whereas in Shadow of C̶h̶e̶r̶n̶o̶b̶y̶l Grenade they were still a pain to kill, but could be hurt no matter what phase it was in). If Call of P̶r̶i̶p̶y̶a̶t Grenade was the only STALKER you've played, then C̶l̶e̶a̶r Grenade Sky will serve as an unpleasant(or at least unexpected) surprise. For everyone else, you get to experience the mixed feelings that come from obsessively quicksaving before every major action and dying repeatedly to a̶n̶o̶m̶a̶l̶i̶e̶s grenades, r̶a̶d̶i̶a̶t̶i̶o̶n grenades, m̶u̶t̶a̶n̶t̶s grenades, b̶a̶n̶d̶i̶t̶s a noo cheeki breeki iv damke, and p̶s̶y̶c̶h̶i̶c̶ ̶a̶b̶o̶m̶i̶n̶a̶t̶i̶o̶n̶s blowouts. As with all of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, an excellent quasi-survival sim of which a majority of its charm is derived from the unrelenting and completely unforgiving difficulty.For those who want to know what Master difficulty is like, here is a very good example:

												Personal review of: S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear SkyMods: S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky CompleteDifficulty: MasterS.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky is a sequel/prequel to the events prior to Shadow of Chernobyl. Taking place in 2011, where a second emission took place and created the Zone, a place filled with mutants, strange anomalies, and it's populated by STALKERS, basically scavengers/fighters/artifact seekers, you get the point. You play as Scar, a veteran STALKER chasing down Strelok when an emission hits and you are left incapacitated. You wake up at Clear Sky base, a swamp base where this faction is devoted to understanding the Zone and learning all it's secrets and uncovering the strange phenomens going on. After you finish a few tasks you are free to explore the Zone and side with whatever faction you want, explore and play the game. I won't say more than this since it took me 2,5 hours just to leave the Swamp areas (doing quests, exploring etc.), so the rest is up to you to find out. The game is built on the same X-Ray engine, with a few updated changes. Mainly the AI has been tweeked to fit the new faction war system, visuals have been upped, and many more changes have been implemented. As far as Stalker Clear Sky goes, almost all the weapons have been reused for this prequel, half of the areas too meaning you will revisit some familiar places while exploring new ones. Enemies, NPC's too, so you might find the actual content of this one a bit lacking. Onto more relevant changes, the HUD got reworked, being simplified, also the PDA got some new features, being able to track more easily your tasks, you can now see enemy/friendly factions on the radar, giving you a better understading of where they are being concentrated, etc. The hunger system has been removed, don't know why honestly, weapon upgrades are available, the way you collect/obtain artifacts has also been changed, to the point where you need to use an artifact detector to ""see"" them. This also implies you will have to walk into the middle of anomalies and hope you won't get killed before you collect them. Stalker Clear Sky has received some flak, being the ""weakest"" part of the trilogy, and I can see why. This game really kicks you in the balls, same as Shadow of Chernobyl, you start off really underpowered, with little to no ammo/supplies to push through the onslaught of enemies in the Swamp areas. Beware, playing this game and rushing the main storyline will result in a frustratingly hard game. I recommend taking your time and exploring, doing side-quests, parting with different factions as it will result in a much more relaxed experience. It's hard as ♥♥♥♥. There's no doubt about it. But why is it hard? All Stalker games are hard, there's no question about it, this is how these games were built, as an PC exclusive hardcore survival/rpg-ish experience, but S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky comes short in some areas. The thing is the atmosphere, lighting, texture quality is on par and beyond it's first game, but it falls flat in AI behaviour, there are less underground areas to explore (which were a highlight), side tasks include a lot of fetching and killing. These are the most basic things about it. Then we move into combat, wich remains largely unchanged except for one thing. Grenades, I can't stres enough how annoying this addition is, not only will NPC's hit you 90% with them, they will also result in an instant death on higher difficutly levels, which is not very Stalker like. We all know how you can't really take cover in these games, being surrounded by anomalies, high radiation levels and NPC's throwing grenades makes the combat feel unfair at times. Also the fact that they still use the same weapons as you use, only with 100% accuracy and 0 bullet drop is just horse ♥♥♥♥. Seriously. My main gripe with this game is the combat. It feels so random and so luck based that it's the single thing that really kills this game. Don't get me wrong, this is a massive game, with tons of stuf to do, but when it comes to combat (being an FPS game also) it sucks. It just ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. Bullets dance around hitboxes all the time, it feels like when you shoot in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky you play roullete or you roll the dice. It all comes down to what the game wants to hit, not you. Fully upgraded weapons feel the same, so there's no excuse here. Secondly, the last part of the game (Once you reach Limansk) is just A grade bullcrap. This whole area is designed around enemies placed in hard to reach/predict areas, Monolith soldiers are so buffed, I died almost 50 times in the last part of the game alone. Seriously, a fully upgraded suit will only serve to protect you against 2-3 bullets maximum. There are also a lot of engine crashes here and plenty of bugs, so expect to be disappointed near the end of the game. And now, we have to move to the Chernobyl NPP area. SPOILER ALERT Once you reach Chernobly, this is where the game was at it's worst. First off, there are so many enemies at once, it's likely you will die 90% of the time without any chance of shooting back. Why? They never miss, they take 10-15 bullets to get killed. Also you're presured by the fac that you have to hit Strelok with a gun that isn't effective at all against all the Monolith soldiers being spawned  in this area. This last level is probably one of the worst I've ever played. No joke, hitscan enemies everywhere, almost 0 cover and little or no indication to what you're supposed to do or where Strelok is, I'm not asking for a ♥♥♥♥ing bullseye above his head, but seriously the minimap is useless here, and so are the teleporters, serving only to confuse the player. Want to know how ♥♥♥♥ this level is? It took me one hour to finish it, only because I died constantly and 70% of the time I was loading my last save game. When I did finish it, Strelok got stuck in an area off screen, seriously, he was outside Chernobyl and I was able to snipe him only to get the ending which only disappointed me. I played SoC and CoP and those game featured multiple endings, to my delight, here it's just the same 30 seconds cutscene, which I won't discuss for the sake of your own discovery. Anyways, let's cut the crap since this game is from 2008 and I've talked so much already nobody is going to bother reading this anyway, so here is a small list of what works and what doesn't in the 2nd Stalker instalmentThe good:Superb atmosphereAmazing lighting effectsAstounding weather changes + the seamless shifts from day-nightFaction warsWeapon customizationImproved HUD + PDA/Map systemRefined visuals, better draw distance and richer enviromentsHuge sandboxThe bad:Recycled enemies, weapons, enviroments make this Prequel feel like they used cut content/turned a boxed expansion pack into a standalone titleHorrible gun mechanics, play it for yourself I can't explain it (note: I didn't play the vanilla version, I can't imagine how bad the guns perform in the base game)The beginning and ending of this game are atrocious. HonestlyFewer underground areas, which were a highlight of this seriesThey removed the hunger system, the stamina system sucks in this, making it feel less survival compared to SoC and CoPLack of impact on the overall arch of the story, no matter what faction you chose, it all boils down to what gear you obtain, rendering the whole ""choice"" of it all utterly useless.Less russian dialogue and voiced lines, rendering the immersion to a bare minimum in this title.Little to non-existent expansion on the Stalker universe&lore.In the end, I can only recommend S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky only with Mods, I've tried it with Complete only, but I still recommend it, there are few games that come close to it. A personal rating of 7/10.			"

												I initially played the second STALKER game exclusively in Russian. I had the Ukranian collector's edition. I don't speak and can barely read cyrlic. But i beat the game. Does this say something negative? Probably, the story wasn't anything too interesting, feeling like a creation from a decision basedo on the success of ShoC.The grenade bugs are frustrating, the endgame pales in comparison to ShoC, but the improved graphics and envrionmental story telling are incredible. Limansk is one of the most involving settings to any video game, and that cut content teleroom gives me the creeps.Faction Wars is probably the best idea to happen to the series although its implementation is so-so. IT feels great rising through the imposed ranks, it doesn't feel good being told to help all these small patrols who seem to be attacked 24/7 and watching them die from kilometers away feels like forced drama.8/10			"

												In the second installation of the wonderful S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise you play a mercenary named Scar. Clear Sky takes place one year prior to the events in the first game. In this prequel, you not only learn about Strelok's past, but you also discover that before settling in The Zone, all of your enemies were participants in the NFL. Becoming quite nostalgic about their past in the world of sports, these said individuals recreate their days on the football field with live grenades.			"

												While the weakest game in the line up it is still loads of fun and maintains much of the bleak and beautiful atmosphere of the other games.  The glitches are more noticable and don't blend in as well with rest of the environment like in the first game, but on the whole none of them are game ruining.  Ultimately all of the issues can be smoothed out with community mods, that are abundant to say the least, and can be found in the forums and support pages.  If you are new to the series I don't recomend starting with this game, but it is a must for those who know and enjoyed one of the other two.8/10  re-defined bolt throwing.

												In Stalker: Clear Sky, you learn of an ill-fated faction of scientists trying to actually figure out The Zone's secrets. A lot of people overlook this game and only play the 1st and 3rd games in this series, but I still think it has a lot to offer. Also- one of the best endings of any game I've ever played.			"

												Universally considered the ""worst"" STALKER game out of the three, it is not necessarily a bad game. In short, if you like any other STALKER game you should give this a playthrough.This game lacks the bleakness and some of the atmosphere found mainly in Shadow of Chernobyl but also Call of Pripyat. The Zone is very populated by NPCs compared to other STALKER games which very much contributes to the fact that the environment feels less hostile. Compared to the 4 horror centric underground areas of SHoC, Clear Sky only has one that is less frightening compared to the SHoC counterparts. Compared to unmodded SHoC, Clear Sky is in many ways a bit more polished in terms of better animation quality, graphical effects and user interface. Clear Sky also introduces a much welcomed weapon upgrade/repair system that was absent from SHoC.While I generally think that the first time you play a STALKER game it should be unmodded I would say that I make an exception for Clear Sky. Clear Sky unmodded has some issues that are flat out annoying and I would consider it bare minimum to install the Sky Reclamation Project (latest version as of 2015-06-30 is 1.0.4) to fix most of those issues. SRP is still pretty close to a vanilla experience and is provided mainly to fix various bugs.I would also like to mention the following mods that doesn't impact gameplay but makes it look a bit better.Atmosfear 1.3 - Improves weather effects, improves game atmosphere (This is also available for Call of Pripyat)Absolute Nature/Structures - High resolution texture mods that makes things look a bit more crisp (This is also available for Shadow of Chernobyl and Call of Pripyat)			"

												It's buggy, and lag spikes are often an issue. Overall when you break the game down to it's mechanics, how it runs, then I don't recommend this game. However, the atmosphere you're set in is equal to any other STALKER games out there. Essentially it's as good when it comes to the story, setting, characters etc. If you can deal with some annoying preformance issues, which I'm sure are fixable it's just that I haven't got around to fixing them yet, then yea this is a good game. In addition, if you played the other two stalker games and you've began to miss the Zone, get this. even though it's not perfect, it's still Stalker, and the Zone is still that unforgiving nuclear wasteland that you've been craving for so long.

												After reading some reviews of this online and hearing about the many bugs CS has i bought it anyway and i am glad about my purchase, so here is a review of one of my favorite survival games.Gameplay- Now when i started i didn't know the controls and i didn't even know i had a headlamp on my first playthrough (This ♥♥♥♥ed me over at night, try navigating with nothing but the glow of your ECHO locator.) and i do wish they had a little tutorial like Shadow of chernobyl had because there we're times where they told me things and i didn't even know what the item was or how to equipt it like the bolt. I had heard about a ton of bugs in the game but i didn't encounter them i think the only bug i had was later in the game i was about to go to CPP and i had to go do some small quests first, well a emission hit and i got stuck and kept dying so what i did was i used my sleeping bag i got from the mod i had (CS Complete) and i slept through it, afterwards every trigger was broken and i had to reload my save to get enemys to spawn or triggers to work and such.Graphics- A lot of people will say the graphics are ♥♥♥♥ and aren't very shiney and new, well i feel that actually adds to the game because while playing newer games like Payday 2 some of the graphics would cause problems with aiming or trying to see a target, while in this i don't have those fancy lens flares or whatever getting in my way while trying to shoot a enemy from far away,Story- The story is kind of ♥♥♥♥, i love it and all but i just can't get into it, it is hard to follow sometimes and some missions just have these massive walls of text, don't get me wrong i love games that have a good story and such but it is like mass effect it has so much text that it just kind of slows the game down and makes me want to take a nap and stop playing. Now i don't want to spoil it so i won't really speak about the mission or the ending but i will tell you that you want to stock up before going through red forest because there are a lot of high paying missions in there that you don't want to fail.Well if you read through my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review that i probably ♥♥♥♥ed up in many parts congrats now you get to see some numbers!I give S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear sky a 8.1/10 great game but some things just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off and didn't make me enjoy the game as much.			"

												Oh where do I begin with Clear Sky? For some reason a lot of game journalists hated on this follow-up title, I'm not sure if they expected a more fully fledged sequel, but that doesn't make sense when you look at games like Crysis Warhead which, while improving on the original game in terms of playability, sort of trimmed up the narrative elements for I don't know brevity's sake I suppose. I mean look IGN gave it a full .9 game review units lower than Shadow of Chernobyl. I take that to mean that the game reviewer spent 9% less time playing it? That was a terrible joke.I have started Clear Sky and yes I'm using the COMPLETE modpack that sort of patches the game up more or less, and yes it does seem less buggy than I remember from playing it a few years ago. It's also much more visually impressive; you've got to hand it to GSC they really do work hard on making the game both functionally a living-breathing world, but also a visually impressive and at times terrifying visual spectacle. The story throws you right into the world of ""The Zone"" much like its predecessor, but unlike its predecessor your character's motivations are much more established in the opening scenes. With the first game it's more of a mystery of your identity that you have to solve (despite the game not ever explicity stating that your identity is unknown to your character). Clear Sky puts you right in the muddy worn-out boots of a STALKER who, while escorting a group of scientists, gets inocculated and then rescued from an event that for some unknown reason, you survived. So there is a mystery of yourself that you have to navigate the world to solve, but it's much less dramatic and much more modest, but that modesty grants you an awesome amount of freedom in the game-world.In Clear Sky, because you're not ""The Marked One,"" your main questline doesn't feel so out of congruence with your doing side quests. For me it always felt weird to deviate from the main questline in Shadow because it felt out of character given the circumstance thrown upon ""The marked one."" The writing and acting from the NPCs reinforces this weird illusion that despite your in-game days of deviating from what should be an imminent threat, they resume helping as if nothing is wrong. I know there's a certain suspension of disbelief you have to engage it, but it's always nice to see developers navigate around these consequnces through the use of clever narrative devices. Clear Sky presents you with a traditional figure-out-the-game set of quests that do override the open world, but once you finish them (which takes less than two hours) you're free to roam and really do anything you want--including working with and eventually joining factions.I'm done talking about this game for now because I want to play it. I'm not done beating it (again) and will finish my thoughts once I've dumped a few more hours into it.Yes I think it's better than Shadow of Chernobyl.ADDENDUM: Actually it is worse than Shadow of Chernobyl. I have decided this based on my last few hours playing and (sort of) beating the game. It just really loses a lot of steam, and the flaws inherent in the combat mechanics render the final quest line push nearly impossible to play. For one thing, the faction war, while intriguing, is really funky. Sometimes your squads never show up to reinforce your position, making your faction's advance toward the enemy base totally stalled--meaning you can't actually beat this portion of the game. There really isn't any good incentive to do this anyway, but completionists will have their knickers in a twist upon realizing that sometimes the faction-war system just breaks. This is big problem with the game. Combat mechanics are similar to SoC, but enemies will have no trouble noticing and then shooting your face from 100 yards off within a matter of like 3 seconds. It is too difficult, and also highly inconsistent with how the combat appears. Sometimes you'll crouch and hunch behind a piece of cover, completely obscuring your view of the enemy shooter, only to have him still shoot you through a tiny gap in the cover, or what I can only assume is a small visible portion of your head that they can see. This makes the game infuriating at times. The ending is so thrown together and terrible, that I'm surprised I was able to complete it without totally cheating. I mean at one part you have to fight through like 25 Monolith stalkers by yourself, your squad leaving you behind for no apparent reason either. I just used the wish granter and spawned a few friendlies to make that encounter not totally terrible. It was still a challenge just not a stupid hard one.It's cool chasing and fighting Strelok at the end, and the implications of the ending are spelled out in the original title. therefore the game lacks any alternate endings, as well as any real tangible consequences with respect to the faction-war. The narrative comes off as dry and very one-tracked, and you're just waiting for it to finish so you can install Call of Pripyat and have a good time.The game's world is awesome though, and to its credit it does improve on quite a lot that SoC lacks. Finding anomalies is much more of a challenge, as you have to navigate dangerous obstacles produced by the anomaly, relying on your trusty bolt, scanner, and anti-rad drugs. Weapon customization is really worth it in this game, and decking out an AK that shoots super fast and has no recoil is always a good move. Clear Sky is such a mixed bag, because there is so much wrong with it, despite it's solid roots in the fantastic original, and it's smart improvements on that formula. It's buggy and many of the level design and AI encounters feel really ♥♥♥♥y. If you're looking to get into stalker, I wouldn't feel bad telling you to just skip this one unless you're really curious. Call of Pripyat is just so much better, and feels like a polished complete title. This feels like a really elaborate mod for the original game that never quite made it to a stable release.			"

												I found Clear Sky more enjoyable than Shadow of Chernobyl myself. It's much more refined than SoC and when I moved it was a big breath of fresh air and looking back made SoC seem a bit more flawed than it was on the first play. Clear Sky was one of the first RPG orientated games I was able to complete, but looking back the startup was a bit rough. I can really compliment the sense of progression and direction of the game, as well as being a decent length and engaging enough to play the game til the end. It's not one of the best games i've played but definitely worth the purchase if the price drops down. Just promise yourself to play it, it's a more than decent game.I also felt a lot less ripped off by the ending compared to SoC's true ending.			"

												The prequel of the game STALKER Shadow of Chernobyl.   The user starts as a mercenary named Scar who was found by the Clear Sky faction in The Swamps,unconscious ,after the most powerful emission The Zone ever did, near the bodies of some scientists that he was paid to lead. The character is a mercenary but is not part of the faction ""Mercenaries"" and he was able to survive 2 emissions that affected his nervous system ( this leads to blurry moments during gameplay).The story takes place in The Zone and your task whether you like it or not is to help the Clear Sky faction find out who is messing with The Zone until The Zone turns every living beeing into ashes.   Clear Sky brings new dangerous areas with new quests, a new anomaly called ""Space Anomaly"", taxi, improvements to the graphics ( like dx10,sun shafts etc ) and gameplay.The user is now able to repair and modify equipment (guns and suits) with the help of data found on usb sticks ( the mechanics will ask for these for advanced changes) and join factions after helping them defeat their rivals but beware you are neutral to all {except monolith and some mercenaries} and taking part in their wars will set your status ""at war"" with the faction they're at war. Artefacts aren't spread all over the map like in SoC and since they're produced by anomalies they can be found only in anomalies,invisible to the naked eye but visible with the help of detectors. Almost every settlement has a taxi that can lead you in places ( not everywhere) if you pay him.  The game opens the path for Stalker Shadow Of Chernobyl but doesn't give new info on The Zone. Personally I recommend playing this as vanilla for a true STALKER experience then you can mod it and enjoy unexplored areas.Pros-Work for artefacs ,money and everything else.-Awesome game-Taxi for fast travel-More than one entry in some areasCons-Game has a good chance to crash at the Deserted Hospital, the Red Forest and Limansk resulting in corrupt saves (saves are lost)-Cheap Swamp quests-No direction whatsoever for quests from mechanics etc.For a true STALKER there are no cons.Good hunting Stalker.

												I tend to think of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R games as Marmite games. People either can't stand it or they get addicted. Sure each and every stalker game has it's bugs. The gritty way the games play is brilliant though. It's an odd difficulty curve, starting off quite hard, getting easier and easier as you get better gear. That's probably the main thing that puts people off, it's a trial by fire. Make it to the point you start getting some nice gear and your all set.

												I havent played the other Stalker game so I cant compare but for the first time playing this series it has been brillant.Played solid for 4 hours straight without getting bored, for a game which is relevantly old has the foundation for a lot of modern games that comming out with a lot of interaction with Ai and being open world. I brought this game on sale for around £3.00 so for me was well worth it not sure if I would pay £15 for the game but so far enoying the game a lot. And if people comment saying dont understand why there dyeing after using medic and bandages etc it is probably radiation poisoning  which can be reduced using vodka or the chemical medic item that forgotten the name of.

												Sim, Clear Sky beira o 'ruim' e o 'não tão bom quanto o SoC mas bom'. O jogo começa bem, open world como o primeiro, te dando opções pra completar as missões, escolha de facções pra uma faction war q parece interessante. Depois começa a frustração. O jogo se afunila e fica linear como um Call of Duty, matando qualquer tipo de exploração e uma ♥♥♥♥♥da de situações scriptadas. O faction war não funciona: você limpa e captura pontos, mas seus aliados não ocupam o local, e qdo vc sai os inimigos simplesmente voltam. Você então desiste do Faction War e foca na story line. Mesmo na dificuldade Normal, os inimigos conseguem te acertar mesmo q você esteja sem 1% do corpo a mostra - atras de cobertura. Conseguem dar tiros certeiros q tiram metade da sua vida. Pra piorar, sua armadura tem durabilidade e a única forma de consertar é com NPCs, e custa caro e nem sempre você tem acesso a eles, principalmente da metade pra frente do jogo, qdo vira um rollerscoaster. A última fase então é um ♥♥♥♥ fest: tem ""tempo limite"", inimigos q teleportam na sua frente e atras de você, com screenshake atrapalhando sua mira, e você tendo q correr contra o tempo.Como eu disse, o jogo começa bem e termina horrivel. Ele parece ser superior ao SoC por melhorar algumas coisas, como gunplay e facções q realmente fazem a diferença, mas nope, é tudo muito raso. Os gráficos e a ambientação são lindos. Mas é isso. Vale a pena se você tiver muita paciencia, curtir a série e visitar a Zona um pouco diferente.			"

												clear sky is the second part of stalker games, taking place around same time as first one, but from different perspective. from my opinion its best to play shadow of chernobyl first, since it makes sense to all little things in this game. i have this game as a non-steam cd and digital steam version (shared by friend) and while the base game is awesome, i recommend you buy it from a store. steam version is more laggy and unstable (idk why) but i think the non-steam works better.

												Essential things to make the game playable:-Accuracy mod: remove RNG accuracy.-Antialiasing on DX10 and above set to 2x or downsample on your own; use SGSSAA on DX9 or an injection--SMAA (SweetFX) forces the game to DX9. So use eFX if you want DX10.-God rays mod: it makes the game look awesome (and it didn't affect performance in my case). Also, don't install Shaders max mod; it has a lot of compatiblity issues and it affects the performance negatively instead (as the mod author states that it affected half of the users).Warning: I somehow like the game, but I am on the negative side. I am done with it at this point. I do enjoy obsecure games with meh gameplay, provided that they have other redeeming qualities, but gunplay in this game is simply bad.Pros: -Good atmosphere.-Nice graphics.-Great gameplay/survival elements.-Factions and collecting artifacts.Cons:-Extremely bad gameplay.-Badly optimized.-Hypersensitive when it comes to modding.Summary: Don't waste your time with this outdated, dysfunctional piece of crap. If you want to play it, install mods BEFOREHAND and WASTE a large amount of time. I really liked it at first and liked its aesthetics; I am simply disgusted at the fact that I wasted over 5 hours trying to get the damn game to work after installing a couple of mods, and trying to deal with the shooting mechanics. I am 10+ hours into the game and I will not restart just to install a mod that is essential to play the weakest entry in the series.I will start with the most important thing in  video games: gameplay and how functional it is. Clear Sky is not only the weakest entry in the series (supposedly lacking in atmosphere but it is my first Stalker game), but it is utterly unplayable (once you start fighting things and shotguns miss at point blank range) and makes you wonder if the developers/game designers have been exposed to an excessive amount of radiation to even THINK of such game mechanics--the stupid RNG accuracy.First and foremost, shots are based on RNG, which means you will miss 30ft shots and have to waste a magazine at least to land a SHOT; enemies have a huge amount of HP and they have absurd accuracy and aggro mechanics. I am obviously talking about the hardest difficulty in the game, but shooting is dysfunctional either way; the game is simply boring on lower difficulties. Also weapon jamming (RNGesus), bad maps/no cover when you attack a base, stealth doesn't work properly, FRIGGIN SWAY THAT LASTS HALF A SECOND WHEN YOU MOVE AND AIM, slow aim, slow weapon switching, slow reload...etc. The combat is ****.  With that said, you HAVE to install mods in order to have fun on normal difficulties or something functional on the highest difficulties, which brings us to how crappy is the game when it comes to modding. You will spend hours just troubleshooting and figuring out in the end that there is some shader incompatibilty or some crappy dll file missing. And the worst of all is having to restart a new game when you install an overhaul or other types of mods. Another point is the optimization and lack of a proper Antialiasing. The latter completely destroys the performance when you max out the game on DX10.1. I ended up with a much better game that runs on high frame rate and looks good with godrays  mod, but jaggies and transparent object edges are there; 2x is the most subtle option. Trying to use SMAA or FXAA injections means you have to use DX9, so good luck making a decision there. The good point is that the game does feel and look atmospheric, but the combat is an utter piece of crap. The best course of action is to play CoP or SoC (if you can bear with wasting time trying to mod that crap).			"

												I found this game boring.  It lacked the authentic feel of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game, and honestly felt like a collection of mods than a cohesive game.  The things I disliked about it:- Waiting bugs.  After capturing a location, the assignment of ""Defend and Wait for Reinforcements"" could take up to 30 minutes.  No way to advance the main campaign at that point.- Generic missions, of type ""Go there and retrieve something.""  I lost track of what I was retrieving, and for whom, especially since the sought item was usually in the clear with no one guarding it.  These were also part of the main campaign.- It's boring to accumulate money.  My armor wore out quickly, and I ended up spending a lot of money to patch it.  There were always scores of guns lying around, but with the limited weight capacity, I ended up running back and forth to sell all of them, just to get my armor back to 100%.  Made the game feel tedious.Ultimately, I ended up reading the walkthrough rather than watching/playing the rest of the game, because I lost almost all interest in it.			"

												Very similar to STALKER ShoC (Shadow of Chernobyl). The only differences I can notice (besides internal game mechanics here and there) is that the Clear Sky is a bit bigger from what I've noticed and that this game is longer than ShoC. I have not beat ShoC but in the time I got to say the city that was located at 75% story in Clear Sky, it took me a much shorter time to reach in ShoC. I dont know if there is a magestic throw back in ShoC like the one in Clear Sky that scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me but other than that Clear Sky is great! I use this game to break my friends into stalker because in my opinion the others are harder, and have better mods. This game is open world, has grid like inventory where say a pistol takes a 1x3 slot and an ak takes say a 2x5 slot and you also have to watch weight encumbrance. There is a nice balance between scavenging, dodging anomalies, hiding from  blowouts, and fighting. I would say that the AI get a debuff here, and a buff there. Sometimes the AI no scopes you, sometimes they miss by a bit (which is good!). I hate how the AI scoots you out of the way. Nothing game breaking was spotted, just bugs here and there. This is most definately bolt-throwing simulator 2014 and auto-saving simulator 2014. Why 2014? I wrote this in 2014.I recommend it, worth full price but I always get games on sale:)			"

												The lowest quality of all of the stalkers. The game is clearly influenced heavily by call of duty, which was released just before this. The vanilla game crashes a lot, enemies are quite powerful and grenade spam is common. Bugs are extremely common, and the level design is quite poor.Some of the freedom of approach is deliberately limited for no reason. For example, in one instance a machine gunner is immune to bullets until you can get behind him and shoot him, even if you have a sniper rifle and can already hit him in the head.Most of the changes to gameplay are negative, and you will be spending most of the time desperately managing your bleeding.However, it does add a lot more to the story than call of pripyat.

												The second installment in the franchise, this is actually a prequel to the original. It was heavily criticized for excessive recycling of maps from the first game, but it makes excellent and different use of them while also adding a lot of new areas. This episode features an earlier version of the weapon upgrade system and item repair and has an elaborate faction system where the player can get involced with, and gain varfied rewards from, struggles between opposing groups.Out of the three game I think this is the best. It has most of the refinemenrts not found in the original while keeping the steady power progression and detail not found in the last chapter.			"

I could ramble on for days about this game series, a series that I played while it was still bugged and broken, way before it was reviewed by idiots like IGN, and way before it had hopes of staying mentioned, and of course before it was on Steam. Even with how buggy it was, the series gets a solid 9/10 with gameplay, fun factor, atmostphere of 10/10! I bought the series again on Steam, just to have them closer to me even though I have physical copies of them sitting on my desk right now!			"

I ended up waiting until I was done with CoP before doing it and really there isn't much more to be said about CS or CoP that I didn't say in my SoC review.  These games are fantastic.I've never played more atmospheric games than this series.  The story-telling is also similarly great.  CS takes you back before SoC and gives you a TON of backstory on why and how the events in SoC came to be.  GSC didn't change much of the gameplay elements for CS, which was genius because why ruin a good thing?The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games are all great and should be experienced together.  They are great on their own but so much better when you've played them all.			"

												I finished this game a while back and thought a while about how I'd write my review of it.  I ended up waiting until I was done with CoP before doing it and really there isn't much more to be said about CS or CoP that I didn't say in my SoC review.  These games are fantastic.I've never played more atmospheric games than this series.  The story-telling is also similarly great.  CS takes you back before SoC and gives you a TON of backstory on why and how the events in SoC came to be.  GSC didn't change much of the gameplay elements for CS, which was genius because why ruin a good thing?The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games are all great and should be experienced together.  They are great on their own but so much better when you've played them all.			"

												Second Stalker was improved compared with first under many aspects, everything seems to works very well here and much better, but you'll face again an high difficulty, altough a bit lower compared with the first chapter (and this is a positive note for me).Now, you CAN repair your gears, weapons and armors, this was much more than a simple change, this was awesome, believe me :)Altough in the first game thre was the chance to upgrade some gears, in this game this feature is taken to high levels, allowing you to improve a lot your armaments, making you almost invincible, money and schematics allowing, yes, because you'll have first find the proper schematic and take them to the right technician who will be able then to upgrade your stuff....I said above you ned a lot of money to upgrade your gears, so farming money will be very important in this game and will recquire a lot of time and here comes a very negative aspect of this game, because there will be a point in the game, where you'll lose all your money, and no, there is nothing you can do to avoid it, it's part of main story, so my suggestion id to store all your found gears in a stash and sell to vendors only AFTER this disgraceful event will happens.I really hated this feature invented by devs cause there is nothing that advice you before, i spent hours farming and lost all, lucikly a previous savegame fixed in part the problem but made me losea lot of time and patience...And again, another very bad new feature in this game will be the EMISSIONS, a sort of radiation explosion that will happens suddenly while you'll play, no matter where you are and what are you doing (and how much heavy you'll be in that moment, so you'll not be able to run :(  ) so to avoid to be instant killed you'll have to take cover, but, you think that will be enough enter in ahoude or inside a solid tunnel ? Nope, you''ll have to run in specific marked in the map zones (yellow color) where you'll be immune, even if is a n open place, no matter, you'll survive, while you'll die in any other place....So, this could have been a nice feature, if was implemented a little better, but when this random event will happens, you'll be often, ( specially the first time, when you'll die a dozen of times before you'll realize what is happening to you ^^) too damn much far away from the suggested cover point and could happens that you'll not do in time to reeach the safe spot, or because you carry too much stuff that will deny you to run or because in the cover point there are enemies that will kill you while you try to enter, so, with time, you'll learn few tricks that will save your life but, overall, this is very very annoying mini event :(A nice tip, since to make money you'll have to sell weapons dropped by dead soldiers, you'll most of the time be unable to carry more than a few of them cause of the weight limit, making the process difficult cause of the distance to the vendors, i've discovered this after i was already playing and i was very happy of that, dead bodies, of both soldiers and mutants, can be dragged keeping pushed together your USE button + Left SHIFT, this way you can use the corpses like a bag where you can put anyhing you want , altough dragging these corpses for miles could be tricky cause they will fall down from your hands often in the process, you'll have some benefit from this.A new feature of this game is the Factions War, you'll be free if to help some of them and exterminate another or remain neutral with all, you'll receive some serious benefits (in gears) if you'll decide to join some of them, specially The Duty and The Freedom.The search of manufacts, items that will improve some of your stas, incresed of importance here and became a little more funny and pleasant the system to find them.In conclusion, i could recommend this game even to non hardcore players, but the difficulty remain at high levels altough more reasonable compared with the first game.My Final Score is 74 /100  "

												Second game brings us another stories from the Zone this time before the events of the 1st game. Although this Prequel gives us some new Features and stuff it's said that this is the weakest Episode of Stalker's Trillogy.Not happily made Faction wars where you fight and help your Factions holding over specific posts.. all good except you can't actually Defeat the enemy Faction. It will always randomly spawn somewhere and start coming to get the posts back.Followed by bad Engine optimalization and buggy Graphics for ATI cards even when it has ATI logoscreen in the beginning.Big pros goes for Upgrading, Customizing and Repairing your Weapons and Armor + The game is definitely less buggy (Much much less).The story is not that strong and quite predictable.Even with all of this it might be called a great game and I really enjoyed it.PS: ShhHhh denton X)			"

												Due to some flooding and my terrible internet, I ended up playing this game in offline mode. It's an okay game, but a decent entry into the series. This game is a prequel to Shadow of Cernobyl. Clear Sky contains the entirety of Shadow of Chernobyl's map, with two new zones included; however, this makes playing the game seem like more of an expansion than a standalone title. Clear Sky lacks the pacing that was present in the first title. Within 10 minutes you're loaded up with a pistol, assault rifle, ammo, and medkits. Compared to Shadow of Chernobyl, this game is a lot more action oriented. I finished the campaign with about 650 Stalker/Military/Faction kills, and 100 mutant kills. With so many kills, the gameplay began to feel a bit stale. My favorite part about Clear Sky was seeing how my actions affected the future game. I recommend playing Shadow of Chernobyl first, and following up with this game for the backstory. Overall, I would suggest you skip this title unless you are a big fan of the series; although, I highly recommend the first game.			"

												Just like our first title in the series, this takes you BACK to the zone once again but from a diffrent perspective of sorts. This is a prequel to S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl story wise but is changed and upgraded gameplay wise. Instead of being ""The Marked One"" you are now a mercenary named Scar, who is on his mission to chase down and find Strelok. SOUND the same as something before?? You would be right! With a whole new type of battle/gameplay mechanics added in this game might seem to be a challenge to people who have played Shadow of Chernobyl, adapting to the new gameplay style, or for people who are starting the series with this one! Clear Sky for sure packs a punch right back at you from the beginning and I think it is a great game to provide the backstory behind everything to get you ready for the third installment of the game! Totally recommend the normal (Stalker) difficulty for the first run of the game especially if your new to the series and if you are coming here from SoC don't worry.....The pieces all add up soon :) 100% recommend to buy this game to continue the series!

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky is a direct prequel to Shadow of Chernobyl and it's events shed some more light on what went on before SoC and why stuff happened the way it happened. The Zone is also way less of a hostile place in terms of enviorments. The early areas even seem like a cool place to hang out for any man, and the weather is simply splendid from time to time.The fact that this game takes place before SoC also means some gameplay-wise changes. For example; the artifacts the Stalkers are after are way less common. This means that you'll actually have to hunt for them now, making you actually feel like you're doing what SoC told you Stalkers do: they *hunt* for artifacts. The artifacts themselves also have been redone in terms of bonuses they provide. I actually found myself selling them for quick cash in SoC all the time, while in Clear Sky they are actually useful to keep on your person for their bonuses. Some absorb radiation, others provide bonuses to healing regeneration over time. But this is not the only gameplay change, far from it. Due to the massive Zone-Emission at the start of the game, the clans of people in the Zone have gone at war with each other, using the confusion of the Emission as a good reason to take over new territory. Each of these factions are joinable by the player, and come with terrain the faction wishes to defend or capture. For the player this means they can engage (when they want) in capture or defense missions of certain locations, often bringing them rewards, and greater rewards for capturing bases. As they do this, the influence of their faction increases, while that of the enemy faction decreases.Another change is found in AI behaviour, which is (especially on Master) a lot trickier than in SoC. No more wall hugging enemies that are easy to pick off with a sniper rifle. No more ♥♥♥♥♥ that will run into your gun; people are actually clever now. If they try to sneak up on you and you spot them, they'll take off and find cover, to shoot you in formation. Other than these changes, there's numerous other small tweaks and changes, ranging from stalkers that will take you to specific places in the Zone (for a price of course) to the ability to upgrade and maintain weapons and armor, and then I haven't even mentioned the whole -BLOWOUT SOON FELLOW STALKER- part.Then there's locations to visit. Clear Sky mostly borrows it's locations from SoC, even letting the player visit them in the same order SoC made them visit them in. However, some new areas have been added, some old areas removed and some areas have been changed slightly, or have been added more locations to than in SoC. Still, it's mostly the same ♥♥♥♥ you've been through before. This isn't a bad thing per say! After all, the Zone is the Zone and they try to base it on the real Exclusion-Zone in Ukrain, so they did a good job at how they did it.The thing mostly changed about locations that were re-used, is by filling them up with bases of the factions. For example, the Duty faction has it's base at the Agroprom Research Institute, while that was an abandoned bunch of offices in SoC. They actually made proper use of such empty locations this time around, and that was fun.However, the endgame is absolutely horrible. The last hour is filled with bugged AI, terrible game design and is just horrificly stupid. The game decides it's a good idea for you to shoot a running target over a long walkway. This walkway is interrupted by several teleports which teleport you to locations where you have to finish off certain enemies only to progress to the next teleport. Not only is this insanely out of place, it's also badly programmed and build in at the most unlogical time possibe. A massive downside.Overall I'm giving this one an 8/10			"

												Awesome game! I have installed ""Complete mod"" and the landscapes are just brilliant. I was playing a lot Fallout series and comparing to it, Stalker is REAL survivor game - in this game you can't even jump few times in a row, you need to get rest a bit. Duels with enemies are so real that you need to think twice when you attack someone - it's not just about pointing gun at someone and firing, it's very close to real situations. First few times it was hard to adapt to Stalker (as normally I would expect the game to be easy at beginning and then go tricky as you go - but not with Stalker!), as it was particularly harder than Fallout, however after initial learning curve you just can't stop playing it! Definitelly recommended to anyone who likes first-person survial and shooting games.			"

It's combat style made me get the feeling I get when fighting in DayZ with full gear and it really gets your heart going or so atleast it did mine.Gun-Play: 8Graphics: 5Story: 6Over all quality: 9			"

												In this game you play as a soldier called Lee Shepard and you decided one day that to prevent your grandma's death you shall stalk her for the rest of her life. But after she dies you go in a quest to stalk the person who killed her. After the person  dies of old age you start to teabag his body and get into heaven to stalk God. Then the game ends there. The end. Sorry for the spoilers. You can still stalk for yourself and see what they were doing though.P.S this doesn't reflect the game at all. :)			"

												You know one of those games that might seem like a knock off but does a good job? This is one of those games. I've spent over 75 hours in the game and I am about to go throguh another run at it again soon and boy oh boy, I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. It's rough around the edges in difficulty and smooth in story, a nice touch to the game itself since most of them now a days are either microtransactions or lacking content.Overall punch-line: Think of Fallout, now add Metro and picture a baby - this is that baby / this is that bread for your PP&J / This is that couch that always eats your change, only finding that change when you really need it / this is like that one really good drink you ordered at the bar and forgot what it was called but rediscover it two years later and call it sex in a glass / This is a damn good game in other words.

Death by a thousand tiny cutsThis is by far the WORST game in the series. The bugs are unrelenting, and the enemy can effortlessly hit you from any distance with any weapon. When I first started playing this, I thought the factions fighting each other, and the people constantly following objectives was really cool, but as you go through the main story and do more quests, you realize just how braindead the AI is, how many ♥♥♥♥ing bugs there are, and how unfair (in a very, very bad way) this game is. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is one of my favorite series, but my god this game is a chore to play. All the little things start to really add up as you play through this game. I can usually deal with bugs, but this game is… far beyond repair. Even with ZRP installed, it is just a complete mess. THough it pains me to say it, avoid this one. The more you play it, the worse it gets. This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing disgrace to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series.			"

												-""Cheeki Breeki Simulator 2007""I'll start this off by saying that i've played the other games (SoC & CoP), which were brilliant post-apocalyptic RPG games, and while ClearSky may have much of the greatness of the other two games, it does seem to be the least brilliant of the three. I havent played enough to talk about this story-wise yet, but gameplay? Well, it isnt much different than the other two games and i'll even admit the NPCs in ClearSky came off pretty smart compared to the other two games. Thats about it. Rest of the gameplay is either up to par or slightly lacking. CoP had more beautiful enviroments, and SoC was generally more dramatic.This being said, ClearSky is the least awesome but still pretty awesome. I highly recomend this game, as well as the other two. Now, I would've given SoC a 9.5/10 and CoP would get a 9.6/10 but I think i'd have to give ClearSky an 8.3/10. It is a great game, just not as great as the other games in the series.			"

												I'll just say this up front: this game is not as good at Shadow of Chernobyl and Call of Pripyat. Not by a long shot: bullet sponge stalkers, buggy AI, generally linear storyline and map progression, lack of decent side quests, and wasted potential of the ""Faction War"" that is more of an exercise in patience than anything else. That said, Clear Sky is still a pretty good game, and for all its faults has a special place in my heart - even if I'm not entirely sure why. While the early patches ""had more bugs than a crack ♥♥♥♥♥ with the sniffles"" I've yet to crash with the steam version. Storyline could be better but is a good enough addition/prequel to the STALKER lore, and for all the frustration and unsatisfaction that will come the overall gameplay is still enjoyable. Plus GSC introduced or overhauled several things in this game that they went on to refine in CoP - weapon modifying, teams of stalkers, fast travel, anomaly fields, artifacts, faction relations, etc - so some stuff being rough around the edges is excusable. And who could forget the bandit polka!If you're a fan of the series, bought the SHoC/CoP bundle but still want more, or just are the style to play through games in order, it's worth the $10 to pick up, especially since the modding scene for it seems to be picking up these days. Give it a try, you won't regret it! Or at least, not till you try to make it past the army MG emplacement...			"

												7/10Overview: First Person ShooterNote: I used the complete mod to play the game. The Good:+ Once again atmosphere is the main selling point of the game. The setting, locations and realistic art style really showcase the destruction of the Chernobyl incident.  The developers really nailed being in a destroyed post apocalyptic nuclear death zone. Buildings are crumbling and dilapidated, broken vehicles litter the roads, small settlements of makeshift homes and building house some of the other inhabitants on the 'zone'. Every aspect of the game facilitates you feeling like you need to survive. With the updated engine, the game looks even better than before+ lighting effects + A new addition is factions. You can join a faction to gain unique quests or help them out in general. Joining one faction usually puts you at odds with another. You can choose not to join anybody.+ Another new addition is the upgrade system. Different armors/weapons have different upgrades that you can choose to buy making them more powerful/effective in combat. In order to unlock certain upgrades you first have to find the blueprints, usually found in stashes or given as quests rewards.+ Side Quests have been improved somewhat over the first game. Money and quest rewards are more valuable than before and the quests are a bit more varied. Completing quests feels more meaningful. + Game play is nearly identical to the first game. Gameplay consists of killing enemies as you traverse 'the zone', scavenging dead bodies and loot to find weapons, armor, ammo, health etc. Survival is a main underlying component with the game. Weapons and armor degrade over time making them less effective and need to be fixed or replaced, radiation levels have to be checked, getting shot or attacked by mutant animals require you to use bandages to stop bleeding, eating is required every so often and you also need to watch your weight limit. Carry too much and your stamina runs out very quickly forcing you to stop or walk until you regain it back.  + Gun battles are fun, fast and furious. Certain main missions puts you in unique situations which makes gun fights more fun and satisfying. Certain battles reminded me heavily of Half Life 2. For example one mission has you making your way across a deserted town as you clear the road of enemies. Unlike the first game where gun fights usually took place as you traverse the open environment to your next objective, Clear Sky has more focused concise battles tailored to the specific level.  +Variety of different weapons that feel unique+Sound EffectsThe Average:With the addition of Factions also comes brain dead AI companions. Like most games, when you go into battle with your teammates, you will do the majority of killing while your 'teammates' sit back and relax. Teammates can also push you aside with ease - a big problem if your aiming down sights ready to make the crucial head shot only to have one of your squad member run into you pushing you aside messing up your aim. The game features most of the same location as the first game with a few new additions. It doesn't hurt the game by any means as the locations and level design is fantastic however I also find it a bit lazy when developers heavily reuse assets from the previous game. Long load times. Minor bugs and glitches.The Bad: - (Minor spoiler Alert) There is a part near the middle of the game where you lose all your money without warning. From a story perspective it makes sense, this is a hostile environment and anything can go bad at any minute. From a gameplay perspective this is awful. All the work that went into saving your money so that you can eventually buy your favorite piece of armor or weapon is now gone. Not only was I frustrated but my desire to accomplish any more side quests was also diminished. -Locating artifacts is a chore and almost unnecessary in this game. Artifacts are items that you can equip that grant you specific bonuses to your stats. In order to actually find these artifacts, you have to first equip your detector, than walk around the level in the hopes it will detect something for you to find. I found the process to be  time consuming and boring. This was a big downgrade from the previous game. - This game is hard even on the medium setting. Right from the start enemies can kill you with relative ease leading to some very frustrating moments causing me to abuse quick save/load. ConclusionAlthough the game certainly retains a lot of good things from the first game while improving on certain aspects, the overall package is not as good. The pacing and difficulty being the biggest culprits. The addition of factions is a really good idea but not implemented as well as it should have been.  I enjoyed my time with the game but I was glad it was over. "

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear SkyIt has been a while since I last played it, but after noticing some updates for some mods I used to play and the lack of a review, I decided to write this.Anyway... What can I say? An aweful lot, but I'm going to keep it short. This review will touch on two aspects of the game; modded and unmodded. ModdedI'm recommending this game because of mods. The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series is among the most moddable game series out there. Despite this game being the weakest in the series, mods can quickly turn it into one of the strongest, if not the strongest. I've put more hours into this than I have into say, Shadow of Chernobyl or even Call of Pripyat (though between Misery and the recent release of Call of Chernobyl for CoP, my CoP playtime is catching up.Why? Simple really. A single mod called 'The Faction War' or TFW for short. It takes a wonderful mechanic brought into the series (but removed for some reason in CoP) and turns it into something more. What might this feature be? Faction wars, of course.Join one of the many factions and fight for supremacy, or go alone in the zone and fend for yourself against mutants, bandits or any factions you decide you don't like. It turns the game into an RTS of a sort, with reasonably large scale firefights - or, if you want to, quiet night-time operations.UnmoddedThe game is good without mods, but it is arguably the weakest in the series. It has an number of bugs which can be fixed through the use of mods and community patches. Other mods serve to enhance the story and gameplay, so by now you're getting the picture. You can play through the game fine, but you'll end up turning to mods to enhance, fix or even overhaul the game.I'll go into more detail another time, so for now this'll have to do.			"

												Best game series ever S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a wonderful rich story of scavengers, criminals, and treasure seakers looking for mysterious anomolous artifacts that contain certain properties around the Chernobyl power plant with secrets far beyond human comprehension (spelling is hard) Great releastic graphics for its time and amazing gameplay. Good Hunting S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Out of the 3 games I say this is the best of them all, most would disagree and say this is the worst but i find it a big improvement from the 1st and better story then the 3rdSome of the people who worked on the metro games worked on this game series and there new F2P game call Survarium (or something around that) by Vostok games (includes some of the original people from stalker) is being updated constantly with a battlefield mixed with Stalker gameplay.

												Clear Sky, in it's untouched state was unplayable for me until I installed the COMPLETE mod. At that point the game opened itself up to me, and I'm loving it nearly as much as SoC. Like the original, it's initally unforgiving, with an excellent soundtrack and a seriously ominous and unnerving world. The map is improved to give the player more detail as to who is around them and what their function and intentions are, and the interactions between the different factions are a lot easier to interpret, which makes intervening and helping people out a lot easier. You spend a bit of time re-treading old locations, which can be a bit disappointing. However, the areas are occupied by different factions with different goals and it's kind of nice to see how the area changed over time between this game and the SoC, to which Clear Sky is a prequel.It also has some new graphical features, particularly when it comes to lighting, that really brings out some more polish in the game's visuals, and makes any action performed during nightime a terrifying affair. This is not my favourite of the Stalker series - that remains SoC - but the world is still compelling and oppressive as balls, and the core mechanics are more refined than those of its predecessor, so it certainly is worthy of the player's attention after finishing SoC.

												Although all 3 Stalker games are fantastic, Clear Sky is my favourite. It is the most atmospheric of the 3, the most challenging, the biggest (yes it IS bigger than Call of Pripyat), and has the best soundtrack. Sadly it was also the buggiest at release and had some glichy cheating AI which coupled with the fairly high difficulty at the beginning put alot of people off. Everything been fixed up now more or less. It's still a tough game, especially the first few hours but put the time in and you will be rewarded with one of the all time great PC gaming experiences. I recommend it!			"

												Clear Sky tries to follow its predecessor - and fails miserably. Just take a look at some of these awesome features!- Hardly any atmosphere, nothing compared to SoC- Characters that have little to no originality and - well - no character. They just sit there and talk. Or they run around and are meaningless. These will probably die soon.- Even more bugs than the first game- Ridiculous AI (sees you in the dark with your lamp off, behind things, inside foliage... just everywhere, but every time you have allies, they are the worst you could imagine)- Incredibly monotonous gameplay -> Just shoot. Kill entire armies of soldiers on your very own, over and over again. Well, if you can spare some time, deal with brutally pugnacious mutants. It doesn't matter what kind of enemy you encounter - they're all mostly bulletproof, unless you hit them multiple times in the head with high-end gear.I'll just add that I actually play the community made ""Clear Sky Complete"" mod that is meant to ""ENHANCE"" the entire thing... seriously don't wanna see the vanilla original.There is exactly one positive point about this game, but solely for those who played the first one:+ Many of the areas from SoC are recognizable, but a little different. Veterans will revel in memories. And the new portions of the map are quite interesting as well..........BUT: Don't celebrate too much - 'cause if you just fell in love being ""home"" at the Cordon or the Garbage again - well, enjoy, because you most likely won't get there a second time. The story line is just too linear to find any sense in travelling back. Well - all in all it's really sad. But I wanted to have the entire trilogy, so i got the bundle. At least it was on sale.			"

												Russian Fallout100000000000/5But no seriously, ive only been a pc gamer for about, a year and a half. I had never heard of this game before, but when the steam wintersale went on during 2015, this game was recommended to me. It was only $4, and God i dont regret buying it.  The action, the factions, the map, everything is so amazing. The only thing wrong with this game is how innaccurate some of the guns are. I have found that the TRs 301 is the most accurate by far, making it my favorite weapon (even though im an AK person). I am only at the part where im about to head into Dark Valley, and ive been enjoying the game a ton. Defintely reccomend for anyone who enjoys open world, roleplaying, survival, shooting, and vodka.

												It's the second game of Stalker trilogy. After nearly 10 years, game is good at taking you its atmosphere. But lots of glitches, bugs (sometimes it can be helpful)... But it has some differences from the first game. You cannot find anomalies easily. I am in the last mission but i have only 2 anomalies on my belt. Because of not choosing any faction, i mostly stuck in the main missions as a mercenary. So without the side mission/ quest money, i couldn't find any new weapon, ammo, suit etc. I think if you are starter, you should choose a faction to experience 'complete game'. It is so hard without bandage, money, suit and weapon for last mission.			"

												(Before reading this review, read my review of stalker shadow of Chernobyl) http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197984765152/recommended/4500/(And just like before I played this game on the highest difficulty and WITHOUT MODS, and don’t start whining at me saying you need to use mods) Clear sky is a prequel and near the end happens at the same time as shadow of Chernobyl. In clear sky you play as a mercenary called Scar who is able to survive emissions and ends up working with the faction Clear sky, whose goal is to stop Strelok from reaching the middle of the zone where it is believed something catastrophic with happen.Clear sky does add a few new things into the game since now you can upgrade and repair weapons and armour, artefacts are much rarer and you need a detector to find them, you now have guides who can take you into different places, you can side with most factions, you now need slots for artefacts and you must have a minus radiation value artefact if you have a plus radiation one to counter it otherwise you will slowly die of radiation poisoning, and the hunger and thirst system was removed so food now just acts as health items and energy drinks are just to boost your stamina, but other than that this is very much the same as shadow of Chernobyl. Clear sky also improves a few things that were in shadow of Chernobyl, the map and PDA have been improved, most of the weapons are a bit more accurate than the previous game but they still aren’t great, moving is no longer headache inducing, and thankfully loading quick saves won’t cause the enemies to go back to their starting positions which can be right next to or in front or behind you and you'll get killed instantly. This is still a strangely compelling game but it still comes with problems from the previous game and it adds its own. The gunfights aren’t anywhere near as to what they were in the previous game but it is still a little random on whether you’ll get shot or not and the damage output. The amount of bandages and med kits used to stop you from bleeding out is random to the point where sometimes it will only take one bandage, but other times you can go through all of the bandages and med kits in your inventory. The map is incorrect with the directions used to go to this one area that’s south east of the red forest, you’d think you’d have to go to the exit pointing south east but that takes you to Garbage, you actually have to go to the NORTH exit point to get to the area that is SOUTH EAST of the red forest. The height difference between standing and crouching is two or three inches. Enemies can now throw grenades, they can throw grenades from over 100 yards away and they explode a second after they land and this is really annoying when you are trying to kill a group of enemies only to have a few grenades land at your feet.Your weapons jam far too often.Just like shadow of Chernobyl getting this game all comes down to whether you think you can put up with these problems and I actually enjoyed this a bit more than shadow of Chernobyl to a certain extent.

												5/10, crappy end game. If you're new to Stalker series, play SoC or Call of Pripyat.Clear Sky has it's moments. There are lots of well designed environments for geocaching. Day/night cycles highlight game's excellent shadow system. Anomaly artifacts are rare enough. Game works a lot like Shadow of Chernobyl in most aspects.On down side, some missions aren't that much fun on harder difficulty levels, there is little or no benefits from finding hidden caches, Faction Wars seems like afterthought and won't lend much to gameplay after starting area. Looting corpses for money is very easy. But those problems aren't nothing compared how bad end game is which must be probably one of the worst I've played. It's time-constrained pipe-running in midst of one-shotting grenade-spam enemies spawning from thin air. If you eventually grind it through by memorizing enemy positions, bugged end game makes you finally turn difficulty down and restarting from auto-save. Or go to YouTube for end video.			"

												The stupid brother of SoC and COPI loved Stalker SoC and CoP and finishes both several times. But Clear Sky has just too many flaws. First the difficulty is quite high, what i usually like. But it`s not high because the enemies are very clever. They are not dumb either and gun fights can be really fun, when you are not pushed in the line of fire by a NPC or because even simple bandits see you in the dark while you can`t even see the weapon in your hand. They will shoot you from far far away with with their rusty pistols. The problem is you can`t skip the night, so you have to wait for an hour realtime(!) or so untill it becomes day or you will die even more often than you already do during daytime. And then the controls: Awful! Who ever came up with the idea that you actually have two kinds of crouching from which one is such a small change to your standing position, that it`s more or less useless and the other one is only possible to execute, when you are crouched in the first postion beforehand. Who ever invented this should be banned from making videos games for ever. So you die most often because of the crappy controls and poor design choices and not because of the smart enemies. Two examples for how bad the level design can be: The beginning of the game in the swamps. 1st. The Water is radioactive and will kill you, but because of the high grass, you can`t see it most of the time. So you just stare at the map ignoring 98% of the screen to make your way and try to follow the totaly random and confusing mission messeges which are popping up every few seconds. One second a mission starts ""defend x"" a second later (you had no chance to get there in time) "" mission defedning x canceled"" and you don`t even know why. So You run in the opposite direction (staring at the map) to do another mission like the first one. But then again the first mission popps up again: ""defend x"". And a few more seconds later these missions can be canceled again or fail without any chance to accomplish them.  At another point the game leads you to a spot out of a canal where you are supposed start a mission in a new area, but there is no way to pass the MG-nest which lies between you and the area where you need to go. You are literary sitting in a trap , sourrounded by barbwire, while on the only open side the machinegun awaits to kill you in a split second. This is by far the worst level design I have seen in a game for a long time. For the whole game F5 and F9 will be your most used keys. You will look at the loading screen like alot. And that`s the reason why there is never a constant flow of gaming. There is no chance that Clear Sky developes an atmosphere like the one the other stalker games are known for. It`s just not enjoyable and that`s a shame, because the other two games are awesome. Play these and skip this one, you are not missing anything.			"

												This game has many things inside. However over 30% of them are totally broken. But even than this game is great and atmospheric. Shows the zone before the catastrophy. Instead of billions of mutants and 3 days of march without meeting a person u have a game in which u can join a fraction (freedom,duty,bandits[broken but joined and won the game anyway],loners[Loners? Wait what? How can u have a society of loners????? If u are in a group u are not a loner anymore!] and play the game ur way. Not like in shadow of chernobyl the ending is much less scary and much more fair to the player. Simiulary the entire game is much more fair to the player. But still not fair enough. For example if u join bandits every single fraction in game is going to become hostile towards u! So dont join bandits at beggining of the game cuz you wont be able to play the game and finish the singleplayer. Fraction wars are completely BROKEN and Boooooooooooooring and there is a ♥♥♥♥ load of bugs,glitches and stupidity. However it still gives lots of fun and makes ur brain grow.

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R Clear Sky is a Prequel to the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl. Released in 2008, It tells an alternate timeline story of ""The Zone"", which is the highly contaminated and radioactive area surrounding the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant and neighboring areas, after a second explosion occurs at the plant. S.T.A.L.K.E.R's are scavengers who traverse the Zone in search of Artifacts, as Guides, Mercenaries, and for research related operations. In this prequel, which is recommended prior to playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl, you play as a S.T.A.L.K.E.R known as Scar, who is injured by an unknown energy emission, while escorting scientists through the zone. Somehow Scar survives and finds himself at Clear Sky, a research colony trying to understand what is happening to the Zone. From here you begin your journey into the Zone, to unlock it's mysteries, as well as to save Clear Sky from the dangers at their gates. S.T.A.L.K.E.R Clear Sky, came after S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl, so it plays much the same way. You have a set amount of inventory space, an array of weaponry to loot or purchase, armor to help keep you alive, as well as medpac's, bandages, grenades and more. Mods exist for the S.T.A.L.K.E.R games, which are extremely popular such as The Stalker Complete set, Misery, and the Oblivion Mod, all of which, change the game mechanics and overhaul the games graphics. S.T.A.L.K.E.R has been a decent Horror FPS series, and spawned another sequel following the events of Shadow of Chernobyl called, S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call of Pripyat. If you like games such as Fear, Resident Evil, Silent Hill, you should enjoy S.T.A.L.K.E.R Clear Sky. Again, it is the second game in the series, but is meant to be a prequel to S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl, so I recomment playing Clear Sky first.			"

												GSC Game World had an unexpected hit with S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl and they keep the momentum going by developing a prequel and pushing it out the door in about a year and a half after Shadow's release.S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky had some tough shoes to fill. Expectations were very high and whlist it can't match the first for gameplay, it manages to deliver on the atmosphere and adds some new gameplay elements which can be considered either frustrating or brilliant.You play as Zone guide and veteran S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Scar who, after amazingly surviving a deadly emission, is rescued by an unknown faction known as Clear Sky. Located in the Swamps, you must work with them secretly to find out why the zone is getting worse.The game is a 50/50 mix of areas seen in Shadow of Chernobyl and brand new areas. The old areas have some pretty big changes to them and areas that were safe in the first game might be a complete nightmare this time around and vice versa.The game focuses a lot of its first half on the war between the various factions located in the Zone. You are free, once outside the Swamps, to join any faction you want (Freedom, Duty, Stalkers, even the Bandits) and have the privliges that faction offers, all whilst still secretly working for the Clear Sky faction that saved your life.The game has had some of its more interesting elements removed; your character no longer needs to eat and drink to stay alive, the systems for detecting how visible you are and how much noise you are making have also been removed.Finding artifacts is now a bit more challenging then before; in Shadow of Chernobyl they would be bobbing up and down in random places around the Zone and you could just run up to them and pick them up maybe whilst avoiding some anomolies. In Clear Sky, artifacts are now invisible but you have a detector that can guide you to them, you just have to work your way through the deadly anomalies, get close to it and it appears for you to collect. This risk/reward mechanism enhances the values of artifacts greatly.The story sadly isn't as interesting as the first game and instead of most of the spoken dialogue being in Ukranian like in the first game, it has been translated into very rough English that sounds forced and out of place. This can take away from some of the atmosphere of being a foreigner in a completely strange environment.The game also has a nasty habit of making enemies invincible unless you are close enough. No more picking off people from a distance which can be incredibly frustrating at times.It isn't as good as Shadow of Chernobyl story-wise and mechanicly but the atmosphere and general improvements make up for it. A worthy addition to the series and worth playing!P.S. You can grab the ""CLEAR SKY COMPLETE"" modification to fix crash to desktop bugs and translation problems.			"

												Great game. 8/10.Graphics are amazing, and still beautiful in 2015. I played it a long time ago and it's even better now than I remember. Patched up pretty well, doesn't crash or glitch as much as it used to. In fact, it never crashed when I played it this time round, except a couple of times when fiddling with settings. AI is so much better than in Shadow of Chernobyl, and dialogue is voiced (not your character's voice unfortunately), even has full English dialogue (half of combat shouting is in Russian, and it's better that way).Super immersive, nice music. There is a bug with music where it randomly cuts off when exploring, dunno what's with that. Pretty unfortunate considering the ambient music when exploring is fantasticly immersive. Also ambient sounds are great. Dynamic music in settings is bleh, it basically turns on combat music to play when in combat, and that isn't really fun.Storyline is magnificent, and graphics are insane. This game was made in '08 and has god rays, bump maps, the lot. The Map is huge, exploring is extremely rewarding and side quests are fun. Extremely well optimized as well for both nVidia and AMD cards. Great game.My biggest problem with it is the ending mission and cutscene. The cutscene left too much in the open, it didn't really explain that everyone was being brainwashed or whatever, or that this is how stalkers are made into fanatic monolith worshippers. The ending mission was just a disaster, once you (SPOILERS AHEAD) enter Chernobyl NPP you're supposed to attack Strelok, and honestly it feels like they rushed the game at the end there. Pretty bad mission. Fully scripted and badly made. Like a mission I would've made in Spore Galactic Adventures. Animations were terrible in the end, jesus.So the final mission was super anti-climatic and actually more hilarious and sad than anything else. Too bad, for such a great game. Kinda like Mass Effect 3, I guess. Lowered my rating from 9 to 8.Oh yeah, and I recommend playing in master difficulty, so much more fun and realistic that way. Headshots are instakills.			"

												Is an auto save really THAT difficult? I hate the copious amount of dying and restarting from a time an hour ago because everytime I complete a mission I assume it saves. Well guess what, this game next to NEVER saves! Maybe they thought the autosave would be too easy or less realistic you say?! Well I say Bull&$#!, because, its WAY less realistic to keep pressing esc it open a menu in the middle of a firefight to save, its rediculous. It strips away what would have been a much better and improved STALKER. This HUGE, GIGANTIC, HUMONGOUS, even TITANIC issue completely detracts from the game and it is and/or was such a simple problem that should have been fixed in the first place. How did you manage to fix all the other flaws and MISS THIS ONE!!! I supposed I would still reccomend this game, but, with a caution that unless you get into the habit of interrupting the game to save, you'll probably end up throwing your computer across the room after replaying the same mission 5 or 6 times.

Because this game is basically a remake of shadow of chernobyl, there is no need to  withstand this broken experience! IF you want to play it anyways be prepared for at least 5 minutes loading screens and quicksave alot because when the crashes comes you wish you had some sedative pills or you will probably break something!

												In spite of the somewhat anti-climactic ending, this is a solid game and one of the best in the series. Even at a lower difficulty, players are challenged by ever-tougher syndicate enemies from Looters to the well-armed and armoured Monolith bad guys. The fighting during the Hospital and Chernyobal scenarios get tough and will test the players ability to carefully hoard and use dwindiling health supplies [ I ended the game with nothing left than one bandage and one loaf of bread ] Ammo is largely what you can loot off of the dead. Great elements of urban street fighting and the wider spaces of the swamps and forests which have helped make this such a good game. Two thumbs up.			"

												HIGHLY recommend skipping this game in the trilogy. This game is poorly optimized, poor mechanics and poor story. I loved the first Stalker, SoC. But this is just terrible. All human enemies prefer using pinpoint accurate grenades set right at your feet, which make you get out of cover immediately or get 1 shot, which then gets you hit by their bullets, which then makes you bleed and have to use 3 bandages and probably a medkit. The whole game is just SoC with turf wars, which is just tedious in its own right. I love difficult games, but this isn't difficult, it's poorly designed. All NPC's seem to have a gigantic hitbox surrounding them, not in the way that it's easier to shoot them, but in the way that if you are in their way when they are walking, they will push you 10 feet from them... typically inside an immovable object, which gets you stuck and you have to reload a save. I just wanted to finish this awful game just to say I played through all 3 games, but when the game finally started crashing when I reached the Red Forest, and corrupted my save file on the 2nd crash, I gave up and hit the uninstall button. For anyone wondering, this game doesn't really tell you anything you already didnt' know from SoC, so you aren't missing any information by not playing it.			"

												This is an odd game in the series. It has a heavier focus on combat over anomolies. My main complaint was the mess that is the Faction Wars, lopsided sides mean either a battle up or downhill depending on your faction, assuming you can even finish without squads getting stuck or endless assaults. It is a solid game, but it gives way to linear final areas with little warning leaving your character possibly VERY under prepared.Despite this fans have unofficial mods and patches that greatly enhance the game. Overall I got 35 hours out of it, being the fan of the STALKER series I have to say it is worth playing at least once. I value it at $20, considering it's normal price is $10 if it goes on a steam sale definitely worth a buy.			"

												STALKER Clear Sky review, by Filthy NickGraphics:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well the graphics aren't that good, the game runs on the X-RAY 1.5 engine, it's a very old engine, I  beleve it was introduced somewhere in 2002. with Oblivion Lost (Yes, STALKER was suposed  to be called Oblivion Lost). Xray engine is full of bugs. Damn bugs, anyway this is the Xray engine 1.5 so it's in the ""top form"". It's stable if you use the vanila game.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gameplay:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------STALKER is one of those games, when you start playing them you just can't stop, it's too good, my favorite thing about this game is the faction war (install Clear Skies mod for the better expiriance), you feel like the factions are in a real war. At the very start of the game you need to clear out the Regenade scum so that Clear Sky can take over the swamp.When you are short on cash there is always artefact hunting, with a detector you can find these things so called artefacts, you can sell them for a nice ammount of cash. The worst thing is when you are in a fight and then your weapon jams, that one second may be the diference bettwen life and death, that's why you always need to reparir your gear.Clear Sky is the first STALKER game that features weapons/suit upgrades, every upgrade has its pros and cons. Weapons in this game use a realistic bullet physics, they have tracers and everything, bullets will fall after some time so don't expect to kill somebody that is 200m from  you with no calculation or what so ever.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------VERDICT:Would I recomend this game? ♥♥♥♥ yeah I would, I got this on steam just because there was a sale, I have the retail version of the game. Oh yeah , all of you who bought the game as a retail copy I suggest you buy it on steam, steam  version is really stable unlike the retail version.8/10Engine is old, gameplay is damn good, crashes sometimes, get mods for it, it's way better with mods.

												Large majority of the maps are recycled from Shadow of Chernobyl. It is a prequel, so the maps were altered to fit with the lore accordingly. The first half is basically just retreading areas like the Cordon/Garbage. It's interesting to see how things in the world were before ""The Marked One"" arrived, though it does begin to feel incredibly dull as you basically go through the same things all over again. Clear Sky has the most densely packed world of the series though -- you can't walk for two minutes without bumping into a squad or a hub of some sort. Lone empty buildings were repurposed left and right to pack factions. It takes away from the lone feeling of the other installments in favor of a quicker pace.Tough recommendation. One of the only definitive positives are he cooler new features such as the nonlinear armor/weapon mods. Through my 50~ hour playthrough there were high points, but mostly lower ones. It's obvious the game was rushed, not just through its numerous bugs. Easiest game in the series. at its worst;- worst engine performance in the entire series- faction system very buggy at times, very limited- really poorly balanced, becomes overly easy later on through overpowered weapons + artifacts granting greater inventory limit - - very underwhelming ending.- - - Crashes ALOT.  maybe two dozen crashes throughout my original playthroughI like the series enough to recommend such a heavily flawed game, though if you're more of a passive fan then go straight to CoP			"

The buggy graphics issuesThe bad storytellingThe poorly written code and dialogue at partsThe way the economy is done20 hours. Thats how long it is before the game is scary.20+ hours is less ""stalker"" territory, and more ""Victim of insane horror""Being a stalker requires good decision making and smart fight picking, ammo conservation and currency manipulation skills.Thats the first 20 hours.8/10. clear skies mod is almost proprietary to enjoy the game to full extent(PROTIP: Give it 4-7 hours to settle in, shotguns become obselete pre-12 hours.)

												Unpopular opinion, but Clear Sky is the best STALKER-game imo. I really love the settings, the weather variations, the fractions makes sense. The fractionwars is also a really cool feature. Just make sure to choose the right faction. For example, I really hated the Red Forest as it scared the sh*t out of me so I sided with Duty to get the guides for fast travelling to guide me to the safe spot in Red Forest. That, on the other hand made me an enemy to Freedom, which controls most of the Military Warehouses, making that area even harder than it already is with mutants, Zombiefied and Monoliths. But the point is, the option to join factions and wage war is totally awesome.One bad thing is that there is no 'cheatcommands' in the console for this game. You dont like cheating? Well neither do I, but lets make something very clear, Clear Sky is full of bugs. For instance, after I conquered Freedoms base with Duty, Freedom launched an assault on their old base, I was inside, and Duty locked the doors. So basically no-one could get in or out. On the plus side, its really easy to install mods that allow you to ghost/noclip through doors and resolve the issue. Also you can get stuck in holes and betwewen rocks and cant get out. These mods helps with that.The storyline is also really cool, but so are the storylines in the other STALKER games. I wont say anything about it to avoid spoiling it.So to summarize it, a really cool game in a postapocalyptic Chernobyl/Ukrainian rural area full with mutated animals, monsters, Stalkers(humans) and filled with anomalies and artifacts, extremely dangerous weather and some cool East and West-based weapon that you can customize and modify to suit your needs.The story itself isnt that long, you could easily get this game done in a couple of hours. But the sidequests, and of course the fraction wars, litterally eats your time up. And if that wasnt enough, there are tons of mods that adds new content. For the small prize it costs nowadays, there is nothing to think about. Buy it.			"

												Consider this a recommendation for the entire STALKER series so far (latest as of this being Call of Pripyat). The STALKER games are FPS/Survival Horror/RPG hybrids where the emphasis is on the FPS gunplay and the survival elements.You can get thirsty or hungry or need sleep and have to manage those needs alongside that of the deteriorating conditions of your weapons and armors. Ammunition, food, and drink needed to survive are scarce, but can be traded for with almost anyone if you have the right amount of goods or money to sacrifice for it. The game has large maps you can travel between like a sandbox game, and the gunplay is some of the tightest I've seen with really good gun physics. The games also have a wildlife simulation system similar to the one in place in FarCry 3 in a way; animals and mutants will run around and do their own thing after they spawn and kill each other (and maybe you) for survival or food.Despite the large amount of freedom these games afford you to carve your own path, they feel very focused and are best approached with a strategic mindset.

												I enjoyed this game a lot when it first came out. It's highly customizable and there is a huge community constantly pumping out mods and tweaks for this series.You play a russian scoundral, your goal is to infiltrate the zone (Chernobyl). Along the way you will meet mutant pig dogs, cows with human faces, bandits, freedom fighters, nazis, scientists. You name it.The world is basically persistent and you will have to do things to aid your particular faction, like kill bandits or mutants, find vodka, whatever.  The different npc factions are constantly fighting over parts of the zone and you are caught in the middle.Will you become a stoner and join the freedom faction?Will you become a cold hearted killer and join the duty faction?It's up to you, run around and kill stuff and steal radio-active thingys that give you bonus states. If you are a sci-fi fan or a shooter fan you should definitely try this game.			"

												I wish I had looked up some more about this game before I bought it. People say this one is the weakest in the series, and though I haven't played the others, Clear Sky didn't really intice me to do so. I just beat it, and I must say, the whole game was mediocre at it's best, annoying at it's worst. It's buggy, and even when it's not buggy the bullet sponge enemies (and player character) just make it a bit irritating. It's not that hard, I played through the whole game with the starting armor, and if you ever worry you're getting low on money, medical supplies, or ammo, fret not, for the endless supply of military soldiers in Cordon will practically hand over as much of all of the above as you need. The only difficulty in the game stemmed from the necessity to put 1-2 whole extended mags of armor piercing rounds into snorks before they died, yet they could kill you with a couple kicks. Still, even that problem is easily solved with a SPAS.When its not bullet sponges and bugs that are annoying you, its invisible walls that are blocking an area that is totally physically accessable in appearance. Mods like SRP (Sky Reclamation Project) include a lot of bug fixes, and I'm to understand that there are mods to remove invisible walls (I didn't bother to try any mods whatsoever); however, the vanilla game was still a disappointment, though, at times, not entirely unenjoyable.The concept is interesting, but the execution was sub par, at least for this entry in the series. I can't suggest it.			"

												the worst out of the three stalkers by far. honestly not even worth modding and playing a second time but if thats your kind of thing go for it.every single enemy is the video game adaptation of the guy from the navy seal copypasta. no matter where you're hiding or how far away you are from them they will scope you out and pop you in the head like its nothing. they also have an absurd amount of merc-seeking grenades on hand at any given time that are always cooked to perfection so you have little to no time to get out of the way before you're bloodsucker chow. not to mention they all like to throw them at the same time so enjoy having 5-6 grenades directly at your feet at least twice during a firefight.theres also the faction mechanic, funnily enough absent from CoP but its easy to see why. the whole system was half ♥♥♥♥♥ and only relevant in the first hour or two of the game. after that you can pretty much ignore it since it doesnt really affect anything. it would have been a great free-play mechanic but clear sky lacks that entirely.also the story is bad, like really REALLY bad. what starts out as a simple ""go find strelok and stop him from getting to the center of the zone ok"" turns into a long convoluted fetch quest that can be boiled down to ""person A has details on where strelok could be but wont tell you until you do a task, then person A will tell you to go to person B and person B will have you do an exceedingly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t task to then tell you to go to person C who does the same exact thing until you finally have a romp through limansk which might as well be you running naked through a football field while a bunch of russian dudes hopped up on cocaine shoot at you from all angles.""it ain't worth playing. its a prequel to ShoC and really adds nothing to the series as a whole. you could just straight up ignore this game and play ShoC and CoP and you'd get just a good experience as any.

												Disappointing compared to SoC. The upgrade system is a cool idea, but is implemented oddly. Your weapons flat out suck until you invest thousands of rubles in upgrades. You won't be able to headshot an enemy standing twenty yards away with many stock weapons. The pistols and shotguns you start out with seem to shoot weaponized cotton candy bullets.There's no more magic to exploring and getting ambushed by an unseen enemy. As part of the faction wars system, pretty much every enemy shows up on the map, even mutants. Faction wars itself is a huge disappointment. It's a cool idea implemented horribly. Forget Duty and Freedom, it seems that every faction is out for turf! They even turned Loners into a faction. Loners are not a faction, they're the absence of a faction! Beyond the lore issues, there's also gameplay issues.I'll capture an outpost and use a bunch of ammo because my stock AR has like a three foot spread at twenty meters. The enemy faction will then constantly send squads to take back that position. Naturally, the men defending it get whittled away, and I'm likely in no position to help. I was taking over the main bandit base in Garbage, only to have all my work be for nothing because bandits captured the southwest entrance for the billionth time. It's a huge test of patience.Did I mention the grenade spam? Because there's tons of it. Enemies throw a lot of grenades and have amazing accuracy with them. It reaches CoD: WaW levels of stupid with its grenade spam.The story is nothing special. I looked it up out of frustration with the game. The most important thing it does is explain why Strelok ended up brainwashed at the start of ShOC, which I didn't care much about. The Clear Sky faction doesn't matter much in the larger lore.At least I got this game in a sale. The way I look at it, I got Call of Pripyat for 50% off and Clear Sky for free. Speaking of which, I'm moving on to Call of Pripyat now, supposedly the series' magnum opus. Hopefully it's better than this.			"

												I've been playing FPS games since mid 90's, and play wise, this is a great idea but implemented poorly, I liked the first STALKER, and i was hoping to get a little bit of that FPS/RPG on this new release, but it made it terrible slow and counter intuitive. The gameplay is not refined, and it gets frustrating very easily with not really enough learning curve.Graphics? looks good, Audio: not great, very easy to overlap ""NPCs Speeches"" if you move around quick, game movement is jumpy sometimes (like character physics are somewhere off), the weight system does not really help on making the game more enjoyable. I'm really disapointed, and i would ask for a refund if i could, but this game came on a Bundle with several others.Look somewhere else for a post-apocalyptic RPG/FPS, Fallouts are great plase to start.

												To fans of the STALKER series: This game is avoidable. If you are a true die-hard you can still give it a go, but it isn't as atmospheric and ""stalkery"" as Shadow of Chhernobyl, and nowhere near as modern and well featured as Call of Pripyat. To those who have never played a STALKER game: Please don't let this be your first.			"

												Considered to be the worst out of the Trilogy of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series, but even with that it is one of the best open world, post-apocalyptic RPG  out there, and in no way does it disappoint even a newcomer to the series. The atmosphere is grim and creepy as you roam around the Nuclear aftermath that is the Zone. The A.I is very good, creature designs are amazing and fit the game very well with loads of loot gather and quests to embark on. When it comes to the glitches that this game can sometimes suffer from, an easy download of the ""CLEAR SKY COMPLETE"" should tackle most of these issues whilst also polishing the experience.8 cheeki breekis / 10			"

												I don't know if STALKERs are ever a good game, but after SoC (which I sort of liked apart the sick difficulty and a nasty bug which gave me wrong ending) I didn't learn anything and I made the mistake of starting Clear Sky too with the hardest difficulty and after about half game it's just so hard it isn't fun at all. Pretty much only headshots kill enemies and you will be killed by one headshot too. Even more annoying is that enemies will spot you crouching 100 meters away and instantly kill you alot of times, but if you just run around pointlessly they hardly ever hit you. If you play vanilla game even the latest version is quite buggy.Luckily you can just skip lot of the useless gang war part, but that's pretty much only thing you can grind money with. If you upgrade your first scoped rifle a bit you can end the game with it. Anomalies are very hard to find and you don't get to keep any anomalies from quests so it's all extra work. I don't know if it's the difficulty or some patch, but in youtube most people finish the game shooting through a fence and in my version that doesn't do any damage so I think I loaded the game about 200 times to finish the final battle. And someone said there's about 1 hour of the game left at one stage and I'm quite sure it took me about 12 hours to finish after that, because it's just save after killing every enemy or get killed and reload all the time.Also the storyline in the game is weak. Maybe at 1 or 2 points there's a wow effect because of SoC, but other than that it's just boring.			"

												Being a fan of the other 2 games in the series I bought this one expecting another great FPS but what a steaming pile of crap I stepped in. I could only get through about 6 hours of playing it before I felt like I was totally wasting my time. The combat is probably the worst I've ever experienced. I've tried a variety of weapons, upgraded damage and accuracy on some, and still the enemies just seem unaffected by me unloading all my ammo into them while they kill me with ease. The armor they start you with is totally worthless as are the guns. I thought I just needed to explore a little to get better equipment and upgrade things but even that didn't help. Because the combat system is totally broken that makes it near impossible to accomplish anything since most of the quests are about attacking or defending something which is hard to do when your equipment is totally ineffective. To make it worse, the trade system sucks too. Find a gun worth 1000? You'll probably be able to sell it for 50. Good luck saving up to mod your weapons and armor at that rate. Then again, the upgrades don't help so why bother.With the combat and trade systems being total garbage, I just don't see any reason to continue playing this game. There are much better games out there that are more worthwhile. I've heard certain aspects of the game can be fixed with mods but you know what works better than hunting down mods to fix a crappy game? Installing a better game that works right from the start. Skip this one and spend your money elsewhere.			"

												The best version of a fantastic open world wasteland franchise. Like the Metro series, STALKER is a post-apoctolypic semi-mysitcal (Russians seem to like having paranormal elements in thier scifi) Russian game. However, while the Metro series is linear (yet finds room for female characters) STALKER is almost totally open (yet almost totally empty of women). Also unlike Metro, STALKER tends to run fairly well on my machine.Clear Sky is an enhancement of the STALKER formula. Several addtions are present, not the least of which are gun mods (your favorite weapons can be useful forever now, instead of quickly replaced whenever a new gun appears) and a more interesting story. If your like me and Fallout never really did it for you, give this game a shot.			"

												I've played S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky just after discovering Shadow of Tchernobyl.Except some improvements in the rendering engine (mostly lighting) and the interface (HUD and Inventory), the gameplay is mostly the same, so you won't be lost in this new opus.The most important element of gameplay provided here is the Mechanic guy, who can repair and upgrade your equipment (armor, weapons). Being able to customize your gear early really add to the game.In spite of this, I encountered a huge difficulty wall after cleaning the ""swamp"". After emerging from a huge pipe, I'm confronted with about 20 soldiers and a huge machinegun. This was a halt for me and I never succeeded in exploring what the game had to offer.I didn't like it because I played leisurely in easy mode (that was hard enough for me). I would have accepted it after like 4 to 5h of play, like in Shadow of Tchernobyl, when you emerge inside the soldier camp !So in spite of its qualities, I really cannot recommend this game who doesn't want to be played even in easy mode.

It's much like the previous game, with a new character, and new storyline.

												Maybe the game just isn't for me but here are some of the reasons why I dislike it.Weapons and ammo are named for people who like guns in real life rather than being named so that gamers can easily identify what is what at a seconds glance. The bleeding mechanic is annoying. You get bleeding for pretty much any hit so you better scavenge any and all healing items (apart from food which is just going to weigh you down) you come across.Your weapons rarely feel like they have an ""impact"" on enemies. You can hit an enemy 8 times with a weapon and they barely look like they are harmed by it. There is no limping, no slowing down of movements, no trying to escape when their life is too low, no stumble when hit by a heavy impact weapon like a shotgun. The only times it feels like your weapons have an impact is when you hit an enemy in the head at which point they're instakilled.Combat in general is tedious. You have to attack multiple enemies and they all take so many bullets (unless you manage to get good headshots (which isn't easy with how inaccurate weapons are)) to go down while you only need to take a handful to die. You end up playing pop a mole from cover most of the time and there is rarely any other tactic to use since if you kill an enemy pretty much all other enemies are alerted to your presence so sneaking is out of the question. And maybe it is just because I never found a good long range weapon but sniping wasn't viable for me. Neither was storming the place either. It's pretty much just pop a mole from cover for the most part.The dialogue in the game is ""topic dialogue"". Meaning that your character asks questions and the NPC's spew out paragraphs of exposition. I don't care for this kind of dialogue as characters just end up being meat shield/walking lore pamphlets.I'm not well versed with this regions names, culture and dialects so for me every character blended together with one another. Pretty much no one stood out so I ended up not caring about any of them.On that note, I don't even care about the main character. From what I saw during my playtime you are some random ♥♥♥♥ with amnesia or whatever who can survive strange emissions but they will gradually harm you until you die so you need to go to the center of the zone in order to find answers. However, since the character you play as has pretty much no personality or backstory or even motive to go into the zone (from what I understand the outside world isn't completely ♥♥♥♥ed up so why couldn't ""Scar"" just leave if the emissions are so harmful in the zone?) I don't care about him. I don't care about wanting to solve this mystery because the game gives me ♥♥♥♥ all of an incentive to solve it. I just don't care.Anyway, whenever I play a game for a while to get a good feel for it I sit down and think about the game as to why I'm playing it and why I should continue. So is the game challenging? Well, no. It is at first, but once you figure out how the mechanics work it stops being challenging and just grows frustrating or tedious. Does the game have an amazing story? Not really, as I explained above. Is the game at least a fun time consumer to just waste time in? Not really. The gameworld is pretty barren for the most part and all you find is anomolies and enemies which quickly get repetitive and boring.Does it at least have an amazing atmosphere to immerse into? Not really. It doesn't feel dark or dreary or anything really. It feels cartoonish if anything.Like I said, it might just not be the kind of game for me but I can't see any reason to keep playing it. The story never grabbed me, the characters blend together, the world is barren (apart from enemies), the combat gets repetitive and tedious and the atmosphere is lacking.			"

You get bleeding for pretty much any hit so you better scavenge any and all healing items (apart from food which is just going to weigh you down) you come across.Your weapons rarely feel like they have an ""impact"" on enemies. You can hit an enemy 8 times with a weapon and they barely look like they are harmed by it. There is no limping, no slowing down of movements, no trying to escape when their life is too low, no stumble when hit by a heavy impact weapon like a shotgun. The only times it feels like your weapons have an impact is when you hit an enemy in the head at which point they're instakilled.Combat in general is tedious. You have to attack multiple enemies and they all take so many bullets (unless you manage to get good headshots (which isn't easy with how inaccurate weapons are)) to go down while you only need to take a handful to die. You end up playing pop a mole from cover most of the time and there is rarely any other tactic to use since if you kill an enemy pretty much all other enemies are alerted to your presence so sneaking is out of the question. And maybe it is just because I never found a good long range weapon but sniping wasn't viable for me. Neither was storming the place either. It's pretty much just pop a mole from cover for the most part.The dialogue in the game is ""topic dialogue"". Meaning that your character asks questions and the NPC's spew out paragraphs of exposition. I don't care for this kind of dialogue as characters just end up being meat shield/walking lore pamphlets.I'm not well versed with this regions names, culture and dialects so for me every character blended together with one another. Pretty much no one stood out so I ended up not caring about any of them.On that note, I don't even care about the main character. From what I saw during my playtime you are some random ♥♥♥♥ with amnesia or whatever who can survive strange emissions but they will gradually harm you until you die so you need to go to the center of the zone in order to find answers. However, since the character you play as has pretty much no personality or backstory or even motive to go into the zone (from what I understand the outside world isn't completely ♥♥♥♥ed up so why couldn't ""Scar"" just leave if the emissions are so harmful in the zone?) I don't care about him. I don't care about wanting to solve this mystery because the game gives me ♥♥♥♥ all of an incentive to solve it. I just don't care.Anyway, whenever I play a game for a while to get a good feel for it I sit down and think about the game as to why I'm playing it and why I should continue. So is the game challenging? Well, no. It is at first, but once you figure out how the mechanics work it stops being challenging and just grows frustrating or tedious. Does the game have an amazing story? Not really, as I explained above. Is the game at least a fun time consumer to just waste time in? Not really. The gameworld is pretty barren for the most part and all you find is anomolies and enemies which quickly get repetitive and boring.Does it at least have an amazing atmosphere to immerse into? Not really. It doesn't feel dark or dreary or anything really. It feels cartoonish if anything.Like I said, it might just not be the kind of game for me but I can't see any reason to keep playing it. The story never grabbed me, the characters blend together, the world is barren (apart from enemies), the combat gets repetitive and tedious and the atmosphere is lacking.			"

												This game makes me feel sad. I love all the S.T.A.L.K.E.R games except for this one. This one is not considered a STALKER game for me, it feels more like Farcry 2, it's not dark as STALKER Shadow of Chernobyl and Call of Pripiyat, the character is also not so interesting like the others, the history of this game is... Meh, it's different from Shadow of Chernobyl. Also the game doesn't makes sense sometimes, I got stuck in the part where I had to get out of the swamps but military was shooting me with a ♥♥♥♥ing minigun that killed me in two seconds, so I decided to go north, then I had to go across STALKER's (that aren't nice like the STALKER's from the other games) but they said "" This is STALKER territory, you're not welcome here "" so I had to stay there or cross that ♥♥♥♥ing bridge running, then they shot me and I became an enemy of the most important faction in the game... This doesn't make sense! I tried many times to go across the miltary too but I failed. I got so angry that I installed Call of Pripyat so I could play a better gamer.If you want a good STALKER, play Shadow of Chernobyl  and Call of Pripyat (in that order, otherwise history won't make sense and you'll lose a good plot that SoC was).

And the sense of purpose that drove me through the first (insanely difficult) STALKER is missing here. There is also no sign of the ultra-cool storyline that popped up just often enough in the first game.Oh, and the enemy still can head shoot you in pitch dark when you are hiding behind a tree.Not recommended.

												TL:DR version:Good game. Not as good as the first game Shaodw Of Chernobyl as this one shows all the signs of a rushed game. But with some mods installed it's still very enjoyable.Long version:Prequel to the first STALKER game Shadow Of Chernobyl (SOC). Compared to the first one, which is a masterpiece, this game is short, buggier, and just generally a rushed game.They only made like 2 new maps while reusing all the textures and maps from SOC yet still manage to code it badly so it's full of bugs. Simply a lackluster effort.IMPORTANT TIP:DO NOT USE QUICK-SAVE QUICK-LOAD FUNCTION BUILT INTO THE GAME UNLESS YOU WANT TO HAVE CORRUPTED SAVEFILE THAT FORCE YOU TO START THE GAME OVER.So, in order to enjoy this, you will need community-made ""mods"", or patches since they fix bugs the developers are too lazy to fix.Sky Reclamation Project (SRP) (thank you Decane)http://www.gsc-game.com/index.php?t=community&s=forums&s_game_type=xr2&thm_page=1&thm_id=23248&sec_id=19This mod is a must as it fixes many game-crashing issues and it changes no gameplay so you can play the game how it's meant to be played.Clear Sky Complete (CS COMPLETE) (thank you Pavel)http://artistpavel.blogspot.ca/2010/01/mod-clear-sky-complete.htmlThe COMPLETE mods for the STALKER games are nice because they make the game look and sound better and play better. HOWEVER, even though this mod contains SRP, the SRP is an early version and does NOT include many fixes the most current version of SRP has. You WILL encounter game crashes and maybe even CORRUPT savefiles with this so use at your own risk.Now if you have some modding experience or some general knowledge of how script mods work then you can merge the up-to-date version of SRP with CS COMPLETE.  This is what I did so I can enjoy good graphcis+sound with no crashes.			"

												If I were going to be as fair with this review as this game was with me, it would be a one-sided argument of anger and frustration, lined with bits of compliments. However, I'm going to give this game something it never gave me: A ten second head start and a bandage when I really needed it,So for starters, let's be genuinely honest here; This is the most unique shooter experience I've ever dealt with. For starters, I've never played a game in which you fight armies of angry Russians armed with Iron Curtain weapons and even a few westernized weapons while I only have weapons with effective equivalence of Airsoft guns. Furthermore, every single person in the Zone is a better pitcher than anyone on any baseball team on earth. I mean, I have never been hit in the forehead with a grenade quite so often as I have been in in this game. I could cower behind a wall and say a prayer that I don't die and get hit with a grenade(Not the explosion, it literally bounces off my character) from half the combat platform away. Fast-Travel does exist, but it is quite literally the least convenient source of mobility since holding L2 to walk forward on a Playstation system. I believe I've made enough statements on how bad it may be there, but there are in fact positives. I am basing this review off my own personal experience, so certain aspects which may be good or bad for me may not be experienced by you personally. Now the start of the game is interesting enough, so long as you have a well enough understanding of the map and controls and how to utilize your PDA and the Artifact tracker. Seeing as I did not have a great understanding of these things, I went into the swamps and got half way to the second area of the game without completing the first two missions. So be warned, follow the yellow arrow and monitor the grey arrow as well. Now to the good aspects for realPros:+Vast area to explore; The Swamps are interesting to explore but only so long as you can avoid the anomalies.+Many different weapons and upgrades available+Random encounters with Mutants make this a horror experience as much as a shooter+Upgrades have weight to them, just as they have consequences +Buildings offer a lot of atmosphereCons:-Fast Travel can be the most expensive habit in the game-Most buildings have the most amazing atmosphere, but are too often empty of much worth exploring-Invisibility also means transparent/not able to be touched physically by weapons-T is for Tedium!-The ending sequence of the game is literally the best reason to Rage Quit-Game Breaking Bugs(Example: If you retrieve your gear before you go into Duty territory and talk to the commander, the option to talk to anyone is lost and the game can no longer be continued)-Pistols do not have iron sights but assault rifles do(Contrast to the older game, Shadow of Chernobyl)-Dude from Freedom Faction MAY TRY to sell you drugsOverall, it's not a great game. It's not a good game. It's barely within the respective zone for being an Okay game. I gave this game a legitimate try. I gave it serveral tries. As a matter of fact, on the last sequence of the game, I gave about sixty-four tries. However, if I were to count only the amount of times I restarted the campaign, it would be six. Three of those were due to glitches, three were due to Laptop changes and difficulty adjustments. My Final Rating for this game isA Red First-Aid Kit/10It's fine, but doesn't do much for you other than familiarize you with some controls and environments of the game, even if it isn't of a similar layout to the other games. It's good enough to hold you over until you can get the other two far superior versions of the game(Shadow of Chernobyl and Call of Pripyat). While it may quench your thirst for a Nuclear-Disaster based First-Person-Shooter, it is like comparing Resident Evil to the Resident Evil Remake; Only imagine that the Remake came out first. You can literally skip this installment.			"

												The game isn't terrible, but it's not great either. The game devs were quite cruel when making this game.-Possible Spoiler Alert-Pros:-Repair system. This was much needed, as equipment tends to degrade quickly, which can make the game unnecessarily difficult.-Upgrades. Feeling of progression with the ability to improve your weaopns and armor.Cons:The game devs were really cruel when making this game.-The beginning of the game is pretty dumb. The bandits have all of the advantages against you (better accuracy, can spray accurately, tank more bullets than you), and you're constantly in 1v8 situations with little to no cover.-A powerful sniper rifle (VSS Vintorez) is available at the very beginning of the game. However, it is unusable without paying a hefty repair cost, and the ammunition it uses cannot be obtained until late in the game, at which this sniper is readily available. In short, it's just dead weight.-There's a machine gun emplacement that guns you down while you run for your life. This is impossible on the hardest difficulty, and even on the easiest difficulty, the machine gun will probably warrant a somewhat expensive repair.-At one point in the game, bandits steal all of your money. Adds insult to injury.-Bandits are total ♥♥♥♥♥, but only they can help you install the best armor upgrades. -Not many side quests.-The is too linear. I found myself passing through each area exactly once with little reason to backtrack. Unlike the other STALKER games, there's no central hub(s) where one can settle down and relax.Overall, not recommended unless you're a hardcore STALKER fan that wants bragging rights for playing all the games.

												I loved the first STALKER game Shadow of Chernobyl, and I enjoyed Call of Pripyat, but this is a pain in the ♥♥♥.  The problem is primarily level design.  In the other two games you can handle big challenges your way.  Here, the last third of the game is a very lineral duneon crawl.  In some games that works, but when you have such a wide open first part of the game, the restrictions on the last third are painful.   Maybe there is a mod that helps?If you love the other two games then, fine, get this one, but prepare for frustrsation.  I should have left this one alone.			"

												Unlike SoC I'd say pass on this one.The enemies are pure bullet sponges. You can put half an AK clip into a guys head and he would still be standing. Standing out in the open shooting you with his sniper shotgun from about a hundred feet away. Difficulty setting will not help. All it does is make enemies more of a bullet sponges. Because of it the gunplay is just unenjoayble. I went to take a group of bandits. There were five of them. I had just over 600 bullets. My AK is always set on single shot so I can at least try to go for precision. By the end of the raid. I had about two dozen bullets left. Minus about 10 medkits because nearly every one of their shots was spot on.Friendly AI is even worse. Their pathfinding is horrific. You will constantly pushed out of cover, into anomalies, radioactive water. All they do is rush enemy head on to get killed so you will fail a mission.This pretty much ruined my game. I have tried using mods, but it seems none of the mods actually address those issues. None that I found, anyway.Skip this one and go straight for Call of Prypiat if you already have Shadow of Chernobyl. "

												Started playing it but after wandering around and constantly dying several times in the first proper area, I'm now moving onto other games. I'm guessing I am missing something obvious to players of the series, but I don't recall anything in the start of the game 'tutorial' explaining anything about how to avoid radiation and that's what seemingly kept killing me.It's very frustrating with no guidance in the initial stages of a game.I haven't played any other STALKER games and now probably won't.

												Stalker clear sky… A standalone addon to the Stalker game, which was very interesting from the side of new or fixed gameplay procedures and features, most noticeable from which are clan wars and system of weapon and gear upgrades. Also the feature with emissions where you in the middle of normal exploring all of sudden have to run fast to any shelter or die under not-so-clear-sky of the Zone. And new system of loot hunting, where you need special detector to find the Zone relics… And many other little things, most of them were invented and even implemented by the original game community.Being a hard fan, obsessed with the Stalker immerse world, I was able to made it through all Clear Sky quite fast, when it was just released. And I even felt the need to protect that title from blasphemous critics, who’s just not getting the point… But then I started the game for the second time, to really enjoy all its secrets and tight spots. And now I was puzzled with so many development decisions. Why they done it like this? Really, there should be some other way, there is no any logical base for this move. And that turn. And that was unnecessarily too… Now I feel only a shame for the developers, who ruined such interesting setting with totally unreasonable game plot. And, the worst thing is what all the bad stuff comes at player right away, just from the start! The first level in Swamps, after open wastes, forests and industrial compounds of the first game we need to follow the narrow passages... That's even worse than playing the second Crysis game right after the first one! A way worse. And after you manage through Swamps, the gameplot rushes you to go right on the army's outpost, with the outrageous machinegun (if you never played the game, just watch some vid's about ""Clear sky military machinegun"" on the youtube, there will be plenty). And if you managed to run out of that setup, you'll come into the Main Clear Sky Feature - the Clan Wars questline. Things finally starting to get interesting after Cordon... right until the moment you realise that all those clan wars are broken beyond repair. The major tip in the community about that quest line - don't do that!I can say the same about the whole Clear Sky in general. Unless you're a hardboiled Stalker veteran and going to download (or create) some mods for Clear Sky - don't even bother to start it, just get the Call of Pripyat instead, for much better experience.Me, I prefer the first STALKER game the most, even without mods. Even vanilla Shadow of Chernobyl gives you the biggest amount of adventure, and diversity of gaming experience. Both Clear Sky and Call of Pripyat are just two (of many) mods with the hope to improve some gameplay aspects. And Clear Sky is a lost hope. It done some good, but as a standalone game - it's a very frustrating experience, not worth of your time. Mark 5/10.			"

												While the first STALKER is old, it has it's charm. This must be renamed STALKER Clear ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t or Linear Scripting Hell. They re- use some areas of the old one, but that has it's charm. They've changed a lot and nothing for the better. For instance, bandages are highly needed now cause a medkit wont stop the bleeding...no bandage and you will die slowly. And then there is the case when you bandage yourself and you are still losing health, with no other clear indication why! Bandaging again or a medkit does not work. But wait there is more, enemies can see you from miles away, while you still struggling from where that head shot came from. After a while you find out that mr. freaking bandit almost killed you with a pistol from 200 yards away, while yours is inaffective anywhere but point-blank.While in the old stalker you could use an object to hide from incoming fire, in here hiding does not make sense, when they spot you, they will fire upon you and will hit you. And they will spot you, even crouching and walking pace(slowest movement almost no sound) they will spot you in daylight or in the night as if they all wear NV goggles. Yes they will spot you and shoot around freaking corners or through objects...but that's oke FF. Well hell no it's not, cause once you come out of the swamps, the militairy is waiting for you. They'll ask you to go back, one more step and you are fodder. But you need to go that way cause you can't go another way. You cannot sneak upon or away from them. You need to go to the trader on your left and the only way to do it, is by running, they will sent a squad of 3 with body armor and very accurate akms...and one thing an akm is not... Good, you've survived by running...but those 3 militairy dudes followed you and are killing the stalkers in the village(3 of them) and you are next.One last thing, I was irritated in the old stalker by a guy in pripyat, come here stalker, my information...yeah that guy. Now they turned every freaking talking ape in the zone like him. Stand too close and they will spam you the same question over and over again....Save your money, use it to make a trip to the real chernobyl instead...I bet ya ,kissing the sacrofaag there is more fun then this game.

												I won't say this is a bad sequel, but this game has been very frustrating to finish.Compared to the first, there are some new useful features like fast travel (but very, very limited) and weapon/armor repairing and modifying.There is also a faction war system, that is cool and seems like the main feature of this new chapter, but it is (and should be, to avoid problems in game) totally avoidable.The plot is very trivial, unbalance is very annoying in some parts and bugs can oblige you to start again from a very old save state.The unbalancing, in particular, happened just approaching the last part of the main story. I had a very poor equipment and I was waiting to meet a shop to get better, but for like 3 areas, along the way, I met not a single shopper, only guys that could only repair my equipment (not even enhance it).So at some point I found myself in a long way without turning back until the end of the game (with no previous warning) with these crappy weapons and armor, and the game turned in a constant ""loading and dying"".In the end, the game feel a lot like its predecessor (intending it in a bad way, overall it feels just like playing again the first), but with some additional highs and lows that, depending on the individual game experience, can turn it good or bad like hell.Unfortunately, for me it has been a very bad and frustrating experience.

												tl;dr Don't buy this because it's the cheapest stalker game. The original may cost twice as much, but with the Oblivion Lost mod, you can get the minimal added content from this game in the original. Clear Sky is simply SoC with a worse campaign, 3 extra maps, and a more annoying faction system. Simply patching the campaign/maps from this game into the original will provide a better game than this one.Faction Wars ruins the entire game.Having the military hate you wasn't enough, you'll constantly be met with stalkers who try to extort money from you, demand you defend their settlements which they make no attempt to defend themselves, and perma-agro if you walk the wrong places or refuse to allow them to extort you. Everyone wants you dead, and there's no ♥♥♥♥ing AK ammo anywhere. Pistols often jam twice in a row or on the first round of new magazines.			"

												By far the worst STALKER game of the trilogy. The bugs are gamebreaking, common and unavoidable. The optimization is cancer, and far worse than the other two. The map is ripped straight from shadow of chernobyl, with no changes, moreso removals of previous areas, and the storyline is so boring I had to watch gay porn to get a better narrative after refunding it.

												This is the first add-on to the Stalker series, but, besides faction wars, it doesn't really add something interesting. It doesn't matter which faction you choose, the end will remain the same. You could probably add some fun to it trying to outplay the factions, but that's about it. Also the end is very buggy.			"

												DO NOT BUY EVEN IF ON SALE!!!!!I'm a huge STALKER fan since the game came out. I played 1 and 3 but skipped this one a long time ago because I heard it was trash. It was on sale for dollars and decided to give it a try. Terrible idea. This isn't worth more than 2 dollars and even then, it's not worth your time. Rushed to hell and buggy as hell. Boring as well. The AI is one of the worst, though I don't make a habit of playing bad games, it's one of the worst I've seen in a long time. If you have a current machine and can turn draw distance to max they will be unable to really spot you. Even if they can, sometimes, their AI won't start and they'll just stand there while you spend 2 magazines from your AN-94 trying to hit them. I got to the third area and just uninstalled it. I kept playing it in hopes that it would get better, but it never did and realized it wouldn't. When you're QUESTS and AI are bugged, you have a huge problem. Even if they're not game-breaking. You still have a HUGE problem. Terrible game. If I had to give it a numerical score, 4.5/10. When compared to other STALKER games 3/10. Just don't waste you're time on this one. This coming from a big STALKER fan.			"

												I usually don't do reviews, but this game made me want to give it a shot.S.T.A.L.K.E.R.:Clear Sky is, in my opinion, the worst of the trilogy.Here's a few reasons why:-Movement feels sluggish, as if your character is running under water. It makes the exploration extremely unpleasant.-Bleed is broken. Fall 2 metres -> break legs -> use all bandages -> die from bleed-Aiming is impossible. Not only does crouching not help, but looking down sights does f**k all.-If you manage to hit somebody, you'd think a bullet to the knee would slow them down. Not here...-Story is stock material, characters and places not as interesting as in the other games.All in all, if you want a good post-apocalyptic shooter rpg, play the other installments of the series (preferably modded), or any of the Fallout series.10/10 best swamp walking simulator 2015.

												I loved Shadow of Chernobyl. It wasn't exactly as originally promised (the developers removed a handful of features), still, the game had a unique atmosphere that made it memorable. Then, not long after Clear Sky was released and everything I liked about SoC simply vanished.Clear Sky was an unnecessary sequel. The developer quickly made a sequel to cash in on a successful and famous game. They advertised it as a prequel story as the protagonist here follows the hero from the first game. But shouldn't you introduce new environments or areas in a sequel even if it is intended as a prequel story? You venture through the very same areas - even the map looks the same. At the beginning, you have a swamp-like are which is new, yes, but then you encounter the same places.The game uses the same engine but with DX10 features included. Still, you have a handful of bugs and the game can be very difficult at times - not only do you encounter respawning enemies but sometimes it is difficult to understand why it takes so many shots to finally eliminate someone.What happened to the super ending of the original game? Here, the final encounter in the centre of the zone seems rushed and non-creative. What happened to the different endings we had in SoC based on the gameplay-style we followed? Where are the new enemy types / gameplay elements / objects / weapons we expect from a sequel? Make no mistake: introducing new things is not a must but at least I would have expected to have the game rid of all the bugs it had in the original one.I remember the forest area being different. Instead of following the route next to it we finally ventured into it. It was dark and creepy and provided the necessary atmosphere. But this was the only thing in Clear Sky that I remember as good.You can pick this one up if you are a Stalker fan but I recommend downloading and installing the Complete Mod which rids the game of above-mentioned issues and introduces several new features.

												I have always loved the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series for a long time and i absolutely enjoyed Shadow of Chernobyl it was fun and challngeing and suspenseful but this little ""Abomination of all things holy"" is a misreble wreck BUT don't get me wrong it has its good parts and its heretical parts and on the good side i like the new sounds for the weapons, i like the new graphics thry are nice looking and show the true beauty of the Zone i certainly like the upgraded AI and the absolutely much needed Weapon and armor upgraded/repair which i loved its nice to upgrade a powerful gun to make it even more powerful but now here comes where i must truely explain why this game should not be botherd with..... Now the enemys in Shadow of Chernobyl could take some damage without soaking up to much ammunition but in this all your enemys from the basic Novice stalker to a Monolith Exo ARE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BULLET SPONGES to the point of you can go through magazines even with highly accurate/powerful assault rifles AND IT'S STUPID!, Also the ""Faction War"" thing is a waste of time, ammuntion and money for example, I always join the Loners since i have never liked the Bandits so everytime i face them i win but there is that time when i am about to destroy their base AND!, at the last momment i kill the last Bandit (Yoga) then..... the Loners lose the Recievieng Outpost and the  ""Garbage"" and i have to start over again also another thing when an outpost is underattack and im litteraly 1 seconds away from it i get this ""Task Failed: Lost Recieving Outpost"" and it makes me as angery as Russian man without Vodka to drink and a Klashnikov to shoot. So those are soeme of the reason why i suggest not getting this game Its rage enduesing, painful, annoying, tedious and most of all!, down right HERESY so if i could give this a rateing from 1-10 i would give it a 5/10 becase it has some good things but its simply in my thought a too difficult to play game even for Masters of the Zone.-Sorry for my spellign errors-Sorry for conventional errorsP.S- I am no newbie to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R games i have played a long time so don't consider this 5 minute rage and review.

												Wayne Campbell: Ah yes, it's a lot like ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". In many ways it's superior but will never be as recognised as the original.In many ways that quote holds true with Clear Sky when you compare it to Shadow of Chernobyl, but Clear Sky is riddled with a lot of bugs and half baked concepts that, on the surface seem to be great improvements, but in reality, are poorly implemented and in a lot of cases, are almost game breaking, if not so. I don't make this assessment lightly and it's with a heavy heart that I do so... From start to finish, I wanted to enjoy this game, but it just never threw me a bone! Right down to the last boss, that glitched out and began to walk upon air, 50 meters above ground and take cover behind non-existent crates.*It was a pleasure to gather artefacts in the manner stated in the encyclopaedia from Shadow of Chernobyl, however it was often times frustrating to find artefacts that now had new abilities, some of which did the complete opposite of their SoC counterparts. *The upgrade system was nice, but needed a lot more work and an explanation in game of how the upgrade trees work.*The bandits at the Garbage can go eat ♥♥♥♥! Avoid them like the plague! And if you're like me and save up lots of money... Don't! Twice these no good ♥♥♥♥ers bled me dry and with no way to get it back... not even through bloodshed!*Exploration... What can I say? Shadow of Chernobyl... You look around... Find a nice gun... Or a suit or armour... With Clear Sky however, it's high risk for low to no reward! I know it's only early days in the Zone but at least reward exploration! God damn Scrooges!*GLITCHES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Gotta love them! And 'them' there are many of... From the aforementioned floating final boss, to side quests the refuse to acknowledge the presence of the PDA in your inventory, to enemies that kill you in one hit if you happen to be in the air or jumping.*Faction wars... Actually the biggest problem here is your allies! Constantly pushing you out of cover and shooting you in the back, mindlessly trying to shoot an enemy! I lost count of the amount of times I was killed in the FW tutorial portion of the game... Shot in the back by a friendly shotgun! If you survive... You're expected to suck it up! ...And if you accidentally hit an idiot that walks in front of you, they get angry and gun you down... ♥♥♥♥ IT!(SIGHS) I know a lot of this sounds like nit picking, but hey! THIS IS THE GAME!!! This is the experience I had! ...And coming off of an enjoyable stint in the zone, in 'Shadow of Chernobyl', 'Clear Sky' was an utter disappointment and seemed more like a fart in an enclosed room than a clear blue sky of promise and in my opinion, will forever live in the 'Shadow of Chernobyl'... What? That didn't make sense? Get ♥♥♥♥ed!   XDDon't play this unless you're a die hard S.T.A.L.K.E.R, fan!			"

												As much as I love ""Shadow of Charnobyl"" and ""Call of Prypiat"" - this one sucks all the way !!! From the point of Limansk I had to force myself to even finish it. First of all - no matter how difficult you set the game - the difficulty level is absurd. Be prepeared to load last save countless times. But the worst of all - bugs, bugs and even more bugs. Enemy hits with the grenades ALWAYS, while you... well, I don't really remember hitting the spot even once (and I tried really many times). Above all - your granades DOES NOT WOUND the enemy at all. Adding that your enemies see you all the time (even when you are hiding), and can shoot trough walls, while your supposed ""friends"" simply push you out of the way (usually out of cover into direct firinig line or off the bridge). Oh, and almost all sub-quests fall into category ""go fetch something and bring it here"" - fun once or twice, but that's all.In other words, if you liked ""Shadow of Charnobyl"" and ""Call of Pripiat"" - DO NOT TRY THIS GAME !!!

												One of the most broken games available. Even if you've got a load of extra cash lying around, I wouldn't recommend buying this game. The game seems great at first with wide-open areas and decent visuals but it all goes downhill from there. It seems the vast majority of the game is plagued with radiation that keeps you from exploring it, and all other areas are loaded with bandits and military goons. The biggest problem with the game are the loads of human enemies that litter the world turning it into a standard spray and pray shoot-out, but with a special catch: every single enemy is a bullet sponge that can absorb clip after clip, the only saving grace being that sometimes a headshot will kill them instantly. Other problems rise from certain parts of the game being a pain to get to because of broken hit-boxes or dozens of 'anomalies' being in the way that make traversing slow and mind-numbing. The tutorials also don't explain a whole lot, the UI is mediocre, and secondary quests are a pain to deal with because of a bad map and the many environmental blockages that will get in your way. It would be enjoyable to wander the expansive wastes, but sadly every five steps you take runs you into an irradiated field or an anomaly that will explode into a cloud of lightning and send you flying. Overall, a terrible game with basically no redeeming qualities.			"

												Exploring the nuclear wasteland known as the ""Zone"" and delving into the heart of the Chernobyl reactor #4 to uncover artifacts and to discover the cause of the frequent radioactive emissions that go off more than ever before, all while battling the horrific mutated creatures caused by the second Chernobyl disaster and the bandits that want nothing but you dead and your stuff in their hands. It sounds like a lot of fun right? That is, until you actually play the game. The Optimization for this game is horrible, I can't even run it in directX 10 at a playable framerate (I can run BF4 on very high/ultra in a 64 player battle at 60+ FPS, as well as Planetside 2 with 200+ players). The NPCs are much too powerful (even on the easiest difficulty and I'm the type of person that always plays on the hardest difficulties), their grenades always seem to appear at your feet and their bullets always end up in your head. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a challenge in combat but these enemies seem impossible to beat. The game has many bugs and quite a few random lag spikes that can last for more than 10 seconds.However, the game is not all bad. The ambience is fantastic and it really sets the dark mood of the Zone. The story is actually well written and gripping. The location also makes this game amazing as it takes place in the Chernobyl disaster zone (which I love), it is the perfect place for a game like this and lastly, the landscape is beautiful (I find that the abandoned buildings that nature has taken back are beautiful, that's just my view).This game has more cons than pros causing me to not recommend this. Stalker Clear Sky was too advanced for its time and had many issues. I would give this game a 65/100 simply due to the reasons I have stated. If you are looking for a game that takes place in a nuclear wasteland that has mutants and bandits I would recommend the Fallout series.			"

												On paper it sounded like a great game, a survival/horror shooter with some RPG elements, but it is hopelessly poorly implemented.  It is so buggy and unbalanced it is nigh on unplayable without modding (I tried Complete, Sky Reclamation Project, and Arsenal Overhaul), and even then it is not really great.  If you are a mind-reader you might do better, as it also has next to no tutorial, leaving it to the player to divine how things work, and what you need to do to complete mission objectives is not always made clear, so you are left to blunder around and try to figure it out, all the while under a rain of death from the infallible bullet-sponge AI.  Prepare to die over and over while you do that, which is weird for a survival game, the point of which is surely to NOT die.  I gave up on this one, I was just not having fun.			"

												I didn't get passed the first mission. Dislike the fact the game gives you no info on how to play, when it would be really helpful, considering on the first mission there are random spots that if you so much as approche, you die. The game says to use an item to detect them but does not tell you what this item is called or anything about it. How am I supposed to play your game if you don't even tell how to navigate through the first mission? Even Dark Souls (a game that is, according to everybody I know, the most unfair game ever) shows you the controls and gives somewhat of an idea how to play, without holding your hand through the entire tutorial.Overall, this game blows. I'm done with shooters, I'm going back to Dark Souls.			"

												Prequel to Shadows of Chernobyl and mostly same mechanics if not all with more things for better & worst.The artifacts' stats are now simplified and all except a very select few give off radiation. Those select few remove radiation so most of these ones are rare to find. Artifacts and anomalies can also now be detected via detectors so long as you're close enough to said artifacts and as you progress you can buy more improved detectors.The guns are all pretty much like the ones in SoC, you'll be lucky to get a headshot with a beginning gun. Clear Sky added a new upgrade and repair system that specific NPCs can provide for you. Repair is simply just to restore the condition of your weapons and armor whereas upgrades can vastly improve the actual weapons and armor you're using from guns decreasing in weight, armor having more specific protection stats, etc. However specific NPCs won't know how to upgrade certain guns or certain parts unless you go to another NPC or acquire a flash drive of the data for better improving equipment that that specific NPC can work with.Fast travel is now a thing where you can pay guides to take you to specific places of every explorable map. Prices vary on how far you're going.Clear Sky's got a new faction war system where a group from a specific faction can start to go to another faction's territory and try to take its place and if somehow you're friends with both sides you can help whichever side or let them go at it until one side loses so as you don't take a side. Unfortunately important characters can die from this so getting specific tasks may become impossible.One of the most irritating things about this game are the random emissions that can immediately kill you if you don't go inside an indicated shelter within the time limit. If you're the type who likes to loot and sell a lot of junk these can be a pain in the fanny for if you're too far from a shelter and you have a wide load you may have to sacrifice said loot just so you can get to the shelter in time. The emissions also take forever to actually happen (like, 1 or 2 minutes I didn't really check when it starts) so even if you're conveniently next to shelter you'll have to just sit inside and wait for the emission to end before going back to your usual S.T.A.L.K.E.R. ways.The spook factor, I thought, was gone and especially so since you don't really explore any labs. Going through the Red Forest though was cool at night but it wasn't really anything special, especially when dealing with annoying Bloodsuckers. It plays like Shadows of Chernobyl but much of what made the first game cool seemed to be gone and as a fan of the first game this was pretty disappointing. Even the two endings here weren't really interesting and you can probably skip this and just move on to Call of Pripyat. "

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky starts off with a terrible first impression. The main menu not only looks almost exactly like the first game's, but even the main menu music is the same. This isn't necessarily bad, but it's like a sick foreshadowing to the travesty that is this game.GRAPHICSVisually, this game is fairly good. However, it's nothing impressive. The first game allowed great immersion, even if you were only playing at the medium graphical settings. This game, however, fails to draw you into the setting, and I just groaned in contempt when I reached the end, where even the legendary and infamous Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant failed to stimulate my visual senses.GAMEPLAYThe game in terms of gameplay is definitely superior to the first entry. With more accurate weaponry and less shooting-through-walls glitches, I found myself not getting nearly as infuriated with the game as I did with the first. However, the survival/horror was absent entirely. The mutants were nearly nonexistent, whereas in the first game I was constantly on edge with the terror of the fantastic and varied enemies. But in this game, I found myself bored with fighting too many human enemies. Still, the mechanics are far superior than the first game, and I can give this props for that.MULTIPLAYERDon't play this mode. Please, for the love of all that is good and sane in this world, NEVER PLAY THIS MODE. Weapon balance is nearly nonexistent, maps and game modes are recycled from the first game. On top of that, you'll be hard pressed to find anyone playing this game's multiplayer. Stay clear of it.STORYThe game's story takes a massive hit. It is nothing more than a pale shadow in comparison to Shadow of Chernobyl. This game takes place one year before the events of the first game and tells the story of the zone and how Strelok came to be where he was in the first game. Sounds great on paper, but is overall disappointing. The game says multiple times that there are new areas to explore in the game because emissions have changed the radiation levels around the zone. This is complete and utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T. There are a total of two new places to explore in the game. Otherwise, you visit literally EVERY SINGLE LOCATION FROM THE FIRST GAME. Actually, even less than that! The fact that I completed this game's story, while completing a few of the dull, uninspiring optional missions along the way, in a whopping 6 hours, proves that the developers were simply lazy with the game. You will shoot hundreds of humans all around the same places you've been to in the first game, and then sometimes shoot a mutant, repeat. Strelok is barely in the game at all, very little of the first game's supposed background history is given in this game, and it fails to inspire and enthrall like the first game. There was no mystery, horror, or intrigue throughout the course of this painfully short campaign, and it felt like a chore to go through.VERDICTThis game is $10 U.S. dollars not worth spending. This was a money-grabber after the success that was S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl. There was so much potential in this game that was simply wasted, and I was painfully reminded throughout the course of the game that I wasted money on a game that I will probably never play again. Make no mistake, this is one of the worst video games that I have ever played, a copy-and-paste of the original with less content and a worthless story. RATING: 5/10			"

												I wanted to like this game as I had played the first STALKER game, however I found it has too many faults (and the first had it's fair share).1. Re-spawn bugs: NPCs that you just shot dead, and an area is clear, they look like they leap back from the dead or magically appear in front of you - making it impossible to take a base as your team NPCs never arrive, they seem to go wandering off in the wilderness.2. Persistence bugs and fails: leave an area and immediately return, and all the ground you gained has disappeared with your NPC bases taken back instantly (clock showing only minutes difference).3. Later in the game with improved weapons and armour, it seems that the low level weapons some NPCs have become more powerful than your own - such that a shotgun can take you out at 100+ metres. Whilst the fully upgraded sniper rifle won't even take an NPC out with a headshot, often requiring a full clip of 10+ shots to kill a NPC.4. None existent game levelling, comparing all game play levels and there was little to no difference between Novice to Veteran.5. Missions that appear and disappear within seconds, not even allowing you time to run to them even when only a few metres away.I have played many FPS, 3PS and RPG games for over a decade, always at highest difficulty. I am a fan of the series of Fallout, Crysis, CoD, Battlefield, Far Cry, Skyrim, Dragonage, Mass Effect etc etc. But this one unfortunately is not going in that list, like I said I really did want to like it, but the above eventually wore me down, I don't want to finish it... so I really can't recommend it - follwing this review it's being uninstalled.

												The game is not as good as Shadow of Chernobyl, but still enjoyable. However, there are several issues in the game that makes the gameplay experience frustrating, like linear gameplay, lack of decent side quests, lack of mutant combat, boring maps (swamps), too much walking without action, the RPG feel is too light, the ""emissons"" are lame, just take gameplay time making you wait. The campaing goes too fast, whan I saw, I was at the last chapter of the game, and I never got better armors and night vision (even playing for 45 hours).The plot is lame, the ending frustrated me so much that I couldn't believe.And... there are the bugs, they ruin much of the enjoyability, like broken side quests, broken triggers of quests ongoing, and the worst: when I was at the final quest, there was 2 missions: destroy Strelok's psionic protector, and get to the sarcophagus, but I never had to get to the sarcophagus, and Strelok bugged standing still while I was shooting a him, winnign the game.The game is fun, is enjoyable, but I can't give a good review. 4/10.

												A lot of what made STALKER great is still in there (inspiration from the Tarkovsky film, 'realistic' combat in a weird post-nuclear Chernobyl setting), but the factions system is an afterthought and your character is caught in a poverty trap unless you mine for artifacts constantly. Also the game ate my quicksave somewhere in Limansk and I wasn't bothered to find out where the hell it went to. So in summary: Read Roadside Picnic and watch the STALKER film if you want some sort of prequel.			"

												Look the STALKER games are fantastic; the combats brutal, the worlds are immersive and the atmosphere is brilliant. However I simply couldnt get this game to run for long enough to finish a playthrough so I cant in all honesty recommend Clear Sky. This doesnt mean you wont have more luck than me getting the game to run but personally I would recommend playing Call of Pripyat instead which I found to be far more stable.If you can get this game to run well then I'm confident you'll enjoy it but dont be surprised by consistent crashing.

												The gameplay is just like the other two stalkers, walk around and shoot bad guys with guns that have random innate inaccuracy, hope you don't get randomly bombarded with grenades, and repeat.The game finds you running around performing mundane tasks to no avail, the endgame is literally just a two minute mission where you shoot a bad guy from far away with a gun they hand to you and it's over just like that, no endgame roaming, no redeeming qualities, just -over-.Literally not worth anyone's time, there is no point to playing this game.

												A so-so prequel to Shadow of Chernobyl that re-uses most of the SoC assets to flesh out the original story. Plays a lot better when you ignore the main 'quest' and go wandering. The new faction wars feature would have been the saving grace of the title if it wasn't quite so buggy and had a touch more depth to it.It's nice to wrap yourself in the Stalker atmosphere again but overall the game feels too much like a simple (and flawed) expansion rather than a stand-alone game.

												I'm a big STALKER fan and one of my friends, who is a much larger fan of everything related to the series, told me to stay away from Clear Sky. I figured that even something vaguely Stalkery would be still pretty good because Pripyrat and the original were very enjoyable, but I after playing through Clear Sky I see why people say stay away. 1. Very short 2. Very linear with exploration discouraged 3. Less focus on monsters/mutants and more on killing hundreds of human enemies4. Ending is terrible5. You have very few, if any, choices beyond which faction to fight for6. Faction Wars idea feels like it is barely fleshed out 7. Upgrade system and a few other things tied to the factions are not fun8. Little sense of what either of the other two Stalkers are all about (weird ♥♥♥♥, exploration, mutants and being a Stalker)9. Only one ending as far as I can tell10. Several repetitive sections were you just kill waves after waves of human enemiesLet me explain some of those a little more. The game is a bit short, especially comapred to the other two. My record says 20 hours, but 3-4 hours of that are idle-time when I left it on and the rest was doing absolutely everything I could in terms of side missons/faction wars and trying to explore areas that didn't want to explored. I imagine you could easily run though it (without trying hard) in less than 10 hours. The entire feeling of world is almost erased from what was created in the original game (and Pripyrat even though that came after this one). You can only find things if they are randomly located by this guy back at the original base that randomly gives you locations of stashes, or if you buy tips from people for stashes. If you happen to find that stash on your own without doing either of those things then nothing will be in it, hence discouraging exploration. A lot of the areas are also pretty closed off or empty besides human enemies, which kind of give tiers of loot depending on where you are in the games story. All of this might be fine if the story was good, it isn't because it goes against the original's story and just kind of sucks all around, or if the Faction War system was actually good. The Faction War system, which is a big focus of the game and one of the main things going on all the time (also one of the main reasons there is less focus on mutants and exploration) is a really shallow offering. You have no real impact on anything and only if you get a mission to take an area will the A.I. faction you are fighting for actually go and capture it. They give you a lot of good rewards for doing missions and taking over areas, but it is all very temporary and the whole system isn't the slightest bit dynamic. The A.I. rarely does anything on their own, they have no ambition, and even when you do the ""big mission"" that is supposed to supress an enemy faction the area is only captured for 15 minutes at most. You cannot command any squads, request reinforcements if you take somewhere on your own, or really interact with your faction at all beyond their main bases, which just offer shops. It was very disappointing to experience because it could have been something much more complex, dynamic and enjoyable. Somewhere in all of this is an actual STALKER game with great environments, horrifying enemies, a great upgrade system and so much more, but I whole heartedly recommend playing Pripyrat instead even if you have already beaten it before and you are just looking for another go at this wonderful world.

												Highly disappointed with the final game prequel after playing the other two S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games.  This one is glitchy and they removed tons of stuff.  I can't believe there's no aim-down-sight for a pistol any more.  No I'm not modding to fix what they shouldn't have changed from the last one.Pretty much got sick of the factions whining at me to help take back points and they'd lose them over and over.  So I ended up skipping almost all the side missions(which were mostly fetch missions with no value) and only played the very predictable(because it's a prequel) main quest.Way to ruin a good series.

 Originally posted on June 3, 2009 I loved STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl. It wasn't perfect, but it was a really exciting game. However, after playing STALKER: Clear Sky for over 25 hours, I am unable to continue. The game is broken. Allow me to explain.Graphically speaking, Clear Sky is a huge step up from SOC. It uses some of the most advanced shadows I've seen in a game, and the day and night cycle is incredibly immersive. All of the haunting art design and character modeling for the first game is there, but with improved models. However, the game is also so poorly optimized that it cannot run DirectX11 shadows without becoming a slide show, and continues to give me burst of awful (5-10 fps) lag on my rig. And trust me, my rig is not the problem. I've confirmed that this problem is widespread among many gamers, and is not just isolated to me.The sound in the game is exceptional, of course. Weather, ambient noise, howls, fire crackling, gunshots, etc, all really help to immerse you in the zone. I have no complaint's about the sound design.If the lag was the only issue, I would probably have finished this game lag and all. I certainly tried to. Of course I saw where it was headed, but the thrill *spoiler* of putting Strelok in the place we find him in SOC drove me onward. *spoiler* However, the combat mechanics, which were really great in the first game, especially the gunplay, are broken in this game.Yes, the AI is more intelligent than in SOC; it uses cover, flanks you, and throws grenades. However, enemies tend to throw grenades in bursts at your EXACT position, and STALKER is NOT a movement friendly game. It feels incredibly unbalanced as one grenade will hurt you even if you sprint away from it immediately, and you will lose your cover. Multiple grenades almost always mean death.The ballistics model in this game is a big disappointment in comparison to the first. All types of guns are WILDLY inaccurate at ranges above 50 feet, unless they are absolutely tricked out with accuracy upgrades. With a standard AK 74 or Abakan, you can't hit a damn thing at 100m, and are almost always forced to use assault rifles as if they were SMGs (grenade spamming and charging in headlong). I had to spend a good 15000 rubles on my TRS 301 just to get it to perform like it did un-modded in the original game. The AI, of course has none of these accuracy issues, and can happily hit you at 100m plus with any gun in the game, including the MAKAROV!While the faction wars system is interesting, it's makes the zone feel too crowded, and not nearly as spooky or desolate as in the first game. In addition, whenever you conquer new territory, it takes the AI forever to send backup, which usually consists of 1-3 men to help you fend off the multiple counterattacks the enemy sends, usually consisting of 10 plus total men. You may have total numerical superiority, but if 300 of your best equipped stalkers are sitting in your base territory, you have a problem. This is supposed to be a war, not a one man take down border skirmish.In conclusion, I'm not wild about the new weapon upgrade system, but I could see it working in a future title, and i love being able to repair my gear, finally. The new detector and revamped anomaly system is good, and the new graphics and AI are great for the most part. Now fix the balance, lag, gameplay issues, performance, and bring back the spookiness, and cut out the generic side quests, and we'll have a great game.Here's to Call of Pripyat..... *sigh*			"

												I love the graphics and atmosphere. It puts you in a surreal mood.Put gameplay wise im shocked, i just can't believe how many rounds it takes to kill an enemy. After the first section of the game you encounter enemies who can take 40 assault rifle rounds to the chest and still live. But don't worry.. you still die in two shots. For a game with such a mature and gritty atmosphere i was super surprised to see how poor and unrealistic the combat was. Also the weapon models don't fit the gritty atmoshere, the shotguns look shiny and round. Its hard to describe but i just think the weapon models look bad.			"

I believe this game was made by a bunch of sick ill sadistic people who barely know the basics of creating video games and entertainment. Top it all with the fact that there aren't much mods around to make this ""game"" into an enjoyable one. All in all, it was on sales, I wanted to get a new game...Bad decision			"

												Meh. Buggy, bland world, uninteresting npc's and quests, half the guns  jam every other clip and like to shoot around people but never at them, you're sprinting back across the map most of the time to turn in a quest you finished an hour ago for a sub-par reward, and it has a *ridiculous* difficulty setting that eventually ruins the game outright (ridiculous because there is a function in the game programming that makes your bullets have a 40%-70% chance to literally disappear out of the air depending on what difficulty you chose). Later in the game, this will make it appear as tho one enemy is eating 2 entire clips right in their face before going down. Game's definitely fun if you like looking at a loading screens - the quicksave and quickload keys are the only useful things in your arsenal the whole time. Overall, just feels like a lot of areas in the game didn't get the attention or time they sorely needed. Don't spend your money on this without doing some in-depth review hunting first. In my opinion, there are plenty of other much better options for the $10 - $20 price range: any Fallout, Far Cry, Borderlands, Deus Ex games - heck, I could go on, and that's just others I've played recently. Play those games if you want a better rpg-shooter hybrid, not STALKER Clear Sky.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R Clear Sky is the follow up to the sleeper hit Shadow of Chernobyl, a game that somehow managed to overcome it's many flaws and limitations and be a great game. Clear Sky brings along many new additions and upgrades, particularly in the graphics department. And while all of this sounds great on paper the only thing it manges to accomplish is driving home the point that there are no good or bad ideas, only good and bad executions.The core gameplay remains the same, you are a ""Stalker"", a traveler in the cordoned off wasteland that surrounds Chernobyl. An area filled with radiation, mutated monsters and dangerous anomalies. Not to mention the rather high population of other stalkers and residents of ""The Zone"" that are also collecting the rare artifacts spawned by the anomalies and the various factions that each try to impose their own ideals on the zone and it's inhabitants.The faction system is one of the major new features of Clear Sky. They will send off groups of stalkers on their own attempting to secure various points of importance throughout the game world and if you are allied with them you will often be asked to participate in various offensive and defensive actions as mini-missions. This makes the world seem much more alive and as there are not only constant movement around the maps but it's also directed movement, everybody trying to gain the upper hand.The second big addition is the increased character customization. Your weapons and armor have many options that allow you to increase their potential in various ways. Many of the upgrades are exclusive as well so instead of making a super gun you have to specialize your weapons and armor. The developers have listened to the community as well and another part of this is the increased rarity of artifacts and the increased difficulty in collection them which is a very welcome addition.The unfortunate truth however is that both these additions come in a heavily flawed state and especially the faction system will lead to many hours of frustration. The game still has that ""raw"" feeling, despite the improved graphics, and where in Shadow of Chernobyl this was mostly forgivable the increased problems with Clear Sky makes it come out at you much more.Clear Sky is a unfortunate sequel that hasn't quite grown enough since Shadow of Chernobyl. It still has all of the problems that Shadow of Chernobyl and adds several of it's own which leads to a sequel that is less than it's predecessor.			"
