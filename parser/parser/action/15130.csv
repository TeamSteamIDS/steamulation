												Beyond Good and Evil is one of the most beautiful, amazing and original games the humanity has ever seen. (I really like it)Thanks to it's particular and charming design the game has aged like fine wine(*). While it was released in 2003 it has nothing to envy to current indies or more ""aesthetic"" games. It drives one of the most amazing an beautifully written stories I've ever seen, it's an amazing and original open world adventure game that will keep you hooked for many hours.*While the games is amazing, the port is old and it's engine doesn't play too well in post Windows XP machines without some tweaking. Gladly, we can fix that, when you launch the game, you will be presented with a Settings window (you can find the settings executable in your Steam libradry folder \steamapps\common\Beyond Good and Evil\SettingsApplication.exe), go to Advance Settings and in the Compability menu check ""Manual Compatibily Settings"" so you can manage the rest of the settings and uncheck the following options: Triple-buffering HW Vertex Processing Multi vertex stream W BufferIf you are still having issues, check the PC Gaming Wiki page for Beyond Good and Evil[pcgamingwiki.com] or some of the  Steam Community Guides or Discussions about the game "

												The good: -The art direction and diverse cast of characters-Photojournalism is the main weapon of your protagonist, and seeing it used as a concept in a fantasy setting is really refreshing-The protagonists. Without spoiling anything, Jade and Pey'j are a memorable duo, heartwarming characters in general, and there's still plenty of mystery surrounding them. Jade and Double H were a fun team as well, and there seems to be a lot of untold depth to even the minor characters, namely anyone found in the Akuda Bar-The soundtrack The bad:-The camera is sometimes wonky, especially on the PC-It's kind of an extension of the camera problem, but controlling the game's two vehicles can be frustrating in some parts-A little short, could have been one level/mission longer imo, but that's because I really enjoyed what I gotThe ugly: -The fact that this game was a commercial failure, isn't well known even to this day, and its sequel has been in development hell but is well deserving of existing alreadyConclusion: Play this game. It's charming, unique, and refreshing despite being over a decade old.			"

												So here's this game I played several times on the PS2, and it is SO FUN. PC is no exception.People may have seen the camera on the box art back in the day and said to themselves ""Ew! Camera in the gameplay, no way!"" Sure the camera is sometimes a necessary part of the game, but combat and stealth are major gameplay elements that shouldn't be overlooked.The story centres on Jade and Pey'j, in a strange world where half-animal people walk around on two legs and talk. For example Pey'j has a definite boar-like appearance. The world is under siege from the Domz armada, and the Alpha Sections are there to stop them. During an attack Jade discovers she's out of credits and her lighthouse shield power is cut off. In an effort to make some credits she takes on a photography job for the local science centre, and through a turn of events ends up working for a secret underground movement called the Iris Network.The plot is fairly straightforward - you go on missions looking for evidence, once you find the evidence you take photos of it, and then you get the hell outta there. The missions are few and large, and the best way to approach it is to go sneaky stealth mode on everything. It is possible to attack your enemies too, but you will have a hard time.Gameplay combat is all 3rd-person, but not all of it is melee. There are battles on the water inside your 'tugboat', and towards the end of the game there is even a spaceship battle, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Enemies hit hard in melee combat though, so it pays to grab all the health upgrades you can find. These can be manually distributed to your companion too if you think they need it. As already mentioned, subterfuge is your friend - you will have more fun with sneak attacks and trickery than trying to face-tank your way though the game.Other gameplay elements include speed-races to get your stolen credits back, minigames (that game in the Akuda Bar is badass hard), finding all the species to photograph for more credits, finding all the pearls for more vehicle upgrades. There are a couple of foot-chases too, to add whipped cream to an already delicious cake of a game.So how delicious is it? Well the music is a blast for starters. It has a wonderful style to it, melodious and alien. Well-suited to the game. The graphics are a little bland but good - with a main character like Jade it makes sense there's a bit of a green theme to it. Voice-actors have been cast well, there is a lot of great voice-acting in the game and it helps to suspend disbelief, helping immersion and reinforcing our empathy towards the characters.Highly recommended to anyone that loves stealth, a great story, or just wants to try something new. The hours I've played it on PC are not representative of my total hours (PC and PS2). Worth it just for the soundtrack!			"

												One of the classics games of the 2000s. Implements portions of stealth, platforming, action, and racing. It also includes a nifty element of taking pictures of different species of wild life to earn money. You(Jade) will have help of a companion for the most of game to help you in situations from puzzle solving, and fighting. Has a really interesting plot that involves around a conspiracy! You(Jade) suspect that the local military is working with an invading alien race the DomZ of kidnapping the local Hillyis population, and you need proof to unravel this conspiracy and get the doubting remaining population of Hilliyis to believe you and put a stop to it.

												Amazing game but I can't recommend it because ubisoft didn't bother to patch the game and just slapped whatever version they had on steam for some easy money.It aged teribly and it's hard to get the game run properly in 2016 on windows 10. I've been trying to fix it for the last couple days but nothing seems to work. I eather get terible framerate(1-10fps constantly) or terible graphical artifacts that make the game unplayable. Don't buy it unless you have an old rig.It's a god damn shame that amazing games like this one have such terible publishers that don't give a single ♥♥♥♥ about anything but how to make money for the least effort.UPDATE: 1 week and 3 operating systems later I made it work. I wanted to play this game so bad I got my old HDD, installed windows xp on it but had issues with sound. Finally it works properly on windows 7. So now everytime I want to play this game I have to reboot my pc go into BIOS to switch HDD priority and run the windows 7 one... For such an epic game I honestly don't mind but cmon... It's 2016 (almost 2017) and this game is on steam...			"

												Hands down one of the best Action-Adventure game ive played to this date, I loved the charecters and story and this review will tell you why I personally enjoyed each aspect of the game. (Ubisoft release BGaE 2 Please!) Before you question that I don't have the hours played on this game I have played the ps2 version and the HD remastered verson on the Xbox 360 and completed it on each platform. What does the game offer in terms of what genre it is The game is an Action/Adventure game with elements of Stealth and puzzle solving. The game doesnt throw you into battles all the time and most battles you can avoid by running away. The stealth in this game is almost completely optional unless theres a drone in the room, this drone only targets intruders when spotted and will instantly kill you which enforces you to be stealthy. There are puzzles to solve and most of them are easy to do like for example you have to redirect light beams to go to a certain area to access the next area. StoryWarning: This story is not set on the planet Earth, its a factional planet called HillysWhen i first started playing I didn't know what to expect when i first played but the story grabbed me about how the population was threatened by aliens called the Domz and how they attack every so often. When you first get to play you are thrown into combat stright away and the game doesn't hold your hand when it comes to showing combat, it shows a small text at the bottom showing what you press to attack but thats it, the enemy won't wait. As you play through the game you realise that the so called protectors are your enemy and the rebel organisation is actually the good guys. There is 3 dungon like places you go into to sneak around gathering infomation about what they are actually doing and exposeing them for what they do. I could go into more detail about the story but I don't want to spoil the story MusicEDIT: I almost forgot about the music, ill tag it hereThe music in the game is one of the best composed soundtrack. Each track suits the time it is played, an example when the main character gets depressed and the soundtrack suits it as they use viloin as well as low notes to express the feelings. There are other times but its worth to play a demo of this game or to play the game to get the full feeling for the game. CharectersThere is One main character that you control called Jade, she is the reporter and also an animal documenter (as thats a main way of obtaining units which is the currency of the game) and she looks after the orphans of Hillys and she has to leave them to do her missions which sets up the plot of the game. She has two companions throughout the game.The first one, Pey'j is her uncle who helps looking after the orphans and is also a mechanic. He doesnt stay for long as he is captured at the factory when you are finding out about what the alpha sections are doing. Pey'j has a special ability which allows him to slam onto the ground which throws up enemys to allow you to attack them and use them as projectiles. After the main plot is developed Pey'j gets a field ability where he can cut through metal fences which allows you to access areas or to get further through the main story.When you save Double H at the factory he joins you as the other companion throughout the rest of the game and he helps you through the remainder of the game.  Double H has a specal abilty where he uses his hammer to throw up enemys just like Pey'j but he has a field abilty where he will charge head first (helmet equipped of course) to knock down metal barred doors. What was the final boss likeObviously with a title like this i shouldn't need to tell you that there will be spoliers but i'll put it here anyway.SPOLIER ALERTSPOLIER ALERTI have warned you. Don't complain if I spoil too much. The final boss was unique as it had you thinking on your feet as you attack, he steals your uncle which leaves you with yourself and Double H, after killing the clones of your uncle Double H is taken as well and you have to fight the clones of Double H by your self and the clones keep telling you that you should give up, which isn't a option. Adventually you will be weakened as the boss says and will reverse your directional controls regardless of your settings, you can not go into the settings and change them because the game will keep them reversed, im not sure if you can go into the game with reversed directional controls and for it to be flipped. This is unique as i havent seen any other final boss do this. If your a controller user (from the ps2 or xbox 360/PS3 games) you could flip the controller itself making it slightly easier. I will not spoil how the game ends, ill leave that to you Was there anything i didn't like?There wasn't much I didn't like. I loved each part of the game. I guess that the most difficult parts would be when you had a drone in the room forceing stealth as it was in a difficult room where the guards are placed in difficult spots to get pass, for example placed at the doorway you need to get out at.Do I recommend this gameDefently as it will give you hours of fun as the main game lasts for about 7 to 8 hours without getting all the collectables, if your a completionist then it would take about 11 to 14 hours tops to get everything.

												I don't think I'll ever find a game that is better than Beyond Good and Evil.I have finished it about 6 times over 10 years, I have explored every corner of it and I can't find words to tell how much I love it.Some people say that it's not that great, because it's old or because it has simple/ripped-off mechanics, but those people don't understand what is this game about.It's more than just another adventure/stealth game. It's a gateway to a beautiful, living, unique world.There are many games with better graphics or mechanics, but this game has a soul and there are very few games in the world that have that.I recommend buying this game right now.Ignore those few negative reviews, don't watch the trailer, don't read the description, don't look at screenshots, just get it and play.There's a huge chance that you will fall in love with this game forever.And it's a chance worth taking.PS.:

Story:Year 2435 on the planet Hillys.After an attack by the Domz, Jade - the protagonist - got involved into an underground network which wants to find out the truth about the alien invaders.It's up to you now to investigate the connection between the attacking Domz and the defending army called 'Alpha Section'.As I don't want to spoil any content:Touching story! I'm sure you will enjoy it.Gameplay:While running, driving, sneaking and even flying a space ship, you have to take pictures of creatures or your targets of evidence and fighting the enemies who will show you that visitors are not welcome.my opinion:The mixed game style of sneaking and taking pictures as evidence on the one hand and fighting against the Domz on the other is not for everyone but after ten years this is stil one of the best stories in a video game I've ever played. It is just amazing!It's really a shame that this game did never recieve the attention it deserves.Definetly worth every cent - not to mention that it's on 75% sale quiet often.other words I wanna share:The default keyboard settings are kinda mixed up. - 'E': Jump  - 'Space': CameraIt kinda reminds me of The elder Scrolls III Morrowind - It had the exact same weird switched bindings (Space was 'use' there).Just Switch the two buttons and enjoy :)			"

 Gameplay Beyond good and evil is a openworld rpg.The combat is quite simple you have 1 attack button ( and upgrades later on ) and a dodge button.Overtime you get upgrades like gloves that shoot things.And heres comes my favorite bit the camera you take pictures of creatures/npcs to gain money and pearls.Pearls are used for upgrades for your vehicles you gain em by doing races, exploring, making enough photos, and lastly bosses.You have activities like racing just cave with creatures and pearls etc.You travel through the world with your boat and aircraft(which you get pretty late)The ship controls are pretty good and the combat is also solid, But then theres the aircraft controls which arent as good i suggest you just hold space while using the mouse.You have followers if they die game over, oh and they do special attacks.And as last you have stealth guard have 3 modes : the they havent seen you yet mode( green), The they heard you or saw you a lil bit (pink?), and the theyve seen you hide or kill em now( red).Most stealth rooms i just killed the guards they all mostly have a weak spot at theyre backs, but some rooms you have to stealth or youll get instakilled.The bosses are pretty easy once you find out what to hit or with what to hit the bosses.The last boss however can stunlock you and it inverts your controls,  i just gave up on the boss because i couldnt do it. Story I really dont want to spoil anything but ill just tell about some of the characters.You play as jade and you have peyj as your companion. i really cared abut the characters.Then you have the alpha somethings theyre here to save the hillyans and then there are the domz which are the evil aliens.The story is really well paced and you really have some feels moments in it. Audio and graphics The soundtrack is amazing it does the creepy music right the intense music/action music really gives you a boost.The graphics havent aged that well but the creature designs are great, the npcs are either just normal humans or just humans crossed with animals,The other creatures looks also quite reminiscent of various animals.The town looks futuristic.Oh and if you have the flickery graphics bug go to yer setting launcher and turn off hw something processing.The camera sometimes has siezures but its ok somtimes ihad to fight with the damn thing. Final verdict Amzazing soundtrack story which you care about the characters, pretty basic combat,stealth which mostly just works but you can combat out of most rooms.Dated but good artstyle/npc’s.But a bad last boss.And a refreshing camera mechanic.No drama, Just Reviews.

												This game is absolutely magnificent. It's a puzzle-adventurer, very akin to The Legend of Zelda. A lot of the mechanics revolve around sneaking and not being detected. You take the role of a girl named Jade, living on a planet that's beginning to be overrun with aliens. She is hired as a reporter for a rogue organization to spy on the government, as many people think the government and the aliens are in cahoots. There are moments that'll make you cry and leave you on-edge. Jade is a great protagonist, and you'll come to love every character. The graphics are a little dated (the game was originally on PS2, GCN and Xbox, so the resolution is pretty bad and there are quite a few graphical glitches.) The game makes up for this though, with amazing soundtrack, great story and thrilling gameplay. You'll definitely feel like a spy playing this game!I give this game a 9/10 (if it weren't for graphical glitches and sometimes monotonous battle system, it'd definitely get a 10/10)			"

Short version: 92%Beyond Good & Evil mixes many gameplay elements to create a fun, adventurous, yet surprisingly serious storyline about the struggles of a reporter who slowly uncovers the sinister plot against her home planet. Although it gained some recognition in the past five years, this game is still one of the most underappreciated sparkling gems of this century.Long version:Beyond Good & Evil was praised by both the press and players alike, yet it is still a perpetual resident on any list that collects the best rarely known games from the past 10-15 years or so. At first glance, these ratings are difficult to justify – after all, the game is a strange hodgepodge of various genres: puzzle, platformer, stealth, 3D brawler, treasure hunt, with some driving and racing on top.While these mixed-genre games rarely work, somehow the designers managed to keep all of these elements together in a tight knot. After getting used to the controls (a controller helps), we find a game with great mechanics, astonishing levels of large variety, and a small world that constantly offers some activity between the platforming stages, but not in a distracting manner.The final selling point is the story: we follow the adventures of Jade, a reporter and caretaker of some recently orphaned children. She gradually gets entangled in the war between her home planet and the invading aliens, only to discover the sinister truth behind the attacks, the recent kidnappings, and her own past.Despite the serious nature of the story, both the aesthetics and the writing tries to be light-hearted and fun, giving a great sense of adventure even when you are discussing battle plans in the back room of a bar. The cast does a wonderful job of delivering some memorable lines, elevating Beyond Good & Evil into a classic status, recommended for anyone who never had the pleasure of playing it.			"

												This was one of my favorite games on the X-box (if not my favorite), and is currently still my top 3 of best games all time. It's just one of those golden oldies where the story, the feel and the gameplay are more important than having the latest shiney graphics (but boring repetative gameplay and zero depth). I bought this to relive the adventure (and to kill time waiting for part 2 ;)), and for the current price on sale I can only recommend everyone to do the same.You take on the role of reporter Jade and her trusted pig buddy Pey'J, who must fight to uncover a conspiracy of global proportions taking place on their homeplanet Hyllis. The game sports RPG-like elements, since Jade has equipement that can be upgraded by collecting a special currency, blue pearls, which are collected by defeating enemies and minigames. Although the storyline is linear, (parts of) the world can be roamed freely in between missions, giving a great sense of freedom. Most of the characters you encounter while roaming are likeable and often funny. All-in-all the game is strong all-round, offering excelling storytelling and gameplay, and fitting graphics and music.Why buy it?Loveable protagonistsFantastic atmosphereGreat storytellingDiverse gameplay - fast combat with fun puzzles and minigamesWonderful music and sound effectsPersonally, I also really enjoy the cartoony, colourful graphics styleWhy not?It is a port from the X-box (classic), and a somewhat poor one: some people are having problems setting the game up properly, and are having some difficulties with the controlsIt's (13 years!) old, so you might find the graphics a bit outdated "

												This is a great game. Strong female lead, love the stealth and photography mechanics, great story, wonderful characters. BEWARE THE PARTNER GLITCH. At certain points in the game, your tag along pal might glitch out. Rotate your saves, and DO NOT SAVE WHILE YOU ARE ALONE, because you can't get the tag along back, and you need them for progression. If at any point when you have a partner you notice them missing, reload a previous save. Other than that one minor problem, Beyond Good and Evil is an amazing game, and I'm very sad a sequel will probably never happen. ;_;			"

												I nominate this game for ""Best use of a farm animal Award"", back when Ubisoft was making top quality games like this one. It's charming, atmospheric and it's one of the first games to introduce a strong female protagonist. My biggest complain would be the camera angles that can be frustrating at times but if you can get through that it's an enjoyable game.			"

												One of the best games I've ever played! The story is amazing, the characters are heartwarming, funny and it's just so much fun to get through the game. Just let me say, it actually never gets boring to play that game. And it's impossible to NOT like the characters! If you are interested in good stories, neat graphics (yeah, this game is pretty old, but the graphics are also a + for the game okay!) and funny quotes as well as some good old fighting moments, then you'll have a lot of fun with that game. I also like the environment and the slighty futuristic touch in the game! :-)			"

												First of all, I love this game. Beyond Good & Evil is great.But DO NOT buy this game for the pc. It is an insult that Ubisoft/Steam would release and sell this.As it stands it does not appear to support widescreen, controllers, and it is a bit on the finiky side with new technology.There may be some fixes out there for it, but it is still unacceptable to release a game in this state.Hopefully Steam will release an update or a fixed version in the future, but as of now in its current condition I would avoid.

												Excellent third person action game. It's been a long while since I've seen this game, but even though I was ""late"" to the party, so to speak, as I didn't play it anywhere close to initial release, the game held up brilliantly. Aside from a few mandatory stealth sections which were more annoying than fun, it was solid start-to-finish, and I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

Are you ready to transcend morality and petty social convention?Though disappointed initially by the lack of Nietzsche, Beyond Good & Evil delivers a good action-adventure game that delves into some surprisingly dark themes and mature content. The beautiful visuals really have helped with how finely the game has aged over the years, with lighting in particular creating some stunning vistas and stellar views of the various landscapes and colourful underground. A gritty approach to science fiction, BGE follows the young photojournalist Jade, a caretaker of sorts for a bunch of ragtag kids and orphans on the planet of Hyllis, along with her long-time friend and mentor Pey’J. Futuristic but with noticeable fantasy and steampunk influences, the on-going war between the supposedly benevolent Alpha Sections regime and the “DomZ” – a seemingly endless alien force – in the backdrop to an otherwise peaceful, everyday setting gradually begins to appear as more than it seems. Pulled into a momentous conspiracy cover-up, you’re tasked to reveal the truth and ignite a revolution.Gameplay is broken down into a mixture of free-roaming, puzzles and stealth sections. There’s a decent enough amount of content for you to try outside of missions, but most of it generally comes down to forgettable mini-games and pearl hunting. The stealth system is very simplistic but works well for what it sets out to do, even if you’ll find yourself asking how on earth you managed to sneak past that guard without being detected.In terms of puzzles, they’re generally straightforward to do and rely on grasping the layout of the level’s environment, though may appear bewildering in design at times. Any more than this I can’t really comment on, considering my own legendary impatience and lack of skill in solving video game puzzles. Be ready to add a bit more on to the average completion time if you’re in a similar position. The art style is great, with a nice vibrancy and cartoonish aesthetic to it, and character models equally so. The sound design is fantastic, with the score in particular really creating a moody, sci-fi ambiance. Some of it’s almost reminiscent of Kelly Bailey’s work for Half-Life and suits the game perfectly. However, BGE does suffer from the typical trappings of the genre’s design. The fixed camera positions can be a nightmare at times, especially in vehicle sections, and this has a rather significant effect on not only basic navigation but the otherwise smooth and relatively satisfying gameplay. Jade has some great moves in combat, (think of a more dexterous equivalent to Monkey’s style in Enslaved: Odyssey to the West), but the camera and constantly changing direction of movement controls can be immensely frustrating to wrestle with. Also, facial animations and lip-syncing doesn’t occur for in-game/contextual dialogue… another odd drawback. Some other more minor issues generally come down to noticeable clipping and some A.I. quirks but overall the technical aspects are quite good.The biggest failing of Beyond Good & Evil is in the constant grind that is required to progress throughout the main story. Being an older adventure game and thus featuring the obligatory unlock currency system, BGE requires you to upgrade the central hovercraft vehicle with the collectible pearls that are scattered throughout the map and various levels. While most of these you’ll come by incidentally, completing tasks or through purchases, you will eventually be required to painfully grind to receive the next unlock, most likely at the end of the game, where this shouldn’t be happening at the most. (♥♥♥♥ing hell, that final boss fight was brutal.)While I can understand this age-old trope of game design, it really detracts from an otherwise enjoyable game when the story itself is locked off to you. There is no cheat code or other way to bypass these mind-numbing sections outside of a custom editor, so the grind is unfortunately inevitable. You might argue that this was done to encourage exploration, but the game was already worth delving into and shouldn't have to be forced upon players either. The best way to avoid it would be to just carefully scour the levels early on and try and complete miscellaneous tasks wherever possible. In all honesty, I don’t usually go for these kinds of games but found Beyond Good & Evil to be really enjoyable. If you’re a fan of the likes of Tomb Raider, Zelda, Shadow of the Colossus or Devil May Cry, you’ll be right at home here with a good experience all-round on offer, totalling around 10 or so hours of play. You can also remind yourself of what Ubisoft used to be.It may be in development hell, but whenever the second game comes, it’ll be worth it. Thumbs up.			"

												I first played this on console and the PC version holds very true in all respects to the original. However, important Con/negative first as it's a biggie.Con: You can NOT fully complete the game because an in-game treat/easter egg/bonus requires you using a code on a website page that no longer exists. This cannot even be obtained via online guides or cheating (unless you get a save file from someone with the proper code if they exist - I've not checked.)Pro's:Open world that expands as you get further in the game (ability to hop over force field/energy fences, spaceship, etc.)Unique plot that's actually rather fun.Gain credits/money via your skill in taking photos (which also gives you pearls, which are used in the black market for items you need.) This can take some time to get right and multiple animals in a shot is truly helpful and gives bonuses. Keep that in mind.There's really a fair bit of enjoyment in the game as long as you're okay with not being able to fully finish it (a pain for me) as mentioned.Overall: 10/10 (considering its age, I can't hold the lack of webpage being down for the 100% option being gone.)-Paladeus			"

												 Simply one of the best video games ever made. Unfortunately it was made by a company that has no respect for PC gaming and actively views pc gamers as nothing but whitney pirates not worth their trouble. So they released this broken port as a cash grab. The work-arounds to get this one up and functioning are long and a bit arduous, but doable (see the guide I compiled for how I got it functioning). Again this is another example of Ubisoft expressing their disdain of our hobby. Its just too bad that such a beautiful game had to be caught in the middle.All in all I cannot recommend an incredible game that you have to rely on the goodwill of unpaid enthusiasts to make playable. Again this is ubisoft giving us a non-functioning product for full price when you would be better off just getting a cracked version from day one.			"

												Beyond Good and Evil stands alongside Okami and Darksiders as the very best Legend of Zelda-likes. Bolstering lovable characters, an interesting story, a believable world immersed in conflict, and an interesting array of dungeons and world building, BG&E is a very fun action adventure title that's well worth its price. It's not a perfect game, nor is it ""incredible"", but it's in no way just average. Some minor quips are that the controls and camera can act pretty awful, and it sometimes becomes pretty easy to get lost.Personally, I feel that the game is at its strongest in the first of its four dungeons, as it is most evocative of Zelda during this time. Following the first dungeon, the game begins to stress its stealth elements, something rarely seen in Zelda, but not unwelcomed in BG&E. I feel that the game's dungeons tend to take a small dive, but it recovers for the end and wraps up in a satisfying conclusion. (That is, unless you watch after the credits)			"

												Story first, i got this game around 2003-04 when i was just a simple kid with no english language skills. Only things i understood about this game was:#1. Hit evil aliens in the face#2. Pig man is your friend.#3. Take photos of animals and things#4. Go around in a hovercraft.. somewhere.Back then, i only visited the Hillys City and never went forward from there. I played it maybe a couple of days, then, i forgot the game for a long time. At times i heard and saw something about the game, the upcoming sequal etc. But never i decided to playthrough it, even though i was always intrigued about it.UNTIL NOW. I saw Beyond Good & Evil in steam sale under 2 euros. There, in that moment,i decided finally to play it through. Better late than never, right?And oh man yes, i did the right choice.The interesting semi-open world, diverse characters which you actually start to care about. Unique art style, awesome soundtrack as well great sound desing overall.Fun engaging and unique gameplay mechanics and the gripping, touching, even shocking story makes this game truly a masterpiece.PS: To make Beyond Good & Evil work in modern PC's properly, remember to DISABLE these settings in the Advanced Settings tab in the games launcher/SettingsApplication.exe:- HW Vertex Processing- Multi vertex stream- Autogen mipmapThis is how you get rid of the annoying flickering stuff.I also recommend this Widescreen Fix: http://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/22-beyond-good-evil-widescreen-fix/Like it says, ""Extract the files to the same folder as BGE.exe and edit the included .ini file to achieve your desired resolution. Don't forget to set the game's resolution to the same values as you did in the .ini, failing to do so will result in resolution glitches in most cases.""For more help, visit http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Beyond_Good_%26_Evil "

Actually, THIS IS AS POOR AS PC PORTS COME! - Glitchy graphics- Framerate issues- Sound and sync issues- Compatibility problems- Zero controller supportYou name'm, this stinky mother of a port has them all.

												Though the game's story never gets quite as interesting as the title would suggest and the camera is very much from the early 2000s, on the whole, Beyond Good and Evil is one darn good game that you could probably squeeze between 8-12 hours out of. I'd especially reccommend it to Zelda fans who want to try something new yet familiar (or don't want to shell out for a console).And though it's always better to buy things on sale if you can, if you're really interested, I don't think anyone who pays $9.99 for this will be too terribly disappointed.

-Quick Review-Beyond Good and Evil is Ubisoft's under-rated-masterpiece, it was first released on the PlayStation 2 on November 11, 2003. The beautiful Music was Composed by Christophe Héral.Beyond Good and Evil is by far the most beautiful, outstanding game I ever played on the PS2, and when I saw it was available on Steam I exploded. There are many games that we as gamers 'play and forget'. Beyond Good and Evil is one of the games I will never forget.-Video Review!-

			Atratzu Reviews Beyond Good and Evil, for the Playstation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Steam PC port. This is one of the RPG's he speaks most highly of, so it's befitting this is the first game he reviews!		

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: Beyond Good and Evil's Protagonist is a bright young woman named Jade. Jade is an avid martial artist, photographer and investigative reporter. She has been staying with her 'Uncle' Pay'j (A pig/boar-like biped, whom is acting as Jade's Guardian) to help take care of orphans at their lighthouse home.Jade and Pay'j are on the mining planet “Hillys”. Hillys is under siege by an extraterrestrial group known as the “DomZ”, the DomZ are skeleton-reaper-like-aliens whom abduct and drain the life from their victims. Recently a group known as “The Alpha Sections” have taken up residence on Hillys. The Alpha Sections have sworn to defend the population of Hillys from these devastating DomZ attacks.


Just an awesome moment in the begining of the game. 
A Screenshot of Beyond Good & Evil
By: Atratzu




Gameplay: You play the game as Jade, in a third person camera view, the game is broken down into two modes: combat mode and stealth mode. (Side note: There is much more to the game than that, sometimes you need to take pictures, solve puzzles, figure out riddles, play mini games, and have dialogue with other NPC's.)When in combat, Jade wields a special Bo Staff known as a “Jō”; Jade preforms strikes, flips, and power attacks while in combat mode. If you were unsuccessful in sneaking past enemies you can fight your way through many parts of the game. However there is definitely an emphasis on stealth rather than fighting.When in stealth, Jade sneaks and rolls, there are oftentimes alternative paths to sneak around guards, other times you need to distract guards by creating a diversion to take them away from their posts, while you sneak past.

A final note I should make, is the console to PC port wasn't quite perfect; the camera angle is sometimes a little bit awkward, but you eventually get used to the limitations and controls; Beyond Good and Evil is still very playable.Achievements: There are no achievements in the game, however there are extra things to collect while playing. You can take pictures of all the animals in the game, and collect all the pearls, and find every M-disks. Price: Beyond Good and Evil is priced at $9.99, my first play through I unlocked everything before beating the game (I took my sweet time about it, and it took about 9-11 hours) the game can easily take anywhere from 6-8 hours to complete.When I was younger playing this game on the PS2; I remember that I almost beat this whole game in a day. My parrents left the house in the late morning and I started playing Beyond Good and Evil, when they got back that evening I was still playing. Needless to say, they were not pleased with my binge-playing-habits.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=511832156Conclusion: Seriously, just buy and play this game.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update August 29, 2015:Spelling fix, by Angfucious.

												Before I get too far into this I'll start by saying that Beyond Good And Evil is in no way the best game ever made, as some would have you believe. I've clocked this game a bunch of times on various systems, Ive bought it no less then 4 times (PS2, PS3, Windows and Steam)... that alone should tell you how much I like this platformer.The controls could be improved and the battle is in no way the best but if you can overlook that and want a beautifully atmospheric world to explore then pick it up. I think it's well worth the purchase (especially at $10 or your regional equivalent).Cool funky music, a nice water world to traverse in your hover craft, quirky characters to interact with and nicely designed enemies to fight with. Even a nice little horor/anti-establishment feel to story. Jade (our hero) is one of my favourite female leeds. Looks cool, well voice acted, strong kickarse attitude who is half melee brawler and half super sleuth trying to get to the bottom of this epic mystery.I have been eagerly awaiting Beyond Good And Evil 2 since 2008... as have a dedicated fan base... if it ever comes out I will snap it up in a heart beat (after looking at reviews to make sure they didn't just poop out a half arsed sequel for the sake of making money) but in the mean time, I'll happily fire this up again.

												An action adventure game where the main focus is stealth and photography. AKA, you get to be a secret agent in a sort of steampunk-ish fantasy world under an oppressive regime, who can't fight well and has to primarily avoid combat in favour of gathering actual evidence of corruption and abuse. Roll that in with an amazing female protagonist, you have one of the best games ever made.			"

												I played this game in my youth and I have many fond memories of the game. The art style, animation style, and soundtrack all give this game a unique and emersive feel. It is a stealth game at its core but has some great action sequences and lends itself well to a cinematic feel. It is easier now than I remember it being and the story isn't very long either. The graphics have aged reasonably well and the gameplay and story are still quite enjoyable. I would recomend this game to most if not all of my friends especially if its on sale. 8/10			"

												Steam says 0 hours but I promise I've played it on Steam and obviously on PS2 back when it was out.What an amazing game. A completely underrated classic. Originally released in 2003 and it's still as fun today as it was then. I cannot recommend this game enough and at £6.99 you are absolutely missing out if you don't buy this. A beautifully written story with loveable characters and plenty of puzzle/stealth. Difficult to get working on windows so be prepared to go googling for work-arounds and fixes, literally my only complaint.Eagerly awaiting the sequel, stop making Assassins Creed games and give us what we want.

												Yes, it's not an overly brutal and serious game. Yes, the graphics are rather dated. But damn, this story. These characters. This soundtrack.The story is engaging and there are some nice plot twists to keep you on your toes. The characters are likable and each has their own personality. Especially Jade. Can we have more protagonists like her, please? She's a reporter armed with a camera and a staff. Not yet another one of those bloodthirsty, psychopathic assassins, and this is a really refreshing change.There could have been more explanation for why things are, as the answer to that quite often seems to be ""just because"". Also, be warned, quite often you'll not only have to fight monsters, but also the camera - it's annoying.Overall though, it's a pleasant game, and I enjoyed every moment of it. "

The truth is the controls are a bit weird and the textures can get a bit funky sometimes, but even with all that I still thoroughly enjoyed playing this game AGAIN (and expect to play it many more times).

												It's hard to say for me if the biggest pro is the soundtrack or the story and the characters, but they are both damn good. Sure it's old (released in 2003), but for me thanks to this it easily grabs my nostalgia, since I played it a lot back then.Well, there are some issues, controls can really annoy sometimes, it might be hard to make the game run smoothly, and so on...With this many reviews it's kind of hard to add anything new, besides few minor things: indeed, there is a special currency which is required to go on with the story, but I wouldn't say it's a problem to collect the right amount since most of them are found on your standard way through the game, and it might not be necessary to engage yourself with the arcade part of the game if you don't want to. Second thing: it's not *that* long, but it is a game that I really like to come back to every once in a while. It's interesting that (at least for me) the graphics didn't age that much. Of course, you can see the diffrence between BG&E and latest games, but the thing is that graphics don't take away your attention from the story. As for troubleshooting the graphics, there are solutions on the internet how to change game's settings so that it runs on newer machines (solutions for Win7 work also for Win10).And the sequel... Originally (from what I know) it was meant as a trilogy, but it wasn't much of a success so second part is still in the production, and nobody knows when will they release it. But we're waiting.tl;dr: yes, it's worth it.			"

												BGE deserves enormous praise for its characters and story, especially. Jade is such a delightfully non-cliche female lead character; other studios should study her to understand how to make female characters that aren't eye candy or whose rescue is the main goal of the manly protagonist.

												A fantastic game if I do say so myself! There’s a reason this game is in the top ten of games that deserve a sequel. This game is not dated at all even if the graphics are a bit wonky at times. Plus the camera can be a bit annoying but after playing games like tomb raider, its nothing. The game has a great story, vibrant characters, a beautiful world, and a great mix of stealth, combat, plat forming and puzzles. Plus there is all the additions that come from Latin, Jamaican and Japanese cultures added within. Put in there a beautiful soundtrack and you have the making of an impressive game. Plus it has probably one of the best female protagonist I've ever seen. The game has so much to offer and I wish it was longer. Sadly a sequel isn't in sight right now but who knows. I'm sure one day Ubisoft will pick this gem up and give it a much deserved sequel. At 2 dollars, this game is worth every penny! You should really play this game.			"

												Beyond Good & Evil is a fine game. The story is good, the gameplay is great. It's a free-roam adventure, where you explore a small world and persue the story at your own pace. This game is unpretentiously fun.Your character is a reporter investigating a grand conspiracy theme. Gameplay centers around Infiltrating government and industrial sites to capture clues and unravel the mystery. There are stealth elements, too, and occasional combat. And a sort of internal achievement system that rewards you for capturing photographs along the way of rare fauna. BG&E has the best sidekick characters since Grim Fandango, and a similar smart sense of humor. It's a console port, but the controls are decent, despite this. I finished the game with mouse and keyboard with no difficulty. The graphics are PS2-era, but they have a distinct style of their own. Jade reminds me more than a little of HL2's Alyx.I understand that there is a ""Beyond Good & Evil 2"" coming soon; catch up on the storyline first.			"

												If you're tired of quasi-historical figures stabing their way through the past and being all emo about it, then give this game a look. A good mix of stealth, puzzle solving, and (an this is my own personal kryptonite) racing. Has it aged well, compared to some current games? Not perfectly, but it's still a very serviceable game, a lot of fun to play, and Jade is a likeable, relatable female lead. The only issue is the camera in some scenes, and the controls to have a bit of a learning curve, especially in race segments.But aside from those nitpicks, and a depressing lack of a sequel, Beyond Good & Evil is a game I would recommend to anyone!

												I never played the original and this is my first experience with this game. I did have a bunch of graphical problems, and controller issues (I have an old random pc controller so I had to use Xpadder)A fun and neat game, I usually don't play stealth games so this was interesting! Story was interesting, I like how the (human) character designs and art style kind of clashed with the propaganda/human experimentation thing the game's story offered. The only negative point was the ship, I hated the Slaughterhouse level because of the ship controls.At the start I did try to collect everything but the Slaughterhouse really bummed me out so after that I just wanted to complete the game. I'm probably being too negative because of that but I just really don't like driving mechanics and boy that ship was bad, anyways.Combat was meh, nothing fancy, the stealth was where it was at.There isn't much replay value to this game so I dont really see myself playing it again, but if they ever made the sequel they SAID they were going to I'd definitely check it out!

												It's a shame that this amazing game was never properly recognized. If you're a fan of action adventure games, look no further because this is the best you can get, even in comparison with today's titles. I won't summarize the story, but let me just write that the main character is an independent young woman named Jade who happens to be a reporter on a planet that is currently in the middle of a war. Although your main task is to uncover the cospiracy that involves your planet's government, there are also side quests you can work on, the best being photographing all the species you encounter. The atmosphere and story are excellent, and some characters you simply have to love (Pey'j). The game balances stealth and action well and once you get used to the controls, it's pretty intuitive. For 5 euro, it's a must have.			"

												I like the old games because they're awesome. You can feel the passion to create games from the creators when you are playing this game. Also the old games have another essence that make you appreciate them and never forget them. This game contains a lot of mechanics; racing, adventure, fighting, exploring, camera mechanics,  puzzles and collections.  Also It takes away the bad taste from playing Tales of zestiria (lol). The only inconvenient for me, It´s the camera in the rooms where you need to sneak from enemies and when you fail, you must fight them but the angle camera change a lot and obstruct you in the fight.

												3:00 am, just beat this game in two days, sadly. This game is incredible. The art style is beautiful and the soundtrack immerses you into the game so well. This is a game that gets hard to put away. If you don't care about graphics (this game is from 2003) and you want an immersive storyline with characters that are impossible to not love, then play this game. Maybe its just the nostalgia coming in, but I love this game so much its unbelievable. One of my favourite games ever, probably my favourite PS2 game. The only problem I had was the PC version is slightly glitchy, you need to change a few thigns in advanced options to get it running smoothly. It kinda makes peoples mouth move funny but its not a big deal. It didn't seem overly optimized for PC, sometimes the camera left a little to be desired but for the most part it was decent.The only thing I would say is I hate the ending. But I hate it because BGE 2 is not a thing yet and the ending feels more like a beginning than an end. I have never wanted a sequel more than this, I was excited when I heard about Fallout 4, but if BGE 2 ever comes out I might need 4 new changes of pantsAlso, don't watch all of the credits unless you want to stab yourself in the face 6000 times a day waiting for the sequelHOLY ♥♥♥♥ UBI, WHERE'S TEH FAKING GAME its like they don't understand, this wouldn't be GOTY, it would be GOTC (century) it would be the greatest game of all time, why cant they just make it already holyshitholyshitholyshitholyshit im dying D:.

												Bought this game because of nostalgia but when I purchased, downloaded and finally launched it, I was welcomed with 2x-speed main menu and custscenes. After a good amount of research, I learnt that this game does not work well with modern PC's specially with Windows 8. Would I recommend this game? Of course! But only if you find a way to make it run smoothly otherwise I would stay away from the PC version and get the Console version instead.			"

												If you can get an original console version, do so. The port is lazy and has a lot of graphics issues. That being said, this is still a great game that I recommend highly to everyone. If Ubisoft ever actually makes the sequel they've been promising for years I will literally throw a party and force all of my friends to play it.			"

												Still, way to few people talk about this game. Speculations about the sequel change frequently and make it all the harder to play this game time and time again. Not because it isn't fun, but because you want more - you don't want this to be all.BG&E is a game which I could pick up and play to 100% completion any second - and I would enjoy myself. I played it first on my gamecube and when it released on Steam it was an instabuy and an instaplay. Start to finish. And there was hardly any minute, nay second in which I didn't like what the game had to offer. Before I get to the game itself, just a little insight into my perspective towards a special kind of games (feel free to skip):This game reminds me of the good ol' Rareware. Back in the 90ies and early 2000's before they sold their soul to Microsoft. Games made with love, attention to detail, heart and (and I can't believe that this is a trademark that needs to be pointed out) color. Games like Banjo-Kazooie, Conkers Bad Fur Day and weirdly enough this Ubisoft-Game stick out to me not just gameplay-wise, but also visually. They are bright where they need to be and dark when it is necessary - but they always ooze charme and liveliness. And to be fair - in its catalog of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and unpolished games, Ubisoft does have some amazing titles - Child of Light and Rayman come to mind. All these aforementioned games fall into a special kind of category for me. They all feel different and distinct from each other, but still weirdly similar. They all share the high quality anyways. But hey, maybe that is just me.About BG&E itself:Beyond good and evil is an action adventure mix without any outstanding design decisions, but everything that is in the game, is very well implemented, while still being kinda basic. There is a simple combat system, which doesn't reach the levels of a spectacle fighter - reminiscent of Starfox Adventures. There is a stealth system, but it isn't as deep as the likes of Metal Gear, Splinter Cell or Thief. There is some sense of Open-World-Exploration, but please don't expect GTA or Skyrim. There is photography, but (sadly) no Prof. Oak to evaluate your skills regarding capturing Snorlax' butt on polaroid. And there are racing-sequences, which...well they are rather tight actually - I lik'em.This game gives you a bit of everything in bitesized chunks and delivers a quite well presented story on the side. It is vast, but not intimidating. You can actually complete it 100% without doing a lot of unnecessary walking and searching - yet it feels rewarding. IMHO this is a game that you need to play to experience its appeal firsthand. Don't read about it, don't watch a Let's play - play it. It is really well polished, casts some memorable characters and, apart from the overall length of the game, does not leave much to be desired.			"

												I played the classic version not the HD version. I had to find and apply a couple of patches to sort out graphical issues playing a 2003 game in 2016.What a cool game! So well designed and lovingly crafted. Unique, imaginative, whimsical yet stylish. Very varied gameplay styles and pacing. Chase sequences are hectic and slickly designed. Good puzzles, lots of secret bits and side games, plenty of stuff to do, varied ways of acheiving goals. Great music. Good character animation.Bad things: Horrible, horrible third person camera - disorienting, gets stuck, even gets you killed occasionally, so frustrating! Sometimes your companions block your path.

												It seems the developers of this game kept the graphics simple so that they could focus on a very nice storyline. The fighting is fluid and the chase events blend smoothly into the cutscenes to the point where you'd believe it was your idea to jump off that rooftop all along! The story has just the right number of twists to keep you in suspense without seeming like they're just prolonging the ending. The characters are richly developed and enhances the game's emotional side. Very nicely done.			"

												To be perfectly honest I have no idea why this game gets all the praise it does, maybe I went into it with too high of expectations or maybe it just hasn't aged well but I was not blown out of the water by Beyond Good and Evil. That being said, it’s a good game. The combat is really fun, controls really well(outside of the flying parts) and it’s varied enough that it never really gets boring. The story, while not super amazing, is still pretty decent. There’s a lot they could have done with it that wasn’t done and with the namesake it has I really expected more out of the story. Even though the story was underwhelming the most standout part of this game, and the most enjoyable, is definitely the 100% believable female protagonist. It’s really nice to be able to play a woman who isn’t overly sexualized or a stereotypical manly, badass female. Unlike so many other female protagonist Jade is written like she’s a real, well rounded person. More writers need to play this game so they can learn how to write realistic characters, both female and male.			"

												I've been interested in Beyond Good&Evil for a very long time but I never got around to picking the game up. Well, thanks to Steam I finally got a chance to try the game out for cheap, and MAN IS IT AWESOME! The game has a very intriguing storyline where, as Jade, you must use your skills as a photo-journalist...or a f***king ninja... to expose a sinister government ploy. ""Uncover the Conspiracy. Capture the Truth."" ALL the music in the game is just beautiful...seriously...DAT F**KING PIANO. Beyond Good&Evil also has a great visual style, which totally makes up for the graphical limitations of it's time. While playing through it, I just fell in love with the game. I loved all the interesting characters and it's whimsical tone, and I was very engaged in the story. I enjoyed Beyond Good&Evil IMMENSELY and it is easily one of my favourite games of all time.

												Beyond Good and Evil (German: Jenseits von Gut und Böse; subtitled ""Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future"" (German: Vorspiel einer Philosophie der Zukunft)) is a book by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, first published in 1886.It takes up and expands on the ideas of his previous work, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, but approached from a more critical, polemical direction.In Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche accuses past philosophers of lacking critical sense and blindly accepting Judeo-Christian premises in their consideration of morality. The work moves into the realm ""beyond good and evil"" in the sense of leaving behind the traditional morality which Nietzsche subjects to a destructive critique in favour of what he regards as an affirmative approach that fearlessly confronts the perspectival nature of knowledge and the perilous condition of the modern individual.

												Firstly, I didn't have a chance to play this when it originally came out and I also don't have too much experience with the 3rd person action adventure genre, so this opinion is relatively nostalgia or genre prejudice free.My issues with the game are mostly related to technical difficulties when attempting to get it up an running:  It'll always complain that your display drivers are out of date when launching (at least on an ATI card)  Audio goes off sync if you don't run it on a single core affinity  Your display settings need to be correct to avoid texture flickering  No out of box controller support for smoother analogue movementProbably something a patch or two could fix but they seem to have abandoned this one. You could also work around the controller issue by mapping the buttons using a 3rd party software such as JoyToKey, but you can't make it analogue though. I played this on keyboard and mouse due to that limitation and it's not bad, I just would've liked to play on the couch in Big Picture mode.Apart from those technical issues I could say that everything else about the game is good. The story and the characters are likeable and well-written. I particularly liked Uncle Pey'j, who is probably now one of my favourite sidekick characters in all games. Voice acting was pretty much spot on for each character, maybe little on a campy side with different accents and all that, but as long as it fits.. Same could be said about the music.I was a little worried that the early 2000s 3D graphics haven't aged well, but luckily my worries were in vain: Especially character movement and facial animations have stood the test of time and overall the game is still a pleasure to look at.I wasn't really a fan of the face to face combat sequences, which occasionally just turned into mashing fests with little to no idea which enemy I was targeting. Your character, Jade, also locks into enemies which can make her a bit hard to control in combat. Stealth sections were a nice change of pace though, and I didn't have too much trouble with the camera that seems to have been an issue for others.Solid fun for 10+ hours. I'm joining the group of people waiting for the sequel.			"

I first played it on PS2 and was delighted to find it on Steam some time ago.Great story, fun battle mechanics and unique inclusion of the camera/photography element that's essential to the game, but not tedious to use. The implementation of the creature cataloguing system is especially unique and rewarding. Quirky characters and uplifting soundtrack are especially delightful.I may be a little biased because ~*childhood*~ but 10/10 would bang.			"

												It's hard to say who this game was meant for. It looks rather kiddy at first, but deals with some dark themes and plotlines, and also is rather frustratingly difficult at times. In many ways the definition of an award-winning flop, it's got a quirky style to it that you may or may not be on board with. Gameplay consists of platforming (which is solid), combat (which is bland), stealth (which is fun but frustrating), and driving/shooting (which is unpleasant). Nothing in the gameplay really stands out as exceptional, but the world and story are well-realized, even if the plot is sometimes overdramatic. Flawed, but charming and memorable. It's goofy and creative in its best moments, awkward and sloppy at its worst. There's a lot to like and enjoy, but plenty of moments that left me scratching my head. Difficulty was all over the place, with tricky parts not helped by the camera, but most of it was on the easier side. Despite what it has going against it, the quirkiness and setting were more than enough to drive my curiosity to the ending. I experienced some minor technical issues on windows 8.1, mostly just flickering textures, and a crash or two, but I didn't consider them enough of a bother to stop me from playing. Your experience may vary, as this is known to be somewhat unstable on newer OS's.			"

Also very cheap on steam, do yourself a favor and play this game, if you're lucky that you can run it without many crashes/FPS drops.

												I first played this game when I was young, and still to this day I haven't found a game that has come close to comparing to this. The game felt like it was ahead of its time. With the fantastic game world and atmosphere, it really pulled you back in for more. The game has such an amazing story, it's saddening that there isn't a sequel yet. The only thing I have to complain about is the PC porting. They really could've spent more time on mastering the keyboard/mouse controls for this game, but thankfully there's fixes for them on the internet.Beyond Good and Evil is a game you definitely don't want to pass up!

												Man, this gameThis is more than a 3rd Person beat em up, this is a 3rd person stealth adventure racing game with collecting elements and you CAN beat people up. The story is decent, but the characters are all very loveable, especially Jade, the spunky, tough tomboy you play as. You simply CAN'T play this game correctly without going out of your way to collect photos of the great amount of fauna that litters Hillys, competing in the races, or hunting down the pearls. You can probably go through most of the game pacifistically, but you can also kill everything in sight. Personally, it gives me a very Jak and Daxter feeling, and I find it very charming. This version is kind of a pain to play though, basically, what you have to do, is turn water reflections off and WHILE you're in game, go to your task manager, go to processes, right click BGE, go to affinities, and select only one core. The way it worked for me is you had to close the task manager and turn the game off, then turn it on again. Even then, there were some issues with the framerate and sound lag. It was annoying, especially at the end when there's a lot of ♥♥♥♥ going on. But overall it's a very good game that I enjoyed nearly every second of, and I recommend it to all of you.			"

												Not your average game but you're probably aware of that. Great music, sensational pacing (seriously, that is the thought that struck me as soon as credits rolled), and a final boss that is challenging enough that it gives you a sense of accomplishment when you finally beat it. Game play is generally stealth/ platformer and both work well (as soon as you unlearn everything from current gen free-running platformers).			"

												This is probably one of the best games I have ever played. Super fun, very well paced and really interesting characters and story. It plays out sorta like a Legend of Zelda game (The action adventure genre) where you slowly gain more items, health and trinkets while you play the game and explore the world. The game is decently challenging without going overboard.One thing I remember a lot about this game was how the world actually changed over time as different events happened throught the game. You know how in most games, some big crazy event happens, but when you go the the main town everyone is still running around like nothing ever happened. In this game, the world and people living in it visable change as events happen. This is something I don't feel like happens in games (I have no idea why) but really helps make the world feel real and keeps you immersed.I highly recommend this game. It's cheap and totally worth every minute.			"

It has a unique style to it and the music sets the mood perfectly, for the lovely lighthouse shelter as well as the darkest strongholds of the evil aliens. I don't really know what to say about this game. It's about a young reporter named Jade, who lives with her uncle(Who happens to be a pig) in a lighthouse that shelters children who have lost their parents to the war against and evil alien armada, known as the DomZ.

												Beyond Good and Evil is such an interesting game. In my case, I enjoyed the storyline and the gameplay to the max. Plus, I can actually be a girl and not a boy like in most games. (Not trying to be a feminazi, but I hope you guys get my drift.) Aside from savig the world and whatnot, you get to learn about the background of the main character and others. Not only that, you get a job as a photographer and taking pictures of different creatures is quite fun. That is like the most relaxing thing in the whole game. (Unless you are actually fighting the creautre.) At certain levels, the enemies tend to be annoying or just a pain in your gut. This games has been in my faves since the first time that I played it on the playstation 2 and still is. I highly recommend it to everyone, it doesn't hurt to try it out. :)			"

												One of the best games you've probably never played.  Beyond Good and Evil is an action adventure game that I think everyone should play.  The PC version is probably the worst version, in my opinion, but even with that it is still worth buying.  The graphics hold up surprisingly well and look great.  Don't let the colorful graphics fool you though, the story is surprisingly mature.The game has awesome/likable characters, a good story, a strong female lead who isn't over sexualized, the list goes on.  It isn't perfect though, especially not this version.  The game begs to be played with a controller, there are invisible walls all over the place which can be annoying sometimes and there are some bugs not in the console versions like the flickering graphics bug.Overall, this is a criminally underrated/underappreciated game that I think everyone should play.A-			"

It was a pure joy back on the old PS2 and it still is on the PC. It will take some tweaking to get it running properly, however once achived, it sure will pay of if you can oversee the dated graphics and a crash now and then. It is a well made mix of a 3D platformer, puzzler and combat game, with some intersting sidestories and a nice main plot. Old but still recomended!			"

												Beyond Good & Evil puts you in the role of Jade, a young woman who, along with her humanoid pig uncle Pey'j, runs a lighthouse on the planet Hillys. Hillys is at war with an alien force known as the DomZ, and an elite squadron known as the Alpha Sections protects Hillys from the alien threat. Or does it? An underground rebel organization known as the IRIS Network charges that the Alphas control both sides of the equation. IRIS is essentially a rogue news network, informing the people via a newsletter that strives to expose the link between Hillys' protectors and the alien menace. That's where Jade, a photographer-for-hire when not tending to the lighthouse, comes in. You quickly hook up with IRIS and spend the bulk of the game infiltrating Alpha strongholds.But you won't go at it alone. The game gives you a companion most of the time, and many puzzles will require you to get your associate to do things. Only one contextual button is used to command your companion, so it's usually pretty easy to get him to act. The AI of your partner is usually pretty good, but we occasionally had to backtrack to get him unstuck from walls or railings.Most of the game's interior sections have you out, on foot, and in search of photographic evidence. You're looking for specific pictures, and the areas of interest are marked on your map. The game does have combat, but it's a fairly straightforward system that suffices without excelling. The real meat of the gameplay comes from its puzzle-solving, though there's a little too much repetition in the puzzles, which can make some sections of the game feel pretty tedious. Almost every room will require you to do a little thinking. Sometimes it's as easy as using your projectile attack to push a button on the other side of a force field. Sometimes you'll have to find fuses in other parts of an installation to power elevators or other equipment. Sometimes you'll have to learn a password to proceed into a locked area. And there's a whole lot of sneaking around.In Beyond Good & Evil, stealth is treated much like the rest of the game's puzzles. You simply want to get to the next room, but patrolling guards are in the way. So you'll either have to avoid detection by staying out of sight or incapacitate the guards by blinding them with a well-placed shot to the tank on their backs. A guard can repair another guard's faulty tank, so in rooms with multiple guards, you'll have to either be a fast shot or find a quieter way through. The game's 10- to 15-hour quest also has you piloting a hovercraft, which is your primary mode of transport on Hillys. The Hovercraft can shoot, and you'll upgrade it over time to fire more powerful blasts, as well as give it the ability to jump. Upgrading your Hovercraft requires you to spend pearls at an upgrade shop. Pearls are fairly rare on Hillys and you'll get them in various ways ( for example  by defeating bosses or purchasing them from seedy merchants using credits, the game's main currency which you can earn by defeating enemies, find them in crates or by taking photos of the different animals in the game).The game controls quite well with a mouse and keyboard, using fairly standard third-person action game controls that are, of course, fully configurable.While the game behind the presentation is pretty good on its own, the entire package benefits from some pretty nice audio and video. The game is graphically impressive. The world of Hillys is beautifully rendered. It's large and atmospheric, and the outdoor segments show off some nice-looking water. The interior of the buildings you'll be infiltrating are appropriately dark and intimidating, with a hefty dose of effective lighting. The game's shadows usually look great, as well, though we noticed a couple of instances of shadows being unnaturally cast on walls and ceilings. It's a minor point, for sure, but given how amazing the rest of the game looks, little things like that tend to stick out. While the console versions of the game look outstanding in their own right (played on Nintendo Gamecube), the PC version definitely has a sharper, cleaner look to it. The water effects, well-placed blur effects, reflections, textures, and models really jump off the screen.While the game's repetitive nature and short length take away from its overall impact, Beyond Good & Evil is a fantastic-looking game that tells its story well. It may be short enough to complete in a day or two, but fans of action adventure games will find enough to love in the game's overall design to make it worth purchasing.			"

												Not bad!I actually got this game way back in the day when it first came out, but only now got around to playing through it. The gameplay still holds up after all this time, but keep in mind that you'll need to download a few user hacks/patches to get things up and running. Just look around on the Steam forums for those. Otherwise, the sound is great, the gameplay is interesting and fun, and the visual design is pretty good. Story is a little bland, but that's the only thing I can really harp on for this game. 100% completion took about 9 hours. At $10, this is definitely worth it.7.5/10			"

												NOTE: I have played for twelve hours (as of writing, I am playing more)... for some wierd reason Steam does not realize that.I was skeptical of this game when I first tried it out. But it grew on me quite fast. BG&E puts a lot of small detail into the world you are in, has fun mele, exploration, and financial elements. It has lovable characters and an engaging plot. It certaintly deserves more attention.Of course, it is not perfect, and several gameplay elements (especially some mini games) could be best removed from the game. Besides them, it is really engaging.A fantastic yet sadly overlooked title. IMPORTANT: Get the Steam version WITH CAUTION. I had a lot of technical difficulties running this game at first, so you may have similar problems. For help with any technical difficulties, the forums are a wonderful place to go. They helped me make this game work. However the problems are substantial, so I would reccomend getting the GOG version of the game instead if possible.			"

												The Steam Overlords want recommendations.  But hey, that's fine, because an excuse to promote this game is welcome.Don't be fooled by the somewhat retro graphics... this is a near perfect game.  It's a mixture of combat and steatlh, both quite satisfying.  The stealth elements are really good... you have to sneak past soldiers, though if your timing is good you can fight them or incapacitate them.  The situations get harder as you go; they can be quite tense.Plus there's, well, all kinds of stuff along the way: a chase scene, hovercraft battles and races, air hockey, photography.  None of these feel like ""mini-games"" (except maybe the air hocky, but it's fun)-- they add variety without taking you out of the game.Plus Jade is cute.Go buy it so they keep working on the sequel.

												I first found Beyond Good & Evil as a used PS2 game in a Blockbuster and thought it looked interesting. The cover art was intriguing, and the basic description caught my attention. However, the first few times I tried to play the game, I could not get through it because I did not have the patience to solve some of the challenges. Then one day in college, I picked it up over a weekend, deciding to play for the heck of it and to finish it once and for all. Am I glad I did.The game immerses you in the story from the get-go, forgoing the typical long, drawn-out backstory. The characters are warm and engaging, and all of them, major and minor, are full of depth and life. This is the only game that can honestly make me say I was sad to leave the world when I completed it, and it is the only game I can pick up once every few months and play again, even though I already know the answers to all of the puzzles and where to find all of the hidden items. So imagine my heartbreak when my PS2 copy started to glitch each time I started a new file, and my joy finding that it is available on Steam for only ten dollars!This game was well-thought out and developed, and I can say without a doubt that it is my favorite game. I am proud to own both the original PS2 copy and now to own it on Steam.			"

												It's hard to put into words how wonderful this game is. The gameplay is varied and exciting, the characters and world are wonderfully crafted, the plot is satisfying, and the music is profound. But it's greater than the sum of its parts, and most importantly, you truly care about what happens. The character development and writing are some of the best and most indelible in recent memory. Its exquisite mix of the whimsical and the sincere results in something beautiful and memorable. Highly, highly recommended.			"

												Beyond Good & Evil is one of the finest titles released by Ubisoft. Although it sold poorly at launch the game has since developed a sizeable following. Don't be fooled, the game's cartoony visuals belie a plot rife with conspiracy and social and political intrigue. The characters are surprisingly well-written. Jade, the game's protagonist, is notable as much for what she is as what she isn't. Jade is one of the few female leads that isn't overlty sexualized, often a problematic of video game writting. Rather, she is intelligent, strong, compassionate and unpretentious, a true everyman. In terms of gameplay, Beyond Good & Evil is a blend of action, adventure and stealth. What further sets it apart is its incorporation of photography into the plot and gameplay, breaking up the action and moving the plot forward throughout the experience. Certainly, fans of action-adventure games will find something to love about Beyond Good & Evil.			"

												So I was happy to find out that this game held up well, despite it's age. I had started it as a kid on my gamecube but had lost the disc before I ever finished it. I somewhat binged on this game, I'll admit. I know it wasn't all nostalgia, this game is just good. It reminds me of all the fun I ever had playing older games on console like OOT. You want to know the best part? It's one of the very few games where a woman is the strong lead character, the trope is reversed in this game. Jade is well written and intelligent, with many skills. If you want to play something a bit different, with a fun story with gameplay that's challenging but not frustrating, pick this up.			"

It still looks great for a game over a decade old, the soundtrack is fantastic, the characters have a ton of personality, good voice acting, and the story is pretty engaging. The gameplay is really solid and has quite a bit of variation between combat, stealth, exploration, racing, minigames, etc. You'll probably only get 8-10 hours out of a playthrough but personally I prefer a short, focused game to one that it padded with 20 hours of tedious repetition. Had a bit of trouble with graphics flickering but the forum had a fix that took me about 5 minutes to find.			"

												Beyond Good & Evil puts you in the role of Jade, a young woman who, along with her humanoid pig uncle Pey'j, runs a lighthouse on the planet Hillys. Hillys is at war with an alien force known as the DomZ, and an elite squadron known as the Alpha Sections protects Hillys from the alien threat. Or does it? An underground rebel organization known as the IRIS Network charges that the Alphas control both sides of the equation. IRIS is essentially a rogue news network, informing the people via a newsletter that strives to expose the link between Hillys' protectors and the alien menace. That's where Jade, a photographer-for-hire when not tending to the lighthouse, comes in. You quickly hook up with IRIS and spend the bulk of the game infiltrating Alpha strongholds.But you won't go at it alone. The game gives you a companion most of the time, and many puzzles will require you to get your associate to do things. Only one contextual button is used to command your companion, so it's usually pretty easy to get him to act. The AI of your partner is usually pretty good, but we occasionally had to backtrack to get him unstuck from walls or railings.Most of the game's interior sections have you out, on foot, and in search of photographic evidence. You're looking for specific pictures, and the areas of interest are marked on your map. The game does have combat, but it's a fairly straightforward system that suffices without excelling. The real meat of the gameplay comes from its puzzle-solving, though there's a little too much repetition in the puzzles, which can make some sections of the game feel pretty tedious. Almost every room will require you to do a little thinking. Sometimes it's as easy as using your projectile attack to push a button on the other side of a force field. Sometimes you'll have to find fuses in other parts of an installation to power elevators or other equipment. Sometimes you'll have to learn a password to proceed into a locked area. And there's a whole lot of sneaking around.In Beyond Good & Evil, stealth is treated much like the rest of the game's puzzles. You simply want to get to the next room, but patrolling guards are in the way. So you'll either have to avoid detection by staying out of sight or incapacitate the guards by blinding them with a well-placed shot to the tank on their backs. A guard can repair another guard's faulty tank, so in rooms with multiple guards, you'll have to either be a fast shot or find a quieter way through. The game's 10- to 15-hour quest also has you piloting a hovercraft, which is your primary mode of transport on Hillys. The Hovercraft can shoot, and you'll upgrade it over time to fire more powerful blasts, as well as give it the ability to jump. Upgrading your Hovercraft requires you to spend pearls at an upgrade shop. Pearls are fairly rare on Hillys and you'll get them in various ways ( for example  by defeating bosses or purchasing them from seedy merchants using credits, the game's main currency which you can earn by defeating enemies, find them in crates or by taking photos of the different animals in the game).The game controls quite well with a mouse and keyboard, using fairly standard third-person action game controls that are, of course, fully configurable.While the game behind the presentation is pretty good on its own, the entire package benefits from some pretty nice audio and video. The game is graphically impressive. The world of Hillys is beautifully rendered. It's large and atmospheric, and the outdoor segments show off some nice-looking water. The interior of the buildings you'll be infiltrating are appropriately dark and intimidating, with a hefty dose of effective lighting. The game's shadows usually look great, as well, though we noticed a couple of instances of shadows being unnaturally cast on walls and ceilings. It's a minor point, for sure, but given how amazing the rest of the game looks, little things like that tend to stick out. While the console versions of the game look outstanding in their own right (played on Nintendo Gamecube), the PC version definitely has a sharper, cleaner look to it. The water effects, well-placed blur effects, reflections, textures, and models really jump off the screen.While the game's repetitive nature and short length take away from its overall impact, Beyond Good & Evil is a fantastic-looking game that tells its story well. It may be short enough to complete in a day or two, but fans of action adventure games will find enough to love in the game's overall design to make it worth purchasing.			"

												Not bad!I actually got this game way back in the day when it first came out, but only now got around to playing through it. The gameplay still holds up after all this time, but keep in mind that you'll need to download a few user hacks/patches to get things up and running. Just look around on the Steam forums for those. Otherwise, the sound is great, the gameplay is interesting and fun, and the visual design is pretty good. Story is a little bland, but that's the only thing I can really harp on for this game. 100% completion took about 9 hours. At $10, this is definitely worth it.7.5/10			"

												Half of the reason I bought this on Steam was to play back through it again.  The other half was so that I could recommend it.This one ranks right up there with Psychonauts as a fantastic, critially-acclaimed action-adventure romp that did not get the fanfare it deserved on its original release.  Like Psychonauts, it's not perfect; it's got its share of finicky controls, awkward combat and rebellious cameras, but the overall experience is well worth the trip.The original release did have a potentially game-breaking bug in one spot, but the fan-made patches to fix it are still available on the Internet if you happen to get stuck. (I'm not sure, but this version may or may not have been patched to prevent it.)  There's also a point-of-no-return that might frustrate you if you're shooting for 100% completion. (Hint: It's right after you buy the last part for your craft.)In short: It's cheap!  Buy it!			"

												This game is just awesome it has it all, 3D platforming, 3rd person melee combat, first person shooting (via a weapon you pick up later in the game), puzzle solving, hovercraft racing (imagine a very cut down 'Wipeout' and you're close), flying sections, space combat sections.......it's a total package. There are stealth elements here, as well as side quests and a nicely evolving story line. The graphics though a few years old still look pretty nice in my opinion. I have played this game from start to finish 3 times, the only other game in recent memory that I have played that much is Half Life 2. So I would place this game in some highly esteemed company.On the down sides are that it can be a bit grindy (collecting items for ship upgrades), and in some situations the controls can be frustrating but in the main they work well.

												The gameplay was enjoyable even though I'm not a huge fan of games with stealth elements. There were quite many mini-games as well, which were fairly enjoyable too. The story was good and I will probably get the sequel, if it ever comes out on PC (currently in development for the next generation of consoles). Only real downside was the length of the game since I beat the game in about 11 hours and I collected and did everything during that time. There were only 3-4 quite lengthy missions in the game, each with a boss in the end.The game is kinda old though and doesn't work that well on modern computers. There were some graphical glitches at first but with a little bit of tweaking, I managed to make them disappear.Overall the game was good and I recommend playing it to everyone who likes stealthy action-adventure games.

												I had originally purchased this game shortly after it was released on Playstation 2. Tragically, I could never make a dent of progress in the game at the time because I didn't have a memory card for quite awhile. Nearly 10 YEARS went by before I saw this familiar face on Steam and decided to experience the game once and for all..and I am SO glad I did. Beyond Good & Evil is a great example of how a game with a simple story doesn't need violence, sexy aliens, or DLC to compete with today's sci-fi genre games. Instead- charming characters, beautiful music, gorgeous art style that has aged very well considering the advances in tech. A good portion of the game focuses on stealth aspects, though not as hardcore as the average -I CAUGHT YOU, YOU DEAD! game. Jade is one cool girl: she has a talking pig uncle, cares for orphans, full of energy and charisma that make her a believable character. Armed with only a staff, projectile launching glove, and a camera Jade must uncover the big secrets- about her planet Hillys, the alien race that seeks to harm them, as well as  a stunning introspection of herself.

												I call this game the original Mirrors Edge. An amazing storyline, amazing concept, utterly unique (especially for it's time!), but ♥♥♥♥♥♥ marketing. Thanks to that last slipup, this game was a sleeper hit, so not many people were really aware of this one until after the three month marketing was done. However! I preordered it when nintendo power bragged about it. Was never regretting that one. This game is deep, and I mean DEEP. One of the first great conspiracy stories in video games, expertly told with an underground, veneer peeling vibe. Not to give anything away, but the light and colorful starting world goes far beyond itself, showing how everything truly is. As philosophical as the title book was (Nietzche, don't get much more philosophical!), this story hits pretty close. But for you gameplay oriented people out there, this game is still good. It takes a bit of time to get used to antiquated controls and glitches, as this game was FAR smaller than most modern ones, but it created many of the engines later used. The camera support is very nice, the combat is fairly set up (but simple), but the majority of the game relies on caring about the world and the story, so if you like a good tale? Play this game.

												One of the coolest and most engrossing games I've ever played. The more you play it, the darker it gets. Don't let the cartoony graphics and characters fool you - there is depth, heart, and great storytelling to be found in this under-the-radar gem. One of the best and most enjoyable games I've ever played. I re-visit it almost every year.			"

												I don't know if you could call this a review as it is mostly my own personal opinion about this game.I played this game when I was around 12-13 years old and I still enjoyed it a lot, maybe even more, when I played it just now! Sure the graphics are outdated and some other things are not working as well as today's games but I still think this game is one of the best games that Ubisoft has ever made story-wise. I really like the open-world gameplay it has to it and the stealth parts are really working well too.Even though the graphics are a bit old I highly recommend playing it.			"

												If you like Zelda or, if you've never played on a console, Darksiders, this is a must have title. Great action adventure with lovable characters and a great story. It mixes combat with puzzles and racing and along the way you have the ability to search for pearls and take photos of different creatures. The graphics still hold up to this day and the game has a style of its own. It's fantastic !You shouldn't even be reading this, it's a game you should already own. But... if you still don't own it (naughty, naughty) you should get it immediately, it's really THAT good.[Rating: 92/100]			"

												One of the best games I've ever played..(If you just want to see my rating of this game, scroll right down to the bottom)I once bought this game, almost ten years ago retail. Never managed to finish it back then, cue to my computer crashing. The new one couldn't handle the disc..But now, steam has it, and I finally got to finishing it.Great story, great gameplay, has some stealth, racing, photographing, good dungeons, puzzle solving, amongst other things. It has some camera issues though, you might get annoyed by the fact that the camera is a bit hard to handle sometimes.Overall, I've had a great experience. The story and characters are all great and well-made, and the gameplay is well done although you might think ""photographing as a gameplay element, what?""It is a bit shorter than many modern day games though, since back then you couldn't fit all that much onto a disc so it couldn't grow as massive as it wanted. (what I mean is, don't expect a twenty-hour long odyssey from this, I got through the whole game in just seven hours).For those who may be wondering, this game does not have multiplayer, it is singleplayer only. Meaning no versus, co-op or other such things.However, it is a bit poorly ported to the newer OS-versions, meaning that it will probably not be fully functional straight-off. Graphical and sound issues are the most common problems, and for some users it doesn't even start. However, ti did start for me, and the graphics bugs I fixed by turning off ""HW vertex processing"" in the advanced settings of the game's startup menu. The sound issue I've heard is related to multi-core, and mostly fixed by telling the game to use only one core. Still, I would recommend that you turn on subtitles, just in case. (it doesn't always work flawlessly with the voice, occasionally some pieces have been known to disappear..)Still, though, a really great game. To summarise, you should really consider buying this straight up, right now, if you don't mind a few problems, many which are quite easily fixed for some people. Of course, since these bugs vary from player to player I cannot know which ones you are going to have (for me only the graphical issues, along with some occasional missing sound in dialogue or music, were present. The repeating voice bug, was not) so therefore I will not take these bugs into consideration when rating this.If I disregard the problems that arrived when getting this to newer OS, this would get a solid 9/10 from me.Updated to remove a spelling error.

												I really wanted to enjoy Beyond Good and Evil. I'd only ever heard stellar reviews of the game. The cast of characters seemed interesting and dynamic. The game's art style appeared to have aged well. Even while playing it, I absolutely loved the soundtrack.But the game falls apart mechanically. Maybe it's just because the game was originally designed for Xbox and Playstation, and the PC port didn't get the love it needed. Maybe it was the fact that I used a mouse and keyboard instead of a controller. Whatever the reason, the game really left me disappointed.The stealth sections are clumsy, the camera is uncooperative and sometimes totally unresponsive, the combat is repetative, and the platforming sections are dull. Beyond Good and Evil feels like it's aspiring to be an action-adventure game the likes of Zelda, but it trips over itself and seems to miss the mark.			"

												Beyond Good and Evil was the first game that I played. I got a second hand PS2 for my birthday, and my parents let me choose one game with it. I was totally new to video games and I had no idea which game I should choose, so I just let the store owner recommend me a game. And so Beyond Good and Evil it was. Luckily the game was in Dutch (my native language). I was around 10 years old back then, and I couldn't understand English. I started playing the game, not knowing what to expect at all. I remember that the game made a lot of impact on me. Of course, this could be because of the fact that this was my first game ever, but eight years later I can tell you that it wasn't just because of that. It was because of the astonishing music, the amazing atmosphere, and the feeling I got when I figured out how to complete a part of the game all by myself, after looking for a walkthrough on the internet. So now it's eight years later, I've probably completed over a hundred other games, great ones too, but Beyond Good and Evil always had a special place in my heart. I've replayed this game over 20 times, and a couple of days ago I bought the PC version too. Beyond Good and Evil will always be one of my most favourite games, and I can highly recommend this game to everyone.			"

												Contrary to what a lot of negative reviews are saying. I ran this on a Win 8.1 machine & had no issues with fast forwarding. I'm not saying that an issue does exist. I'm just saying this ran perfectly fine on my machine.Perfectly fine, with a couple exceptions. I had a crash to desktop right after finishing the final battle. I received the message ""No more memory"". This is odd as balls because my machine(like most out there today) is absolutely murdering the requirements. Memory wise I should have been able to run this game simultaneously MANY times over with little to no impact to my machine. Yet I still came up insufficient. This is just a minor annoyance, because on my next attempt, everything worked smoothly.I also encountered a few spots where the camera decided to be a complete d-bag & force me into a top down view or bottom up view, with no in between. This is not the smoothest of ports. & this issue was only compounded by the fact that I was using the ♥♥♥♥ poor Steam Controller. Putting those few issues aside. BG&E is a great game. If you have the option to play it on a console. DO THAT. If not this is a passable port if you can stomach a few minor irritations.			"

												+ fun camera mechanics to take pictuers of animals and monsters to earn credits and other currency+ for the most part, the stealth sections are pretty enjoyable and lenient+ great cast of characters+ music is varied and fun to listen to+ lots of stuff to find by exploring caves or locked doors around the town+ the game is VERY lenient on pearl acquisition. you'll need a butt load for some sections of the game and there are places to scrounge up quite a bit of them.+ story is fine. it's shallow but it gets the job done. it DOES do a good job as acting as a vehicle to give you more of a reporter/investigator role rather than pure combat.+ checkpoints are more than fair. Honestly you'll be saving to avoid the game crashing and losing progress as apposed to losing a fight. Dying in any room or fight usually just places you right before the encounter.- the most fighting you'll be doing in this game is against the camera. It's wonky, doesn't reset most of the time, and snaps you into awkward angles.- bugs. Jesus. This game is riddled with bugs. Sometimes its the AI partner freaking out but other times its more devious bugs like ""ran out of memory"" and you having to restart the game.- texture issues a plenty. I couldn't get the launcher to readjust and show me settings, so I had to live with my initial settings which had textures going bonkers throughout the whole game.- the cliffhanger...All in all it's something I think everyone should check out. The game itself is lots of fun but the running issues I noted above can slow your enthusiasm down.			"

												This game is a classic. What i got to play of it looked good, and i wish i could have played the game on steam like i had intended... anyways, on with the review.Havn't play much, and for good reason. List of issues i found within the first 15 minutes-- No mouse control for the menus - small but very annoying-- Game breaking graphical bugs that render the game unplayable - Bug and very annoying. The way to fix these is to fiddle with the options menu and disable some of the HD options added by Ubisoft. The options will not work, and only by disabling them will the game become playable. Notable features people had problems with are Shadow Detail (turn in down) and AA. Other features were found to cause problems for different systems.The only way to solve all your problems is to experiment in the out of game option menu.-- Tearing - This will happen after you mess with your options. There really is no avoiding it if you actually want to play the game without the visuals and sound being scrambled beyond recognition.-- ""Your graphics card is out of date"" - it just says this every time you open the game.Ok so let me elaborate on why I'm writing this. If you see this game on steam, DON'T buy it! Buy it on GOG.com if anything, because at least there you will get help with fixing the issues. They also give you the soundtrack of the game, a vertual game guide, and a few other goodies. Much better value. The reason the game is in this state is because Ubisoft is terrible at PC ports... but this should is criminal. They sell you a defective product and offer no help, patches, or fixes to do anything about it.			"

												First of all, don't purchase this game on Steam unless you still have a Windows XP gaming system. There are a multitude of technical issues that will likely make it unplayable for you. So if you have an old console lying around it was on just about all of them, or play it on an emulator, Dolphin worked perfectly.If you do put the effort into actually playing, there's not a lot to get excited about. Maybe it was a breath of fresh air in 2003 when it was released, but more than likely people only recommend it out of nostalgia.It does play smoothly, and the pacing is nice, with some varied gameplay mechanics. The characters and world are on the verge of being interesting and lovable, but never quite gel. The plot is pretty saturday morning cartoony, and not in a good way.If you, like me, wanted to check out a game touted as ""an underrated classic"", I couldn't blame you for feeling the need to see for yourself. But if you never end up playing it, you didn't miss anything.5.6/10			"

												Beyond Good and Evil is a 2003 Stealth Action-Adventure game developed by Ubisoft Montpellier, the studio behind the Rayman series and also responsible for original titles like From Dust. Montpellier, as a creative powerhouse, delivered Beyond Good and Evil to critical acclaim, but devastatingly poor sales have infamously seen the sequel perpetually delayed.This is a horrible port, and you should not buy it. Beyond Good and Evil is not a perfect game. This is the only version of it I've played, so my experience is not all encompassing. However, I felt that most, if not all, of the problem with the game stemmed from what a horrendous port this is. It controls absolutely awful, because for a game that is designed solely for gamepads, it dictates that you use the keyboard and mouse. Trying to steer Jade while clicking away in haphazard combos isn't fun at all, along with common mishaps like sticking to walls and desperately waggling the mouse in radial-based menus like an idiot. There is no gamepad support for this game whatsoever, outside of using a clunky 3rd-party program like Xpadder. So that means when the game restricts you camera to a 2D plane, you just have to deal with it. When it decides to wrench your camera away for you for no apparent reason, you just have to deal with it. When you're desperately wrenching the mouse while janking the hovercraft with the WASD keys to get it around corners, you just have to deal with it.Those are just the control issues. Even after disabling a certain amount of options to get the game running at above a powerpoint rate (note: simply lowering the settings made the game perform even worse) I had constant plummets in framerate and constant graphical glitches. This port (not by Montpellier) makes Ubisoft's recent debacles look good.It is, however, a decent game. The gameplay is shallow, and the amount of distractions in the disappointingly small hub-world one-note, but the game is carried by the amazing art style and music. The art style speaks for itself, and the music is worth tracking down if you can. While not sold on the game's cult classic status, the game is a solid casual Action Adventure that doesn't demand much in the way of attention and delivers on the premise plenty. I'm not recommending this, not because you shouldn't play this, but because you shouldn't play this version. Play the HD version, emulate a console version, by Jove even dig out a sixth gen system and track down a physical copy if you're truly dedicated to playing this game and seeing what the hype is all about.Playing the Steam version of Beyond Good and Evil will only sour you on an already hard to sell game.

												Good game, bad port.No controller support built in. It's not a port of the HD version from the 360. It's extremely buggy and requires a lot of work to get it playable.Even if they made a sequel, they would probably make it a UPlay exclusive...			"

												For the record, this is an already kind of iffy port of a console game that can run pretty poorly on some newer hardware. I've had a lot of trouble getting it to even run. Buyer beware. Game itself seems fun, but it might be more worthwhile to track down a console version if you have something to play it on (the 360 and PS3 HD versions seem to run fine, so maybe look into those).

												Cool game. Great visual aethestic. Very well designed world. Taking pictures of animals/people is great. The stealth sections are okay. The hack n slashy battles, honestly, aren't that great and for the most part unmemorable. If they do a sequel, they should remove either stealth or hack n slash and focus on making the other stronger. Collecting pearls and  mdisks is fun. The little diversions and sidequests like racing and the pallet game are good too. Its really the world and the diversions that make this game memorable.4/5			"

												Okay. This game, is always going to be ""home"" for me. I first got this for the PS2 when it first game out. (multiple times because I was a stupid kid who always lost her games lol) and I also had gotten it for xbox and now for pc! I will say, i got farther now in the PC version than I have previously. Although, this version (PC) Is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥. I love the game dearly, but the bugs, man. It's sometimes so, annoying and unbearable, but I love this game so i bite my tongue. Other than the bugs, I recommend this to people. The music is very relaxing. Storyline is rahter good. The characters are so cute(especially Pey'J. Bacon smellin' ♥♥♥♥.)

												Beyond Good and Evil is pretty much a hidden gem, imo. I was too young to really play it during its original run, but I heard some good reviews about it, so I decided to pick up the PC version to see what was up.Right off the bat, BG&E is definately a beautiful game for something from 2003; the artstyle kinda helped it to age a littttleee bit better. Also oh my god, the soundtrack. Good stuff. The game is ahort at about 8 to 10 hours if you just power through it, so it's definately a game I'd reccomend to people looking for something to spend a weekend with, but there is a bit of stuff for completionists to do, (namely snappig some pictures of Hillyan wildlife that you might notta caught the first time around, and searching for all the pearls in game) and for that, I'm actually gonna be playing this a second time through!Gameplay on foot consists of a lotttaaa stealth. I don't really find the combat to be something to really write home about, but there's a lot of varied gameplay going on like hoverboat races, and some chases on foot and in vehicle. Overall, the game kinda tries its hand at pretty much everything, which is admirable, but it makes it so nothing really is as stellar as it coulda been. Not saying it's bad, just some elements of gameplay are better than others and everyone's gonna kinda have some elements that pop out a lil more to them than others.Overall, good game with a lotta varied gameplay that makes the 8-10 hours you'll spend on just the campaign interesting with a distinct art style and an A+ soundtrack. If the store description or any gameplay footage piques your interest, you'll probably like Beyond Good and Evil. A word of warning though, it's glitchy on modern OS's, especially Windows 8 and 10. I personally made this more playable by running the .exe in compatibility mode set on XP service Pack 3, but stilllllll had some minor audio and graphical glitches. Community discussion page offers some more fixes if you're looking to get it a little closer to the original, but if you're not in the mood for fiddling around, there's and HD version on XBL and PSN~			"

												Admittedly, its been over a year since I last played, but I stopped because I just didnt find myself interested enough to play the game and I don't feel like resuming.  The game is old, so I don't really have any gripes with the graphics or aesthetics.  Characters are more or less well done, some are even actually pretty darn good.  As for the gameplay, I dunno, it just didn't grab me.  The combat was passable but not great, vehicle use was kind of annoying, and the stealth sections were even more so.  The story wasn't especially engaging either, and the photography angle seemed more like a minigame than an important game aspect.From what I understand it is a fan favorite, so by all means give it a try, but it just wasn't the game for me.

												Beyond Good & Evil is a wonderful game, but the Steam version lacks controller and widescreen support, and it's filled with bugs if you use Windows Vista, 7, or 8. I've only tested this version with Windows 7, but I've heard similar criticisms about the game experiencing problems on Windows Vista and I doubt it runs any better on Windows 8. If you want to play this game with controller and widescreen support in 1080p with far less bugs, I highly recommend checking out Beyond Good & Evil HD for the PS3 and Xbox 360. It has its issues, but you're likely to have a much better experience with it than this version. I've also heard the GOG version has less bugs for modern operating systems.			"

												First of all, the PC port is not great. You need to fiddle with the game quite a bit just to run it on a modern PC. Cutscene sound is badly out of sync and I've only managed to partially reduce the issue by limiting the game to one CPU core and running external applications to launch the game. You will also need to disable HW Vertex Processing in advanced graphics options to get rid of the flicker. It also seems that gamepads are not supported, but the M&K layout works just fine, though it's not entirely intuitive.The game itself feels very dates and doesn't seem to have aged well. The plot is ok, but not very fleshed out. A classic story of a protagonist with exceptional powers, the nature of which is only slightly hinted at at the end of the game itself. The world doesn't feel real.The controls are clunky, Combat mechanics are pretty bad. It's mostly a game about sneaking with combat being an annoying afterthought, until you get to fight the final boss.On the bright side, the checkpoints are reliably placed all over the place and you never have to backtrace to much.As a whole, I would recommend to watch the plot summary on YouTube and play something much more mechanically enjoyable.

												Fantastic game ruined completely by total trash final boss design. The fight is so grating and difficult for me that it's just about like chewing on concrete bricks. I loved the whole game up to that point too. I know some people may find it easy, but it was absolutely infuriating for me. Another game that I'll probably never finish.Edit: Turns out it wasn't my skills that were the problem, I evidently suffer from a game breaking glitch. So chalk up the cruddyness to a terrible port. I ended up just watching the end on YouTube, and as it turned out it wasn't worth it at all. It's so abrupt. I'm so disappointed right now.			"

												6/10.  The game is good in terms of plot, but once again, like Deep Space, I cannot give a thumbs up due to the controls on PC keyboard.  It became obvious that this is a controller game based on the way the character loses behind the shoulder pov and goes to side scroller type, making it extremely difficult to get the main character to perform as you want.  It doesn't mean it's impossible, it's merely frustrating as heck and required repeated plays in areas due to deaths that had nothing to do with fights.  I had to play the game in short bursts rather than enjoy it in consecutive sittings.  So you are warned about the controls before you choose to purchase the game to play with a PC Keyboard.   Pros:-Story-Length-Music-Jamaican RhinosCons:-Keyboard controls-Changing camera pov-Last boss fight with reverse controls and never-ending repeated hitting in a pattern (I clocked 31 times in a row with no effect before throwing in the towel.  If I happened to have had 99 K-lives as suggested before going into the final battle, maybe I would eventually have seen the end).			"

Every option higher than 60Hz is causing syncing problems. This game just isn't made for 144Hz. So solve any sync problem by putting frames per second on 60Hz. It's a great game that should get more appreciation in my opinion! If you already skipped this option, try setting your monitor to 60Hz, that works as well.			"

Interesting story and characters, good graphics (for the time), fun gameplay with a wide variety of gameplay mechanics...but that last point really falls apart considering this port has no controller support and forces you to play with keyboard and mouse which would be fine for a point and click game but for an action adventure game like this it's just an exercise in tedium.Damn shame...I'm not sure I'll finish the PC version.

												It's hard to recommend a good game that won't work on your computer. This game appears to be an old PC port of the game and has many graphic errors and is a pain to work with a controller. If you don't mind playing a good game with a lot of problems then buy away. If not then save your money and hope that Ubi actually provides the HD version of the game in the future.			"

												Obviously surprising to most readers of this review, I didn't like the game. Please read all of it before bashing it though. It seems like everybody and their mother claims this game to be one of the best and beg for a sequel. I disagree. I only finished the game for the first time, never played it before. Maybe if I played it when younger I'd have some nostalgic factor or something, but that wouldn't actually mean the game is good... because the game is just not that good.The game, first off, is really, really simple, which isn't something I mean negatively. There's many simple modern games I enjoy, like Fable, so that isn't a bad point. The problem is that all of the simple ""pieces"" don't really work as expected. Before getting into the game, just a quick brush on graphics and such, though those don't really sway my opinion of a game. The graphics weren't bad, rough in places, but overall pretty decent for years back. The sound, on the other hand, was only okay. People seem to love the soundtrack, but all in all it was pretty average and had nothing exciting.The only song that stood out to me was out on the sea early in the game, the peaceful one reused at the beginning of the credits. It was really nice and I loved that one. Besides songs, the dialogue was decent. Audio sync didn't really cause many problems for me, only once or twice.Now, onto the game. The characters were all lackluster. I didn't really care about any of them, even the kids. The only one I liked was Pey'j. Jade didn't really stand out as a special protagonist, though I did feel a little twinge at a couple places near the end (mostly due to Pey'j). The kids were really only used at the beginning and end... and the same goes for Secundo. And Double H was sooooooo annoying. I really, really hated him. His voice and style was the most generically annoying possible.When it came to the NPCs in terms of gameplay, it was a waste. They served virtually no purpose other than to move around a couple puzzles and to bash their special ability during combat. But they served to make combat more annoying. They just stood around, got attacked, and got pinned to the ground. I wanted to give them PA-1's, but I needed the health usually! Friendly fire made it worse, because they just stood in my way and often I would take off half a heart because they'd get hit.Boss fights weren't good except for the final two bosses. All of the others were so simple and easy that I beat them all in less than 90 seconds each, some even less than 1 minute, because most of them were usually bashing the same pattern without thought. The first boss you could even beat without being touched, and without any effort.The controls in the game were pretty wobbly, usually because of the camera, which would bounce around. In most of the levels, the confines were relatively cramped, so the camera bounced all over for me. I'd be seeing through walls or the ground, and could barely keep things focused. If you walk near certain walls, the camera would jump 180 degrees, so during combat, it was even more terrible. I'd often end up hitting random things or thin air.Stealth wasn't that special. It was semi-enjoyable, but in some places the controls and camera made it worse. In one level (I think the Slaughterhouse? Or the one before it), there was sneaking through a foggy area, but it took me several tries to get through. It was really simple in idea, but my camera got stuck and I was always looking into the ground and at Zoey, all in the fog, so I could see nothing. It kept moving even if I centered the camera, so I could barely see the enemies. Other places were relatively annoying too, and all in all it just wasn't that fun or special.The story was pretty generic, really. Oh no, people are betrayed and getting abducted by aliens? That's pretty much all it amounted to the entire game, except for the last 5 minutes. But because I lost interest by that point, the last 5 minutes of revealings didn't make me care any more or want a sequel. The aspect of using a camera as a special spy was interesting at first, but everything was generally repetitive, so nothing special.Lastly, exploration was a bummer. I expected there to be a bit more to the world. I didn't expect something crazy... but there really wasn't much at all. The 4 races, meh. The 4 looter's caverns, meh. I mean, I did them all, and they were okay, but not much else opened up in the world as the game progressed. Only a couple more dungeon-like areas, but most were short.And the biggest annoying part of that... the city. I really, really liked the looks of the city going into it at first. I expected it to open up more throughout the game and was excited about it. You get a city pass and I thought, finally! But you move like 50 more feet and hit another wall. So basically, for a decently-sized city, you get to explore none of it. They could have really made it bigger. A few alleys was really disappointing.Anyway, everything culminated into a disappointment. I'm not complaining because of overhyping; I'm just stating that the game was generally flawed in almost all of its aspects. I have absolutely no desire to replay it, while there are many other games I have replayed or will replay through the years.			"

												This game is often mentioned as something special, and maybe it is, but ubisoft wont make it easy for you or me to find out.It seems they've put this game on steam 'as-is', one would assume as a cash grab. They have not updated it for modern HW at all! If your GFX card is younger than 10 years, or you have more than one cpu core (including HT) expect lots of problems; such as slowdowns, texture glitches, and the sound being out of sync with the action/video.There are lots of posts about this easily found with google. Two solutions often come up that help a little: 1) set CPU affinity to just one CPU core (done with taskman), 2) Set GFX features to manual and turn most things off (google for specifics). oh and you will never be able to get rid of the warning about your GFX drivers being too old.Steam does not know how many hours I've played because I start the game outside of steam with a .bat script, that tries to adjust some things for the game. I am some hours in and I can appreciate the charm that this games had and I can see why it's so beloved.Unfortunately unless I can get it to play smothly (i.e. Ubisoft fixes the game), I am not sure I will ever love it.If you want to play it, I'd suggest finding a 10 year old laptop with winxp to play it on. A real shame...			"

Besides, I'm too old for all the 'kiais' and the jumping and kicking and racing and shooting and spinning in the air, soundtracked by that gym-workout music in the background...

												Aesthetics and music are top notch. The story is so-so.However, I must say that the core gameplay is either mediocre or downright annoying. Most of it is thanks to the camera. What happens is that, in some sections (combat & stealth), the camera is fixed at an angle, but you can still move it inside its axis. This creates a few undesirable situations, where you're fighting multiple enemies and the camera keeps snapping forward, or the camera angle doesn't actually show what's ahead (in stealth sections). The main problem is that your controls change when the camera changes, so an abrupt change can make the camera keep snapping forward and backwards, making you run up to enemies you don't want to fight.The stealth gameplay in this is very simple. Enemy saw you? Run to another room. Got into a fight with patrols? Pray the camera doesn't keep getting in your way.The story starts pretty good, but after mid-point, I realized everything was being rushed towards the ending. I didn't really like it.The ""open world"" aspects are almost nil, and the game is rather short. It has 2 ""big"" areas where you'll spend most of your playtime in, then a very small stealth section, and finally the last stage, which is awfully paced (a few empty corridors and easy puzzles), probably because of the rushed ending.All in all, the game is rather entertaining, but beware of its cons.

												A fantastic, if overrated game. It's certainly not the ""best game ever"" or anything, despite what the cult following would say; but still, it's a solid adventure game in the veins of Okami, the Legend of Zelda or Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy. Definately worth a try if you either enjoy Zelda-style adventures, or haven't gotten sick of them yet.However, this PC port is very old, very outdated, and has extreme difficulties running on modern hardware; errors such as forced 4:3, abysmal framerates, and constantly flickering textures and massive letterboxing making the game feel unplayably poor.Available for free on Uplay, so not really worth purchasing here. Try either that, or the HD collection on 360/PS3.			"

												I first played it whe it came out for the PS2 more than a decade ago and since then play through it once every year or two.To this day it still remains one of my favorite games. It has an excellent story and a very fun gameplay.Hopefully BG&E2 is still happening and isn't going to take very much longer. "

												Very nice rpg / adventure game. Game mechanics are simple, characters are interesting and fun, plot isn't most complicated but keeps you hooked, no unnecessary grinding, not that many side quests either...Graphics wise some could say it's outdated, which it propably is, but I'd say it makes it slightly cartoonish feeling in it and it fits. Originally made for console, or at least UI feels like so, but it's not really a problem...Very nicely done, some flaws, but nothing to stop get you hooked in the game. Definitely worth a buy, if not with full price, from sale at least.			"

												I am in love with this game since I was 12 and also in love with Jade, main heroine. It can be summarized as classic action adventure situated in relatively open world. You can race in hovercrafts, fights monsters, stealth around in secret factories, seek pearls to upgrade your vehicle and so much more. But remember, you are photographer, so take pictures of all animal species on planet to earn money. This game has soul. Ubisoft, make sequel already!			"

												Great atmosphere, once you get past the somewhat lacking controls and perhaps some graphical issues, I must say I got hooked for hours. It's a great mix of point and click adventuring, some platforming and mostly basic fighting (so far) like stuff seen in jack and daxter, or zeldaish with a lock on system.But my main reason why I'd recommend this to anyone is the music, and the characters. The music is varried and intresting, and the same could be said about most characters I have had the joy to interact with.			"

Those games that you can't really remember ever being advertised, yet your friends that have played them swear that those games are the greatest things since someone slathered tomato paste and cheese over bread before baking it.Beyond Good & Evil is one of those games, and when I finally played it for the first time, it completely blew me away.  Sure, it may be dated compared to some of the gems out now, and good lord, getting it to play just right on computers these days cam be a mite... tricky.

												Great game that I regret waiting so long to play. The story though not revolutionary is solid and pretty straightforward minus the somewhat out of nowhere twist. The characters are all amusing and good fun though double h gets a little annoying at times. Overall the game can be beat in under 14 hours if you're going for completion, 6-8 if you just plow through it.Pros- Simple and easy to understand combat system- Minigames and photography are fun and have a good vary of difficulty without being unfair- A fun break from larger 40+ hour titlesCons- Very rarely controls do tend to not respond correctly- The camera. It works well minus a few sections where it snaps around.- No gamepad support. Used Xpadder. (This con is for those who prefer controller for adventure platformers)			"

												I played this game on PS2 when I was like 10 and even at this time, I could feel that this was a freakin' awesome game.Seriously, even if, for me, BGE lacks of playing time, this is a true fascinating experience.I don't even want to say more as there is too much to tell.Try it yourself, you won't be disappointed.

												Aside from the crappy PC controls, this game is outstanding. It reminds me of an Indiana Jones adventure in that there's a lot of variety. Problem-solving, melee combat, treasure-hunting, racing, vehicle combat, stealth, and an excellent story - this game has everything. It reminds me of the grandfather in ""The Princess Bride"" talking about all of the perks of the story.It's a shame it didn't do well back in 2003; otherwise, we may have seen a sequel or two. Awesome game, to which I attribute the value of 1,337 brapples.			"

												Beyond Good and Evil is a fantastic game that runs horribly on modern computers. At first I experienced lots of graphical glitches, input lag and delay and was going to include complaints regarding that in the review but it was easily fixed. I had already played the game on PS2 but decided to buy this on a sale. It does look great in higher (than 640x480) resolutions but I couldn't seem to get it to run in 16:9 properly.

												Fun game, interesting mechanics, ♥♥♥♥ camera control and movement, not a deal breaker unless you're easily annoyed  by that sort of thing, it's a console port so only allows saving at specific location which are fairly common, more common than the houses in GTA San Andreas but still annoying when you're in a hurry to quit the game. bit out of date with the graphics card recognition but nothing game breaking, a few graphical glitches here and there but nothing that has stopped progress or my enjoyment.Very gated story progression  though, gotta have enough pearls to buy the upgrades, take the right pictures first before you can get.Some times a bit vague about how things work, like the inventory and swapping upgrade items between characters.One of those games where you should really have the manual handy for some tips and tricks.I reccomend the use of a controller/gamepad.Use your ""it's an old game"" standards and you'll have a fun time without getting hung up on its technical limitations.

												One of my fav games of all time. It starts off a little weird, but then quickly becomes entertaining with a fairly interesting story full with adventure and conspiracy. It has an epic musical score and great gameplay. This game got me into photography, because part of the game is to earn money by making pictures of animals. This by itself makes the game fun enough to play, but there is plenty of fighting and sneaking if you are in to that sorta thing too. BG&E has some mini games in a bar that are really fun and sometimes I still listen to the song being played there. The bad thing about the game is the final boss tho, its a pain in the ♥♥♥ to kill. The final bad thing is that it is by UBISOFT, which always ♥♥♥♥s gamers over with DRM (I couldnt play this from the DVD only because the DRM does not work with anything above windows 2000!

Game mechanics are simple, characters are interesting and fun, plot isn't most complicated but keeps you hooked, no unnecessary grinding, not that many side quests either...Graphics wise some could say it's outdated, which it propably is, but I'd say it makes it slightly cartoonish feeling in it and it fits. Originally made for console, or at least UI feels like so, but it's not really a problem...Very nicely done, some flaws, but nothing to stop get you hooked in the game.

												I like to think of myself as an awful and hateful person with no chance of being loved or loving anything, but I find myself almost feeling for Jade.  Seriously volks, this game is great!  I think Mossberg Ocelot said it best in MGS 9: Snakes Load, ""This game is the best game ever!""  In this rod-awesome zelda improvement you play as Jade, a totally hot muloto girl with a weave who takes pictures for everyone and runs an Orphanage, being an orphan myself im a little bias on that part.  One day her planet is attacked by evil aliens, whom have been attacking forever but they did it again right when her orphanage shields when down.  Well fearing a goverment cover up and a alliance with the aliens by her planets government she decided to save her Orphans and her ZUN ZUN Paige, which oddly looks a lot like me IFL.  So if you havent played this game youre a fat idiot who needs to die, and if youve never finished the first part, youre just as fat and should get ring worm.  PLAY THIS GAME NOW!			"

If you want to buy project bg&e (the name of the project before we knew the official name) for pc I highly recommend to go to this page  http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Beyond_Good_%26_Evil  to set up the game. This port is pretty sloppy with flickering textures alore wich really made me very disspaointed and anry on how they didn't pay respect to this gem BUT with these fixes it's close to the original ,if you have a xbox or a  ps3  i beg you to buy it there they released a HD version on those systems , a gamecube or ps2 is still the best shot but good luck finding a working copy.Overall this is one those games wich were loved by the critics and fans but for stupid reasons like letting it compete with other ubisoft franchises like prince of persia who were already estabelished.

												88/100 Overall, this is a good game. It has unique gameplay, stealth, puzzles, really fun mini games (like racing and a futuristic version of air hockey), a good blend of sci fi / fantasy, fun combat (staff, ranged, boat, aerial), an awesome soundtrack, a story with heart but also one that is filled with twists and turns. And, the graphics are good especially considering that this was originally a PS2 game, that was later updated to HD textures. Cons: Not really any, it's good for a console port, but I did miss basic key mapping. & there were a few other minor technical issues (such as the options slider for volume control, not saving properly). Finally, if you enjoy games like Legend of Zelda you might enjoy this game as well as parts of the game were like throw backs to Ocarina of Time. That said it was neat.			"

												Very nice rpg / adventure game. Game mechanics are simple, characters are interesting and fun, plot isn't most complicated but keeps you hooked, no unnecessary grinding, not that many side quests either...Graphics wise some could say it's outdated, which it propably is, but I'd say it makes it slightly cartoonish feeling in it and it fits. Originally made for console, or at least UI feels like so, but it's not really a problem...Very nicely done, some flaws, but nothing to stop get you hooked in the game. Definitely worth a buy, if not with full price, from sale at least.			"

												Great game that I regret waiting so long to play. The story though not revolutionary is solid and pretty straightforward minus the somewhat out of nowhere twist. The characters are all amusing and good fun though double h gets a little annoying at times. Overall the game can be beat in under 14 hours if you're going for completion, 6-8 if you just plow through it.Pros- Simple and easy to understand combat system- Minigames and photography are fun and have a good vary of difficulty without being unfair- A fun break from larger 40+ hour titlesCons- Very rarely controls do tend to not respond correctly- The camera. It works well minus a few sections where it snaps around.- No gamepad support. Used Xpadder. (This con is for those who prefer controller for adventure platformers)			"

												Excellent world building, cool story telling, awesome protagonist and dialogues, and just a very fun game overall.The one big problem I see with this game is the awful camera control. It really is a constant obstacle and tends to ruin the good feel of stealth and combat mechanics. It's an understandable limitation of the time it was produced, but if you have no patience for this sort of stuff this probably won't work for you.Also, on the technical side: I had to use a fix to get the image ratio to work properly on my monitor, and throughout the game texture glitches tended to happen regularly. I also kind of assumed that controllers would be supported, which is not the case, so don't overlook that fact.			"

												Would like to enjoy this game but it's junk on PC. No native controller support. No windowed. If you run it in DXWnd, the mouse doesn't stay inside the window for camera control, so that get's weird fast. Always asks for driver updates, even though the game came out in '03. Texture problems. Anti-Aliasing settings can screw you up. Not made to run on multicore. Have to find ways to make it run on just one. Steam doesn't recognize game-time if you open it in DXWnd.

												Beyond Good and Evil is hands down, an all-time favorite game from my childhood. What immediately grabbed my attention was the art-style and the music. Even after finishing the game multiple times, I often find myself listening to the soundtrack.The characters in the game are wonderfully done (in my opinion), including the two companions whom join you on your mission. A bonus was that I never had to run around looking for them, only to find them stuck on an obstacle or anything like that. Even while progressing, collecting all of the pearls and playing the mini-games are fun distractions too.I did have a few issues with glitchy textures and whatnot, but the forums quickly fixed the issue and I was able to play it within a few minutes. The only thing I'll half heartedly complain about is the semi-wonky camera. It can be a bit annoying to maintain in the Beluga, and I had it get stuck once or twice. The few times the camera got stuck on walls, I was easily able to fix it without having to restart the game or losing any progress. As for the vehicle; I doubt it'll work for everyone, but I stopped having issues with it while driving if I didn't move the camera with my mouse.Something I'm saddened by is how little commercial success this game received. That, and the fact that apparently this was the first installment in what was supposed to be a trilogy. The sequel was originally revealed in 2008, had a video leaked in 2009, and was announced to still be in development in 2011 and 2012. Interestingly, a poster of Beyond Good and Evil 2 concept art of Jade was shown in 2013. I'm unsure if anything else has been announced, leaked, or otherwise, but I personally still have my fingers crossed for the sequel.			"

												One of the few good heroines in a game ever. The game has great cartoonish design, nice music, it feels very French (in a good way!). Exploring the world and snapping photographs are the highpoints, the sneaking sections are the worst.

												Expect 10 hours of game, give or take. Old game, it shows on animation quality and graphics/textures, but it compensates with a nice art style, likeable characters and although not mindblowing but solid story. Game convines actions scenes with stealth and some puzzle solving. None is extremly polished or hard but they all work well togheter without interrupting the flow of the game (something many modern games seem to have forgotten). The reporter theme is refreshing. Only annoying thing is the hovercraft sections because that thing handles erraticaly, but it can be solved by usind the ''compass'view.I don't think the game is the so called masterpiece, but it is a nice game which i would recommend. Would like a sequel too.			"

												In how many games can you be a photojournalist who exposes the horrifiic truth behind so called benevolent protectors? The photography that the game centers around is so well implemented that everything you do - including snapping pictures of animals that would normally be tedious - is just so natural. Everything about the protagonist is awesome, and the writing really makes you feel for her. The stealth sections get tedious and the camera and movement is dated, but hell it's worth playing. This game has gotten the following it has for a reason, and the price it's at these days is a steal.			"

												Beyond Good and Evil is a fabulous work of art that originally was released for the PS2, GC, Xbox, and those early 2000's pcs.  The game's story is amazing backed up by emotional moments, compeiling characters, and the need to find out just who is really orchestrating the DomZ attacks and who is kidnapping the citizens of Hillys.  Furthermore is the graphics, I don't tend to focus on graphics much, but, Beyond Good and Evil deserves for its graphics to be praised for a world that draws you into it beauty and to this day has aged quite well.  And the music fits every mood rather it be a tough boss battle or sad cutscene.  Gameplay is also solid--Jade's movements in battle always feel smooth and well executed.  Perhaps the most interesting thing I thought about the gameplay was how it combined not just the action adventure of a Zelda game, but the stealth you would find in such as Metal Gear.  Now there are some issues with this game I should address but shouldn't stop you from playing the game.  One, is that the game has not been optimized for modern day pcs, in fact as soon as you start the game you are given an error that your 'Graphics Card' has not been updated to the latest version, but at least you can still play it.  Then theres problems with sometimes flickering graphics and such, and one of the worst that ruined a very important scene in the game near the end was at the middle of the cutscene the sound absolutely stopped (I had to reload an earlier save, turn on subtitles and go through it again just to hear them).  In other words this game is a straight out port of the pc version that has not been optimized for modern day pcs.  But even though it has issues with modern day pcs I found that it was still enjoyable as it was back when it was released.  I suggest Ubisoft releases a patch so that Beyond Good and Evil can run on modern day pcs better, much better.  If you can deal with the issues then you will certainly have a blast playing this overlooked great game.  However if you don't want to deal with the issues then I suggest you buy the HD version on Xbox 360 or PS3. "

The side activities to collect money and pearls are fun and you need to do some of them to progress but it does not force you to do all of them which could get tedious.

												I've wanted to play this game for a long time and this was the first time I've actually played through it. I really enjoyed it. The story, music, and world were a joy to experience and it's nice to play a game with the early aughts levity that you so seldom get in current games. Now, would I recommend this for the PC? ....Not necessarily, it is horribly ported. Every time I launched the game it said my graphics card drivers were out of date (they weren't) Apparently, if you run this on a newer machine, the game can't recognize your graphics card and will just pop that error up every time you launch. You can click through it to boot the game up, though. Before you do that, I would suggest going into the advanced settings (not ingame), going into the manual compatibility settings and disabling HW Vertex Processing: it's job is to bug your game out with random polygons and artifacts that make the game unplayable. From what I've read, this happens to a lot of people.Another problem with the port, this game was designed for a controller, yet there's no controller support. If you're like me, you're going to need to faff about extensively with the control settings to get the game marginally comfortable to play. One thing that I couldn't fix was how both the mouse and WSAD keys sent the same commands when you're in a vehicle and it screws with the camera. All in all, while I got through the game fine enough, it felt like I was limping the whole way because of the poor controls.The game itself, though, was wonderful. As I took in the music, characters, and setting of the game I was sad that this never got the trilogy it promised to be. It's got a little of everything in it, stealth, action, vehicles, mini-games, puzzles, NPC interaction; its really remarkable that all of this was in it way back in the early 2000's and I felt the experience actually aged quite well. The lightly cartoony look did the game well and avoided the ""super realistic"" games pitfal of looking and playing like ♥♥♥ now. It probably won't happen, but here's to hoping for that sequel to wrap things up!			"

												This is an awesome game. Just first hour in and I was surprised. I just don't like the fact that they will throw the plot at you at the very beginning in a very short narrative, but that's just me. :D This is the first time I'll be playing it, I hope there's more to this.			"

												Good story with likeable characters. Decent length. Semi-open world with many side quests, optional areas, upgrades, etc. Worst camera in any game I've ever played. Bad finnicky combat with poor dodging, also ruined by camera. Mediocre finnicky stealth sections also ruined by bad camera. Bad final boss fight. Game forces repetitive grinding of collectibles in order to continue, used to inflate playtime. Some of worst vehicle controls of any game I've ever played. Controller use not possible, which is sad in 2016. Use of camera item is a nice touch.  Gameplay is rather varied too, which is rare for game of this length. That game is enjoyable sometimes, but frustrating others. The awful camera, bad combat and mediocre stealth, and bad vehicle controls show the clunkiness of the 2003 systems. Some people really love this game, but I believe some of that is they are looking through rose-tinted glasses. Worth a look on the cheap, but know what you're getting into. 7.5/10 "

												Recently finished this for the first time. Ended up playing and enjoying it more than I thought I would. The colorful world and captivating story helped me enjoy the game more than anything. The locale and activities were interesting to explore and interact with and gave a lot of life to the world. I really liked the puzzle platforming style. It felt intuitive, but not overly complex or tedious. Although, some of it was pretty simple. Didn't really care for the combat system. Felt clunky and awkward on PC, but doable. The progession system wasn't too demanding and isn't completely necesary to survive most combat engagements, but it definitley makes the game way too easy. The most annoying sequence (for me) was the stealth parts. I ended up cheesing most stealth parts due to the awkward A.I. responses. Anyways, after playing this, I can finally join the rest of the fans hoping and praying for a sequel. I'd love to see a modern sequel with a more fleshed out story. I think the world of BG&E would look pretty tantalizing with todays graphics.  "

												THis game is a clasic i remember playing it on the game cube, it has a great storry and is chalenging enough to keep your attention and frusterations high, the only complaint i have is the final boss, and the way the story ended, The final boss is about a hundred thousand, times harder then any thing, else in the game. Other then that i give it four out of five stars, they loose one because of the disapointing end and the chalenge that it took to see it.			"

												Aside from the crappy PC controls, this game is outstanding. It reminds me of an Indiana Jones adventure in that there's a lot of variety. Problem-solving, melee combat, treasure-hunting, racing, vehicle combat, stealth, and an excellent story - this game has everything. It reminds me of the grandfather in ""The Princess Bride"" talking about all of the perks of the story.It's a shame it didn't do well back in 2003; otherwise, we may have seen a sequel or two. Awesome game, to which I attribute the value of 1,337 brapples.			"

												(10/10) - MasterpieceSo, i just scrolled my recommendations and this poped up... yeeeeah, i just bought this game here on steam to write this review. As you can already see, it gets a full score as the first of my reviews on any steam game. Sure, the graphics are not as good as they were back in the day anymore and as i never played it here on steam, i don´t know how the controls of the keyboard are (i´d use my controller either way).But this game, is one of the two games, that kept me believing in the gaming industry during my semi-childhood. Absolutly amazing characters, a brilliant story, perfect gameplay and a ♥♥♥♥ ton to explore and find, i can assure you, you missed out, if you didn´t play this game.I don´t know what to say anymore to make you play it, i can only hope, that one day, games will reach out to such perfection again. I for my part only know one single game, that surpasses thisone...WARNING:This review ONLY refers to the game itself, NOT the cash grab ♥♥♥♥ of ubisoft. Making this game playable is hard but doable, check the guides for more information!			"

												In how many games can you be a photojournalist who exposes the horrifiic truth behind so called benevolent protectors? The photography that the game centers around is so well implemented that everything you do - including snapping pictures of animals that would normally be tedious - is just so natural. Everything about the protagonist is awesome, and the writing really makes you feel for her. The stealth sections get tedious and the camera and movement is dated, but hell it's worth playing. This game has gotten the following it has for a reason, and the price it's at these days is a steal.			"

												Beyond Good and Evil is a fabulous work of art that originally was released for the PS2, GC, Xbox, and those early 2000's pcs.  The game's story is amazing backed up by emotional moments, compeiling characters, and the need to find out just who is really orchestrating the DomZ attacks and who is kidnapping the citizens of Hillys.  Furthermore is the graphics, I don't tend to focus on graphics much, but, Beyond Good and Evil deserves for its graphics to be praised for a world that draws you into it beauty and to this day has aged quite well.  And the music fits every mood rather it be a tough boss battle or sad cutscene.  Gameplay is also solid--Jade's movements in battle always feel smooth and well executed.  Perhaps the most interesting thing I thought about the gameplay was how it combined not just the action adventure of a Zelda game, but the stealth you would find in such as Metal Gear.  Now there are some issues with this game I should address but shouldn't stop you from playing the game.  One, is that the game has not been optimized for modern day pcs, in fact as soon as you start the game you are given an error that your 'Graphics Card' has not been updated to the latest version, but at least you can still play it.  Then theres problems with sometimes flickering graphics and such, and one of the worst that ruined a very important scene in the game near the end was at the middle of the cutscene the sound absolutely stopped (I had to reload an earlier save, turn on subtitles and go through it again just to hear them).  In other words this game is a straight out port of the pc version that has not been optimized for modern day pcs.  But even though it has issues with modern day pcs I found that it was still enjoyable as it was back when it was released.  I suggest Ubisoft releases a patch so that Beyond Good and Evil can run on modern day pcs better, much better.  If you can deal with the issues then you will certainly have a blast playing this overlooked great game.  However if you don't want to deal with the issues then I suggest you buy the HD version on Xbox 360 or PS3. "

												Beyond Good and Evil is a beautiful game, well worth playing. However this is not the HD remake which came out on consols a few years ago. This is the original PC version. Not optimized for modern PC systems or controllers. Joyt to Key helps, but to get the best experience with this title, try playing the HD remake on Xbox360/PS3 or other original console version. Hopefully if the promised sequel ever does arrive, it will prompt an HD release or remake of this classic game for PC.In short, I highly recommend this title, but not this version.			"

												The Aesthetic of this game is nice, and I see the potential of the story. The primary purpose for writing this review tho is to inform people. Plug a controller in if you want to play this. The controls are rather bad with keyboard and mouse, mostly because they are unbindable and odd. Camera controls are weird with the mouse and I keep pulling up my camera instead of sprinting because some genius decided to bind it to shift instead of sprint. Fun game, just plug in a game pad.

												Great game that I regret waiting so long to play. The story though not revolutionary is solid and pretty straightforward minus the somewhat out of nowhere twist. The characters are all amusing and good fun though double h gets a little annoying at times. Overall the game can be beat in under 14 hours if you're going for completion, 6-8 if you just plow through it.Pros- Simple and easy to understand combat system- Minigames and photography are fun and have a good vary of difficulty without being unfair- A fun break from larger 40+ hour titlesCons- Very rarely controls do tend to not respond correctly- The camera. It works well minus a few sections where it snaps around.- No gamepad support. Used Xpadder. (This con is for those who prefer controller for adventure platformers)			"

I can't get the HUD and subtitles to stop flickering like a lightbulb on the verge of going out... also the sceen keeps fluctiating much the same way at random based on location and the like.Some times I find it annoying at other times.... it... it scares me makes me think that the game is about to crash. And due to the weird glitch that persists no matter what I do when the Resoloution and Refresh rate remain strangely blank as thus I am unable to change it and quite possibly fix the problem.Let me just say to anyone who reads this If you want to buy this game do NOT buy the PC version as odd as that may sound comming from A PC gamer like me. If you happen to have a Wii  or an Xbox 360 or a PS 2, 3, or 4 with backwards compatibility Go with the console version... they... they just haven't figutred out how to get it to work properly for the PC.

												I remember the first time I played this game, back when I was still in school. You could only get it on the console back then. I'd go to my neighbour's house every day after school and we'd have a blast switching the controller between us and figuring out how to get everything done in the game. Getting that last pearl, beating every mini-game, finishing every side quest, exploring all the nooks and crannies....For a couple nerdy kids, the game was awesome, visually stunning with an original story and gameplay mechanics. Over ten years later...and my opinion hasn't changed at all.The graphics may be old, but they're still amazing and the immersive world of Hyllis and its quirky inhabitants soon make you forget about the slightly dated look.The voice acting is superb as well, both in English or French (which I first heard it in). The characters are charming and unique, with defined personalities no matter how minor they are. The story...well, I won't spoil it. But it is a good story, and I honestly can say I haven't encountered anything quite like it since. Game mechanics - your main weapon in this game is not some sort of super staff (even though you do use one) but rather information. Yes, you read that right. You play as a reporter, and your camera and the information you gather with it will be your most important tool and weapon throughout the whole game. Stealth is your ally - you can fight if you want, but the enemies are tough and often in groups, making it a lot harder on your character to just charge through. I will say it is not impossible to win this way though...;)I can only say I heartily recommend this game to any and all who enjoy a good adventure and original games. Buy it and play through Jade's story, I promise you won't regret it.			"

												Beyond Good & Evil is an old, but pretty well done stealth and combat based adventure game.  The combat is said to be similar to the 3D Zelda games, and the stealth aspects are fairly simple cover and line-of-sight based (one ""fog"" segment).  The protagonist, Jade, is a photographer, and the missions usually end up involving sneaking in, snapping  incriminating photos, and getting out without getting killed.  In combat, you'll range from doing OK to being very outmatched.  This emphasizes the need for stealth in difficult areas.  The bosses tend to be more puzzle oriented then strict combat, and are usually fairly easy once you figure out the pattern.Story:  BG&E has an interesting story, but like many games, it feels rushed toward the end.  You're left with a lot of unanswered questions by the end, but not enough that it's unsatisfying or un-fun.Graphics: Fairly old, but still colorful and functional.  There are camera issues, especially in tight corners in some of the stealth segments.  It's usually not enough to detract from the game, but it can cause issues until you're used to it.  Note that, due to the age of the game, there are graphical issues.  They can be fixed by going into the game's pre-load settings and adjusting a few options, follow one of the ""fix"" guides for specific instructions.Controls: Decent, but there are issues.  Keyboard/mouse works, but the game is likely better with a controller.Sound and Music:  Sound effects are appropriate, and not typically annoying.  Music is really good, and very varied in style.Overall:  BG&E is a cult classic, and is a rather good 6-8 hours of gameplay.  The storyline progresses a bit faster than 6-8 hours, but due to the ""gates"", where you need a certain number of Pearls to continue, you will need to do several side quests in order to complete the game.    Some are enjoyable, some are not to everyone's tastes.If you have access to a modern console where the HD edition is available to you, I would recommend that instead of the PC edition.  If you have no other option besides the PC edition, get it on sale.			"

												Pretty engaging story and very charismatic protagonist and pig. The camera would go a little berserk sometimes. Citizens didn't beat me up with a stick when I took random pics of them for no reason.EDIT: I don't quite understand the negative reviews saying that this is a bad port. Maybe because I've never played it before I found it on Steam (I always wanted to play but ended not buying it for the console), but it runs smoothly on my computer. I got the ""IDK WHAT UP TO DATE"" error but it did not stopped me from playing the game without any anomallies.			"

												The Aesthetic of this game is nice, and I see the potential of the story. The primary purpose for writing this review tho is to inform people. Plug a controller in if you want to play this. The controls are rather bad with keyboard and mouse, mostly because they are unbindable and odd. Camera controls are weird with the mouse and I keep pulling up my camera instead of sprinting because some genius decided to bind it to shift instead of sprint. Fun game, just plug in a game pad.

												Beyond Good and Evil is a beautiful game, well worth playing. However this is not the HD remake which came out on consols a few years ago. This is the original PC version. Not optimized for modern PC systems or controllers. Joyt to Key helps, but to get the best experience with this title, try playing the HD remake on Xbox360/PS3 or other original console version. Hopefully if the promised sequel ever does arrive, it will prompt an HD release or remake of this classic game for PC.In short, I highly recommend this title, but not this version.			"

Nice humorous story, great voice acting, beautiful music, good gameplay that includes a bit of everything, platforming, action combat, open world exploration and adventure. The fantasy that is used to make the story, the characters, the enemies and the game world in general is beautiful and creates a unique setting and atmosphere.			"

												I bought this looking for something different and it certainly is a bit different and a lot of fun. It has a nice world and story. The stealth parts of the game are very nice. The side activities to collect money and pearls are fun and you need to do some of them to progress but it does not force you to do all of them which could get tedious. My only complaints are the vehicle controls are awkward and the final boss is an utter prick. You pretty much have to just memorise his attacks.			"

												I wanted this game since it was published, but I didn't have opportunity to buy a copy. Then it wasn't able in stores anymore and I forgot about it. Couple months ago I couldn't believe when I saw it on Steam, so I finally bought it.What can I say about the game? IT IS AWESOME! It was worth waiting so long to play BG&E. The graphics are just beuatiful (although this game is almost 12 years old!), breathtaking soundtrack and very satisfaing gameplay. This game just this ""something"" that most games just doesn't have.The only problem is making it run on Windows 7. Firstly it run too fast, then too slow. Thanks to found on the internet application I managed to play it finally. And the second con is (in my opinion) - lenghts of the game and/or lack of sequel, that should be developed!To conclude - Beyond Good & Evil is game that everyone should play at least once in lifetime, it's really really worth it!

												(10/10) - MasterpieceSo, i just scrolled my recommendations and this poped up... yeeeeah, i just bought this game here on steam to write this review. As you can already see, it gets a full score as the first of my reviews on any steam game. Sure, the graphics are not as good as they were back in the day anymore and as i never played it here on steam, i don´t know how the controls of the keyboard are (i´d use my controller either way).But this game, is one of the two games, that kept me believing in the gaming industry during my semi-childhood. Absolutly amazing characters, a brilliant story, perfect gameplay and a ♥♥♥♥ ton to explore and find, i can assure you, you missed out, if you didn´t play this game.I don´t know what to say anymore to make you play it, i can only hope, that one day, games will reach out to such perfection again. I for my part only know one single game, that surpasses thisone...WARNING:This review ONLY refers to the game itself, NOT the cash grab ♥♥♥♥ of ubisoft. Making this game playable is hard but doable, check the guides for more information!			"

												A photographer and a pig engineer take on an army of aliens to free their planet. Add some airily humor and steady variety for a solid, though unpolished, game. It's a short and easy accessible action-adventure, telling a clichéd story with a cartoony look, while constantly jumping back and forth between several rather shallow mechanics.The problem I have with BGE is a lack of elaboration on most game aspects.The game world, Hillys, looks interesting at first sight. With its water heavy scenery populated by hovercraft boats, it emits a Venetian flair, but offers few places to explore or play around with and quickly reduces to a mean of travelling between more important locations (which unfortunately are all monotonous factories and caves).Similarly the story starts off interesting, with the broke protagonist Jade taking a shady job for a rebel organisation, but wanes to a surprise less ""save your friend from the enemy base"", with none of the, admittedly likeable and relatable, characters growing beyond their starting point.BGE draws from a wide range of mechanics without mastering any of them.The fighting system gives next to no options. The player can only do a series of standard attacks (performed by mashing the button) or dodge, which both don't even work well, due to few rigid movement directions and lack of camera-control. At least boss fights demand to read the opponents moves and occasionally aim a shot.After being the main mechanic for the first part of the game, fighting is mostly replaced by stealth passages, that neither require any planning ahead nor the creativity games like Deus Ex and Metal Gear Solid are known for. The guards in BGE behave on painfully obvious cycles, leaving the player to the weak challenge of switching cover every time they look in the other direction. A less linear level design or some gadgets for distraction would have been a significant improvement.But Jade and her friends don't solely travel by foot. A surprising amount of the game is spent driving the hovercraft, be it in a race, a shoot-out or maneuvering a mine-field. I found the hovercraft parts to be quite enjoyable. It is the one game mechanic providing the most options: shooting lasers or guided missiles, jumping and speed boosting. The races have tight curves and obstacles, making them feel a good amount of fast and the adroitness tests have reasonable difficulties, neither tedious nor making me break a sweat.The last gameplay aspect to keep in mind is Jades iconic camera. The mechanic is straight forward: aim the camera at the subject, adjust zoom and press the button. But the mechanic is less about the execution, but more about the exploration. Rewarding the player for animal pictures, is a clever way to make him care for the game world. The main quests are achieved by taking photographs as well, underlining the theme (although it's made pretty obvious what to photograph in this case).Despite unchallenging gameplay and extraneous story, BGE overall provides solid entertainment. Most of the games parts are shallow or just not memorable, but none of them are repeated often enough to bore the player. The eight to ten hours of gameplay are packed with racing gangsters, fighting aliens, weaving through mine-fields, sneaking behind guards backs, climbing through factory vents, chasing and being chased.Beyond Good & Evil is an entertaining game, but leaves no permanent impression.Read more of my reviews at:theguygaming.com "

It's one of the games I played as a child,and I got into it so much, I completed the game with 100%, which is rare for me.  The story is great, the charactersare well developed and you do care for each one of them, as each one has a role in the plot. You also need your companions to progress and they are really helpful at times, believe me.You should play this game, it has a great open world and a lot of content 11/10 would expose the conspiracy again.Oh and music in this game-- .....
