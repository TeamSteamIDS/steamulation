												God, the memories I have of this game. Delta Force 2 was the first video game I ever played on Multiplayer, and I stood by it throughout my childhood years. I would stay up all night, making my parents extremely angry. It was so much fun. A truly revolutionary game from a Golden Era that has passed.			"

												If only Steam had been around when this game was fresh, I could have tracked the endless hours I poured into it. There aren't many first person shooters out there that could beat what this had to offer at the time. Expansive maps, excellent sniping, and a huge and dedicated community. If dfbarracks, df radio, or dfgirls ring a bell to you, you'll know what I'm talking about.			"

												this game, no matter how ugly it looks, is a mans game. i played this when i was younger on my windows 95 pc, my dad would get mad because i would always be up playing this game endlessly. this is bringing back so many memories. in my honest opinion, this is the first ever ArmA game, one or two well placed shots you are dead, one or two misplaced shots and you are dead. the missions are great and require a bit of thought, trust me this is not a call of duty game, the enemies are lethal and are constantly on the move, if you take out one patrol the other patorls will make there way to that location. the maps are  pretty big and open, even though there is a waypoint-ish system, you are completly free to do the mission from any angle and elavation you would like or can get to. there are not a big selection of weapons and gear, but it gets the job done, my preffered weapon of choice is the trusty M4 with the grenade launcher attachment. another cool thing about this game (correct me if i am wrong) is this is the first delta force game that has bullet drop, not only that, but the bullet is an actual projectile in the game, when you shoot you can see where it goes and the drop it has, so you cant easily shoot a guy from 1000+ meters away, you have to adjust to the drop as well as the movment of the target. so, can i recommend this game? Absolutly if you dont mind the obviously dated graphics. I bought this game for two reasons, 1) its one hellava game and 2) over the years my original cd had quite a bit of use and was rendered unplayable. I can honestly say that i put easily over thousands of hours into this game, since it first came out till this day, and you can bet your♥♥♥♥♥those hours will continue to go up. i should also mention that since this is a game that came out in the 90's the controls are akward, when you start the game dont go pressing wasd thinking you will move as thats not the case, to move you have to use the arrow keys. the audio is not to bad either, i mean its not Battlefield's Ear porn but its still not to bad.

												Pretty much a review encompassing all of the old Delta Force games. This game was the first FPS I ever played. Put simply, there aren't games made today like these anymore. Difficult and brutal these games were, they do not hold your hand like games today. Missions were long, and usually placed you, at the very least, against a whole base of enemies. The worst part being, no saves. You could die at the extraction point of a 30-minute mission and have to re-do the entire mission over. Usually a few shots will kill you, maybe even one if you are unlucky enough. Stealth and movement are important least you find yourself end up getting shot up by 20 hostiles. Getting shot at gave you a terrifying feeling, and fear of have doing everything for naught. Today, games will not give you such a challenge in fear of fustrating the player. The release of Delta Force marked the beginning of realistic shooters (games like OFP and ARMA) and even today is still an enjoyable game.			"

												A very dated game, running on 800x600 with a basic mission system and empty multiplayer. I appreciated it for its in-depth destructible environment, realistic bullet physics, and menu music. What other game has live penguins, killer fish, endless map areas(in 1999?), underwater weapons, AI vehicles and teammates. Rescuing hostages and blowing stuff up, from any angle with any weapon. It's a shame nowdays that nearly all singleplayer mission experiences are about campaigns with one approach and limited weapon types. There are games similar to DF2 now, but none close enough to take its uniqueness. I sometimes go back to it to enjoy that feeling of how it managed to expand the FPS genre.			"

												A real FPS classic, providing decent freedom and elements of reality. To accomplish a mission, players can assault directly, sneak around or cooperate with friendlies. As a special note for the campaign, if mission briefing is read carefully, you will find the plot is somehow interesting - terroritsts can even deceive Delta intelligence, for example. Frustratingly, bugs such as enemies shooting through walls are troublesome. It is still appealing for people interested in old school FPS games after all.			"

												""Best Penguin AI of the 90's. And they're killable too!"" ""A superb classic shooter that puts modern Call of Duty games to shame"". 7/10 (scored for modern times).NOTE: this does work on windows 8, after an automatic install of something.What makes a good FPS? Fear, tatics, and a community of actual men rather than badly brought up 7 year olds. This game does all of these. You can't just brush off millions of rounds to the face like in most FPS's. One shot, and you're gone. FANTASTIC! :DOf course, the grphics are 15 years old now, same as Gran Turismo. But this makes the enemies hard to point out making the game a lot of fun. Obviously the AI are quite stupid but can be well hidden.I eventually remembered how to start the campaign, and I have enjoyed it so far. Yes the AI won't attack from behind if you halt for too long, but, like I've said, are well hidden and won't hesitate to one-shot kill you after a stupid rookie mistake of not checking both sides of a room after entering it. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a realistic FPS, not one with space battles and overrated lens flares. Enjoy.			"

												This was an improvement over the original Delta Force back in the day, however, if you would play this game on any modern system now the game will look worse than the original Delta Force. Other than that the game is awsome minus the ai that gets hung up on walls and has ""eagle-eye"" vision that can shoot you from a kilometre away.Also note that if you have a modern operating system, just be aware that the game crashes a lot and the hardware support for this game is abysmal in every way possible. Only a handful of chipsets will run this game properly in Direct3D mode (providing that you also have the right drivers with it).In software mode the game just looks like puke garbage with half of the polygons on the character's weapon model missing while buildings sometimes disappear in plane f****** site; that also includes enemies.If the above doesn't stop you from playing, then it's a great game and you should play it.

												This game is what ruined most other shooters for me. I remember a certain mission, an ice mission, where an enemy, just visible through the scope of the sniper, was running back and forth between two structures. I fired one shot, I couldn't see where it landed, but I could hear the small sound it made as hit the building. I then took aim. I shot. The enemy was still running back and forth, it took the bullet quite a while before it hit my target. The enemy. I was never in doubt that I was going to hit. I knew. So whenever a game is without ballistics I am unable to hit anything. This is all because of Delta Force 2. Play this game and expect to scoff at games without ballistics.			"

												This was the very first PC FPS I had ever played and I loved it ever since. Unlike most FPS' I was playing (Goldeneye 007 comes to mind), this one forced you to take your time and plan your attacks carefully unless you want your body to look like a product of Pinhead's doing. Granted, you can't command your squad mates like you can in Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising and you can't take control of vehicles, but this is still a fun realistic FPS from the 90's. Now there are some technical issues with the game when I run it on Win8, ranging from small frame-rate issues to the entire game locking up to the point where I have to sign out of the computer in order to close the game, but I still can recommend this game to anyone looking for a FPS that isn't Call Of Duty and wants a bit of realism in their FPS that predates the ARMA series.

												The Delta Force Series games are wonderfully done and well laid out. With each game there are a bunch of missions to complete and things to blow up. The graphics in these games are old school. The shooting in the games can get frustrating at times because you might get headshot from a AI that you can't see. Just take each level slow and steady and for the most part you can kill enemies really far away since there is no bullet drop. The missions can also get frustrating since if you fail something in the mission you might be put right back at the beginning of the level and might rage quit because it was hard to get to a certain point. Just remember quick save and save alot while playing to avoid frustration. The online portion of these games are still alive, but you might have to go looking in some of these Delta Force games. Ive really enjoyed playing these classics from beginning to end and I know you will too if you are a army buff and enjoy a good old fashion First Person Shooter.			"

												Delta Force 2 is the first PC game I ever owned. I was a freshman in high school when I found the disk in the cabinet of my computer classroom. The game ran like crap on my PC but it still blew my mind when I played it. I hadn't played any first-person shooters before this game; since then, because of Delta Force 2's gameplay and style, I've developed a taste for slower-paced, methodical, realistic shooter games such as Arma 2 & 3 and the Red Orchestra series. For me, this game still holds up today and I can easily say it is one of my top 3 all-time favorite games. I have no idea what happened to the disk I found 15 years ago but when I saw this for sale on Steam I bought it immediately. So far I've only played about half an hour, but that's only because it's 11:50pm on a Tuesday night, and I'm a married father/elementary school teacher who has to work tomorrow and I really should've used that half hour to grade papers. In any case, I'm super-stoked for this game and I plan on playing as much as possible as quickly as possible. Why didn't anyone tell me this was available sooner???			"

												While its features are lacking by modern sensibilities, this is still a very solid tactical shooter. The dated graphics aren't nearly as obtrusive during gameplay as a screenshot might suggest and the mission variety is fairly fresh. The only issue I encountered was a CTD whenever I tried to edit graphical settings, other than that its still a good game 15 years since I first played it.			"

												An overall upgrade from the original, Delta Force 2 is an unsung classic. It focuses on realistic feeling missions and open maps that give you lots of choice on how to complete your mission.			"

												Expanded wonderfully on the original Delta Force (which still is enormous fun).  Contrary to the reviews which say the game constantly crashes, I've had no problems at all w my Alienware Alpha i7 / Steam controller.  Still as addictive as it ever was!			"

												Did you know that if you use cheats and put C4 all around certain buildings, they crumble? This was the first shooter I played, and despite graphics that are abysmal by todays standards, I still love it.Missions in various open areas and plenty of weapon loadouts for every play style.			"

												I remember getting this one quickly after playing the first Delta Force game. Man, those were the days!Not gonna lie: Delta Force 2 is exactly what it is. A sequel at best. There's not much improvement in most departments. This game is basically a big stand-alone expansion of the first DF.Of course, you could complain that the devs milked the cow a little with this one, but they were answering a legitimate demand from the market. Can't really blame them, right?Right as you start the game, you will realize that the whole design is pretty similar to Delta Force. The menu is almost the same, but with a different color and different sound effects. On your first mission, you will also acknowledge that the game hasn't changed much visually or gameplay-wise.But it's still a good FPS. Not great, but good. After all, Delta Force, the first one, was most certainly good. Once again, the campaign missions are diversified and exciting on your first time but they also suffer from the terribly predictable AI which crippled the replay value of the first Delta Force since the characters always do the same things and go to the same locations every single time.There are some minor additions. A few new items, voice acting during mission briefings and some minor in-game elements/events, but nothing extraordinary.The main problem is that when Delta Force 2 came out, there were other FPS games on the market which offered more in general, but most especially in the graphics department. The first game of the Unreal franchise quickly comes to mind. Unreal brought unrivaled graphics that came with relatively large areas for the players to explore. DF2 used the Voxel Space Engine which could have been revolutionary if it had been released five years earlier. Unfortunately, when you played Unreal or some other game using a more powerful engine and went back to Delta Force 2, it was a cringy experience even though the available playing area was larger and all that. You enjoyed playing it, but you felt like the Delta Force franchise was definitely at a lower level at that point. When DF2 came out, it didn't feel at all like a AAA title.Those who are senior gamers in their early 30's will definitely be interested in getting this game. It's cheap nostalgia, even if you never owned it back in the day! Younger players who weren't there back when DF2 came out will most probably be repelled by the aged quality of the game. Can't blame them. If they're looking for low-priced game to play for a few hours, however, they should be satisfied if they aren't too difficult concerning old first person shooters which will inevitably look pretty bad when compared to the monsters they make nowadays.
