												This isn't the next coming of Freespace or X, but it doesn't pretend to be either. It's a nifty space shooter with a side of RPG elements, and for what it is, it's actually a great wee game. Given the disappointments in the genre that are available today, going back to titles like this is actually kinda refreshing.			"

												About 90% as good as ""Freelancer,"" this game's flight and combat mechanics are easy to pick up and consistently rewarding. The just slightly campy (and lovably so) story is told well, too.While some games in this genre focus on getting the next ship, ""Darkstar One"" is all about making one ship work for you. It's a slightly different take on the formula, and it's a good one. Also, the game is pretty forgiving, which is nice when similar titles can be ""brickwall difficult"" experiences.I was actually quite surprised with how engaging ""Darkstar One"" turned out to be. Going in, I was prepared to be disappointed. Instead, I was enthralled.			"

												Customizing your ship with weapons and special abilities is the best part about this game. While space battles are well done, fun, and with good physics, it does get boring somewhat quickly. The main missions and side quests can be interesting as it progresses through the storyline, but it does not give you a feeling of great accomplishment as you go through them. The trading aspect of the game can and might as well be ignored completely. It provides you with minimal profits in comparison to the other means to acquire credits. Speaking of credits, I completed the game with 8.5 million credits in my possession. After a while, the amount of credits you accumulate will become obsolete, as you will have more than enough to get whatever you want. The game suffers from extreme repetitiveness, which also creates tedium and dullness when you do the same two or three activities over, and over, and over, and over. Simply put, the game is about 20 hours too long. The developers should have been more concise and implemented more diverse aspects in more ways than just this. The end game is surprisingly bland and unexciting. Also, throughout the game, you are given a false sense of freewill. Your progress is almost completely linear.Darkstar One is good.			"

												Entertaining, although not very versatile. The idea of mixing RPG elements by creating an evolving ship is nice, but merely replaces the opportunity to switch spacecrafts and try out new combinations. Missions might become repetitive (and far less challenging) once you understand the basic components which they are constructed with.If you are looking for an in-depth 4X game along the lines of X: Beyond the Frontier and its sequels, this might be too shallow for you. If you are looking for a more space combat focused game, give it a try. Do not expect the intensity of a Freelancer or Freespace, but at least it might still the hunger until a next Indepence War sequel arrives.			"

												This is one of those games that, while you play it, it is enough to keep you playing and, once you finish it, you forget about it. Not bad, but not amazing.I think those who would appreciate it most are those that haven't played games like Freelancer or X before. The rest will see it as an alright game that doesn't do anything new, but was amusing nonetheless.			"

												Nice space sim. Sadly enough, that's about it. The character animations and voice acting are a bit stiff, the story is kinda boring and predictable.BUT the fighting is fun, the upgrade system is great, the game looks nice and the alien races are distinct. And in a genre that is as starved as this, that's enough sometimes.Well, at least until Star Citizen is released next year.			"

												I wish there was an option for 'Meh' for recommendations. As far as Space Sim shooters go, this is definitely a good catch on the market. The learning curve is hardly a curve at all (if you are able to get on good terms with relativity of direction), and it will keep you going for a while.However, at the time of writting this, 7 hours in, it's becoming more and more apparent just how repetitive this game becomes, and offers you no replay value. The missions are all pretty much the same (""Go there, kill things"") and it turns into an incredible grind fest if you're a completionist like me. Eliminating all the gangs, liberating the systems, flying through asteroids for upgrades and a silly sidequest now and then that is even more repetitive if that's even possible.The game would also like to suggest that there are multiple ways of making money and choosing different paths and sure, there are indeed multiple branches that you can gain reputation in, to become a Merchant or a Smuggler, a Mercenary or a Pirate, a Killer or a Bounty Hunter... Well, except that Merchant and Smuggler are the same thing with a slight risk and much larger reward for Smuggler, Mercenary and Bounty Hunter are just you shooting the bad guys, Pirate is you shooting the good guys and stealing their stuff to sell for Mercenary or Smuggler, and Killer is the same thing except you shoot to kill. So really, not much of difference at all. And even though there are indeed dozens and dozens of systems to explore, there really isn't a reason to. It's all the same anyway, slight differences here and there (image of a planet in the background, number of objects, possible sidemission/collectible (that you can see and check news stand about locations of beforehand)), but other than that, you're probably not going to visit a lot of systems for more than a few seconds while your jump drive recharges.Anyway, to wrap it all up, I would only suggest this game if you want to play a space shooter. If you're looking for a trader game, I would suggest you look at other Kalypso titles, as the trading system isn't really all that great here. If you're looking for something you can pick up and play casually whenever you feel like blowing some space ships up, this is the game for you.			"

												Good fun. Kept me playing for 9 hours (so far). That's not bad for £6 (I actually got it in the sale for less, but I would have been happy even if I'd paid the full price). Fly around space, shoot space pirates (or become one), be a mercenary or a trader transporting resources between systems to make money, do odd jobs for people etc... Think if X2/X3 had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child with an arcade machine...Graphically it's not bad, actually looks quite nice considering it was released 8 years ago. Some of the backdrops are brilliant, an effect only slightly let down by the special effects and textures (which to be fair aren't bad, but nothing special today either).The bad? The voice acting is terrible (so just like most other games in this genre), the story is painful, and the cut scenes look like they belong on a PS1/N64. Also it doesn't capture your mouse, so if you use more than one monitor you will occasionally find yourself clicking on the wrong screen and making the game drop to desktop (disabling the screen in your graphics card control panel fixes it, there may be another fix I haven't bothered looking). Game's crashed twice on me in 9 hours, pretty sure it was to do with the multi screen problem as it hasn't happened since.If you can look past the voice acting (as any fan of this genre has to be able to do), and ignore the low res cutscenes (of which there aren't many anyway), then this is fun.Update: 16 hours... It's more fun than sim, and Turrets are totally OP: my first turret is a lvl 3 railgun turret - every time I get in a fight I hear constant fire from the turret, keep dodging, kill everything!Update 2: 33 hours. I am fury. I am pain. I am Death. I have blasted, burned and obliterated my way through dozens of star systems. Hundreds, maybe thousands of souls floating through the void are my responsibility. A silent testament to my rage. Pirates are afraid to even think of my name. Now my sights are set on Broniss corporation. Flying through a Broniss subturanean complex, and the lead character comes out with the single best comment in a video game of all time ""These Bronies are gonna get it."" So I guess that's that. Bronies beware... One, Two, Funky's coming for you.Three, Four, missiles to your door.Five, Six, wait till you see my tricks.Seven, Eight, plasma burning bright.Nine, Ten, you'll never breath again.Hmmmm... Maybe I should take a break from this game.			"

												A really good addition to the space sim genre, really simple and easy to pick up and play, story is somewhat broken up at times but its more about the journey in the ship and its evolution rather than the over arching story line in my opinion.

												A fun, inexpensive space combat and trading game with some customization options and a servicable story. Can be quite addictive and is easy to get into, unlike some other games in the genre. Becomes a bit repetitive after a while, but you could probably push through and finish the main story a lot quicker than I did. If you're looking for something in the genre and don't want something too insanely deep or hard to get into, it's worth a shot. May not sound like the most resounding endorsement, but this game ended up being quite high on my hours played list and I certainly enjoyed it the entire time I did so.			"

												Ok, so here is my review of Darkstar One. I was kind of hesitant to get this game, but at $2.49, what the hell, right? I had read other reviews, seeing positive's and negative's about the game. I decided to give it a go. So far, I like the game. Good graphics, decent story line, some pretty good space-combat. All in all, not a bad game and is definately worth the price. I like all kinds of genre in games, from Dungeon-crawlers to space sims, to racing and first-person shooters. I grew up on Atari, Nintendo, Panasonic 3DO, Playstation, etc. So, I know gaming. Darkstar One is a good game. It has it's moments, lag, glitches, etc, but so far, I'm having fun playing it. My opinion, if you enjoy space combat, open-""universe"" games, you might really enjoy this one.			"

												Amazing game. Working with Full HD resolution and stunning visulas. Makes you eager to visit and see all star systems, space stations or ships. Main scenarion guides you through different sectors of space and helps you to meet the required level of your ship and equipment before going to too dangerous parts of galaxies. World is open for you to go anywhere you want, and do what you like, even if this is related to short-term mood change only. Beeing mercenary, then pirate, smuggler or psychotic killer, whom everyone attacks on site - choice is yours. You will meet different races throughout your adventure and your ship and crew will be evolving with your knowledge about the sectors you visited.I played before X3, Freespace and similar games, but this one is really coming above them - in terms of open play, graphics and sound, AI of your enemies or volume of side quests and jobs at each trade station. The only con - poor cinematic animations and cutscene dialogues quality.Must have! And it's cheap! "

												This game is fun at first but as you progress it really doesn't add anything and it gets old fast. It has a pretty awful presentation and some of the worst voice acting I've ever seen.At  its core the gameplay mechanics aren't really bad ♥♥♥♥♥ but the space sim genre is about doing whatever you want whenever you want... exploring, trading, fighting, boldly going where no man has gone before. Too bad in this game you're forced to go from cluster to cluster until you pass the arbitrary gate of getting a better jumpdrive and doing the plot (which sucks, by the way). tl;dr it's entertaining for the first few hours until you realize you're doing the exact same thing over and over and they never really add anything new. It's also easy to pick up which is a rarity for the genre (and not necessarily a good thing imo).			"

												Overall a decent game with what I found to be rather fun combat. While the cutscenes are alright they aren't the best out there, some of the dialogue I found a bit clunky. The customisation is quite good and the game does offer many ways of earning money required to purchase these upgrades. There is also a special ability tree that allows you to play to your strengths and I found it to be quite well thought out. Truthfully I have yet to complete the game but from what I played it has been fun, however I cannot comment on replayability. I hope this helps.			"

												So I've decided to take the time to review this as space sims are a fave of mine - maybe they're yours too and you're on the fence about buying this or not.I picked this up  for a fiver and can honestly say it was money well spent. There were a few teething issues (Which I'll discuss below) but overall, so far (about 5 hours in) its a solid, enjoyable space combat/trading/missions game that will not disappoint fans of Elite/Freelancer etc. I had initially intended to run this on a Windows 8.1 laptop system, using my PS3 pad through the built in Xbox drivers - if you want to do this too, don't bother - it just simply doesn't work very well. I only got sporadic response from the pad before I gave in. Secondly, the game will crash if you select certain resolutions - this can be fixed using a custom resolution (just Google Darkstar One custom resolution) but it was a bind having to mess about on both my laptop AND my desktop, Since getting the game working, it's all been good. You start with a fairly basic ship and collect artifacts to upgrade it. You can pick up a variety of missions for cash, or just trade between systems if you like. Other reviewers have criticized the terrible voice acting and this is something I have to agree with - it is terrible for the most part, but the environmental speech from other pilots and space stations still adds to the atmosphere. I'm at the stage now where I've upgraded my ship three times and kitted it out with some reasonably decent gear. Blasting space pirates out of the sky is incredibly satisfying. Pros at a glance: Looks nice. Lots to do. Easy to pick up and easy to follow control system. Interesting ship upgrading system and different upgrades. A steal for the money being asked. Cons at a glance: Some technical niggles. Voice acting is laughable. No tracking of prices between space stations - back to pad and pen! Some missions aren't clear enough about what you are expected to do - example: I picked up an escort mission and met my wingman outside the station - I hyperspaced to the target system and failed the mission because I hadn't got close enough to the wingman for him to jump first... a bit tiresome! If you're still reading this, you're clearly in the right place - get it bought. DG			"

Darkstar One is a 3D space craft action simulator. After learning information on a man responsible for your father's death, you inherit a ship called Darkstar One and set on a chase across the galaxy to uncover a plot against the Galactic Union.Pros: The game offers very intuitive controls that can easily be mastered by even the most novice to the genre, although difficulty might be light for a veteran. The galaxy is a large place with a huge amount of systems you gain access to as the story unfolds. Rather than changing ships, you upgrade the Darkstar One by uncovering mysterious alien artifacts hidden in asteroids or held by criminal gangs, allowing you to tailor your ship to your play style, be it hull strength & turrets, agility & firepower, or cargo & speed, but you still customize your weapons layout and special equipment to your needs.Cons: The story is the worst kind of unimaginative cliché that has its place in a kid's cartoon. The game is extremely repetitive, every system feels identical except for the color scheme, as you always jump in with a single trade station always located at the same distance from the jump gate, while enemy hideouts aren't even hidden by distance or debris fields and are often blatantly identified as ""bandit hideout"". But you're stuck tediously landing in each of them one by one, not by interest or desire to explore, but by necessity to find the very occasional side mission that unlocks some of the systems holding artifacts, as those aren't hidden at all and you'll know exactly where to find each of them. Graphics are awful by today's standard, textures are so low resolution that space backgrounds appear to be an overstretched 80x80 bitmap. The world itself is so bland you have no interest in doing trading or contracts as you quickly make more money then you can spend.Verdict: ★★☆☆☆ - Forget itThis game is a poor attempt at replicating an open-world space game. I spent every minute of my playthrough wishing I was playing Freelancer or any other superior games in the genre. Once the game is over, the boring galaxy offers little to nothing worth visiting again, so you should probably skip this one.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Not a bad game.  Not a great game.  I'd call it good.Fly around, kill space pirates with your own space fighter, do some trading, complete some missions, earn money, and upgrade your ship.  Quite a bit of freedom to choose your own path, and explore different star systems.Sit through the mostly badly acted cut scenes.Then play some more, blast away some more pirates.  It sounds like it should be more tedious, but I think it's actually a pretty fun game.  In spite the poor acting/voice, Darkstar One has some interesting zaniness that keeps you interested, as well as some interesting quests.  And there are several different alien races you can learn about, a number of different organizations, lots of interesting news items in the news feed.  That's probably a lot of what kept me going--reading about the stuff going on--international machinations, and the various groups that hire you out to take care of one task or another.  All while the galaxy inches closer and closer to war.7.5/10.			"

Not a great deal of depth, but the space combat is where this game is fun.

												Oh how I would love for Steam to have a Maybe option as well as Yes and No, because this game is a complete Maybe. I bought DarkStar One when it came out years ago. I was hoping it would be the next Freelancer, and it tried, but it didn't try hard enough.DarkStar One has a lot of good points, but the biggest negative is the repetitiveness. Now if you've never played the game and have read some reviews here, you may think, ""A lot of people talk about repetition, but just how bad could it be?"" Bad. Really, really bad. It would be one thing if there were just a few mission TYPES that you had to do over and over, but you effectively do THE SAME MISSION over and over. I remember one in particular where you have to eavesdrop on a conversation (I think some crime lords are having a meeting or something). You always went to the EXACT same station type, parked in the EXACT same spot to do the eavesdropping, and then the people would have the EXACT same conversation, and at the EXACT same point in said conversation they would notice your presence. Then the EXACT same three ships would launch from the station and attack you. It got to the point where as soon as I was discovered I would fly over in front of the landing bay for the station and pick off the ships as they came out. It was an absolute slaughter. Good for me in terms of reward, but bad in terms of mind-numbing gameplay.The mechanics of the game are fine, and it would be a lot of fun if there were more variation. If you ever played the first Assassin's Creed and got tired of the same thing over and over, this game is worse, and I would advise that you don't get it. If, on the other hand, you don't mind that sort of thing, then I say get this game. So yeah, it's a big Maybe.			"

												Solid space combat sim with some nice upgrade and trading mechanics. Similar to the X- series, although with more of a story and a bit less free-form overall.In the years since its release, it's definitely been eclipsed by newer fare, especially Elite: Dangerous, but it's still a fun game.The ship upgrade system, in particular, bears mention, as it's unique to this game. Collecting artifacts allows you to upgrade your ship, the titular Darkstar One, in one of three key areas - Engines, Hull, and Wings. Each has its own effect on speed, weapons, and durability, and cosmetic effects on your ship as well. While it doesn't have a big effect on gameplay, the fact that your end-of-game ship doesn't necessarily look the same as someone else's end-of-game ship is a nice touch.			"

												Honestly, I would only recommend this game during a sale.  I spotted it for 2 dollars and went ahead and purchased it and I am really glad I waited.  If you are a huge space sim/shooter fan and have not given this game a try then wait for it to go on sale.  The game has some nice things about it, don't get me wrong, great controls, nice and clean ui, and a huge space to explore...but if you are hoping this game is gonna bring you a deeper experience you will be disappointed.  It is shallow in that regard.  Missions take about 2 minutes to complete, which I hope gets better as I move forward into the later parts of the game.  Trading doesn't really have any depth and I do not believe there is any mining options.  If you are in the market for a great space shooter then just stick with Freespace and Freespace 2.  If you want a mix of shooter and more freedom then go with Independence War 2.  Even Wing Commander Privateer is a great choice over this game.  I will continue to play this to the end but I can definitely say this game will not be memorable.  Play it, get whatever you can from it, and get Elite Dangerous when it releases.			"

												Until the  more recent X3 series was released this was one of my favorite  space shooters.  It's exactly six years old  yesterday, but stil looks amazing graphically.  It's only £2.99,  half the price that Good Old Games are charging. The  first person cockpit-view is your only portal onto a colourful stellar landscape of nebulae, planets, stars, space hulks and asteroid belts. There are similarities to the original Elite  (gameplay wise only) where players  can  choose to pursue a career as a ttrader, bounty hunter, smuggler, mercenary or even just as a  plain old  mass murderer. It's well orth the  money.  The graphics are not as sharp as the X3 series, but are  still beautifully rendered.

												Freelancer's better. Having said that, this basically is Freelancer, with an upgradeable ship and horrible (I mean just atrocious) voice-acting. Seriously, I hate to let something like that ruin a game for me, but it really does. The main character sounds like Bear Grillis on Red Bull. It's really bad. It's like first season of Babylon 5 bad. Worse even.The game itself is good, but I can only play it for a couple hours at a time or the terrible (srsly; just hideous) voice-acting starts to make me want to kill someone.[UPDATE]I really feel bad that I let that one thing ruin what would otherwise be a very enjoyable game, but it really is THAT BAD. I almost don't want to say it again, but I just tried to play this game again, and couldn't keep at it for more than twenty minutes. The voice acting really is that awful. I wish somebody would make a mod that replaces all the voices with professionals. Or even just people who don't think they're William Shatner or Clark Gable.[UPDATE 2]Okay. I FINALLY was able to get past the voice-acting. So I've played about 4 hours into the game, and... meh. I almost wish I hadn't. I was happier believing this was a pretty okay game that was just ruined by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice-acting. Alas, that's not the case. Imagine Freelancer, but you're locked in the cockpit view. And the economy is pointless. And the plot isn't great. And the combat is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ easy.DarkStar One is a great idea done poorly. It would kill as a mod for Freelancer (there's got to be something newer that I should be using as a reference, but X is far more complex than FL), but on it's own it's just kinda flat. You bounce around the galaxy, collecting pieces to put on your ship and shooting things. Not much here to get excited about.I can't believe I'm still writing about this game years later, but it's only recently that I feel I've given it a fair shake. So I give DS1 a ""don't bother."" It's not horrible, but it's really not worth taking the time to download. I like a good space sim, but the locked-in-the-cockpit view in what's essentially a Freelancer clone is just sillydicks.

												Im going to rewrite this, because I have finished the campagin and Im quite disappointed with this game, it is not nearly as awesome as I remember.I owned it on CD years ago, when I was big into space sims/traders (Freespace 2, Freelancer, X3) I was excited to see it on steam.If you like freelancer, you will like this though not nearly as much.AWESOME THINGS:-The game looks good-The alien races (yes many are copied from other famous science fiction) are pretty cool-The universe and backstory are cool-Your ship (Darkstar One) looks cool-You upgrade your ship like freelancer better shields ect BUT you also upgrade your engines, wings and hull like an RPG game.Not So awesome things:-Universe is repetitive, every system no matter what race owns it, has the same setup-Despite the number of aliens the variety of ships is limited (light fighter, heavy fighter, freighter, small cruiser, big cruiser, science station, trade station, asteroid)-Where you can land and what you can do is limited, this game does not have the exploring that freelancer had-Diologue sucks, yes obviously poorly translated but very poory written.-You cannot upgrade everything on your ship to max.-Low replayability value (you could go for a different build but meh)-NOTHING TO DO POST GAME - there was lots to explore and do in freelancer, hell you didnt get access to the good ships and weapons. By the post game here your fighter is probaby as good as it is going to get unless you didnt do the side missions or collect upgrades.-No multiplayer-Annoying ♥♥♥♥♥ copilot always talkingREALLY awesome things-Joystick can be used-Simple, fun combat-You feel OP-You can destroy just about everything in the game (with the exeception of some spatial anomolies and already destroyed wrecks)In conclusion: Im glad I bought and played this game again brought back some memories of past gaming, and while repitive and limiting I still enjoyed it but I have a feeling that I will not be playing it again.

												Although there are a lot of negatives, generally if I finish a game, it's good enough for me to give it a thumbs-up. It's slow, very repetitive, and very linear for an ""open world space sim"". On the other hand, the ship controls feel very nice, and the game always has something for you to do. If you don't want to pursue the main quest at the moment, you could just go kill some baddies for fun and profit. Of course, you won't be able to ""level up"", unless you follow the main quest, which is a bit of a bummer.Leveling up also is a bit awkward, since you don't really get anything for it, other than the ability to buy some upgrades from the local trade station. Those upgrades can cost a LOT of money, though. The game levels up the enemies along with you, so you'll never feel much more powerful than when you started the game, aside from there being more flashy bits when you hit the fire button. There's a mission toward the end that is next to impossible if you've been conscientiously upgrading your ship, though, so you might want to skip some of the upgrades until you've finished it (Flak 2).I'd say the modeler did pretty good work on this game, even though it shows its age. There's a fair variety of ships that you'll see flying around. Would have been nice to be able to pilot some of them. :) The textures are pretty bad, and sound was just ok, but voice acting was a bit cheesy.If you like space sims, give it a shot. If you're not a fan, pass this one by.Space sim fans: 8/10Others: 5/10			"

												Darkstar One is a space flight simulator in the trade/fight/explore genre that most people are familiar with from games like Elite and Freelancer. Darkstar One is not a game that deviates much from the tried and true, most of the features and design direction you find in Darkstar you will also find in the older successes of the genre.You play the game as Kayron Jarvis, a young pilot who's father was recently killed through nefarious means and you set out to discover the truth. Of course you will quickly trip over a number of large conspiracies and eventually have to save the galaxy from an evil race of aliens. That is all standard.To aid you in this quest you have the unique and powerful spaceship ""Darkstar One"" at your disposal. Unlike other games in the genre you will be stuck inside this one ship for the entirety of the game. That is not to say you will be stuck with the same capabilities for the entire game. As you progress through the game you will find artifacts for your Darkstar that will allow you to upgrade your ship with additional weapons and turrets.Visually, Darkstar One looks pretty enough not to disappoint. The special effects are not overdone, and the visible part of the ship's cockpit feels gritty and natural. The design of the ships and other larger space vessels is striking at first, but it does become somewhat repetitive after a while.The sound effects, while not top-notch were good enough to sort of blend into the gameplay seamlessly. The voice acting, on the other hand, is mysteriously void of the ""acting"" part. Blame it on the fact that the game was translated from German.The biggest problem that Darkstar has by far is the fact that it simply feels like a pale copy of other, far more successful games in the genre. There is nothing in it to grab you while playing. The combat is overly simplistic after you master the controls and the story is about as engaging as the evening news. You almost get the feeling that Darkstar One was put together by people who either didn't know how to make an interesting game, or simply lacked the will to do it. Darkstar One is in need of fire and passion; it lacks the imagination and creativity needed to captivate the player. The gameplay feels flat and it becomes very tedious after a while. Even though the initial impressions may suggest differently, Darkstar One doesn't deliver the type of experience that space sim fans are looking for.It's not a game I'd normally recommend to anyone but it just happens to be in a genre that is woefully short on quality these days so if you're fan of the genre you will probably end up playing this at some point regardless of it's faults.

												This is a great game if you're like me - looking for a fairly simple sci-fi space sim.  It's very easy to jump right in as the tutorials do a good job of teaching the mechanics of the game.  It has a little bit of depth in terms of customizing your ship and whatnot but it is not overly complex.This is not the game for people who are experienced players of the genre.  Anyone who has played many of this type of game will likely find this overly simplistic.  However, for the more casual player, it's a great deal of fun and is likely a good starting point for anyone wanting to get into the genre.  In terms of gameplay, it reminds me a bit of Freelancer (Digital Anvil/Microsoft - 2000).The graphics and sound effects are quite good for 2006 (I don't know how the 2010 Xbox 360 version compares).  The flight mechanics, including fighting, exploration, docking, etc. are very smooth and easy to get used to.  I have read some reviews stating that it is repetitive and boring but again, that's probably from gamers who are looking for more complexity and depth that can be found in other games of the genre.To sum up: DarkStar One is a great, entry-level space sim that is designed for simplicity and accessibility.  It is a lot of fun and very easy to pick up, even for someone unfamiliar with the genre.  It is not designed for seasoned veterans of the space sim genre and does not offer the depth of a game like Elite: Dangerous.  For anyone who wants a good stepping stone to get into the genre, this game is $10 well spent.			"

												Like most other space sim games, it takes a while for it to unravel itself and all its goodness. So don't trust any negative review with under 10 hours, and even that way, they haven't completed it, which I think is totally needed in this game to give it an honest rating.This game is cruely overlooked but is well worth its time for any space sim fan. Lots of things to do (main story, side quests, random missions, escort missions, trading, smuggling, bounty hunting, ...)A main story giving a lot of different and surprising situations that keep the game fresh and enthralling.A good twist compared to other games like this : you don't buy new ships, you evolve yours in a combinations of 3 different aspects, as you wish (and it changes the visual of course). You have to find artifacts for that, which pushes to exploration and add dynamics.The graphics are really nice (even more considering it's from 2006), the different designs enjoyable.The only flaws I'd see : some shortcuts missing, a bit more of a tutorial would be great, and more details about total energy balance too (sometimes getting the best weapons you can without thinking will just drag too much energy and empty your capacitors so fast that you won't be able to shoot often, so it's important).In the end, nothing gamebreaking at all.A really fun game not to miss for a lighter, but still demanding, experience in the genre.

												Old School Space Shooter, similar to Freelancer, Privateer and the others of this time, maybe somewhat simpler than others. If you liked them, you'll know this already, if not - try it out. Graphics, complexity and replayability are far behind e.g. Star Conflict, but it's still a decent time waster for a few hours of explosive fun. It's main drawback is what ultimately destroyed the genre - space combat get's repetitive over time. Also, the grand finale is somewhat of a letdown.			"

												Dogfighting, Trading, with a little RPG action with your ship upgrades this game is well worth the price tag. Played great with a mouse and keyboard setup. In a nutshell you travel from system to system fighting battles and upgrading as you dive deeper into the galaxy. Also has a fun little story line with cutscenes as the game develops to keep things fresh. Think Elite Dangerous but a few years older with way less PC demand and almost no learning curve. Easy to pick up put down and pick up again with ease. If you would be interested in a video review please let me know and I can add it to the review list.			"

												For a older game its dam good for a space game and there are a few mods out there for it but not too many of them. In its time i think this game was over looked because of bigger names like Wing Commander and star wars and so on, To tell you the truth for a space game i would put it up there with them, Maybe a little past them for this reason, It does have a story line in it and yes you have to follow it to get anywhere in the game but there is so many things in the game you can do, you can be a miner, a trader, most wanted man in knowing space, bounty hunter and so on, for a time you are all of them. I would give this game a 9 out of 10.only reason why it lost one what because of the graphics, the game is old but the graphics are still up there for its age.			"

												Wow, this game has really held up over time. Great game so far. The only bug that I can consistently see is that the mouse is not constrained to the game window. This means that if you're a multi-monitor user, you can see your mouse travel off of the game scren and onto your other monitor. If you click outside the game it seems to lock it up and requires a hard restart of the game.This isn't as big of a deal as it seems as long as you're fairly good at space combat games in general. Only noobs would be so far off target that they would click outside the screen during a firefight, but it does kinda suck for downtime when you're chilling on a station and want to do something on your other screen. I don't see any options to fix this in-game, but it's not really a big enough problem to merit me trying too hard.For $1.50 it's practically criminal not to purchase this game.Matter of fact, I'm just gonna check the box below this review form that says ""Check this box if you got this product for free"".

												I liked this game for the first 10 hours or so, which is ok, right?  It's not like this is a AAA release and it's going to be dirt cheap, right?Well, for cheap you'll endure an super annoying and unasked for co-pilot, whom, much like her counterpart in X4: Rebirth, serves no real purpose and we're asked to believe that we would wouldn't just flush her out of the airlock at the earliest opportunity.You've got one ship to fly that is upgradeable . . . but only if you can find the ancient artifacts it needs to grow.  Finding these artifacts becomes a central theme as you cannot upgrade to better weapons without first upgrading the Hull, Wings, and Engines.  You're even told at the very beginning that one should concentrate on the wings so that our intrepid pilot has more than one weapon firing forward.  IF one chooses to focus only on the wings, then when it comes to fire the weapons you drain your energy reserves so quickly that one will constantly be unable to fire your weapons at all.  You are, therefore, forced to upgrade each area with each level-up, which renders what should be a non-linear game into a hopelessly tedious affair with some really horrible writing.If you must buy a space game, go with X3: Reunion or invest in Star Citizen.

Nothing is terrible (except maybe the laughable cinematics) but nothing stands out either. It feels very much like a dumbed down Freelancer with a less engaging story, universe, and ship designs.

												Darkstar One is like a mashup of sandbox space trading games and more quest / storyline driven games like ""I-War 1"" or ""Freespace"". It's a good job it does combine the two ideas together. Otherwise this game would not be quite so good.The trading part of it is almost a complete rip of the original ""X-Tension"" - except MUCH lighter - you only have one ship to pilot (though that ship does evolve as the game progresses), there's hardly any weapons / equipment to spend your credits on, very few, and very repetitive, sandbox mode missions. In fact if this was the only aspect to the game, Darkstar One would be one of the most pathetic turkeys in history. Luckily this ""X-Tension"" part to the game plays only a support role to the main ""quest"" part of the game, enough to keep your ship equipped up to the challenge of the next sector's worth of quest missions. Which IS worth playing through. Again though, the spectre of ""repetition"" will haunt you throughout the entire game. Presentation wise the scenery is very nice for the time of it's release - but eye candy alone won't make a game a classic. This is not a classic. It's good, but not THAT good.Your character Kayron Jarviss may as well be Guybrush Threepwood's wimpier brother. The taunts he uses against enemies are just laughable..... ""I'm behind you (duckie)"", ""Oooh, nearly got you (schnookielumps)"" etc..... seriously amusing!My copy running under Windows 8.1 constantly crashes randomly. Which brings up a really detailed error reporting system to report the problem to Ascaron. This error reporting system then ALSO CRASHES every time. Jesus. H. Christ!Still, thanks to the continuous autosaves done at every available opportunity, you'll never find yourself loosing more than five minutes worth of effort!It's 1000% worth the £1.19 that's it's currently on offer for the next few days, along two other titles! (After May 18th 2016 - you'll pay £6 for it by itself - not quite as good a deal)			"

												Big discount on Strategy First games?  Okay.  Let's see what they have...  Hmm, interesting, here's a neat little game.I won't compare Darkstar One directly to any of the Big Four.  In case you have no idea what I am talking about, then let me give you a hint:  The Big Four games in this genre start with the letters F, P and X.  (Two share the letter 'F' for their name.)  These games are held by many of space sim/combat games to be the pinnacle of the genre.But I'm not going to invoke the Big Four in direct comparison to Darkstar One.  Comparing DSO to any of those has been done before in other reviews, and at times, I feel this comparison is unjustified, particularly when people say DSO isn't ""as good"" as the Big Four.I suspect the developers of DSO have played the Big Four.  There's lots of elements from those games present in DSO -- And, in fact, I would argue that you couldn't MAKE a space sim/combat game without having those elements, either borrowed intentionally or re-created without realizing it.  It's like hold-left-dragging to select units in an RTS game.  That is an extremely common and intuitive manner to select lots of units.  It's become a common verb in RTS games, and in hind sight seems like a very obvious thing to implement and if you were to create an RTS today, you would implement mass-unit selection in that very manner.  To do otherwise would be unnatural and new players would complain.  Someone else found the most optimal verb for expressing an intent, and it's become a part of the building bible for the RTS genre.Therefore, DSO uses a lot of the same verbs as the Big Four.  If you've played the Big Four, then practically nothing in DSO will seem out of place.  It's all there, it works like you expect it to, and that is what makes this game a lot of fun, even for someone such as myself.  I've played practically every major and note-worthy space sim/combat game out there, and that's not really much of a boast considering that I can only think of a dozen in my entire lifetime as a gamer.  This isn't a genre that gets a lot of attention.DSO does it right and does it competently.If you are a die-hard Big Four fan, you can't go wrong with DSO.  Just give it a chance.  The graphics are good, the voice-overs are decent, the plot and characters are okay, and the game mechanics are just fine.  There's all the elements you would expect from this genre:  Exploring, trading, bounty-hunting, alliance/allegiance shifting, pirates, Big Scary Aliens Doing Bad Stuff To Everyone, Mysteries to Uncover, etc.  The whole kit and kaboodle.The only real issue with DSO is that it doesn't bring much new to the table aside from the single, upgradable ship instead of the more typical ladder-climbing of purchasing better ships.  I also like how they implemented the cargo carrying system, as it allows your super agile combat ship to suddenly take on the characteristics of a slow, vulnerable cargo vessel without forcing you to switch ships or land at a station first.  That was well thought out.The game is well made and both looks pretty good and plays well enough for what it is.  And damn, you can't beat the price.  (Under $3 as of this review.  I would have gladly paid far more for this game, if I had known about it before hand.)If you aren't a fan of the Big Four, and in fact if you are confused about what I am talking about:  Give DSO a try.  It's a good starting point for someone interested in this genre.  If you want more, then don't worry.  The Big Four are still around and you can pick them up at bargin prices.  (For the uninitiated, most of the Big Four are really old games.  Like, one of them is a DOS game!  See what I mean about this genre not getting much love and attention?)DSO is worth it, no matter if you are a fanatic of the genre or not.  It's not going to blow you away, but it will provide many hours of solid, fun gaming and that's more than can be said for %90 of what is on Steam. :)Kudos to the developer of DSO for making such an enjoyable game in this genre!

												This game is pretty fun. 3D space combat was disorientating for the first little bit. The game is pretty buggy though. Multiple crash to desktop, crash on exiting, crash on launching etc. I had to reload quicksaves 7 or 8 times as scripts wouldn't run after completing an objective. I've gotten to the part in the main story where""Continue the search for Jack"" at an ambush, but can go no farther. Reloadig saves cannot get me past this point. I've given up. There is no Steamsave, and this being a pretty old game I don't have hope of it getting patched or playing another 17ish hours to get to where I was.

												Darkstar One is basically a downgraded, linear version of the original Freelancer game. While, in it's own respect, it's a pretty decent game, don't expect any innovations. In Darkstar One, you play as a young, emerging escort pilot named Kayron, who's father has been recently deceased (probably been a few months to a year, doesn't say exactly). Eventually, Kayron learns the true nature of his father's demise and learns that a man named Jack Forrester was involved. Most of the game's story is gallavanting across the galaxy looking for this dude. In order to earn money to buy better stuff, you can perform contracts as a mercenary, become a bounty hunter and claim the rewards on pirates, become a pirate yourself and raid cargo ships for their goods, ship trade goods across sectors, or smuggle illegal contraband in a similar manner. Overall, it's an alright game. If you want a decent space sim style game to put some time into, pick this up on sale. If you're looking for a Star Citizen or X-series experience, look elsewhere.

												Following the likes of Wing Commander and the X-wing series, DarkStar One is certainly not an original concept, but it is still an incredible space opera--a well delivered story, great voice acting, an open galaxy, intuitive user interface, multiple side missions and other fun stuff will keep you entertained for many hours. Trade, smuggle goods, steal cargo, kill pirates, or just go postal and kill anyone you meet.The limited side missions get repeatedly boring after a while, especially given the vast number of solar systems, but there are keyboard shortcuts for everything allowing you to skip most mundane tasks. The space combat is really enjoyable and gets progressively more difficult as the story progresses. Add ship upgrades and you ultimately become one bad hombre.I got roughly 40 hours of enjoyment--your mileage may vary. This is not a space simulation--it is highly action based.

												Darkstar one has given me that nostalgic space fighter kick Iv been craving for the last few weeks and the price was also not too bad - I would recommend this to anyone that doesnt mind liner based star fighter games - graphics still relevant after all these years - though I presume there are better space fighter games out there - the classics that brought us there are always good to play.

												DarkStar One is a space shooter with a fair amount of RPG elements that make it great for burning a few hours at a time. The space combat is exciting, and though there's not much variation from battle to battle, they're generally quick enough to prevent it from being tedious. There's also a bit of an economy you can learn, as well as a sort of reputation/morality web that gives you certain perks based on your playstyle. It'd be nice if the game wasn't so dependent upon its story, but then again, it lets you know up front that its RPG elements are strictly secondary. Really hope they make a sequel that goes a little more in depth.			"

												Right off the bat. The graphis are nice. The music good. Controls are good. I used a mouse and keyboard and didn't miss the joystick for this one. Story is interesting.. or was, what I got up to.  At one point, shortly after I reached Earth, I suffered what I now know as the infamous ""White Hyperspace Bug"".  It is where your hyperspace load screen goes white and freezes.. Rather, you hear the engine, music.. everything appears to be working.. except it's white and frozen.  After some research in the forums and google, this is due to a corrupt save. Simple fix right? Go back a few save points. *WRONG*. Most people had to reinstall the game and lost their efforts/progress.  This is an issue that the developers never fixed and will never fix from what I'm seeing. I requested a refund to my steam wallet for the $1.99 (a pittance I know, but it's the principle.. a *broken* game should not be sold.), but since I didn't encounter the bug until 7 hours into my gaming, I was denied: Twice. Thank you for nothing, @Steam, ABSOLUTELY *SH!TY* customer service and a rip off. My only solace is that I grabbed this on sale and am only out the $2.  Some people were lucky and never had this problem. If you're feeling lucky, well.. good luck. Save often. Pray.  It would have been an enjoyable game otherwise.			"

												Following the likes of Wing Commander and the X-wing series, DarkStar One is certainly not an original concept, but it is still an incredible space opera--a well delivered story, great voice acting, an open galaxy, intuitive user interface, multiple side missions and other fun stuff will keep you entertained for many hours. Trade, smuggle goods, steal cargo, kill pirates, or just go postal and kill anyone you meet.The limited side missions get repeatedly boring after a while, especially given the vast number of solar systems, but there are keyboard shortcuts for everything allowing you to skip most mundane tasks. The space combat is really enjoyable and gets progressively more difficult as the story progresses. Add ship upgrades and you ultimately become one bad hombre.I got roughly 40 hours of enjoyment--your mileage may vary. This is not a space simulation--it is highly action based. Space shooter fans will not be disappointed.			"

												It's enjoyable for a few brief moments to blow away vessels in a manner that harkens back to the classic Wing Commander. The thing is, without a robust economic engine, an interesting and dynamic universe to explore, or even a decent storyline to follow, DarkStar One just becomes a boring game. The voice acting is just horrible.			"

												This is a really fun space flight sim/dogfighting game...you can pretty much do what you want: Be a mercenary and accept fighting contracts, do trading and make money or follow the story. The controls are really easy even without a joystick, and the ship you fly (the 'Darkstar One') is badass because it's made from 'alien technology'.Sure, the voice acting and the character animations aren't the best...but it's a space flying/combat sim, so you really don't see many of them outside the sparce cutscenes anyway.Definately worth the price!

												The game could have been a real contender in the space sim genre, but the severe gamekilling bugs and general errors the game suffers from completely obliterates any chances this game had, even back in 2006 when the game launched DSo suffered from a morass of issues the worst being the save game corruption which leads to the infamous infinite loading white hyperspace bug which is near impossible to fix leading to potentially hours of lost time and work - most people who have finished this game will tell you, save the game often because save games will get corrupted on a regular basis.If your easily frustrated by bugs, having to repeat missions due to bugs/crashes and hate near constant corrupted files then never bother with this game.

												The core of the game is extremely monotonous.  Go here, shoot bad guys, rinse wash repeat.  I lost desire to play the game after 5 hours, but kept telling myself 'it will get better.' and 'I must finish what I started.'  I ended up beating the game, the main story line probably could have been beaten in a quarter of the amount of time, I spent a ton of time flying to asteroids to collect upgrade items (artifacts) and pointlessly killing worthless pirates thinking that the money was important.Overall, functionally, the game is great, only crashed 3 or 4 times, ran well, no technical issues.  But the game itself feels basically over after a very short amount of time.			"

												Speaking frankly, this was the first space sim-like game I played in my life back into 2007, when my previous experience was limited to only watching of Descent Freespace as a kid and one failure of getting along with X series. And that was hilarious for the first try! Years apart, after clashing Galaxy on Fire, I suddenly remembered about that title, and here I conquered it again, now on Steam. Still, the years away the game was released did not hinder my player experience, and this is why:Pros- Plot. It's easygoing - you've got a girl, some friends, and some business to do, which eventually brings you to saving the galaxy;- Easy UI. Everything you have hidden in the settings layout is present on the main screen and can be accessed via ""Space+Mouse"", which makes the game as easy as your tablet app. Way to go, X;- Good graphics. I am not saying the CG is excellent or anything, but giving that I am running it on a retina screen and the eight years this title is away from released hot, I cannot afford myself speaking something against: this is why it goes for pros;- Freespaced. I trust this is not a spoiler, and having accomplished your road-trip to hell and back, you are free to gladly rest at any beloved system and to watch clouds running on some blue planet sphere;- Descent difficulty. That's as highlighted, not too easy, not to harsh, except for some AA turret missions, where you have to play a very lucky sitting duck;- Funny names of space systems. There is an entire sector devoted to Russian names. No balalaika cruisers though;- A cutie! Cubisctic though.However the feedback would not be true if I don't mention what I didn't like:Cons- One -your- ship. I know it is the best, but still;- Fairly limited assortment of side missions;- Unskippable animations. I mean those you meet while striking a mission, teleporting, or simply embarking a station. I do know how they are beautiful, but trust me, once will suffice;- No mining fun. As it is said: you need to... fire asteroids to mine them. I wonder if I ever be old enough to be busy with it. And even so, the outcome costs nothing;- Limited musicbox. That's a space game, not a CofD!- Some achievements and/or cards would be welcome;- The cutie left me alone in the end.Anyway, if you are new to the space flying genre, you are saving the Galaxy on Fire for over-Atlantic flights, and still willing to grow to something much difficult and multisided as X, this is where you have to start from. And don't delay it until MS Spaceflight Simulator!			"

												This games is extremely similar to Galaxy on Fire 2, so if you played that one you definitely shouldn't bother with this one (and vice versa).As for the game itself, it has most of the problems that make me not recommend GoF 2. The combat is quite simplistic, with little dynamism and skill involved. Enemies don't manouver in natural way, just go straight towards you in a very predictable patterns. Side missions have little variety and a very linear progression mechanics, scaling to your abilities (sounds fine in theory, but in reality it nearly nulifies any real risk-taking and uncertainty when you take them).I would be able to reccomend it a few years ago, when there were no good space sims on the market, but nowadays it's just not worth the time, even if it's cheap.

Yet another ""space"" game that assumes space is a large bowl of clear mud, and that Newton was completely wrong. Freelancer got the right combination of proper space physics and simple controls. So far, I've not found another game whose developers actually understand anything about physics AND simplicity. Just for that, Darkstar One is going to have to be an awesome game to get a ""recommended"" from me.Problem 1: [resolved, kind of]. Glad I got it for $2. Graphics are non-existent on my system. Cutscenes are the quality I'd expect, then I get an early 1980's mainframe VT100 ""interface"" during flight. Whether this is a bug, or by design, I don't know. And frankly, I don't care. If they sell a game with advertised gameplay graphics. that's what I expect.        RESOLUTION: reduce to lower screen resolution. Seems it can't handle the higher resolution, even if it claims it can.Problem 2: [resolved] Tutorial says to select cargo container, but couldn't find it. Turns out text was a grey on darker grey background in an unexpected and unlabelled section of the target selection text list.  Grabbing and releasing container wasn't an issue, FINDING the damn thing was the issue. Future cargo containers should be easier to find. Things are always easier once you know how. Not very impressed with the organization of the target selection list.Problem 3: [kludge found, not really resolved] crashes during combat. Often. Regularly. It's made the game almost unplayable at this point. Further analysis shows that it might be due to a combination dual-monitor setup and Darkstar not having a true ""fullscreen"" mode, but only a ""borderless windowed"" mode that they *call* ""full screen"". So the mouse goes off the edge of the screen when fighting, I click to fire, and it clicks on the desktop. Darkstar then crashes. Haven't found a way to force Darkstar to have true ""full screen"" mode where the mouse is restricted to the single screen. And yes, Darkstar crashes 90% of the time when I use Alt-Tab, and 100% of the time when I click on the desktop even when not in combat.        KLUDGE: use ""WinKey""+P to cycle through display options. If your ""main"" monitor is (2), select ""projector only"". If your main monitor is (1), select ""computer only"". Then start the game. Pain in the a r s e, almost as bad as Steams Puritan-s h i t h e a d censoring system. Still looking for fix that tells Darkstar One to create a REAL ""full screen"", mouse-capturing option while leaving the other monitor alone.Problem 4: [unresolved] Then there's what's almost become a trope in video games, the ""let's screw the player over with a totally new interface that acts nothing like what they've been practicing with all this time, and make it a boss fight that you have to complete in order to continue the game"". To be precise, the ""flak"" fight.  It's effectively a poorly done space-invaders mini-game, but written either by someone who really doesn't care about games, or someone who simply hates the people who buy their games. Either way, it has no place in Darkstar One. Just for that pile of steaming excrement, this game will never get anything other than ""no recommended"".  Opponents are pretty much invisible against the background until they get really close, the ""radar"" doesn't actually give accurate locations, nor does it give any idea of how far the opponents are. Unplayable, at least for me. I'm tired of wasting my time on this game. Opinion: stay far, far away from this game, even if you get it for $2 it's not really worth it.			"

												Like many others out there, the game freezes on the third training mission and there's no way past it.  No amount of uninstalling and reinstalling DirectX, drivers, or the game helps.  I would love to try this game, but I can't get past the first 20min of play.			"

												A little bit of a cross between Elite! (Ian Bell, David Braben) and Wing Commander . The game could use a little balancing most fights are just simple interspersed with 1 or 2... NO WAY IS THIS POSSIBLE missions. The Mod availible isnt a mod so much as a trainer and its pretty quickly just cheat mode.I did enjoy the game for several hours but found myself wanting to cheat past a mission pretty quickly and once I have run into that broken balance in either direction I lose interest in the game. Pick this up on sale its fun enough to be worth a couple dollars. graphics, voice acting, story - 6/10 not bad in any glaring way just really not good gameplay - 4/10 the dog fight and space flight really brought me back to the original elite good, just unplayable points without cheating terrible5/10 might be worth 2$ "

												The premise seems interesting, a starship that evolves as you use it but right off the bat you can tell this isn't going to be a game you can just jump into. I played a little over an hour of it just to make sure but it didn't really see to hold any special sway. If you have a joystick and you want to play a spacegame, this might be interesting but it's very difficult to pilot with a mouse.			"

												A wonderful and surprising game where you must fly inside artificial asteroids and collect artifacts to upgrade your ship(you can manually edit the game xml files and mod the game not to artificially increase the number of artifacts needed in a Fibonnaci scale for each new upgrade)Otherwise ...the game gets impossible near the end and I needed mods or cheats to finish it twiceYou meet wonderful new species...and the universe is pretty small			"

												The story is really weak, the Combat isn't great (see Elite: Dangerous for an example of great starship combat), but the overall expirience here is a lot of fun as you search asteroids for relics to upgrade your ship and explore a fairly open galaxy and make a 'name' for yourself. I still can't figure out how to make the missiles work though.			"

												DS One is a good looking, fun playing open world, space sim/space shooter rpg. It has a massive map, you could play for 10 hours and not be halfway through it, you might have to do a slight bit of grinding to upgrade your ship once you're fully into it, but thats ok, because fighting space pirates is always enjoyable. It's CG cutscenes are what really make the game look old, you'll immediately realize this game was from 2006. The voice acting can be awkward and stilted, yet if you give it a chance it's kinda charming for what it is.It's a simple game loop, go into hyperspace, get quest, go into hyperspace, kill pirates, get money, go into trade station and upgrade your ship, and repeat. There's also artifacts, they're used to upgrade your ship and are scattered around the map everywhere, they're tedious to get because they're always 1-2 minutes away from where you entered, and then you have to navigate some dumb asteroid that only has 3 variations to it, and get back out. That's probably the worst about the game. Besides that, if you have a new/powerful computer, you should think about Elite Dangerous instead. If not, well this will run on a potato. Which is convenient for some.			"

												This game has a typical single plotline, with your average cut-scene/screen text narrative. However, this plotline is a product of a professional story writer, so this linearity does not bother you. Besides, the game has so much to offer! Karma system (although it's harder to be a bad guy, well, the devs are german, so I can see why);Trading system, sophisticated just enough to not to get boring;A very beatiful graphical design - hold Q and make some wallpapers!Diverse in-game moneymaking - fight pirates, be a pirate, trade, smuggle, accomplish a variety of missions...Interesting upgrade system - brings some RPG element into the game. And the game really benefits from it!Weak sides of DSO in my opinion, are:Small room for maneuver during combat - makes all non-cruiser fights pretty straightforward;Useless minimap;Very small HP indicator when playing 1080p;Bad controller support.

												I picked this one up during the last Steam Sale for about $3 and it's a huge bargain at that price.  It's nothing special, but engaging and fun enough to keep coming back for a few hours every weekend.There is a whole main story about how your father died, and the story behind your ship (DarkStar One), but mostly you spend 99% of your time going from system to system killing pirates, hauling cargo, spying, smuggling or whatever you feel like and making enough credits to upgrade your ship.  You can also treasure hunt, trade, and just randomly explore.A fun time waster if you like RPG's and Wing Commander type games.  If you see it on sale pick it up.			"

												Fans of Freelancer and Privateer from back in the day will appreciate this update to the ""open space"" mission centric universe and dogfighting type ship combat.Restrictive in an arcade/rpg fashion in some ways, but still a good use of game time if you are not fanatical about open ended choices on all fronts.
