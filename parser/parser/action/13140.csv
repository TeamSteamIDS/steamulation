												I had my most epic game moment ever playing this game. The map was snow canyon and after several rounds I was finally able to cycle into the sniper position. 18v18 game. I find a nice place to go prone in the foiliage by a log and survey the battle to the best of my ability. I'm way too far away and its hard to get a clear shot, I'm feeling more and more useless as time goes on because I cannot see anybody. Before long, I check the team status and discover I am the only guy left alive on my side whereas almost the entire enemy team is alive.Right about then, I'm getting general chat messages thrown at me like grenades:""KILL YOURSELF""""STUPID SNIPER""""THIS WILL TAKE FOREVER""""HE IS ON TOP OF THE CANYON, KILL HIM""I do my best to ignore them, my heart starts pumping. Then I see an enemy.Just like they tought me in the in-game sniper training, I found a target across the canyon running parallel to me. I fired and he went down.""NICE SHOT!""""HAHAHA""""♥♥♥♥! HE GOT ME!""Then I see another. Bang, dead. My heart is pounding with excitment. I reel around to the bottom of the canyon where it looks like someone is shooting at me. I have the superior advantage. Bang, dead.Bang, dead.Bang, dead.The chat is going absolutely crazy.I don't know how I did it, but I managed to take out the entire team single handedly in one of the more realistic sniper sims.Log onto another server and promptly get owned, and conistently get owned from that point on. I don't care, this epic moment keeps me warm.Awesome game even though its a propogandic as all hell 15/10			"

												This was an amazing game. It got me hooked in the realistic war sim genre and I met some of the nicest gamers in this game. The community was amazing, the game was tense, and my adrenaline would flow when I was being shot at while giving medical treatment to my buddy. Most notable was that this game gave you all the content right away for free. The game serves as a wonderful promotional tool for the Army in a fun format. Also the game featured the most realistic training in any game ever. Most servers required you to complete this training as well. It gave me a look into how the Army works. Over all this game is by far 10/10 would shoot my drill seargent again, but then...PUNKBUSTER SCREWED US ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLTHIS GAME IS NOW UNPLAYABLE BECAUSE PUNKBUSTER DOESN'T WORK RIGHT AND MOST SERVERS HAVE UNFORTUNATELY SHUT DOWN OR BEEN ABANDONED BECAUSE NO ONE CAN PLAYRIP AA3			"

												Although this game has been abandoned, it was still one of the best FPS games out there. Not only was it free, but it offered a completely different kind of tactical gameplay not found other shooters. The entire games foundation was based on teamwork and communication and required you to think before you pulled your trigger. It is still playable but you'll find that the amount of servers to play on small... and the amount of players even fewer.			"

												By no means is this ""the best FPS ever"", but you will be hard pressed to find a more realistic shooter. The physics are realistic, weapons are not one-shot death-lasers, and if you want any medical attention you will need to emphasize teamwork. But probably the best thing about the game is the oddly mature community! I can't remember ever being trolled or cussed out...Call of Duty kids must not know this game exists.			"

												Yes.A thousand times yes.If anything, this game healed me of my CoD cancer.And I played it a long time ago.Please, if you can, take this game, revive it, it's a great game which focuses on Teamwork above all.It focuses on communications, brains, not brawn, and most of all, tactics.Who enters first, who breaches, who is taking point.Who is covering, it can all be arranged, and agreed upon, and it's amazing.It doesn't matter wether you're good at shooting, or bad at shooting, you could engage as support, surpressing your enemies.Guns? Who the ♥♥♥♥ needs more guns when tactics like this get to be used?[Although, I would prefer if a bigger gun variety was added]This game is, in my opinion, 10/10.Will pick it up again. TODAY!			"

												    I've played this game for maybe 30-35 total hours. I'm a Vietnam vet, a 2-tour NCO, a wounded -combat- vet, BTDTGTTS, dear reader. I wasn't one of the REMF's. I'm also a man that's spent a lot of hours playing other shooter-type games on the PC, occasionally on consoles. I prefer the PC. I don't enjoy the easiest, or the hardest, setting, prefer the medium-tough degree in single-player. I seriously wanted to enjoy this game, but....    I do not enjoy online play. I've tried it a lot, in numerous other shooter games. While AI can at times be -odd-, in their style, you can at least learn mostly what to expect. I can't say that about online play, I just do not like playing with, or against, other human players. I'd probably have a lot of fun with this game, IF it had a single-player mode. Sure, maybe it's because I'm -old-, I am, but it's a GAME, folks. It's supposed to be fun. I don't want a crowd of children, whose reflexes are twice as fast as mine and have time to do virtually nothing but play games, repeatedly kickin' my ♥♥♥. Sorry, it's simply not my idea of a good time.    If they ever release this game with a single-player mode, with a good story and thoughtfully crafted missions, I'd likely be one of the first to buy it, but as long as I have to compete against children, it's not fun. Hey, if it ain't fun, why do it?			"

The game has a high level of realism, which also works in its favor.  However, the game is rarely updated and continues to have quite a few glitches.  The game has many unavailable features that are to be implimented in ""future updates.""  I was one of the first to download this game in 2009; don't expect to see the updates any time soon.  As is, the game gets a 7/10 for me, and would be scored higher if the developers were more diligent about updates.			"

												America's Army 3:Positives:+ Free download, doesn't cost a cent!+ Great community, many of whom are mature aged gamers using microphone to communicate. A real team based First Person Shooter which rewards players for helping each other. For example, the faster you medic teammates, the less damage they will take to a limb when they've been shot in that area. + Realistic firing mechanics. When an enemy is shooting at you, aiming becomes much more difficult and guns are not always 100% accurate. + Most maps are small, which would traditionally be viewed negatively. However, this complements America's Army 3 because it allows players to become experienced with the environments, memorise key spots and provide accurate communication to teammates without confusion.+ Decent graphics, could be better though.+ A First Person Shooter which actually concentrates on skill, quick reflexes, constantly assessing your decisions and leaning around corners instead of blindly charging in like Call of Duty. The game is tactical but fun, deploying smoke grenades and flashbangs at the right time is useful, but they're balanced and not overpowered.+ Steep learning curve. This is a game for true First Person Shooter players. It isn't for the impatient or those who want to ""respawn"". Once you die for the round, you're out. So the game is about survival and teamwork, not personal glory and ""leet solo skills"". That said, it would be a mistake to compare this title to ARMA or Operation Flashpoint games. There will still be times when you are the last man standing and need to hunt down the enemy against the odds - good fun.Negatives:- With the release of America's Army: Proving Grounds, the sequel to America's Army 3, this game lost a large proportion of its community. In fact, the entire Australian group has left, and there remains only a few servers of dedicated American veterans with a love for the game. So, if you're from the United States and interested in this game, give it a go.- Limited weapon selection. The developers did this to reflect real-life military loadouts, but you aren't even given a pistol or knife as a secondary weapon. There are two main guns in the game, the M249 SAW and the M16/M4A1, with optional optic sights. Not a great amount of variety there. Overall Score: 8.5/10America's Army 3 is an underrated gem. Having played it over the course of a few years in excess of 1,000 hours, I can honestly say this game has huge replayability. Definitely download it.			"

												Alright, let's talk about America's Army 3. If you haven't already guessed, it's the third installment. Coming from America's Army 2, it's a slight let down. That said, the game does have far better mechanics then it's predecessor (AA2), and even it's successor (Proving Grounds). It has all the mandatory and fundamental features/mechanics you expect from a tactical shooter. The game has a very authentic feel when playing it tactically. However, all that falls apart because of the poor server performance, terrible netcode, and inconsistent hit detection; sometimes you'll slay everyone left and right, and other times your weapon appears to be firing blanks.Because of that, the game ends up benefitting from a more aggressive, run & gun style of play. So you'll see players firing in fully automatic, spraying down targets, strafing back and forth, spamming grenades, and so on. If you're the kind of guy (like me), that takes things slower, covering every angle and watching every corner, you should come out on top. But when it comes to shot placement, it's very inconsistent. You'll be the one to take accurate, semi-automatic fire at an enemy, and he'll spray back at you, and more often than not, he'll win the firefight, strictly based on the poor hit detection. Even though you line up those shots perfectly center mass, they'll feel like they do nothing at all, and even if you do win that engagement, chances are you were wounded in the process.In short, this is an incredible game hampered down by those issues. If it was well polished, bug free, and had excellent online server performance, this game would be amazing. I want to love this game. I really do. It is an addicting game, with interesting gamemodes, and realistic weapon handling and maneuvering.The reason why I'm recommending this game, is because it's FREE. It costs you nothing, and it's a decent experience. But you'll no doubt see the potential the game has, and wish it was better in all those areas I covered. Even with all its faults, I prefer it considerably over that of Proving Grounds, which in my opinion is an abhorrent game and a disgrace to the America's Army series.If you want to see what AA2 was all about, look up ""25Assist."" It's a community made effort to bring America's Army 2.5 back to life, and has been running since around 2010. If the same love and care that was applied to 25Assist was applied here for AA3, it would no doubt be one of the best tactical shooters out there.In the end, it's fun, and you may enjoy it, but you'll just keep thinking about how much better it could be.

The graphics aren't the best but what it lacks in graphics quality it makes up for in gameplay, its usually best to try and work as a team and try and work out a strategic route with your fellow teammates. Overall America's Army 3 is a really great game! the graphics aren't the cleanest but the gameplay is very fun and very tatical for any gamers that want a change from Call Of Duty or may not have the money for ArmA 3 I'd give this game 7.5/10 Definitely worth the download!

												America's Army 3 is a decent game that bring pretty realistic gameplay. This game takes alot of patients, skill, precision shooting, and great team-work. A few precise shots can turn any game the other way, team work is a must in all game-play. The training camp in the game gets you ready for anything you might encounter out in the field. Many diffrent classes for everyone. There is allso 68 achievements to get all so. Game play is quite fast at time, and slow depending on the person(s) playing. This is amust try for anyone into the military, or just really heavy team-work game-play.			"

												The game is fun, and the US Army developed and sponsors the games, so that's something. The UI in the game is the biggest turn off for me, its generally terrible. If you can get past that however the game play can be tactical, and is almost always fun. Its for you to decide how much you will like the game, but I am here to say AA3 is worth your time to try.

 America's Army 3If you're looking for CoD or Battlefield, stay away from this title. If you want standard FPS play, stay away from this title. If you want to charge into battle Rambo style, play this game--but not on my team. If you are curious about military service or interested in a serious attempt at simulating combat where wounds are not typically superficial and team-oriented play is a must, this may be the game for you. It's aging a bit now, and the game's community/development has been replaced by that CoD wannabe pretending to be an America's Army game. BUT this is still a great game. If you try it and like it, you might even see if you can get a copy of America's Army 2: Special Forces, as in some respects I think that was a superior version. The AI on it, some of the training, and especially the special forces training section can help anyone improve their FPS game--regardless of what game you regularly play. That being said, it does have limitations in areas that some other pay to play games do better. However, fewer jumpy Halo types to annoy--either because they're too chicken to play games like this or because they have enough sense to adapt their style to this game. That right there makes it worth playing in my opinion.All in All  America's Army 3	 is a good FPS Game!7/10 From Me Sweep "

												Used to play the original when it first came out for years.  People who like this game are people who appreciate realism and challenge.  This game does have a learning curve.  Every piece of equipment has a specific way of handling and if you don't know it, sometimes you won't figure it out.  They used to make you take a ""class"" in each activity and pass a test before you could actually qualify for it in game.  Like being a medic, sniper, paratrooper, using the modern Humvee equipment, etc.  Tried this version a few years back and kept dying nonstop, might pick it up again at some point.  This game was great and a great value.			"

												If you see it as a propaganda instrument, then the mission has essentially failed. You go to the army to undergo a boring training and die a quick and painful death. When you see this as just a game that happens to be produced by the US Army it does not really work as well. While clearly the focus is realism, the game is hardly playable. The maps have far too large walking distances. Graphics looked great, but FPS dropped a lot on mid-range hardware of that time. Objectives were not really clear so it boils down to deathmatch. Actually people amassed on the servers playing the smallest and simplistic map available (some kind of bridge) and it became a slow paced sniper challenge with a very long time to respawn. There are far better alternatives in the realistic military shooter genre with optimized game-play available although this one is free or well, already paid from your taxes if you live in the US.

												This game pretty much takes place after meps. Those who do not know what meps is its consider the ""Military entrance processing station"". The way it works is once you talk to your recruiter you will take a test called the asvab. Once you have passed the asvab you will than go to meps.. After meps you wil than get shipped off to basic training (where the game takes place) The game is literally a blast and its pretty accruate on the test that happens during basic. Found it really cool that you have to pay attention to your teacher in order to get the correct answers on your test. This is what i called a realistic simulation of basic.

In short it's awesome and it's only drawback is that there's not a lot of people playing it these days on steam servers. Obviously there are games that are graphically more advanced, but pretty graphics are not why this game was made, or why people play AA3.When I first started playing this game, I was almost shocked how easily I got killed or seriously wounded.

												Ok, What has happened to Americas Army ! It has de-evolved into  warmed over vomit. The graphics is horrid. The mechanics is horrid. The game play is horrid. And i am comparing it to the first version.   Why has this happened? Welcome to the new army i guess..     Where pervs with too much corn starch in their system, are in the army laying in the tent. While the straights sit out side getting frostbite unable to go to jag. Where it is well known women get the best jobs and advancements due to laziness. Do not lift anything. Can not keep up. Make more money selling their V. And getting more V than the men.    Such a lame game deserving of a lame but true  review. LOL  Ok, now on a serious level. This game is not worth your time. :)			"

												Let me start off by saying as a young child I was a huge fan of AA2, and I had a ton of fun playing it. That's why it breaks my heart how much this game sucks. The controls are extremely clunky and cumbersome. There's very, very few guns available to you (there's not even a real sniper, they just slapped an ACOG on an M16 and called it a 'DMR Sniper'.) and the training just feels pointless. It's very obvious that it was rushed, too. A good 70% of the game isn't even available yet, and just says it's a work in progress. 4/10			"

												One of the worst games out there. I see why it's free. Support the troops, but this game is BAD. Did the training, and then the Dev states afterwards you cannot use the training or it slows down their servers. Second, just TRYING to access a multiplayer game is unacceptable.. litterally. I have fiddled my thumbs with this game and crapbuster for 3 hours and no go. You join the server and you either go to desktop or main menu depending what you tweak with, with PB and AA3. Bad, bad experience if I must say so. War Inc is better, plus, you get the same outfits as AA3. :)			"

												AA3 was a major disappointment after playing version 2.x for years.  Everything that made 2 so great was thrown out for 3.  The tactical gameplay that was so great in 2 seemed to have been abandoned for something more along the lines of COD, which, while good in its own way, is not a tactical shooter.Retaining the dev team from versions 1 and 2 would have been worth the money.

												I played the game from AA1.0 version till AA2.4 version and LOVED the game! Even before the SF-version! The only maps then were Pipeline, Bridge and Weapon Cache(something like that). Those maps were AWESOME! You really had the feeling of being part of something. To bad i had to leave the game for a period of time. I saw this game and got excited all over again! I've told my friend at work how awesome this game was and accually a few of them also played. I really got the feeling back and tried to search for the game. Then i saw on Steam the 3.0-version. I downloaded the game and pressed play. I have to say: IT SUCKS! Now with AA3 you no longer have to quallify for any type of gun or class with some training. In the previous versions you had to do Basic Training and IF you were good enough you could advance to the sniper rifle class. Medics were only a few ppl because you had to take an exame in order to be a medic. Now everyone can be just about anything and if you download the game you just pick a server and play.It really takes the FUN out of the game and every noobie who want to play accually can. Sorry AA-Developement Team but you really F*cked Up the game! This is not even close to what it was. I dont mean the graphics and all because thats the charme of AA but i mean the whole Lay-out, Load-out, almost every aspect from the previous versions. I hope your 4.0 version will be closer to the previous game style so ppl can play the game like a few years back. Greetz General			"

												Hey Guys,  This is SpeC first off I would like to say that I am not that into FPS games, so when I was introduced to, America's Army: 3, by a friend it did not really scream COOL in my face but I finaly took a liking to it in these ways. It  made itself cool in a unique way because it takes a realistic aprouch and puts you in the shoes of a U.S Army soilder and takes you through trainning. I like it because it teaches people very important skills like First Aid, Gun Safety, and other skills that can be used i a life or death situation. Now I was in Boy Scouts so some of the skills I learned I learned again in this game, but that does not mean I didn't enjoy it. So in conclusion i HIGHLY recomend people who are looking for a ARMY simulator and urge them to play this one and NOT A point and shoot, no scoping, killing for fun COD game.			"

												Taking cues from the currently popular trend to cater to the realism-enthused, America's Army is one of a new breed of team-based tactical first-person shooters. Costing approximately 6.3 million dollars to make and powered by next-generation Unreal technology, the title delivers a tried and true Counter-Strike style of multiplayer. America's Army is one of the five most popular PC action games played online. It provides players with the most authentic military experience available, from exploring the development of Soldiers in individual and collective training to their deployment in simulated missions in the War on Terror.But the actual experience is very monotonous......However, very realistic for the US Army,I like this~But the game is very common, I do not highly recommend you to experience.

												America’s Army 3 is possibly the most realistic fps game of all time. It is almost a perfect simulation of how an American military skirmish actually works. If you want realistic war first person combat this game is for you. If you however are more in to Modern Warfare, stay away from this game. You don’t get to call in air strike. This is simply the more realistic version of counter strike source. Don’t be fooled by this game’s graphics, it’s a total computer resource hog. Lags like a ♥♥♥♥♥ on my low end pc, runs fine on main. So if you have a subpar pc don’t expect it to run very well. There is virtually no content in this game, there is a class system and a leveling system, everything else is below average.

												Great game, good fun but I prefer 2.8...AA3 is a somewhat setup from the version before but they have removed all the stuff that made it great back the ... I have a feeling they are starting to go down hill from here. Graphics: They are an improvement and still not as good as a modern game but a bigger improvement over their previous games. Audio: The audio is basics of army sounds, yelling ""Frag Out"" and so on, the guns are a lot louder than a normal sound, the same as the foot beat sound when running, it's like thunder on the ground. Controls: The controls are super easy to get used too and it's made simple for people. Game: The game is basically an army recruitment system (with no respawns here either) and you battle on a few maps (not many at all) and take an objective or eliminate the other team completely, so it's not much but a simulator with skill to kill the other team, otherwise really good fun for a while but I found the game to be stepping away from what made Americas Army 2.8 and below great.

												Please do not waste your time and hard drive space to download this game. There is a saying that my old Pee Paa used to say, ""Anything free is good, unless it sucks ♥♥♥♥"". This game would fall into that second option. Let's go over why this game is bad,-You have to go through boot camp (Not a tutorial, tutorials don't take more than one hour)-You have to take a darn TEST in a darn CLASSROOM to pass through to the actual game (Not kidding)-You will get thrown in A VIRTUAL JAIL for shooting your drill sergeant-It seems like a propaganda tool to get you to join the U.S Army (Probably is)-Clunky and lackluster gameplayIf you are looking for a realistic shooter please try the following-Project Reality mod for BF2 -Red Orchestra 2-Arma SeriesBUT! If you have the hard drive space and the download speed, download this mess of a game. It will make you laugh harder than a gosh darn comedian about how ridiculous it is. I mean really? Virtual jail?

												America's Army 3 is a free FPS game that was published by the US Army for recruiting purposes.  It worked for Win 10, sounded ok, looked ok, played ok.  Has optional solo recruit training mode and multiplayer PVP FPS mode.  It is an older game and graphics are dated.  This is a Team-based realistic shooter.  Great game to try if you thinking of going to enlist in the Army.  This is not a game for COD or Halo players.  There might be bugs still.There is a Newer version of this game at this site so there won't be any more support for this AA 3. https://www.americasarmy.com/Try it, if you like realistic shooter games.For more info:

												America's Army 3 is a free FPS game that was published by the US Army for recruiting purposes.  It worked for Win 10, sounded ok, looked ok, played ok.  Has optional solo recruit training mode and multiplayer PVP FPS mode.  It is an older game and graphics are dated.  This is a Team-based realistic shooter.  Great game to try if you thinking of going to enlist in the Army.  This is not a game for COD or Halo players.  There might be bugs still.There is a Newer version of this game at this site so there won't be any more support for this AA 3. https://www.americasarmy.com/Try it, if you like realistic shooter games.For more info:

												Overall, America’s Army 3 continues the exceptional game play that preceded it and provides countless hours of entertainment.America’s Army 3 is the third installment of America’s Army, a first-person, online, multi-player video game. It is the official video game of the U.S. Army, which also developed and published it. AA3 was created with the intent of giving the player a realistic perspective of the common soldier, with the game play taking a serious approach to teamwork. Players are rewarded throughout the game by working together in teams, securing objectives, confirming enemy kills and healing wounded soldiers. Rewards include advancement through the Honor system, medals, badges and coins.			"

												This is a brilliant game (well, for anyone who lives in the U.S., or maybe even Europe), however, it is quite dead. Only 2 or 3 servers are populated at any given time (from what I experienced), and an extremely steep learning curve (not that it's a bad thing, I like it).If you were to play this game in 2010 or so, it would be great. Acceptable graphics for 2009, quite realistic, so good it could give ArmA a run for it's money. Well, it can't, but only because ArmA has got mods, and a large number of active community members helping to make the game better every day.However, for a free game, it is (or WAS) good.Not recommended, however, as the game is dead as an AIDsbolapox-ridden, decaying carcass.

												I would not recommend playing this game. It is a free to play game so the only thing you'll lose in time. It may be alright on its own merit, but I'm coming from the perspective of someone who played a lot of America's Army 2. If you're coming back to the franchise in hope that it will still be the a team based tatical shooter, you'll be disappointed. If you're just coming into the franchise now, you might like it. I think other shooters do it better even at this price point.I will update this review to be more in-depth at a later time.			"

												Great game with unique mechanics that set it apart from the rest of the genre. Sadly though due to the poor buggy release, there isn't much of a community and development stopped leaving it feel half done. There was massive potential here, but it will never be as good as AA2 once was and it looks like they have no interest in returning to the more sim aspect judging by the shockling bad new game. I'd still reccomend this game however, if only for the unique medic mechanics, the amazing sounds and the schooling system (which was genius) if it still exists.			"

												Not many positives things to say about this game.  The purpose of this game is to be a recruiting tool for the US military.  It looks like they took a 90s shooter, strapped on some clunky graphics, gave it a confusing heads up display, and never bothered to work out any bugs with the launcher they have.  I was excited to play at first.  It seemed like a game that could potentially describe a military experience.What I experienced was a ""Boot Camp"" where I had to read what was being done to my character.  Then when I tried to actually do the missions, it wouldn't let me.  I restarted, and I was able to join the boot camp mission before I crashed.  So I decided to skip boot camp and go onto the missions.  I would spawn, and die a few seconds later.  Sometimes I would die and it wouldn't say why.  I was part of a team completing an objective.  But to what this objective was?  No idea.  And when I asked for help, some dude with a name such as ""Die♥♥♥♥♥xFreedomx"" would tell me to go back to boot camp.  ""Sorry, I tried boot camp, but it either wouldn't let me do it, or would crash out of it.""But what else can I expect from a recruitment tool?  I can assure you that this game would in no way attract me to the US military, unless I thought ""Die♥♥♥♥♥xFreedomx"" was a good screename to have.			"

												Difficult to get into as a casual player, but it does have potential as a squad game if you can manage a small party. Expect those playing to have a great familiarity with the maps and their best points of attack. The game is a bit dated and the knowledge you can gain from this game is limited compared to older versions.			"

												America's Army 3 is a free multiplayer first-person shooter. It is a team based FPS, like a cross between Battlefield 2 and Counter-Strike. You play either as the US Army or as the Opposing Force who are generic baddies. The teams battle for various objectives on a variety of maps with an array of real and fictional weapons - the fictional weapons are used only by the Opposing Force. The heart of the game are the team-based multiplayer battles. There is no free-for-all deathmatch; everything you do is geared toward the idea of working as a squad of US Army soldiers. There are plenty of problems, such as glitchy animations and weapons bugs. Also the graphics could look better, therefore that it uses the Unreal Engine 3.America's Army 3 can be really good if you have a good connection to the server and if you can find other motivated and cooperative players. But it can take hours until you are able to find that combination.Sounds 7/10Graphics 6/10Gameplay 8/10Atmosphere 6/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												This is a perfect example of why marketing games have such a terrible rap. Clunky, boring, awkward, and ugly. nothing about this game is smooth or intuitive. The UI is horrid, the graphics in-game are barely a step up from games released 8-10 years ago. (BF2 modern combat looked almost as good but was 100 times more fun to play.)The AI is absolutely laughable, unable to hit the broadside of a barn from 5 yards away. Of course your Ai buddies are great shots, go go super USA...Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against the USA or their armed forces, but this game is a wreck. I cannot belive it still is updated and played honestly, but then again, there are thousands of Roblox players still I guess... No accounting for people playing God-awful games.The worst part is I think it had potential! Some of the elements are cool, the medic system, while clunky and awkward, is a cool concept. I like the different ways you can interact with your soldiers and such. The whole idea of you being just another soldier in the field is fun, but the execution of this title is incredibly poor.Fix the graphics, redo all the UI elements, make the gameplay much smoother and more intuitive, etc etc... I tried this game years ago and it was unplayable.

												Actually one of the worst shooters i have ever played.If the U.S really thinks that they can require new troups by giving dumb shooters for free they must be the dumbest nation of the world. How can such a brainwash be legal ? I mean play this game for about 20 minutes, u can really feal how the game tries to manipulate you, try another free to play shooter on steam such as Team Fortress 2 or AVA.This game is not worth the time you spend downloading on it!And by the way thx NSA please protect me and my Family ;)			"

												AA3 stands apart from mainstream shooters like Call of Duty for one reason: it's very much a team-oriented game.  If you're a fan of COD (I happen to like COD, Battlefield, and CS), you'll find that the gameplay style here is significantly different.  Yes, there are some players that like to run and gun, but for the most part, this is a game that requires you to move slower and have more patience.  Having a mic for this game is a must, if you want to get the most out of it.In AA3, there are no respawns.  You have an objective, which, depending on the game mode, could involve securing points, grabbing a suitcase and bringing it to a point, or escorting a VIP to an extraction point.AA3 also feels very different than Proving Grounds.  Much more teamwork in this game, far fewer players running around solo and dying in 15 seconds.Pros:- It's free.- It's team-oriented.  Regular players use VOIP to call out enemy locations, so a team with mics will annilihate a team without them.- There is a pretty cool medic system.  Getting shot affects your movement differently if it's in your arm vs in your leg.  You can treat injured teammates, but have to apply the correct treatment.  (Sadly, there are only 4 possible treatments, so ultimately you just have to memorize those 4).- If you're not good at twitch shooters and like something more tactical, this is for you.Cons:- There are bugs.  You must learn to live with them.- There is lag at times, but it's tolerable.  Don't like it?  Try another server.- There are essentially only 3 weapons (M4, M16, M249), but you can vary them a bit with different scopes/ammos/loadouts.  They also function differently if you pick them up off a dead enemy.- The community is small.  I'd guess there are only a few hundred active players.  Servers tend to fill up between 9pm and 1am EST.Give it a try... it takes a little time to learn and get good at.  It's free, so why not?			"

I wouldn't recomend it if you're looking for something different. If you're interested in something differnt, look for Private servers on the first America's Army game.			"

												Really good tactical shooter; was worried because of spyware so I stopped playing. But I liked the realism of not being immortal and that you had to think before you acted. Just rushing forward hot-headedly usually got you killed and meant a long wait before you could play in the next round. Recommended as the game itself: yes. Spyware and potential NSA-infection: no.

												The game is horribly optimized, I can barely run it smoothly on lowest settings while I can run other games with high settings.The gameplay is ok, but gets me bored after the same thing over and over again scenario. The biggest problem is still the optimization though, if they fix it it's gonna be really cool.Besides that, this game is pretty cool, unlike CoD, this actually requires some teamworks and your brain to accomplish something.It's pretty cool, you should try it.

												Having played a meagre three hours in this game, I can by no means say I am a veteran player. However, I can say the game has crashed numerous times without reason, Punkbuster is broken, and I literally had to google a fix for it and manually install an outdated version of the program. Training was easy, controls however are non standard for an FPS game. (alt to sprint? what? toggle aim?!) All in all it really isn't worth the time downloading or playing. Great training missions and bullet physics and all, and I'm sure if I played enough I'd get used to it, but for the average Joe K. Gamer to jump in and have fun, nah. Also, saw buttloads of invisible guns.			"

												One of the best F2P titles I have ever played - and one of the extremely few that are actually completely free.You have to keep in mind this game was designed to get young people to sign up with the US Army, so if you have amoral problem with supporting that, rather stay clear of it.I hadn´t, and I´ve had a lot of fun for a lot of time.I´d characterize this game as ARMA 3, but mixed with CoD MW2 in a mixture of 3:1.One of the most important aspects is its semi-realistic gunplay and overall feel. It´s one of those rare games where you can actually feel the weight of your character, the recoil of the gun, the inertia of the bullet and other physics-related impression.This creates a lot of immersion, but will make it rather challenging for new players, that haven´t played a (semi-)sim (or ""Simcade"") recently. However, you will get a very detailed tutorial, which you can play whenever you like (I hate it when a game forces you to play a tutorial, and then you can´t revisit it for the remainder of the game). Very well executed.This, together with the above average learning of the control scheme, reminded me a lot of ARMA. The graphics and sounds are both very well made for the time, and they still hold up to todays standards.Now to the CoD-like aspect. The maps are predominantly medium-sized, maybe think of Array from Black Ops 1. This means you still get to fight at a distance, which is essential for the realistic feel, while you still encounter lots of enemies to be constantly challenged.Just as in CoD and BF, you unlock most of the more interesting guns through gameplay, which might be too grindy for casual players, but will keep anyone with a good amount of time on their hands occupied for quite some time.I like the different game-modes. While they are nothing too innovative, you still have very distinct gameplay differences between the different modes, instead of just ""shooting as usual, but stopping to cap a flag occasionally"". Every mode actually feels different enough to stay interesting over longer periods of time.This game can be played either competitively (everything you play, from the tutorial to the hardcore challenges is timed and objectively scored, so you can literally compete in anything you like with your friends) or rather casually (games are quick to jump in and out of). that´s a plus in my book.Overall: 8/10, definitely recommended. And a must-have for everyone who enjoys the more convoluted gameplay if ARMA.			"

												I tried to get into it. I really did. I completed the training (the grenade training where you switch grenade types was buggy. It took restarting a few times for it to work) and did ok with that.My large gripe with this game is that it's hard to connect to a multiplayer server which is the point of this game. It's a multiplayer game. Loading the game and going to multiplayer doesn't find a single server through steam. To attempt to connect to one, you have to quit the game completely, closing all open AA3 windows and go to Steam>View>Servers and try to connect to one through there. Most of the time the servers don't respond.Therefore for a multiplayer game with servers that are hard to connect to, I simply cannot recommend it until the designers or Steam or someone gets their act together and fixes it.

												Felt Very slow, clumsy, and unrefined. Seems like it was thrown together and the devs seemed to ignore everyone in the community, even their own beta members. Solders moved like they where 80yrs old and constantly got stuck on random things on the ground in half the maps. Skip this and pick up Americas Army Proving Grounds. Seems like AA2.0 was better than this one, all the main people i knew went back to the old AA just to get off this broken one. If your looking for a New Americas Army i sugguest skipping this one and going straight to Americas Army Proving Grounds, ITS MILES better!			"

												Not bad for a free military simulator, of course you can't compare it to Operation Flashpoint or Armed Assault (ArmA), but it's also good.Few bad things are:You're always American. You see your teammates as USMC soldiers and your enemies as Nocza Militarni zo ta Ekspedi (NME) - fictional military organization. Your enemies see themselves as USMC and they see you with your team as NME. This is a pure American propaganda and I don't like it, but I guess it's called ""America's"" Army for a reason. But you should be able to play as NME too!Small maps. The only map with a decent size is the ""Ranch"" map, but it's small too, just kinda bigger than the other maps. Bigger maps are what this game needs, especially for the VIP operations.Dumb movement. The player movement just feels... weird.Overall: 7.5/10			"

												America's Army, for me, is one of the greatest free to play shooters out there. It may be slightly dated to todays standard, but its still a great ride. Not only was the game free, but it held a unique and outstanding weapon system. The game also kept you immersed and pumped for what ever layed over the hill, or around the next corner. My adrenalin has only gone so far in S.T.A.L.K.E.R and a competitve match on CS:GO, but keep in mind, this game is free. Event though there is a sequal that is currently in beta right here on steam, the third entry is, and will always be, the greteast of them all.			"

												America's Army as a series is among the better tactical FPSs. It uniquely simulates weapon malfunctions and offers a more detailed medical treatment system than other (unmodded) games, requiring certain treatments for certain injuries. Its default control layout is my favorite. AA3 is a net downgrade from AA2. Its training missions don't cover as many skills and tasks, its weapons selection is more limited (exclusively to M16 variants and the M249), It has no vehicles, no breeching, and no jumping. The weapons will occasionaly glitch out and become inoperable (not refering to the simulated malfunctions, but a game defect that hasn't been and likely won't ever be resolved).In its favor, AI has been added as an optional opposing force.My favorite AA remains AA2, and I recommend it over AA3 and AAPG.http://aao25.com/Ultimately, all AA titles are inferior to Real Virtuality engine titles like VBS / ARMA / OFP , which militaries and more serious gaming communities use. If you have the money, purchase an Arma game.			"

												As a huge fan of America's Army 1 and 2, I was very excited to see my favorite series get the DirectX10 makeover with great graphics. However what I got in return was disappointment and sadness, however I still enjoy it here and there.This game has more bugs than a European bed, from graphical errors, to random crashes, the bugs actually cause player deterrance. Aside from all the issues, the multiplayer [concept] is still decent, and the training is fantastic. The new methods of reviving teammates is a lot more realistically immersive but still isn't a good enough reason to keep playing this game for most people. However, I will keep playing.Hopefully they'll fix it up in the next year or so, til then, heed my warnings. It's buggy as hell, but still provides some of the same old AA fun from the past.			"

The game is basically a big game of search and destroy from Call of Duty so if you die you do die and don't respawn until next round. I beleive there is a better version of this game from the same company but don't quote me on that. If you want a more realistic free to play FPS then I guess this is the game for you. Though there are better free to play FPS games out there in my opinion. So I would rate this game a 7/10			"

												America's Army 3 doesn't have typical gameplay from normal first-person shooters such as the Call of Duty series. It's more difficult to charge in head-on to the enemy as your body armor can only take 1-2 shots before being broken and leaving yourself unprotected. The use of cover is one of the many things that will save you when playing this game, and it slows down the pace of the game itself as you have to move from cover to cover, suppress the enemy, deploy smoke, etc.... For a newcomer to America's Army 3, I would recommend going over the training courses before stepping into a pvp match because the controls are a bit complicated. The one thing that I hope would be fixed on here is the introduction of new weapons and a better class system because there are far too many times that every match I go in, people tend to choose the Squad Designated Marksman role and the only ones left are the rifleman, grenadier, and automatic rifleman.

												This is probably the best version of America's Army hands down. The new proving grounds is like a whole new game and the graphics are way different. Ugly in my opinion. Americas Army 3 on the other hand has a small dedicated following of people. Small is Small too there are typiclly 15 - 20 servers running but only 60 people tops. The community sticks to the well known servers such as 312 or UWS and has a broad spectrum of people from across the globe. At any given moment you have Russians, Americans, French, and Australians, all having a good time killing each other. There is a learning curve if you are new. Best advice is to take the single player training because its integral to the game. A microphone is also recommended in order to communicate with your team more effectivly. This game is about communication and teamwork as much as it is running and shooting.			"

												America's Army, for me, is one of the greatest free to play shooters out there. It may be slightly dated to todays standard, but its still a great ride. Not only was the game free, but it held a unique and outstanding weapon system. The game also kept you immersed and pumped for what ever layed over the hill, or around the next corner. My adrenalin has only gone so far in S.T.A.L.K.E.R and a competitve match on CS:GO, but keep in mind, this game is free. Event though there is a sequal that is currently in beta right here on steam, the third entry is, and will always be, the greteast of them all.			"

												America's Army as a series is among the better tactical FPSs. It uniquely simulates weapon malfunctions and offers a more detailed medical treatment system than other (unmodded) games, requiring certain treatments for certain injuries. Its default control layout is my favorite. AA3 is a net downgrade from AA2. Its training missions don't cover as many skills and tasks, its weapons selection is more limited (exclusively to M16 variants and the M249), It has no vehicles, no breeching, and no jumping. The weapons will occasionaly glitch out and become inoperable (not refering to the simulated malfunctions, but a game defect that hasn't been and likely won't ever be resolved).In its favor, AI has been added as an optional opposing force.My favorite AA remains AA2, and I recommend it over AA3 and AAPG.http://aao25.com/Ultimately, all AA titles are inferior to Real Virtuality engine titles like VBS / ARMA / OFP , which militaries and more serious gaming communities use. If you have the money, purchase an Arma game.			"

Its got a lot of realism going for it, which is nice, but what it lacks is CONTENT. theres a few maps, and like 2 guns max per class, with like one modification. theres a bit of a lag issue sometimes, might just be me, but usually is quite smooth and good. I'd be willing to give it a 4 if the developers added some content once in a while. (and you know, if the content was good and added to the gameplay) "

												This game is fun for a free to play, however it killed/replaced a far better game... Americas Army 2.8.5. I would give my first born to have the old America's Army back. AA3 is buggy and not nearly as fluid/well built as it AA2.8.5. Half the time you can unload in someone and the bullets simply not register. You must be in a particular mood to play this game or you will find yourself raging quite hard. All in all it's fun but I'd much rather have AA2 back. So if you're reading this AA developers. PLEASE BRING IT BACK. I promise I'm not the only one who wants AA2 instead of this half built game.			"

												So far dar has been so many 2+ gig downloads for this game and across the last few months I've barely played this game at all....considering I've played AA since it's inception. I find it incredibly hard, almost impossible for me to ever give any AA edition, any bad rating, or unfair critique, Oorah... And so for the record. This edition of AA is possibly the worst to date, but even so, I give it my full thumbs up and I hope, when I go to actually play this and more in-depth, a more promising past time wit it, then my past times with earlier versions emerges, however. I doubt it, but hell, here's hoping.    "

												3/5I give a lot of 3/5s.its a nice middle score for games that dont stand out to me, but aren't terrible. Thats what America's army 3 is. Its got a lot of realism going for it, which is nice, but what it lacks is CONTENT. theres a few maps, and like 2 guns max per class, with like one modification. theres a bit of a lag issue sometimes, might just be me, but usually is quite smooth and good. I'd be willing to give it a 4 if the developers added some content once in a while. (and you know, if the content was good and added to the gameplay) "

You will complete missions like securing weapon caches, escorting VIPs, and retrieving briefcases with intelligence. The tutorial or boot camp covers all the controls and the learning curve is low so you can jump right into the game. I would recommend this game if you are into military simulators but it is not that good. 8.4/10			"

												《穿越火线》（Cross Fire，简称CF）由韩国Smile Gate开发，在韩国由Neowiz发行，在中国大陆由腾讯公司运营。《穿越火线》是一款第一人称射击游戏的网络游中文名穿越火线 原版名称CrossFire 其他名称CF 游戏类型动作，第一人称射击 游戏平台Microsoft Windows 开发商Smile Gate，Neowiz 发行商Neowiz，腾讯游戏，Gamerage等 发行日期2007年5月3日 游戏画面3D 游戏引擎LithTech引擎 最新版本3.3.0（2001年5月26日） 主要角色赛斯，奥摩，斯沃特，猎狐者，飞虎队，灵狐者，刀锋，潘多拉 游戏评级Teen（ESRB）、全年龄（中国） 形象代言人谢霆锋 目录1 阵营背景 ▪ 潜伏者 ▪ 保卫者 2 配置要求 3 角色介绍 ▪ 常规角色 ▪ 生化角色 ▪ 挑战角色 4 特色系统 ▪ 道具系统 ▪ 互动系统 ▪ 安全系统 ▪ 荣誉系统 5 武器装备 6 战斗模式 7 游戏地图 ▪ 团队爆破模式 ▪ 团队竞技模式 ▪ 幽灵模式 ▪ 歼灭模式 ▪ 生化模式 ▪ 挑战模式 8 游戏评测 9 游戏操作 10 游戏代理  阵营背景编辑 潜伏者没有人知道究竟是谁创建了潜伏者雇佣兵公司，也没有人知道它的总部究竟在哪里。有人说它是为第三世界国家服务，也有人声称它曾为叛军执行“特殊任务”。然而至今为止，无人找到这家公司的负责人，甚至没有任何法律可以约束到它。但至少有一点每个人都清楚：潜伏者从不为强国服务。有人说，潜伏者的成员身上流动的是野性的血——这让他们愿意为弱小国家服务，甚至执行某些“特殊服务”。但对于外人来说，有关他们的一切都仅仅是猜测罢了。 保卫者早在保卫者佣兵公司成立之初，便开始公开招募从各个著名特种部队中退役的队员。这家佣兵公司以维护和平为名义，服务于强势国家。他们宣称自己拥有最正义的立场，如果战斗违背了他们的信念，即使有再多金钱的诱惑，他们也决不为所动。然而，保卫者从不透露他们进行的每一场战斗的具体情况，甚至对内部成员也不愿多说。因此，他们公开宣称的一场场“正义”行动受到了越来越多人的质疑。很快，外界开始指责他们是强势国家和大型财团的工具。甚至更有传言说，因为在保卫者佣兵公司的所作所为违背了自己的理想,许多优秀队员黯然离开了这家公司。[1]  戏，玩家扮演控制一名持枪战斗人员，与其他玩家进行械斗。背包：玩家可以根据自己的喜好选择武器，每次开始新回合或复活时都可以通过更换背包来换取合适的整套装备，每个玩家最多可使用五个背包（默认为2个，其它背包需自行购买）。“极限战斗背包”（只能通过幻影道具卡获得）可以使玩家在挑战模式中随意切换背包。装扮：玩家可以根据自己的军衔和成绩装扮自己。道具推荐：玩家在频道选择画面中的推荐道具可以查看推荐道具的说明，并可以直接购买相应道具。 互动系统社区交流：社区战队、好友系统、拒绝目录等基础的社区功能外，并且通过好友间聊天了解对方的位置信息。战友推荐：新玩家进入游戏后，可推荐一名老玩家为自己的战友（每个新玩家只能推荐一名战友），推荐成功后，新玩家获得一定的道具奖励及经验加成，被推荐的老玩家在新玩家获得经验时按一定比例获得FP点数，FP点数可购买稀有道具。新玩家等级到达少尉后，双方战友关系自动结束，成为荣誉战友。（战友关系建立后，不可自行删除。）对讲机：对讲机功能进入战局后，会自动进入所在阵营的对讲机频道，界面左下方出现对讲机的小界面。同一方的队友都在一个频道内。跟现实中的对讲机一样，CF对讲机是按键说话的，按住V键就说，不按就停止语音信息传递。当玩家使用“对讲机”讲话时，画面中麦克风的提示条会跳动，显示当前的说话状态。对讲机会显示正在说话的人，可以迅速知道是哪个队友的求援，即时做出战术反映。对讲机通过特色的电池槽设计，避免某个玩家长时间占用语音频道：每个玩家初始拥有10秒的电量用来发言。当发言时消耗对应时间的电量；当电量耗尽时则不可发言。当发言停止时电池会自动充电，1s充电量为1s。 武器装备编辑步枪M4A1百合 56式步枪 CR21风暴 MK18蓝海 纯金M4A1 M14EBR天羽 沙鹰修罗 M4A1-翔龙 M4A1-火鹰 M4A1-黑龙 M4A1-黑骑士 M4A1-雷神 AR-15 09式狙击步枪 G3A3 VHS突击步枪 AK47-苍龙 SS2 M4A1-圣诞2013 黄金AK XM8 AK47 M4A1-Custom M14自动步枪 M14EBR RX4风暴 XM8-A FAD突击步枪 温彻斯特 AN94 QBZ95 M4A1-黑虎 大毒蛇ACR 圣诞AK47 CM901 M4A1-S 红龙AK47 圣诞M4A1 黄金M4A1 M4A1-隐袭 M4A1-轻骑兵 89式突击步枪 M4A1-A M4A1-狼牙 AK47-狼牙 AK47-黑锋 L85A1 AK-103 Ruger MINI-14 M16-S TAR21 赤焰CR-21 M4A1-红魔 AK47-S 火麒麟-AK[8]   糕的是，这条重要信息被敌对组织			"

I get spammed from ARMY and other emails aswell as other things trying to get me to join.  its not even good at any level.  Reminds me of games from the 90s...

												In America's Army 3, you will be playing as a US infantryman deployed in the fictional state of Czervenia. You will complete missions like securing weapon caches, escorting VIPs, and retrieving briefcases with intelligence. The tutorial or boot camp covers all the controls and the learning curve is low so you can jump right into the game. I would recommend this game if you are into military simulators but it is not that good. 8.4/10			"

												What I find interesting here is that the American military has sooo overextended themselves  that they actually develop a video game that  is used as an army recruitment tool. I think it's the first time for any armed force on the planet to use tax dollars to make video games, to in turn glorify war, to in turn increase recruitment, to in turn start more wars.and Americans wonder why there country is broke?

If you're coming fresh-faced and this is the first America's Army game you are going to play this is what I have to tell you; It's a free game and it runs pretty well (Not superb, but pretty well) but as a very famous person once said.. Time is money. And this is a waste of your time.			"

												AA3 delivers an exciting tactical-shooter experience.  Team work is essential to victory.  One wrong move and you suffer the consequences.  If you like Insurgency, you'll like AA3, too.  Advancing through training is a unique and challenging aspect to the game that adds a sense of accomplishment.It's free-to-play and a proper FTP game at that; besides, their budget is set by the US Army itself.

												Theres nothing I love more than my countries brave soldiers, they are my heroes, no capes, they are the badasses of the US and they truly show that. Though this game COULD do a good job at showing that if the community wasnt bad.. No one likes to work together just straight camping and next to no teamwork. This game could be good if everyone would come together and do something tactical, realistic, and it may cost money while this game is free but just buy a game thats a good representation of our nations military, where theres a more active and possibly better community, its gonna be hard to find a game thats accurate, realistic and with a thriving friendly community of active players. If you have a full squad of friends who will play this with you then by all means try it because atleast your friends would stick together, play tactically, not be dumb, and be friendly right? give it a try since its free but I just cant recommend this game.

												Even though this game is good in some way, I have a big problem with it: PROPAGANDA. Playing this supports an army that isn't interested in bringing peace to the world, but instead trys to gain resources for their country. So think a second before playing it.			"

												As a soldier for the empire i can confirm that this game is fun. Is it as fun as shooting real tuskan raiders in real life, No.Why you ask? I actually end up hitting my target this time.The armor is funny too. It's not white, and for some reason the desert map doesnt have 2 suns. No wamp rats either.			"

												Not as good as these brownies but still a pretty good gamebrownies: chocolate Chip Cookie Dough BrowniesIngredients:BROWNIE LAYER:3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter1 1/2 cups bittersweet chocolate chips1 cup granulated white sugar1/2 cup packed light brown sugar4 large eggs1 teaspoon vanilla extract1/2 teaspoon salt1 cup all-purpose flourCOOKIE DOUGH:3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature or almost melted3/4 cup granulated white sugar3/4 cup packed light brown sugar1/4 teaspoon salt2 tablespoons milk or cream1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste1 cup all-purpose flour1 cup miniature chocolate chipsadditional miniature chocolate chips, if desired (to garnish the top)Directions:Prepare the brownie layer-1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9x9-inch pan with nonstick spray, then line with a strip of parchment paper so that it covers the bottom and comes up two sides of the pan. Spray the parchment with nonstick spray too.2. In a microwave safe bowl (or in the top of a double boiler or pan set on top of a pan of simmering water), microwave in 30 second bursts to melt butter and chocolate chips together until all is melted and smooth. Whisk in the sugars, then whisk in the eggs, vanilla and salt. Sift flour into the bowl and stir that in too. Scrape the brownie batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the brownie layer is cooked through (toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean). Place the pan of brownies in the refrigerator to speed up the cooling process (or cool at room temperature and add the cookie dough layer later).Prepare the cookie dough layer:3. In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to combine the butter, sugars and salt until soft and creamy (1 to 2 minutes). Mix in the milk and vanilla. Sprinkle in the flour and mix in until combined. Stir in the 1 cup of chocolate chips. Scoop the cookie dough onto the top of the brownies and spread onto the brownie layer. I find that it's easiest to do this if the brownie layer is chilled and firm. Wet your hands or spray them with nonstick spray and pat the cookie dough on top in a even layer. Sprinkle additional chocolate chips on top to create a nicer, visual appearance. For easy, clean cutting, chill the brownies (wrap the brownies with plastic wrap and chill until firm- 1 to 2 hours or up to 2 days).4. Cut the brownies: Run a knife along the sides of the brownie pan and then use the parchment paper to lift the brownies from the pan and onto a cutting board. Slice the brownies with a sharp knife, wiping the knife with a paper towel between cuts. If you'd like all of your slices of brownies to look clean-cut without edges, use the knife to cut the sides of the brownies off before cutting pieces. Keep brownies slices covered and chilled until ready to serve.			"

												America's Army, a propaganda game. That alone should make you run from it. This was a game strictly developed to highlight military life and to give more reason for children to want to join up. Is the military a bad thing? Depends what country you live in. Either way this is not a game for many to play, it's extremely basic and does show some more realistic properities to than most games similar to it. If anything go play Call of Duty or Combat Arms. It's just about the same thing, and at least there you won't be forced to watch propaganda videos that want to indoctrinate you and force feed you crap. Plus in those games the community is alive, unlike this one where it's nearly non-existant.			"
