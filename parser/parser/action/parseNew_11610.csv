												DO NOT GIVE MONEY TO THIS GAME THROUGH STEAM.  IF YOU DECIDE TO GIVE MONEY TO THIS COMPANY (and I wouldnt advise it.) ONLY USE PREPAID CARDS.The reason for this is if you pay anyway other than prepaid you will get NX credit instead of NX prepaid. Why does it matter? Because you cant buy anything with NX credit (well nothing you would ever want to buy at least).  No you will not get a refund and no there is no way to transfer the NX you bought into a useable form. Please either upvote this review or put an advisory about this in your own review so that people are aware of this when decideing if and how they want to spend money on this game.Thanks			"

												If you're looking for a really fast action MMO, then this is the game for you. It starts off a bit slow but once you select your first class specialization(ie. Warrior-->Barbarian, Mage-->Fire Mage) the game becomes much more intense. The combat is easily the highlight of this game; the feeling of decimating a battlefield with 30 enemies on screen with a giant AoE attack is great! I only feel the character customization is lacking... Options for hair and faces feel limited and classes are gender-locked, so if you want to play as a male Archer, you're outta luck. Overall it's a pretty solid MMO with plenty of dungeons to try your hand at.4/5			"

												Overall a very fun game. However playing solo can be quite boring sometimes so it's best if you get someone to join with you.As with all games there are pros and cons, the most annoying cons I have found are the gender locked classes, and that certain cash items have to be bought with NX Prepaid (using cards etc.) not with NX Credit (using your credit/debit card and steam cash). Other than that the game is quite enjoyable, and isn't entirely a p2w game like most so called f2p games are.As for PVP, pretty much anyone stands a chance at being good no matter what character they have, it all comes down to skill. Though according to various forums some classes are better than others, but I disagree as I have watched so called OP classes get absolutely destroyed by the so called lower PVP classes.The quests and levelling system can be quite grindy and repetitive at times, but if you're with a friend you dont really mind quite as much since you clear the dungeons quite quickly, most of the time in under 5mins.I highly recommend this game for anyone to try. I was quite sceptical to begin with but have quickly become addicted to playing.			"

												[Note: this review was so long, it had to be continued in comments - see first reply by me for part 2. Also note that this is not your traditional dot point pro/con 5 second review. This is an editorial piece telling the story of how I fell in love with this amazing game.]Although I like to consider myself a true gamer-girl through and through, I have to admit that there was one single genre I'd never tried - an MMO. The whole ""pay to play"" thing was a huge hurdle for me when I was a child, and so despite my fascination with the idea of such a large, virtual community, everquest and the like were always out of reach. Fast-forward a decade and times have unsurprisingly changed. With nearly all MMO games becoming free to play, I finally had a chance to try out this genre that had piqued my interest for oh so many years. So around December 2012, I bit the bullet and started trawling through free-to-play MMO's, to see what all the fuss was about. And I have to admit, my first choices did not live up to my expectations. I tried games like Mabinogi and Rose online, but the combat just felt totally clunky and painful. There was little in the way of moving and dodging, with most of the focus simply being on casting skills with incredibly long cast times, and even longer cooldowns. Or alternatively,  just whacking something with a stick over and over ad nauseum, before it keeled over and died. The graphics were bland, the enemies were repetitive, and the story seemed non-existant.  I was beginning to think that I'd been seriously mislead about the nature of MMO's, and that they were all essentially just fancy IRC rooms.But then I installed a lil game called Dragon Nest. Like my previous choices, I spent a large amount of time tinkering around in the character creator, eventually choosing a class called - wait for it - tinkerer. This is a cute little girl of about 13, who, when given the twin pigtail hairstyle, beared more than a striking resemblence to me at that age. The similarities were quite uncanny, which immediately grabbed my attention. Instead of roleplaying, I was simply getting to relive my youthful days as a young teen - something which meant a lot to me, being in my late 20's and utterly depressed at the fact that I'm not far off my thirties. But the other games had nice character creations too, only to be let down by the game itself. So I wasn't all that optimistic about this game either. My pessimism was shattered the instant I entered the game world. After a short introduction scene, I found myself in a beautiful snowy town, decorated with x-mas items and a nice big christmas tree at the centre of town, along with some really cheery christmas-y music. Not only this, but I saw many other characters running around - lil tinkerers like myself, sorcerers, and some rather charming looking clerics. The whole place was very pleasant and inviting, and I really felt a warm welcome to the game and the community as a whole.As I ambled around the town, obtaining main story quests as well as side quests, I noticed that the story behind this game was very well executed, with lots of voice acting on all the main NPC's - a welcome change from static walls of text from mute characters that I'd encountered in nearly all my previous MMO games up to this point. I was also approached by a polite warrior gentlemen, whom, upon noting my newbie status, kindly started explaining many of the concepts of the game to me. He also invited me into his guild, which I was somewhat hesitant about as I didn't feel I would be of any use as a newbie. He assured me it was fine, and that anyone was welcome. I'm glad I accepted the offer because I went on to meet many wonderful people, who taught me a great deal about the game and were more than willing to help me complete tasks on many occasions. Initially however, I chose to complete the dungeons solo, just to get a feel for the combat in this game. This isn't really an open world MMO, you simply have a town with many quests available, and then you have a closed instance field outside of the town for you (and any party members), with several dungeons being accessible from that field. This makes the game suitable for a wide audience, without needing too powerful of a computer (although don't get me wrong, the graphics are very pleasant too!). Upon entering my first dungeon was my next pleasant surprise. The combat in this game is amazing! It was how I'd imagined all MMO's would play, prior to actually playing them. I've been told this style is called an action MMO, and it plays somewhat like a first person shooter / third person shooter, with a huge emphasis on reaction times, dodging, combo'ing, as well as carefully choosing the most ideal order in which to carry out attacks. It's very frantic, but also very rewarding. It's easy to pick up, but very hard to master. Having tried other apparent action MMO's, I have to say that Dragon Nest hands down has the best combat I've ever experienced - it's THAT satisfying. I continued playing through about the first ten levels, but I was alone and in truth the game didn't feel that much different to single player RPG's that I'd played. This all changed when, upon my next visit to town, I was invited to my first party. I think this was the point where the game stole my heart, and I knew that I was going to be playing this for a long time. In fact, I ended up playing for 24 hours straight that very day, it was *that* endearing to me. The game promotes teamwork heavily, with many abilities to help each other out in the form of buffs, debuffs, heals and the like. Not only this, but it was just simply fun to feel a part of something so grand. Even just chatting in town (which we ended up doing for hours) was immensely satisfying, and I met over 30 friends in that first day alone. From this point on, the game consumed me - I played it all day, everyday, whenever I had the free time to do so.  I was really eager to see what would happen next in the main story, while at the same time being happy to party with those of similar level (or even help those at lower level catch up to me). Before I knew it, my friends list was maxed out at 100. I had to tell people to add me and just send me a message whenever they wanted to party, as I had no room left on my list. Such friendships made me feel really happy - something that had been sorely lacking in my real life ever since an incident that left me scarred with PTSD, during which some brutish man tried to kill me (literally) over a road rage incident. He very nearly succeeded too, as he pushed my car towards a tree at 100 miles an hour, which I missed by mere inches. But I digress, this review is about the game not my own injustices.  I merely wished to portray that my friends here really helped me come a long way to recovering from this incident. So back to the game now - at this point I was steadily getting through quests and making my way towards the level cap. So now is probably a good time to talk about the ""pay"" features that you have in any free to play MMO. Dragon Nest adheres to the policy of paid items being primarily cosmetic in function - this is not a ""pay 2 win"" game, and there are many well known players who have not paid anything for the game at all, whom are still some of the most powerful and well-geared characters on the server. Of the few items that *do* help make a character more powerful (namely jellies for enhancing items, and stamps for allowing to sell certain high grade items on the market) both of these may be purchased from other players with in-game gold, negating the need to spend real world cash. [Part 2 of review continued in comments to this due to length restrictions. Please don't leave your own comments guys, it will ruin the order of my replies]			"

												For some clarification: I have played this game since Open Beta around September 2011, long before it was released on Steam so I'd average around maybe 5,000 hours give or take a thousand.This game used to be the greatest thing since sliced bread. The combat is phenomenol, still kind of is. The story is gripping although a little trope-y. Most if not all of the classes are unique in their own way, each having their own playstyle. Now why would I not recommend this game despite all the good things, it's only because the cons heavily outweigh the pros.Let's start with content. Content is one of the biggest concerns I have had with this game for a while. The level caps have increased from 16, 24, 32, 40, 50 etc., with each cap including a couple of small 'nests' which are more or less instances with 4-5 bosses with some mechanics built in, a raid which is essentially like the nests only with 8 people instead of 4 and then the hell raid which adds a couple mechanics and makes everything stronger. Each cap lasts about 5-8 months with the exception of 40 cap which lasted nearly a year and some odd months. These months are filled with grinding the same dungeons and 'nests' week to week to try to get the best gear.Now we'll talk about gear. Gear follows a familiar rarity system, Normal, Magic, Rare, Epic, Unique, and Legendary. Normal to Rare is highly disregarded when playing Dragon Nest, if you're seen wearing them you'll be kicked from a party without hesitation, but we'll get into community in a bit. Epic gear is obtained from doing the nests over and over again for materials to craft. There's usually 2 different Epic sets for each cap, one being for magic-based classes, the other being for physical based classes. Unique gear is obtained from completing the normal raid and getting it dropped randomly. Legendary gear is recieved from drops in the hell version of a raid. Essentially to get the best gear in the game you essentially have to just have immense luck, and not to mention a team which can actually clear a raid consistently. Gear does not change any part of attire except for your weapons, so if you're looking to be a fashionista without forking over some cash you're out of luck. When it comes to making your character not look like the average joe, you'll usually have to pay 15-30 dollars on a costume. A lot of the time you won't be able to mix-and-match costumes to get the ""ultimate"" look just based on the fact that you'll lose a set bonus. These set bonuses get better the more you pay up, and if you ever do feel the need to mix-and-match you'll have to get lucky buying gachapon and getting the single item that allows you to do so, did I mention you need one for each piece of equipment you wish to alter? That's not all, if you're looking to get the highest rarity costumes you'll need to fork over even more cash to get sets and fuse those set pieces together for a CHANCE at a higher rarity costume piece. Good luck!Class balancing is another of the bigger concerns with the game. Every so often there's a balancing patch, when this patch comes around there will ALWAYS be that one class that excells over all the others. This a lot of the time leads to people completely shunning other classes based on their tier list. And when it comes to nerfing a class, the nerf will just be making another class significantly more powerful than the other. If you're thinking about exclusively playing one class and still being able to join up with others then I'm sorry to say that's not the case. Let's get to talking about the community. It's a fairly small game so the community is kind of scrunched up. A lot of the people are generally really nice, but when it comes to actually playing the game, personalities may be a bit skewed. A fair bit of players, especially the people who have been around for a long while, which make up a fair portion of the game, are elitist in one way or another. There is a list of requirements for joining parties ranging from having proper gear, the highest enchantments, the best gems, etc. It doesn't matter if you're trying to learn how to do the latest nest or something to that extent, you will be kicked on the spot if the party leader is not appeased by your gear. This game is without a doubt not friendly to new players, I hate to say.PVP is one of the few things this game has left to offer, and even in that case PVP has had an incessive lag since the game was released till now.I could keep going on and on about all the problems with the game, but I feel I've covered the bare essentials. A couple years ago I would've recommended this game, but unfortunately it just fell into the usual Korean MMO loop of unfortunate cases.			"

												Note: This review is a bit outdated (It was made at around 70 cap). Some of my complaints might have been addressed at this point but I have not played the game recently so I cannot tell for myself. Fundamentally this review is still accurate though.My steam time for this game is not accurate. I likely have at the very minimum 1,500~ hours in game.tl;dr: Gameplay is solid and suprisingly good with a reasonable amount of depth. However, the grind from lowest level to max level (even with someone grinding you) can be nigh unbearable. The games optimization is hit-or-miss with many players computers as the optimization seems to be based on CPU power with it hardly if at all utilizing the GPU. In terms of class-to-class balance, the actual devs are fairly incompetent at making sure one class doesn't completely dominate the others.In depthGameplay:The gameplay of Dragon-nest is primarily fast-paced combat with heavy reliance on reflexes, ability to predict the enemy movements, and knowing your own skills. The combat has no casting bars rather relying on animations which makes you feel as though you are 'in control'. Many of the higher level skills do a satisfying amount of damage in PvE and a reasonable amount in PvP. In my experience, the end-game content (Dragon nests) often devolve DPS races to blow up the boss before it has a chance to do any of it's harder mechanics. Simply getting hit by some of these bosses could result in an instant death for you. Note: In the end-game content, after you die, you are dead until the raid (called 'nest' ingame) is complete or your entire party dies.PVP:PVP deserves it's own section because for many players it is simply all that matters in the game. PVP is largely player-skill based as a highly skilled player can easily combo the other player to death, giving the other player no opportunities to fight back. There are a few types of PVP in Dragon Nest which I will describe quite simply. There is Ladder, Endless, 1v1, and blacklisted 1v1.Ladder is what many players might call 'competitive' mode with a rating, but in reality, it is simply an infestation of a single class. Gear plays a role in this mode and for many PVP'ers, no one actually cares about it, since gauging it as a metric of skill is completely stupid.Endless is simply 8v8 combat. Given its playercount, it is easily the laggiest mode for many players and, simply put, is a mind-less cesspool of high AOE skill-spamming. Gear does not matter.1v1 is what it is. Gear does not matter.Blacklisted 1v1 is different from what you might expect it to be. To give it a bit of a background, many players view some skills as overpowered compared to other skills (example: A mercenary's 'Iron Skin'). Most classes have a few of these skills and players will mutally agree to not use these skills. For some players, Blacklisted 1v1 might include entire classes or very specific rulesets and for many players, what is blacklisted to someone might not be blacklisted to the other. Most 'legitimate PVP'ers' play this.One other 'important' aspect about PVP is PVP rank. PVP rank is arguably important because there is an icon associated with your rank. Initially, it is a brown egg icon next to your name. As you PVP more, you get more experience and the icon changes. The other icons are blue (silver) and yellow (gold). However, be warned, the blue and yellow icons are EXTREMELY difficult to attain as they are exclusive to a certain rising XP threshold. It is difficult to describe in words but simply put, if you were to attempt to become the player with the #1 amount of experience, it would easily take you a year of pvp'ing to get even close to it.Sound:The sounds of Dragon Nest are fairly average I would personally say, although, one of the key issues many players seem to have is that the voice-actors for some of the classes are borderline cringeworthy, prompting some users to completely disable the voice or download a foriegn language voice mod. Another one of the issues and to many players and advantage is that most if not all the skills have their own special voice-line for casting that spell. This means when your Adept (that's a class) casts Inject, every single time you are going to hear what sounds like a child say, ""This might sting a bit!"" Graphics:The graphics are good and fantastic for many of the skills. However, some classes and raids (nests) in particular have crippling effects on many player's computers. One class in particular, the Alchemist, has a few spells that are strong in PvP simply because for many players, casting it is 'like opening six movies at the exact same time', resulting in a crippling half-second burst of lag.Community:The community of Dragon Nest is fairly odd. A mix of Anime fanatics and normal people coupled with a loud creepy population. The population seems to be a mix of 12 to 19 year olds with some guilds greatly skewing this margin. I highly recommend finding a guild that suits your playstyle rather than joining one of the ones that you get invited to right off the bat. The best way to do that is make a friend in-game and try their guild. Server & Game Issues:The server occasionally seems to have frustrating issues with lag. Sometimes these issues are extremely frustrating as they might completely void and entire 'nest', leading to a player missing out on loot. One of the most notable issues is the completely unavoidable 'Hackshield', and instant kick from the game resulting in the failure of the games anti-cheat. It is not detecting a false-positive, merely it just messes up.Pay-to-win Factor:Suprisingly, this game isn't nearly as pay to win as I expected. The only pay-2-win'ish factor seems to be Dragon eggs and, even then, the only good thing that comes from them is wings which boost your characters movement speed in everything but PVP. When it comes to costumes, 'green' costumes boost stats which can pretty much only be purchased through NX (real life money). However, 'blue' costumes which boost stats much greater than 'green' costumes can only be reliably purchased through large amounts of ingame gold.Overall: The game is suprisingly good but has a good few problems that detract from some of the good parts. The game seems to have a large issue when it comes to grinding of either money or levels. There are minor issues with the community regarding it's vocal immature side.			"

												[EDIT: Dragon Nest is not associated with Nexon anymore. Although this review is outdated, the leveling guide is still updated. Please take a look at that.]*A LENGTHY REVIEW*Background Information:Dragon Nest is a free-to-play fantasy MMORPG published by Nexon NA (Steam Version). Play Style/Game PlayIt uses a non-targeting combat system (which most MMORPG have), so basically you have full control of the players movement using the keys ""W, A, S, D"". You are able to use your skills using the short cut keys ""1-10"" or change your key bindings to see which better suits you. Dragon nest consists of 2 game modes or 2 of both, PvP and PvE. You start off as PvE but later through the levels you can change to PvP or do both. The game consists of 8 Characters of which they have their own unique skills and abilities. ClassesClasses have 'specialisations' where they can change into their first and second job and focus on that particular area of combat. Specialisations are granted at level 15 and level 44. The 8 classes include: Warrior Archer Cleric Sorceress  Tinkerer Kali Assassin LanceaFor more information of the classes and what specialisations they have go to the Nexon website @ http://dragonnest.nexon.net/guides/class-guideLike every game they have their pros and their cons. Here are mine:Pros:+Gameplay system. The choice of movement and mechanics are great+Community. Everyone is nice but you do get the occasional person that isn't so nice+Exp rate. There are so many opportunities you get with bonus exp to level up your character as fast as possible+Simple. Easy to learn but takes practice to learn the mechanics of the characters. Practice makes perfectCons:-The lack of designing your character. The class you choose has already determined of what type and style you are. You don't really have that much of a choice to change your personal features, and the gender has been set to that class.-Repetitive. The game can get a little repetitive at times, doing the same dungeons over and over again. But it isn't really that much of a bother if you have a friend to play with youOverallI've played Dragon Nest when it was in Beta, but I've kept quitting and coming back 3 times. I've finally stuck with the game. Leveling can be hard at times and you have no choice but to the grind to get to the level you desire, but that's with most MMORPGs. When I reached the level cap, I thought it was worth all the hard times of grinding. You'll think that reaching the max level will be the end, but it's a whole new chapter and there are far more things to do and goals to be set.Here's my friend's guide for leveling:

												Hi everyone, this is honestly more personal than anyting but I want someone to hear me out and maybe find someone who can relate to me.I reviewed this game a few years back in 2013, and recommended it but now that has changed. Dragon Nest now is not the same game compared to the launch date 2010-2015. Let me list my basic points.- Difficulty of the game• Removal of difficulty modes such as Hard, Master, Abyss in multiple dungeons• Monsters and Bosses dying upon one hit• The ability to level up quickly and surpass the area/nest/quest, essentially posing no challenge for players- Nests• The removal of nest such as the Level 32 Cerebus Nest or Level 40 Apocalyse Nest- Removal of Items• Due to the removal of nest, players can no longer find or craft armor exclusive to the nest for their level,items include: Elf Queen set or Cerebus set • Generic and general armor pieces with the rarity of Rare and Epic, the lack of oppertunity to enchance armor found unless it is of the Epic rarityIn conclusion the game was reworked where it was no longer about the journey, but the ending. This is not how any MMORPG should function. What lead to these changes and why? Dragon Nest has, been, is and remain my favorite MMORPG, no other game will beat the charm this game had and the memories I had created. It is extremely sad and disappointing to see what has happened to it in just 2 years. This game got me into gaming, and kept me in gaming but now I can only reflect on what the game was but no longer have the ability to replay and relive those moments again.Thank you for reading, I wish this for this to reach out to the game makers/company/publisher or anyone who will just hear me out as someone who has been apart of Dragon Nest since 2011.

What is this gameDragon Nest is a Free to Play MMO Action RPG with an anime-like art style. This game features fast paced combat, skill shot/aiming mechanics and 8 different classes. Unlike WoW or many other MMOs, the game isn’t open world, and most of everything is instance based.ClassesAssassin: Deadly martial artist that deals burst dmg. Builds Str and Agi. Shinobi: Focuses more on dealing phys dmg. Taoist: Focuses more on supporting allies with Light and Dark powersKali: Spiritual dancer that debuffs enemies and supports allies. Builds Str and Int. Dancer: Focuses more on dealing damage. Screamer: Focuses more on debuffing and buffing.Sorceress: Female mage class that deals magic damage (Duh). Builds Int. Mystic: Focuses more on Dark and Light spells/dmg. Elementalist: Focuses more on Ice and Fire spells/dmg.Warrior: Melee sword fighter. Builds Str and Vit. Swordsman: Focuses on slash attacks. Mercenary: Focuses on knocking down enemies.Archer: Elf ranged bow class that focuses on dps (Duh). Builds Agi. Sharpshooter: Focuses on single target dps. Acrobat: Focuses on aerial combat.Cleric: Holy magic class that buffs allies and heals them. Builds Str and Vit. Paladin: Focuses on tanking up allies Priest: Focuses on healing allies.Tinkerer/Academic: Jack of all trades class. Builds Agi and Int. Engineer: Focuses on doing physical damage with robots and guns. Alchemist: Focuses on doing magical debuffs and supporting allies.Lencea: Spear/lance user thats not in the NA version as of the beginning of January 2015. Builds Str and Int.Why did I start playingA friend suggested that I and another friend should try this game out since he previously played it back in 2012. So I installed it, thinking it would one of those F2P games that I would play for 20 hours and stop playing. My friend had a Sorceress from before and my other friend made a Tinkerer, so I decided to make an Assassin. I specialized him to Taoist, leveled him to 20, and got bored with him. I saw that the Tinkerer can summon a giant robot and hit things with a giant wrench, which reminded me of Max from Dark Cloud 2, so I made one. When I got to choose a Job Specialization, my friend had previously made his an Engineer, so I made mine an Alchemist. This is when I really dove into the game, finding out that most of the Alchemist’s abilities are really fun to use. At level 45, I got to choose a second job specialization; the Adept’s increased Fire and Ice power or the Physician’s increased Poison and Healing power. I chose Physician because I like playing healers. Now I have 350+ hours in the game and probably not stopping soon. Why do I like this gameI like it mainly because it’s an action RPG with fast-paced fighting and I love action RPGs. This game is not a freemium at all and very little pay to win(costume items give very little stats, and you can buy item protection jellies and revives with real money).Why should/shouldn’t you play itWhile the gameplay is fun, I have many problems with it. Bandwagoning: Raid parties tend to favor certain classes/specs over others and instantly kick the ones that are not meta. My main class, Physician is one of those non-meta classes and I have trouble finding parties since people favor Light Bringers over Priests and Physicians. This is due to the whole “Light Party” meta that is pretty much centered around Light Bringers, Crusaders/Inquisitors and Light converted DPS classes.Bad model textures: The textures in my opinion are low quality and unappealing.Annoying voices: 80% characters in the game have very cheesy lines.The Tinkerer is a 11 year old girl: The Tinkerer is commonly referred as the “Loli Class,” and the fact that I main one makes me feel like a pedo. I just like their skillset that’s all. There many reasons why I feel people don’t play this game. First is the anime-esque art style, since a lot people dislike anime. Second is that the graphics’ quality is bad. Third is the niche community of mostly otakus and weeaboos. Overall what do thinkI really enjoy this game. I find the gameplay fun and interesting with a high amount of replay value. I would suggest people to at least try it out to see if you like it or not. This is a good game to delve into if you are bored, so I pretty much recommend this for people to play.			"

												There's something about Dragon Nest that sets it apart from Nexon's other major action-MMO title Vindictus. It certainly has the anime style charm to it and tons of humor behind many of its characters and quests. but I feel its easier to immerse myself into the game as a whole. The combat is fun and the while the classes are genderlocked you don't really mind that fact once you start playing. I will always come back to this game when I want my fill of hack and slash adventure!			"

												The graphics are adorable. The dialog of your character and the NPCs is hilarious. There are plenty of powerful and dazzling skills to spam. There are a huge number of quests to complete. You can journey through the game solo or with friends - I REALLY like games that give you both options. All in all, this is a very fun MMORPG that does a good job of combining pure action and RPG elements. It may take a bit of practice at first to get the hang of it but give it a chance and you won't regret it.			"

												Dragon Nest is an instance-based action RPG playing much like an arcade game with no targeting, a strict class tree, a less strict skill tree, and more or less no character customization whatsoever. For instance, all Tinkerers are time-travelers who somehow turned into adorable lolitas, and all Kalis are abundantly female spirit dancers with sweet, slightly shy temperaments and dead masters.Masters in their tribal ninja teachings, not BDSM masters. Moving along.Dragon Nest's English localization is -incredibly- well-done, with dialogue that is not only legible but actually full of character and humor. The voice acting is goofy, but in a way that lines up with the character in question. The child king is nasally and distinctly lacking a courtly presence, while the storage NPC constantly complains about the horrible things other people / you leave in storage. The marketplace NPC will insult you for being poor (regardless of how much money you are holding because he's so damn rich.)Dungeons have multiple difficulty settings, and the baddest♥♥♥♥♥dungeons are the titular Nests (though not necessarily dragon nests.) Abyss is the fourth and highest difficulty of any other dungeon, but it is the first difficulty of a Nest, and most of them have a Hell or Hardcore one that's much much harder than that. Nests are effectively your chokepoints for progress through the game, and at any given time one or more Nests will be the ""endgame"" dungeon. The catch is, you can only /win/ one given Nest a limited number of times every week. You can fail as many times as you want, but the great majority of items from Nests are only acquired after a successful clear.Sadly, despite its charms, some significant flaws mar Dragon Nest and detract largely from its otherwise polished gameplay:- As said before, character customization barely exists and development is largely one-way-only - there isn't as freeform choice in character build as there would be in a standard MMO like WoW or Everquest II. It's basically an online arcade game.- It is possible to miss content. This is usually something trivial such as a non-title achievement, but it will still drive completionists up the wall.- The game is entirely instance dungeon-based with little to no open world. The exploration fields don't have any combat in them, nor any content other than NPC's to talk to and gates into instance dungeons (similarly to Sonic Adventure.) This can make the game feel very railroaded and monotonous.- Costume items, which are largely cash-only and non-tradeable, also give you stats and perks. This means they're not costumes. They're cash-only equipment.- Titles also give you stats, but the majority of those are acquired ordinarily ingame and you may use a display title different from your stat title.- As with most if not all other free games that have equipment upgrades available, Dragon Nest's equipment upgrade rate is abysmal without paying cash to improve it and/or protect items from destruction. These items thankfully can be traded, but as cash items they will cost a small fortune.- Holiday events, and events in general, almost never give anything permanent and unique. They give consumables and temporary costumes at best, or items that can be obtained in normal gameplay. They're generally quite underwhelming and unrewarding.- The keyboard control scheme is VERY awkward and can't be remapped.- If you like endowed girls at all you won't be able to play as Kali, because she's constant softcore pornography on the screen and very distracting. She's the only character with jiggle (Archer / Sorceress / Tinkerer are all B-cup or less whereas she's at least a D-cup with a huge butt) and her dance animations border on profane. This is especially jarring given her dialogue is written as though she is very sweet and innocent.Despite these flaws, the game is colorful and fun with only a couple friends. You can form guilds, but only four-odd of you can run a dungeon at once anyway, so you don't need to bring a legion.And Tinkerer is SUPER CUTE. Give it a shot and see if you like it.			"

												I was looking for a new MMO that had fun and challenging PvP and most of all, a story to really IMMERSE myself in. That is what gets me hooked on a game. I made the awful mistake of summing up this MMO with many J/KRPGs out there. I think most of these have very cliched story lines or have poorly written scripts. But Dragon Nest is not the case. If you're a fan of reading quests and PVP, this is definitely a game to try.The story begins differently for each and every class you choose. Granted, they fit into the typical anime character archtypes, the boy who never gives up, the mysterious and talented but silent hero. However, their stories are interwoven in such a way that the characters interact somewhat differently with the NPC dialogues, making it interesting for different perspectives on the main story quest line.As for the state of the game, the devs and GMs seem to pay attention and have interest in retaining their population as well. Spontaneous events occur that you simply click on and teleport to an instance for all sorts of strange games, some familiar and fun with great rewards at the end. The community seems to be tight knit, and the servers swell every time a new content pack is released, and then over the course of two months, dwindles back to a steady population. This is common and expected for most ""themepark"" type MMOs such as WoW as opposed to ""sandbox"" types like EVE online.The gameplay is very fluid, and each class has a large array of flashy skills that make watching their animations very enjoyable every single time. Learning combinations and stacking them is highly addicting. The only thing that feels a bit weird is jumping, there is a very slight pause before taking off from the ground, but this is probably intended this way for fairness in PVP. In a game like Dragon Nest, bunny hopping could be an issue especially with melee classes. MODS! There are mods for this game from intricate skins to voice packs. In most youtube videos, you often hear the characters in the Korean / Japanese voice overs. Admittedly, I installed a Japanese voice pack and mixed it up with Korean as well. I understand neither of the language. But the game sounds MUCH better. The dialogue and the quests are completely in English. Even the cutscenes will not be a problem as they are completely captioned. It gives a more arcade feel to the game.Overall, Dragon Nest is a game that is definitely worth playing and worth recommending. Given Nexons track record on their game development, I feel that Dragon Nest is one of their better games and I hope the community grows and Nexon continues to support Dragon Nest. With its addition to steam, a steady influx of new players decide to give this game a try. It's very newb friendly if this is a beginning MMO for you, and free to play. Give Dragon Nest a shot!			"

												Any good in Dragon Nest is thoroughly ruined by it being a Nexon game, as usual.  The combo-based action combat is promising, but it quickly becomes the typical Nexon grind that pushes you toward overpriced microtransactions before you realize the game is actually just a husk with but a handful of repetitive content.

												   Finding a random party can be kinda hard so it is recommended to play with friends. However with different starting points for every class trying to play as different classes with your friends can become an issue but you will find yourself back with your buddy in a while.     The classes are genderlocked so if you want to play as a archer or a magic caster you will have to play as a girl or if you want to play as the cleric or sword-wielder you will have to play as a guy. (Most people including myself don't see this as a huge issue but is worth mentioning.) Classes do have multiple paths depending on your playstyle.    So far the levels/dungeons feel easy even on the highest difficulty with little penalty for dieing. (however I haven't played in a while so I could be wrong or updates could have changed things.)    Despite these flaws the game is fun and is worth trying with your buddies ( It's free it's not as if you're going to lose anything besides sleep trying it out.) "

												It shatters my heart to write a negative review for Dragon Nest. I only have 60.4 hours on steam but I played Dragon Nest before it was on Steam for 1000+ hours. When I started playing, the level cap was 40 and there was only 4 classes. I was never particulary ""good"" at the game as I only made it to level cap once when the cap was 40. However, 3-4 years ago, this game was just a ♥♥♥♥ing blast. You could play on Abyss difficulty which made the endless grind feel more like a challenging but rewarding adventure. I was never a succesful player but I remember getting so excited over new gear I saved up for a long time by getting Goddess Tear Drops. But now with the level 93 cap, this game is just dead. The added classes are honestly incredible and really diversifies gameplay. The problem is the 1-93 grind is so painfully boring due to limitations on what difficulty you can play. If that wasn't enough, you'll have a hard time trying to find people to play with. It's really a shame because when the game was active, the mentor system worked so well in trying to help your friends get to your rank and really gave an incentive for playing with other people of all ranks. The Goddess Tear Drops and mentor system all still exist which is great. It's just the fundamental aspects of an MMO are compltely and utterly GONE. The market is dead. I mention this because the marketplace used to be PACKED by dozens of people on every server when this game was alive and well. The combat, which is so incredible it kept this game alive far past the time it probably should have actually died; has been made more boring as dungeons have suddenly gotten ridicously easy. I am begging, and I mean BEGGING for Dragon Nest to be shut down in favor of a Dragon Nest 2 with updated graphics, balances, a sensible level cap between 40-93, and less pay-to-win schemes. The arcade-like feel of Dragon Nest makes it unique compared to other MMOs even after so many years that have seen bold competitors enter the MMO market. If they brought Dragon Nest to the next generation with a second installment, everyday gamers would fall head over heals for it. But for now, please don't support the current version.			"

												It hits a certain nostalgic note that made Ragnarok, Legend of Mana, and other past RPG's I've played enjoyable; then adds something special with some Vindictus tied in. It's nothing that will have me playing for days on end due to addiction like I've had in other games, but this game has a lot of charm and makes me feel warm and fuzzy when I play it! It's an awesome casual MMO experience that I highly recommend to anyone looking to try out something different from what they've played before.

												Edit: It seems the developers of this game have really sped up the update pace, which is good and slightly alleviates some of the issues.While it's combat is great and it sure did have a lot of potential as a game and is even actually enjoyable when things are fresh, it's not something I'd recommend playing in the long run if you're looking for something to invest a decent amount of time into. This is due to quite a few reasons, the combat is great and there was/is potential but the game has fell short in literally anything that isn't combat since release and continues to do so with no signs and a incredibly small chance of ever being fixed.Lets start off with a few issues-Lag is common-PvP is not balanced and never will be most likely-PvE is not balanced and never will be most likely-New classes always eclipse previous ones and are overpowered in one way or another in order to promote new characters and purchases of costumes and other things for these new characters (A trend common in F2P titles). The community also supports this (Goes along with it IE: Bandwagonning,etc) and will not allow you to join parties if you're playing a class that isn't as good as some of the others sometimes.-RNG is HUGE in this game and very good at screwing you over with it (Probably in part to get you to pay for items you need to safely enhance gear instead of investing large amounts of time in getting gold just to try again)-Sub classes of each main class usually change from which one is best to again, promote buying class change scrolls and what not for money.-The graphics are worse than something from 2005 and the game is not optimized at all or something is totally broken. Even with current hardware don't expect 60 fps, it's always been like this.-A lot of the really nice purchasable things like mounts, wings, weapon skins and other things are only obtainable by dragon eggs. It's like a gachapon/lottery with a really small chance to get the items that are actually worth anything, usually you just get junk. Eggs aren't cheap either, $1.50 per single Egg and $30 for a 30 pack. You might not even get one of the good things you hoped for by spending that much either, there's people who pay hundreds to get certain items.Now none of this is the main issue with this game nor are these all the issues. I'd say the main problem with this game is the roots of it, the way the game is designed. The game is instanced based with town world hubs. You have dungeons with monsters and a boss at the end and nests/raids which you can do a certain amount of times a week. -Dungeons are useful for leveling up till cap. -Nests are useful for getting drops towards crafting gear and other things. -Raids are for end game gear, there's also a hardcore version. -Dailies can be done once you reach cap, dailies consist of doing the current cap dungeons in order to get certain items that are useful. So here's the deal, level caps come with 1) Filler content (Constant class rebalancing and fixes that never actually fix anything and just shift power for money) 2) A new set of dungeons3) New nests and raid for each cap4) A new classYou'll get one good update every 1~3months with others being nothing special (Subject to change of course, I no longer keep up with the update pace/quality as of recently)So.. here we go, you put so much effort and time into content which is not fun for more than a week at most in order to be able to be strong enough to enjoy the new good content that comes out every 1~3months. This content is usually fun for a week at most (Excluding raids which take more time to master/beat through typically). You do dailies every single day (if you can stand doing them), nests every week (that are boring once you've learned them which takes about a week because it's literally doing the same thing every time you do them over and over which goes for any content released in this game) and the same applies to raids after a bit too. You also grind dungeons for drops, maybe grind some other various things the game has for gold and that's.. it. The game itself is fun, the combat is good and all that but all you're doing in the game is the same thing over and over and over every day in order to gear up which takes time just so you can enjoy and participate in the end game raids. There's nothing else to do, it's all instance based and not open world so you're doing this or afking.. It's just.. a shame, it's not worth your time. You'll have fun at first but by the end of it the boring, repetitive, and chore like content you need to do to get strong every day and week heavily outweighs the fun you'll have with new fresh content. Again, this is only the main flaw and only a flaw to those who aren't playing the game casually, there's a million other problems to this game stacked on top of it that I haven't mentioned aside from how static it is. There's better stuff out there to enjoy and Black Desert is coming too which has potential. If you're looking to play a game and enjoy/invest your time in it and have fun (The reason most people play games in general), this isn't for you. It's a great game to casually play though as the combat really is just that good.~Person who's played this game since close to the initial release			"

												It truly breaks my heart giving this game a negative review. This game used to be my most favorite MMORPG, simply from its action-oriented and non-targetting combat style, w/ its good community (from what I saw). Don't be misjudged by my hours of playtime, I had to run it on Nexon as for some reason the steam version never worked for me.So, what's so bad about it now?For starters, the playerbase is basically dead. I predict a few more months or maybe some years, and the game will be completely dried out of players. If you're new, wanting to play, you most likely won't come across anyone who will play w/ you as most are just lvl 90+, and have no interest in doing such little tasks for a person who will inevitably get bored and leave. That brings me to my next point: The level cap. Before, the level cap was 60-70, a good level cap for this game in my opinion. However, apparently from the time I was on hiatus until recently, they've changed the cap to 93 (I think)So, instead of fun dungeon-crawling with random people or guild-mates, you're stuck basically grinding alone in a dead server to reach 93 and get some actual good stuff.3-4 years ago, this game WAS MY LIFE. I would NOT stop gawking about it to friends, trying to get them to play, then them join and have a blast w/ me. Now?Now it's a dead place with hardly any chat in global andno one to dungeon crawl with (which, people to hang out with was one of the best parts, and grinding to such a level on your own would eventually wear you out). Just that, is enough to pull me away from this. Now something for all those verteran players like me, that kinda set us off. Apparently, around september 2016 and before, you could switch your account to EYEDenity (Nexon had control over DN first, then it was switched to Eyedenity). HOWEVER, if you didn't transfer it between that deadline, all your content was erased. Yep. MEANING, If you have a lvl 70 character, with some REALLY good gear, and you payed REAL LIFE Money on the game, that was all for nothing, as it was erased on the transfer. Granted, I never spent a dime on it, but it aggitated me, trying to use my Nexon account, finding out it wont work, and having that ONE Character I spent hours upon hours to get to lvl 50 with a single friend, which the file had a lot of memories for me. It's a sad tale, a wonderful game turned into.... this. Sorry to say, but I can't recommend it :(.			"

												I love this game. One of the first to implement a dynamic combat system into an mmorpg. This feature is incredibly fun and requres skill to aim at your enemies in order to use spells and such. Classes are gender-locked and are somewhat generic. Some translations are a little bit off as well. If you can overlook these cons, you get an incredibly fun game to play. I recommend playing around in a guild so you can play in nests on later levels so you can get optimal gear and money. 9/10			"

												(Written from perspective of a level 15 warrior)Easy to get into, simple and intuitive controls are good for playability but the technique is more than just ""mash buttons until everything's dead,"" although that is my play style as a solo warrior... Definitely more fun than WoW so far, although I have yet to see how the late game is.Art style is nice, I enjoy the overdone attack effects and the silly-but-still-dangerous low-level enemies.It seems a little on the easy side, I can solo dungeons on hard with little difficulty (adrenaline is another matter, however) but I can see where parties will be helpful, especially for non-warriors. Gobarta is no sweat, I can tank through it pretty easily but there's still that level of difficulty I like.Overall, a cool little game that's totally worth the low, low price of $0.00.			"

												I would probably recommend this game without a second thought 3-4 years ago back when it was 60-70 lvl cap not today though. Before looking at my 33hours on record and thinking i didn't play the game enough i probably have around 2K hours on the SEA server so trust me i played more then enough of this game and i can say without doubt the game is just dead at this point. They bsaically reworked the entire game to where only late game matters after you reach max level and by the time this review is posted max level is 93 so around lvl1 to 93 is just a grind fest and with the game being already pretty much dead most likely its going to be a solo grind then with actual players. Getting partys for raids and such is so hard if your new basically if your new and looking for a mmo game dont bother with this its not new user friendly at all you will feel you are playing a solo game until you reach max level and get good gear. 3 years ago : HELL YEAH PLAY THIS GAME so much fun doing nests ( 4 man really hard dungeouns ) and dragon nests ( 8man raid ) just do main quests / side quests or grind up with party members today : solo grind to 93. find a way to obtain good gear somehow. try to find a party or guild to do raids with ( too much hassle and pain not worth it anymore )			"

												I love this game. I've loved it since beta, it is the bar for F2P games. I played all of my characters to max level, and never had to pay to win, just buy fancy outfits, and mounts. However, there's a way to get that kind of stuff without paying. This game is on my top 3 list of games. Since I've leveled every base class to 80, I can say that it starts off kind of slow, but there are lots of helpful players who will grind you through the lucrative missions, and solo nest for you. You just have to ask, and this game will be rewarding, fun, and versitile. The PvP is also top notch, though a little unbalanced, but it can still be fun. Oh, and read the story, it's actually a good one. Enjoy.			"

												So, I've hit 200 hours in Dragon Nest, and I've compiled some information for everyone who may be wondering, ""Is it worth playing?""In short, YES.Here's a Pros-Cons List.Pros:-Extremely fun, fluid, face-paced, intense action combat-NOT pay-2-win AT ALL. Especially compared to other games in this genre.-PvP is REALLY fun too-SO many classes to choose from. All are unique-Leveling up characters isn't horrible-Good community-In-game economy is pretty good, compared to other MMOs-You can cosmetically and audio mod it a little bit to your liking (with help from Google that is, I won't tell you how here.)-Game has been going long and strong since lvl 40 cap, now at 93 cap-Nexon hasn't ruined it don't worry. -New publisher seems very nice, although they have that Engrish.-You earn a +50% EXP bonus to every character on the account (Up to 250%) for each character you have at max level.-You won't need to pay for character expansions (You get 25 character slots)-You won't need to pay for inventory expansions (You get 4/5 30-slot bags to carry all your stuff)-Events for free pets (which pick up items) are every holiday.-Cash shop items can be earned for free, because of events.- +200% EXP Scrolls that last for 7 days can be purchased for $2.50 and will easily get you to max level if you grind moderately (3-4 hours a day) for a few (4-7) days.Cons:-Leveling can be tedious sometimes (running the same dungeon 20 times to get one level, UNLESS you have capped characters.)-If you don't have any gold in the beginning, it's hard to earn it right off the bat (only for your first character though)-Slight learning curve for those unfamiliar with games of this type-Cash shop armor is incredibly expensive, $28 for one permanent set for one character (although at max level it won't be hard to earn the gold to buy from other players)-Cash shop armor has some unfair stats. For example: One weapon gives +800 Phys. and Magic Damage, but at the max level that's hardly notable. (but, it's all earnable from playing the game and buying it from other players)-Cash shop gacha is expensive, and gives some really good items, still not pay to win though.Summary:Yes, it's worth playing. I recommend it. You can play and be a good player without paying. Convenience for leveling can be speeded up with cash shop items, and some cash armors give considerable stat boosts, but nothing so unfair that you will want to quit the game.			"

												The game looks great, I've heard nothing but good things about it... Problem is it installs a rootkit-style service that keeps you from closing the process using ... Anything (Even taskkill /f as admin), outside of the game itself.This game monitors your processes using 'Ahnlab Hackshield Pro'. If you're okay with that, then by all means play it - it looks great. But for those of you who don't like the idea of a company installing a rootkit on your system that keeps you from closing processes and monitoring what you're doing, stay away.			"

												Now, the veterans can defend this game all they like, but I started playing the game around the day that the infamous level 90 patch came out so let me release a review from the viewpoint of a new play who has reach level 75 and stopped playing due to immense boredomPros>Combat System-The combat system is the only thing that this game has going for it, you can pull intricate strings of combos and abilities>Classes-Each class is unique and awesome, I love how they all lookCons>EVERYTHING ELSE!-Let me elaborate>Any dungeons below level 90 are SUPER MEGA ULTRA..... easy-Apparently, these dungeons USED to be difficult, but they decided to completely F***ING remove the hardest difficulties for all low level dungeons. The nests are easy when they used to require a party, (I MEAN FOR GOD'S SAKE, YOU'RE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO PARTY FOR THE FIRST NEST) you take no damage while the enemies all die in one hit, and you can't even stumble over to higher level dungeons if you want a challenge because it's barred by a level cap, and by the time you reach the recommended level for the dungeon, it'll be too easy. I was waiting for the game to get difficult FOR 75 LEVELS. I WAS ONE SHOTTING EVERY ENEMY AND BOSS IN EVERY DUNGEON FOR 75 LEVELS! At that point, if the game can provide zero excitement for what was essentially 70% of the game, then it's not good game design. And I'm patient, oh I'm very patient, I'm always willing to give a game a chance, but this game could not impress me, it took too long.>Story missions progress way too slowly-I won't talk too much for this one. Basically, once you reach level 60, the dungeons that you have to traverse through for the story will have a recommended level of 45. Not to mention, really intimidating monsters appear in the story cutscenes a lot, and you end up getting excited at the fact that you'll be able to finally get a challenge, only to have your  character get stomped on in the cutscene and have the bad guy run off with the important McGuffin that you were sent to chase after and you instead have to fight some insignificant boss, that just basically ends up becoming a miniboss in later dungeons. But hey, at least there's occasional voice acting and almost every character has a unique personality why you can then elborate on through giving them gifts, but that's only fun if you're actually interested in this game's story.>PvP is ""Balanced""-Unless you're playing with friends who are around the same level as you, you're essentially not allowed to PvP until you're level 90. Oh, don't worry though, there's and equalizer put into play so that your stats are basically increased to what they would be around level 90. The problem is that your skills still do garbage damage against players who have more points put into their skill trees, have better armor, and have learned their combos while you have nothing to protect yourself with.. The equalizer just makes killing you take like 30 more seconds than it should.Don't play this game unless you have a time machine. I've heard countless good things about the game before the update, all things that I wish I could've been a part of, but from what I can guess, the developers wanted to make it easier to reach level 90 to appeal to players who want have level 90 characters for all the classes, and for some reason they decided to remove content that didn't need to be removed in the first place.

												TL;DR It's a solid title- worth a look, for sure. ^.^I played a little of Dragon Nest waaaay back when (maybe a little of the beta?), and put in maybe ~20 hours or so before I downloaded this on Steam.Anyhoo- from a gameplay perspective, Dragon Nest resembles Vindictus. You choose a (gender-locked) class, run around a shared town hub and accept quests, then delve into instanced dungeons, slay monsters to transition between areas, and face a boss in the final room.I'll get a bit more specific...GAMEPLAY- As outlined above.You do learn new skills fairly quickly, which are infinitely more entertaining to use than your basic attack combos. There's a level up reward chest you can open every time you level up, as seen in several f2p titles. Dragon Nest has... taken an interesting approach with their iteration; at level 6, you are granted a costume set that- when equipped- grants your character hp and damage far beyond normal means. It will essentially trivialize most content you come across, and is on a 7-day timer. A second identical set is granted at another level, but I forget what it was, exactly...That being said, it's a lovely little feature if you've played before and want to barrel through story and get into the meatier content. I'm not sure if such a system would be detrimental to a new player's experience- if a time comes when the items expire and that overwhelming power is lost, it may be a bit of a shock having to suddenly rely on player skill and skill synergies... although to be fair, joining parties/guild may help alleviate that issue... I can't assert anything on that issue quite yet.GRPAHICS- Cute, albeit simplistic aesthetic.Most things (the older assets for sure) are noticeably low-poly, but it looks like a lot of love went into the textures. The effects on most skills are bright and flashy, and could end up obscuring gameplay in larger groups. But solo, I've had no problem keeping up with things.Once again comparing this to Vindictus, Dragon Nest is considerably more gentle on my computer's aged hardware. I honestly think a laptop less than 5 years old could handle this pretty well.STORY- It actually has one, and it's pretty good.The story arc you experience differs to some degree between each class. Sometimes a lot, sometimes a little. Dialogue is generally pretty funny and light, but there are heavier plot points here and there. Characters are a little... melodramatic, perhaps. But I find I like more characters than I find annoying... so that's nice.AUDIO/SOUND/MUSIC- Nothing really stands out, but nothing's downright terrible... not even the voice-acting.Sound effects are loud and bombastic. Music is decent, but the loops are relatively short and can overstay their welcome before too long, so I've disabled it. My biggest complaint is that ambient sounds are directly tied to music, so with that muted, towns and forests sound dead... but still- just queue up your own playlist or internet radio or podcast or whatever. :PCOMMUNITY- Haven't had a lot of dealings with people yet, but things don't seem particularly toxic, at any rate.There's one server, broken up into channels. I've made a point to select low-pop channels just to avoid crowds, but global chat has stayed relatively quiet. I have no idea if there are just that few people playing, or if more conversations are simply being held in party/guild chat... I certainly hope Dragon Nest isn't ""dying"", as I do find it rather enjoyable.CASH SHOP- Doesn't appear to be buy-to-win..?Basic cosmetics (costumes, and a few exclusive faces and hairstyles for most classes), crafting boosters and whatnot. I have yet to purchase anything, and don't feel like I really have to. I call that a win.EXTRA- Just some little tidbits I didn't work into the fields above.-There's a mercenary system that lets any class bring a ""combat pet"" of sorts into dungeons. It IS stuck behind a few walls; beyond the three starter mercs (which you will be able to choose one upon completing a lvl24 quest), the rare and epic varieties have to either be grinded for, or bought off of the player marketplace. Some of the available mercanaries are npc's from certain class' storylines, so even if you don't really NEED a mercanary, it can be entertaining to battle along side them, and see them toss out a one-liner once a dungeon is cleared... could become more necessary once those super-costume items expire, and you aren't running with a party/guild.-There's PvP available as early as lvl10, but it's something I've not touched, nor really plan to... like other games, there is a PvP based currency and a variety of items to be bought.-MOST classes, with the exception of the Lancea, Machina, and two elite classes, will recieve a specialization quest at lvl15, and can subsequently choose one of two secondary classes. This choice grants a second skill tree to develop and populate your hotbar with. The skills from this second tree generally require a certain weapon type be wielded, so bear that in mind when the time comes. For the classes with no specialization choice, your second skill tree simply unlocks when you reach lvl15.-Building on that, your choice of weapon type affects your basic attacks/combos. You'll begin with a starter weapon of each type, so try them out early on and get a feel for them. ^.^Think that's it... again, I've yet to experience the full gamut of what Dragon Nest has to offer, so please correct me if I'm wrong about something. o3o			"

												I figure i've played long enough at this point to write a review.To begin, the combat in this game is really satisfying. You cannot expect to faceroll everything and walk away with your life, you need to pay attention to enemy attacks and dodge accordingly. Especially in Nests (boss raids) as you cannot use health potions (though support classes do exist, and they have party heals)  inside Nests, so being careful and dodging properly is especially important.There are many different classes, each with their own unique playstyle. Whether you want to play a close range Archer who specializes in kicks and hurricane attacks, an Ice Witch who flings off a relentless barrage of ice spells and turns everything into ice cubes, or maybe you feel like playing a Stank-a** Cleric who drops totems on the field and explodes them or some s***. You get the point, there's a ton of different classes.Best of all? No more Nexon.  If you're a fan of Fast-Paced Action-RPGs with Giant Dragons and s***, try the game. You won't regret it.			"

												Spent a lot of hours playing this with my girlfriend, been too long since I last played but I highly suggest. Great game, lot of fun played with a party, less fun playing alone but still a good experience for anyone who likes RPG games. The combat is probably my favourite thing about the game, real-time action and a lot of moving around and dodging. The graphics are still really good and can run on older computers with no problem. The only critique I can make, as well as being an aspect that I really like and something unique about the game is the session-based arenas in which all combat takes place. On one hand I quite like having them in sessions and having a set objective and path each time, but it becomes repititive if you have to complete several quests over some levels in the exact same area. I do, however, enjoy having to master each location and looking at different ways on dealing with the mobs/bosses. Overall, if I ever get the time/companions to play this game again, I totally would. 10/10 fun.			"

												If you want to get into a free to play mmo, this is the one to play. It has the action combat and storyline of a single player rpg, with the social mechanics of an mmo. EDIT: don't let my game time throw you off, I played this game a bunch before it came to steam.Pros:-Great combat-Unique graphics/art style-Fun NPC dialogue with some good voice acting-Challenging bosses with selectable difficulties (which offer better rewards when completed at the higher difficulties)-Good Variety of classes-decent party/guild/social system-nice soundtrack-interesting, followable story line-plent yof sidequests and events-satisfying character progression-Not pay to win! Cash shop weapons/armor generally do not provide stats, only cosmetics-semi-complex crafting systemCons:-Can be a little grindy in certain level gaps (eg 18-24)-Gender locks on classes-not a huge variety when it comes to character custimization without paying for cash shop items-not open world (I prefer open-world mmos, but that is just my opinion. this game would have a lot of potential issues if it was open world)			"

PWR Leveling & Useful Information (93 Cap) 
A Guide for Dragon Nest
By: AuroraRose

			Tips, tricks, and useful information!		


PROS- Fast combat- Fun anime style- Seasonal events are great- Nesting is a lot of fun- Nice community (For the most part people are willing to help you out and show you the ropes of the game)CONS- Leveling up is a pain (Repetitive)- Pay to win slightly (You can still play the game and have fun and have great gear; but it does not make it entirely free to play)			"

												The Good:-The best combat system of any RPG I've ever played. The system involves having an abundance of awesome skills at your disposal and several fighting game mechanics. The system is perfect for creating a ton of different combos that flow together very nicely.-Leveling up is always rewarding. Not only will you see very noticable differences in your performance with new gear, new skills are unlocked frequently.-While the class selection may appear small at first, each class branches out into 2 paths twice. So with the current 6 classes available, that's really like having 24 classes.-Each class feels unique. This includes the classes that are made from branching out. Lunar Knights and Gladiators may both be Swordsmen, but the only similarity between the two will be a couple of basic skills and their character model.-PVP has a great amount of variety. You can join a 1 on 1 lobby to fully experience the fighting game mechanics, you can participate in hectic 16-player team deathmatches, free-for-alls, and ""kill the other team's leader"" matches, or you can play the ghouls mode, which is a standard zombie mode that functions well as a completely level-free form of PVP.-Higher-level PVE and PVP demand a high amount of skill from players.-Leveling up is mostly painless. There will be patches of grinding you'll do here and there, but the grinding in this game is much less repetitive than in other RPGs.-Every skill you are given has a purpose. There are very few skills that become obsolete.-Tons of stat builds to choose from.-The voice-acting is full of personality when it's there. Voice-acting is most prevalent during combat, with many skills making the character using them say something. Important NPCs also have voice-acted greeting and farewell lines.-The main story is solid and easy to follow, even if you're like me and skip through most of the dialogue. It will also provide cinematics to spice things up from time-to-time.-If you put in the time to read it, the dialogue for main and side quests is well-written and genuinely funny.-Locations are very diverse and well-designed.-A unique art direction that combines cute with badass perfectly.-It's easy to find parties at peak player activity times.-Tons of seasonal and update events with useful rewards.-A solid guild system with features such as custom guild emblems, guild storage, and guild buffs.The Bad:-The format of the world. While it's perfectly functional, it's a huge shame that this game isn't an open world. The only time you'll ever feel like you're in a populated world is when you're in a main town. As soon as you leave one, the only players you'll have any physical contact with is whoever is in your party, which only includes up to 3 other players at a time. There will be a few NPCs out in the non-main town areas, but they don't help the feeling of loneliness very much.-All PVE gameplay is instance-based, and the instances, while being highly detailed and just right in length, are usually a linear path. Sometimes quests will give you additional objectives besides getting to the end of an instance, but that only happens rarely.-Minimal character customization to start out with.-You'll have to ask around for info on the game's deeper mechanics such as paralyze, super armor, and knockdown.-Skills are not always described nearly well enough. Skill descriptions never provide information like how many invincibility frames a skill has, how strong it's ability to break super armor is, etc.-Armor sets that you don't buy with real money only have one appearence per rarity. For example, a common and a rare set of armor will look different, but a level 20 set of rare armor will look exactly the same as a level 50 set of rare armor. This happens in a few cases with weapons too, but not usually. Curiously, headgear is a part of all gear sets, but will never be visible on characters unless it's one of the epic-rarity headgears (which do actually have differing appearances compared to other epic headgears).-Server instability can be an issue at times.-The things that cost real money are terribly over-priced. A full set of cool-looking armor that gives some extra stat bonuses costs about $20, though you can reduce the price a bit if you're willing to ""rent"" the armor for a limited time instead. Having played Nexon games that use this format of over-priced microtransactions since 2005, I have never bought a single thing from these shops and have enjoyed the games anyway. As a side note, you can earn NX (the currency used for these microtransactions) for free, but the means of doing this often involve a LOT of personal information sharing to a LOT of shady websites. If you try to use fake personal information, you'll end up like me and get permanently banned from the service.(Overall, the cons aren't very significant, so just give this game a try)			"

												[SRS][Respect the tag]TL;DR Cliffs:Review from a veteran of DN (back in 60 cap). I've also played a LOT of MMORPGs like WoW, Flyff, Raganarok Online, RS, MS, and more.Pros:Best combat system I've seen out of 11 MMORPGSkill-based gameplayDress-up Simulator 2017Skills are huge. Mounts are huger. Bosses are hugest.Game mechanics promote cooperative play.Fun communityGood storyline33 classes with wildly different playstyles.Balanced classesCons:Content is at level cap, grinding is mind-numbingly easy.LOL Economy. 6g a quest, 3k for a L-Grade enhancement ATTEMPT.RNG. It's depressing.Almost no character customization.PS2-era graphics.8/10, would return from hiatus again.Full ReviewThe game's changed a lot since I last played it. With every patch the power creep gets a little stronger. However, the instanced dungeons also get harder as well. For instance, this last patch added in a new class, the Arch Heretic, and updated our daily quest dungeons. We went from having bosses with maybe 20m hp to bosses wih about 200m.Updates:Game Devs keep the game regularly updated. The Devs are actually based out in Korea (known as kDN) and NA gets their updates a couple of months later. Luckily, this generally means that we get our updates prebalanced. Most recently, this meant our Tinkerer Awakening for the Adept class wasn't broken; we got it all in one patch. kDN, on the other hand, had the Adept class catapult to a top tier buffer, debuffer, and number 1 DPS before getting her rebalanced.Of course it's also bad thing, since ED's one of the worse publishers of DN and it takes about a month for new content to be translated. While I know they aren't the direct developers, having incomplete released content months after other publishers get it out.... it just strikes me as lazy. God knows I wouldn't play DN NA if it wasn't the only one available.The game is well balanced. Though it's hard to say sometimes since everyone hits OMGWTFBBQ damage at endgame. To place this in perspecive, you go through the storyline with up to 40k attack. Beginner cap equipment instantly puts you above 100k, not counting bonus multipliers from Elemental conversions and Awakened skills.Combat:The combat was amazing years ago and it's amazing now. In fact, I'd argue that it's even better now. While the game was more active back in 60 cap, the classes weren't balanced, with my capped Acrobats/Tempests being outdamaged by ungeared level 30 Sorceresses. Ouch. Now every class is about equal in terms of party benefit, with some being situationally better. This is a GREAT thing, since that means every class is accepted in public parties with the only criteria being your experience or gear.Moreover, the combat is really satisfying. The game, with its PS2 graphics, delivers some very impressive skills and combos, with large explosions of every color. Certain classes have really tight skill rotations and you have to keep up with managing them while dealing with Mechs.For instance, while fighting the first boss on Typhoon Krag Nest HC, you have to DPS the Gardener boss while killing any blue mushrooms counting down. While doing this, you have to stay away from any green mushrooms on the map if you're marked by the Orc Bomber. You have to dodge the Orc Bomber's attacks while keeping them from accidenally hitting the green mushrooms. If the blue mushroom counts down, or you accidentally hit the green mushroom cause the Gardener smacked you into them, the entire party takes a mapwide attack. You can tank these, but the harder Nests like have insta-kill mechanics that you MUST learn or you will kill your entire team.PvP:As for PvP, the combat is still really fun, fast, with intuitive and free-flowing combos. However, ladder rankings are unstable since so many new classes and awakenings are being added in. The meta changes before it's even developed. Yikes. The nice thing is that no one take PvP too seriously, and they won't rage just because they lost. PvP is completely skill based, and the developers have their own section just for PvP balancing.Even better, to help deal with power creep, every skill is rebalanced in PvP. A debuff that would normally last 30s becomes 10s, a. In a sense, PvP is another game entirely and one that I highly recommend getting into. WARNING: This game has one of the highest learning curves I've ever seen for PvP. You will lose and you will lose very badly until you learn all of the classes, combos, and i-frames.Player Friendly?The community is pretty solid. There are a few toxic people, but the game itself rewards cooperative play. You literally get more drops at the end of dungeons, use less Empowerment, and get team-revives just from having more people playing with you. Guilds are super nice and easy to get into, and they're always down to teach new and returning players.This last update updated a ""Growth Guide"" which gives new players a full set of Theano gear and Weapons. Generally, new players would have to spend a few weeks building up a set; now you're given one and can proceed to more endgame stuff without being straight carried.However, the economy is in shambles. Remember how I said ED takes what kDN developers update and release it here? Yup, they did that again. However, they never updated gold costs while simultaneously lowering gold acqusition to the lowest of the servers. The real killer is enhancement costs, which are necessary to tackle harder content.To put this into perspective, you get about 6g per end-game quest. (1g for ""talking"" quests). It costs a few hundred gold to CRAFT legendary equipment. It costs thousands to attempt to enhance it to an appropriate level (at like 10% enhancement rate...) let alone silly equipment like crests that add Final Damage for 40k+.It's gotten to the point where players SELL dungeon runs because it's faster and cheaper for normal people to pay geared people to bring them than to attempt to get geared themselves first. To put this into perspective again, one IDN HC run (you need at least 2 runs for a shoe) costs 3.5k gold.Now for the ugliest part; RNG and P2W. This game is slightly P2W, with extensive OP set bonuses for completing costume sets with accessories that can only be found in dragon eggs. Costume sets are $30, and dragon eggs are $1.50. These dragon egg items cannot be traded or shared, even with your own characters. Once RNG blesses you with a piece, you better pray that it's on a class you won't mind maining for a while.This newest Cold Mirage/Sadnyth set is notorious, with players reporting less than 0.2% drop rates for Sadnyth Tails. If you really want that tail, it'll most likely take you over $600 to get. Good luck. ED gives off 50 cents worth of points every day you log in though, so that helps a little.Misc:The classes are also gender locked. I didn't like it at first, but now I appreciate it, since it literally makes you the character in the DN storyline.There's a severe lack of customization. There's no points to upgrade Strength or Dexterity like traditional games. Your stats are based solely off of your equipment. You have little flexibility in what skills you get with Awakened skills requiring max level skills.You get like 4 hair colors to choose from. Any more and it's RNG or $.Note: To most of these negative reviews are people who lost their account when the game flipped publishers; You guys had over two months to switch. I lost my account too but I don't spend all day whining about it. Play or not, you can't say it's a bad game just because you didn't keep up with your updates. Please stop being the cancer in the gaming community who rate negatively just cause of one failed patch or ragequit.			"

												This game is great, I've got more than enough game time to prove that. The classes proved a refreshing twist on MMORPGs that many others fail to achieve. The combat is exciting and stylish on every class in both PvE and PvP even with unbalancing on classes. The story line is pretty interesting, if you decide to even pay attention to it. However this game is not without its fair share of flaws. I'll make a small list to explain some of the more pressing problems1. This IS a Nexon game, which if you know from their other games they treat the Chinese version of the game MUCH better.2. Stamina system, again another Nexon thing. Once you hit the (current) cap the game drains you stamina (called PWR here) in as little as two or three dungeon runs3. Juggling dominates PvP. You can find rooms that let you burn your PWR for medals known as ""chill"" rooms so it is not as big of a problem as the two aboveThis game is worth playing. However expect to be treated like crap by the customer support and just Nexon all together. It offers a great experience to both new and old MMORPG players.			"

												Great Game when it came out, now not so much. It was innovative and kind of first of its kind. The only problem I have with DN and the main reason I stopped playing it is- I felt lonely. DN is a race to the top kind of game. It wasn't like that in the beginning but slowly became that. Everyone is racing to the top/cap and then after a while you've got newbie towns that become an absolute desert, and you've got no one to do instances with. The only time those towns become populated again is when they release a new character. If you play this game with friends, then it'll be a fun game to play and I'd recommend it. However, if you're thinking about coming in by yourself, then I'd say don't bother. It'll be fun at first, but you'll eventually feel lonely and will stop playing. DN is also a highly competitive game. If you don't have a gaming mouse, don't even step into the arena.			"

												This is a MMORPG. The usual aspects are all there. The grinding, the level, the cosmetics, the cash grab. Apart from all that however, it is surprisingly fun. The dynamic combat system varies from class to class; no two classes play the same way. Skills trees are varied and unique, and is overall implements a pretty seamless fighting style. The graphic are mediocre at best, with rather outdated texutres and sometimes glitchy models, but is certainly acceptable. The game is poorly optimized for AMD GPUs be warned, it is very hard to run at smooth FPS's, and textures will sometimes not display properly.Overall very fun time killer, though some polishing would definetly help.

												Pros - - NO game beats Dragon Nest's combat system- Great PVP- A large amount of classes each having branced off sub-classes- Challenging- A game of skill, gear is just to get things done faster- Classes have their own unique use- Awakening skills- Ultimate skills- End game gear is worth getting- Nexon is gone- A story, not a great one, but there's a story- Has a movie- Not too dead- All your powers make you feel overpowered even if you're weak- A fair amount of helpful players- We're mostly all cancerCons - - Some classes are quite weaker than the other- Unless the gear is a costume or end game gear, it all looks the same- Costumes give a huge buff in stats (Can either be baught by a huge sum of gold or real life money)- Not open world- Cash shop is needed if you wanna get somewhere about 100x+ faster			"

												I would like to start off by saying that this is a wonderfully thought out game. I admire the movesets and fighting system. The graphics are nice and all.Now let me get to what I don't like:Hardly any character customization- There are 6 classes, 2 males 4 females. You can't change genders and you get a limited amount of custom bits.The game feels empty despite dungeons and quests-The lack of attack versatility beyond the few attacks makes it start to feel repetitively linear-I wish I could get myself to play this and like it for longer than whatever my play time is, but despite playing every character and trying all of their initial movesets and the secondary moveset of the warrior. Leaving me still saying: Empty.			"

												Dragon Nest is a game from Nexon, the evil minds behind Maple Story. This game plays very much like Vindictus with various tiers of difficulty in each mission area, different loot, different bosses/moves/hp imcreased, etc. The thing that separates this from Vindictus is the cuteness of it all. This is a very ""cute"" game where everything is nice and bright and the conversations you have with NPC's are downright funny quite often. You never know what they'll end up talking to you about before you accept a quest or are just improving relations with them.You can pick a few different classes but they are all gender locked. A fighter is male and a sorceress is female for example.This game is hard to describe if you haven't played Vindictus because that game has very similar ....everything! It's just a tad more.You can crafticular mission area and so on. It's worth trying this game just to see if you like it. I often sit down intending to do just one mission or two and end up playing for hours. Definitely the sign of a good game.			"

												This is easily the best MMO I have ever played. The combat in this game is the only 1 of its kind. Very fast paced and fluid. It feels and looks amazing when taking down huge groups of enemies in seconds. There will be almost 50 different job classes when the Assassin is released. Lots of different things to do besides just questing. Huge achievement system. The dialog is well written and humorous on most NPCs. Theres no reason not to play this when its a free game.Edit: Assassin is released!			"

												Cons:  -RNG on RNG gearing system makes gearing difficult and time consuming  -People who treat the game like a job neglect new players  -Your tickets will be answered within 1-5 years (Literally)  -Game has had past troubles balancing classes and gameplay  -Can get repetitive and requires much grinding  -Gender locked classes with limited customization  -Early game leveling ends up being mostly soloed and everything is end game based  -An often lack of communication in what the game wants: may be hard for new players to get used toPros:  -Brilliantly fun fast paced action combat system  -A rather kind community overall, with exceptions as always.  -Challenging skill based PvP  -A wide range of classes to choose from  -Fast paced leveling  -A very manga plot if you're into that  -Not Open world (It is instance based); which I like but can be a turn off for others  -Interesting mechanics that require the players to learn the battle's ins and outs  -Always something new to get excited about  -Easy to get sucked in for all eternityI'd like to say, for those salty over Mists of Peril the update wasn't a shock, really. I was actually grossly excited about T5 finally fixing all the issues: the class discrimination, the elemental party imbalances, and I even like the new UI after I finally got used to it. I will miss the old content, as some of it I never got the chance to enjoy, but what can anyone really do?T5 was a long overdue update and altogether I think T5 has improved the game,except RNG on RNG. But I don't think that'll ever get fixed.You can expect an action MMORPG, with a not quite as in-your-face 'give us money' campaign as compared to a lot of other free MMO's. If you hold vanity as a need you'll see a lot more difficulty on that front, as well as if you treat the game like a job and need the best of everything.You can do end game content with a little effort without putting money in, but some people will always have a stick up their bottom trying to be better than everyone else. The game will be work if you do that though.What makes me adore the game is and always has been the combat though. It is unlike anything I've had the pleasure to enjoy in other games.As a veteran player whose put over 100 hours into the steam version, and at least 300-500 hours prior to getting the game on steam, I recommend the game, with all its troubles.

												What got MY attention and hooked to this game:- The fast paced combat: Although each class has their respective roles, you can have the same fast paced fun with just about any of the classess to choose from. Which makes it super satisfying when you successfully create your own skill chain combos, and ends up either completely destroying groups of mobs in pve or players in pvp.- All the classes to choose from: Cleric was a blast for me as my first class, Warrior gave me a whole new meaning of power, Sorceress made me think twice when fighting against magic. I can honestly say the skill/abilities from each class are absolutely cool, creative, flashy, and work brilliantly well together in whatever order you want.- Things aside from pve/pvp: Oddly enough for me I found the fishing, cooking, and farming very fun. Cooking made me realize how useful the items can be in this game, wanting to explore and learn more recipes to test them in dungeons. Fishing can be surprisely difficult to do unless you autofish instead for a more relaxing time. Farming can be your secondary source of income of ingame cash.Sure there are cosmetics/costumes that give bonus stats, the grind is a living hell, pvp can be either really fun or just absoultely a broken gamemode for others. But the majority of the community is friendly and actively helping new players when they ask for it. The story is surprisingly interesting but abit lenghty, and for this type of art-style, the general scenery and structures you see both in a town or dungeon are stunning and give a hint of nostalgic feeling (at least for me)			"

I was afraid that the game was dead after seeing a lot of negative comments, but it is very much the opposite.  It will seem that way at first because almost everyone is towards the eng game now lol.  It's fine though, since leveling up is very easy in this game, and quick.			"

												While I have played this game for a long time, I've had my fun with it. The combo system is good, but rarely has any effects on actual gameplay other than PVP where literally you cannot win without better stats. This game isn't as Skill to Win as it used to be, according to most of my friends who have played it for a long time. Although this game has a pretty good base and whatnot, grinding on the same dungeons just becomes really boring. Do I recommend this game? Yes and no.The PVP system is a bit flawed, but I can see where it has its fun parts. The dungeon and EXP system itself are pretty good, looting system along with them. But I do not encourage buying stuff in this game with real money, since it's pretty much just a waste.The variety of classes in this game is also a good thing to mention. But some classes definitely rise up higher than others do, which really disappoints me.The story becomes really repetitive but the only entertaining parts are when you get to actually see the story of your own character. Other than that, it's just the main story of the game.As I said, I don't exactly recommend this game but I have solid hopes for it.			"

												I've played Dragon Nest for about three months now. I did my first actual transaction with them about a month ago. I wasn't a beginner by no means by that point but their transaction interface is well..for the lack of other words ""confusing"". Especially when you are purchasing via Steam it does NOT say if it's credits and/or what. ""charge nx"" okay so that doesn't tell me anything I'm sorry but it's true. ""buy nx"" that tells me it's some sort of game currency that's all it tells me. If you plan to BUY anything from Dragon Nest I would HIGHLY advise you to read their terms first. I will NEVER buy anything from them again. Their customer support has been....superiorly unfashionable to say the least. If you enjoy the game so be it, and they even recently came out with kali class on the American version! Game rating: 4/5Payment rating 0.00000001/5 "

Other than that, i think that over all the game is a fine peice. Great story, Great leveling, Amazing time spand, Amazing fighting mechanics, and over all just has the basis of an original MMORPG and a fiew extras. It has lower graphics than current triple A games but im fine with that. It helps frame rate and is not too much different than higher graphics. I would reccomend this!			"

												Dragon Nest is a fun game for those tired of tab-targetting games. It is fast paced and entertaining. I will list some of the pros and some of the cons to the game.Pros:-Cute chibi style animation-Unique classes and specializations-Live-action combat (yes you have to aim)-Good story-Supports different playstyles (pvp, pve elitists, and pve casuals)-Leveling is pretty easy-Decent ability to replay (reroll multiple characters)Cons:-Repetitive quests (you will have to do the same dungeon several times)-Not new player friendly (takes a lot of getting used to as far as crafting, build guides, rotations, and how to obtain gear)-Not very challenging until higher levels-Cosmetics (costumes, while visually appealing, give stats and you have to pay real money for them, I am cheap so no thank you)-Small community (good luck finding answers to your questions, most people just wing it)-The running animation is hilarious in the worst way for all classesWhen all is said and done it is a very fun game that is easy to get into but difficult to get into competitive content. I would label it more as a casual game. For a free to play game it is not pay to win, but it is pay to look better than everyone else and have a bit of an edge as far as stats if you buy costumes and pets. It may not be perfect but it is a great game to kick back with friends who are tired of playing other things. "

												1. 7 classes with dynamic, purely skilled based combat...HOWEVER many classes are nerfed to the point of uselessness, so join the bandwagon classes or enjoy playing alone. Parties seek specific classes/will not play with specific certain classes so do your research first. Unbalanced class system. This applies to both PVP and PVE, but mostly to PVE. PVP is awesome and absolutely skill based, with equipment not so much [they nerf equipment to balance the playing field a little, better equipment is still advantageous].2. Plenty of guilds/active player base... HOWEVER they're not the cream of the crop people, there are nice players but more than half the time you'll deal with immature ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that devote a bit too much time [and real life money, with microtransactions reaching several hundred dollars] on this game. That being said, if you're looking for VERY active people to regularly play with, this is the right game.3. Free to play entirely... HOWEVER the microtransactions does give VERY NICE boosts in-game. For example, end game you might have.. 800k HP. But with a $30 costume, you can have 900k HP without having to buy expensive gear. Costumes can also boost your movement speed [some classes are SLOW AS HELL], which is kind of nice. Some costumes are really cool, like robotic wings... or a dragon mount/pet... even fun things like a fluffy sheep.4. Unbelievable amounts of grinding, there's no way to avoid this. You can buy powerlevels, have fun with that. Grinding for max level then for decent gear, because the bosses hit HARD and unless your skills can avoid the bills, keep farming that gear. Also when partying with people they won't even play with you if you have bad gear... so YOU BETTER GRIND.5.  Speaking of #3 and #4, microtransactions can be used to.. avoid grinding for money a bit. You can buy items with real life money, and sell in game for gold.6. Noncombat skills available, just not purely combat oriented. HOWEVER ... 3 skills: cooking, fishing, farming. No one fishes/fishing is completely useless. Cooking is likewise the same and the ingredients for cooking are so weird/hard to obtain that it's not worth it [have to rely on RNG drop rates, not gathering]. Farms are overpacked/almost impossible to obtain farm spots unless you can acquire a few spots and obsessively watch over your spot so no one else takes it.7. Great story lines. "

												Okay, I'm just gonna start listing♥♥♥♥♥♥right off the bat here. -Pros.The combat is well executed, as to have reflex-based combat, instead of targeting, as do most other RPG's have that.Customization was okay, would have preferred there to be a bit more variety, armor wise, though. Excellent storyline, probably the best thing about this game. Animations for the skills are cool as hell to watch, as well as the skills themselves. Speaking of skills, very wide choice of skills, and specializations for your desired class. Graphics are brilliant, very well drawn, and simple. The way they should be. Isn't as pay to win as I thought it was gonna be.-Cons. REALLY, REAAALLLLYYY grind-esque experience, most of the game I was either grinding my character to the cap level, {which they are ALWAYS, changing.} Or, I'm paying others gold to boost me to those said higher levels. Game speed isn't always the best, as it likes to lag a LOT, It might just be me, though. Eh, who knows. Good variety of class choice, but they're genderlocked, so -1 for customization. The very buggy, and annoying ""HackShield"" always seems to♥♥♥♥♥♥its pants at random times, causing the game to crash, and me having to reinstall Dragon Nest. Multiple times, If I may add. Overall opinion?; Good combat, good graphics, good storyline. but♥♥♥♥♥♥everything else.			"

												Seriously. This game is good. It's got real action based combat. The moves are like over the top fighting game specials. They even have a combo system. There's no filler. Every move has a purpose and is fun to use. It has a feeling unlike any other MMO out there. The story, amazingly, is really top notch. The presentation is exceptional. Yeah, the player wipe sucked. I lost my character too. But, it's pretty easy to get back to max level and there are other really interesting classes you can play to freshen it up. Each one even has it's own unique story. The graphics aren't demanding at all, any computer can run it, but it still looks really good somehow. They are also pretty generous with F2P items. You get special real money items every time you level up. Come and join me!			"

												I love this game! It's so fun, enjoyable, and addicting. It's also unique and the way that you can get mounts is also cool. It is very easy to play since I've already reached the max level of the game and have done raids to get such overpowered gear. What I also truly admire about this game is that every time there is a maintenace. Remember, a maintenance. If that comes in handy. They'll give free items to everyone in the game as an apologize or inconvenience to people who were facing crashes, bugs, or maybe glitches. So far, game is enjoyable, free to play, and fun with friends, families, and cousins to play with. Kepp up the great work! Great job on always providing new content that players can enjoy about the game and giving away free items to newbies who don't much about the game or just started.			"

												Its... addicting. And that's the worst part. I love this game and love how much there is to do in it. The crafting/garden/fishing system is nifty. I just wish it wasn't a pay to win ordeal, where you pretty much had to gamble real money to get decent gear. Earning gold is no problem. It's when you're not sporting decent gear to get into good runs and getting stomped that is upsetting. Sure, its a free game, and that's the catch. It's free. To a point. It's up to you whether or no you want to spend real money on it. Still fun. But to get into a nest with other people is a pain, and dying with a one hit blow that made me give up for a while. I give this game a 7/10			"

												A wonderful MMO RPG game that has graphics that could please Gaben. It's not really a challenge at first because you're GIVEN a great costume, and a pet. If you're into MMO's with perfect graphics, then this is the game for you. Also, the people's faces give you something to laugh about until you forget about them.			"

												Great writing and combat. (Some)NPCs have enjoyable personalities for an MMORPG, and for each town I was in, there was always at least one NPC/questgiver that I loved talking to, and I would do their quests just to get them to say more things. Special attacks look and feel powerful. The ability to choose your difficulty for dungeons is nice, and Abyss is a great challenge.			"

												A lot of fun for those who are really into Real-Time Battle Systems.A good variety of classes (though gender locked, ie: only male swordsmen, and only female archers), an interesting class system, adding a huge variety in class builds and diversity.Its fun and easy to get addicted to, if your really into this sort of play style!Make sure to play with friends or to make friends right away though, it can get pretty boring playing alone, though it does add a bit of challenge, since the classes compliment eachother pretty well.

												Dragon Nest is a fun game if you like to grind. From my experience, the game still has a lot of needed work. I can tell that in the future the game will evolve into one of the top MMORPGs. The only problem with the game are some connection issues that kick you off the game. Although I haven't played for a long time unlike other people, these are issues that can be fixed easily.			"

												dafksdj;fkja;dksfj; THIS GAME IS ONE OF THE BEST FREE TO PLAYS IN EXISTENCE.The combat is spectacular. Never, in any game I have played so far, have I seen such a well-thought-out and complete combat system that allows everyone their own style and flair. It might be one of the coolest combat systems in existence. It's grand, and playing with others makes it so much more fun, to chain combos with others. It's not a FPS, its third-person and allows for so much more freedom. And you get to see spells being cast and moves being made, which makes so much cooler.The monsters are ridiculously easy, but that is overshadowed by the fact that there isn't much grinding in this game. Except for the time I had to wait 10 levels hoping and praying that I would get a wand in a random drop. This game isn't asking for your money unless you want really fancy mounts or cosmetics or costumes; it provides everything you need for free without grinding, and you get everything you need as you progress through the game.I will say that there may be too little clothes for comfort. But the character design and story is mindblowing. Serious props to the devs for taking 9 different classes and creating an overarching storyline that differs in litte ways for each class.And its also not TOO easy -- while leveling up is relatively fast, you need to spend your Skill Points wisely to get new skills and manage your old ones. And the class trees that allow specialization are great, and make the game take on so much more variety. Its great that any two people who start off with the same class will end the game with totally different specializations and playstyles.Overall, the pro's of this amazing game overshadow any possible cons. Great storyline, amazing combat, smart decision-making, and great design.Go get it!			"

												About the game: Dragon nest is an action packed MMORPG. It features unique storylines for each character as well as a great combat system later during the game(Low levels is a bit slow, but it gets MUCH better). It has Nests that you tackle in a party that are an okay difficulty, and normal dungeons you could solo. Nests scale with party somewhat, making it a bit easier solo but fun in a party. TLDR; A great action packed MMORPG with combat like no other. It has unique storylines and fun characters + dialogue. It has okay balancing, along with decent group content as well as some solo content. The latest system; the awakening system polishes up classes so they are more defined than ever before. Every character plays even more vastly different than they did before. The leveling phase is a bit bad at first, but if you can push through and maybe get some friends you can definitely enjoy this mmo. Positives:  - NOT OWNED BY NEXON ANYMORE.  - They've been VERY generous with item giveaways and events so far and its a blast.  - Great combat. Top notch among mmos. No action mmo has come close to this one.  - Decent soundtrack  - Good storylines. Every character is different, some are cliche.. and are REALLY weird.  - Okay questing system, will reach you to level cap for the most part with minimal grinding, it has a tiny bit of grind, but it will bring you through for the most part.  - Decent PvP, a little balance issues right now. But its short and sweet now.  - The new awakening system feels fresh, and it makes the game feel much more smooth.  Negatives:  - Okay amount of content, if you play as much as a regular person its good.  - A bit repetitive with mob types as well as questing. Sometimes you repeat the same dungeon.  - Not all awakenings are released for every class, sadly this does make a bit of a balance gap at the moment.  - Leveling system is quite painful the first time through, but if you get through it becomes an amazing game.Conclusion:A great mmo with more upcoming content as well as new classes. As action packed as it is fast paced its also pretty challenging and has very fluid combat. If you want to try it add VencirGan and maybe bring a couple friends with you to dull out the leveling phase. I've been playing a lot recently and I wouldn't mind helping newcomers level up, so if you want to give it a try give me a shout!RATING: 8/10			"

												While I have played this game for a long time, I've had my fun with it. The combo system is good, but rarely has any effects on actual gameplay other than PVP where literally you cannot win without better stats. This game isn't as Skill to Win as it used to be, according to most of my friends who have played it for a long time. Although this game has a pretty good base and whatnot, grinding on the same dungeons just becomes really boring. Do I recommend this game? Yes!!!The PVP system is a bit flawed, but I can see where it has its fun parts. The dungeon and EXP system itself are pretty good, looting system along with them. But I do not encourage buying stuff in this game with real money, since it's pretty much just a waste.The variety of classes in this game is also a good thing to mention. But some classes definitely rise up higher than others do, which really disappoints me.The story becomes really repetitive but the only entertaining parts are when you get to actually see the story of your own character. Other than that, it's just the main story of the game.But it's all worth it.			"

												Great game to immerse yourself in and see massive amounts of character devleopment. PvE doesn't become grindy, every couple of levels there is another nest and gear set to get, and you consistently become stronger. Also great to play with friends or pick a class that is great at soloing. Either way, an enjoyable experience with hours upon hours gameplay.			"

												Hi, I'm an adventurer of indisclosed gender who randomly came upon a village one day and decided to save a girl I've met only once while she was being chased by a harpy. On the way to being savior of the world I killed every single one of the people dear to me by miraculously trusting the hidden villain 10 times out of 10. But I got a cool weapon from this dragon I killed and it's all okay.I used to give crap to Argenta for verbally abusing me every minute she sees me but she really is right. I am an utterly incompetent fool. I run around making bigger messes of everything, messes that often require one or another npc's life to clean up.But in all seriousness, DN is a decent game.It's a fun time waster. The battle system is fun and I didn't mind the grind (which, compared to some of the mmorpgs I've played in the past, wasn't really difficult at all. When I picked it back up I made cap on my legacy whatever char in 3 days and the other one hit 90s in a week, I wasn't even playing nonstop). I got bored eventually because I didn't really feel committed. And as for the story, well. I guess it's interesting, I was intrigued enough to follow it despite having to run the same 3 dungeons on repeat for each part (honestly, who decides to live in a place constantly infected with monstrocities and decide not to move?) But I was really serious when I say the PC is literally the stupidest, most gullible person alive. The main quest is always the shady person out of the cast of the characters asking you to fetch some god awful, powerful evil device for ""good"" and the pc shrugging and saying ""Why not? What harm could you possibly do with it, guy I just met yesterday?"" Tldr; If you like the battle system and don't mind playing it like a solo player (because just about everything except hardcore endgame content is doable alone if you have enough time and skill), then this is great. If you are expecting a welcome community, this isn't for you. If not for having friends that asked me to play this game with them I could probably go from level 1 to cap without talking to a single soul and that's something most people (me included) is not prepared to do.

												(Note: my steam playtime does not show my playtime with Nexon's standalone launcher from during the beta, actual playtime is around 80 hours)With regards to the PvE content, it contains the standard MMO tropes of leveling: experience points and stat based gear progression.The dungeons are fun, the monsters are neat, and the storyline is alright.The varied enemy types actually do different attacks and have slightly different A.I., even between palatte swaps.  If it looks different, it behaves differently.The cut scenes are entertaining i suppose, but its really all about combat.Leveling does eventually slow down dramatcially, once you run out of the standard ""go kill everything in this dungeon"" quests, requiring you to re-play dungeons and boss rooms, over and over, just to level up.With regards to the actual overall character progression, its mainly about upgrading your weapons (and armor too of course).This is where the Pay to Win comes in, but ill get to that in a minute.If you want to upgrade an item, you can minimally improve it up until level eight (the weapons level, not the character).Every time you upgrade an item, you spend the materials to perform the upgrade.Occasionally, the upgrade fails, meaning you lose the mats but keep the item.After level eight, you risk several random outcomes: breaking the weapon (or armor) entirely, downgrading the weapon by 3 levels, merely losing your mats with no change in stats,or actually upgrading the item by one level.The potential to completely lose your item is very real, and is especially painful, making you go back to previously played content to get a replacement, which you would then need to upgrade again.So, you can lose your item on a bad ""roll"" of the upgrade luck dice (metaphorical).What can be done about this?You can pay real money to buy ""seals"", which protect your item from breaking. (but not from the other potentially bad outcomes, such as deleveling the item.)The pay to win ethos permeates the rest of the game as well, with visual changes not actually being tied to the majority of the gear you can get through gameplay.Its sort of like if TF2 only let you buy hats, no crafting, no drops; they can only be bought with real money.The other problem with these ""costume"" items, is that they also give your character stats, such as ""permenant run speed increase of X %"", or ""+ str, + int"" etc.Now, on to the PvP stuff!  This is where DN shines.The PvP combat is epic, there are juggles, and tons of fun to use skills on timers (much like WoW).  DN combat is more about positional awareness, but it still relies on knowing what cooldowns are not active for your enemies.However, since there are juggles, if your ""get out of a juggle"" cooldowns are cooling down, then you're just hosed and can take a significant amount of damage while not being able to do anything about it, much like playing Marvel vs Capcom.This issue is even more present, since you're fighting more than one enemy at a time.Also, since DN is so focused on what gear you have and how upgraded it is, you are forced to play the PvE to level up, to get good gear, and to get the mats to improve your gear.  Additionally this means that PvP is more of a side thought, than a legitimate alternate way to level up or progress.Overall i had tons of fun with DN, but once you understand the upgrade system, why it is Pay to Win, and how PvE recycles content, id say its a worthy way to spend some time, but ultimately i felt cheated by its Cash Shop.Beware, Nexon may only be the distributor, but all of their games are notorious for abusing the Cash Shop mechanic, just like Dragon Nest does.

												Dragon Nest is probably one of the top 5 Free MMORPGs out there. With a top notch combat leveling system, and best in class PvP action, Dragon nest is defently a game that should be considered playing, if a fan of MMOs. The game starts you off with selecting a class of your choice and each of these classes have their own seperate main story lines that really add to the replayability. Keep in mind that these classes are gender locked and in total have 9 different options to chose from, The art style of the game is more anime and some of the NPC voice acting is hard to get through without cringing. The soundtrack is honestly top notch and when parred with the soundeffects of the game from the skills/abilities or simply basic attacking, creates an audio masterpiece. PvE inculdes a long enjoyable story sepperate for each class, alongside 100s of side quests and daily quests. PvP is extremely fun, arguably the best of all MMOs, all though, i wouldent recomend before level 35, due to most of the PvP community consists of max level charecters (90), and due to them being max level, not only do they have more experience, but they can easily trap you in a chain of attacks due to your lack of skills at a low level. Dragon nest is a heavily instansed bassed game, but if you can get passed the 5-15 seconds loading screens, this shouldent bother you. In the terms of character customisation, outside of the cash shop, your options are extremely lacking, however if you are willing to invest 5-10 dollars, you can begin to gain some freedom. On the topic of the cash shop, there are tons of options for not only costume, but actual in-game items aswell. Through steam you are able to use your steam wallet for the cash shop.Pros:-Top notch combat.-Tons of content in PvE.-Outstanding party play.-Unique dungeons.-Very cool combat animations.-Dungeons rate performances.-Competative and Enjoyable PvP.-Main Story line differs for each class.-Consistant art style .Cons:-Charecter appearence customisation is EXTREMELY lacking outside of the cash shop and micro transactions-Gender locked classes.-Some of the faces are just.....bad.-No customisable UI.-Heavily instansed bassed game.-Cringe worthy voice acting.-while yes there are a lot of side quests, some of them are straight up anoying.

												This game WAS good before the most recent patch. Now I couldn't even jokingly suggest someone play this unless you are okay with there being nothing but a condensed story and the game being too easy to even learn your class until the level cap.Played far too much before getting the Steam version to fix a bugged skill on one character, but now... wasted download. None of the game is worth playing until late 80-90, and even that is apparently terrible and either mind-numbingly easy or the wrong version to be possible, since this patch nerfed the majority of everyone's abilities.

												I used to play on SEA server, and if I still remember correctly, Steam would put player on NA server I think?But the review would include both perspective anyway.Pros:-You get to kill dragon, gotta kill them all, Drago----you get to shoot beam from your swords, cast laser beam from the heavens, time stop people, shoot nightmarish arrows that chases people forever, launch a horde of ducks, play with Thor Hammer and even feel fabulous with lightning sparks booming around you.-Immersive combat system for both pve and pvp, very-Socially fun, especially with your friends IRL.Neutral (as varies between different country servers):-music-character (including npc) voicing-events (lay mostly on effort side instead of real-cash bonus side)Cons:-class discrimination and inbalance exists-hack and slashes skills does not cut through clothes-grind-repetetive-RNG over RNG over RNG, and effort intolerance.-gear can be accessed into a higher level in pvp with pay2win contents.-long loading screen throughout the world if you do not have a good spec-most of those Pros only applies in Late Game.despite being a free MMO (as usual), I'd still say the pros overweight the cons, though I would still not recommend it to player that are planning to dedicate most of their lifetime on this one since it gradually dies down and lower the element of [social entertainment]. 6/10 would definitely solo a dragon again with dead team mates.

												Honestly, I do not see how this game has a 'very positive' review score when compared to similar Free-to-play Action MMORPGs. First of all, the combat is very good. When you attack and kill things it has weight to it. You feel like you are striking your foes. But that is all that is good in this game.THE BAD:The UI is clunky and not customizable at all. You can't even see more then one action bar. You can't move UI elements to appease. These are things that should be standard in any MMO since 2003.You can't keybind more then one action bar full of actions. 1-8 is all you can assign and you have 3 classes worth of skills. This is nonsense.Loading screens everywhere! Join a dungeon, loading screen. Kill two groups of mobs, loading screen to next area. Kill a group of mobs, go to loading screen to next area. That is INSANE! More loading screens than a PSOne game.Balance. The game is way, way too easy. From what I read on the forums they nerfed enemy damage and increased EXP multiplier so that you can reach level cap really fast. So people migth think that is a good thing but to me, personally, it is not. Learning the game is half the fun. Do you really want idiots that barely know how to play in PvP and in your Guild because they reached max level cap in less than a week? There is no way they know their class.Loot at the end of the dungeon/raid is random. So it's very possible that you do a dungeon over  many, many times to get a piece of a equipment that you want. This is crazy. I had to do a dungeon 10 times before I finally got a better weapon.Cash Shop is full of ""7-day"" items. You basically pay real money for temporary items. I know it's common in most Korean MMOs but this is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. All real-money transactions should be permanantly tied to your account.Another problem is if you go on hiatus for a month they lock your account. Don't be surprised if when you come back from vacation your characters will be gone. You have to contact support and provide detailed information to get it back. This can take up to a week and by then you probably don't want to play anymore.			"

												It's like COD, except not first person, not a shooting game, doesn't have dlc, is completely free, and isn't a rehashed pile of sh*t.Being serious though, it truly is a pretty good game. Sure, the difficulty is p*ss easy until some end-game raids, and running the same dungeons over and over can get a little repetitive, but if you like mmorpgs with very flashy abilities, this is a great game. I remember reading once that the Alchemist class has an ability with so many flashing lights, it tends to crash people's computers (it then got blacklisted from many PvP tournaments). There isn't any real need to spend real money, as there are no pay-walls and the 'special' gear is mostly just cosmetics. I wouldn't recommend it for everyone, but it is free-to-play, so all you're really losing is your time (which I think is well spent, as it is always fun pummeling monsters). Another really nice thing is that the story is actually really interesting. Each character has their own story line too, and my personal favorite is the Assassin one, which has to do with time travel, though I won't spoil it. My one problem with this game is that too few clothes are worn. But some people would consider that a plus.And hey, it's not under Nexon anymore. That's gotta count for something, right?			"

												Dragon Nest is a rare gem in the vast market of free to play MMOs. The game requires dedication, but if you stick with it the game can be extremely fun. The community is wonderful, and most people are willing to help. Make sure you join a guild because they will probably be more than willing to help you out. The first guild I ever joined was willing to gear me when I reached the previous level cap ( no guild I was ever a part of in Wow would do that). I am still with that guild and glad that I have stuck with them. The only real downside to the game is the time it takes for new content to come out. If nexon would keep the US servers up with the servers in SEA that would be awesome. So, in closing I would just like to state that dragon nest is one of the best MMOs you could ever play, but be prepared to spend some time and maybe a little money (only if you want to look awesome).

DN also includes character customization, awesome cutscenes, helpful NPCs, enhancing items and towns to meet up with friends... or make new ones. We can't forget Parties or Guilds, you can make those too!The designs and scenery are beautiful, and the enemies are easily beat in a team. This game is a 9/10 for me. (:			"

												wow, great game, and im just starting out. why play this game? ive tried countless mmos, and most follow the same pattern, click enemy to attack, sell your stuff, level up lame attacks, oh, and dont forget to occasionally get cool stuff, if you pay alot.this mmo offers not only a variety of classes, but very smooth transitioning between quests, as well as a good map, nice interface, and awesome graphics. my only complaints are: 1. the classes are gender based. this doesnt ruin the game one bit for me, it would just be nice if perhaps i could play a male engineer, or a female assassin, or whatever opposite gender they have2. the game can be a bit laggy in the main hub like areas, although i do play the game on a less than ideal computer, so this can also be disregarded.3. the overall choices based on character looks are suboptimal at best, with a handful of hairdoes, colors, and eyes. though no worries as youll hardly see the face anyways, and all the few hairstyles the DO offer are pretty good looking anyways.aside from these, i HIGHLY recommend the game. if your searching steam for a good rich, awesome class based mmo to download, take it from me whos downlaoded 20+ different ones and at least give this one a try. :o) "

It's a game that's gonna be up for many more years to come and has many classes to choose from. I created so many memories in it and had a lot of adventures in it. They're always updating it and always giving us new outfits, new mounts, new items etc.  Very well class balanced and always bringing out new maps to try on. They even made a movie for this game, enough said. Try it and join us on this awesome adventure. :D DN lover 4 life.			"

												ive played this game for 4 Years and it is one hell of an rpg, commuinity is awesome players are awesome and 50/50 chance you will get help if you need it, but this game reqires dedecation i never really got the chance to talk to a dev/GM in all the time i played but i heard they are preety cool. Anyways if you are looking for an awesome rpg this is one to try out, but i must warn you, it is a pay to be able to kick♥♥♥♥♥in pve type of game, pay to win if you would like me to put it a better way. in this game if you want the best gear you got to be fully loaded not in cash but in gear, you have to be ready for anything the enemys throw your way and in order to increase your gear to top notch you need to spend cash so that you wont lose to the clumsy black smith who should be a pro at crafting gear . Anyways if you havent tryed this give it a try even though i wrote all of the above, give it a try it is a good game and if you like it and say to your self that you are going to dedicate your self to it, then spend cash on it ''pro tip'' leave the vanity items for last and craft your gear first. crafting your gear to 6 is free but byond that point it will break. look for the shop and buy jellys and you will be able to use that to protect your gear from breaking. oh and one last thing looks can be deciving in this game some people dont have good gear and can play very good and other look really expericed but they dont play that great so if they need help give em a hand maybe one day they will help you. teamwork is the keyin this game. 10/10 for me just wish getting jellys was much easy if you have questions about anything just send me a Message and il help you out with what i can.

												Dragon Nest has me questioning why I didn't get into action MMO's sooner.The game itself has a relatively small community, but offers some awesome content and events for the players that do consistently log on. It sports some anime inspired graphics. While still giving some insanely cool and much more dark detail to most mobs and each boss at the end of every portal.Dragon Nest starts you out in a city called ""Mana Ridge"" which unfortunately seems like a cliche, because it ♥♥♥♥ing is. The game doesn't really start being eye popping until you step outside of the city and engage in your first dungeon. At that point I find you start to really appreciate the games graphical prowess and charming game mechanics. While being cliche with the story and theme, Dragon Nest really does well with its combat. It has you enter a portal into a certain area (think Guild Wars), and from that you can choose one of the varied number of ""runs"" you can take from there; you then have 5 options for which difficulty you want to run the dungeon on, easy for chumps or abyss for MEN. If I choose abyss (which the game recommends you only do in a party of 4), not only am I a badass mother ♥♥♥♥er. But I also get the advantage of better loot, and more rewards and XP at the end of the run. This part of Dragon Nest has always been my favorite thing in the game, even though the idea isn't original, and even though it literally has you do the same thing over and over.That being said, the game sucks in these categories. Well, one category. PvP. When it was released, it was the biggest cluster ♥♥♥♥ you could imagine. It promised fluid attacks, and engaging combat. What it did deliver was a trash hitbox system and incredibly out of balance classes. One lower leveled warrior could hit a stun, and just slaughter people. It drew a very distinct line between PvE and PvP oriented classes. I played it again recently on a new character and while some of the before ignored issues were resolved (The hit boxes are much much better now) It just didn't have the charisma the PvE combat had and continues to seperate and distinguish classes as PvP or PvE oriented. Especially warriors. They still stomp everybody.So, in closing. Although very cliche at a first glance, and lacking in PvP gameplay. The game does definitely offer an outstanding time for a group of friends or for somebody looking to kill some time online. If you don't mind being called a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for playing anyway.nexon/10			"

												Combat-wise, there is no competition. Dragon Nest is truly one of a kind. No other action mmo can hold a candle to DN and anywhere else you look feels like a step down. DN excels with its fluid movement, hundreds of unique skills, iframes, super-armor and third person, NON-TAB-TARGETTING style.I've been playing this game for 2 years +, and 200 hrs shown here was just during a certain two months when I was playing on steam. One of the few mmo that I can always go back to as it is updated with new content/events monthy!			"

												It's fun in the beginning, and when you get to the hours ive played, there is nothing else to do. You log on, check for raids, check the marketplace, do some daily quests, maybe PvP (not balanced at all).  The only fun in this game is leveling up new classes and using new skills. Other than that, if you dont put in real money to get good gear, you will get kicked from every high level party out there.			"

												i got to level 50 in a day this game in particular is the friendliest game by far that i've seen to new players and forget about the costumes being paid for and all thats asociated with money for a bit this game is incredibly more balanced than almost every other mmo or rpg out there however i do want to see diiferent types of missions instead of just nests, dungeons and you know it just gets a little boring but then theres the ecxitement of leveling up and opening that level up present that makes going through all these dungeons and nests worth it it adds that extra spice to the game now as for pvp i dont know how the balancing is as i have never tried it however the community is extremely nice from what i've seen but im only a level 50 so i dont know how the nest raids and stuff go in terms of community wise but none the less alot of people hate this game for it's cosmetics mainly but if you guy's or girl's pay attention you can get a costume from the guild so in conclusion i rather like this game for what it is : )   (aside from the trolls that appear every once in a while)			"

												I'd recommend this game to you if it was still 2012.This game has turned to ♥♥♥♥ to be completely honest - and it has done so in almost every aspect thinkable. The story is boringly repetetive and cliche, the servers lag in most countries so you will teleport back and forth and not be able to hit anything, the community is pretty much non-existant and the people left are max level so they'll ignore you, the devs changed the difficulty system so you may now only play the early levels on the easiest settings, and worst of all: the game is far too easy.It seems to have the opposite problem to most mmos, in that it's not 'grindy' or difficult, it's just running through every dungeon and killing everything a few times and then moving onto the next dungeon (It is grindy in that aspect). It feels more like a poorly made and boringly long singleplayer game that still has the lag issues of being a f2p asian mmo. Playing this is just like waiting for the ending to come, and if a game has that quality, then just go back to real life since it's the same♥♥♥♥♥♥ but with characters that actually matter.The only way I recommend this game is if you bring together a bunch of friends and play through it in short bursts as a party whilst not taking it too seriously. In 2012/13 you could have done this with players you met in game, but now the only community left are at max level as stated.Base Game: 7/10What You Get: 4/10			"

You may have to keep clicking the confirm button from your Email repeatedly until it actually decides to confirm your Email.  Had to chase this little nugget of information down to get to the next glitch.Second issue:  The disappearing cursor...Apparently the ""workaround"" is to lower your display size below 150% so that your mouse cursor will show once the game launches....Not sure if it worked because the game locked up my PC when I tried to log in that time...You may not have any issues depending on your set up...no idea.  Im running a laptop with a 4k monitor which may have had something to do with the cursor issue...So be warned you may have to use some finesse to even start playing this game.

												I tried this game a few years back because it was cute and challenging. The skillbased attack and dodge system meant you could challenge much stronger enemies if you paid attention, giving you a shot as only slightly better gear. All around it was fun and didn't require a large time commitment. I really liked the boss battles, where they had a ton of HP, an interesting ability rotation and the ability to spawn minions at certain points.Now it is terribly boring. They give you so many over powered costume and item sets for advancing through the starting levels that you blow up everything in your path. Bosses get one-shoted! I like my costume. I look cool and the costume buffs you up. Now I no longer have any incentive to collect other items. You also gain XP so quickly that all the quests I can access are no longer a challenge and I don't see a way to move to a tougher area. This game is totally unbalanced and from what I have heard has no end game.It has wonderful art direction and I really would like to enjoy it. I tried a naked run to see if that would make things fun again. I still destroyed everything. The bosses lasted for almost a minute. It just makes me sad.			"

Dragon Nest is a fast paced, hack-and-slash MMORPG. I enjoy the many classes and advancements in Dragon Nest, such as the Warrior, Cleric, or Assassin! Obviously there's more than those three. Dragon Nest is almost revolutionary due to having a different fighting style, not just point and click.Overall: I'd give it a 6.8/10. There is so much to the game already, but there can be more that could be improved.Controls & Handling: 8/10. The controls are easy to learn, but it ranges from class to class. The Warrior is immensely faster than any other class due to unlocking the dash ability at level 10.Graphics: 5/10. The graphics are subpar compared to other games such as Aion: Ascension or Guild Wars 2, but it gets the job done. The main point of Dragon Nest is definitely not graphicsStoryline: 8/10. The storyline is centered around your specific class saving the world, which is kind of stereotypical, but once you get into the game, it goes into the lore. Such as the  aging difference of archers/elves or how the Cleric becomes high priest of an organization. Really tedious to start, but great to read through once you've gotten interested.Music: 6/10. The music kind of just... fits. Although, during dungeons it can be quiet until you start attacking an enemy, but once the music gets going, you really get hyped for battle and it makes you have a sense of urgency.			"

												Nexon has developed a reputation for releasing games that, while great on a gameplay level, are filled with microtransactions and alterations to the game to force you to buy them. While Dragon Nest continues this legacy to a degree, it's not as bad as other games the company has put out. From a gameplay standpoint Dragon Nest is very fun with its combo-based combat. The six classes (as of this review) are all fun to play in their own ways, and the specializations they can take let them further define their styles in unique ways. While the early levels can be a bit of a slog, once you get to around level 30 the game really opens up in terms of the skills you get. And whether your fighting alone, with a friend, or against a friend the combat is always enjoyable.It's unfortunate then that the rest of the game around it is a little shallow. Quests are your standard affair, either go here and kill this or go here and collect this. A few quests spice things up in interesting ways such as giving you an overpowered NPC helper or giving you a unique enemy to fight, but such quests are few and far between. Thankfully if fighting AI monsters gets boring you can always fight your fellow man in PvP. PvP is fairly balanced (with a few exceptions) with an emphasis on personal skill rather than your gear and stats.This brings me to the much despised part of any Nexon game, the cash shop. While games like Mabinogi and Maplestory are pretty much pay-to-win when it comes to their cash shop, Dragon Nest really doesn't feel that way. Sure the costumes give nice stat boosts and there are items that protect your gear from breaking while enhancing them, but such things aren't necessary unless your absolutely serious about min-maxing. Even then you should be fine as long as you invest in a decent skill build and have practiced enough to use your skills to their fullest. You even get a special level up reward box that gives out certain cash shop items like storage and inventory space, meaning you don't have to spend a dime so long as your patient.I have a feeling alot of people have/will blow this game off just because Nexon is publishing it, which is a shame. While it has its flaws Dragon Nest is a pretty decent action game if you put some time in it. It might not be the best game ever but it certainly is leagues above some of Nexon's other games. I advise you to give it a try and at least play up till level 30 or so before you pass your final judgement on the game.			"

												WHY WONT IT WORK!!!!????? Ok so I installed it a week ago and it keeps giving me an error say it has to be launched from steam, whuch it IS. Ive tried reinstalling, deleting all file and rebooting it, restarting the cpu, launching it from an administrator and pretty much all of the general stuff. Now I know im supposed to download it from the website if it breaks on here BUT the thing is I already tried that and my CPU firewall picked up a virus. HALP. great game doh, five stars :D!			"

												This is a game with similar gameplay to other action mmos such as Vindictus, C9, etc. At first I was skeptical of this game but it actually provides a decent amount of fun. I took the time to try out different classes to see how they were and I can say each class seems worth playing, never did I feel like any class was downright boring, useless or underpowered. You do normal attacks using the left mouse button and special attacks, which are usually kicks, with the right mouse button. One thing I didn't quite like was the fact that your skills are all placed on hotkeys, which imo, defeats the purpose of this game being an action mmo. The graphics are childlike in appearance and remind me a lot of the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles series though it's a little disturbing how this game is with certain female characters and also ""panty shots"".When you create a character, you get a choice between 3 or 4 different hairstyles and clothing options, giving this game very minimal appearance customization. Overall this game seems good for what it is but I can't recommend it over Vindictus though for people who don't care for Vindictus, you could certainly do worse than this game.			"

												Dragon Nest is not a normal MMORPG, it is one of the best rpg's I've ever played it doesn't use cheap auto attacking it has a real hack n' slash system in the game.  It takes skill to play this you need to be ready to dodge strike critical strike and power strike.  The graphics are very nice and the bloom is very fitting.  The game has multiple characters that may be gender locked but it's still very fun to play.  It has an actual story with real cutscenes and voice acting and I find the story very interesting to follow.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a nice new fresh experience in rpgs.  The game does a great job of making you feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥at a low level and you just feel so awesome when you take on giant bosses all by yourself I just love it!  Please if any of my friends get this game msg me we will play right away!.9.5/10			"

												Dragon Nest is, in my opinion, an incredible game. I can't really think of anything I don't like about it, although I'm sure there's a few flaws in it, they're certainly not significant at all. The art is genuinely pleasing for an anime-style game, there's a pretty good choice of classes, with my only complaint being that they are genderlocked, but I haven't really found that to be much of a problem, personally. I like all of the dungeons and how they all have their own theme and the different difficulties are definitely a nice bonus. I find that it is also quite possible to be good at the game without spending money on it, and the Dragon Vault gives good options for character customization by allowing different durations for the equipment items, along with stats on most of them. I find Dragon Nest to be an all around amazing game, currently my favorite, and I would definitely recommend it. :)			"

I shouldn't have to go out of my way to make your game run on my machine, Nexon. It's a tragedy, really.

The gameplay's not bad... but the game just feels like another generic entry into the Asian-styled Loli grind RPG genre. It didn't hold my attention for very long.But it's free, so give it a try if you like.			"

												It's pretty much a World of Warcraft C9/Vindictus graphics wise. C9 and Vindictus are dead, Dragon Nest is still very much alive. The combos aren't nearly as good as C9, which makes it very newbie friendly, but at the same time the Raids are much more difficult, catering to the hardcore players. If you give this game a shot, at least play until level 24, when you get the fun skills. When I first tried it out I dismissed it at level 12 or so because it was generic, but obviously I just didn't have any of the good skills by then. They really did a good job distributing buffs and debuffs throughout the classes, every raid contains no multiples, and the ones that do only have one or two, making most classes desirable. As for p2win, you can get virtually everything by grinding, which may take a bit, but it's certainly not as p2win as most other F2P titles. The only major downside is the gender locked classes, the tinkerer looks like she's an 8 year old girl... But if you can see past that, it's most definitely one of the best games out there.			"

												When you think about people Role Playing you probably cringe, but Dragon's Nest is a master piece where you might find yourself naturally role playing. You put yourself into your character. People become your close friends. You are extremely social and you wonder why you can't be like that in real life. Well I'm talking about myself here but maybe you can relate. Anyway, This game is like a over the shoulder dungeoning mmorpg and it's pretty fun. It's genderlocked and there's little customization as far as default goes but that's honestly not even a big deal it like doesn't bother me at all what so ever. It bothers me on other games but this game is just like so good that you over look the cons. except for one con that you can't possibly over look, and that's the fact that it's in the hands of Nexon. But whatever, only slight lag and it's not really pay to win. Furthermore PvP is pretty balanced.TL;DR 3rd person fun MMORPG play it unless you generally enjoy your♥♥♥♥♥♥taste.			"

												Dragon Nest is like your classic RPG. You do quests and level up, yada yada ya. However, unlike games such as Mabinogi or WoW, the combat system embraces fluidity of skills. It's not turn-based and moves can be used whenever they're available during dungeons. The skill point system can be tailored to one's playstyle. It's quite enjoyable to play with friends, but playing in public parties is tolerable. The currency is easily gained and lost through progression and you don't need to spend money to access moves or slots for moves *cough* Spiral Knights *cough*. The NX cash shop, or the Dragon Vault, presents a variety of items such as costumes, which you don't really need to succeed, or functional consumables which the game gives you for free. The game's content is ever-expanding in the storyline and a lot of effort is put into it (even if most of you probably click as fast as you can through quests without reading). There aren't a multitude of downsides that can't be solved by the player themselves, but first and foremost: Dragon Nest is licensed (?) through Nexon. Their customer support is horrid. The couple of weeks before December had a lot of problems with connection, disconnection, and overall lag. However, the compensation for issues is usually worth it. Another problem is that single-player play can get monotonous because like many RPGs, the game is grindy, but that can either be remedied by playing in a party or y'know, taking a break. The community is riddled with individuals of almost all ages, ranging from the stereotypical whiny, slightly-illiterate ""twelve-year old"", to people who are married and have kids. One last drawback is that to run certain dungeons (nests), public parties usually require players to already be geared upon joining, however many guilds and other players are nice enough to help individuals who are new to levels and the game overall.edit: elaborated monotony			"

												First off, you more likely to enjoy this game if you enjoy anime and manga (Japanese Media), since the chracters and art is stylized in that direction. I wouldn't say that all people who enjoy anime would enjoy this game, its just a common trend I've seen in players. Things that I've been Impressed in this game:STORY: As a F2P game, its got cut scenes and great voice acting for many of the characters.

												First off, you more likely to enjoy this game if you enjoy anime and manga (Japanese Media), since the chracters and art is stylized in that direction. I wouldn't say that all people who enjoy anime would enjoy this game, its just a common trend I've seen in players. Things that I've been Impressed in this game:STORY: As a F2P game, its got cut scenes and great voice acting for many of the characters.

												Really fun game to play with friends.  Still pretty fun to play alone, but you miss out on alot of good content if you don't play with others.I really enjoy how often they add to the game with extra content, items, pets, mounts, nest, and level caps.One of the best things about this game is the story line....I normally skip dialog in games like these, but it quickly caught my eye in the very first town you start in.  The NPCs are wonderful in this game xD "

												I would normally recommend this game, but for as little gameplay I have achieved, it is not frickin worth it.I originally downloaded this game so my sister and I could play together, but that could not be achieved. EVERY SINGLE TIME I WENT INTO A DUNGEON WITH HER, IT WOULD DISCONNECT ME. If I stood in the town too long, it would disconnect me too. it would disconnect me if I went hard mode on dungeons. A lot of the time it would just fail to load up. 90% of all the time I played the game was just trying to get THE STUPID THING TO WORK. When I did get to play, it was by myself but the gameplay was good. So if you have a computer that is good and CONSTANTLY doesn't disconnect you from games, I suggest you try it.			"

												Ok, I'm going to have to preface my review of this game with saying that I do not have at the time of this review, a character at the level 70 level cap. I plan to do so though.As with all of my other reviews, they will be scaled from 0 to 10 on a few criteria.Gameplay: 7.5/10: This game would get a perfect 10, if a few things were reduced/removed. A. GRINDING, Be prepared to grind your♥♥♥♥♥off in this game. When the game's level cap was 50, it took me several MONTHS to hit 50 on my non-boosted toon. B. Gear Upgrading, Ok, so in this game like classic Nexon fasion there is a gear upgrading ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t system. You have to spend real money to get anywhere near past about +10 on your gear, though some people are generous enough to post the jellies on the Auction House, for ♥♥♥♥TONS of Gold... These are the only things really hampering the gameplay. Otherwise, it's very fun, action based MMORPG with alot of flashy skills.Graphics: 9/10: This game would again get a perfect 10, if 1 thing was tweaked. visual effects of the Tinkerer class.

 watch that video if you want an explination (a very funny one)Audio: Japan/Korean Voices: 10/10: American Voices: 8/10:  There used to be a mod for the game that added in the Korean voice actors for all of the classes, but it didnt continue after about Kali got released, If I could read Korean, I would be playing KDN because the voices are like 3000x better in that game. The american ones are just a bit too cheezy at some times, though some lines are funny. also, Shield Charge in KDN is one of my favorite lines along with the American version of Justice Crash.Overall: 8.5 out of 10. I'm actually going to agree with IGN on this one, it's a good place to dip your toes into the F2P genera of games, and a good place to stick. PvP is fun, PvE isnt that bad, just alot of grinding. If there was a Maybe button for the Do you recommend this game, I would probably hit that one, but Yes will be good enough.Edit: This game is now in the hands of the Parent Company/Original Creators EyeDentity! So, updates will most likely come sooner, and the general quality of the game will improve!			"

This game not focus on pvp and more to pve as everytime you go out from the city/village, you wrap into your own 'channel' so to speak unless you're making a party beforehand.

												I did'nt really enjoy it that much, im sure it has a great story, but just like i would in WoW, i don't pay attention to story, and because of that the game isnt recommended. Also, they spoon feed you what you need, GOOD MMORPG's don't, they are meant to be a challenge for you and your friends to work together on. On ""hard"" mode, its really not hard at all, it just takes more time to complete because the are more enemies, they are not really even that stronger. The idea of going into multiple worlds for one quest isn't something that helps the game either, sure WoW does it, but they make it work because its open world, you are free to do what you want, this game not so much , it relies on it's story TOO MUCH. i rate this game 3/10			"

												I'm astounded by all the positive reviews.  This game is not only a themepark, but I've never seen smaller themepark levels in my life.  I mean, it's like you go into a large closet, when you kill the mosters in there, all 8 of them, you move to a new closet kill another few monsters, and then another.  What?  That's a game?There's no open world by any stretch of the imagination.  This isn't even remotely an MMO.  If you could compeltely revamp the game so you could actually explore a world without hitting a zone exit every 3 seconds (and I mean, 3 seconds), you might have had a decent game here.I have no idea how people can play games like this, especially if your first games MMO's were UO, AC, EQ, and so on.  Bleah.  I played it for less than an hour and uninstalled it.  So much for the positive reviews.  It's TERRIBLE and pointless.			"

												I highly recommend this game. While there are not a whole big list of options for the character customization, the storyline and overall gameplay make up for this. Leveling up isn't a huge chore as long as you have friends to help you. I really enjoy this game as it's fun and helps keep me from getting bored.			"

												Dragon Nest has the smoothest fighting mechanics I have ever seen in an MMORPG. The People who run the servers are the nicest bunch and ACTUALLY TAKE WHAT PEOPLE SAY AND WANT INTO CONSIDERATION, The game is based around personal improvment and makes you want to play it for longer.Grinding sounds pretty boring right? Well the fighting just feels so good that grinding isn't a chore!!! The only negative I have found in this game is the lack of flexibiltiy when it comes to gender choices because they are allready set with the class you choose. But gender doesn't really matter in this game.The story is excellent and is easy to follow! No confusion, and doesn't even have to be done, great cut scenes and each character has an individial story and they all are connected to eachother (kinda like a puzzle). P.S. The fighting moves are great and also the PvP is smexy (there are no annoying♥♥♥♥♥factions)			"

												Dragons Nest is an MMORPG game, and a pretty interesting one I find. The game isn't turn based, its actually real time, which is cool, its played from a kind of MMO view, but in a way plays sort of like Diablo. It has many different Dungeons that you go into to complete quests, and each Dungeon has a boss. There are also 6 classes, and each are pretty unique. And have some pretty cool flashy abilities, as well as 2 subclasses for each.The story I don't find to be super compelling, but its decent I guess. The graphics are a cartoonish style, which is fine and works for me really. Unless your not a fan of cartoon style it shouldn't bother you.One thing I kind of dislike about the game is the lack of customization, you can't even change your gender, each class is set to a specific gender, which is kind of disappointing as I really like customization on characters. There is very little of that in this game however. But it doesn't make the game bad or anything.The dungeons are kind of easy at first, but get pretty tough pretty steadily, before long you won't be able to do every dungeon on master difficulty with ease, and you will need to turn the difficulty lower, or get a few friends to help.Each time you enter a Dungeon you can select a difficulty, which affects how much XP you get and other rewards. And the dungeons can get challanging like I said, even if the first couple aren't especially with friends. But overall the game is pretty fun I find, especially with a buddy or two. Its a fresh nice MMO which I find enjoyable as you bash through tons of enemies alone or with your friends. And aquire juicy loot and cool spells.And the fact its free means I think you should atleast try it if you get the chance.			"

												I highly recommend this game but DO NOT download the STEAM VERSION. Go to Nexon's official website at http://dragonnest.nexon.net/ and download their client instead. The steam version is regularly plagued by log-in and patching issues and the only fix is to re-download the game every single time. Nexon and Steam doesn't seem to care about this version anymore.Now, on to the review! If you want action-oriented MMORPG with flashy / cool-looking moves then Dragon Nest is the game for you. You have your basic rpg classes in the form of Warrior, Archer, Cleric and Sorcerer. The other available classes are Tinkerer (a sort of engineer) and Dancer. Upcoming classes are Assassin and Lancer.The world is instance type wherein areas (including towns) are separated like dungeons. Although, the towns are very big themselves. The dungeons get bigger and bigger as you progress into the game. Lastly, the environment details are well made and numerous.You gain exp in the game by killing mobs in dungeons, clearing the dungeons themselves and completing NPC quests. When you gain a level you get skill points which you can use to unlock your skills. Core stats are pre-set by the game. Pretty much a standard level and skill system. There's a nifty feature wherein you can see a demo of a skill first before you get it. That way, you can see if you'll like the skill or not.Exp is very fast from Level 1 to 50. 50 to 70 is when the grind starts but still doable and not boring because of the awesome combat system. If you're a hardcore player that can sit a whole day in front of a computer then you can get to the level cap in a week or so. If you're a casual player like me, at level 50 onwards you can gain 2 levels a day or 4 while still being able to stand up and do other stuff. That's pretty fast by today's MMORPG standards.I won't go into the other details of the game because to be honest, it's very big even though it's instanced type. I just provided feedback on the basic features that players tend to look forward to.So again, if you're into action and flashy moves, this is the game for you. You're not really missing anything by not dowloading the Steam version so go the Nexon website I provided on this review and get their client instead. Trust me, it'll be less hassle in the long run.Nexon Dragon Nest Official Website:http://dragonnest.nexon.net/ "

												I've recently gone over my review and noticed it was... rather plain, and didn't give any indication as to the actualy quality of this game, so allow me to elaborate. Dragon Nest is an Action RPG made by Nexon and, what I would call, like Vindictus' younger brother. The combat is very involved as compared to other MMORPG's and skills are very satisfying to use. All-in-all, I would say Dragon Nest is a very fun MMORPG and if you like Vindictus, you will most likely enjoy this game.Pros:- Cutesy Anime Style (Maybe a con if you're not into that?)- Runs fairly well- Satisfying/Solid Combat- Straight-forward and easy to understand- Not Pay-to-win (Last I checked anyway...)- Has the general quality one can expect from a Nexon game- Panty ShotsCons:- Progress slows down rather significantly around level 40 (Cap is like 80, I think?)- Difficult to gear-up later on- PvP is incredibly brokenThe bottom line is, I haven't really had any bad experiences with Dragon Nest, and it's F2P, so why not give it a try?

												This game is blood boilingly exciting, the combat is challenging at times, but is extremely fun. I play with my best friend and we have fun clearing the dungeons on the harder difficulties. I love experimenting with each class. (can't wait for the assassin!) I also enjoy the contrast between the character looks and the monster looks. It goes from ""oh, that's nice."" to ""Oh GOD oh, what the hell IS that thing... THAT'S AN ORC??!! I've never seen an orc like that before. Who designed these monstrosities??!! WTF is goin on????"" I love every bit of this game and I'll spend endless hours playing it in the future. Take note NOT to be discourged because of the gender-locked classes. they're fun none the less and you'll get used to them! I highly recommend this Korean Action MMORPG, to any fan of fast paced combate and unique anime-like graphics.			"

												I haven't been playing long so if you need to decide if you are going to get this game, look to a review from someone who has spent at least 30 hrs in game.I am here to share my first impressions. I'll start with the bad: the game is very cookie cutter, story line, level grind, being usless untill level 20, and so on. I have also seen better graphics, WAY BETTER. The game also feels frustratingly easy, but takes a long  time. It's like every other F2P MMO out there. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!Now for the good stuff; the game is adorable, the npc's have funny personalities, It's quick to understand, and really fun, almost relaxing. But what is really unique about this game is the community. I was playing for the first time trying to figure out what to do and bam, in the first FIVE minutes I met three people (all higher level than me) just hanging around, who invited me to their party. Two minutes later they where going on all my quests with me and showing me what to do. They helped me until I reached lvl 10 when I had to get off and catch some sleep. We have keept in touch since then but it's really cool how I met them so soon and how friendly they where, I'm used to playing games where nearly everyone is ""lone wolf"" kinda thing but It's really nice to have people to party up with and just hang out.I'm keeping this short and sweet so overall first impression is: I'm No longer forever alone. This game is fun, have some paitience, give it a try :P.			"

												This is a fun game, its made by the same company who published Vindictus, the graphics are great, the battle system is good, each class has one thing or person they have to protect or save.  But you can choose from 4 classes, each with their own unique abilities and strengths. So if you want a fun MMORPG, you should download this game and try it. Character design is pretty cool, the enemies can be a tad bit difficult, but hey what do you expect? for the enemies to stay at an easy level? lol, whats the fun in that , seriously.... But all in all you shoudl try this game, if you like MMORPG's. The only thing i dont like about this, well is that its llike Vindictus, meaning that you cant really free roam in this game, but oh well. Its a very good game if you like the MMORPG style like Vindictus, its very fun, and you can lose countless hours in it and not even realising it			"

												I highly recommend that you should give this game a solid try if you haven't already. By solid try, I mean to level a character past 15 and the first specialization because, as other reviews may have noted, it's a bit of a slow starter. Your character starts off fairly weak with few impressive skills. However, that just makes the payoff that much more satisfying later when you decimate about thirty goblins in a single blow. With very few exceptions, most of the skills in this game are AoEs with no upper limit of affected targets and no reduced damage for the number of targets affected. This lends to an almost addictive feeling of raw, unadulterated power.But let's focus on what I really like about this game.This game just oozes charm. Though the graphics are not what one would expect from a top-of-the-line blockbuster, the animations are fluid to the point that one can suspend disbelief and immerse themselves in the world of Altera. This is further supplemented by the voice acting. Although I'm not a huge fan of the voice acting for the playable characters themselves, and voice acting in the cutscenes is to be expected, I've sort of fallen in love with how the NPCs are voiced. It's nothing too elaborate; each NPC has a couple of different canned lines for when you initiate a conversation with them, and a couple for when you part ways. However, they really help to bring the setting to life, especially in tandem with the humorous and well-written dialogue for the quests themselves. I often found myself re-reading the quest dialogues for quests I'd done a dozen times already, simply because I found them that funny. The story itself has plenty of twists and turns, and I always found myself wanting to charge down the main quest line just to know what happened next.I'm also a big fan of the game's mechanics. I've played games which implemented the public-instanced-town with privately-instanced-dungeons mechanic, and games which implemented the third-person shooter perspective. This one does both, and fairly well. I'm generally a fan of soloing the majority of game content, and the regular dungeons are solo-friendly. Combat is smooth, interweaving regular mouse-button attacks with hotkeyed skills so that one is rarely just spamming skills and waiting for cooldowns to reset. Gear is relatively easy to come by (though less so with the more classes added, sadly)(EDIT: They fixed that issue, as gear drops in boxes that give you a class-specific item when you open them.), as soloing Master difficulty is fairly easy and one can get ""magic"" green-quality gear from Master instances. Upgrading ""magic"" gear to +6 (+7 or more if you find extras that you can competitively upgrade until one breaks) is pretty darn cheap and gives you more than enough stats to get you through soloing abyss dungeons on pretty much any class, so I would recommend not bothering with blue or orange gear until you're near endgame and really need the stats for harder dungeons, Nests, and PvP.There are limitations, of course. The classes are gender-locked, and though you can customize your character's appearance to an extent, each of them is essentially their own pre-made character with its own story. It may also be difficult for a newer player/character to find others to level with, but joining a guild (or even just staying in the newbie guild you're automatically inserted into when your character is made) may remedy this issue.All in all, I've put a lot of hours into this game and always find myself coming out for more. Maybe it's not your thing, but I'd recommend giving it a try, anyway.			"

												While you oft run into long periods of grinding (Especially 60+), and the updates are few and far between, I find this game fairly fun. It has pretty good replayability, given the multiple classes, as well as a pretty good story for each class. It does have it's faults, though. The most glaring of which is the lack of anything to do at the level cap (which has steadily risen since I started playing this game). At level 60+, your options are essentially limited to grinding and Nests. And did I mention that the level 60 nests are impossible to do alone?Note: This review is based on possibly old experience, although I doubt it, given how little this game is updated.			"

The graphics are a cartoonish style, which is fine and works for me really. Unless your not a fan of cartoon style it shouldn't bother you.One thing I kind of dislike about the game is the lack of customization, you can't even change your gender, each class is set to a specific gender, which is kind of disappointing as I really like customization on characters. There is very little of that in this game however. But it doesn't make the game bad or anything.The dungeons are kind of easy at first, but get pretty tough pretty steadily, before long you won't be able to do every dungeon on master difficulty with ease, and you will need to turn the difficulty lower, or get a few friends to help.Each time you enter a Dungeon you can select a difficulty, which affects how much XP you get and other rewards. And the dungeons can get challanging like I said, even if the first couple aren't especially with friends. But overall the game is pretty fun I find, especially with a buddy or two. Its a fresh nice MMO which I find enjoyable as you bash through tons of enemies alone or with your friends. And aquire juicy loot and cool spells.And the fact its free means I think you should atleast try it if you get the chance.			"

												I've recently gone over my review and noticed it was... rather plain, and didn't give any indication as to the actualy quality of this game, so allow me to elaborate. Dragon Nest is an Action RPG made by Nexon and, what I would call, like Vindictus' younger brother. The combat is very involved as compared to other MMORPG's and skills are very satisfying to use. All-in-all, I would say Dragon Nest is a very fun MMORPG and if you like Vindictus, you will most likely enjoy this game.Pros:- Cutesy Anime Style (Maybe a con if you're not into that?)- Runs fairly well- Satisfying/Solid Combat- Straight-forward and easy to understand- Not Pay-to-win (Last I checked anyway...)- Has the general quality one can expect from a Nexon game- Panty ShotsCons:- Progress slows down rather significantly around level 40 (Cap is like 80, I think?)- Difficult to gear-up later on- PvP is incredibly brokenThe bottom line is, I haven't really had any bad experiences with Dragon Nest, and it's F2P, so why not give it a try?

												This game is blood boilingly exciting, the combat is challenging at times, but is extremely fun. I play with my best friend and we have fun clearing the dungeons on the harder difficulties. I love experimenting with each class. (can't wait for the assassin!) I also enjoy the contrast between the character looks and the monster looks. It goes from ""oh, that's nice."" to ""Oh GOD oh, what the hell IS that thing... THAT'S AN ORC??!! I've never seen an orc like that before. Who designed these monstrosities??!! WTF is goin on????"" I love every bit of this game and I'll spend endless hours playing it in the future. Take note NOT to be discourged because of the gender-locked classes. they're fun none the less and you'll get used to them! I highly recommend this Korean Action MMORPG, to any fan of fast paced combate and unique anime-like graphics.			"

												I highly recommend this game but DO NOT download the STEAM VERSION. Go to Nexon's official website at http://dragonnest.nexon.net/ and download their client instead. The steam version is regularly plagued by log-in and patching issues and the only fix is to re-download the game every single time. Nexon and Steam doesn't seem to care about this version anymore.Now, on to the review! If you want action-oriented MMORPG with flashy / cool-looking moves then Dragon Nest is the game for you. You have your basic rpg classes in the form of Warrior, Archer, Cleric and Sorcerer. The other available classes are Tinkerer (a sort of engineer) and Dancer. Upcoming classes are Assassin and Lancer.The world is instance type wherein areas (including towns) are separated like dungeons. Although, the towns are very big themselves. The dungeons get bigger and bigger as you progress into the game. Lastly, the environment details are well made and numerous.You gain exp in the game by killing mobs in dungeons, clearing the dungeons themselves and completing NPC quests. When you gain a level you get skill points which you can use to unlock your skills. Core stats are pre-set by the game. Pretty much a standard level and skill system. There's a nifty feature wherein you can see a demo of a skill first before you get it. That way, you can see if you'll like the skill or not.Exp is very fast from Level 1 to 50. 50 to 70 is when the grind starts but still doable and not boring because of the awesome combat system. If you're a hardcore player that can sit a whole day in front of a computer then you can get to the level cap in a week or so. If you're a casual player like me, at level 50 onwards you can gain 2 levels a day or 4 while still being able to stand up and do other stuff. That's pretty fast by today's MMORPG standards.I won't go into the other details of the game because to be honest, it's very big even though it's instanced type. I just provided feedback on the basic features that players tend to look forward to.So again, if you're into action and flashy moves, this is the game for you. You're not really missing anything by not dowloading the Steam version so go the Nexon website I provided on this review and get their client instead. Trust me, it'll be less hassle in the long run.Nexon Dragon Nest Official Website:http://dragonnest.nexon.net/ "

												I haven't been playing long so if you need to decide if you are going to get this game, look to a review from someone who has spent at least 30 hrs in game.I am here to share my first impressions. I'll start with the bad: the game is very cookie cutter, story line, level grind, being usless untill level 20, and so on. I have also seen better graphics, WAY BETTER. The game also feels frustratingly easy, but takes a long  time. It's like every other F2P MMO out there. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!Now for the good stuff; the game is adorable, the npc's have funny personalities, It's quick to understand, and really fun, almost relaxing. But what is really unique about this game is the community. I was playing for the first time trying to figure out what to do and bam, in the first FIVE minutes I met three people (all higher level than me) just hanging around, who invited me to their party. Two minutes later they where going on all my quests with me and showing me what to do. They helped me until I reached lvl 10 when I had to get off and catch some sleep. We have keept in touch since then but it's really cool how I met them so soon and how friendly they where, I'm used to playing games where nearly everyone is ""lone wolf"" kinda thing but It's really nice to have people to party up with and just hang out.I'm keeping this short and sweet so overall first impression is: I'm No longer forever alone. This game is fun, have some paitience, give it a try :P.			"

												Dragon Nest is and MMO RPG based game set in an great looking world this game delivers alot of action alot of quest and you can have various things to do their is always a guild to join and their is always someone to play with. I have tried running this game on ultra and it looks very good when playing this game I recommend you try running it on normal and up. Also their is a market place system on here so check that out when you get over 1K gold. From a scale on 1-10 I would give this game a 7/10.Dragon Nest may have it's moments such as having lag at some points or your screen may go black from time to time.I recommend this game for people that want to play a cartoon based MMO it is very fun and can be a bit addictive but most of all it's about teaming up and kicking♥♥♥♥♥ The animation in this game is down right and good I love how the senes come up and when their over their's even more action and fighting missions in this game take a while to complete and every year they add up the level max by 10. I am currently a level 56 but the level cap is now 70. In this game you can really play for a very long time and not get board. I think what makes this MMO diffrent from others is the charcters and how they look.+Warrior+Archer+Cleric+KaliAre my top 4 favorite charcters I recommend these guys because they really get the job done they kill Swift and Clean and they are really easy to control. during the begining of the game you are introduced to a wonderful world each character has a diffrent cutsene inn the start of the game. But they all really come together and you won't really realize it. I recommend that you team up with other people at least 2 or 3 but a party of 4 is also good too. When playing Dragon Nest it is always good for your party's characters to be diffrent. Their is no fun in having a party of 4 and all of you guys are warriors. Every character is diffrent and they all have their own special abilities so make a wise choice. When starting out you will be a bit confused so help is always needed your can ask people to train you but they might want you to be a certain level before they begin to help you out. Having a Mentor is always good because they can power level you when you need them the most. Weapons and Armor in this game are really good. The equipment you start out with is ind of crappy but as you progress in this game you will unlock some really good stuff. If you want to get a bit fancy with your Weapons and Armor you can buy soome NX in the game and get and outfits,pets,weapons, and other accesories. This game is really good you should really try it out you will learn how to play right away the customization on here is great and the graphics are really good so check it out and good luck on your travels. Dragon Nest delivers a great set of music when  you are in town and when you are in battle. The bosses in this game can be difficult if you don't know what your doing I give this game a 7/10			"

												A very diverse game with a very smooth feel. The controls make you feel like you are in control of it all. The graphics aren't the greatest in the world, but the motion capture is very smooth to make up for that. The storylines are very unique and complete. The way you level is easier than most games. The end of the class trees are at level 45, unlike the level 70 that most other games have. You don't get bored while playing this game. You have to be alert to what is happening and be a step ahead of everyone else.			"

												First off, I'd like to say that I'm not a huge fan of MMO's, but I do attempt some to see how I like them. And this one I absolutely fell in love with. It's got great gameplay (feels more like 3rd person action than an MMO, which I like) with some awesome abilities you can gain, a pretty good story that actually goes in depth, compared to some other MMO's I've played, and actually has some characters that you grow to care for. Not to mention that the style is very nice, along with the designs of most of the weapons and armor.The ONLY issue I would have to say (but this could be said about other games as well), is that when you get to higher levels, like 45+, you will need to grind so much XP, it can be a bit teadious. But, if you have a group of friends, or can make some new ones on here, then you can go do some nice raids, and high level grinding, and that'll help out a bit. Otherwise, this game is pretty awesome, and I've enjoy every moment I've spent playing it.			"

												Generally I'm not into MMOs because I don't find them engaging. The whole ""point at enemy, push button"" aspect is not appealing to me. However, this MMO is different from what I'm used to seeing from them. This one uses a hack and slash mechanic and is quite fun! I actually can't wait to get my next skill, instead of being generally confused when I learn a new one in other MMOs. This games is generally geared for a younger audience, so there's not much to it intellectually, but the characters and quests are charming and at times extremely funny. The whole game has a generic anime feel to it, but if you like good, clean fun in a pretty environment you can't go wrong here.			"

												To preface about myself, I've been playing this game since beta, and have well over 500 hours logged on this, since the switch to using Steam for Dragon Nest was relatively recent.I have a great time playing this game. It recently got revamped to make leveling from 1-50 easier, although it will still take time. It's definitely possible to finish the story line with just the gear you get from quests, although getting really good gear will definitely take time and in-game currency. While there are people who trade NX for gold and vice versa, this game is most definitely not pay 2 win, but there are many costumes and cosmetic customizations that you can purchase within the NX store. While those cosmetic items do indeed have stats, they're definitely not needed to be well-geared for raids. Class elitism doesn't exist for the most common things, such as nests, although once you start getting into raids and other really tough things to clear, people will definitely have class preferences. That said, it's good to visit the forums on dragonnest.nexon.net and read about different classes, as well as do some googling on what's easiest to gear, what class is cheapest to get good at, etc, before jumping into this game. Most people I've met were extremely friendly, and it's never hard to party up and work with people for nests and quests. Guilds are also awesome in this game. There are many, and different types exist for different players, so everyone from casual to hardcore can find guilds to suit them. The market is also really well done now, and buying/selling is a smooth process.The fighting system is real-time and 3D, which makes for an AWESOME gameplay. It's super fast and has pve and pvp within the game, with reward systems and ability to acquire weapons by doing either. It's not all about stats - your ability to dodge monsters' abilities, other people's abilities, and the whole cartoon animation style is great. The one con that I would mention is that once you get really high level and your power runs out quickly, the game can get somewhat boring unless you have a guild or a group of friends to do raids and nests with. Being purely a solo player is a lonesome and boring life once you hit 70, and grinding does exist for the last 10-15 levels until you hit the cap. Overall I'd rate this game 8.5/10. It's solid,			"

The game will on occasions have a glitch of some sort where you will need to repeat a dungeon (which will take a few minutes at most) to complete a quest. And the world feels linear. Other than that, the graphics are very nice, the combat mechanics are fun, and well it's free to play!7/10			"

												awesome combat, good community, many hours of gameplay, SOOOOO many quests, activly updating, and great multiplayer and single player gameplay quality(although the game gives more perks to people who play with others.) One of my only dislikes is that character customization is very lacking. For instance there are only 2 hair styles for warrior, and no gender options. Aside from that I don't like that most of the women are sexualized to all hell, but if you can get passed that, it's a great game that deserves some attention from action and rpg fans alike.			"

												Dragon Nest is a fun and easy to pick up mmo with both pve and pvp features. Several different classes with several different specializations. What more can you want? Graphically speaking its not as breath taking as more recent things but its good enough for even someone who prefers older graphics over new. The story line changes a bit for each character which makes each new character a different experience. Keep in mind you start off in a random guild so if you want your own gotta talk to the npc first to leave that guild. Also can't delete a character that is part of a guild (even that default guild).

												First off- the most important thing is: the most fun I have had in a game since I was about ~12 (I'm 27, and i'm talking about FF7). The action in this game is... amazing. Fast paced, intense, and above all it's just fun.Also, character progression is great. Each class specs into 2 different tiers, and from there 2 more, etc. This, combined with the fact that you can spend your points on different abilities, means you can have 2 people from the class performing different roles and adds uniqueness (kinda) and flexibility. Each new ability you unlock can be dramatic, and the best part is you can pump points into any of them depending on how you want to play your character. I hate when games have the useful skills and the useless ones, and it's just a no brainer.Unfortuantely (and this may have changed since i last played- let me know if it has) the in-game economy is set to nickel and dime you to death. I played up to level cap (when it was 50). Each new level they give you items to seal your good equip/items (thus allowing you to sell on the player2player market, otherwise your item is tied to your character). But as soon as you reach level cap, you get no more of these. This means, once you are out, as i was, you have to pay a ridiculous price for these seals. I can't remember what the price was, but it was ludicrous. There are free ones you collect in the game, but after playing for hours upon hours (i think my game time was arounf 172 hours?) i blew all of them and got maybe a few to work, if that. The rate of success on these free ones was so low, and the price of the paid ones so high, that it wasn't worth playing anymore because I essentially couldn't make a decent amount of money and i certainly didn't want to ditch my epic gear to an in game store for pennies. I sincerely hope that has changed since i stopped, but i doubt it has. Let me know though if it has, because i would LOVE to pick this game up again.Also, i only dabbled in the PVP, but it was very good from what i played.If this game had an option to buy it outright for a set price ($60? i would pay more even...) and just let you buy and sell freely in the market, maybe with some other options, it would be in my top 10 games ever, imho.All in all, i would highly recommend playing this game- only with the foresight of knowing not to let yourself get addicted, only to have withdrawals when you force yourself off of it at level cap (when things get really interesting). Or maybe even play to level cap, and then start a new character.			"

												For a free game it's surprisingly good. Fast action and varied classes. Lots of quests and dungeons to do, though it does get somewhat stale in higher levels, But PVP is there to make up for it. If you're bored and need something new to play. This should be a nice fix.			"

												How do i describe Dragon Nest...Limited, NOT open world, and long grinds (good times)orBEST combat system, great raids, fair backstory (game not known for it) and...The combat system makes up for everything really. The weapon is only good as the user, and the voice acting is... meh, who cares (not bad, it's something else).Also, remenber it's a Nexon game, so it's not p2w but has the worst gambling system of too much useless prizes			"

												Love this game, its got everything you'd be looking for. Action, Adventure, anime style characters, (some REALLY cute!)  the only downfall is that you have to pay for a larger storage and backpack. It's 4 outta 5 stars on that. Game play and story is 5 stars. Overall rating on the game: 4.8 outta 5 stars. David the whatever he is for the moment is annoying as hell but fun to rescue when he chickens out... on everything. I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes LoL, WoW, and Spiral Knights. It could be the breath of fresh air you're looking for in a game.			"

												First off- the most important thing is: the most fun I have had in a game since I was about ~12 (I'm 27, and i'm talking about FF7). The action in this game is... amazing. Fast paced, intense, and above all it's just fun.Also, character progression is great. Each class specs into 2 different tiers, and from there 2 more, etc. This, combined with the fact that you can spend your points on different abilities, means you can have 2 people from the class performing different roles and adds uniqueness (kinda) and flexibility. Each new ability you unlock can be dramatic, and the best part is you can pump points into any of them depending on how you want to play your character. I hate when games have the useful skills and the useless ones, and it's just a no brainer.Unfortuantely (and this may have changed since i last played- let me know if it has) the in-game economy is set to nickel and dime you to death. I played up to level cap (when it was 50). Each new level they give you items to seal your good equip/items (thus allowing you to sell on the player2player market, otherwise your item is tied to your character). But as soon as you reach level cap, you get no more of these. This means, once you are out, as i was, you have to pay a ridiculous price for these seals. I can't remember what the price was, but it was ludicrous. There are free ones you collect in the game, but after playing for hours upon hours (i think my game time was arounf 172 hours?) i blew all of them and got maybe a few to work, if that. The rate of success on these free ones was so low, and the price of the paid ones so high, that it wasn't worth playing anymore because I essentially couldn't make a decent amount of money and i certainly didn't want to ditch my epic gear to an in game store for pennies. I sincerely hope that has changed since i stopped, but i doubt it has. Let me know though if it has, because i would LOVE to pick this game up again.Also, i only dabbled in the PVP, but it was very good from what i played.If this game had an option to buy it outright for a set price ($60? i would pay more even...) and just let you buy and sell freely in the market, maybe with some other options, it would be in my top 10 games ever, imho.All in all, i would highly recommend playing this game- only with the foresight of knowing not to let yourself get addicted, only to have withdrawals when you force yourself off of it at level cap (when things get really interesting). Or maybe even play to level cap, and then start a new character.			"

												I love this game. Honestly, when I first saw it, I thought it was going to be like all of the other MMORPGs. Basic few classes, leveling, lack of people, and then get bored maybe a week or two into it, but I have been playing for over a year now, and I think it's awesome. There are not only 7 different classes with another on the way to choose from, but each class gets a subclass at level 15, and then it splits yet again into more customization at level 45. There is no lack of players, either. There are multiple channels filled with players in all of the different cities. Party play is fun and the dungeons are expansive. I absolutely recommend this game to the MMO players out there. If you've ever played Vindictus, it has a similiar game-play, but a bit more anime-esque. Try it!			"

												Although this game can have some problems. Mainly with Hack-Shield. Once you get it working, have fun with your addiction. This game is pure fun. I can't get enough. The developers goal was to basically combine console level Hack'n'Slash gameplay with traditional MMORPG features. And it worked. It worked so well. The character customization is a bit lacking, but it is still there. The game is not a money sucker by any means. When they same Free-to-play, they mean free to play. The graphics overall are not the greatest, even on max settings. But as long as you are not a graphics Wh*** you should be fine. But overall, the graphic style is very nice. It's bright-ish Anime inspired graphics are not exactly new to the MMO genre, but overall are nice. I haven't even gotten to the Combat. Oh my, I can not get enough of this gameplay. The combat is absolutely gorgeous. It has your basic left-click attack. Your right click is your special. And then you have your skills, the skills are respectivly on the number keys, which does take a little while to get use to at first. But after awhile it won't be so irritating.The music in this game is also quite beautiful, and works perfectly in the background to build tension. It is no Kingdom Hearts or Elder Scrolls, but it is still quite nice. The composers did a nice job. Gameplay 9.7Sound 8.8Graphics 7.6Replay value 10Overall 8.9/10~RadiantNight7			"

												Fastest combat in a Mmo I""ve ever seen much more like a console hack and slash then an mmo. Only negitive is it is free you play so there are our some insane prices on the in-game stuff.			"

												Really fun game, 9.8/10. The classes are really fun to play with and it keeps you coming back to play more. Every class has its own unique specialty. If you like action mmorpgs, this is also for you. I took off a few points because I don't know if this is just me but some parts of this game really lags. It takes up quite a few space but yeah, overall a good game. #TeamCleric. o3o			"

												First off- the most important thing is: the most fun I have had in a game since I was about ~12 (I'm 27, and i'm talking about FF7). The action in this game is... amazing. Fast paced, intense, and above all it's just fun.Also, character progression is great. Each class specs into 2 different tiers, and from there 2 more, etc. This, combined with the fact that you can spend your points on different abilities, means you can have 2 people from the class performing different roles and adds uniqueness (kinda) and flexibility. Each new ability you unlock can be dramatic, and the best part is you can pump points into any of them depending on how you want to play your character. I hate when games have the useful skills and the useless ones, and it's just a no brainer.Unfortuantely (and this may have changed since i last played- let me know if it has) the in-game economy is set to nickel and dime you to death. I played up to level cap (when it was 50). Each new level they give you items to seal your good equip/items (thus allowing you to sell on the player2player market, otherwise your item is tied to your character). But as soon as you reach level cap, you get no more of these. This means, once you are out, as i was, you have to pay a ridiculous price for these seals. I can't remember what the price was, but it was ludicrous. There are free ones you collect in the game, but after playing for hours upon hours (i think my game time was arounf 172 hours?) i blew all of them and got maybe a few to work, if that. The rate of success on these free ones was so low, and the price of the paid ones so high, that it wasn't worth playing anymore because I essentially couldn't make a decent amount of money and i certainly didn't want to ditch my epic gear to an in game store for pennies. I sincerely hope that has changed since i stopped, but i doubt it has. Let me know though if it has, because i would LOVE to pick this game up again.Also, i only dabbled in the PVP, but it was very good from what i played.If this game had an option to buy it outright for a set price ($60? i would pay more even...) and just let you buy and sell freely in the market, maybe with some other options, it would be in my top 10 games ever, imho.All in all, i would highly recommend playing this game- only with the foresight of knowing not to let yourself get addicted, only to have withdrawals when you force yourself off of it at level cap (when things get really interesting). Or maybe even play to level cap, and then start a new character.			"

												Unlike regular RP games, it actually has it's own story plot. You have a choice to go solo or team up. You also have the choice to do side quests or the main story. Really fun to play. Only down side is the character don't really custimize. All you can do is chose which class you want and the colour of hair and clothes.			"

												For a free game it's surprisingly good. Fast action and varied classes. Lots of quests and dungeons to do, though it does get somewhat stale in higher levels, But PVP is there to make up for it. If you're bored and need something new to play. This should be a nice fix.			"

												This game is basically a more child-friendly World Of Warcraft as I see it, but there's no problem that I have with that. This game is fun, it has nice clean graphics, and each character class gets its own version of the same story, which is a nice twist if you want to start as a new class. The classes are all unique and even have difficulty levels depending on how you like to play the game. This coming from a level 23 Tinkerer, I'm having a lot of fun from this game and it is not tedious to level up, you are not forced to continue the story as it has many side quests, and it's free!Anyone can enjoy this game for many long hours, and it's definitely worth trying out.

												I'm going to say it right now: this game is  VERY  ""grindy."" If you plan on getting the  decent  gear or that top pvp ladder spot you better be ready to grind those dungeons till your eyes bleed. It is very much a grind-to-win game. And is the very standard ""Collect X amounts of stuff"" MMO crap that we have come to enjoy (sarcasm). The story is mediocre at best. Customer support is quite possible one of the worst, as the publisher is Nexon.That being said though, it still has it's great moments. If you just sit back and ignore all of those fancy collectables and pvp lags, you will realize that it can be enjoyable. The skills and classes are very diverse and offer a lot of interesting combos and techniques to play around with in both pvp and pve. The community (for the most part) is friendly and willing to help you if need be. And the variety of enemies the game throws at you keeps pve challenging and engaging.5.5/10 This game barely edges out on my scale. Do not play this game unless you like running the same dungeon repeatedly because you will not like it. However, if you are truly just in it for the experience and not the competitiveness, it can still be an entertaining game.			"

												Dragon NestImmediately the art style drew me to this game, so I tried it out. Dragon Nest has a wide variety of classes, each with stats that resemble that class which makes realistic gameplay. It also has a great levelling system, quest system, inventory and arena systems, alongside guilds, as well as parties with fair loot drops for its members. The varied weapons, gear and other items always gives you incentive to keep playing. With its fast action 3rd person gameplay, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes fast paced MMORPG's. This game breaks away from the top down MMO’s and does it well. Overall an amazing game for the solo player or the team player. "

												Dragon Nest combat is really engaging and intense. It's what I love most of the game. The storyline is quite interesting, if I do say so myself. All the classes have a unique playstyle and none seem reminiscent of the others.The few things I was not fond of, however, is the lack of character custimization, little to no social interaction ( I have yet to make an in-game friend. Most of the friends I have I met on forums), and the repetitive dungeons. However, the combat style more than makes up for this!			"

												Game is very entertaining, many choices for skill builds for each character. Many many costume combos or sets. Armor doesnt look drab they put effort in its design along with the graphics. Now mind you like all mmorpgs there is quite abit of lag espically in Saints haven(lv 24-40 town). Word of warning try not to use market place in that town. area is lag central. Other than lag game will gives hours and hours of game play and if you need a guild Pm Syri or search Jellyfish. We'll help you out.			"

												this game is quite imersive, with the combat changing depending on in air or not and attacks working off of arial launces are a interesting factor. the talent system is fairly reasonable, and the combat really takes you away from the mmo's typical tab target system. its a welcome change. it would use some more texture re vamping and better lightning systems, and maybe a gor feature for people who like the whole anime style but want a more graphic exsperiance. and perhaps linking all of the gate way maps together so you dont have to suffer loading screams all the time.other then thies small details the games build is quite solid. and has a high potental.

												Amazing action MMO that delivers quite a bit of content. Starter classes branch into more elaborate and specialized paths that only enhance the enjoyment of the game. Although the game is based around instances/dungeons, the action and varied monsters make up for the lack of an open world. Can't seem to find any other game that deliver the same action as this game. The cutesy anime graphics may put off some potential players, but for those who do not mind the anime-like graphics will find this game enjoyable. Dungeons/instances are always more fun with friends, but solo play is still pretty fun to play through. A very recommended game for those who seek a true action MMO. ^_^			"

												I'm going to say it right now: this game is  VERY  ""grindy."" If you plan on getting the  decent  gear or that top pvp ladder spot you better be ready to grind those dungeons till your eyes bleed. It is very much a grind-to-win game. And is the very standard ""Collect X amounts of stuff"" MMO crap that we have come to enjoy (sarcasm). The story is mediocre at best. Customer support is quite possible one of the worst, as the publisher is Nexon.That being said though, it still has it's great moments. If you just sit back and ignore all of those fancy collectables and pvp lags, you will realize that it can be enjoyable. The skills and classes are very diverse and offer a lot of interesting combos and techniques to play around with in both pvp and pve. The community (for the most part) is friendly and willing to help you if need be. And the variety of enemies the game throws at you keeps pve challenging and engaging.5.5/10 This game barely edges out on my scale. Do not play this game unless you like running the same dungeon repeatedly because you will not like it. However, if you are truly just in it for the experience and not the competitiveness, it can still be an entertaining game.			"

												Dragon NestImmediately the art style drew me to this game, so I tried it out. Dragon Nest has a wide variety of classes, each with stats that resemble that class which makes realistic gameplay. It also has a great levelling system, quest system, inventory and arena systems, alongside guilds, as well as parties with fair loot drops for its members. The varied weapons, gear and other items always gives you incentive to keep playing. With its fast action 3rd person gameplay, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes fast paced MMORPG's. This game breaks away from the top down MMO’s and does it well. Overall an amazing game for the solo player or the team player. "

Many people say this game is awesome but its actually trash when all you can do is hit stuff in the same dungeon for 100 levels in a row and people seem to think thats entertaining.			"

												This MMORPG is absolutely addicting!! It is pretty fast paced and action packed to the gills, some drawbacks to the game that Ive had are those pesky SPEED HACKS... I would be in the middle of a dungeon then all of a sudden I get kicked from the game... Atleast I am a patient person so I boot it back up when it happens, so its not a big deal for me. I havent been big on PVP on any game but I decided to have a go with it, it seems that in order to have a good PVP match, you have to be at a high level such as lvl 60... when I first became lvl 24 and was able to get to Saints Haven I tried the PVP, I couldnt find a single person at my lvl to pvp with, it was kind of a let down on that part. The customization is lacking quite a bit, all of the characters are gender locked, so if you want a female warrior then you are out of luck. On the plus side of things, I managed to use a handeld gamepad for this game and it managed to work pretty well, although it lacks the ability to hold more spells and skills than the game allows. The graphics are quite pleasing, and the sound is fun!! I highly recommend this game to anybody who likes fast paced mmorpg's!!			"

												Great MMORPG. For me, it was my first experience with a game like this. Mainly because it was 3D. :3 Don't judge me. Anyways, it was a beautiful game with fast and stylish combat as well as vivid characters and decent humour. I suggest you give it a try until the end. The main problems for me when playing is that, the game is quite slow and tedious. At the beginning, of course this shows the most but as you progress through, entering each area and doing each quest was indeed slow. It was worthwhile though because you were awarded with rewards. I still recommend this game for all ages. I have friends playing this game from as young as 10 to 30 xD. 8.5/10 Great combat and story. "

The only way i could see it get boring is if you are soloing dungeons alone. The storyline is great so if you're a fan of that stuff you could always do that. Lacks alittle bit of customization being that you need to spend money to buy cosmetics but for a free to play i can't say that's bad. I recommend. 4.5/5.			"

One of the few free to play games where you don't get stuck until you spend money in the online store. Without spending a penny you have access to the full game. This game is highly recommended for people who have become jaded with the standard World of Warcraft clones out there. You can actually make real progress playing an hour at a time instead of having to organize a raid that takes 8-10 hours of nonstop game play. Even the largest dungeon takes an hour or less.			"

												This game is so bad. All you do is jump around pressing numbers and aiming at dumb stuff like bats. The charaacters are dumb to because you do quests that are obviously very easy to complete. this game has no challenge to it. Many people say this game is awesome but its actually trash when all you can do is hit stuff in the same dungeon for 100 levels in a row and people seem to think thats entertaining.			"

												This MMORPG is absolutely addicting!! It is pretty fast paced and action packed to the gills, some drawbacks to the game that Ive had are those pesky SPEED HACKS... I would be in the middle of a dungeon then all of a sudden I get kicked from the game... Atleast I am a patient person so I boot it back up when it happens, so its not a big deal for me. I havent been big on PVP on any game but I decided to have a go with it, it seems that in order to have a good PVP match, you have to be at a high level such as lvl 60... when I first became lvl 24 and was able to get to Saints Haven I tried the PVP, I couldnt find a single person at my lvl to pvp with, it was kind of a let down on that part. The customization is lacking quite a bit, all of the characters are gender locked, so if you want a female warrior then you are out of luck. On the plus side of things, I managed to use a handeld gamepad for this game and it managed to work pretty well, although it lacks the ability to hold more spells and skills than the game allows. The graphics are quite pleasing, and the sound is fun!! I highly recommend this game to anybody who likes fast paced mmorpg's!!			"

												As I recall this game it's one of the best games I havent played in a long time. I was a beta tester I just search up fast paced games and then I found this. It was amazing but after you keep lvling up ( right now im'a lv 62 cause of me changing my computer to a custom one which cost a lot of money) it gets hard to lvl up. But still it's a game that people will not expect. It's completely 'free' so no memebership which was a blessing. I would feel sorry if anyone had a mac and could'nt play this game. character Name: Jakecools add me if need tips.			"

												Fun and intense, true free fighting Dragon Nest is one of my favorite MMO's that are free to play. Its diverse fighting is one of the best little features in the game. Anime style graphics make this game look great. When your fighting you will definatley feel like you are breaking the earth. Only setbacks of this game is it is gender locked and that there isnt very much character customization. Sooner or later though NA (North America) will get more classes such as the Assassin which is Dragon Nests' biggest project at the minute. The Assassin is only available in its birth place, Korea, and is based on what his name is, an assassin. Very good game, despite those bad features the game looks great and is very fun and addicting.			"

												Very fun game with a decent storyline. Had hours of fun staying up late with a friend online, destroying enemies with the MMO's fluid combat system and teaming up with random players. Fun experience overall while with friends or some random player. Community is generally friendly, and reading the world chat offers up some good laughs or WTF moments from time to time. I would recommend to any of my friends as it is F2P and you aren't limited by the need to pay unless you REALLY suck at the game.			"

												Action packed RPG with tonnes of nuianced, creative, and just plain fun game play.  Beautiful in game art and cutscenes.  Some of the best writing, storylines, and NPC character development I have seen in forever. Immense in scope and pursuable quests. Clever crafting, character building, market system, and social interaction. Dragon Nest is an easter egg on Steam that it seems few people know about and part of me doesnt want to share, but the people who make this game possible should have their coffers lined with gold for such a well made excellently written and enjoyable game. Suggestion:1. Don't be afraid of challenging and even angering some players with impossible to beat quests.Abyss difficulty at any character level of play should be nigh impossible without a team no matter how good you, equipment, and teammates are. Inscrutable difficulty wins respect, is the best pr, and get the most diehard loyal fans which this truly great game deserves in spades.Likers Like. Haters gonna hate. Gamers, play this game and you will have fun. "

												Another online game by Nexon that is similar to Vindictus, but definately different.  Dragon Nest has a bit more of an RPG feel to it than Vindictus. The control is a bit different and resembles more like a mix of Vindictus and Guild Wars 2. However like other free online RPGs, its not really MMO, and its not very open world.  Missions are fun, but NPCs make you do them over and over. 4 character classes to choose from (again gender locked), Fighter(Male), Cleric,(Male) Archer(Elf fFemale), and sorceress (Female).  At upper levels you get class changes and take different class specializations.  Lots of fun, but you will tire of it if you play too much.			"

												Action MMO that does so much perfectly. Where I live (US) the game feels fluid, no lag, no delay on when I press a move do I see my character reacting. This feeling is so importnant and most games fail to deliver on this. The game is a little micro transaction heavy. Simple things that should be free or earned (like inv space, respecs) are pay for. Also costume items have stats so while they aren't make or break good, they do give a serious boost when added up. One other thing that could be considered bad is some of the best stuff (like big wings that make you run faster) can only be obtained via ""Dragon Eggs"" which are pay for booster packs that contain a random item. This makes it very cool when you get something but also makes you hesitate to buy an egg, becuase it could be a whammy. Overall the gameplay is awesome, story is very random and anime-like. Lots of fun even if you stay away from the pay shop.			"

												Heavily stylized, varried gameplay, visually interesting enemies, action-rpg elements, and a system that allows for the building of 'relationships' with NPC's and their factions through an NPC gifting system*, knowledgable and friendly community - What more could you want from an Action-RPG MMO? If you want more 'realism' in your art style check Vindictus - themeatically similar elements and familiar Action-RPG gameplay.Accessable, Free to Play, less of a grind and more of a light hearted good time.If the art style is the only thing stoping you from checking it out - to each their own. Check out Vindictus instead, another F2P light hearted title from the same publisher. *The NPC/Faction/Renown gifting system is incredibly grindy, the gifts are relatively common drops but you need hundreds upon hundreds to make an impact.

												I'm not going to pretend i went into this game with high expectations because...I Didn't. ""oh another mmorpg free to play you say? sounds lovely mate lets break open a whine bottle and have a glass of that. Yeah no. This game is for a better lack of a word...ugly. Anime chicks that look like they belong to a loli magazine in the basement of some internet dude's fap stack of mag turned me off right away at the character creator (oO). TBH it looked like a game from the concept art of a cross between FF and something from Perfect world. Why cant i make a grown man, actually scratch that with a grown man with all these little girls you'd be pretty quick to realize what i did...this game is coy as hell.Take it or leave it i say and if you like little girls running around with their skirts held high enough to make you scree then its your cup of tea but for me it makes me...*HURK*...sorry ill pass.

												This is unlike any other MMO that is currently on the market. It features crazy fast, arcade-like action mixed with the strategy and planning of an MMO. It has a very engaging story that makes your decisions in quests feel like they matter with great humor scattered throughout the whole thing.In addition to this, all of the content is free. You don't have to buy your levels or your raids, you only buy cosmetic items. And while those cosmetics offer special bonuses for characters which are helpful, they don't impact the game in such a way that it turns it into ""pay to win"". Would play with friends.Would play solo.Would recomend for anyone.			"

												So far, I love this game! The classes are all quite unique both in skills and in personality, with each class having their own specializations that change up their playstyles even further. The community, as I've experienced it, has been mostly nice, though you shouldn't expect people to be always there to party up for something. Dungeons, which are your main way of leveling up alongside quests, can get repetetive since there are only around ~3-4 in each area, with each one having ~4-5 different areas inside. Quests, if you actually read into them instead of spamming the space bar to skip the dialogue, generally have a great amount of personality to them, with many, many puns and jokes and such involved in many! Overall, I'd recommend playing this game with friends since it enhances just about everything you do.			"

												Dragon Nest is Asian made action targeting MMORPG that is free to play.Cons: -The classes are gender locked and no customization.  -The avatar artwork is asian style munchkins.-The graphics are outdated.Personally, i was Not impressed with the game enough to play more.  Need to get back to playing my games that i have paid for like LOTRO, STO, DDO, and SWTOR.  I am sure someone might like this game, give it a try.Play Style/Game Playfull control of the players movement using the keys ""W, A, S, D"".  Skills using the short cut keys ""1-10"".  Dragon nest consists of 2 game modes or 2 of both, PvP and PvE. You start off as PvE but later through the levels you can change to PvP or do both. The game consists of 8 Characters as Classes of which they have their own unique skills and abilities. Classes have 'specialization' where they can change into their first and second job and focus on that particular area of combat. Specialization are granted at level 15 and level 44. The 8 classes include:WarriorArcherClericSorceress TinkererKaliAssassinLancerFor more information of the classes and what specialisations they have go to the Nexon website @ http://dragonnest.nexon.net/guides/class-guide  for more info:

												This hit hit the spot four years ago when I was looking for a non targeting action brawler with an archer class.. Recently trying new games that might be like it and ended up getting back into this again.  It's a great game and I've only really gotten about half way through the story and the side quests are endless.  As for people complaining it's too easy and you level up too quick, you can be a level 93 and still have lower level gear to make lower level missions more difficult.  Kind of a dumb complaint.  Honestly great game for free and it can totally be played at your own pace, leveling and crafting gear can be addicting so it's tough to have self control if you want to play levels with level appropriate gear..  This is probably one of the first games I reviewed so It's really good imo.			"

												I honestly only played for about 20 minutes. The gameplay seemed fun in the first ""dungeon."" but overall I can't see myself playing a game in the long run that is instance based. I mean the towns you can see players by joining different channels etc, but to actually participate with others in quests and what-not you have to party with them. That just takes too much out of an MMORPG for me. In my opinion it's actually NOT an MMO. Otherwise every game on xbox live where you can make a lobby and play with 5 people is an MMO as well, IE call of duty, Halo, basically every game out there.			"

												It is your standard MMO. Nothing unique or outstanding of it. However, the servers are severely poor and very laggy. At one point, my entire party disconnected due to the server lag. Also, during a dungeon run, I lagged so terribly, I was literally hitting nothing. Of course, I was getting hit. So much that I died due to the lag. I do not suggest anyone playing this. It is a waste of time, effort, and will only instill frustration.			"

												I miss the good ol' days, when PVP was fun, PvE was grindy, and communities were made. I've followed this game for awhile now with +4000 hrs logged in (favored the launcher over steam) and i'm pretty bummed about the route this game went. One hit bossess and mobs all the way till cap in PvE, PvP is pretty dead now, and so is alot of the towns. Mostly just vets and idles lookin for them ever so juicy likes. This game will always have a great place in my heart, and wallet. Here's to hoping MapleStory 2 comes to us Westerners and that its not♥♥♥♥♥♥on like this. I'd reccommend if we could go back about 3 or so years...how the time flies...			"

												Just another awful F2P Korean MMO clone of a clone of a clone.  The graphics are on par with PS2 B-grade titles, but the game still stutters like crazy due to the Tera / Zelda style realtime action combat.  The worst part of the game are the zones.  They're as big as a closet and you're required to battle about ~25 enemies at once.  There is no room to manuever or do anything other than spam buttons ala God of War.  While you hit one enemy there are three flanking you from the sides and rear.  It feels like a single player game instead of an MMO because up to level 10 I saw maybe two other players the entire night.  The quests are lame and non inspiring with awful translations of the original ""humor,"" just like every other crappy Korean mass produced MMO.  For a newbie to MMOs it might not be not bad, but anyone that's played an RPG or MMO that wasn't made over 10 years ago on a modern computer will just roll their eyes and uninstall after 15 minutes.

												Dragon Nest is an amazing interactive online action mmo. The combat system is along the lines of Kingdoms of Amalur (with flashier skills) with a 4 player Co-op dungeon system added into it. It also has a branching job advancement system where you choose your path of skill development depending on your preferences. The game started with 4 classes: Warrior, Mage, Archer, and Priest, Since the 2 more classes have been added: Alchemist and Dancer. The Thief/Assassin is currently in Korea and on its way to the US soon. I'm sure more classes will be available for years to come. I suggest you watch this video ""

												Pretty nifty game for people who are a fan of fast-paced combat but it's action-based kinda of system that not most people are accustomed to but, if you got the patience to learn something new then you would love this game. The sceneries and graphics are pretty awesome and would require a good computer unless you can stand the lags because believe me, the graphics are NOT dated :P The classes are gender-locked unfortunately and there's more female classes with males having so few. 2 new classes were added since last time I played and it's fun! Tinkerer and Kali. Check it out! :)			"

												Dragon nest is a pretty damn solid game. Before you say I haven't played it, I've played 200+ hours from their website, not through steam.The combat system is excellent, It's modestly free to play, (the one exception is mounts, it's like 40$ for a chance to get one, but mounts have miniscule use. Trust me.) Dragon nest is an extremely immersive game. The classes are all very fun, and pretty balanced. The only downside is, content updates are rare, being a asian game, we get patches 1/2 YEARS later. Important things to note about dragon nest.The entire game is balanced around PvE, this doesn't mean the PvP is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it's not as good as it could be. Most classes are way stronger in PvP then PvE (namely Kali.). The PvE is 100% instance based. Not once will you find a mob that isn't in an instance. My honest opinion ratings:Combat (overall): 9.5/10PvE: 9/10PvP: 8/10P2W (pay to win 1 being very much so, 10 being not at all): 8/10Graphically: 5/10 (the game really lacks in this. The ♥♥♥♥♥iest of laptops can run this game fine.)Overall: 8/10Bottom line is, this game should not be overlooked. Download this game, and you won't regret it.			"

												Currently playing this game for 4-5 years now.Combat is amazing, one of the best I've seen from MMOs.Music is pretty good & storyline is okay but you'll most likely not get into it at all when you play the game as its not a big factor in gameplay. (You can literally grind your way to level cap without doing storyline/side quests).In my opinion, any content but raiding is pretty boring in the game.. but some people may enjoy the PvP.Also the community in NA is pretty horrible if you visit their forums but as every MMO has horrible people, there's amazing people too.I wouldn't recommend this game unless you have lots of free time on your hands, connections or lots of money to spend.

												Lets face it we all hate nexons customer service, but they do make some great titles games that grip you. COming from vindictus this game seem like a childs game but in the long run has great pvp system. The controls are very responsive and has great comabt mechanics. The community is very helpful and enjoys running things together. Raids are a challange and you can find yourself face down in the dirt real quick. If you are a fan of any action mmo then you should try out dragon nest. They have introduced the new assassin class which is super bad♥♥♥♥♥ you want crazy dps all I have to say is shinobi.Pros: great community, awesome pve, great mechanics and great anime style graphics, Dont need a top end pc, crazy good pvp including more then one pvp mode, not an over priced store.Cons: Grind fest which can lead to a headache, nexon customer service(have better luck in forums). SInce it is free to play there are outfits which boost stats (they do have free offers to do for currency), so you can consider this slighty pay to win( in pvp) but i have seen people whip♥♥♥♥♥a free to play. Combos have a slight learning curve which can lead to frustration when pvping against a temptest who knwos roation are any class for that matter.			"

												Dragon Nest is an exciting, action-packed combat game. In the beginning, it starts out slow but as you continue and in the game and start gaining new skills, the term ""fast-paced"" comes true and you'll be creating long combos and defeating enemies in no time. Although the character customizing is a bit small and not many options, this is great for anybody who wants to play a fun MMORPG without needing to use money to make the experience better.			"

												This is one, if not, the best of all of the MMORPGS I have every played, and have had the pleasure to experience.  The storyline is amazing, and keeps you wanting to read most of the dialogue the characters have to offer, the many landscapes look beautiful, even with the old-school type graphics this game harbours. And, finally, the gameplay. It is the best aspect of this game so far, and it's what makes this game different from other MMORPGS. You feel like you're actually controlling your character; it isn't the same 'point and click' formula which has, unfortunately, taken control of most other MMORPGs of the era. Above all else, this game manages to be a unique, excellent experience which I am sure that you will all treasure.			"

												A fun action MMO with a colorful look, a sense of humor, and a lot to keep you coming back for more.  It's geniunely plain entertaining, and pretty easy to get into, letting you enjoy the game without trying to sort out too much arcana or data dumps.  Game progression is also logical, so there's always something new to try out.  Stylistically the cartoony nature keeps it light, though there are elements of odd fanservice, seriousness, and irreverance that don't quite gel and seem odd.  However that's no reason not play what is honestly a good, fun, and rather precise game, wether you want to melt foes with fire, smash them with a sword, or just release a mechanical butler and a legion of roboducks.

												I love this game, it's probaly the best MMO I have ever played, the new Assassin class has an amazing story.The combat is great, the skills look amazing. The story is either great or bad depending on which class you pick. You will have to grind for a solid amount of time everyone once and awhile but overall, amazing game.			"

												Personal opnion: This game is very good but at some point repetetive. There is some hilarious parts in this and it has potential to be very good. I recommend to play this with friends or you might be bored is a couple minutes unless your used to lonly repetetiveness. after a while this game feels boring so i suggest playing this when your bored. The download time is pretty good for a game with this type of stuff in it. In all i  i belive that this game gets a 7.5/10. its fine if you dont agree with my opinion we all have are opinion.Graphics: Graphics are just fine some times there dull and feel ok-ish but its good graphics. The graphics are fine if you dont mind them personally i dont mind them. At the same time thee graphics are AWESOME it has some detail but compared to other pc games in 2012 its about a fair-ish judgment atleast for my standards.Gameplay: The Gameplay is fairly simple as for a mmo rpg with your types of skills and how you build your character.Theres not to much about leveling up and skills its kinda like all rpg skill stuff. As if it comes to customisations to your character there goes the something about this game i dont like because once you have made your character the only thing that changes about it is you characters weapon and thats it no armor change when you put on different armor this dosent bug me too much. as for the fighting machanics this is very simple to acomplish as all of it is going in worlds fighting by clicking and activating your skills by pressing 1 2 3 and etc. In this game the many levels you play have difficultly and thats your choice on which you choose which is good i like a challenge some times. As for other gameplay aspects i did not cover i think the gameplay could be improved a slight bit.Music: As for music there are some music to comfort you as you roam around fighting in each level and the city. Theres not to much to talk about music as when you play this game your more likely to ignore it as for playing while listenning but still the music was a nice feature so you dont get bored :3. I honestly found the music as for trying to listen to it its ok to take a while to stop and listen and relax....And here is the end of the worst review in the world i bet no one will read this and etc cya.

												Love the game other than the storyline. Pretty much run around towns trying to find Rose, supposedly a girl who has the power of the ""Ancients. ""Also can lead into a grinding fest if you don't reach the level requirement of a quest, then your only hope is to do plenty of sidequests. Mainly the quest that will have you grind is going to Saint's Haven which requires you to have a level of 25 I believe, I can't remember. The combat system is really fun and doesn't get as repetitive as most games do. But a dissapoint in gender-locked classes. Most classes in this game you would see in any other MMORPG excluding Kali, don't bash me about tinkerer because it's pretty much a ranged shooting class.Downside is the community support, which I'm pretty sure we're not surprised because it was developed by Nexon.Over all, I find this game pretty fun and you can get into quite easily. But I don't encourage you to spend actual money to buy stuff off the website.8.5/10			"

												tldr:  Not a bad game.  But not the kind of game I will spend time in.I did nto get far.  At all.  Between the cutesy art and giant boobs, or the rediculously basic tutorial, I can see that the game is not meant for me, a 30+ year old gamer who wants to be challanged and have skilled paly rewarded.What thres me off the game:  Extremely limited range, on ""Ranged"" characters.  Also, (might be chagable, I did not attempt to fix) the camera aims your spells/attacks.  Meanig you have to look at the badguy you want to hit.  Not a bad thign right?  Except it meant it I was constantly shooting at things feet because I did wanted to keepa  good veiw of the game as well.  But you effectively have to choose between aiming and seeing from a decent angle.You start out weak I get that.  I'm sure the game gets better.  That's the nature of MMO's.  For all I know 5 minutes further down the road it gets less bland,   But the beginning skills for the 4 classes I tried, were rediculously boring and uninspired conpared to the very interesting skill videos showed off at character creation.  And I don't want another ""grind through the boring ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in hopes of to getting to the good stuff"" game.  I have enough other games that are fun from the get go to choose from.Not a bad game, but no pull to entice the player past the tutorial that teaches you how to push the spacebar.  But it just gives no reason to play it over other games.			"

												Dragon Nest:  Much like the latest Folger's commercial, Dragon Nest doesn't seek to surpass the typical MMO, it looks to land right where every single other one has already innovated, and in most cases, the others have done so in much more engaging and profound ways.  In fact, Dragon Nest doesn't tread any new ground what-so-ever.Prepare for another... Umm... Adventure?  Dragon Nest features a tired storyline that never engages the player, character classes and progressions you've seen for the last decade (or two), an uninspired crafting and upgrade system that's been done to death by every j/k-RPG on the market, and an overpriced cash shop that attempts to lure you in with functions that remove many of the, simply put, intentional annoyances of trying to play the game, such as pitifully limited inventory space and automatic loot pickups.Gameplay is nearly completely combat-based, with drawn-out town segments featuring quest gathering and loot selling.  Combat fails to innovate; expect keyboard gymnastics and mouse-flinging typical of this genre, often interrupted by loading screens every few minutes.  Seriously... The loading screens destroy any immersion to be had here.I would dare to say that the game features some unique artwork and a handful of beautifully modelled monsters and characters, but most of the game centers around scantily-clad female characters (because that's what appeals to the typical gamer, right guys?) which you are introduced to immediately during the game's first loading screen, and 'emo' androgenous males that have left their ""provocative"" stink on every RPG from the east since Square-Enix.Music and sound effects are nothing worth mentioning; I was mostly annoyed by the droning music clips that are featured and muted it within an hour of my playtime.  Sound effects are cartoonish and repetitive, and their lack of variety becomes painfully apparent during combat.  It should be no surprise that the voice acting featured in the game is top-notch, cream-of the-crop, steaming garbage-on-a-hot-summer-day that always sounds completely out of context; how these voice actors are cast or maintain careers is completely lost on me.The story begins with you being some ho-hum walking randomly through the wilderness, and two little girls are attacked by orcs, one being some oracle that you're desperately trying to save for eons, yet every single time you get close, you feel like you should see ""Sorry Mario, but the princess is being held in another castle!""  Oh, and there are evil dragons, apparently.  Most NPC dialogue seems to assume you know what's going on in this world, but the game doesn't ever make an earnest attempt at introducing any of the lore to you so that you know what the hell is going on.Overall, Dragon Nest is a mediocre game; it doesn't innovate in any area, and it's formula is tried and true.  It may be free-to-play, but it makes every possible attempt to make you open your wallet to essentially unbreak itself.  Being a Nexon game, expect their lovely gem 'HackShield' to break and crash your game on a near-hourly basis, often throwing false-positives or simply having some kind of failure that will cause you to lose your progress mid-dungeon.  3 / 10			"

												It's an action rpg game with short instances that you can play with friends. Pros: - Different classes to choose from with each two different specializations - Gear and loot - Action combo based gameplay - Graphics are correctCons: - Buggy collision (sometimes you hit right on enemy and there is no effect - Gameplay feels mechanic even though it is more actif than your average rpg game. - Lots of quest about talking to a serie of npcs early in game without any explanation about how the game works, juste about some basic background story for some npcs. (could be a positive aspect for some people, I personally just wanted to play and try the gameplay before getting into the side story) - Not a lot of explanation about how to regroup or join friends that aren't at the same starting point as you. (Comes when you can meet, but you have to play 3-4 instances before you can really join. Simply not a game for me. It was over hyped by the community and compared to Vindictus in term of action. I can affirm there is no ressemblance. It is was more mechanical than its Nexon's related.			"

												I would probably recommend this game without a second thought 3-4 years ago back when it was 60-70 lvl cap not today though. Before looking at my 33hours on record and thinking i didn't play the game enough i probably have around 2K hours on the SEA server so trust me i played more then enough of this game and i can say without doubt the game is just dead at this point. They bsaically reworked the entire game to where only late game matters after you reach max level and by the time this review is posted max level is 93 so around lvl1 to 93 is just a grind fest and with the game being already pretty much dead most likely its going to be a solo grind then with actual players. Getting partys for raids and such is so hard if your new basically if your new and looking for a mmo game dont bother with this its not new user friendly at all you will feel you are playing a solo game until you reach max level and get good gear. 3 years ago : HELL YEAH PLAY THIS GAME so much fun doing nests ( 4 man really hard dungeouns ) and dragon nests ( 8man raid ) just do main quests / side quests or grind up with party members today : solo grind to 93. find a way to obtain good gear somehow. try to find a party or guild to do raids with ( too much hassle and pain not worth it anymore ) "

												Dragon nest is the **** it's like playing a single player role playing game with friends.The dungeons are insane and the gameplay  is epic. All the skills are different for each class. Six different classes each with there own subclass The animation may look child like but don't get it wrong the game will blow your mind. Also you don't even need to read the npc text just watching the cutscenes will give you the facts about what going on in the story. There tons of dungeons and pvp arena's. This is one of the best nexon games out there. The download is fast and the controls are easy to use. Theres tons of people to meet. The game is full of 8 people dragon raid dungeons where you can earn uniqe items and equipment. Thier is so much to do in this world even if the animation style is a kiddish approach.			"

												This game is... okay.I love the art style, honestly the only actual problems are the server-side problems, how the client will crash or something similar.Apparently this bug/error hasn't been fixed so that'll hurt this game's score from me super hardcore big time.I love the character designs and pretty much alot about this game.The glitches and bugs are offputting though, i can't deviate from them.My client crashes every once in awhile, I'm sometimes ejected from the server. my client goes directly to desktop when it crashes. The anti-hack crap doesn't always load and therefore the game then also doesn't load. The game sometimes takes forever to launch, one time taking me over a half hour.Until these bugs are fixed, this game can only earn a 2/10 in overall. Honestly a 9/10 in appearance and a 7/10 in gameplay. The 2/10 has the extra 1 point due to the fact the Kali class dances like a dirty stripper, which i eternally love to the ends of the earth.Without that one thing... this game would be stuck at 1/10 for me.

												Unplayable. After 7 minutes of gameplay or entering a new area, CRASH. Create a new character, CRASH. Defeat a boss, CRASH. Obviously the creators didn't take into account that some people just don't have the patience when they have crashed 15 times for these reasons without any way of progressing due to inability to merely travel. The people who have given this game good reviews must either have the patience of a reverse apathetic or they somehow never had this issue.			"

												Dragon Nest is a typical free-to-play MMORPG that you can play solo or with partying with friends. It doesn't offer anything really special compared to other MMOs and it is extremely casual.The graphics are alright and the music is pretty good, the gameplay is fluid... But, that's far from being the issue i'm having with this game. Pay-to-win usually is, you know, somewhat bad and it makes you stronger than players who don't pay or it takes longer to achieve a certain level of power... But in Dragon Nest it's an entirely new story.I started a new character and I was questing with a friends, Monsters took about 3-4 hits each and using spells usually one or two shotted them, you know, pretty standard... Until we earned NX gear from our ""Reward Chest"" at around level 9 (you obtain one of those everytime you level up). It was a full set of NX (paid) gear that lasts 7 days. Now, the monsters I was fighting at around this level had about 50 health maybe... And I was hitting around 10-15 damage with my basic attacks.Well, after I equiped the gear, I was hitting around 4000 with my basic attacks and the monsters were just as weak as before! So for the next few levels, I was 1 hitting everything, including bosses with my basic attack... How fun!Also, in your ""Reward Chest"" you can find ""Goddess's Laments"". They're used to craft armour, weapons and jewelry... But, they have only implemented armour and weapons for the older classes or something, because if you play a Machina, you can only craft jewelry with those crafting materials and nothing else!Another thing, if you have played this game before and you want to play it on Steam, you can never get the Steam exclusive mount, because you need a fresh account to obtain it.Overall, the game is way too easy, anyone could play it with the paid gear you are given and you get it every few levels it seems. I wouldn't bother playing such a game.			"

												Dragon nest is an dungeon based RPG and I wasted half of my summer on this game for few reasons.It has Anime-ish style graphics that I always enjoy.There is alot of contents to do especially max level that is very team oriented.Hundreds of quests to complete and a decent storyline.Fast paced game.Fun game to play with friends.PvP is intense (except fighting assassins).All classes has unique skills and combos.Cash shop is aight.Nice animationsCan see Irine's pantsu.But oh boy those cons though.This game is one of the grindest game I have ever witnessed. I've ran the same dungeon 200 times to get from 60-70.The game has very limited character customization in creation and makes you spend your dough to change your appearance.Gender lock classes.The story can get repetitive since it makes you go back to the same dungeon 10 times so people just grinds the same spot to reach a certain level.You get very little exp from dungeon runs so you level very slow unless you are hardcore at this game.PvP lag is very noticeable in every room.High level nest parties are very discriminative in gear and class.Events are pretty much cash shop related.I r8 it 8/8 "

												Dragon Nest is probably one of the best MMO RPGs out there. It's amazing, and just because it's free to play, doesn't mean you have to buy to progress. The only things you buy are costumes, but, there are better costumes you can wear without paying. I've played around 70 hours, and the campaign still hasn't stopped!  Also, the gameplay is never TOO grindy or easy, It's actually really cool!It seems to be something similar to Final Fantasy, but i'd recommend it much more.			"

												I do not like Dragon Nest, the reason why is I got so bored from playing this game that I got off in the first 38 minutes. I had the highest graphics and didn't lose a frame, but it looked like♥♥♥♥♥♥ I am now going to uninstall the game and whoever looks at this, understands you should not get this game nor buy anything in it. I am not gonna reccomend this to my friends and also another thing.. Maybe you should have a better layour because I CANT FIND A DAMN THING THE IN TOWN WHERE YOUR SUPPOST TO FIND STUFF. I LOOKED ALL OVER AND FOUND NO SHOP OR ANYTHING. Heres a little tip, MAYBE PUT THE ACTION OF THE NPC ABOVE IT. And another thing, who the hell makes your characters, the girls are ugly and the guys LOOK LIKE GIRLS. I hope you change my mind.....			"

That being said if you are new to MMOs i would not reccomend this game. Try most of the mainstream MMOs they will give you a better start to your MMO playing			"

												Dragons Nest, this is not a bad game for free, its rather amuzing and fun.. its just a little dated with graphics, and i guess i can expect that being its going on 2 years old. Is this game worth playintg, sure.. why not.. its fast paced, easy controls, fun gameplay. I mean for free it dont get much better then that. Of course you have the option to buy items in store, but i have not really taken the time to look into their store since there is not much of a community playing the game, so i rather not put any money into buying any cool items from their store as i would see it as a waste. I do recommend this game if you are bored and looking for something to pass the time for a couple weeks while you wait for your next game to be released or something like that. I will definitly be watching out for a part 2 of this game if it ever comes out, hopefully it will full the community.			"

Posted: October 1, 2016
												My impressions from trying Dragon Nest. Up front I'll say I didn't stay to find out how certain things work because my first impressions made me not care enough to do so, so take everything with a grain of salt. Also, the game's changed hands, so what the new management might do in the near future to change any of this I have no idea.TL;DR: I don't hate the game, but it did annoy me, for a number of reasons detailed below.First off, I couldn't find a way to re-bind default keyboard commands.  ---[Edit Note: Uninstalled, so I can't look, but see Amazia's response in the comments about the game's two separate keybind menus.]---  To move stuff around on the hotbars, or add skills to hotbars, or open a map of the default keybinds, yes. But to do something like re-bind the WASD movement to what I normally use in games (for physical reasons, not just preferential ones), no. I looked at least three times, and it's usually pretty obvious in games and the first thing I do in them. This made combat so aggravatingly awkward for me that I don't know if I can comment with any degree of objectivity. I did still manage to hit things in the starting game, and they fell over and coughed some loot onto the ground with their dying breaths, so there's that.Moving on... Gender-specific classes aren't a dealbreaker, and I knew going in and was prepared to ignore that the male characters look like kids and female characters look like short-skirted cheesecake dollies. Welcome to anime-meets-video games, right? To be fair, when it comes to anime or manga, my preferred style is more in the range of any version of Appleseed, say, than this, but I've enjoyed things done in other styles if they had enough going for them. The wispy-girly voice acting for the female characters was annoying as I watched the intro and tutorial cutscenes, and I ended up hitting Mute and accepting that I would miss stuff that way. Female character emote audio wasn't a lot better. The male character audio was... well, it was what you'd expect from a male protagonist anime character in this style. It didn't irk me like the female voices and didn't stick in my mind enough to have an opinion on it.On the subject of character appearances, though... The initial appearance customization options are extremely limited -- three faces and three sets of eyes, maybe four hairstyles, a handful of hair and eye colors and skin tones, one outfit with a few pieces for which you can separately choose from a small selection of colors. Meh. Based on this limited customization, when I looked it up, I expected that Dragon Nest had to be a lot older than it is. I might have forgiven it if it was, or if its characters were so tiny they're just blobs of color with legs and weapons during play. But this isn't a ""tiny blobs of color"" game, so it feels like an ""option B"" game, wherein appearance customization beyond the initial kids' menu of choices will probably involve microtransactions. (Which I'm not automatically against, and purely cosmetic or optional stuff is where I think microtransactions belong. I do think the people keeping a game going deserve to get paid for their work; I've subscribed to or bought stuff in free-to-play games I felt deserved it that had the option to do so. But there's such a thing as going too far to shove people towards the store, and in an MMORPG of this design this falls under ""too far"".) A brief search suggests I'm right, I saw mention of it taking around $30 to customize an outfit, but again, I didn't stick around to find out. Dragon Nest's initial customization is just too ridiculously limited for an MMORPG of this game's age and ""up-close, face to face"" design. I mean, it has animated emotes and a command which is specifically labeled as being for flipping the camera around to take a better screenshot of your character... [Edit to FYI: I hit that while standing too close to a zone portal and the game glitched, locking me into snapshot view with no menus and no key command response but not outright frozen. Tabbing out and closing the game program reset it.] To me, Dragon Nest looks like a game that doesn't promote getting attached to an MMORPG character enough to stick around unless you've already spent money on it, but is also built to constantly remind you of the lack of customization you have access to for free. Which feels kind of like asking me to be attached to a paper cutout because it's possible to draw a face on it if I spend money to do so. As noted above, I don't know if the new management plans to change how customization works, or if so, in what ways. I was prepared to let this pass, albeit not happily. Until I ended up with an inventory full of free ""gifts"" for which I hesitate to use the term...The ""free gifts"" currently available ingame are part of what made me curious to play it, which is presumably a part of their purpose. But compared to other MMOs in which a gift item is typically an item, you assign the character who gets it and it's theirs, these are more like ""real-time-limited free first-time rentals"". I opened the mailbox and pending gifts panes and saw realtime expiration timers (meaning: they will expire in that time whether or not I open them, use them, or play the game at all) of about a week to about a month. Timers again on the resulting boxes once accepted, and timers yet again on the items once removed from the boxes... the ones I could even open, that is. One of these boxes required a minimum level 90 to even receive before it would rot, and a couple items from one I could open had a minimum level of 30 to use.I seldom hurry in MMORPGs, I've never attained max level in my first year of playing one. This is down to my playstyle and time spent hanging out with friends or roleplaying with them, as much as to grind factor or time available to play. So the ""fastest MMO"" splash used to tout this game wasn't a selling point for me, and a row of ticking timers in my character's bagspace wasn't encouragement to go play or invite some friends to play with me, it was encouragement not to. Finding mention that to continue having the items from opened ""gifts"" after they expired, I'd have to pay some form of item rent, didn't help. I assume if I didn't get to the required level in time any unopenable boxes would evaporate.Again, I don't know if ""rent"" meant real-money microtransactions or ingame currency, I didn't care enough at that point to find out. I'll tolerate certain kinds of rental in games, too, specifically only AFTER I've had time to learn the game enough to decide if those things are worth investing in. But when I get a gift box as a newbie in a game that I have to level up in a rush in order to open, when I open that box, whatever's inside had better BE a gift: done and dusted, mine from now on. Not a thing with the same timer on it as the box, that's just a disappointment no matter what it is. As a new player I have no real idea whether it's worth investing the time to get and then to rent to keep that stuff. Which I suppose may be part of the point.A required level of level 30 and maybe a month I get in a game that says it's ""fast""-- or I would, if the resulting item didn't evidently expire at the same time the giftbox it came from would have, instead of ""race to get it, but once I have it it's mine"". Maybe it's encouragement to get out there and play and group with people to beat that timer. But rushing to level 90 for something that might then just go away or lock-until-paid anyway? Nope, I don't want aboard this particular hamster wheel.So, after all of that, a row of countdown timers in my character's inventory was what finally made me feel like this game isn't for me. Seems counterproductive for stuff meant to be player bait. I'm sure there's stuff I'm missing about this game, but it just couldn't draw me in long enough for me to want to find out.			"

												So I came up to this hype of me playing again DN (saw my friend on steam playing it) & since I've gotten so quite busy in the past few months or maybe a year. BUT I SAW ITS ALREADY OWNED BY EYEDENTITY ALREADY??! & I THOUGHT THIS IS OWNED BY NEXON! So I was in shock and immediately look for answers in google, like what is happening! THEN I SAW ITS GONE ALREADY!? ITS NOT NEXON SERVER NO MORE! So I was trying to figure out how do I transfer my old account since that account was made on beta like really fresh dn server lvl 24 cap and no need steam at all! Had 9Chars max lv. 3 chars fully geared on lvl80 Legend +10~+12 and I spend like thousand of hours and money on that account if I will count it prolly 5k or more hrs and for sure under $3k over spend nexon cards. BUT THIS THING BREAKS MY HEART! </3 IT WAS LIMITED TIME ONLY FOR TRANSFERS? IT SAYS THEY EMAIL US, FOR US TO KNOW WHATS GOING ON BUT SERIOUSLY NEXON I DIDNT RECIEVE ANY EMAILS OR NEWS FROM YOU! I know this account has less hrs play on DN cause I never use steam when playing it that was so long ago now I check em out and then this really upset my feelings, this is the one of my very best mmorpg games and now vanish like it was nothing? I dont know if I will play again by any means I will start again like seriously you don't have any idea how I grind that account so much. Guess no DN on me no more since I saw some of nexon FAQ's about the DN Server. Wouldn't recommend on those old players like me that will play again especially if you have same experience with me don't think about it time to move on! and for those new and old player that luckily got their account transfered keep nesting! & HAPPY GAMING! Peace. >,<			"

												After playing this game for more than 400 hours, I have grown to like it a lot. The classes all feel very unique and you will definitely find classes that fit your playstyle. The best thing about this game is the combat system and I feel like it is unrivaled still. The community is also good in a strange way and a lot of people are wiling to help new players out.Bad things about this game- there is a growing gap between veterans and new players. Gearing for a casual player usually just means epic gear. The game has serious balance issues also.Overall, I think people should give this game a try.8/10			"

												Quite the fun experience. As a player who really doesn't care for MMOs, this one actually has caught my attention, and it's always a join to pop back in to see what has been added from time to time. The game however doesn't really pick up until the Level 24 and on mark. Making the early game a bit of a drag I will admit. But they have streamlined it so much from when it first came out (which is when I started playing this game) lessing that time to get to level 24 greatly. HOWEVER you are still going to have to put in the time. If that doesn't sound like something you would be up for, then this game isn't for you. If you feel ready for the challenge, then I say go for it. You won't regret it!			"

Also, you dont have to worry about endgame because they are still updating it and comming out with more stuff to kill :D "

												This is an old game, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good one! I would say that anyone who likes MMO should at least try this game. It's very fun, very cute, but also a tad sexual.. That's the only part I don't like. I always disliked how they make female characters sexual in every game known to man, but never make the men as sexual as the women.. Always hated that. But, it's hard to find a game that doesn't have that, so..The play style in this game feels rewarding as I hit enemies, and the music in the game gives me memories of old times when I played it when I was younger. The character customization doesn't give you many options, but that doesn't matter too much to me because the game is still fun, either way. There is also many classes to choose from, and each class has a different weapon you can pick in game, so there is variety.			"

												I have put a lot of time into this game, I used to play it back when level 50 was cap.  I loved the heck out of this game.  The graphics and the atmosphere as well as the music and voice overs.  The only huge issue I have with it is the marketplace purchases.  I pay $10 for a pet that picks up items for me because lets face it pressing F 100x per a dungeon just gets old after a while.  So with this $10 pet after i purchased it only lasts for 30 days.....  So dumping money into this game is a waste.  Everything on the market expires after a certain time limit.  Nexon is famouse for it.  Play this game for free and love it but i suggest not dumping your money into it unless you can really afford to.			"

												This game so far as of 4.2hrs in and I'm impressed by how simple and fun the combat style is, I also like the feeling of the dungeon themed quests that is implemented. A con i have is the super low resolution artstyle.... If a possible remastered texture/resolution up to 2015 standards. story so far is kinda good I personally don't get into MMO stories. This game reminds me of Vindictus - Combat style is similar but Dragon Nest feels like it has a more attractive story. Quests are dungeon themed style just as Dragon Nest.---Better review over time---			"

												...Run away... now... This thing is so amazing. graphics aren't anything special but not bad either. It draws me back and gives you so much to do. Gives you 20 classes/characters to create and every character has 3 skill trees, 2 and 3 make you choose 1 of 2 options. So, for 1 character you can build that character 4 different ways. So now the Pros and Cons:Pros: Great StoryMany characters and character class choicesEvery Character has a different storyhundreds of hours available to play An actual F2P, not P2W. Easy to run on any CPUA TON of sexual innuendos haha. Cons: Occasionally crashes. Maybe 2 times every 5 hours? Possible lose your data. I personally haven't, but a follower of mine (on twitch) says that his game crashed, and then he lost his character and everything? Overall:I highly recommend this game. it's an incredible time and SO much fun. Somewhat like Zelda, yet also on it's own. Currently only a level 38, out of 80, but it is incredibly addicting and fun. Plus the sexual innuendos is hilarious to myself. Makes me laugh... lol			"

												Oh boy reviewing MMOs, here we go.Pros:- This MMO is really, REALLY fun. I don't know what it is but the gameplay just clicks with me.- Class diversity is alright.- Playing with friends is fun.- Distinct MMO feel but more actiony than most MMOs where you stand in a spot and hit buttons; movement and repositioning are very important aspects of the game.- Grind is MUCH less grindy than most MMOs - quests give a huge chunk of EXP so hitting level cap is fairly easy. - Game rewards skill to a certain degree. I think you can solo all the content in the game if you're good enough. As a solo player this appeals to me.- Lovely aesthetics/visuals.- Runs pretty smooth on my GTX660 (60FPS for the most part except during massive fights/explosions)Cons:- Pay2Win. No way around it, this game is 100% Nexon, which means 100% P2W. Cash items give stats, helpers give stats/autoloot, you can get gambling boxes that can randomly drop stat-giving items, etc. If you don't think this game is P2W you're a moron.- Marketplace is desaturated at lower levels. When I played this game around its release date you could easily find gear for your class/level on the marketplace for reasonable prices, and sell the extra gear you found that you didn't need for around the same amount, but now that the heavy users are all capped out the marketplace is super end-game heavy and super expensive. - Pay2Win. I had to list this twice, this really pisses me off. The game could've been 20000x better without the P2W aspects.- Daily softcaps on dungeons. You get 700 PWR per day and 500 bonus per week, and dungeons cost PWR (I think 12-30 or something). PWR gives you bonus EXP while in dungeons, which means that if you spend your 1200 PWR in a day you don't get bonus EXP and you get gimped. I know at some point before this used to be a hard cap (ie you couldn't enter dungeons at ALL if you had 0 PWR) but I think you can dungeon without PWR now (not 100% sure). This is a minor gripe as it only really affects people playing 6+ hours a day (which I sometimes do).Overall:I do recommend the game if you like the gameplay and visual styles. There's PvP and PvE in the game (both very prominent end-game) and, being quest-based grind, it doesn't feel as grindy as some other MMORPGs. Pay2Win sucks but Nexon is going to be Nexon so unless someone else takes over DN and removes the P2W aspects it's probably just going to get worse (look at Maplestory).			"

												LONG REVIEW INCOMING~I have played this game for over a year now(close to 2 years). I started out off of steam and then downloaded it through Steam.I have multiple characters, 3 max leveled and the rest still working on. I focus primarily on PVP but I also have experience with the nests & Dragon Raids (PVE).I have never once felt the need to purchase items through the Dragon Vault to play the game:>You do not NEED costumes as they are null and void in PVP, and the effect they have on your stats are so minimal that you do not notice a difference in Nests or Raids. (I purchased 2 because I liked how they looked on my character)>You do not NEED a dual skill scroll, I survived with out one (A hybrid build) all the way till recently when I got a free dual skill scroll from an event.>You do not NEED any extra talisman slots, crest slots, etc. (I can do everything max lvl w/o these)>You do not NEED a pet (you get one for free through achievements anyway)>You do not NEED a fancy mount (you get one for free through the main quest)With all that said let's realize something. Nexon gives the players multiple Dragon Vault objects for free as you level up and through seasonal events.>You receive free skill reset scrolls at 15 through Irene, and when you approach each ""previous level cap"" level (40,50,60,70,80) your gift box gives you a free reset scroll. Each of these items are worth $15 or 15k NX yet you receive multiple ones just in case you're new and mess up.>You receive a free mount through the main quest Brownie Joker or Mocha Sugar, yes they are not the must extravagant mounts (They're just horses) they still do the job of allowing the player a quicker way to move. You can also farm for more fancier horses through the higher level nests for free.>Any time there is a technical problem you will most likely receive compensation for the server troubles or problems. Most of the time it involves Dragon Eggs (a small amount but RNG can be merciful). Also Dragon Eggs of any type are just RNG models. Your chances of getting rare items is static. Spending more money will not increase your chances.>Through seasonal events I have received free resets, free dual skill scroll, free costume parts, free pets and more.GAMEPLAY:The Gameplay is fast and entertaining. You must learn how to dodge and be aware of your surroundings for higher level bosses, Raids and Nests. You should know how your moves work (Super Armor & Super Armor Break). It is instance based not open world and therefore the dungeons can be repetitive. The main story I find to be very enjoyable and entertaining.PVP can be difficult due to certain unbalances between classes and frustrating just like every games PVP. PVP is normally equalized or partially equalized so you do not need top gear or any gear to pvp (Unless you are doing Ladder pvp which is more rank based)My advice would be to take the game slow. Try to do the nests at each level avaliable. Level with friends or join a guild it's more fun with a group. Don't specialize in one aspect. Be able to do both PVP and PVE.Hopefully this helps,apologize for the long review ~Have fun gaming!			"

												While Dragon Nest can be a little repetitive and may require power leveling with another higher-level friend to avoid grinding for days, the game contains a surprisingly entertaining cast of characters and plenty of side quests, if you're playing for plot. One of the more enjoyable, entry-level MMORPGs to get into if you're new to the genre.The battle system is simple enough, and all of the classes I've played so far debut with a storyline of their own, which is a plus. It's easy to get hooked, but it's also easy to forget about or drop the game if the XP/leveling curve takes up too much time that you might not have to spend. Overall? Dragon Nest is a cute, fun way to burn a couple hours. It might not be as pretty as Wakfu or Warframe, but you're guaranteed a fairly well-written plot with a battle system that's hard to fault.			"

												A very  cute free to play Nexon MMO, this game doesn't do much in the way of revolutionary graphics or gameplay, but the story is fantastic and it's a thoroughly enjoyable MMO with friends. Solo gameplay is possible, however dungeons can get repetitive if you don't follow the story or have company and friends to play along with, or simply just chat to as you work your way through the game.Cash shop is not pay to win, though many items have a time limit. You can pay more to gain permanent costumes though, and pets require an item to stay alive every 7 days-30 days, which can be purchased in-game or in the cash shop.If you enjoy free to play rpgs with a solid story and adorable art work, check it out. The community is friendly and the story is great- and considering it's free, there's not much to lose!			"

												At first glance, I thought of this as boring, until I actually played the game. The loading screen brings up hype, as well as the characters that you get to play as. Some have different stories, and some go to different places. It's all really exciting. Gameplay is pretty simple. Point, aim, click (with some button mashing as well). The varieties of specializations are interesting because it branches out into two and do the same with the second specialization. The specializations have similiar ideals, but like for Archer as an example, one goes melee, the other is ranged. Quite fascinating. The only problem and the only thorn in my side for this game would be the annoying process of griniding to a higher level JUST to do the story. So if I were to rate it, I wouild give it 4 out of 5 stars.			"

												...Run away... now... This thing is so amazing. graphics aren't anything special but not bad either. It draws me back and gives you so much to do. Gives you 20 classes/characters to create and every character has 3 skill trees, 2 and 3 make you choose 1 of 2 options. So, for 1 character you can build that character 4 different ways. So now the Pros and Cons:Pros: Great StoryMany characters and character class choicesEvery Character has a different storyhundreds of hours available to play An actual F2P, not P2W. Easy to run on any CPUA TON of sexual innuendos haha. Cons: Occasionally crashes. Maybe 2 times every 5 hours? Possible lose your data. I personally haven't, but a follower of mine (on twitch) says that his game crashed, and then he lost his character and everything? Overall:I highly recommend this game. it's an incredible time and SO much fun. Somewhat like Zelda, yet also on it's own. Currently only a level 38, out of 80, but it is incredibly addicting and fun. Plus the sexual innuendos is hilarious to myself. Makes me laugh... lol			"

												Great game to immerse yourself in and see massive amounts of character development. PvE doesn't become grindy, every couple of levels there is another nest and gear set to get, and you consistently become stronger. Also great to play with friends or pick a class that is great at soloing. Either way, an enjoyable experience with hours upon hours gameplay.I havent played very many mmos ive tryed alot but this is by far prob the best one ive played. What I like About The Game1:Fast Action Combat2:Cool Combos And Ability3:Alot Of Different Armor Weapons Ect4:It Isnt P2W From What Ive Seen5:It is playedable and enjoyable even while playing solo.What I Disliked About The Game1:There are some quests that litterally make you go from 1 NPC on one side of the town and back like 10 times.2:The Missions get sometimes repetitive. 3:For Not playing very many MMOs the menus ect are still kinda confusing 4:The Game Doesnt explain everything really well you have to learn alot of things by yourself and finding quest (finding)5:You need to grind sometimes for a long time to level up to do the main quest (Its not bad just something i dislike)(I have 98 hours in the game in 65 day so i do have much experience but in game time ive played decent bit for 1 day...)KEEP IN MIND THIS IS MY OPINION.You can agree Or Disagree. We all have are own opinions.Also Sorry for bad spelling ect I didnt take much time to check my spelling and I Did Caps Like This some places but Not Others lol.			"

												I played this game when it was released around 2011 and decided to pick it up again once I saw that it was on Steam. The combat is very heavy feeling and satisfying, making that Korean MMO-style grind not so unbearable (I play a Paladin and using the skill ""Sacred Hammering"" is fun as hell). Another thing I like, strangely enough, is the quest dialog and characters. the writing is funny, charming, and a pleasure to read. A unique feature is the option to give gifts to NPC's you want to be friends with,  occasionally giving you gifts back and faction points to spend in a shop for items (No one take May, she's mine). A downside is that the ""Free to Play"" system is a little limiting compared to more recent additions in the F2P genre, with things like inventory space being completely locked unless you pay real cash, although figuring out what certain items do allowed me to downsize and I've had considerably less problems with it since.I recommend giving it a try if you picked up that nasty MMO habit again.

												Love the game but it does have some areas that people may not like.•The game can be boring alone and I recomend playing with friends.•There are times that you are tempted to spend real money (as with all free 2 plays).•You need a reasonably good computer (I could not play the game for awhile due to my computer, then again it was a little crappy)•The classes are gender locked (and most classes are girls, there are only four guy classes)Even with these this game is still amazing, the reasons for this include... •A huge skill tree (although not as big as some games)•Great story line•Characters look amazing•The classes branch into specializations•The skills (special attacks) look amazing (especially after getting a specialization)•Costume items give you a cool look until your armor actually looks good (costume items that are given by the game for free will dissapear after a week)•It is easy to switch between servers in game and it is very enjoyable when playing with other people. •Multiple characters can be created on one account (up to 20!)I am currantly at level 52 so this may change as you (or anyone else) progress further in the game, but the game is fun and enjoyable so I would recommend it to anyone with a little free time.

												To be honest, the game is pretty good. I still play it even though I force myself to stop playing it. Only because none of my mates likes the 'Japanese Anime, Cartoony graphics'. But Ive played a few MMORPGs and this is one stands out in when it comes to the quest and dungeoning game play.  Here's a list of pros and cons in my point of viewPro's- Fast paced gameplay (skills and graphics *thumbs up*)- Pretty good for a Free to Play game- The monsters and their abilities are pretty cool- When I reached lvl 25+ The game actually gets harder. (its not just about left clicking anymore, timing the right skills is crucial)- Choices between Easy/Normal/Master/Abbys when it comes to dungeons is handy- Good set of classes. (I played as swordsman and tinker)Con's- Everything's seems like a dungeon base PVE which is something I didnt really like. (Im just a big fan of open world)- I feel like its one of those PTW games. (when it comes to armour upgrading... when I hit lvl 32+ I feel like I need the best armour I can)- Its hard to meet people around your level (when I reached lvl 25+) so it gets a bit of grindy- Its hard to make money to get awesome items. In conclusion, I think its a game worth trying. But its alot better played with friends (then again that goes without saying with every other game). I still give it a thumbs up!! "

												A very  cute free to play Nexon MMO, this game doesn't do much in the way of revolutionary graphics or gameplay, but the story is fantastic and it's a thoroughly enjoyable MMO with friends. Solo gameplay is possible, however dungeons can get repetitive if you don't follow the story or have company and friends to play along with, or simply just chat to as you work your way through the game.Cash shop is not pay to win, though many items have a time limit. You can pay more to gain permanent costumes though, and pets require an item to stay alive every 7 days-30 days, which can be purchased in-game or in the cash shop.If you enjoy free to play rpgs with a solid story and adorable art work, check it out. The community is friendly and the story is great- and considering it's free, there's not much to lose!			"

												I'm not exaggerating that this may very well be the best game I have ever played. It's gameplay and graphical factors are unmatched in the gaming world. However, I do have a few complaints.1. Gender Lock. It's very frustrating to have interest in a class, but doesn't come in... uh... ""male sizes."" To put it simply, I originally wanted to be a Lencea. However, I didn't want to be stuck in a girl's body while I was playing (no offense.) 2. Graphics. This is indeed just my computer, but the graphics are overwhelming. I had to turn down all of the graphical settings just to play it decently. Again, this is just me, but it is an issue.3. Y u crash? This game has crashed for me atleast 10 times now.Besides the complaints listed above, this game is outstanding. Instant 10/10! As I said before, the gameplay is absolutely outstanding. However, due to complaints, it's been reduced to 9/10. I definitely recommend this game if you have a fast computer (unlike mine). Enjoy the game!			"

												I really like this game and the new idea of third person,fast-paced,action MMO with decent story element added to it.There is a lot of this game to be inproved like adding a trading system.There is a big factor in the game that can ruin PVP or even PVE,it's lag. If you have lagg in this game it can ruin the whole experience when you think the oppenent is some where and then it seems like they teleported. It can be frustrating when there is lag but if you don't have any lagg or internet connection errors it can be an awsome experience.I recommend this game for anyone who wants to play something new in the MMO genere.

												After playing this game for more than 400 hours, I have grown to like it a lot. The classes all feel very unique and you will definitely find classes that fit your playstyle. The best thing about this game is the combat system and I feel like it is unrivaled still. The community is also good in a strange way and a lot of people are wiling to help new players out.Bad things about this game- there is a growing gap between veterans and new players. Gearing for a casual player usually just means epic gear. The game has serious balance issues also.Overall, I think people should give this game a try.8/10			"

												Dragon Nest does one thing, and it does it well: fast-paced action combat. The skills that you use in battle are visually spectacular, there are tons of cool combos you can pull off, and the dozens of playable classes ensure that you will not get bored quickly. If you can look past the outdated graphics and having to run the same dungeons multiple times, you will have a great time.			"

												Honestly i've played alot of this game and there is a few things I must list off.1. Insanely good graphics- This is a good thing for me and alot of other users/players out there with bad computers.Even though my computer is bad I can run this on its highest graphics which is a good thing for me.2. Fast Paced Combat- Alot of you know what that is but unlike other mmorpgs this is a hard thing to do but fun.It makes you analyze your opponents and choose what skills you use, but thats not this same for all classes some class you can just get in there kill and walk out ( of course looting the dead npcs enemys first ).3. Friendly community- This is said to be in alot of mmorpgs but thanks to the mods and admins everyone here is nice, funny, and you can always find someone to help you with a harder dungeon. Which leads me to my next one.4. Dungeons- The dungeons may get a little repetitive but thats just with the design and even thats not guaranteed. With each new level there's different groups of enemys, places, chests, bosses. The only way I found so far to get the same exact level is to play the same one again.5. Fun Story Line- This may not seem like a big one but it is, without a fun story line the game's just not worth playing.This game has a interesting story line to say the least, not only that, but it keeps you on you feet. Even when I got bored and left the game to do something else, I always kept coming back to see what happens next.6. Completely Free- This game is completely free which is hard to say since I gave it good reviews and it's free, but it's true. You can do everything in the story line even the expansions. This is the one exception, and that's the market place which is to be expected in any MMO/RPG or combination of the two.So all in all this is a really great game. "

												I'll be short and clear with this game. (I played this before it came out of steam)Pro:-there is no problem hitting max level-fun action mechanic-Variety of nest out there (BUT you can't play them)Con:-People who says this game is ez or can run any dungeon solo without sweat... LOL the true fun comes when you actually get to solo nests, not a dungeon. unless you spent crazy amount of cash into this game like them most ppl can't even solo abyss level dungeons-Black dragon nest? watever nests that give you super rare item? you think you can run them by just joining any party group? dont even hope so. People with best gear only plays with people with same or slightly less gear. if you want to run that nest you will either have to pay them real money or so much gold to have 1 run together. all these people who've been playing since beta or watever are now acting all cocky and jerks. basically only way to get those legendary gear is to pay them, run the nest together, get part of gear (if you dont then too bad for you), pay them again for another run, you repeat this until u get all ur gears. Those nests up there aren't for everyone.			"

												short review: it's a fun game, don't get me wrong, it PLAYS pretty fun, kind of like an mmo meets a fighting game. that's about it for the NA version. it's run by nexon ofcourse.... if that immediatly spells doom as you read this, merry birthmas, you know how nexon works. there's a lot of limitations from waitng to trade, what you can trade, when you can use the auction house, what you can auction, amongst other things. being nexon, you KNOW the cash shop is ... ""aaawwweeesooommeee"" right?.. not really.Short answer? get the cherry credits version. more up to date, better overall experience, more freedom with trade and auction house stuff.			"

												Solid gameplay, has an actual ""story"" , small size, no lag, instanced system is surprisingly unobtrusive...Voice work is kinda hit and miss, and the graphics, while okay, probably should be touched up a bit.Character creation is a bit lackluster, but the way classes are set up is pretty good.Overall, 8/10, would be ♥♥♥♥♥slapped by crazy ninja elf dominatrix stripper again.

												I really like this game, the combat system is very fast and smooth, the graphics are really nice, and the cutscenes are the best! The only problem is the very small lag in big areas such as towns, cities, and villages, this is caused by the amount of people on at once. I very highly recommend this game for people who like fantasy based rpg games.			"

												Used to play when the game was just getting started. I lost my steam account then due to my laptop breaking. So i decided to take a 2 year break from it. And now I'm back! They've added the assassin and then eventually added Lencea. But this game has it's pros and cons. Pros: 1. Features different storylines for the different characters.2. Fighting style and combat is just overwhelming. Different specialties and subclasses can be chosen.3. It's original. I haven't seen any other games like this and is possibly the closest thing to SAO I have seen.Cons: 1. Though the storyline is great, some main quests require you to be a certain level. And after getting to lvl. 40, leveling up is gonna take some time unless you're in a level 30 guild or have the 200% exp scroll.2. Server problems. Sometimes the game will log you out. ""Disconnected from world"" This might happen but it's not a big deal. 3. It takes a little while to adjust to the game. All the different letters open up different things. But once you're in the game click the letter ""H"" this open up a guide that tells you what each key is used for. Also there are so many skills, it would take up the whole number pad and it'll be a bit frustrating moving your fingers from ASWD to the number 0 or 9.Overall this game is great. 10/10 I recommend it to anyone whoo is into Adventures, Actions, Storylines, and MMORPG. Though the graphics may be a bit cartoonish, it is a great game.			"

												Good luck finding any current information on the class you want to play, but damn is this game fun.The developers seem to have a focus on PvE, though.

												I have put a lot of time into this game, I used to play it back when level 50 was cap.  I loved the heck out of this game.  The graphics and the atmosphere as well as the music and voice overs.  The only huge issue I have with it is the marketplace purchases.  I pay $10 for a pet that picks up items for me because lets face it pressing F 100x per a dungeon just gets old after a while.  So with this $10 pet after i purchased it only lasts for 30 days.....  So dumping money into this game is a waste.  Everything on the market expires after a certain time limit.  Nexon is famouse for it.  Play this game for free and love it but i suggest not dumping your money into it unless you can really afford to.			"

The skills that you use in battle are visually spectacular, there are tons of cool combos you can pull off, and the dozens of playable classes ensure that you will not get bored quickly. If you can look past the outdated graphics and having to run the same dungeons multiple times, you will have a great time.			"

												Dragon Nest is a gem among MMORPGs. The game sports an incredibly satisfying combat system that never gets dull whilst you slice and dice through thousands of mobs. I haven't played all of the classes yet, but the ones I have played are all equally entertaining and flashy. Hit up your weeb friends and play it with them because if you play alone you'll probably get sick and tired of grinding dungeons solo. Either that or make some new friends with the... colorful players that also play on their lonesome. Guilds are also a thing, join my guild. Apply to the Poot Empire! POOT POOT!The story had me captivated at first but quickly became too convoluded to be worth reading through so I just skip all that nonsense.

												Dragon Nest incorporates non-targeting system gameplay to create a fast paced action filled experience. Players choose from a range of hero classes, characters that are of the Dragon Nest storyline that can equip customizable gear and weapons. Characters exist in one world, Kalahan, which resulted from Nexon uniting all four worlds to unite the characters. Devastating skills can also be learned, to increase one's power when defeating monsters in instanced dungeons or defeating other players in PVP.Dragon Nest also has the advantage of being nearly completely skill-based, with lower level characters being able to defeat high level characters in PVP with skill alone. This allows a more experienced player that is of a lower level to dominate a less experienced player of a higher level player in PVP. I highly recommend Dragon Nest to all you hardcore players!			"

												As someone who's played DN for well over 5 years, I was both sorely disappointed and infuriated with the company 'switch.' I'd spent a good deal of money on Dragon Vault items, leveled over 10 characters, and spent a combined ttal of over 800 hours (including before DN was on Steam) in game. Then, Nexon just decided to DROP the game. No warning through emails, no kiss my♥♥♥♥♥ no nothing. Just account deleted when I went to log on. I lost everything. I am too furious at the horrible customer service and the way they just decided to pretty much screw over all their old players. How hard is it to port accounts? Seriously. I played FFXIV and they kept all my data over the years despite not playing for years on end.Honestly, can't recommend this game to anyone anymore. Go play Guild Wars, WoW or Final Fantasy XIV if you want a good fantasy MMO game. And a company that won't delete all your data because they're too lazy to port.			"

												Dragons Nest is an MMORPG with a wide range of class each of which curtails off into seperate specializations. With anime style graphics you won't be getting anything like PoE or Diablo 3, but they are endearing in its own little way. I enjoyed the game but many parts of it especially if you are a new player can feel like a grind fest for lack of knowledge about better or faster ways to level. Party play is encouraged in many respects but do not expect to make many new friends in game. You can join which have levels of their own and some of which are well run and regulated. The gameplay is fun but can get repetitive. Level cap days a good amount of time to reach especially your first time. Events on holidays are also fun.			"

												Pros:- I really like the fluid combat system; its much more preferred to the lock-on system I'm used to.- Cute, simple art style.- Low poly graphics make it playable on low-end laptops like my own, which is pretty sweet. - Really fun to try out different combat plastyles of different classes.- Pretty friendly in-game community.- Can get pretty decently geared through casual, f2p gameplay alone.- Really fast levelling, so you can get to end game content quickly.Cons:- Levelling may be a little TOO easy. Things only start to get challenging in end-game content.- I personally like to solo content, but Dragon Nest encourages being in a party/guild. If you insist on solo-ing, things start to feel more like a boring grind-fest.- You eventually reach a point where the only way to get stronger is with paid cosmetic items. It takes a while to get to that point, though. And their stats don't make a huge difference, but you do still end up with p2p players being more geared than f2p players.Overall, fun little game to jump into.			"

												It is fun at first when you solo, but being an MMO it soon loses it's fun late game as it pressures you too look for parties with similar interests. However this game is very fun with friends.  Playing with friends presents higher rewards as well. You can play the game alone and you likely won't get anything out of it but playing with a full party you're liable to have lots of fun and get lots of good loot. Characters that you can choose from are stock so don't expect to pick a class and then changing the gender.  You wanna be a girl you have the choices between the Archer, Kali, Sorceress, and Tinker. You wann play a guy ? Then Warrior and Cleric are for you. If the idea of stock characters doesn't bother you but rather the game play does? Each of the characters are different and each have different styles of play. This game literally has everything. You like shooting? Then play an Archer or sorceress. Granted the sorceress has more AOE type skills. Ya wanna beat enemies to a pulp up close and personal than be a warrior, cleric, or a kali ( dancer) if you wanna cast aoe while you do so.  Hell try the tinker too its gots shooting, aoe, and even a giant robot named Alfredo!			"

My Thoughts/About The Game Let me be clear. I have logged over 1,000 hours into game. I was a member of the game way back. I figured I should get DragonNest through steam, because it has been awhile.Honestly, I got bored of the game. Overall, I left the community, but I decided to come back to see what had changed. Here is what I think about the game.Pros:+ Combat is unqiue+ Multiple classes+ Nests (They are like big boss dungeons)+ New updates happen often+ Pets+ Farming+ Marketplace for trading+ Do sexy dances+ Can play as a loli+ Mercenaries (Helpful allies)+ Cash shop+ Fast travel in towns+ Mounts+ Free to playCons:- Broken balancing between classes- Most classes have stories that are repetitive- Pvp needs to be fixed- There should be a way to communicate with people in-game other than using chat- Can't use mounts outside of towns- Community is a bit toxic In Conclusion  This is a great MMORPG. The game truly earns the title, the world's fastest action MMORPG. I still love the game, and you should totally try it out. It's super easy to lvl up in this game because it's so ridiculously easy. I don't understand why they removed higher difficulties in some dungeons. I believe you don't need to buy stuff from the cash shop to stand out, but whateverl. In conclusion,  I recommend  this game.			"

												Excellent game, nice to hop on a slaughter for a minute, progressions is to be expected, but done well. The experience is enjoyable, and comes with plenty of fluff and ribbons to keep the attention! I give it a 9.5/10 (It's still a relatively linear MMORPG, even if its replayability is delightful)!

												Talking from 80 patch through 90 patch, some things have changed and somethings have stayed. Sadly though, this game is less about the 89 levels you will achieve now and more about that level 90 since nothing matters untill that point. The game has been like this a little bit but never so hard untill 90 patch.  So for now, I'm going to give a pro and con list on what I think is good about this game and what is not.  I'll also be talking about common problems people say they have with this game and why its true and not true.Pro:Good combat, by far it is one of the most fluent and cool looking combat I have ever seen.Most of the skills you obtain from your class are cool looking.Leveling up is not so bad.There are so many nice people that will help you, dont get me wrong there are jerks in this game but people see these people more often because they join parties instantly without any idea of what to do about mechs and what gear to have to do the nest so they get kicked. IF you do not want to be kicked, just create the party and say ""Carry pls"" or ""Practice"" since if you join a 90 nest party and people see you do not have the proper gear to contribute, they will kick since they dont want to risks.The guilds, I feel like people who make guilds in this game are really good at it, the really high level guilds somehow manage to keep the right ranks of each person, make sure everyone gets the help they need, and also make everyone happy and have a fun time with each other.  Smaller guilds are the same thing but more often there are worse guilds; dont get me wrong there are many good small guilds just that some of them are small because they are bad.Nests and raid 80-90 patch.  I was never really fond of the ""Do this little mini-game to get pass this area"" type of thing.  The Dragon Nest dev's are deffinitely not good at those things but each boss they make have really good mechanics and fun play against.The possibility of being able to solo.  Now this topic is really hard to discuss since most of you are probably already saying ""If you never get hit in a nest you can solo anything."" Or ""If you have the proper gear it doesnt matter being able to solo level 90 regular nest, you just do too much damage."" what I come in turn of being able to solo is that no matter what gear you have as long as you have level 90 gear that is enhanced even by a little, you are being able to solo a dungeon while being able to take a few hits.  Humans make mistakes, they will get hit, not everyone can do a no hit run.  Just the proper weapon/armor (not even gems/crests) and you can solo the level 90 nests right now but will take a long time.Now onto the cons, no game is perfect just keep that in mind; I do not want people saying that this game is better than this game for this reason, its just a big mess of crap.  Just see what you like about mmo's and what you hate about them, if any of them are in the list make a chart with those pro and cons, if pro or con outweighs, you choose from there.Cons:Jelly's, by how much I will say this game is deffinitely not pay to win, this one part is most likely the most pay to win part.  Jelly's make it so any gear that you want to enhanced that is 6+ wont break, problem with this? You can only pay to gain these or events. No other way.  People also sell these in mp for around 550g-600g for 50 of them, btw it cost 11 to upgrade just epic gear per try.Lag: Somethings this game lags quite a bit depending on the map; the new nightmare dungeon for me lags more than the main raid with everyone throwing out their abilities with 8 people in raid party vs soloing the nightmare dungeon. I think this is due to the fact with just so many air particles in that dungeon.  What I would like is that if Nexon would turn off air particles so that it makes computer lag less UNLESS if its to fit a important raid like the Desert Dragon.Obtaining gear: Sometimes obtaining gear is easy, other times it is deffinitely not.  Gear, accessories, dragon gems, and crests can be expensive for newer players.  Some of the best gear (like Nightmare weapons) are also impossible to buy so you have to earn them.  I personally dont see that as a problem but for some of you out there it is.Mechanics: I know, I said the mechanics on bosses in this game are really good; problem is at first its annoying.  There are party wipe mechanics that are annoying and sometimes hard to time if you did not practice it about 5-6 times. Kind of annoying but not a big problem. No more practice nests/raids: There used to be a option called ""Practice"" on nests/raids, this makes it so that you dont lose any durability and or clears while doing that certain dungeon.  It was made to practice it obiovously.  I have no idea why they took this out and I think they should have just implemented this on 90 dungeons.Levels 1-89 dont matter: Any gear you obtain from level 1-89 wont matter once you reach level 90; no matter how enhanced they are.  It does not matter if their 10+ or even 11+ enhancement they will be useless even if they were level 87. Why? The new dragon gems are super valuable and its out leveled by level 90 gear. Which the gems can be equiped with level 90 epics (blue).Removed nests/raids/difficulties: I remember when level 16 nest had the abyss difficulty on it, was removed far back since people would spam those dungeons; waste no pwr; and gain hundreds of gold by the gold rabbit with little to no effort.  Now, level 60-70 dungeons dont have abyss difficulty and I find that stupid since its so much harder to level up even though this game its not hard to level up in.  Also the removal of more than HALF of hte nests and raids really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.  They should have just kept the raids/nests if they are reworking them, or even better make new level 90 nests but I guess 1 new level 90 nest is enough like 1 level 80 nest.Discussion: Now many people I have seen on this review area say this game is PAY TO WIN.  What makes a game pay to win is when you will not reach end game if you do not pay for certain items, when you cant achieve gold without paying, or when you cant even do anything due to the fact of other reasons.  This game is not pay to win because achieving gold is not difficult in this game if your not lazy; do not blame the game if you are lazy that is just you.  Selling nx things like jelly beans is a fast way to obtain gold but reallity, its not worth it unless your a millionair.  Most rich people in dragon nest dont even spend a dime on the game unless they want a costume for one of hteir characters, not to make gold.Overall: It is a great game for those who want to be in end game content and are willing to spend a lot of time to get there. If you are not dedicated to do so and or are lazy just look away from this game because you will give up when you reach level 90 and get kicked for not thinking or watching video's at least of the mechanics. If dedicated, 9/10, a game worth your dedication and hard work but will have a few issue's for you but will be worth it.; if you are lazy and not dedicated, 7/10, a game with a couple of flaws and should be played time to time, not worth playing a lot.This is the first review I done so I hope this helps you on choosing to download this game or not; if you just read this bottom paragraph or just skimmed through the list please reread it because if you do decide to download this game and dont like it, you will waste hours while if you had read this you would have only wasted minutes.  The average rating of this game is 8/10 combining the 2 scores above.  I hope you guys have fun time nesting.			"

												For a FTP game, this mmorpg has the capabilities to compete with games such as Destiny and Warframe. Can get a bit boring when you are playing on your own but playing with your friends to complete a certain goal produces a great feeling. The community isn't as bad as some people may say (I havent been playing for a long time though so Idk). Overall, Dragon Nest is the game that is ALL MOST A CARBON COPY OF LOG HORIZON. Which is very cool.Maybe they could copy the anime's idea of using abandoned Japan as a map. Maybe Dragon Nest could change the map by  region.			"

												This is my favorite MMO I have ever played and I have played quite a few. The games combat, pvp, dugeons, etc are ok until you get to lvl cap. After you get to lvl cap the nests and combat, pvp, etc are extremely fun. It may seem that i do not have many hours recorded, but I have many hours of playing on Dragon Nest China, South East Asia, and Europe. Although I absolutly love this game and recommend it. I also recommend you play on a different Channer/Server. The least laggy from the US being DN EU (Dragon Nest Europe). The owners of NA are awful compared to that of other countrys and alot of  values such as starting HP, MP, DMG, etc are a bit broken in NA. The other countries also have a lot better community and population base.			"

												I really like this game and the new idea of third person,fast-paced,action MMO with decent story element added to it.There is a lot of this game to be inproved like adding a trading system.There is a big factor in the game that can ruin PVP or even PVE,it's lag. If you have lagg in this game it can ruin the whole experience when you think the oppenent is some where and then it seems like they teleported. It can be frustrating when there is lag but if you don't have any lagg or internet connection errors it can be an awsome experience.I recommend this game for anyone who wants to play something new in the MMO genere.

												I played this game when it was released around 2011 and decided to pick it up again once I saw that it was on Steam. The combat is very heavy feeling and satisfying, making that Korean MMO-style grind not so unbearable (I play a Paladin and using the skill ""Sacred Hammering"" is fun as hell). Another thing I like, strangely enough, is the quest dialog and characters. the writing is funny, charming, and a pleasure to read. A unique feature is the option to give gifts to NPC's you want to be friends with,  occasionally giving you gifts back and faction points to spend in a shop for items (No one take May, she's mine). A downside is that the ""Free to Play"" system is a little limiting compared to more recent additions in the F2P genre, with things like inventory space being completely locked unless you pay real cash, although figuring out what certain items do allowed me to downsize and I've had considerably less problems with it since.I recommend giving it a try if you picked up that nasty MMO habit again.

												Love the game but it does have some areas that people may not like.•The game can be boring alone and I recomend playing with friends.•There are times that you are tempted to spend real money (as with all free 2 plays).•You need a reasonably good computer (I could not play the game for awhile due to my computer, then again it was a little crappy)•The classes are gender locked (and most classes are girls, there are only four guy classes)Even with these this game is still amazing, the reasons for this include... •A huge skill tree (although not as big as some games)•Great story line•Characters look amazing•The classes branch into specializations•The skills (special attacks) look amazing (especially after getting a specialization)•Costume items give you a cool look until your armor actually looks good (costume items that are given by the game for free will dissapear after a week)•It is easy to switch between servers in game and it is very enjoyable when playing with other people. •Multiple characters can be created on one account (up to 20!)I am currantly at level 52 so this may change as you (or anyone else) progress further in the game, but the game is fun and enjoyable so I would recommend it to anyone with a little free time.

												The combat is fast-paced and interesting. There are some grinding elements to the game. It's got some pay to win elements, but mostly if you want to look cool or max your gear quickly and safely. PvP is somewhat broken, but it is ""balanced"" in that cash shop costumes have no effect in PvP. The level cap is just going up and up, and new content is always being added. Highly reccommended.

												I love this game, been playing it for many years, since beta actually. It started much slower and grindier, now it's come to a point where the grind isn't to to bad. it is however still an action rpg that is instance based, so it is very very repetitive. Gear is the same way you have to grind the same maps for a chance at specific pieces to drop. But no worse than RO, lineage 2, or any other J-rpg i've ever played. if you like J-rpg's you'll like this one. even the story is pretty good if you decide to read it as you're going through. Combat is pretty good but ping will make you hate yourself and others in team pvp, combo's are super satisfying to chain together, abilitys have the right amount of spectical with flashes and pretty light effects to keep you interested. Class growth is pretty satisfying aswell. you have a 1st 2nd and 3rd class to advance through, each class has two branches of specialization spare nightmare classes. and yeah its good♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Talking from 80 patch through 90 patch, some things have changed and somethings have stayed. Sadly though, this game is less about the 89 levels you will achieve now and more about that level 90 since nothing matters untill that point. The game has been like this a little bit but never so hard untill 90 patch.  So for now, I'm going to give a pro and con list on what I think is good about this game and what is not.  I'll also be talking about common problems people say they have with this game and why its true and not true.Pro:Good combat, by far it is one of the most fluent and cool looking combat I have ever seen.Most of the skills you obtain from your class are cool looking.Leveling up is not so bad.There are so many nice people that will help you, dont get me wrong there are jerks in this game but people see these people more often because they join parties instantly without any idea of what to do about mechs and what gear to have to do the nest so they get kicked. IF you do not want to be kicked, just create the party and say ""Carry pls"" or ""Practice"" since if you join a 90 nest party and people see you do not have the proper gear to contribute, they will kick since they dont want to risks.The guilds, I feel like people who make guilds in this game are really good at it, the really high level guilds somehow manage to keep the right ranks of each person, make sure everyone gets the help they need, and also make everyone happy and have a fun time with each other.  Smaller guilds are the same thing but more often there are worse guilds; dont get me wrong there are many good small guilds just that some of them are small because they are bad.Nests and raid 80-90 patch.  I was never really fond of the ""Do this little mini-game to get pass this area"" type of thing.  The Dragon Nest dev's are deffinitely not good at those things but each boss they make have really good mechanics and fun play against.The possibility of being able to solo.  Now this topic is really hard to discuss since most of you are probably already saying ""If you never get hit in a nest you can solo anything."" Or ""If you have the proper gear it doesnt matter being able to solo level 90 regular nest, you just do too much damage."" what I come in turn of being able to solo is that no matter what gear you have as long as you have level 90 gear that is enhanced even by a little, you are being able to solo a dungeon while being able to take a few hits.  Humans make mistakes, they will get hit, not everyone can do a no hit run.  Just the proper weapon/armor (not even gems/crests) and you can solo the level 90 nests right now but will take a long time.Now onto the cons, no game is perfect just keep that in mind; I do not want people saying that this game is better than this game for this reason, its just a big mess of crap.  Just see what you like about mmo's and what you hate about them, if any of them are in the list make a chart with those pro and cons, if pro or con outweighs, you choose from there.Cons:Jelly's, by how much I will say this game is deffinitely not pay to win, this one part is most likely the most pay to win part.  Jelly's make it so any gear that you want to enhanced that is 6+ wont break, problem with this? You can only pay to gain these or events. No other way.  People also sell these in mp for around 550g-600g for 50 of them, btw it cost 11 to upgrade just epic gear per try.Lag: Somethings this game lags quite a bit depending on the map; the new nightmare dungeon for me lags more than the main raid with everyone throwing out their abilities with 8 people in raid party vs soloing the nightmare dungeon. I think this is due to the fact with just so many air particles in that dungeon.  What I would like is that if Nexon would turn off air particles so that it makes computer lag less UNLESS if its to fit a important raid like the Desert Dragon.Obtaining gear: Sometimes obtaining gear is easy, other times it is deffinitely not.  Gear, accessories, dragon gems, and crests can be expensive for newer players.  Some of the best gear (like Nightmare weapons) are also impossible to buy so you have to earn them.  I personally dont see that as a problem but for some of you out there it is.Mechanics: I know, I said the mechanics on bosses in this game are really good; problem is at first its annoying.  There are party wipe mechanics that are annoying and sometimes hard to time if you did not practice it about 5-6 times. Kind of annoying but not a big problem. No more practice nests/raids: There used to be a option called ""Practice"" on nests/raids, this makes it so that you dont lose any durability and or clears while doing that certain dungeon.  It was made to practice it obiovously.  I have no idea why they took this out and I think they should have just implemented this on 90 dungeons.Levels 1-89 dont matter: Any gear you obtain from level 1-89 wont matter once you reach level 90; no matter how enhanced they are.  It does not matter if their 10+ or even 11+ enhancement they will be useless even if they were level 87. Why? The new dragon gems are super valuable and its out leveled by level 90 gear. Which the gems can be equiped with level 90 epics (blue).Removed nests/raids/difficulties: I remember when level 16 nest had the abyss difficulty on it, was removed far back since people would spam those dungeons; waste no pwr; and gain hundreds of gold by the gold rabbit with little to no effort.  Now, level 60-70 dungeons dont have abyss difficulty and I find that stupid since its so much harder to level up even though this game its not hard to level up in.  Also the removal of more than HALF of hte nests and raids really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.  They should have just kept the raids/nests if they are reworking them, or even better make new level 90 nests but I guess 1 new level 90 nest is enough like 1 level 80 nest.Discussion: Now many people I have seen on this review area say this game is PAY TO WIN.  What makes a game pay to win is when you will not reach end game if you do not pay for certain items, when you cant achieve gold without paying, or when you cant even do anything due to the fact of other reasons.  This game is not pay to win because achieving gold is not difficult in this game if your not lazy; do not blame the game if you are lazy that is just you.  Selling nx things like jelly beans is a fast way to obtain gold but reallity, its not worth it unless your a millionair.  Most rich people in dragon nest dont even spend a dime on the game unless they want a costume for one of hteir characters, not to make gold.Overall: It is a great game for those who want to be in end game content and are willing to spend a lot of time to get there. If you are not dedicated to do so and or are lazy just look away from this game because you will give up when you reach level 90 and get kicked for not thinking or watching video's at least of the mechanics. If dedicated, 9/10, a game worth your dedication and hard work but will have a few issue's for you but will be worth it.; if you are lazy and not dedicated, 7/10, a game with a couple of flaws and should be played time to time, not worth playing a lot.This is the first review I done so I hope this helps you on choosing to download this game or not; if you just read this bottom paragraph or just skimmed through the list please reread it because if you do decide to download this game and dont like it, you will waste hours while if you had read this you would have only wasted minutes.  The average rating of this game is 8/10 combining the 2 scores above.  I hope you guys have fun time nesting.			"

												So far my experience with F2P MMOs hasn’t been to great. Then I found this. If your interested in fluent combat which uses non-targeting combat Dragon nest has that. Skills, basic attack, special attacks, and dodge create a great experience compared to your standard click and grind. Movement and combos add entertainment to the action as well as four difficulty settings ranging from easy to abyss to keep things fun and offer an additional challenge. It also has an interesting and pleasant quests line that are both grind and story based. Plus a blend of cut scenes adds another level to your standard free to play titles.			"

												Honestly, I loved this game with a passion. Splendid soundtrack, wasn't TOO much of a pay-to-win game, it was well made, the combat system was AMAZING, there were several classes with some really neat specilizations you could choose from when getting to a certain level, on top of that, levelling up your character wasn't too particularly hard. The game was just... excellent.That is, until the update came. The update that removed some very important things. Such as quests on the message boards, stages that had high rewards, which, without those it's significantly more difficult to actually make a decent profit off of level completion, sometimes even after one you could potentially lose cash from repairing your gear. Sure it added the level 90 cap, and the players were waiting for that for months on end, but were soon to realize it was more of a disappointment than something nice.However, they are still updating the game and not abandoning it, which is awesome, and when they add new classes, I am sure to hop on and check them out. The Dragon Nest team has created something incredible, and I really wish for it to only get better, but honestly with that update, I'm not so sure it will happen.I really do recommend this to people who are looking for a quick time-killing game, but I would not suggest becoming a hardcore fan that wastes all their time playing this one game in particular. You'll just end up disappointed, like I was.In the end, I still like Dragon Nest, I do play occasionally, and it is definitely one of my all times RPG's, but it's just not... that great anymore.			"

												EDIT 8/15/2016:As of the date above, I am changing my review of this game from positive to negative. The game is falling apart.I don't know what the developers are doing, but alot of the game's content has been removed. Specifically the ""Nests"" - Special dungeons that used to be run in party's to get decent gear and drops for your level bracket.They have removed nearly all the nests except the ones for very high levels (dont quote me on this) but I believe any Nests under level 70 or 80 have been removed entirely.Also, board quests have been completely removed from the game (bonus quests that you could pick up to turn in for xp. Posted on small boards before dungeon entrances). Those board quests made grinding an option, as many were repeatable for xp. They also gave people the option to not have to run through any quests but the main story quest line. Now you are actually forced to go through numerous npc side quests for reasonable xp. This is a very frustrating point for people who have more than one character and dont wanna have to re-read the entire storys content/ menial side content.I've noticed large portions of the game's dialogue is now showing up in korean. I know this is a korean developed game, but everything in this version was originally properly translated and coded into english. It's very frustrating now to click on things like NPC's or boards only for it to come up completely in Korean and you have 0 idea whatis being said.*THIS GAME NO LONGER HAS A DIFFICULTY LEVEL. THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY!Yes folks, you read that right. After taking hiatus from this game, returning, and making a new character on the newely released silver hunter class- I was legitimately shocked, and disgusted at how easy the dungeons were.I was able to basically 2 hit everything in the dungeons. BUT IT GETS BETTER!As you level, nexon gives you this free special level up chest you can open which often has 5 to 7 day costumes and acessories you can equip to make your character look nice. But guess what? Those sets give stat benefits. Literally be amazed as you equip your costume and go from 2 shotting, to 1 shotting literally everything in the dungeons- INCLUDING the boss of each dungeon. I kid you not, 1 skill was all it took me to defeat bosses, and it gave me 0 satisfaction.I brought a friend who was new to the game to try to play with me, and even he complained about the game being too easy. He said he didn't feel like he really was doing anything.Even hard mode still poses 0 challenge, even if you have sh*t common gears and weaponry.I also heard the highest difficulty setting for the dungeons ABYSS mode (which also dished out the best xp and rewards for completion), was removed completely for all the low to mid level dungeons and are only reserved for very high level dungeons (again i believe somewhere above lvl 70 to 80 but don't quote me). I can only confirm that there was no abyss mode for the lower level dungeons anymore, as I was too disgusted with the state of the game to bother logging on the my higher level alt to check the other dungeons.But as usual, the character models, attacks, specializations, and effects are still pretty awsome.HOWEVER.This game is far from the fantasy MMO it was when i first picked it up. If anything it is more of a hack n slash PVP game. Literally PVP is the only redeeming thing left in this game, and to PVP decently you have to level.All of the basic fundamentals of what used to make this game great for some reason have been made exclusive to high levels or people nearing the level cap, leaving little rewarding content for the rest of the majority of the game. This has caused many people to abandon the game all together, and i've definitely noticed a decrease in the number of players.In it's current state I would absolutely not reccomend this game.			"

												Great game to immerse yourself in and see massive amounts of character development. PvE doesn't become grindy, every couple of levels there is another nest and gear set to get, and you consistently become stronger. Also great to play with friends or pick a class that is great at soloing. Either way, an enjoyable experience with hours upon hours gameplay.I havent played very many mmos ive tryed alot but this is by far prob the best one ive played. What I like About The Game1:Fast Action Combat2:Cool Combos And Ability3:Alot Of Different Armor Weapons Ect4:It Isnt P2W From What Ive Seen5:It is playedable and enjoyable even while playing solo.What I Disliked About The Game1:There are some quests that litterally make you go from 1 NPC on one side of the town and back like 10 times.2:The Missions get sometimes repetitive. 3:For Not playing very many MMOs the menus ect are still kinda confusing 4:The Game Doesnt explain everything really well you have to learn alot of things by yourself and finding quest (finding)5:You need to grind sometimes for a long time to level up to do the main quest (Its not bad just something i dislike)(I have 98 hours in the game in 65 day so i do have much experience but in game time ive played decent bit for 1 day...)KEEP IN MIND THIS IS MY OPINION.You can agree Or Disagree. We all have are own opinions.Also Sorry for bad spelling ect I didnt take much time to check my spelling and I Did Caps Like This some places but Not Others lol.			"

												For a FTP game, this mmorpg has the capabilities to compete with games such as Destiny and Warframe. Can get a bit boring when you are playing on your own but playing with your friends to complete a certain goal produces a great feeling. The community isn't as bad as some people may say (I havent been playing for a long time though so Idk). Overall, Dragon Nest is the game that is ALL MOST A CARBON COPY OF LOG HORIZON. Which is very cool.Maybe they could copy the anime's idea of using abandoned Japan as a map. Maybe Dragon Nest could change the map by  region.			"

												Really love this game, I highly recommend it to anyone who has had bad community experiences from other big MMORPGs. The community is quite the best I have ever seen, very many helpful players and guilds, (Of course there are the bad apples in the basket!) and very willing to help anyone who needs it. Fun game, it's not exactly play-to-win if you don't want to buy anything. By far one of my most favorite games.			"

												This game is so fun and fast paced. I've played a lot of MMORPGs and Action MMOs but none have kept me coming back like this one. Leveling is fast, combat is fast, and as a result of those two things your ability to prevail is more dependent on skill than any other MMO I've played. PvE and PvP are both excellent. Only con I can think of is the key binding defaults are not good enough with a full skill bar, but allow me to negate that with my custom keybinds for the skill bar!Instead of 1234567890-= I use 1234QERTZXCV so that all my skills are within reach of WASDProblem solved!The transfer from Nexon finishes tonight at 10PM, I expect a lot of players will come for this event and I'm hoping with this review some more players will sign up!!In summary: best MMO I've played, period.PS I've played much more than 72 hours, but I didn't use the steam version previously so it didn't record all that.

												played it since beta test, loved it, thought it was the greatest mmo ever cuz of open non-targeting combat + anime graphics, then after the lvl40 level cap update things starting going downhill with ""balancing"" and ""bot-proofing"" updates making me drop the game after loving it for 3-4 years. every ""balancing"" update super boosted one class and basically nerfed all the rest and ""bot-proofing"" updates like gear farming was done by making mid-teir gear which always dropped in hardest difficulty of dungeons to small chance which overall hurt actual players than bots because it took A LOT more time to get decent gear for harder dungeons			"

												Dragon Nest does one thing, and it does it well: fast-paced action combat. The skills that you use in battle are visually spectacular, there are tons of cool combos you can pull off, and the dozens of playable classes ensure that you will not get bored quickly. If you can look past the outdated graphics and having to run the same dungeons multiple times, you will have a great time.			"

												Dragons Nest is an beat-em up MMORPG heavily focused with instances. It is NOT open-world. Played until level 21 with warrior class. Combat is a hit/miss for me though.7/10PROS:- Gameplay is fun and involved. 1-on-1 with bosses feel good. Dodging is somewhat required when you're in a even leveled field. - Cutscene animations are great and fluid.- Leveling up is relatively easy, with instance dungeons rewarding extra loot and gear.- You can solo all instances and continue the main quest with no problem.- Instances load quickly.- It's been F2P to level 21, so I assume it stays F2P onwards.CONS:- Another boring storyline. Girl gets kidnapped. Hoo boy what fun.- Environments are bland and boring. Few colors and textures.- Key bindings are static and cannot be changed.- For more hardcore players, this may be too easy.- NPC characters are forgettable.			"

												This game is actually very entertaining, however it's waaaaaay great to do a little bit of research on how to get gold in the game as for myself I struggled a lot x_x I had to use the ol' pay2win strat just to get by. Also I wouldn't quite reccomend playing it right now as it is sort of dead considering The game is getting transfered over to Eyedentity soon.But overall It is a fantastic game. It's fast paced action is really what makes it shine. It's graphics are not the best and its optimization certainly isn't the best either... But it's still a beautiful game in the aspect that it has some flashy moves and interesting character developement. And by that I mean you will be spending roughly $400 minimum to even get into any sort of raid party :D 7/10			"

												Dragon Nest is a gem among MMORPGs. The game sports an incredibly satisfying combat system that never gets dull whilst you slice and dice through thousands of mobs. I haven't played all of the classes yet, but the ones I have played are all equally entertaining and flashy. Hit up your weeb friends and play it with them because if you play alone you'll probably get sick and tired of grinding dungeons solo.

												Dragon Nest incorporates non-targeting system gameplay to create a fast paced action filled experience. Players choose from a range of hero classes, characters that are of the Dragon Nest storyline that can equip customizable gear and weapons. Characters exist in one world, Kalahan, which resulted from Nexon uniting all four worlds to unite the characters. Devastating skills can also be learned, to increase one's power when defeating monsters in instanced dungeons or defeating other players in PVP.Dragon Nest also has the advantage of being nearly completely skill-based, with lower level characters being able to defeat high level characters in PVP with skill alone. This allows a more experienced player that is of a lower level to dominate a less experienced player of a higher level player in PVP. I highly recommend Dragon Nest to all you hardcore players!			"

												So I am not quite sure what happened to this game in Nexon, did they sell the game to steam or something? The voice over definitely changed when I last played this game. Also I am not quite sure what the max level a character can go in this game. Last time I played it is 50 but apparently one of the gifts shows that I have to be 90+ to open the gift. Some of the contents are still in Korean, don't really know when they are going to fix that.Do I still recommend this game? Hell yea, despite the game is old and even blade and soul (which is released in 2012 as well) beats it by a mile, this is still a fun game with a lot of memories.I started playing this game once it was released, at the time it is still running by Nexon, and the max level was either 45 or 50 I can't remember. I was with a bunch of friends and it was definitely hella of fun back then. I quitted in the summer of 2013 because of some life changes, I haven't played it since then, at least in my memory because it does appear I have 5.5 hours of previous game play on the record.I played the game for couple hours yesterday, I found there are a few players in the game, of course it wasn't like the old days where tons of people were in the Carderock Pass, but seeing new players (or veteran players coming back) is definitely awesome. If you like a game that has a fun storyline, you probably want to find another game; however, if you like the kind of games that are simply fun to play, DN is okay. Or if your computer is kinda poopy on specs, DN is fine to play as well. My old laptop which was complete poop on the specs can still play the game with absolutely no problem.			"

It's got some pay to win elements, but mostly if you want to look cool or max your gear quickly and safely. PvP is somewhat broken, but it is ""balanced"" in that cash shop costumes have no effect in PvP. The level cap is just going up and up, and new content is always being added. Highly reccommended.

												I'll be short and clear with this game. (I played this before it came out of steam)Pro:-there is no problem hitting max level-fun action mechanic-Variety of nest out there (BUT you can't play them)Con:-People who says this game is ez or can run any dungeon solo without sweat... LOL the true fun comes when you actually get to solo nests, not a dungeon. unless you spent crazy amount of cash into this game like them most ppl can't even solo abyss level dungeons-Black dragon nest? watever nests that give you super rare item? you think you can run them by just joining any party group? dont even hope so. People with best gear only plays with people with same or slightly less gear. if you want to run that nest you will either have to pay them real money or so much gold to have 1 run together. all these people who've been playing since beta or watever are now acting all cocky and jerks. basically only way to get those legendary gear is to pay them, run the nest together, get part of gear (if you dont then too bad for you), pay them again for another run, you repeat this until u get all ur gears. Those nests up there aren't for everyone.			"

												I'm very fond of this RPG. The combat: exciting, soft, and fluid, yet still leaves me seeing the skill involved when executing my abilties in seamless succession. Equally as exciting as the combat [I've come to find out] is the dialouge.  Humor takes up a sizable spot to keep me smiling. Some scripts I re-read cause they were so amusing.  I don't have alot of hours in this RPG. But I'll log it to keep you and myself reminded- This is an RPG to stick around for. I wasn't sure when I read a review of someone saying, ""The longer you play the better it gets."" Doesn't that go with just about any game? But he was right.  This artstyle, and -this may sound weird, but the running avatar running animations, it just looked a little ""weird"" to me. But weird is simply something I'm just not use to seeing. I've sincerly grown to appreciate what Eyedentity Studios did and see why they did it.  The first day I played this game I knew it had potential, but I wasn't really impressed buy the standards I've been use to for so long.  Same games over and over by different companies had left me subconciously tunnel minded.  This game pryed it back open to how I remember MMORPG's and games being alike. Unique.I wrote this review at 15hours and I'm currently level 32. That being said; the sense of adventure to be had, and fun, isn't nearly over for me.  If a reader will take anything from this review then take this:Stick around and you will not regret it. I promise.			"

												Man oh man... I used to play this a lot... Note my hours (and thats just on steam - DN wasn't always available on the steam client). Definitely still has some of the best and most fluid, fast paced action oriented combat you'll find in ANY MMO, however the community has died down and this one is on its last leg. Now don't get me wrong, its still very fun to play and they've recently switched publishers from NEXON back to the original game developers, tbh I haven't touched it in a while and it kind of died on me. I had a great guild, great friend (whom I still talk to to this day) and a great time in PvP - to be honest I now find myself searching for a newer game to hold my interest like this one did and I still haven't quite found that. So it holds an irreplacable spot in my heart and its definitely a great game! I encourage people to try it casually, though its not really as hardcore as it used to be. I could go into technicalities all day but that'll take a book. Been playing since beta days and now its time to quit. Good luck all!			"

												I will preface this with the TL;DR: I love this game because of the story and the beautiful characters and playability, not because of other players. 4.5/5 stars!Most MMOs come with the near-requirement to have other players helping you. You need a party to take on the swarms of evil. Not so much with DN; If you play smart and don't get too in over your head, you can almost play the entire game without having to join another player. But definitely bring them for Nests and events and raids.Pros:-Good, creative story with fun, if not overly unique, twists and turns. Avoids being too edgy or trying too hard to be funny.-Varying classes with cool customizations. Nothing overly flashy, but weapons look cool and skills are big.-Bright world with varying environments, many enemies to mow down, and wild bosses to fight.-SOLO PLAYER CAPABLE!!! So long as you pace yourself and invest in skills and timing enough, you can 100% solo the majority of the game and not have to rely on other players!Cons:-The story has some obvious twists, and there is a constant up-down with emotions (if you invest in the characters).-The Lassie effect is horrible. You are told how you react, rather than reacting for yourself.-Some NPC that are unbearable stick around WAY too long.-Some of the class stories are confusing and only add questions, instead of answer them, over time.

												I've first started in 24 cap and no matter how many times I say to myself that I'll never play again, I keep coming back.  My steam hours truly do not reflect how much time I actually spent on this game.I'm sorry, but this game's combat is just so unique that I can't help but always come back to taste it over and over and over and over again until I get sick and tired of it, and still come back to it.I was so deep into the PvP scene that the game's SA and SA break values, the iframes, the CDs of other classes and how to counterplay each and every ability in the game from cap to cap... it's gross how much I know about this game, but I honestly don't regret a moment of it.All I can really say at this point is...#BringBackReleaseTinkerer10/10 would one shot Pallys with g0 again			"

												I really liked playing this game. I first started playing during the open beta with a couple of friends, and we enjoyed the whole concept of it. The game has a fun, entertaining combat system where every move has a combo and the special effects the moves do look cool. Each character had a unique storyline which gives it a refreshing feel if you want to ever start fresh.			"

												This is one awesome game.Edit: I use to find this game awesome. There was a patch some time ago i dont know when but made the game a complete grind instead of allowing us to do just abyss mode. now its ether 'normal or easy'. I have more than this many hours in the game. most of it was played off steam.			"

												After playing 70.5 hours on this, I guess you could say it was very enjoying. Whether with party or solo, the game is fun, and once you start to get into it you'll feel as if time passes by faster than usual. Learning the mechanics of this game is also quite easy to grasp. The world of it is very enjoyable. I would recommend this for those just looking to play a fun game.			"
