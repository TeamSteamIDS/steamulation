												Quake is a masterpiece, plain and simple.Quake may be one of my favorite games, but I'll try to make this review as unbiased as possible. Created in 1996, Quake was revolutionary at the time. Following after Doom (Both created by the wonderful ID Software), Quake took all of what Doom did right and pushed it into the third dimension. The levels, music, and enemies all go beyond the call of duty and make this game a timeless classic.Quake is heavily inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft, creating a dark and medieval setting. The dark shades of brown, green and bright reds in later levels really play to this note. This is not just to play homage to Lovecraft, but it doubles up as a way to put the player into an uneasy, unfamiliar, and terrifying world. Playing the game in linear order allows you to slowly creep into these unfamiliar waters. The levels are easy to commute, and allow for minor exploration to find secrets and health/ammo packs. When you run into a group of enemies, you rarely feel unprepared. That's not saying that this game is easy, because it'll tear you a new one if you don't watch out. This game isn't about unfairly pairing you with hard enemies; it’s about a gradual learning curve that teaches you to manage ammo, health and enemies. The enemies in Quake are also inspired by Lovecraft's novels. Otherworldly beings with a cameo appearance by the “Lord of the Wood” are just a sampler of what you are in store for. Like I touched on in my levels section, the enemies never feel too tough to beat. The first enemies you'll face are dogs and soldiers, gradually building up to Fiends, Shamblers, and Spawns (Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ these guys). You are introduced to new weapons semi-regularly, and are given a good amount of time to find out what to use on the different enemies. An example (and quick tip) are the Zombies. You can mow the Zombies down with your shotgun, but after awhile they will stand back up to fight. Then how do you kill them? When the level first starts you are given a grenade launcher. The first enemies you see? Zombies. With this new weapon already ready to fire, you unload on the group to find that you gib (kill) the zombies for good. From that point on you know how to dispose of them, and that you shouldn't waste your grenades on enemies other than zombies (with an exception for tougher enemies).With this dark fantasy world coming together with the level design and enemies, there's one last piece missing. Music. The music in Quake was composed by Nine-Inch-Nails. I'm not sure that I can say much else than that. The music fits the game perfectly with eerie, yet appropriate tracks. Take a look at the nail gun ammo boxes for a subtle nod.Nobody is perfect, and sadly this port isn't an exception to that rule. The Steam version of Quake comes without the classic Nine-Inch-Nails soundtrack, and the mouse is locked horizontally. This is quickly fixed however by downloading this fix from the community page -

All in all, Quake is worth the $10 price tag normally, but is an absolute steal during sales, dropping to around $5. The amazing level design, challenging enemies, and great music all come together to create one of video game histories greatest. Never think that you are finished playing Quake. While the main story may have been finished, the lively modding community is doing its job to keep Quake alive. Brand new stories, fun game modes (Team Fortress 2 has roots set in Quake), and many more changes make this game that keeps on giving. I cannot recommend this game more, you'll have to try it for yourself.			"

												The early 90s was an interesting time for the FPS genre. The game most often given the title of the original first person shooter is Wolfenstein 3D, released in May of 1992 by id Software. This FPS is extremely primitive by today's standards, consisting of mostly barren environments with many repetitive sprites, but it left a strong impression on the gaming world as being an innovative and exciting game that made you feel like you were a soldier directly killing Nazis. Only eighteen months later, in December of 1993, id Software would revolutionize the gaming world with the quintessential DOOM, a much more detailed, aggressive, and yet comedic game than id's previous game. DOOM quickly became a beloved classic and was one of the most important, if not THE most important FPS of the 90s because of its refined controls, weapon variety, unique environments, hellish setting, memorable music, comedic value, and bright, cartoonish, characteristic and instantly recognizable art style. DOOM may have been gorier and superficially darker than W3D, but the game itself was quite bright and retained a simplistic manner that was palettable to audiences worldwide. Less than a year later, id Software released DOOM 2: Hell on Earth, a stylistically very similar game to its initial DOOM release, albeit with some graphical enhancements. The setting and weapons were similar and the game maintained its predecessor's cartoonish look and feel. There weren't many noticeable differences between the original game and its sequel, save for much better multiplayer and refinements to the original game.Then, in June 1996, id Software released Quake. This game changed nearly everything from the DOOM playstyle. The gameplay was faster. Enemies were more nightmarish and unpredictable. The game used a 3D engine so the game actually gave the player a sense of depth and weight. The setting was dark, foreboding, and more in line with horror. The light/darkness was closer to depicting reality than a cartoon. Quake marked a definitive split from earlier ventures into the FPS genre by giving the player a sense of fear, urgency, and panic. Dark, unrelenting, and frightening for the time, this game took everything comedic from the DOOM franchise (since the series was goofy, silly, and didn't take itself that seriously) and reversed it. It added an actual atmosphere and made a tonal shift from light-hearted goofiness to the grittiness of a biting underworld. As with DOOM and W3D, the goal of Quake is usually to find a key to open up a passage to progress in order to find another key to open up a new area to find yet another key. Yet the enemy placement, labyrinthine level design, and brutal gameplay keeps this seemingly repetitive task from becoming stale. Every section is different and you'll often have the challenge of simply figuring out where to go, what to do, and how to deal with the enemies you're faced with without dying. Sure, DOOM presented some challenges but the enemies always stood out from the environment and had simple-to-memorize patterns, and you generally had enough space to strafe to avoid enemy projectiles. Quake changed this by making the environments more confined (or feel more confined), the level design less straightforward, and enemies don't stand out as much and behave somewhat unpredictably or in ways that can be frustrating to counter. Quake is a fantastic model for how games SHOULD be made: challenging, maintaining a consistent and clear tone, requiring players to think, and never being unfair.After Quake, id Software could never again recapture the intensity or ferocity of this gem. Quake II (1997) was, to me, a huge slap in the face, as it replaced the dark and serious tone of Quake with a silly, cartoonish, and completely out of place space marine story. In fact, the game itself was conceived as an entirely unrelated game, but because of the success of Quake, id decided to just make it a part of the series. To be honest, I never played Quake III until recently but since it was multiplayer-driven, I don't really include it as part of the series (if you want my opinion it just seems like a poor man's version of Unreal Tournament). Quake 4 was absolute trash and DOOM 3 was a major disappointment. I haven't tried id's most recent game, Rage, but I'm told it's incredibly buggy and just overall unpolished and derivative. It just goes to show not only that Quake was id Software's last great game, but that they truly lost something in their image of what their games should be like, instead going for bigger guns and more explosions and scripted events instead of heart-pounding dread and fast and furious gameplay.This game contains something that id could never again recapture. Quake for me will always be about pure aggression, pure violence, pure intensity, and in its essence is the pure FPS. It may feel somewhat clunky nowadays (you will need to change things around in the settings if you've played any FPS's in the last 15 years), and the enemies aren't the most detailed (okay, they're downright ugly by today's standards) but in practice you will see that it is one of the most refined games, fusing fast and unforgiving gameplay with a dark and chilling atmosphere. In my personal list of top FPS games, it ranks at number 4 behind (1) Aliens versus Predator 99/Gold Edition, (2) Half-Life, and (3) Unreal Tournament.The best word to me that sums up Quake is intense. It is a fantastic game that, while perhaps not the most innovative game of the 90s, is beyond a shadow of a doubt one of the most important. It helped to shape other FPS's to come in the late 90s, the glory years of the genre, which would come to a sad and ignominious end at the turn of the millennium.			"

												The game itself gets all thumbs up, it's a true classic and one of the best games of all time. You don't get this sort of frenzied action and complex level design anymore, and it's wonderfully dark and gloomy.The soundtrack, made by Nine Inch Nails in the Downward Spiral era, is absolutely fantastic, one of the best soundtracks of all time, incredibly dark and eerie. The graphics look outdated to say the least, but that CD soundtrack didn't age a day, quite the contrary. Alone, the game's darkness can't really impress anymore, but with the soundtrack it really comes to life.And there's the problem. This Steam version comes without the soundtrack. It doesn't even have any. Selling Quake without its epic soundtrack is ridiculous, because it's such an important part of it. I haven't seen any well visible warning on the store page that informs you about this, so it's borderline fraud.There seem to be workarounds if you are willing to download it from the internet (probably illegal). But the as-is version sold here gets a BIG thumbs down.			"

												Review at A GlancePros:Grand-daddy of full 3D First Person ShootersGripping, visceral, atmospheric soundtrackInventive, diverse level and enemy design (Lovecraftian)Addictive multiplayer gameplay, with myriad iterations/mods; alive to this dayUnparalleled, dark, medieval, ghoulish atmosphereCons:So many Source Ports and MODS, which ones to choose?!!?****Steam version does not include the game's original Soundtrack, easy online fix available****Conclusion:Essential gaming for fans of First Person Shooters; cemented the id Software legend. Most popular game engine of its time. If you don't have this already, what are you waiting for?! For current generation play, I recommend one of the common source ports, such as Ultimate Quake (DarkPlaces+).In-depth review, not for the faint of heart: ""Abandon all hope, ye who enter here"":1996. DooM had introduced ""Deathmatch"" to the popular lexicon three years earlier. id Software managed to capitalize on the addictive nature of online multiplay, while advancing the technical limits of FPS gaming. What followed was the most popular game engine of its time, and it revolutionized online multiplay. Engine novelties included polygonal models, fully 3D environments, easy tools for Game Modding and hardware 3D acceleration. Quake may single handedly be the game that made a cutting-edge graphics card an essential component for the modern PC gamer. Unique gameplay features included bunny hopping and rocket-jumping. Game emphasis was on the online, multiplayer experience, utilizing a client-server model rather than peer to peer, the preeminent model of the time. This model allowed players to create and mantain a session, while additional players would be able to join or leave at any time, without disrupting the game. Story: BAHAHAHAHAHAH!! Story?! Pffffftt. Don't let it get in the way of an epic, legendary, awesome FPS game. Beat the 4 episodes and collect the rune at the end, solve environmental puzzles, kill everything with a pulse...or rather, that moves! 'Nuff Said. There is something resembling a story that was thrown in to provide the semblance of a gaming thread.Gameplay:Fast paced, bunny hopping, rocket jumpin' non-stop, edge of your seat, deathmatchin' action. Gameplay intuitive enough to allow a beginner to jump in and start fraggin', yet, complex enough to allow a bustlin' pro scene to develop, and spawn a successful franchise. Responsive controls allow you to float through inspired levels and maneuver your character, even when airborne! Weapon selection established the standard with a good variety of now conventional, classic weapons; including the revered Shotgun, the seminal Rocket Launcher and the mighty Lighting Gun. Weapon balance and choice, depending on level design and range of combat, had never been this intricate.Design: Iconic palette hard on black/browns with excellent use of lighting and shadows for emphasis and scares. Weapon design is a bit blocky, by today's standards, but sits nicely with the dark, medieval theme. Enemy/monster designs are inventive, with great variety, and a multitude of baddies that attack from above, at ground level and in the water. At the time, probably the only other big title that offered hazards with such a degree of freedom of movement was ""Descent.""  Enemies appear as something out of a medieval demonic nightmare with a hodgepodge of humanoid, hellish Lovecraftian creatures coming at you and wielding a good array of weapons and attacks. The color palette and enemy design allows for baddies to pop out of dark corners and portions of the level, setting up multiple scares, providing a racemic mixture of action and horror that is hard to match.The level design, with its gothic architecture and variety of environmental puzzles and hazards, resulted in classic levels that would eventually be ported to multiple other engines and games. Sound: Immaculate, crisp environmental, creature, character and weapon sound effects that were mostly concocted/mixed in-house by the talented id crew utilizing innovative techniques and processing. Trent Reznor/NIN soundtrack provides a chilling backdrop with industrial, ambiental brilliance that peppers the game with a pumping, blood curling soundtrack, which seamlessly potentiates the dark visuals and sound effects.Replayability: The online multiplayer experience is at the core of Quake. It would offer more options than any other FPS at the time and, out of the box, would allow for Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Cooperative Play. It would also allow for Time and/or Frag limits. After some time, popular free modifications included Team Fortress and Capture the Flag modes. The transition to a Client:Server model would permit a server to run continuously and for players to drop in and pop out of the game, without interrupting it. This dramatically improved the chances of finding a working game. Moreover, whereas most multiplayer experiences at the time emphasized 1:1 or games of up to 8 players, Quake allowed up to 16 simultaneous players in its original iteration; resulting in unprecedented chaos and murderous destruction.Conclusion: Quake is a legendary, classic game from FPS greats, id Software (id Tech 2). The Quake engine fueled the upcoming games for a generation and set the blueprint for FPS and online gaming. Dark atmosphere with ghoulish, sadistic enemy design set in a medieval, gothic world full of environmental dangers and light puzzles. Online experience is the core of the game, and would shape the FPS landscape for the foreseeable future. If you enjoy FPS, horror, inventive level design, Lovecraftian creatures, NIN/Trent Reznor or are just interested in gaming history, you cannot go wrong with this game.			"

												Quake is the legendary old-school first person shooter from ID Software that was a step up from Doom as a true 3D game. The controls are simple, move, strafe, shoot, jump and change weapons. It is fast paced and you can strafe avoid most everything, so if you get hit, its your own fault. Because this is such a fast paced game, gone is the use button, instead you'll walk up to a button or a door and automatically interact with it.As a shooter, Quake features a lot of guns such as double barreled shotguns, various versions of nail guns (machine guns), grenade and rocket launchers. The weapons feel nice and have great impact, everything from making an enemy fall backward to gib explosions everywhere! There are no throwable grenades or alt fire, but the weapons feel so good to use you won't need them.You'll need the diverse array of weapons to take on an army of enemies in every level. Everything from standard soldiers and attack dogs to grenade launching chainsaw wielders and electric shocking giant yetis. There is a diverse array of enemies, that always keeps ramping up the challenge and tactics you'll need to kill them. The enemies will fight against one another, which is fun to see, but there aren't factions that you'll see intentionally compete against each other, but Quake still boils down to you vs everything else.The levels are expertly designed, but can be overly brown, but I guess a game named Quake makes me think inner earth and inner earth makes me think brown. Each level will have you going up, down, forward, opening doors, finding keys, falling in traps, jumping over lava, finding secrets, swimming through ugly water, dodging enemies and murdering much more. It is not straight forward, but you won't get lost, because it is well designed. There are four episodes with 8 or so levels each. Not just that, but because this game is so old and was so wildly popular, it has a million mods and levels.For new players, there is no regenerating health, but health and ammo are abundant, this is an action game. Kill an enemy, get rewarded with ammo. There is also armor that will let you take more damage.The music was performed or designed by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and feels like a touch of ambiance amongst scratch guitars. The nail gun ammo also has NIN logos.The Steam version of Quake offers QuakeWorld compatibility, but the big problem with that is QuakeWorld uses GameSpy servers, which were shut down. There are no achievements, but it is still a classic game that holds up today as one of the greatest old-school first person shooters.In all this is a fantastic game that uses a game engine that spawned dozens of other engines.

												Legendary game. One of the most satisfying shooters ever and the birth of online gaming. Very atmospheric and creepy at times thanks to the great soundtrack by Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails) which Steam does NOT provide. You can download it here[www.quaddicted.com] and use a source port that will play and loop the music files as intended.20 years later the community continues to create impressive, high quality content (single player maps) which will give you hundreds of additional hours of gameplay. No HD patches needed; Quake aged like a fine wine and looks great in all its glorious square pixels at 1080p. Just skim through my screenshots and see for yourself.There's nothing quite like Quake.

												*Disclaimer: I have HUNDREDS, if not THOUSANDS of hours with this game outside of steam*So what is quake? Quake was, and in my opinion, still is a benchmark of what a  good  absolutely amazing game should be. And that benchmark doesn't only aply to the FPS genre, but all games.When this game first came out, there was a demo for it. (That's a sample of a game that lets you try it out for free to know if you like it). Only quake didn't do what most games do now. Firstly, It HAD a demo, and it was non-restrictive. No time limit, nothing. You didn't get the whole game of cource, but you got ONE QUARTER of it! That's better than the one dinky level you get to play with in modern game demos. Or the $4.99 you have to pay for a...sports game demo. *Cough* EA *Cough*.Its this kind of commitment to giving the customer a great experience that contributes to Quake's general awesome factor.This game came out before Triple A companies were pandering to people with... How should I put it... Less than adequate skills to beat a level. If you chose a hard difficulty, the game let you know, by PUNCHING YOU IN THE FACE if you were inept enough to shoot yourself in the face with a rocket, or give a Shambler a bear hug. Quake asks the question ""What's regenerative health? You messed up and had yourself a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ripped by a demon? Tough luck bud, you're gonna play though the next two minutes with ONE helth!"" This game made you feel like you actually acomplished something if you beat it on the harder difficulties. If you played through on easy, yah you beat it, but you can't look someone in the eye and say ""I beat quake"". You have to beat it on HARD...or NIGHTMARE. In fact, only the worthy Quakers could beat the game on nightmare mode because they hid it. That's right. They didn't want people smashing their computer screens because they thought they were home free with 49/50 kills, only to be mucked by a fiend.There was more to this game, and more though put into it in 1996 than there is in a lot of big budget games of today. The levels weren't linear and you weren't forced to do anything, because that's stupid...STUPID!. I lookin' at you Call of Duty. All Quake did was say ""Hey. You see that level there? There's an exit somewhere in there. If you find it, you beat the level."" Then Quake patted you on the head, and let yo go on your merry way. There was no loud messages says ""PICK UP THE GUNS AND SHOOT THAT ONE SPECIFIC GUY!"". You could run though the levels dodging all the enemies and picking literally nothing up, although I speak from experience when I say that does NOT work on harder difficulty levels.Quake has a lot of replay value. Mostly because unless you go down the scrub road and watch a walk through so you can brag ""I got 100% completion on Quake on my frist play though!"", then you're gonna miss stuff, such as secrets. Hell, sometimes even I forget to walk through that one window that looks slightly different than all the rest. But when you DO get all secrets and all kills on all four episodes (yes there are four), each of which contains 7 levels (not including the SECRET FREAKIN LEVELS), then you have won not only Quake, but life itself. Quake doesn't have achievements because it doesn't need them, because when you tell osmeone you got 100% on Quake on NIGHTMARE mode, they believe you. Because one does not simply lie about gett 100% on nightmare mode on Quake. Besides, if you want to play Quake for achievements, you're playin' it for the wrong reason.Let's quickly talk about the story of Quake. There's not really a story to Quake, aside from a dinky little .txt file. That's because Quake IS the story. If somebody asks me what the story line of 'That old ♥♥♥ game' I'm playing is, I yell in a very peculiar voice ""QUAKE. That's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ story!""The enemies in Quake are amazing. They show no mercy. They don't have some stupid weak spot for you to shoot while they stand still for 10 seconds. Oh no. If you're low on ammo, and you see a Shambler, you don't simply try and kill it. You have two choises. Run, fast, in as straight a line as possible to ammo, and to health because you had half of it zapped straigh out of you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, or you climb to the tallest tower that's convenient, jump off, and restart the level, this time not being so dumb as to forget to pick up that pack of ammo. If you're looking for epic climactic (hehe, that's a double entendre) boss fights, then you might be disappointed with Quake. There's two of them if you really want to call them that, but again, if you're playing Quake for boss fights, you're playing it wrong. Quake is about fighting through hoards of ememies that on their own may not put up a huge fight (although most of them could single handedly rip off your face while reading shakespear), when you have 10 grenades flying at your face at the same time as your testies are being gnawed off by demond fishies, you health goes from 100 to squichy mush pile status real fast.Sound design is something that Triple A companies like to talk about a lot, but then they often end up goofing it up, providing me with a symphony of mushy repeating sounds. Quake isn't like that. The ambiant noise is actually scary sometimes. Not spooky... Scary. They sound track is bang on. People often ♥♥♥♥♥ that the Steam version's sound track doesn't work. It doesn't work 'right out of the box' so to speak, but give the game a break. Its running on an operating system SIX..count 'em...SIX generations newer than it was designed to do. That game was made in '96 and its 2016. The ♥♥♥♥in' game's onlder than I am, and I can't play that sound track either. But I digress. The sound track works fine with a few little tweaks, and its amazing.Multiplayer is also something that is, or rather I should say 'should' be important today. It was important for Quake though. Over the years, there have been many MANY Quake tournaments. And they're still going on. There were no official dedicated quake servers, but there are dozens that you can connect to that have been running since '96. Have you got ANY idea how amazing it is that there are still multiplayer servers with people on them? Codemasters shut down all their Race Driver Grid servers two years ago for whatever new game they were releasing at the time, which nobody played online anyway. The Quake community does it RIGHT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it.In 1996 people loved to mod Quake. Today, there is still a huge modding community (where's our gaddamn steamworks!?). You can play Quake in a client that can make it look comparable to some modern games (and no I'm not talking Minecraft or Clash of Clans graphics either. Proper graphics from today). And your not going to have some dickweed company try and ban you for enhancing graphics. Also, this game is DRM free, because DRM wasn't a thing in 1996, and thank ♥♥♥♥ that Steam or ID didn't try to empose some form of BS DRM on the Steam version of Quake. When I buy a game, and give somebody my money for their game, I don't wana have them check in on me every half our to see if I'm doing 'illegal ♥♥♥♥' with my game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥IT! *Clears throat* Anywho, you can get countless mods and maps (some with stories too!) from a bunch of different websites over this magical thing called the internet. And the game wasn't built to reject mods because they didn't want you to 'tamper' with their baby...*Cough* Rockstar *Cough*In conclusion, this game is WAY beyond amazing. No joke, I give this game 10/10. This may be the best game ever made.Remember this. Whether or not you know it or not, you love Quake. And Quake loves you... In a rip you face of and make you restart the level because this game is not for the weak of heart and doesn't have stupid annoying auto save and you forgot to save your progress kind of way.			"

												If you loved DOOM or DOOM II then Quake is a god-send. The Original Quake was THE FIRST TRUE 3D First Person Shooter ever made. And it did (then as well as now, if anyone could see past then next CoD) phenominally. 32 is the magic number when it comes to great FPS' , as all 32 levels (and 6 underplayed 'Deathmatch' levels) were intense and enjoyable from start to finish.    The Original Quake may as well have been a DOOM spin-off during it's initial release, but copying a great formula isn't always a bad thing, IF you know where to go with it. Quake knew EXACTLY what it was doing, and IMPROVED upon all of DOOM's previous work. Taking DOOM 2's 32 level formula, the ability to look up and down (It was REVOLUTIONARY I TELL YOU!!!!!!!), intense gore (which, back then made the game ""M for Mature"" but now, with graphical updates, the gore has been downgraded too ""T for Teen""), fast-paced (CoD has NOTHING on this) multiplayer, and over the top violence (A.K.A. The AXE OF EXPLOSIONS, seriously... no joke... go smash up a corpse with this thing...), that made it a 'Must have' for EVERY gamer that owned Windows 95.     NOTICE (FOR CLARIFICATION ONLY, You can skip this if you want):Now, I must clarify one thing, I didn't grow up on DOOM or DOOM II or even Quake, BUT I believe Wolfenstein, Spear of Destiny, DOOM, DOOM II, Quake, and all of the other great 90's First Person Shooters are what we should all take a page from when making the next CoD. SERIOUSLY my first First Person Shooter was CALL OF DUTY 4 for God's sake! When I played DOOM for the first time I was... how shall I say this....MIND BLOWN, FLOORED, & BLOWN THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR! SERIOUSLY! I play CoD 4 now and I'll ALWAYS go back to DOOM & DOOM II before the day's up.     The Original Quake is, in my opinion, better than Quake 2 & 4 (Which are basically part of a 'mini-trilogy' I call ""The Quake Wars""), Quake 1 is entirely seperate from the rest of the series. It is closer to a fully 3D DOOM game more than Quake's 2, 4, and Enemy Territory: Quake Wars (A.K.A The Quake Wars Trilogy)  Quake is the name of the final Boss in this game, though (Can this really be a spoiler? I mean, all I said was the name, right?) not a boss in The Quake Wars Trilogy, has no mention of even the name ""Quake"" EXCEPT when the Intro of Enemy Territory: QW has a slip-gate (pretty much a space teleporter) shaped like the logo summon invading ships.     NOW, all mentions of other games aside.... Quake is an addicting, fast paced, rocket jumping (yes, we has those), barrel O' fun. In the words of a wiseman ~ ""In my day, we rocket jumped to school, both ways."" - Wise guy, 20XX (because I don't remember his name or the year). You would be a FOOL to pass this game up, give it a try, there's NOTHING to lose, and everything to GAIN!P.S. It is ALMOST REQUIRED to have this installed onto the game to make run properly on modern PC's:  http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1756923 (The ULTIMATE Quake Patch IS LITTERALLY the 'Best Thing Since Rocket Jumps')			"

												The first-person shooter genre is built on the backs of giants, and few are as big as the Quake series. It was the first fully-3D shooter success story and helped kick the online multiplayer scene into overdrive. We're a long way out from the golden age of iD Software, but their titles have incredible staying power thanks to solid fundamentals and vibrant modding scenes. The original Quake is no exception, but as I'll explain, you may want to consider your options before picking up this particular version.Quake technically has a plot, but it was literally one type-written page in the jewelcase-insert manual. Government makes portal thingies, demon thingies come out of portals, you kill demons with gun thingies. In practice this means four episodes of gruesome treks into ruined bases, medieval castles, nonsensical hellmazes, and twisting eldritch architecture. There are a lot of elements to laud about Quake but the one I'm really going to harp on is the feel of it, because it's one of the best cosmic horror FPSes to date outside of the literal Lovecraftian ones like Call of Cthulhu and Eldritch. Levels are tightly-designed labyrinths of decaying arches and gothic spires, impossible woodwork and ageless caverns. The modeling detail and texture work really drives home the atmosphere of ancient, neglected places full of unspeakable things, and the dated, chunky graphics actually help the unearthly feel.Then of course there are the unspeakable things trying to kill you. Quake features a refreshingly diverse cast of beings to forcibly disassemble, from corrupted marines to bloodthirsty knights, self-dismembering zombies to spider-legged horrors. The key here is that they cover the standard enemy roles in unusual ways, the Ogre being the prime example of this. One of the most common enemies in the game, he's armed with a heavily-damaging grenade launcher and an even nastier chainsaw. This wouldn't really fly in a lot of games, but the combination of high movespeed and effective weapon variety means you'll always have options in combating him and avoiding his brutal damage entirely.It's these player elements that make Quake feel like a bridge between Doom and the modern era. You avatar still darts around levels at inhuman speeds, allowing you to weave between foes to spark infighting or bait melee attacks. Your freedom of movement also lets you seek out the many secrets of every level, often hidden in ingenious ways. The weapons are a good spread of utility but without any real stand-outs like the BFG of old, giving you an effective if not exciting arsenal to dispatch your enemies with. There are some creative interactions, at least, like zombies only being killable with explosives, or the lightning gun killing you (and everything else) if used underwater.The ironclad fundamentals of Quake make it a timeless classic that still holds up to this day, even discounting the incredible multiplayer or soundtrack (an original Trent Reznor creation!). And you will need to discount those if you pick this version up, because they're not included. The Steam version of Quake lacks the CD soundtrack, and features four outdated executables for the game. Two of these are old Quakeworld multiplayer-only clients that are now defunct. The other two are ancient versions of winQuake designed for Win95 that may not run on your system at all. The unfortunate truth is that Quake might not work for you at all out of the proverbial box. There are plenty of source ports that WILL work if you download them, as long as you own the official game, but understand that modding may be your only option to enjoy what you're buying.In the end, what I'm saying here is that you should own Quake and you should play Quake, but this version isn't necessarily the best way to do that. A retro-friendly storefront like GOG is more likely to have one that will play without any fiddling, but all the same you should be prepared to mod Quake if you want the most out of it. I don't normally speak of modding in my reviews but this is one of the rare times it's a necessity, especially if you want to dip your toes in the multiplayer. I assure the hassle is worth it, because Quake formed the foundation of FPSes for good reason, and even now it's a unique and thrilling experience.			"

												I am not going to dispute the quality of Quake, as I personally believe that it is one of the finest First Person Shooters ever made.  I would also argue that the game still holds up today.What I am going to draw attention to is the simple fact that the version on sale on Steam does not have its soundtrack.  This is quite unnacceptable.  While you can get it back through mods the fact that this is necessary is an horrendous oversight that plainly should not be tolerated.  Arguably the soundtrack is a major draw if not the major draw to this game.  Great ambient work by Trent Reznor that sets the mood  as a perfect compliment for the level design and art design.  Without it, much of the atmosphere is lost, and much of what made it a special complete experience is lost.  There simply is no excuse for leaving this out.However, as I said, it is a fine game.  Even with that in mind, simply put we should demand better treatment for our classics than what we have on display here.			"

												This was the first game I ever played; not the pc version, but the very bad N64 port. It features great level design and a veriety of weapons. Have you ever used the ""Original"" rocket launcher in Tf2? It is actually the rocket launcher featured in Quake. It features many frightning enemies, dreams of running down a long corridor being chased by Shamblers still haunt me. The game was the first 3d FPS with acctual; 3d models ever made, and can rival then likes of Duke Nukem 3D. Those were my Compliments, now here are my complaints: 1. For those who do not like old graphics...well.. these haven't aged well.2. The game allways feels a little to short, I crave more levels.3.I personally feel the game should be 7$, but thats just me4. Again may be just me, but I allways had trouble with later levels even   on easy.Conclusion: I find that Quake is a nifty little gem that will eat up some of your free time.

												The music is missing from this version of quake 1 and 2(I haven’t tried 3 yet). When I buy something. I expect to get the complete experience. Especially when the product is this old.  I don’t mind tinkering around to get the game working as long as it is complete. But if the game is not complete and I need to find another source (the internet for example) to get the missing component. I cant really be ask to bothered with it. It’s like buying a puzzle. But you need to download(or by other means) to get the last couple of pieces. It is just frustratingly. On the up side the gameplay is excilent. As long if you like old nineties fps games.			"

												A must buy for anyone ever - Quake offers a frantic shooter experience like no other and stands among the best games ever created. id Software has once again pushed the limits of gaming and has harnessed the true power of PC's processing power. Quake's fully 3D rendered maps make you weep in joy as you make your way through the dark castle corridors and mansion cellars while spraying lead - or in this case Nine Inch Nails - to the brains of the undead while listening to the terrific ambient soundtrack composed by Trent Reznor.Oh, I recommend using the DarkPlaces Quake engine.

												I loved Quake back in the days and I still enjoy it today. There's no doubt this is a legendary game with near to perfect level design and gameplay, a lot of atmosphere and a huge legacy.But I can't recommend this package here on Steam. You are forced to install source ports like ProQuake 4 (http://quakeone.com/proquake/) to make it run properly. Because they actually have the balls to shove a supposedly unmodified version of WinQuake into your mouth that's just not working properly - at least for me. I am sorry but that is not what I expect when I buy a release of a game that's 20 years old. Not for 5 Euros or even 50 Cent. Not if you consider the source code is open for more then 10 years and there are tons of source ports, modifications etc. Just pick one for christ's sake and use that you greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.But the biggest letdown of all for me is that they didn't include the kickass soundtrack by Trent Reznor aka Ninch Inch Nails. Are you serious? Either they want to save download time or were they just too lazy to figure out how to playback the CD music. Again: must be one hell of a task considering the source code of Quake is available for more than ten years now.In the end, this is just sloppy, quick moneymaking. Some dudes at ZeniMax or Bethesda (did id belong to Bethesda in 2007 already?) probably thought: ""Let's shove out that Quake game my kids once talked about. Who cares if it runs. The stupid muppets will buy it anyway to have it in their so called 'Steam Library'. Let's make a buck or two without any effort! Ha ha."" Yeah, well, screw you, Corporate Commander.			"

												In honor of Quake's 20th birthday and Quake Champions announcement, I feel it's relevant to say how great this gem of a game has aged. As id's leap into 3D, and one of the first truly 3D polygonal shooters I can recall, Quake is still as much fun in 2016 as it was in 1996. The game oozes a dark, eeire and ominous atmosphere, with an interesting blend of gothic fantasy and gritty sci-fi for a really one of a kind look. The 3D graphics, though obviously very dated, are still rather charming. This is too speak nothing of Trent Reznor's fantastic soundtrack, which deeply enhances the creepy atmoshphere. If you enjoyed Doom 2016, this would be right up your alley. It makes me very happy to say how well Quake holds up.  "

												In the 1990s, the first-person shooter was still a new genre to many, and id Software were the kings of the genre. Starting by introducing many to the genre with Wolfenstein 3-D, id created a shooter that had the player running through a 3-D maze gunning down Nazis and killing Hitler, and it was really all people needed in 1992. The next year, id got a little more ambitious and unleashed Doom onto the world. Allowing players more weapons and adding a vertical axis to the game, Doom took gaming by storm, with gamers all too happy to dismember the armies of Hell and play with their friends online (it got so popular many offices had to install programs onto the computers that could prevent people from playing Doom deathmatches because so many people slacked off and went online fragging each other in deathmatch.) Doom got a sequel, which got two expansions endorsed but not made by id, and a collection of levels created by fans of the games were released. It seemed like id had peaked and that there was nowhere else for id to go from here. But then Quake happened.Quake again redefined what it meant to be a FPS and shocked the gaming world by adding a truly 3-D environment that was filled with all kinds of unique and varying types of enemies. With 4 episodes and 7 levels each, the game is smaller than Doom, but the gameplay is off the hook, balls-to-the-wall, rocket-jumping, grenade-hopping, MADNESS. There's a less overt evil you see in Quake compared to Doom, as these aren't just Demons from hell, they're inspired from H.P. Lovecraft, Edgar Allen Poe, and other classical horror works. While it's lacking in the epic-boss-encounter department, the game is more concerned with being a damn good shooter, and it certainly accomplishes that. I've been playing Doom and Wolfenstein for quite some time now, but Quake is better than both those games and I've only been playing it for about 3 hours, which is saying a lot because I've played over 500 hours of Doom (don't check the Steam hours, I use GZDoom.)If you like first person shooters, buy Quake. You'd be doing yourself a favor.			"

												I've been meaning to write this review earlier, but I know that no one in the world knows about this game.  Now with the achievements, I have an excuse to finally write this!Quake is id Software's first foray into a true 3D game, a first person shooter in the vein of Doom.  During it's debut, it was groundbreaking for its technological advancements, and is now well known for being the basis of some of video game's biggest hits, where they originally branched out of a Quake mod.Most remember it for its multiplayer, but few talk about how its single player campaign holds up.  Admittedly, the story is very anachronistic and shoehorned due to it being based off of an earlier build; Quake was slated to be an RPG in a dark fantasy world before id decided to turn it into an FPS, which is why you'll see a blend of futuristic weaponry mixed in with medieval backdrops and Lovecraftian-inspired monsters.  A lot of people will dismiss the graphics for running the ""Real is Brown"" trope to the ground, but I personally love it.  It adds to the atmosphere of the game along with the ambient music (wonderfully crafted by NiN) and truly lets you feel like you're alone in a desolate dimension.The gameplay is where it truly shines.  While it was always marketed for its (at the time) amazing visuals, not a lot of people payed heed to its amazing gunplay and well-crafted difficulty.  While the original game suffers from lack of customization, source ports more than help to enhance the overall experience.  The controls really feel tight and responsive, with the gunplay rivalling modern-era games with how all the guns have a real sort of ""punch"" to them (the Super Nailgun in particular is absolutely cathartic).  The difficulty is also very tough, but fair.  While it still falls under the usual usage of ""higher difficulty = enemies do more damage and you do less"", it isn't exaggerated like in a lot of other games.  I, myself, found the highest difficulty to be a good challenge.In all, I'd say this game has aged fairly well.  Whether it be my nostalgia goggles or not, I feel like the muddy graphics enhance the overall feel of the game's otherworldly tone.  The gameplay is as excellent as ever, and the sound design is truly phenomenal.  If you're a fan of FPS games and you're looking for another classic to play, I'd recommend this title to you, as well as the expansion packs with it.  While the multiplayer's pretty much dead (at least to my knowledge), it's worth it if only for the single player.			"

												The Revolution of Multiplayer Real-time games all started with this game that made it to the No.1 game of year 1996. Most Half-Life 1 mods are decended from it's Quake modified engine and this game rocks and will remain No.1 for many years to come and its sequels.The only thing you need to be aware is using +mlook and making a autoexec.cfg file to even the odds out and making gameplay less awkward. Also you will need to update and set your OpenGL extension limit on when playing this on GLQuake mode.

												Since I reviewed Quake II and Quake III Arena, I could not finished the Pre-DOOM 3 Quakes without including the legendary Quake! Let's start how I discovered it... On a typical trip to best buy in 1997, at the time, I grew up with macintosh than windows, we were looking for a new Mac game to buy and play, I discovered Quake, and looking through the back cover of the box, I felt scared of the screenshots in it. When I played it, I loved it, even the clever thing one time when I put the Warcraft II CD in, it would play Warcraft music!The game's final boss, monsters, and art style is primarily based the works of Howard Phillips Lovecraft, or better known as H.P. Lovecraft. And no, Cthulu isn't there, Shub-Nigath is there. Same gameplay as the other Quakes I mentioned were fun, fast-pace, and addicting.For the story, you are Ranger, a soldier who has investigate the incidents happened with a monster known as ""Quake"" (AKA Shub-Nigath). You are there to kill Vores that shoots energy that follows you, Powerful Death Knights, the tough to kill Shamblers, Zombies only killed by Explosives, Possessed Soldiers and Rottweilers, And the apprentience Knights. Yeah, even Quake 1 has enemy variety. It also has some iconic weapons, like the rocket launcher featured in Team Fortress 2 (AKA The Original) and Lightning gun, powerful yet consumes ammo fast! Aside from that, there is the Nailguns inspired by the band Nine Inch Nails. Yes! Trent Reznor, as a DOOM Fan, along with Nine Inch Nails, did the music and sounds for Quake.Totally get this game that revolutionizes the 3D world of gaming.P.S. I can't spell Shub's name right due to the censorship in steam reviewing, blame Valve, not me.			"

												+fun+looks insanely good in darkplaces with dynamic lighting enabled and GL_NEAREST(AMD Eyefinity doesn't produce awkward weapon positions in darkplaces!)+insanely good soundtrack-no music included on the steam release, (Thanks whats-left-of-id software!)-Neither Carmack OR Romero and a hell of a lot of others, including ALL of the original founders don't even work at id anymore, Zenimax/Methesda owns id now, so no reason to financially support id by buying new games.Just ask your friend for his CD he doesn't use anymore and move the paks to a darkplaces install.I really don't see a reason to buy a /new/ copy of Quake now other than for nerdcred.If you decide to play with darkplaces? I highly recommend you manually set the GL_TEXTUREMODE to GL_NEAREST.The crispier graphics that GL_NEAREST gives you over GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR (default) is definitely something I like in Quake. (Mind you, the setting doesn't stick for some reason, probably a bug in darkplaces)

Quake				* 7/10A game that represented a historical turning point for gaming.Quake is an FPS from iD software that followed Doom II. Its importance is mostly due to the technical evolution at the time of its release. Available both in software renderer and OpenGL renderer it allowed real 3d environments, items and enemies, advanced architecture (overlying floors, floating lifts, moving surfaces or floors...). Nowadays we take this for granted but for the time it was a real revolution especially the GL version that allowed a smoother graphic and a superior performance.Nowadays Quake's engine looks pretty old, with very low polys models and undefined blurry textures. Yet even nowadays there are many ports available with texture packs, improved renders and effects that allow to play this old classic with a 16:9 high resolution giving a great (and resource demanding) aesthetic experience, even though the game is over 20 years old.I wasn't forced to use those ports as the game luckily runs both with software and OpenGL render On my machine but the graphics is so old that I had to use an updated port to play (Personally I've used Darkplaces, you can see pictures in my galleries).Music score was composed by Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails and is made of environmental and instrumental quite heavy tracks. Unfortunately once again there's no soundtrack available in this steam release for no logical reason, luckily with ports and updates there are also packages available in the web that includes the full soundtrack for both the game and the expansions.Story is almost inexistent as in most old iD games, it's more like a context: You are a soldier or better, Ranger that has to save the earth from an alien, codename Quake, and his army that moves to places with portals named ""Slipgates"".What's more important then the story is the game's art, heavily inspired by medieval themes, so you will be exploring many locations with typical elements such as rose windows, mosaics, churches, castles, libraries, drawbridges. Even some enemies are knights with swords. Still this is an FPS so you have shotguns, chainguns (converted to nailguns, who knows why), rocket launchers and there are also enemies with chainguns, grenade launchers, ghosts, zombies, so this is not an accurate medieval reproduction but mostly just an artistic choice. +++PROs+++ FPS. This is the good old classic frantic FPS, with loads of enemies, weapons, secrets and more. Just run and shoot everything that moves and go ahead. Simple and fun.---CONs--- OLD. Quake is 20 years old as I'm writing and its age is really a visible issue. Even in GL Render models have a really low polycount and textures are barely detailed, not to mention the lack of mouselook support or 16:9 display compatibility. Luckily there are updated ports that can MASSIVELY improve the experience with new effects, lighting, textures pack, and new models (I've used Darkplaces, you can see pictures in my galleries). STEAM RELEASE. Even though there are no relevant compatibility issues, once again there's no music in this release (Same problem as in Quake 2). Luckily there are patches that bring it back both in Vanilla and Any other port release.I played this game on this machine:Laptop Lenovo Z50Intel Core i5-4210U8Gb RAM DDR3GeForce 840M/Intel HD Graphics 4400Windows 10 Home x64 "

												Id Software's Quake is the game that popularised online deathmatches. This first game in the Quake series is inspired by Gothic-style environments, medieval settings and Satanic imagery (similar to id's predecessor, Doom). It also has been the starting point and an influence on user mods, machinimas and speedruns.Thanks to Trent Reznor, founder/leading singer of Nine Inch Nails, his music and sound design/effects for the game added to the creepiness factor of the game, other members of the band contributed to the soundtrack as well. Though in order to get the soundtrack for the Steam version, you need the Ultimate Quake Patch.Quake is also the game that the original Team Fortress was based on by John Cook and Robin Walker (who are now working in Valve).Its singleplayer campaign consists of four episodes of eight levels each (including a secret level). You play a protaganist only known as Ranger sent into a portal to defeat an enemy codenamed Quake. As you collect weapons/items, they are carried over to the next level. The higher level you reach, the more challenging and intense it becomes than the last.			"

												Historical RootsThe year is 1996. The games industry had already been presented to games like DOOM and Wolfenstein 3D but Quake take the experience of first person shooters to another level. The Game inserts you into an environment full of darkness and fallen demonic beings – all of them willing to kill you, off course. You walk – or run –  by yourself through dark and scary corridors solving puzzles, pressing buttons, dodging bullets and escaping from traps. Each new area guards a new surprise and, most of the time, you going to fell relieve when you find the last portal and complete the stage. Why play Quake nowadays? It’s simple, no one could truly respect the FPS genre without knowing his history and his historical development process. To play Quake is a prior condition for anyone who wants to set himself up as a gamer. 21 years after his debut the game remains fun and challenging – try the nightmare difficult – the sounds are iconic and, of course, the gameplay is remarkable. There’s no present without history and there’s no history without the present. Just play. "

												There could not have been a better time for a game like Quake to be launched than its own. Feeding upon the virtues and vision of Doom and Doom II, it reaches even farther confines of first-person gameplay, something it excels at, even if  compared to games of the same genre from years later. It is outstanding how well this behemoth of 1990s shooters has aged, since its frantic and well-balanced action gives way to countless reruns should the player wish to have some more of the Quake elixir. That could be explained by its advanced mechanics - quick strafing, jumping, recoil, plurality of enemies and plurality of ways to face them, among other gameplay qualities. It could also be explained by its unparalleled level design, which may very well be the game's utmost asset. Here, names such as Tim Willits, John Romero, and American McGee spring to mind. Throughout Quake's four episodes, the player is challenged with labyrinthine keeps, gloomy catacombs, unforgettable halls... all of them filled with key areas that quickly swarm with just enough creatures to keep the protagonist busy and trigger-happy at all times. The bridges, narrow corridors, staircases, secret passages, underwater ruins, all respond to the player's arrival and can be revisited in punctual moments during the progression of the stage. Not to mention that each level has its own mechanisms of completion, often related to the acquisition of keys that open gates that give way to advanced rooms in the map. Never will a room, corridor, or any piece of game space feel redundant or undistinguished, as the game will give the player a purpose and leverage to keep progressing through the areas, using each level's singular rationale. Play maps like The Crypt of Decay (E2M3), The Vaults of Zin (E3M2), or The Wind Tunnels (E3M5), and have a wee glance at how memorable level design is here. Also multiplayer, still in its baby steps back then, provided great fun with maps like The Dark Zone (DM6). It is no Tokay's Tower, but it offers satisfactory deathmatch action.This Steam version comes with four different applications that will behave distinctly depending on the system being used (two of them dedicated to QuakeWorld). Some resolution and colour issues hinder the experience more often than not, which is why the player should make sure to search for optimisation mods and patches online, such as the extremely efficient Ultimate Quake Patch v1.11, which works in perfect unison with the GLQuake application.I find it nearly impossible not to value the game's momentous contributions to an almost perennial genre. It is unique in its techno-Gothic aesthetics and its veer towards an all-Lovecraftian story - with references spanning even post-Lovecraft Cthulhu Mythos bestiaries, such as the Chthonians - while staying simplistic and not bothering the player with plotline complexities, which is understandable, considering the forthrightness of old-time shooters when it comes to writing. It is heart-warming to notice that almost twenty years have not stained the delight of mouse-and-keyboard frenzy that Quake inspires.			"

												Quake's 20th anniversary is here and I started playing the singleplayer campaign again. I played Quake when it originally released and it still holds up today. Quake's legacy might be its multiplayer, but Quake 1's campaign is great. It's all about the creepy atmosphere. It's not a game where you quickly mow through legions of demonic creatures. It involves exploration and some minor puzzle solving (mostly just finding keys or pressing a panel to open a wall, etc). You're wandering around a dark, subterranean castle-like environment which is in stark contrast to the sci fi settings of the sequels. This is by far the best setting out of the Quake series and I wish they'd do a modern take on the original setting, instead of all the sci fi Strogg nonsense that came after it. None of them captured the eerie horror setting and atmosphere of the original which is a shame. There is a basic story and lore to the game you can read about, but its not really presented in the game. You don't need to read anything to enjoy the game though. Similar to how Doom had a basic plot, but the game itself just involves you navigating levels and shooting stuff.You must play this game with the Ultimate Quake Patch installed. It restores Trent Reznor's (of Nine Inch Nails) original soundtrack which was a creepy atmospheric masterpiece. To play the game without it is doing yourself a serious disservice. In addition to the soundtrack, it adds support for new resolutions. I personally don't think it needs any high res texture pack, playing it at a higher screen resolution is enough. It might look primitive by today's standards but id Software did a superb job with the limitations they had at the time.Multiplayer is all but dead. While servers still exist, good luck finding anybody to play with. I had loads of fun with the multiplayer when the game was new, the Headhunters mod was particularly entertaining. You're not going to be playing this game today for the multiplayer, but for its singleplayer where it really shines.			"

A Classic that still holds up today, and graphics mods make it even betterYea!-Classic FPS style with health/weapon pickups and no 2 weapon limit-Fast paced and fun-Gibs!-Level design you don't see at all today-Tons of Mods/levels out on the intranetsMeh!-Quite easy even on hardest difficulty as AI shows its age-Really needs to have Graphics mods to be enjoyable this day and age-Nice weapon selectionBleh!-Missing the NiN soundtrack that shipped with it back in the day-No save feature(unless i missed it somewhere) means you need to complete an act in one sitting to beat it--""edit I totally missed it the SAVE feature is listed under new game"" The Lowdown Quake is still a classic FPS that is still a blast to play today. Its fast paced requires quick aiming skills on later difficulties. The level design is top notch, which compared to todays corrider shooters which is quite sad we have evolved backwards due to the ADHD generation. While there are only 4 acts with a handful of levels each and no real story it can be a quick play for veterans of this era. But what makes up for it is there is tons of content out there for Quake so you basically have endless hours of content. Steam workdhop would be amazing if it was p[ossible.The graphics did not age  that well, along with the S#@% brown color palete will hurt your eyes. But this is quite easly fixed with a good number of graphics mods that make it on equal terms of todays indie games(Epsilon/Darkplaces). And last but not least be aware that the steam version is missing the NiN soundtrack that was on the release disk so long ago.Verdict:Buy It! "

												Best $3 I have ever spent on Steam hands down. Grew up playing DOOM I & II, so this game was a welcome refresher. Never played Quake before so its been great playing through all the cool custom map packs available. In my opinion, FPS level design has regressed quite a bit when you compare it to what Quake offers. This game is what FPS should strive to be.To avoid playing this game would be an incredible disservice only to yourself.			"

												I don't know what else there is to say about Quake that hasn't already been said.This is one of my favorite games of all time.If you played it in the past and enjoyed it, purchasing this classic FPS is a no brainer at $5.If you've never played quake, are a fan of first person shooters, and don't mind changing the controls a bit to make them more modern, you need to play this game before you die.-UPDATE-As others have stated this version does not come with the soundtrack, but there are ways to get it into the game. However, if you have a disc drive and open the game with a music CD in it the game will take the tracks from whatever CD you have in there. It makes for a weirdly great experience.			"

												After all these years, after the rise of Call of Duty, Battlefield, the advent of free to play, Half-Life, and the entire history of the modern FPS, Quake still more than stands up. This is a very important game in the development of the FPS genre and is often cited as the point where the term FPS was coined and the term ""Doom-clone"" was dropped. It also brought us such classic things as rocket jumping and bunny hopping.You're going to crawl through legions of Eldritch horrors which offer balanced and distinct challenges. The weapon selection is small, but well defined in its capabilities and roles.For $5, you can get currency for some terrible Free to Play or you can play one of the best FPS's ever crafted. Just do yourself a favor and seek out QuakeSpasm if you do.			"

												Welcome, my goal in this particular review is to explain you that Id Software caused the destruction of Lijiang. After the success of DOOM, Id Software had some pretty big shoes to fill. DOOM was considered a milestone in the history of gayming and many many people called it the grandfather of shooters (Because f*ck Wolfenstein). It introduced new gameplay mechanics, which were unheard of at the time and therefore revolutionary. It stimulated many gamers to become a part of the newly founded PC Master Race, which was part of the plan. Back in the days, consoles ruled the gaming world. Then, out of sudden, 3 devils appeared. John Carmack, John Romero and Tom Hall. They became very jealous demons, because of the great reception of Back to the Future and Friday the 13th, both for the NES. They saw the potential of video games and the cash, they could bring you, so they decided to create Commander Keen, which should have topped even the best of the best games. This phenomenon caused multiple horrible events. Commander Keen, a Jump 'n' Run, was a great technical achievement, because of it's smooth-scrolling graphics game engine, specifically made by John Carmack. It actually managed to show that not only platform games, but video games in general could work on the PC. Back in the days, raster graphics were pretty hard to emulate, but thanks to his genius engine, it managed to keep the transfer of graphics from the main memory to the graphic card as low as possible, because the memory of graphic cards were pretty bad. Their plan for the perfect game was nearly fulfilled. They published it on the operating system, MS-DOS. Because it was Microsoft's first operating system, it had too much of Bill Gate's power to just support the game, which was John Carmack's black magic. Thus, the simulated world of Commander Keen spawned several Vorticons for a brief moment, who rampaged through the epicenter at the town Rascht. This caused the Manjil-Rudbar earthquake. This earthquake killed almost the entire population of console gamers (Their consoles too!), so the remaining ones were forced to play Commander Keen, when it became more popular because of this disaster.This event didn't get unnoticed by Bill Gates. He felt how his power, mixed with the game engine/black magic, caused the earthquake. However, Apogee Software, which published the game, confirmed his theory. He tried to blackmail them, because he knew what they had done and he also wanted the lucre of this technological monster, which they created. They had no choice, so they made the deal.Their next choice was to create the first Ego-Shooter ever made, Wolfenstein 3D. It was their next technical achievement. Finally enabling three-dimensionality with 2D Sprites.However, their goal was not only to create money, but to secure it. Only Bill Gates, Id Software or also called ""the three demons"" and Apogee Software knew of this horrible method. Bill Gates was able to control or cooperate with the three, since they were just as evil as him, but he feared that Apogee would someday gain enough money with this pact in order to beat all of them and bring back balance to the console games with the greatest console game of all time, which was part of a ♥♥♥♥ing prophecy, as always. So, Bill Gates and the two Johns decided to sacrifice Tom Hall in order to manipulate this path of the prophecy. In 1992, after Wolfenstein 3D was released, it caused, once again, an earthquake, which killed three people in California (Which is why Apogee didn't notice it). One of them was Tom Hall. Now, his fellow partners resurrected him as a new fallen angel with no knowledge of his past life. They sent him to Apogee, so they would all get amnesia from him and forget about their work with Bill Gates and Id Software. They then became 3D Realms and created Duke Nukem 3D. Later, they created Duke Nukem: Forever, which was supposed to be the greatest console game of all time, but became corrupted (Kinda like the Anakin Skywalker of video games). The hope for the console age was already demolished at this point, but the 2D Sprites from Duke Nukem: 3D, which were dark and corrupted sources, were implemented in CoD. http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/ubpKUvd8NXM/0.jpg This 2D Sprite fire manipulated all the other developers in the world to create ♥♥♥♥♥♥ CoD clones. Only Indie Developers (because they had low power) and Valve (because Gabe Newell worked at Microsoft) were spared. Then they started to work on Doom, which should have perfected everything from Wolfenstein 3D, because they wanted to make as much money as possible, without spending too much money on creating something new. Doom was, as previously mentioned in the beginning, a sucess (Even though Wikipedia says that Tom Hall was one of the Designers, it was just an actor, who played him). Since Doom's Id tech 1 engine was just an improved version of the Wolfenstein one, it was a bit too much for the same platform/operating system they used before, MS-DOS (Now Win95). But instead of causing yet another earthquake, it just corrupted the new publishers, mainly Bethesda and ESPECIALLY Activision to spread the destruction to console games even further in the future (They basically became Bill Gate's Nazguls). The problem for Bill Gates was that the black magic, which the 2 John-Demons used for the previous 3 games, confused too much of his own power. The first real evidence for this was when he promoted Doom:

			Hate Bill Gates? Love Doom? What you are about to witness is a video that has never seen the light of day outside of the Microsoft Judgement Day event on October 30th, 1995		

I mean, he even wears a coat! Anyway, he realized that he could control the black magic, which John Carmack put into his game engines, before getting trumped by it (Microsoft was the second most installed software...second to Doom). The only problem was John Romero, who was pretty much the heart of Id Software, while Carmack was the brain...and their pawns were the muscles.  He could control the brain, and therefore it's muscles, but not the heart. So the best choice was to let them create yet another game, sadistically called Quake, for all the previous earthquakes, but most importantly, for the upcoming one. He knew that the new Quake Engine would be so extremly powerful that even months before it's release, an earthquake would emerge. He guided it's direction to Lijiang, birthplace of John Romero (I mean, he does kinda look asian: http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1534/15343359/262233) This attack weakened Romero so much that he went batshit insane and left Id Software, because of certain ""disagreements"". He later co-founded with Tom Hall Ion Storm and created one of the worst known games: Daikatana. This harmed the image of the PC-Gaming scene, but was soon balanced out by a hero called Warren Spector, who made Deus Ex, the best game ever made. Let's go back to the past. After Quake was finally released, Bill Gates still became corrupted, even though he had only John Carmack to control. The problem was that Doom was already a little bit too much for MS-DOS and the quake engine, with it's polygonal models and full 3D level design, a fortiori. Bill Gates knew the risk, when creating a new game with a new game engine from Carmack, but he didn't expect it to slip that much away from his hands and it was still better than creating a new game with Romero, which would have caused more horrible things. (Id Software and it's two leaders were too much of a threat to just say:""♥♥♥♥ it! I won't let you create another game!"", because video games ruled all over the world, which is also why TV tries to bring back it's reputation by blaming video games for mass shootings.) Bill Gates became completely the opposite of his past self, creating the Xbox and supporting not only Bungie or the Xbox, but the entire console age with Halo. So, at the end, the prophecy went true. The console age would return, it just wasn't directly Apogee, who caused it with their ""best console game ever"" Oh, by the way, Quake is great.			"

												Classic FPS set in a Lovecraft universe/mythos. This release on Steam is missing the soundtrack to the game by NIN. It's very dissapointing to not see it included however it's still a great game and people are still playing Quake multiplayer to this day. It stands the test of time very well if you run it on an updated engine developed by the fans/community (ex. proquake, darkplaces, etc).			"

												Quake, twenty years on, is still an amazing game that has endured the test of time. I played it for the first time only last year and I enjoyed it immensely. The gameplay is incredibly fast and smooth--it differs itself from Dooms methodical room-clearing by being all about movement. The only way to play this game is on the hardest difficulties, when rooms filled with obsticales are littered with dozens of enemies and you're utilizing the game's fast paced movements and gravitational physics to bounce around at high speeds, doging projectiles and spraying bullets everywhere. Quake is a punishing game that rewards constant vigilance with your movement, and it's what makes the game shine. Every level is intense on an emotional and logical level, so no encounter is ever dull or boring. It's immensely rich, gameplay-wise.Aesthetically, the vistuals are naturally dated, but I think this works in the game's favor. If Doom was that excitable 80s metal head who's presence demands attention, Quake is that mid-90s industrial loner in the corner, brooding quietly. The levels are a mishmash of industrial gothic castles and cathedrals, but the atmosphere itself is a perpetual sense of nihilism and dread. The choppy and rusty graphics just work in favor of the game's visuals.This is aided immensely by Trent Reznor's work on the sound design. The sound effects are meaty, the guns sound piercing and LOUD, as they should, and grabbing an ammo box gives such a satisfying CHH-CHH sound that I can still hear it now. It's not just the sound effects either--the music is also equally amazing. It's one of the best ambient-droning-industrial soundtracks out there for video games, and the fact that it's not somehow packaged in the Steam release is an absolute shame, since I can't imagine ever playing this game without music. If you are going to buy it on here, get a CD of the game and keep it in your harddrive, or use the music pack mods. I cannot stress that enough. Playing this game without the gloomy, screeching soundtrack takes away so much to what this game already has to offer.Playing Quake is like seeing all the rings on the inside of a tree-stump for late 90s, early 2000s PC FPS games. Absolutely play it.			"

												For a game nearly as old as myself, Quake has held up VERY well. Each level is a medieval maze filled with monsters and creatures straight out of your worst nightmares who all want to kill you. Starting with just a shotgun, you collect your weapons as you progress until you have an arsenal good enough to take on anything you could encounter. As older games do, Quake doesn't go easy on you. Even on the easy levels, I often found myself in dire need of either health, armor, or ammo. Learning what weapons work best, what traps to avoid, and where to look for secret health packs is vital to your survival in this nightmarish world.For me, the best part of this game is the movement. Fast movement and the ability to bunnyhop around enemies you just can't fight at the moment really seals the deal on this excellent game.And let's not forget that a mod of this series led to Team Fortress 2, everyone's favorite game at some point. Also rocket jumping. GOD I love rocket jumping. Also install the Ultimate Quake Patch. It adds the original soundtrack and a load of other fixes to make this game even more wonderful. "

												In a world where every FPS tries to have some gimmick to get you to buy it, you can always turn to this gem and just shoot things.The story is similar to Doom: a top secret experiment known as QUAKE goes wrong, and monsters pour forth from another dimension. You have to stop them. The monsters in Quake are well designed and have a fun eldritch feel to them. I cannot remember their names for the life of me, but my favorite is what I like to call Electro-Yeti. The action is similar to Doom, but slightly slower paced. You won't open a door and have fifty demons charging at you at once. However, everything deals more damage and combat is more visceral.It's totally worth what little money they're asking for it.

												Quake is one of the best Id titles around. It has bad ♥♥♥ weapons, enemies, sound effects and music (provided by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails). It has very interesting level design that is a lot more advanced than Doom's. Each episode starts out in a military base that has a portal to other dimensions, so there's lots of variety in each episode. The enemies range from grunts with shotguns to giants who shoot lightning, there's a lot of things in between. Weapons are amazing, with sound effects that make them all seem very powerful. The weapons in Quake are all very useful for various situations, it is important to learn each weapons functionality. Armor is a very important item in Quake. You die much quicker in Quake without armor than you do in other games from this time period, so always be well stocked up on armor. My only complaints are that only the first episode ends in a boss fight, the rest do not, though the other 3 episodes are much harder than the first, still a boss fight for each rune would've been nice. Another thing, Quake has aged quite a bit, in the 90s Quake was a pretty scary game, but at least for me, its fear factor is no longer present. A Steam version only complaint, Steam Quake doesn't loop the music tracks on its own, you must use a patched EXE and rip the CD audio to mp3 format to get it to work (there is a guide on Steam about how to do this). This should not be a problem, but it is, and it seems to be a problem that plagues not only Quake, but other CD audio based games such as Quake II, Hexen II, Blood, and more. There are no achievements, which doesn't bother me but it might bother others. I have yet to try online play with the Steam version so I have no real comment, but Quake multiplayer is amazing, I hope that it works on Steam.If you like Doom, or other FPS games of the 90s, you'll love Quake.

												TL;DR: Best power-up, Quad Damage = max fun gibbing demons. Also telefrag = pro final boss fight.Not the very first first-person shooter ever made, but close to it! If you do not own this game yet... well, were you born yesterday?! Ask a random person if they know of Quake and nine times out of ten they will. Quake's infamy knows no bounds, and for good reasons.At its core, it's a demon slaughterfest. Run around finding keys and open up more levels  so you can blow up, pump full of shells, and even gib your enemies everywhere you find them.It survives almost all versions of Windows over the years - in many cases fans themselves find their way around compatibility problems. You are given a few choices as to how to boot up your game of Quake on Steam. Just find whatever works best for you, experiment a little. The graphics are dated but playable, even more so with new resolutions available. On the plus side framerate will never be an issue here.Enemies consist of all sorts of memorable foes: human grunts (enthralled or converted or something), vors, scrags, ogres - even yetis. Thankfully there's a nice selection of weapons and power-ups to help you wade through the carnage. Shotguns and double-barrelled shotguns, grenade and rocket launchers are all solid choices, but my favourite weapon would have to be the super nailgun. Yes, there are nailguns; a nod to Trent Reznor, who did the game's soundtrack. Why do I say this? The proof is on the ammo boxes of nails, for they bear his band's logo, NIN, better known as Nine Inch Nails.Yet, for some reason or another the soundtrack is absent from the Steam version of Quake. Never fear! A quick download and patch can fix this - in the form of Ultimate Quake. Just Google it, easy fix.I've mentioned some enemies briefly. What makes them all so special, huggable, and why play this instead of, say, DOOM?The answer is fun factor. With game elements such as a yeti's projectile lightning, vor bombs (capable of turning corners!)ogre grenades and ridiculously high and long fiend jumps, there is a far easier time of getting demons to fight each other.. So forget trying to line up cacodemon cheese-and-bacon balls with a hell knight, Quake is where you crack open the popcorn.But wait, there's more. Everyone's favourite power-up is the Quad Damage. The name is kind of hard to misconstrue. It goes without saying that they never last long enough either - once I get one I run around at top speed trying to find and kill everything in the level. Even the toughest foes flinch at a 4x damage hit from most weapons. One double-barrelled shottie blast at point-blank is... epic.Other odds and ends: great enemy sound effects, they're all unique and specific to each enemy. Some damage flinches are golden too - the knight clutching his ear and stumbling always makes me grin. Good take on zombies too - kill them with anything other than explosions and they just keep getting back up again. Proof that explosions are f***ing awesome in everything you do. I'm pretty sure their attack is picking off a bit of their own brain and throwing it at you. Ew. But I guess they don't have any need for it!Still further is the replayability. Finished Nightmare without saving and thought it was too easy? Join the speedrun community! It's crazy stuff, but great for a laugh. Rocket jumps (think: get hit by your own rocket or grenade) for boosting speed and getting to places that may seem like cheating is almost a sport in its own right.Get this classic in your library and give it a gib. Rediscover the meaning of FPS fun.			"

 Played on Darkplaces Sourceport via Ultimate Quake patch  A DISCLAIMER Everything you are about to read is entirely my opinion, proceed with caution. Now, before an angry mob comes and chews me out. Just hear me out, alright?  My Thoughts I  personally  (as some may agree) think that Doom was a much more enjoyble experience than this. But that doesn't take away anything from Quake itself, the game is great, fast paced, definitely set the standards for the FPS games we have today, as well as introducing tricks such as b-hopping, rocket jumping, etc. Without Quake, there would be no Half-Life, without Half-Life, there'd be no Counter-Strike and so on, you get the picture. Quake was also id Software's first full fledged 3D game, everything is fully modeled. From the maps, to weapon models, and to enemies. Definitely a step up in a technical standpoint compared to Doom, kudos to John Romero and John Carmack. I appreciate what Quake is, and what id Software was going for. A kind of gothic sci-fi shooter that's episode based, much like the style of Wolfenstien and Doom. Only except you choose your skill level, and episodes in game by walking through portals, ""slipgates"" to be more precise. There are 8 regular maps in each episode, again like Doom. The soundtrack however...is meh to me, it's not bad. But it's nowhere near as memorable as Doom's, the only track I remember from Quake is the menu theme, all the other tracks are just ambience that only fit when listened in game. Surprisingly enough, the soundtrack was made noneother by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. (Who happened to be a huge fan of Doom might I add), but it's just kinda strange to me how none of the other tracks really just stick to me, you know? Considering NIN puts out some really good music. The Plot Wait what? You can't be serious, you're not playing id's games for the story, are you? Ok, well the plot is very minimal. You're a guy named Ranger, you kill stuff, you travel to different dimensions, and you kill stuff and collect runes at the end of each episode, where small plot is given through text,  again  like Wolfenstein and Doom. The Enemies You'll Face In my experience, the enemies also seem to both lack, but at the same time have variety to them, you have the standard former humans you encounter in the beginning of each episode (a la the zombiemen and shotgun guys in Doom), then later you fight these demonic kind of enemies. Most common enemy you'll face mid to late game is the Ogre, which use a grenade launcher in one hand, and a chainsaw in the other, fairly easy to kill, just shoot at it until it's dead.Though, the one enemy that stands out the most to me would have to be the Zombies, you think giving them the good old one-two with the super shotgun will kill them? Think again, they're a lot more resilient than you think. You'll have to launch a grenade at them, or maybe jam a rocket in their mouth to make 'em rest in pieces. Now I know what you're thinking: ""Oh, but Mr. Dude Man Guy, what about the Shambler?!"" yes, yes. Calm down, I was just going to get to him, it, whatever. Basically this thing is the absolute most putrid offspring between the Arch-Vile, Cyberdemon, and maybe a bit of the Baron of Hell, it's very tanky (like the aforementioned Cyberdemon). It has an attack that is based on line of sight, as long as you break it, you should be fine. It also has a very strong melee attack, like the Baron's. Truly a challenge to take on. Final Thoughts Quake itself is a great game, pioneer of the FPS genre, I'd recommend this to about anyone who's willing to go back to the roots of FPS gaming (ofc Wolfenstein mainly popularized it due to its success if you want to go deeper). But seriously, it's worth the money, I'd pick it up, especially during a sale.P.S. Easiest way to kill the shambler? Follow this very easy step  shoot at it until it dies  "

QUAKE shines the most with its fast, tough-as-nails gameplay. The enemies are scary and merciless, not to mention pretty powerful. BUT your character has all the tools they need to blow them away. There's no excuse for failure besides the gamer's own lack of skill and nerves. Thus QUAKE forces the player to become a stone cold Cthulu @$$-kicking motherf*r and when you finally waste the final boss, the feeling of accomplishment is something I rarely feel in other FPS games.I highly recommend the Ultimate Quake Patch available in the QUAKE Steam Guides. I also recommend playing on Hard mode, maybe throwing on a little Lustmord in the background for mood. And remember:  QUAKE IS FOREVER			"

												This is a game that's not only aged well, but arguably gotten better with age. It's stylish, it's simple, it's a hell of a lot of fun. In what other game do you get a wild juxtaposition of sci-fi themes, anachronistic medieval environments, and demonic enemies all in the same package? If you like first person shooters, chances are your favorite fps uses a distant branch of the Quake engine and those of you who play TF2 frequently might find a comforting familiarity with the controls and weapons.The game still has an active modding community to this day, and while not as prolific as Doom, I find this game more enjoyable and a visual treat especially as the ""low poly pixel aesthetic"" is becoming popular again and has a much tighter art direction.Just be sure to get a modern engine like Darkplaces or Quakespasm. The steam release doesn't include the music so you'll have to download that. I /highly/ recommend playing with the music on as it gives a unique and chilling atmosphere to the game like nothing else.If you finish up Quake and are looking for more action, there are plenty of maps and mods to download that continue the Quake experience. One I highly recommend is Arcane Dimensions if you're looking for new weapons, new enemies, and newer, bigger worlds to explore.			"

QUAKE - while this is an absolute-no-questions-asked classic FPS, I'd say only pick it up for purposes of nostalgia. If you didn't play it a decade ago, I wouldn't start now even though it has surprisingly aged well IMO compared to others of this time period. I wish the base game that I bought on Steam had more bells and whistles, though, such as higher resolutions and maybe crisper graphics. That's fine though.QUAKE was one of the few classic FPS games that helped define modern gaming. Much respect.			"

												At first glance, you'd probably say that you should only really play Quake 1 since it was the first ever truly 3D polygonal first person shooter.You couldn't be more wrong, since it takes Doom's high speed, fast paced gameplay, and adds an entire dimension of speed and flow to the mix you simply cannot find elsewhere, just replace demons with Lovecraftian, eldritch horrors and abominations.I don't really need to SAY anything, so much as point you to the ""Quake done Quick"" speedruns.

			Complete speedrun through the legendary game Quake. All runs were recorded separately. The runs were improved again and again throughout the ages since 1996, when the game was released.		

All this said, I wouldn't advise playing the base game since at low resolution you can give yourself a headache. My suggested sourceport would be darkplaces.http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1756923But if you want more graphical fidelity and want to install the source port yourself, you might wish to look at Tenebrae.

												Quake is a single-player and multiplayer FPS developed by id software and released 1996. It got quite infamous and is recognised today as classic. It was one of the first FPS to fully use polygons to create game enviroment and established multiplayer over Internet on PC.So, how Steam was handled? It's pretty straight copy-paste. Copy-paste of game folder. Not of game's CD. And that means that music is not just not working, but it's not even included to begin with! You will have to find somewhere soundtrack or music files or CD to get it back. And if mounting CD will not work for you, then I would recommend getting music files and _inmm software to fix it. And even then it looped too early. Soundtrack is quite important in this game, even though I have a bad feeling that most remember this Quake without it.Now, when you launch the game you will be given the choice between running Quake or Quakeworld. You also will have to choose between Software and OpenGL versions of each.Quake, also known as WinQuake, is actually a Windows-compilated version of Quake. There wasn't much difference. It's for both Single-player and multiplayer.QuakeWorld is stricly competive multiplayer. This client was released some time after Quake and was intented to make it more playable on low-speed Internet modems back then. Different way of handling server-client relations.Software is original Quake rendering. Pixelated, gritty and dark. Lo-fi. I recommend playing game in this mode on low resolution, like in DOS release, it captures Quake feel better than most other fans Source Port. Or OpenGl.OpenGL mode was added some time after game's release and made use of new-by-then hardware 3D accelration. And well, it's not pretty. First, it lacks some features when it comes to lighting. There is no such thing is ""brighter than grey"" and there are no special textures that are always full-bright. And then the main point of this mode if to make game look more high-resolution. By making every texture look muddy and uglier, actually. I mean, you can like such thing only if you really hate pixels.And last thing, once you start playing, write ""+mlook"" command in console, that you can open with ""`"" keyboard key. This will enable mouselook. Why it's not part of game's options I don't know, especially seeing how demos make use of mouse in such way.Plot of single-player is once again simple: There is unknown enemy that was given codename ""Quake"", who teleports it's army through slipgate. And now that your base was overrun, you have to make use of slipgate to travel to other otherwordly dimension, find out who ""Quake"" actually is through intermission text and then kick it's butt in most gimmicky way. And then watch the oh so epic bright ending in form text where you are told ""id software salutes you"".That pretty much means that you got 4 episodes to choose from beggining, you lose equpment in beggining of each one, the first level of each episode is base themed and actually has unique enemies and then you are off to medieval-like setting.And yes, when it comes to single-player, one of the best things Quake got to offer was atmosphere. Gritty. Dark. Well, ugly brown at times. you fight some kind of monsters in their low polygonal details. You get weapons like nailgun. It just has a bit of lovecraftian inspiration to it. There are even traps placed here and there. Bloody bloody traps. Soundtrack, while small, contributes a lot to it. And then there are some maps in Episode 4 which play strong on lights blinking or shadows being pitch dark, all in small rooms. Quake is at it's best in such levels. I am pretty sure that people who thought that Doom was scary back then were blown by Quake.And when you look at more gameplay side of it, well, on theory it should be like Doom but worse. It's slower. Physics are slightly worse, you stop completely upon encountering walls. There is less variety in weapons, even though they introduces grenade launcher, yet some weapons are just direct upgrades to others. Like, Super Shotgun isn't even good at close range, not as much as Super Nailgun. Just something when you run out of ammo on other weapons. There aren't as many enemies, nor as much of variety. You can say that half of Quake gameplay is shooting two rockets at the Ogre, who has grenade launcher and chainsaw. Or shooting 4 times with Super Shotgun at them. And it's too grey at times.But somehow game pulls through and becomes quite fun. Even if there are less enemies on the levels, it got quite a nice combat to it. And for a game that is supposed to be rushed, level design is great. It got verticality, it is mazey but not too complex, it just has floors on top of each other, fully embracing the fact that game is fully 3D now.You would think that first introduction to fully polygonal world would be quite underwhelming. That it will underuse it and later games will make it better. But no, Quake still has some good layouts, better than many later games. Should thank that talents at id software were still thinking in abstarct ways, didn't try to be as realistical as Build engine games like Duke Nukem 3D.It still got some weak points though. Like, Vores, spiders-like demons who shoot homing missiles. Actually, their missiles track players so good, that one corner is not enough to stop them and you can't circlestrafe around them. I don't understand what is the point, what kind of tactic developers wanted to use there. That, and game underdelivers on boss departament. There are only two ""proper"" bosses in the whole game. And when I say ""proper"", I actually just mean gimmicky ones.As for Deathmatch and duel parts, the multiplayer side, well, it's not so good. It made multiplayer over Internet more mainstream and common, yes. But the game balance, it doesn't age too well. It's only good on high-level of play, but same can be said about many games. Yes, it's not Quake-exclusive quality, don't tell me.You mostly have to dominate arena by grabbing most powerful weapons and powerups. Red Armor is better than any other armor, as it not only gives more armor points, but actually is more effective too. Rocket Launcher shoot quite fast missiles which are too quick to avoid properly. It's also most powerful weapon and most used one. Aside from lighting gun, which is good alternative too. Things die fast there.So, you just have to grab superior weapons and powerups and then go roflstomp everything else, including those who just spawned in.It gets even better once you realize that players are actively exploiting glitches in physic engine, like bunnyhopping and voodoo-like strafejumping, thigns that don't make a single sense. It become a standard nowadays, thus creating an artificial barrier between high-level and low-level players, where you have to practice much more than you should have to be as good and have some fighting chances.So yea, casuals should avoid. Normal players should avoid.You will have ot use server finders on Internet. And then chances are, there will be barely anybody playing. But then, most still play Quake for duels, so it must not be big issue.Still better than Valve's Deathmatch Classic.So yea, game's quality itself is good, but not groundbreaking. Just good game. But what made Quake so overpraised is technical side. The engine. First, it introduced console. Then it allows you to record demos, thus creating competiveness where players try their best and creating some kind of ""public"". Then when you combine it with glitchy physics, you will see how Speedrunning was created. And then multiplayer was more focused on Internet public. And even better, game allowed more modding abilities, much more than in original Doom. And then it allowed modding in multiplayer. Thus creating Team Fortress mod, for example. And Capture the Flag mode too.So, yes. Technical amazement, good single-player and finey multiplayer. This is the first Quake.			"

												First off, if you plan on buying this, be sure to install the ultimate quake mod so you can have the game be rendered at 1080p or higher, actually be able to look up and down and have the original ambience be restored.Anyways...An oldie but a goodie. Very fast paced, quick gameplay that has aged very well. For sure worth a look at if you're looking for an excuse to play an old game or just craving a new FPS in general. Not much to say, honestly, except for the fact that it still holds up and is enjoyable.			"

												I'm disappointed in this version. No music! First and foremost. Sure you can add it in with mods, but I thought bringing games to the Steam platform involved modification. It's not that hard fella's, Standardize it, that was half the reason I paid money for this again. Next there are glitchy animations, the sky never glitched in any version or source port of quake I had. My sega saturn has smoother texture animation than this port. This is basically GLquake and Winquake packaged together with the core files. No effort whatsoever. You would think with this one game being the grandfather to Valve and the entire Steam storefront operation they would pay respectful homage. No. I feel ripped off. Bad Valve, Bad Steam. No Megusta. The least you could do is make a free-to-play Quake: Source package like TF2. That would be truely respectful and fitting. Oh right, ID's basically owned and being dryhumped now though. Missed opportunity.			"

												Is this the last ""classical"" FPS?  Or the first ""modern"" shooter?  After nearly two decades I'm not even sure anymore.  All brown jokes aside, consider the following:* Graphics and lighting that have aged beautifully, unless you're an unrepentant graphics ♥♥♥♥♥.* Incredibly immersive sound design and score by Trent Reznor that beats most games today (playing SP campaign in the dark with headphones can get ridiculously unnerving)* FAST, FLUID, SKILLFUL GAMEPLAY -- YOU CAN AND WILL DIE.  BRUTALLY.And I'm not even going to talk about the mods, or multiplayer, or any of that other stuff we take for granted thanks to the breakthroughs this game made.  We all know.  It's not much more than a slight update of the DOOM formula, without ever really hitting those same heights, but I keep coming back to this game once in a while simply because - well, because they don't make them like this anymore.  There's the most grudging attempt at a story, not nearly as many enemies as you'd like, and a confusing mish-mash of design elements owing to the chaos at iD.  But it's a classic anyway, and IMO the last great iD title, because it just wants to be fun and atmospheric.  And it succeeds.Boot it up.  Blow off some steam.  Gib some grunts.  Axe a dog.			"

												This is pretty much the 3D version of Doom (Well, before Doom 3 came out) so if you liked that game, you're gonna love this one. Let me tell you why:The Pros:-It has great variety in its weapons, enemies and levels-The graphics (For its time) are great-The sound effects are awesome-The controls are smooth-The game can be REALLY challenging (Especially if you play on the Hard or Nightmare modes)-The enemies are, also, challenging (Again, if you play on the higher difficulties)-There's alot of secrets you can find in the game (Much like Doom 1 & 2 did)The Cons:-There's no music for the Steam version (Thankfully, you can get a source port called Darkplaces which adds the music back in)-The game is really short if you play on the lower difficulties (Easy & Normal)-No proper final boss fight like its successor, Quake 2, didAll in all, this is a game I recommend. If Wolfenstein & Doom popularised the FPS Shooter genre, Quake would be its continuation.I rate this game a 9/10			"

												People aren't just blindly prasing ID and everything they did just to praise them when talking about this game. This game is easily one of the best games FPS games, and even one of the best games of all time.  Sure, it's ""story"" is practically nonexistent unless you read the manual (which doesnt come with steam release), but thats common for 90's video games. What your REALLY here for is action, and that is both fresh and plentiful in this game. Enemies are tougher than they are in DOOM, ID's previous game, and can take more hits, deal more damage, and are generally more vicious than before. The design is great, combat is great. multiplayer is highly compettitive and fun, and its lasting impact is still felt to this day, as many games nowadays use a modification of the Quake engine or the engine of one of it's sequels, which is based on the Quake engine.In short, QUAKE IS AWESOME!!!(fyi for those whinning about no in game cd soundtrack or that is runs like crap on their hardware, please not trash-talk the steam version and find a souce port to go along with it, like Darkplaces, link here:  http://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/) "

												Quake is a game that is difficult to describe accurately. It is an experience that takes everything you think you know about first person shooters gets thrown out the window and replaced by a new standard.Quake is the first truly 3D first person game, no longer are the enemies and objects in the world represented by mere 2D sprites but are instead rendered in full glorious 3D letting you view them from every angle. This also opens up the maps and up, down, left and right are now all equal and most all be checked to find that one pesky monster shooting at you.The weapons are plentiful and varied from the grenade launcher which, thanks to the 3D engine, can be used to bounce grenades off walls and ceilings to hit enemies that are hiding to the iconic lightning gun and extremely entertaining nail gun. All the weapons have excellent sound effects and animations and use them efficiently leaves you feeling powerful.Using the weapons efficiently however requires more skill than ever before, aiming in the general direction of your enemies will not suffice and only a steady mouse hand will prevail against the alien hordes.Map design is of an equally high quality with a great emphasis on atmospheric lightning and a decent about of nooks and crannies to find hidden goodies in. The multi-player maps are equally well balanced and will reward only the most skilled among you.Throughout the maps, both single- and multi-player, you will encounter power-ups that grant you various short lived bonuses such as increased damage, more health, invisibility and other good stuff. Knowledge of their locations can quickly turn defeat into victory for the observant player.Graphically there is not much to say. Quake simply sets the bar and it is up to the rest of the world to follow.An excellent soundtrack sets the mood throughout the game and creates a dark and tense atmosphere that only increases as you progress through the levels.All in all Quake is perhaps the greatest first person shooter every released simply because of how many firsts it can boast. Without it nothing would be the same and for that reason alone this is a game that no self respecting gamer can go without.			"

Truly an ageless game, few things come close to its frantic gunplay, awe-inspiring levels and horrific, if low-resolution, enemies. I can't say anything that hasn't been said already, but I do advise anyone who's ever been slightly interested in FPS games to buy it and play it, after eventually patching it with the DarkPlaces engine.

												This is the epitome of classic first-person shooters. My second favorite in the first-person shooter genre, but nothing will  ever top the Half-Life series. With suffering from one problem, no music during gameplay. Maybe because of licensing issues. I'll call this one ""SilentQuake"". Some like it that way, mainly because people think it's creepier that way. Before Quake, First-person shooters especially Star Wars: Dark Forces were referred to as ""Doom clones"", despite that game being made on Lucasarts' Jedi engine.			"

Quake is a first person shooter released by id Software in 1996. One of the earliest 3D shooters, Quake became the basis for shooters beyond it for years to come, like Doom before it. Quake was also one of the most popular games to mod. Aforementioned mods also spawned franchises that are still popular today, such as Counter-Strike and Team Fortress.Quake's artstyle is one that immediately stands out, it's very Lovecraftian, with indescribably horrifying monsters and huge creepy castles.The sound design is great too. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails fame was brought in to do the music and sounds, and they're absolutely fantastic. With creepy ambient sound effects, and horrific monster voices, the whole game's atmosphere is practically made by the sound design. The biggest problem with all of this, is that the Steam version doesn't contain the soundtrack, so you need to download a patch to add them back in, or simply put the original cd in if you have it.Back to the aforementioned castles, the levels largely consist of maze-like castles and fortresses filled with secrets and monsters. Powerups, weapons, and shortcuts are all hidden behind secret doors and in the shadows. The level-design overall is par for the course when it comes to old-school id, meaning it kicks major ♥♥♥.The weapons are pretty varied, with shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers, pretty much all the tropes that these games invented, Quake has. It has a few powerups too, these being the Quad Damage, Pentagram of Protection, and the Ring of Shadows. Enemy variety is also fantastic, with some enemies that are explosive resistant, others that need to be blown to smithereens, otherwise getting back up and continuing the fight. The multiplayer isn't really active, although it's still great for lan parties.ProsSolid, if simple, gameplayGreat map designArtstyle was original for games back then, and is still somewhat original today.Sound design on the level of games like ThiefWeapon and enemy varietyConsSoundtrack is missing in Steam version, requiring a patch to add it back in.Multiplayer isn't very active. Understandable, as the newer games have expanded upon it.Final Thoughts:Quake has a fantastic artstyle and horrifyingly awesome sound design. It's officially 20 years old as of today, and it remains one of the best arena shooters of all time.Rating: 10/10This review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.

												So even to this day, there hasn't been a Quake more visually disgusting, and truly macabre. The weird psuedo-gothic horror of character themes and world designs haven't been visited since its debut, (except for Painkiller?)  really, and overall it is a must play. It was the first fully 3d fps on pc and layed the groundwork for what we have today. I will say honestly, it is still enjoyable to this date, after slight tinkering for modern desktop resolutions, is completely enjoyable. Do you even quake? If you haven't been quaking over the porcelain throne that most of all of us use, daily. this game will surely help that next bowel movement pass with ease. I first played this game when I was 6 years old, and it's just as scary as a 25 year old manchild (age of writing this review) Dat grenade launcher sound is awful, the idle npc groans and moans are truly gutteral, flatulent, and thick, like beyonce, you gotta hear it! -Donz			"

												Rocket Launcher + Quad Damage in multiplayer will let you experience what it's like to have the power of a God at your finger tips... until you're swarmed by enemy boomstickers into a crowded corner and blow everything within the blast radius of a nuclear strike - including yourself - to smithereens. Thus creating a downpour of fleshy limbs, decapitated heads and torsos amidst the mile high blood cascades, painting the entire vicinity into a hellishly beautiful scenery. In short: The most satisfying gib fest-simulator ever made.			"

												Do you like/play videogames?Do you like/play First Person Shooters?If the answer to any of those questions is ""Yes"" then PLAY THIS GAMEQUAKE FREAKING RULES: It is simultaneously the most important PC videogame to ever be released aside from Unreal and Doom, and at the same time one of the most pulse pounding, erection throbbing, masculine pieces of hardcore videogaming to be ever devised.  If you haven't played this game, you can't call yourself a lover of videogames.The story is.... Well WHO GIVES A HORSE?? But in case you want to know what's going on:You are Ranger: A warrior of earth who is sent by the leaders of earth through these ancient portals (Called Slipgates) into other dimentions to retrieve 4 runes and stop the evil overlord Shub-Niggurath that is controlling all the monsters that you fight. The whole story is told through the level design, and from the text and the end of each episode, just to make sure you haven't ran away to burn down your school.The art style is very reminisent of Gothic, Sci-fi, Hell, and the Occult. The whole art style feels like a love letter to the powerful H.P. Lovecraft (if you don't know him, get out and read Cthulu).  Playing Quake feels like being trapped in a metal band's nightmare of awesomness. It's dark, gritty, terrifying, and it just feels wrong. but plays so right. And it should feel like a metal band's nightmare, because Trent Reznor of the band Nine Inch Nails helped ID Software create this masterpiece. He did the amazing music, some of the iconic sound effects, and the voice of Ranger.The level design is SECOND TO NONE: This is as criptic as Doom, and every single map is carefully constructed and planned so that you feel overwhelmed on where you need to go, yet they are simple enough to navigate so that you get the feeling of being a baddass, overcoming the criptic levels. The sheer amount of effort and detail that went into these levels puts every single fps level made today to shame. Even Doom 2016's levels, while criptic and challenging, are childs play compared to the epicness of Quake. The only other games I can think of that have better level design that this are Doom 1 & 2, Heretic/Hexen, Blood, Duke Nukem 3D, and Unreal 1. And even then, I would say that Quake is more complex and better than all of them: the levels are not as straightforward as Dooms, nor as brainkilling as Heretic/Hexens, nor as believable or iconic as Blood or Duke Nukem 3D's; Quake's levels feel like something out of a nightmare and there has been nothing like this ever been seen since.The music in Quake is just simply amazing. It captures the whole mood of being in a nightmare, and is as iconic as Quake it'self. Just listen to this, and it sums up what playing quake is like:


YouTube™ Video: Nine Inch Nails - Quake - Main Theme 

			Views: 820,866		

			This is the main theme from the legendary PC-game Quake, released in 1996, which became a worthy follower of the id-software´s cult Doom.		

The enemies are amazing and very original too: You have to learn and memorise all their attack patterns and behaviours to overcome them, and use the right weapon for the right enemy.The weapons themselves are also metal as ♥♥♥♥: You start off with Ranger's iconic useless Axe, and a fast firing shotgun. There is then the Double barrel shotgun, and the rocket launcher, all stuff you expect. Instead of a machine gun, you have NAILGUNS: a Double barrel nailgun, and a Gattling nail gun, and the nails are not hitscan attacks they are projectiles, so you have to lead your targets. You also get a grenade launcher and a rocket launcher to kill the undead zombies, as they can only be killed by Gibbing them. Finally you have the lightning gun, which requires you to have a line of sight on your enemies to use, so you can't simply use it and duck behind a pillar, meaning you have to THINK on how you will use it.And did I mention this game is hard? FREAKING hard? Even on the easiest difficulty this game will test your skills to the bone. In fact the Nightmare difficulty is so hard that they hid it in the episode select hub. See if you can find it and takkle the ultimate challenge.This is also one of the most important PC games ever made: It was one of the first games to use 3D polygons and run itself off a computers CPU, which was mindboggling for the year 1997. It was the first FPS game to implement the WASD+Mouse controls as standard for FPS, it cemented the fast paced arena deathmatch multiplayer, and it's mindblowing idTech graphics engine created a game engine for HUNDREDS of games to use. So many iconic games today have used this game's engine; Call of Duty, Half-Life, Counter-Strike, the original Team Fortress was a mod for this, and I could go on ALL DAY.Quake is one of the greatest videogames of all time, and the aftershock of it's impact and legecy are STILL being felt to this day. Quake changed videgames forever. 5/5 An unmissable masterpiece.Still not convinced? Watch this:

												Quake, along with Doom and Doom 2, is one of the best FPS games in existence. If you liked Doom and/or have grown tired of modern military FPS games, and haven't played Quake before, then I think you really should give Quake a shot. It's a great game. (You can skip Quake 2 and not really miss much). The game is fast and fluid, it has the best grenade ""tinkle sound"" in any game, the best jump/hump sound in existence, and the guns, like Doom, are in 'the middle', so the avatar feels like some kind of supernatural tank. Unlike a lot of contemporary 'Early 3D' games that look like complete ♥♥♥ due to the low level of polygons, I think Quake still manages to pull it off it's look. (Though only if you play it in non-GL mode. Bilinear filtering on tiny textures looks terrible, and is one of the main reasons early 3D games (e.g. Sin) look so bad). I really like the light/shadow of the levels and the particle effects, though the levels are a bit on the brown side, admittedly.All of the levels are weird and abstract, and don't just look like the crate storage rooms used in Quake 2 and every game since then. The low poly, highly angular level geometry helps this as well. Some of them (e.g. episode 2?) are even weird checker-board castles and such. There's also a lot of up/down movement in those levels, with the famous concept of speed running being possible by a few well placed explosions giving the player the ability to bypass huge amounts of level if they're skilled or completely lucky. There's definitely still an 'explorable' mental-map-forming aspect to a lot of the maps, much like Doom, (though it lacks an automap) and this allows the maps to contain secrets and easter eggs, something I really miss in later games. Most of all there's no attempt at cutscenes or 'story' or anything. It's like Doom in that it's pretty much pure-play. (Actually, there might be a few camera changes in the game that kind of look a bit like cutscenes?). Quake is a very non-modal game, as everything is done in that first person view. Even the choice of difficulty and a episode is performed in-game by running through portals.I'd like to think that the reason I like Quake 1 isn't rose-tinted nostalgia, as I actually never played Quake at the time of release, but only long after I'd played Quake 2 and Half-Life. I've not played Quake as much as Doom1/2, so the initial Quake levels don't fill me with as much dread/boredom as the early Doom levels. (I've played Doom/2 practically from their time of release). Quake also isn't just a boring tech-demo, like Unreal or Quake 2 (which I also played at the contemporary time), but is fun from the first second of being in-game. If someone liked Doom and has grown tired of modern military FPS games, and hasn't played Quake before, then I think they they really should give Quake a shot. It's a great game. (You can skip Quake 2 and not really miss much). Overall: Quake is great!			"

												Quake is a first person shooter that has you traveling through four different dimensions in search of runes that will allow you to fight the main villain. That is pretty much all the story you get and it is up to you to reach the end of each level until you retrieve a ruin and must go to the next dimension. You are free to choose whichever dimension to go to first but I suggest starting from left to right since that introduces all the weapons and enemies much more smoothly. Starting off you must walk into a portal to choose which difficulty you want and to select hard you have to jump over lava which was a nice touch. Your starting weapon is a shotgun, which sounds a lot more awesome than you may think since it is pretty much as useless as the pistol from Doom, disappointingly enough. This is a very fast paced shooter where your moving speed is swifter than that of most games sprinting speed these days, which really comes in handy when there is an enemy pouncing toward you and another is shooting grenades at you. Learning an enemy and it's weaknesses is vital to surviving as you will be under attack by several different types of enemies at once and must learn to choose which one poses the biggest threat or simply how to spot an opening. Like in Doom they will also attack each other if they accidentally hit one another, and that can be very advantageous if you have enough skill to cause the enemies to fight each other to the death, as it saves you both ammo and the risk of taking them on yourself.  It is still exhilarating gameplay after all this time and is just as fun today as it was back then.Environments are still rather acceptable and the atmosphere retains a strong horror vibe to it. Character models have not aged well at all and are rather laughable unfortunately. You will not have time to gawk at them though unless you want a chainsaw to the face. Enemies are pretty versatile since most have both a ranged and close quarters attack. An example is an enemy with a chainsaw attacked to it's arm that will use it when you get too close and a grenade launcher when you are at a distance. That is just one enemy, they usually through multiple types of monsters at you and adapting on the fly is the biggest part of winning a battle. All the enemies are instantly vastly different from one another and instantly recognizable which is a important thing in these type of games. Even a slime is more than capable of killing you if you are not careful.That same level of awareness is necessary when traversing the levels. You are in their world and if something looks to good to be true it most likely is. One thing that I found strange at first is that there is no activate button and you most shoot or simply walk into to switches to activate them. I was unsure how to feel about this at first, but risking a bit of ammo to shoot something that looks out of place and suspicious to find hidden secrets did end up being much better than pressing your face against walls and mashing the activate key like in Doom. Level design is amazing in Quake and each level somehow manages to feel different than the last. The four dimensions do end up blending together in my mind though since they don't really have any real noticeable gimmicks to differentiate them from one another. There is an extra dimension to fight the bad guy but it is a tiny level and ended up being a very disappointing fight.As mentioned before your basic weapon to fend off monsters is a underwhelming shotgun and a fire axe in case you are desperate. There is also a double barreled shotgun you come across later on but it is probably one of the most disappointing shotguns I have used in recent memory. It takes about 5-6 point blank shots to take out some of the most common enemies which makes the game feel bullet spongy  but worse still it burns through ammo which you can only carry 100 of that type. A huge disappointment after the legendary double barreled shotgun from Doom 2. Other weapons fair much better and are a lot more useful. There are two versions of guns that shoot nails and are very useful against enemies though ammo does go by quickly. Your most useful weapon will be a grenade launcher which outputs a huge amount of damage and ammo is plentiful though you will obviously not want to use it when enemies are close by.As is typical from games of this era, there are health kits to replenish your health and armor pickups that will allow you to take more damage. There are other pickups like a hazmat suit that lets you walk on hazards, a quad damage pickup that allows you to completely dominate your foes , a protection pick up that makes you invulnerable for awhile and a golden ring that turns you invisible. Turning invisible sounds cool in theory but once you fire at an enemy they can see you perfectly and avoiding them may not be the wisest choice as you may be attacked by those same enemies if they hear a battle nearby. On the topic of sound one thing that must be mentioned is that the Steam version had all the music removed. I don't know why but if you do not want to mod it back in I wouldn't even bother playing this game.Quake is still a very playable game if you can get past the dated graphics. It is unlike any other shooter released today and is an extinct brand of FPS which is a real shame. If you are buying it expecting multiplayer do know the community is dead and there are no bots so it all falls to the single player. One heck of a campaign though and it should last you about 6 hours. There is no real reason to play it again other than for fun or wanting to try the hidden difficulty mode. It is a perfect game to pick up and play when you are bored since most levels are only 10 to 15 minutes long. If you are on the look out for some fast paced FPS action or simply want to see why the Quake series is held in such high regards by most, Quake 1 is highly recommended.			"

												Aside from DooM, this is really the game that started it all. The nostalgia factor is extremely heavy for those gamers who were around for the birth of the FPS, hardware accelerated 3D engines, online gaming, mods, clans, and the birth of a then underground movement known as the ""gaming community"". Quake took everything DooM did and flushed it out to really kick start the PC FPS community we know and love today. GldSource came from this engine/game (and really, in some respects, Valve). TF came from the Quake community. Do you know how many dozens of current game engines are based on original Quake code? If you started your FPS fandom with Half-Life, you were actually a generation late. DooM may be the grandaddy of the FPS, but Quake is still YOUR daddy whether you know it or not.			"

												If you're wondering if you should buy Quake, I pity you. You don't know what 'frag' means. You've only played multiplayer online, alone in front of your desk. You think rocket-jumping is a stupid idea.And you, hypothetical person, need to buy Quake. It has fragging. It has a deathmatch multiplayer mode that is fast, frantic and acrobatic. And the rocket jumping? Totally practical, along with strafe-jumping, bunny-hopping, grenade jumping, and the more technical wall-rocket-jumping. Of course you should get Quake. Get four and give Quake to your friends.The world needs more fragging, and the world includes you.It's your duty as a PC gamer to at least play a game that is only slightly less important a shooter than Doom.

												Quake: The great-grandaddy of 3D/FPS, son of Doom and Heretic, son of Wolfenstein-3D (1992) and Stellar 7 -- The beauty of Quake is that is was the first bona-fide 3D 'engine' in commercial PC games. Releasing the original Quake engine to the dev community was the move that later inspired Valve Software's Gabe Newell to release their own engine-dev environment, ""Source"", owing to the first Half-Life game being built upon a modified Quake 3D engine. (dubbed ""GoldSrc"")Quake is easily one of the most significant, if not enjoyable, shooters of all time, with hundreds of different mods (including the original Team Fortress) and is still supported by a rabid fan base. Without Quake, PC gaming would not be what it is today.			"

												This game has a few issues on steam, luckily they can all be fixed if you just take a very quick look at the forum.Everything still holds up, although there are a couple levels that are a tad dull, perhaps maybe it\'s just my personal taste, but overall the atmosphere, enemies, and levels are all very interestingly designed and you can just tell that the original development team was very excited to do all kinds of weird things with the new engine they were working with.  The levels have tons of different elements to them, constantly mixing jumping, with swimming, with playforming in some area\'s.  They really took advantage of how versatile and free your character was and makes the gameplay feel very dynamic and energetic.Great experience through and through, with 2 expansions in case you want more.  There\'s also a semi-active modding community still around, not sure if it\'s still as active as Doom\'s, but they\'ve produced some great content.			"

And it has all of that in spades.  The actual visuals are dated, but I wouldnt want them changed. They hold up their charm well even after nearly 20 years. On top of all that, the game is moddable to your heart's desire. If you like shooters and want a well dsigned one that is just plain fun to play, then - even by today's standards - look no further.

I decided to buy Quake (and its sequels) after finding the shareware version on an abandonware site while looking for DOS games to try out. For its age it is simply beautiful. No matter how long you have been playing FPSes for, I think Quake is an essential addition to your collection. It's a game that has aged very well.			"

It's lovecraftian horror theme mixed with the theme of a military base gone with the wind is 5spooky7me. It plays just like doom but it's grittier than doom. I recommend playing it through Proquake  mainly because it comes with mouselook as an option, Doom is meant to be played without mouselook but Quake is definitely meant to be experienced with mouselook. Proquake also comes with them great greaiphics m8.  Quake is a legend and don't bother with the rest of the Quake games. Quake 2 is not a continuation of Quake 1, it's dull, boring, and bad at story telling. Quke 3 arena has been replaced by Quake live which is free. Quake 4 is a continuation of Quake 2 and is the Doom 3 of Quake.			"

												Reasons why first Quake is the best current game.WARNING!:Its not my opinion,its based of facts.(Ignore down votes on this review,its from trolls)(Also my english is not that good,but i tried,so dont be a ♥♥♥♥.)1:Defined FPS genre.As made in the late 1996 by ID software,it was the definer of Doom.Full 3D poligonal graphics (first in fps),soundtrack and many more.1.1:Quake's engine is one of the most revolutionary engines in history if not THE most,and thats why you should ♥♥♥♥ing respect it.In 1999 ""Half Life"" was realeased,its was based on Quakes highly modificated engine version,Half Life defined FPS even more with its second and other parts,then all-famous Counter Strike was realeased which was mod for the first Half Life.Then CS:S,and now the Counter Strike:Global Offensive which is the most currently famous game (Accept it).Than Dota,TF2 (which respects quake with his ""Original"" weapon).And all this thanks to Quake.2:Its playable even from 20 years.You can say that FPS is not your thing,youre wrong!,it is,everyone will play fps no mather what.Quake is playable till this day,If you are saying that im wrong,than you are ignorant ♥♥♥♥ and very selfish.2.1:People who dont agree with me.Cmon man,if you dont agree with me than you are complexed and stereotype based dude.Also you are not respecting classic at all.Final Words.Kids,if Quake wasnt realeased when ur dad met your mom,you wouldnt have your favorite CSGO,your favorite DOTA 2,your favorite TF2 (im not saying that tf2s community is kids,its the best from those 3 games.).YOU DONT EVEN LIKE HALF LIFE 2 BECAUSE ITS NOT NEW.If steam was this popular in 1996,it would be the csgo replacer,Get your facts straight and respect classic kids!.That's all,you can ♥♥♥♥ off now.Proofs:http://edgecast.buscafs.com/www.levelup.com/public/uploads/images/272731_832x1501.jpghttps://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_enginehttp://www.gamespot.com/forums/system-wars-314159282/is-quake-the-most-well-designed-game-ever-made-32183270/

												This game is legendary in the FPS genre for good reason. At the time, it was a technical milestone for its superbly impressive 3D engine (which is quite dated, of course), which would later go on to power games like Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight and Half-Life. It pioneered online multiplayer. It spawned a series of FPS's responsible for defining the genre throughout the 90's and beyond, though Quake 3 is probably the most widely-known of the lot these days. Ultimately, Quake 1 is an insanely fun, action-packed FPS that I can do nothing but recommend to everyone who enjoys the FPS genre. It's both great to see the history of the genre as well as still being an absolute blast to play.			"

												By all accords I see the first person shooter genre as something of a terrible plague on mankind. It kills millions and spares no one, its a terrible way to die but this ♥♥♥♥ still piles up like Mcrib orders. Its not to say that it doesn’t have its high and lows, but rather its become somewhat of a mainstay in the modern gaming industry, and a quite unwelcome one at that. In fact the industry has a become a breeding ground for generic garbage. To be honest, garbage might be too kind of a word to describe what the genre has devolved into, But that’s a story for another day buckaroo. In the case of early FPS games I can say this much, at least it felt like I was playing a game and not a dribble of cinematic boredom as contrived and cliché as Jar Jar Abrams and his infatuated fan base. But I’m getting ahead of myself as I walk down a path of that I know I cannot return. In the meantime, let us revel in what is the genius of Quake. Quake can probably be best describe as the peculiar case of taking Lovecraft, Heavy metal, and guns galore and mixing it with its own touch of Nine Inch Nail ambiance. I'm no Nine Inch Nail fan but even I can appeciate a good mind♥♥♥♥ that is the soundtrack to this game. However, perhaps that’s what stands out most about Quake… is The Lovecraft worship. No, were not talking about the sorry excuse of a Elric Rip-off style worship imbedded into the Witcher franchise, were talking about a disturbing reimaging of the idea of twisted. A twisted that crawls up your spine and pulls it out while at last laughing in your face spitting your own blood back into your eyes. Yeah a cruel sight, but I would be damned if it didn’t hit the mark and make me ask for seconds. Quake is no different. It doesn’t apologize, it doesn’t hold your hand, and it sure as hell doesn’t slow down so you can duck behind cover and whimper like a little ♥♥♥♥ as you wait for the guillotine to chop your sorry ♥♥♥ in two. You shouldn't be ducking to save your life you should be blowing your enemies into pieces to save your life. In a time where Iron sights where but a distant idea, and quick action events were nothing more than a way of describing your sex life Quake stood the test of time as a master of its craft. It’s FPS at its best, with no compromises and no Bull$*&#. You want filler, well take that crap back to anime and give it a resounding middle finger while your at it because that doesn’t exist here. This is pure mayhem and death like never before all in its own twisted world to boot. It's not here to pour out the horrors of war or to make you feel for someone its here to blast you away like a good Bolt Thrower riff. I didn't ask for a melodrama I asked for a damn game, and Quake gave that and more. To say that this is a doom clone would be a little bit of wrong misrepresentation of what is otherwise a ground breaking game in not just the FPS genre but in 3D gaming at large. I’m not here to give a history lesson but to be frank with you, this game deserves more than just praise. Quake expanded the graph from being purely horizontal to being horizontal, vertical and misdirectional (if ever that was a word) without taking a second to stop and say “well my works done here lets hit the can…”. Yeah, enjoyed the most recent entry in the Doom series (Doom 4) then you can thank Quake (and Id software who HELPED make the recent DOOM) for making what is practically an identical experience. Let’s be honest, Doom needed a little Quake to take it out of its primordial roots. No shame in what Doom started as but a facelift didn’t hurt this Hollywood failure from getting a deserving reboot. In short, Quake is to FPS what Judas Priest is to metal. It’s the ♥♥♥♥ing embodiment of FPS at its best. I couldn’t recommend this game more. Between the twisted creatures, the atmospheric environment, and a soundtrack that even Penderecki would smile in glee and lube up for... this game was FPS heaven, before cliché after anime level cliché took over the industry and Metal Gear Solid was praised as the second coming of gamer christ we had Quake. Praise the high fathers of whatever mad studio (Id studio) had the balls to do what most couldn't, make a great FPS! Sadly, we have yet to get a proper sequel to this game, and it doesn’t look promising in the future. But hell, it doesn’t stop you from going and getting this damn game. If I have any criticism of the steam version it would be simple… “Where the hell is the soundtrack?” I mean I understand copyrights a ♥♥♥♥♥, but how hard is it really to get such a thing done, I shouldn’t feel the need to make it an addition to the game but such is life. If it isn’t already obvious get this game… Better yet, get the real version of this game and enjoy you what FPS could, and should be.This is MasterOfThePit calling…“Praise to Deus Ex and praise Kek...Out”			"

Also the game's atmosphere is very well done even for today's standards, you don't see a lovecraftian themed FPS, it's unheard of, making this game very unique in that regard.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------You should really mod this game, install the soundtrack

You run around killing ugly monsters with a double barrel shotgun whilest looking for keys so that you can save Earth from invasion by an unspeakable evil.

												Created on the heels of the runaway success of the Doom series, Quake paved the way for the first-person shooter with its fast-paced action and graphical advancements. Fully realized 3D graphics resulted in some of the most intricate and well-designed maps in the genre's history. The feeling of running around the various honeycombed shortcuts is an unmatched satisfaction in FPS movement. Each map is made eye-catching and memorable by the game's distinct artstyle which draws from a fusion of medieval and metallic. The same can be said for the game's enemy roster, which range from laser rifle-lugging shock troopers to muscle-bound bundles of teeth and claws. Unfortunately the base game doesn't take full advantage of the diversity of its enemies, with later levels sinking into the tedium of firing shotgun shell after shotgun shell into ogres and death-knights. This is rectified somewhat by the higher difficulties, which see no problem in pitting unrealistic numbers against the player. Quake is an addicting and wonderful game at any price, and it's worth owning to understand what makes this game such a solid pillar of the genre. Now let's hope they don't give this an ill-fitting modern reboot as well...If you want to improve your experience check out some of the community guides on how to implement things like different engines and the soundtrack. The base Steam release is unfortunately lacking in some areas, and the work getting in fixes can be well worth the effort.			"

												This is still after all these years the game I run to when I need to have fun.  ID still pretty much owns the genre of ""I just want to kill everything with this giant gun, flick a switch, find a key, find a new gun, and kill some more.""  I still love Doom, Wolfenstein, and the rest of the Quake series; but playing the original Quake - with Trent Reznor's awesome soundtrack pumping behind the cacophony of explosions, zombie moans and chainsaw wails - takes me right back to the summer when the demo came out (THANK YOU PC GAMER) and my father and I ran to the store that night to buy a computer fast enough to play it.

												It may be fairly short (even though I'm sure Doom 2 was a comparable length, Quake just seems to go by quicker), but isn't that much better than wishing it were over sooner? Every episode I finished had me smiling with glee, while at the same time feeling regretful that I was that much closer to finishing it. Isn't that a definitive description of a fantastic game? Make no mistake, Quake came out in 1996, and while it may not hold a candle to modern games graphics-wise, it still has aged EXTREMELY well. Once you get the graphics and keymapping set up to your liking, you'll be caught up in the dark, bloody, violent, gruesome, and AWESOME explosion that is Quake. What other game takes elements from sci-fi, fantasy, some oddball Doom-esque religion, and H.P. LOVECRAFT?If you're looking for a game with tight controls, fast gameplay, creepy atmosphere, intense firefights, and GREAT music/ambience, then you've been looking for Quake.A note about the music:Due to the way the music was integrated into the original game (playing off the game CD in the drive), the Steam version does NOT include ANY music in the game. Luckily, there's a patch someone made, named ""Ultimate Quake"", that installs all the original music at the appropriate levels and times!			"

												A very important game in gaming history. It added and extra dimension when it came to FPS's and it was a landmark achievement at the time. Today, however, the third dimension is used in pretty much every game now, but Quake still holds up as a whole. It plays like a silky-smooth old-school FPS with deep/nonlinear level exploration, fast-paced projectile dodging, and a variety of differentweapons and powerups used to kill a variety of  monsters. If you like old-school FPS games, you'll love this.There is one major flaw however, one massive issue that brings the whole game down, and it's not Quake's fault, it's Steam's. There is none of the original music. When Quake was orignally released, there were two discs: one with the game, and one with the music. When they released it onto Steam, they didn't bother putting the music in with it. Why? It takes so much away from the game's atmosphere. Oh well, the gameplay is still fantastic and that's all that matters really.As great game if you want some creepy, old-school action. Just make sure you have your own music playlist ready before playing though.			"

Yes i know you may say: -But, Duke nukem 3d...  and to that i say: -no, i am sorry, it's not even close. This game is atmospheric, to the degree that it would make Lovecraft proud. The soundtrack is creepy, and if fully immerse into this world, it's so unworldly it becomes scary, i am genuinely terrified and scared when i play the game, not that it has jumpscares, it barely does, there's something sinister about everything surrounding you. Help...And yes i see, the state steam sells this game is terrible, but please Download Quke ultimate patch, it resolves all the issues, at least it worked perfectly for me. you should find it in web or steam guides. Yes it even fixes soundtrack. 9/10 one of best shooters, much, MUCH better than duke nukem 3d and/or Quake 2.			"

												There's not much I can say about Quake you haven't heard elsewhere. It's fun, it's dark, it's immersive, and it firmly established many of the conventions of FPS gaming we now take for granted. There would be no Team Fortress 2 without Quake, and that is why I wield the Original with pride. Id Software may have moved on to bigger things with Rage, but plans for Doom 4 make me believe that a new Quake may lurk somewhere beyond the horizon. It's important to know your roots in gaming, and while I got my online start in Starsiege: Tribes, my favorite singleplayer FPS of yore was probably Quake, if not Half-Life. Quake gave me my love of shotguns and grenade launchers and if an FPS cannot deliver me satisfying examples of such, then it does not measure up to my expectations for what constitutes adequate firepower. You can keep your assault rifles, throwing knives and tactical nukes. Give me a little buckshot and a little boom, and I will give you delicious interdimensional demon gibs.			"

												A good shooter from the 90s, with graphics that are a little (ok, VERY) dated now, but with good sound design in terms of overall presentation. Actually, speaking of presentation, this game has a large quantity of brown and grey, and does seem a little ugly. But it's a part of the style, so I won't complain. The gameplay (being the most important) is what you'd expect from a shooter, but the locales and enemies keep it interesting. The difficulty is varried, but fair given that you can use quicksaves/quickloads. Again, no complaints on this front, What I will complain about is the story, it's a hodge-podge of vague text boxes jammed in your face before and after every level that I don't even remember half of. But the game doesn't really suffer for it, the gameplay is what we're all here for, and like I said, it's fun and functional to play, and I definitely recomend it... unless you're bothered by dated grapics.8.5/10			"

												Going into this game for the first time ever was a rather an odd experience for myself. Pay in mind I played this with a source port called Dark Places.Quake was a leading FPS for many things, in a way repeating what DOOM had already established but with the 3rd Dimension. Although I personally disagree because Quake is a good game don't get me wrong, but it's Single Player I felt was rather lacking in small little spots that sort of bugged me more than it seems for everyone else.Generally speaking what bugged me the most was a lack of challenge with actual boss fights, not just jumping around pressing buttons and having some bomb just go inside the final boss then jump through a portal then just calling it a day.Maybe I was more spoiled of content like DOOM, Duke Nukem 3D, Blood, and etc. But seeing as many people praising Quake I think they were praising it for other reasons or even just technical prowess.Regardless at the end of the day I did enjoy Quakes Single Player Experience, the music was off the charts awesome (once I got it working like it should be), the Levels do give off a mix of DOOM and Hexen/Heretic, and the core gameplay is still fun. Although I personally recommend to try it on harder difficulties to give an additional challenge because some of the weapons in the more Normal Difficulty can make it a little too easy.Rating: 4/5			"

												released by id Software on June 22, 1996, Quake was programmed by John Carmack, Michael Abrash and John Cash. The level and scenarios were designed by American McGee, Sandy Petersen, John Romero and Tim Willits. The graphics were designed by Adrian Carmack, Kevin Cloud. Music and sound design was by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails fame.The game engine developed for Quake, the Quake engine, popularized several major advances in the 3D game genre: polygonal models instead of prerendered sprites; full 3D level design instead of a 2.5D map; prerendered lightmaps; and allowing end users to partially program the game (in this case with QuakeC), which popularized fan-created modifications (mods).

												Quake.If you’re here, the odds that you know what Quake is are pretty significant, so this review might seem a little (or quite a bit) pointless.But, Quake has a special meaning to me – Quake and I go way back, it being one of the first games I would ever play, along with Half-life and Doom. I still remember those days, zipping around those moody corridors and those dank, decrepit hallways, filling everything that moved with as many rounds as my 6-year-old hands were able to pump out... Before inevitably dying at the hands of some monstrosity, of course.Sure, I wasn’t good at it by any conceivable degree, but damn, I still loved it. It was more than just a game to me, the environment, the enemy design – it all came together to create an experience that I just can’t seem to dig out of my head, not that I would ever want to. Even now, I still feel that urge to boot it up and shoot something.I can’t promise that your time with Quake will be anything similar to mine, and you may find it to be dated, uninteresting or dull (and, in my opinion NONE of those things can define Quake). But to me, Quake will always be there, flashing through the back of my mind, making me feel the same way about it as I did 12 years ago, and because of that, I have no choice but to recommend it. "

												  I do still remember the very first time I played Quake; I liked it from the beginning: the visuals, colours, sound effects, and then, the music. I never knew the music and sound effectes were composed by Trent Reznor until I actually got the game and began playing and noticed that ammo box with the NIN logo.  Quake still absolutely stands up today. Its visuals might be pixellated, the environments often rather monochrome, as became the running gag, yet the design of the world is admirable, the levels balanced, structured and well paced. The variety on display, despite the vast swathes of brown, dwarfs that of most modern games as well. This game itself wrote into its story a great way of swinging between science fiction and grim medieval fantasy: set the game in the future, and have it be about a dude travelling through flashy, high-tech slipgate complexes into an alternate dimension where everything’s grand but grimy, and apparently six centuries old.  The weapons pack a punch, though, which is a good thing. While Quake’s 3D engine meant it could never pack quite as many enemies on-screen as its spiritual predecessor, Doom, those who are present are a tough collective. The Vores, for example (arachnoid beasts firing heat-seeking spike balls from their bellies) take an absolute age to bring down, not to mention a rucksack full of rockets. And the sheer breathtaking speed of the Fiends, all claws and jaws and nightmare, means that hitting them before they scratch your eyes out is a genuinely finger-destroying task.  Those are just a few of the reasons why I do still like Quake a lot today, after 20 years.			"

												Amazing id gameplay that still stands up to this day. Feels responsive and ageless.  The later levels become super tedious and boring; which are mostly Sandy's levels. A must play, and with a source port 1080p at  1500+ frames it's a good experience that lives up to the expectations and standards of today.			"

												A true classic FPS. It's a must play for anywone who has played a game with a first person camera. Sure, the graphics are ugly and envirements suffer from ""BROWN SYNDROME"". If you look past that though you find amazing enemy designs and places. There is nothing like shooting lovercraftian monsters in a gothic castle. The combat is fast-paced like DOOM. No wimpy cover systems here! Each enemy is dynamic and intresting. Giant monsters with only a mouth and brutal claws that shoot lighting, to leaping monsters who jump at your face. Sadly, the weapons are weak. That does make each enemy intimidating though. 10/10 MUST PLAY "

												If you like FPS games  you owe it to yourself to play Quake.  Quake pulled off a few firsts in FPS games.First truly 3d.First Team Fortress Mod.First true professional gaming scene.First true Capture The Flag.The list goes on and on.  The game is still played professionally, has live servers, dedicated fans, and has been updated constantly with new content and improved visuals by the player and fan base.  And after all these year still remains the fastest and most demanding death match game ever produced.  It's younger sibling Quake 3 coming in a close second.			"

												To this day, Quake is still the best multiplayer first person shooter experience I've ever encountered, and it's from a time where developers and publishers gave you value for your money. It's also the grandfather of all the FPS games of today and possible more. I dare say it, it's one of the best games ever made if not the best, looking at the past, it was so revolutionary, both technology and gameplay wise, it might aswell be.			"

												Thanks, valve germany for letting me write this.Quake is id software's other FPS giant that co-created the online-FPS with all its beloved tropes. Quake offers four episodes of fast-paced, exploration based, pre-2000s FPS-glory. Despite its grim, colourless visuals, Quake plays in a much more engaging way than modern products of the genre, with its medieval/lovecraftian inspired style and ambience coupled with fast-paced movement and gunplay, it can be easily classified as a 3D Doom.However, like Doom, Quake was originally meant to be run on MS-DOS, so you might require a source port for a more convenient (or let alone executable) experience. My biggest recommendation would be the darkplaces engine, you can download it for Quake 1 as well as its expansions in this link http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1756923Quake remains one of the most popular retro-FPS games for good reasons, it still holds up as a fun and challenging arena shooter for both singleplayer and multiplayer.It's basically Deathmatch Classic if it had a singleplayer and a right to exist.And yes you ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, this is where Kindergarten Fortress 2 came from.

												I hard to figure out what should I say now... This is old game, original debuted in 22nd June, 1996.  I guess those players have bought this game who have played this game before, and now they are enjoying nostalgia. For the same reason I bought this game.  About the game: The gameplay is really simple; collect guns and ammos, shoot at anything, find the exit.  But, why did I recommend this game? Because of the atmosphere! This game has an atmosphere what I have not seen in others game yet. The sounds, the design and the silent mysterious. I think those things gives that great atmosphere to the Quake universe.  I advice if you are thinking to buy this game, see a few gameplay video of Quake. Good things: -Mystery atmosphere. -Simple gameplay. -It has online and local Co-op mod.  Bad thing: -Only a few hours gameplay. (in single-player mod) -The game does not include original musics. (you can solve this, read below)  Solve music issue: If you need the original music and little bit better graphic quality, then you must download and install [Ultimate Quake Patch].  


Ultimate Quake Patch 
A Guide for Quake
By: MOOK

			This patch utilizes the DarkPlaces engine developed by LordHavoc, the plasmagun fix by OoPpEe, the music patch originally hosted on widescreengamingforum.com and the NSIS install system developed by Nullsoft.		


Only one thing bad! After you installed this patch you must disable the Steam-overlay on this game, otherwise the game will be frozen.  I recommend this game those who want a lazy gameplay for a few hours and those who want a little bit nostalgia.  P.S. I apologies of the Quake fans for my review have not been absolute positive. I wanted to be objective.			"

												I've been playing Quake 3 for a veeery long time, but when I found the Quake Collection, I got all the Quake games (except for Quake 4) and some expansions.Quake is a fun singleplayer game, similar to the classic Doom game, and has some really fun weapons to kill with. I'm planning to finish this game, then Quake 2 and then the expansions. Multiplayer does exist, but it's made by modders and it doesn't seem to be very popular. It's easy to forget about the storyline since the monster-killing and the fast pace is too distracting, but that doesn't make the game bad.Quake is picture-perfect, however the saving process can be a pain in the ♥♥♥. You progress far into a level, then you die and you realize you forgot to save at a previous area, since there is no autosave. And then you have to play the level all over again. That's something you learn once you die, and it can be hard for someone like me to remember to save often. Of course, Quake can be modded, so you could make an autosave possible somehow...When you start playing the game, you notice you can only look to the left and right like in Doom. It can be fixed if you want by typing '+mlook' into the console ingame, and it will work like any other FPS game.All in all, I personally think this game is awesome and I'd recommend it to those who want to enjoy some good ol' classic, fast-paced games.

												The king... no, the GOD of first person shooters! This is the genre-defining, timeless masterpiece of a game that was released back in 1996. The first true 3D engine, amazing music track, horrifying monster sounds, unrivaled smooth gameplay, complex level designs, do I need to say more? You choose a difficulty and get right into the action! A must play for everyone.Oh and kids, THIS is what a FPS is. Don't get fooled by the unfortunate mistakes that are called ""games"" nowadays.P.S. There are some mods that drastically improve the graphics, and since the game is very old, some users might want to take advantage of those, even if only to play on HD resolutions. But I am sure anyone can enjoy this classic even in its purest form.			"

												Doom's Big Brother.This is the heavy hitter of id Software's library. Quake is an evolution not just for FPS games, but games as a medium.In Quake, you fight through 4 episodes of Adrenaline pumping action, much like Doom, albeit with a much much MUCH darker atmosphere. The game is quite a lot faster than Doom, with Speedrunning being quite popular with the game. Gameplay remains unchanged from Doom. You move through the levels, killing everything in your path, then leaving via exit. The game doesn't have many bosses, only really 2 (End of Episode 1 and the Final Boss), but the encounters are memorable. The enemies are all interesting, and frightening, with such enemies as the giant Shambler, Ogres that hurl grenades at you, and Fiends that claw you into bits.The maps are inspired by several dark fantasy influences, notably that of H. P. Lovecraft; most notably, the end boss of the first episode is named Chthon, and the final boss is named Shub-N iggurath, although there is little resemblance to the original literary descriptions. Some levels have Lovecraftian names as well, such as the Vaults of Zin or the Ebon Fortress. The original Quake runs on DOSBox, but you have the option to run GLQuake. Regardless of which version you want to play, make sure you look for source-ports, such as Quake Epsilon, or FTEQW to name a few to play the game at its max potential. The games soundtrack ran off of red book cd, so look for the Ultimate Quake patch as well if you want the great soundtrack as well (100% must install.) Also look for multiplayer source ports as well because the Quake community, like the Doom community, is still alive and kicking.Quake is as great as Doom is, with darker tones, and faster gameplay. If you enjoyed Doom, or just wanna play an arcadey fps, Quake is the game for you.			"

												With the addition of the new episode released by Machine Games called DOPA (I believe people refer to it as Dimensions of Past? What's the A stand for?) I felt like I needed to rework this review.This is the tightest, bloodiest, most fluid 3D action game you could ever play. From this and Quake II is where the FPS genre all sprouted.Quake is a dark, medieval, Lovecraftian themed FPS based on what was going to be a Dungeons and Dragons game. You start of in a strange Hub world where you can select difficulty, the Hard difficulty decoured with a broken bridge surrounded by lava, and walls with dead bodies stapled to it, indicating that it's not for your average player.Next thing you know, you're in a large room with four Slipgates leading to four separate dimensions, all different, but all overrun by bloody horrors.It's up to you, the player, to clear all four dimensions of these bloody thirsty monsters, and the overlords of each dimension.Gameplay: This game is where terms like 'Rocket Jump' and 'Bhopping' orginated from. This is the grand-daddy of those. The aiming is so incredibly responsive, the guns all feel so satisfying to shoot, even the basic shotgun. The level design is impossible and sensical at the same time, which gives a huge impression that you are just traversing a Cthulu version of M.C. Escher's Crazy Stairs, and it's so good. Enemies can be tricky and all have their own attack mechanics which requires thought. There's PUZZLES for god's sake.This is a game for ""the"" FPS entusiast -- there's no reason anyone would not like this game. It's action packed from the first rotweiler running at you from across a bridge to the death of Shub'Niggurath.If you have any correlation with the aged graphics engine, there's tons of addons and sourceports you can run from, that will still allow you to play within Steam. I play on Darkplaces with the ""normal"" graphics settings, which gives you close-to-original graphics without all the blurriness.Overall:It's Quake, why wouldn't you buy it?			"

												Odds are you already know if you like Quake. It is by far the defining title of the FPS genre (after Doom and Wolfenstein 3D). The Steam version comes with WinQuake, GLQuake (which never worked for me), and QuakeWorld (which didn't work for me either). Mods and a still thriving multiplayer base makes this game worth buying even today.			"

												Quake is a FPS game made by id software and released in 1996. it stood put among the FPS or ""Doom Clones"" at the time for a few notable reasons. It was fully 3D, had smooth animations at complex (for its time) level design. But how does it hold up? How does it play for a first time player? The awnser to both is amazingly well.Game:The game is set across 4 different dimensions. This causes each of the four episodes to have its own unique location. The weapons are plentifull and fun to use. The line-up includes grenade launchers, nail guns and a lightning gun. The only problem I had with the game was the two bossfights. They didn't require shooting, but pressing buttons. You may have to shoot you way to the buttons, but the bosses themselves doesn't require one bullet to kill, which really sucks. The games difficulty is on the heavy side. I played on normal and found the difficulty what I would expect on hard with other games. Respect to the people finding nightmare enjoyable and finishable..Technical:The game works out of the box with the steam version, but there are a few issues. The controls are not as smooth as modern FPS games. The soundtrack ran off a cd, that means no soundtrack for the steam version. the resolution is really low (Doesn't bother me but can bother you). To fix all three issues mentiones above (The only technical complaints I had) I used the Ultimate quake patch. It uses the DarkPlaces engine developed by LordHavoc, the plasmagun fix by OoPpEe, the music patch originally hosted on widescreengamingforum.com and the NSIS install system by Nullsoft. The Ultimate Quake Patch was compiled by (as I understand it) MenaceInc.I would highly recommend this game to ANYONE!!P.S. Don't forget to download episode 5. Its calles DOPA and was developed by Machine Games (Who did a amazing job with Wolfenstein the New Order and Wolfenstein the Old Blood) for quakes 20th birthday. It has te same old school design and if it was included with the original game, I wouldnt have know that it wasn't id that made this episode.I can't think of higher praise for DOPA. Get it if you get Quake. It was released for free. To install it you just have to create a dopa folder where quake is instelled, extract the zipfile in the folder and double click the batch file.

Doom is still brought up to this day in congressional hearings about video game violence because it was the first stand-out mainstream game to be so realistically violent and evil with upside down crosses and pentagrams. Quake was sweet like that too.

												Awesomeness in 5 letters :)Here is a more updated review, as requested by Butane:Note: I had to cut my review, most notably at the end, because apparently Steam only allows so many text. That is the reason there is no modding and sourceports 'chapter' are limited. Sorry for that.Quake is a first person shooter or FPS developed by id software, released in 1996.Originally planned to be released way earlier (it was mentioned in Commander Keen as a follow up) aimed to be a Magic&Melee type of game. The name for the game came from the protagonists name, Quake.Quake was presented as ""The most dangerous person on the continent, wielding a hammer of Thunderbolts, a Ring of Regeneration and a trans dimensional Artifact, fighting for justice""This idea was later scrapped for a more 'id software' approach, which is of course, an FPS.Quake's development was rough. Because of the 3D technology they were going for, it took John Carmack a full year to make the engine. What didn't help either was the release of games like Duke Nukem 3D, which used the Build engine, a very advanced 2.5D engine for its time. Carmack wasn't impressed by it though.When the engine was finally finished, the guys at id could finally work on the game. Sadly, the tensions were high and lots of work was wasted. So was originally a Dragon planned and a lot of other stuff. John Romero was absent a lot as well. This resulted in John Romero being fired from id after the game was released.In short, the game was rushed.In Quake, you play as a character named Ranger. Quake is the codename for an unknown enemy using slipgates (fancy word for teleporters) to send all sorts of monsters to earth. As a part of a special forces team, you have to use the slipgates to travel to Quake and kill him! Only problem here being, your team is killed off quickly and you are the only one left to fight. You have to collect 4 runes, 1 in each episode, to open a slipgate to the final boss. Thats the story in a nutshell.The gameplay is similar to previous id titles. Kill bad guys, find secrets and keys, collect supplies and exit the level. Simple stuff. After 7 levels, you have the final level where you can collect a rune, resulting in a bossfight and the exit to the level opens once you've defeated the boss. Each episode has a secret level as well. But while in Doom you could have 10 or more enemies on screen, with the new 3D engine every monsters is fully 3D. This had a large impact on performance. So in Quake you have a maximal of 5, maybe 10 enemies on screen. To compensate for this, most weapons are a lot weaker. (Than say, Dooms weapons)Speaking about weapons, you have 7 to choose from:The Axe, Shotgun, Double Barreled Shotgun, Nailgun, Supernailgun, Grenade Launcher, Rocket Launcher and Thunderbolt.- The axe is your basic melee weapon. Does little damage against enemies but has unlimited 'ammo'.- The shotgun is your basic hitscan ranged weapon. It fires 6 pellets, doing 4 damage each. It can kill a basic grunt in 2 shots and a dog 1 one shot. Uses shells.You spawn with the shotgun, axe, 100 hp and 25 shells when you start a new game and in multiplayer.- The super or double barreled shotgun is a better shotgun. Uses 2 shells and does more damage, but only effective on close range (whilst in basic shotgun has pretty good range)- The nailgun is a projectile based weapon, firing nails (duh) rapidly. It can be seen as your basic machine gun. Uses nails.- The supernailgun is the nailguns bigger brother. It has a higher firerate, does more damage and uses 2 nails for 1 shot.- The grenade launcher need no explanation. Oddly enough, it uses rockets for ammo.- The rocket launcher is pretty self explanatory, just like the grenade launcher. Uses rockets.- The Thunderbolt is the games most powerful weapon. Being a gun that shoots out lightning, it uses cells as ammo and can even kill the biggest foes in a matter of seconds. As a counter to this power, cells are pretty rare and pickups yield only few cells. Warning: don't fire this thing underwater, its totally.. Lets say, ridiculous.To spice up the gameplay, you have so called powerups. These are items that last a short time and give you a benefit.Powerups are:Quad damage. 4 times the damage for 30 seconds for every weapon. Gibbing time!Ring of shadows: invisible for 30 seconds. Sneak past monsters and players alike!Biosuit: with this, you can swim in slime without harm and it provides oxygen underwater as well. Lasts 30 seconds.Pentagram of protection. Invulnerable to any incoming damage for 30 seconds.Other powerups include armor, ammo and keycards.But what are these weapons and powerups worth when you have no bad guys to shoot? Luckily, there are plenty. I'll go over them really quickly, I promise :)Rottfish. Piranha on steroids.Rottweiler. Annoying dog.Grunt. Basic soldier.Enforcer. Basic soldier Mk. 2Zombie. You can't kill the undead, but you sure can blow it into giblets!Ogre. Uses a chainsaw Evil Dead style and wield a grenade launcher.Scrag. Floating enemy that shoots projectiles.Spawn. Slimey, jumping thing that explodes when it is killed. Episode 4 exclusive.Knight. Uses a sword.Death knight. Knights bigger brother. Comes with a projectile based attack as well.Fiend. Leaps toward you to use his sickles upclose.Vore. Mutated spider that launches homing rockets.Shambler. Big ♥♥♥ guy that has a lighting and melee attack.There are two bosses as well, which I'm not going to spoil :)Quake offers 4 episodes from the get go. Each episode has 8 levels, making for a total of 32 levels. (Final boss level and introduction level not counted)When you start a new game, you start off in the introduction level. It offers 3 slipgates, offering 3 difficulty levels. Easy, Normal and Hard. There is a 4th difficulty, Nightmare, but it is hidden in the episode selection.Selecting a difficulty leads you to the episode selection. From there you can select 1 of 4 slipgates to play that episode. After a episode is completed, that particular slipgate is locked off, meaning you completed it, since you collected the Rune.The first levels of each episode are the easiest levels. You start off in a military base with low level enemies like Rottweilers, Grunts and Enforcers. These levels are often my personal favorites, since you can see they put the most effort in them. (And I just enjoy fighting the soldiers.)After you completed all episodes, and thus collected all the runes, the gate to the final boss opens.One thing Quake is really well known for are the sounds and the soundtracks. When Doom came out, the band Nine Inch Nails got addicted to playing Doom. When they heard of Quake, Trent Reznor wanted to do work for id.He did created a lot of sounds and the legendary soundtrack. His sounds range from the voices of the grunts to the pickup sound for armor.Quake's soundtrack is really unique. It offers a more ambient horror theme than the usual id metal. With Quake being a dark and gritty game, this really sets the mood.Its hard to describe this on paper, but I suggest you go and play Quake or listen to its soundtrack at night. Back in the day, this really made people ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ their pants whilst playing.Note: Quakes soundtrack does not come with the Steam version, since it ran off an CD. Don't fear though, there are tons of patches for the soundtrack. A quick Google search will do the job. SourceportsTo run Quake on a more modern system a sourceport is recommended. I use DirectQ personally.Quake didn't became big for its singleplayer. It was the multiplayer that really gave Quake its legacy. I'm not going to go really deep into the multiplayer, since I mostly played singleplayer. Sorry :/TL:DR:Quake, a great game for its time and even nowadays. Rushed, but still very impressive. A classic id software title thats really worth picking up!			"

												10/10this game is so well designed I was really surprised, because I played it in 2014 for the first time and didnt expected this level of quality. Everything in this game makes sense and fits very well, there isnt much you could take out without killing the experience. Every weapon has its place and situation where its good at (except the weak nailgun, but since you loose all your weapons every new episode you still use it).I especially like how the guns feel. The shotgun for example has this deep sound with a quiet click sound after it and when you hit enemys with it they make a sound and cancel their attack. This makes the gun feel like you really shoot something and hurt the enemys. I cant really describe it.The levels look similar but thats because of the age of the game, they still look interesting and dont get boring.The soundtrack is extremely well and isnt some random metal music like in Quake 2 but only atmosspheric music which really fits the game and sometimes even creeped the ♥♥♥♥ out of me.ATTENTION: The game doesnt come with the soundtrack, install the Ultimate Quake Patch which not only fixes the music but also improves graphics and animation quality.

												amazing and timeless game, but I recommend playing it on a sourceport (see: community hub guides, they'll explain everything for you) instead of the winquake or quakegl executables that come with the game. Also, Machinegames released an additional fifth chapter you should check out after playing through the original game. Multiplayer servers are still active, although I'd recommend nQuake/ezQuake for the best possible experience there. Lastly, if you go to the quaddicted website you can find some really amazing custom campaigns that modders still release up to this day. I've spent about 10x as many hours on this game as my steam hours show because playing some of the sourceports won't log your hours on steam, and after all that time spent I can honestly say this game is tons of fun even today			"

												- Note that I've played at least 10 hours via a launcher that doesn't add to Steam playtime -I never played the original Quake until I got it this year so I don't have the whole nostalgia thing but even so this is it, when action games had effort put into actually making them fun and engaging with actual areas to explore and decisions to make before becoming more about hand-holding and empty spectacle.There's some weird stuff like the Super Shotgun and Nailgun just being flat upgrades of the non-supers and hit detection with some enemy attacks being a bit off, but...that's kind of it. Sure it's simple but everything works so well. This is a damn good shooter far better than most despite being two decades old now. The age sort of works to its advantage in a way, it can run on just about anything, there's a good number of levels in the main game and a history of loads of mods and maps, with people making more even today. Machine Games who did the awesome Wolfenstein reboot actually made a free level pack recently which is pretty kickass.Every fan of action games, especially those who've mostly only played recent ones should play this.

												And... lightning does in fact strike the same place twice.If you like, you could just read my DOOM review, swapping the word QUAKE for DOOM. But that wouldn't be fair.iD managed to produce another industry changer, a scant three years after DOOM was released. Whereas DOOM brought 3D gaming to the masses and made multiplayer something that people felt should be included as standard, QUAKE raised the bar even higher.PC Gamer certainly helped QUAKE along, thanks to including the shareware episode on their coverdisc. So those people not lucky enough to have fast internet access could still join in the fun.I think at the time, QUAKE was even more of a global sensation than DOOM was, but with hindsight I think it's fair to say that DOOM shook things up more than QUAKE did. But only just. A lot of QUAKE's legacy is thanks to the addons and patches which quickly followed the main game.QUAKE proved that smooth, fluid, entirely polygon-based games were feasible and practical. Suddenly, all the sprite-based FPS games that were being released looked incredibly dated. Not their fault - nobody but iD saw it coming. Duke Nukem 3D had been released just one month before iD pushed their tech demo out into the world, and everybody knew something big was coming.If DOOM made multiplayer gaming on company LANs the next big thing, then QUAKE made internet deathmatches the in-thing. Quakeworld which followed later on in the year greatly improved and streamlined this service so even those with dial-up connections could participate.GLQuake greatly improved the graphics for those lucky few who had these new-fangled 3D accelerator cards - suddenly everybody was buying Matrox and Voodoo cards just to play the new, improved QUAKE.And if people thought DOOM was expandable, QUAKE blew their minds. Not only could you make levels, you could make new models, new sound and music, and even rewrite parts of the code to make entirely new games (QUAKE Chess anybody?)Personally, QUAKE is not my favourite FPS. Not by a long shot. I don't think I ever even finished the single-player campaign. But I can't deny it's influence, and it is amazing to see what they did with the hardware at the time.			"

												Trent Reznor.....not that it matters mind you. There is no music included with the Steam Version.Amazing, fast paced, run-and-gun FPS gameplay from the mid-90s. An ID software classic with awe inspiring gothic theme. Quake is all about an invasion of Earth by Shub-Niggurath (a cthulhu like being which resembles a Dark Young) via a series of slipgates created by humanity in an attempt to create teleportation technology. A lot like DOOM when you get right down to it. This is Gothic though, DOOM was more or less......well hellspawn. Without this game there would be no Half Life or Call of Duty. Period.			"

												     This game is the base of every modern FPS. This game was revolutionary for many reasons. One of these is the amazing Team Fortress mod (which I still play to this day), also its engine was the same base engine of all gold source games (Day of Defeat, Half-Life, TFC, and more), plus this game was one of the first FPS, and one of the first to have online multiplayer. I might not of played Quake ""back in the day"" but I can tell that it is still a amazing FPS and more people need to rejoin its amazing online multiplayer. I highly support this game and belive it is a gold mine of gaming history.-John			"

												I'm really not sure why this is on Steam when the Nine Inch Nails Soundtrack has been removed. It's understandable that the developers can't completely get the rights to the tracks, but if the music is going to be absent it may as well not be in the library at all. I've heard some people like it without it anyway as it adds to the atmosphere, but taking a feature out of a game just ruins the experience for me.

												The game, the legend. Even the vanilla version is so well crafted that it doesn't feel old or dated. It feels like a fresh retro style game with solid gameplay and amazing atmosphere. Add to it the support of more advanced engines and mods and you have an evergreen that will always be alive. I'm Running this on quakespasm engine and arcane dimensions mod and having a time of my life.			"

												Most of the games today, have good graphics and a sh.it or don't even have something you can call a gameplay..well, back in the day of 1996 where Quake was firstly released, games had in the monocle of today a ""not so good"" graphical engine, but they had a gameplay where you needed ""skill""..I mean..              look at the timeline of the DOOM games:Take the first doom and compare it to the 4th from today..DOOM (1993):A very tricky to hardcored gameplay with a lack of ammunition and strategic well made maps with very good kept secret rooms and a frantic atmosphere.and of course:     YOU NEEDED A HELL LOT OF SKILLDOOM (2016):A game with a bit of the frantic atmosphere from of the original game, but with less lack of ammunition..    I mean..WTF ID-Soft?!    Back in the day, you had to kill as much demons with as less shots you could, to save ammunition because ammo packages were excitingly rare, compared to todays DOOM where you just have to chainsaw one lil' less demon to get a full ammo supply laying all over the place to keep on tearing yourself thru this game with the non-skill this game actually uses..WHAT THE ACTUAL &%!?#/I could have been sitting a five year old re.tar.ded kid with a parkinson syndrom in front of that screen to complete that game in less than 5 seconds..      ARE YOU SERIOUS?!Anyway..    this was just an example of how games changed over the years..BACK TO QUAKE!Well it was, it is and it will be still one of my favourite games of all time, whether somebody complains about the graphics or not!Thumbs up, nice game!

												As much as the game is fun, it's not worth the headaches it gives you.  Just to run at 1080p, you have to install some confusing mods. The game says that you can modify the resolution through the command prompt, but that crashes your game. On top of all this, this version of the game doesn't even have the soundtrack. Seriously? WTF man. You shouldn't sell quake without its soundtrack, because that is just grade A autism right there. Gameplay:10/10Bugs/problems are what kill this classic for me though.			"

												Quake is like Doom except the physics feel much nicer and you can jump, aim up and down and there's an increased emphasis on movement in general. The trade off is that there's smaller groups of enemies (rarely more than two at a time) and they're all a bit more bullet-spongey. The weapons can also be a tad unimaginative (no BFG here, just a gun that shoots lightning and chews through it's max amount of ammo in seconds).A lot of people dislike this game's visuals for relying a lot on the color brown. Personally, I don't mind this, as I feel that the more complex lighting and architecture of the maps (compared to Doom) compensates for this. That and the crappy low-poly monster models (that are still surprisingly well animated) combine with the rusted look of the game to create a wonderful aesthetic of low-tech creepiness. (I'd compare it to Silent Hill, but no part of Quake is ever set in a foggy town in the countryside - though there is at least one user-made map set in Innsmouth.)This game also has excellent sound design by NIN's Trent Reznor. Don't bother with that EpiQuake junk, the game's audio is perfect enough as it is ... and on that note, I have to explain exactly why I'm giving this a thumbs down, even though I've just been gushing about the game.It's because the Steam version doesn't include Trent Reznor's ambient soundtrack that Quake played off it's CD as in-game music. Unlike Hexen, there aren't any MIDI tracks or anything for the game to fall back on if the CD is missing - just nothing. The in-game sounds of wind and flickering torches are slightly more audible, and that's as good a compromise as you get.Now, I can understand the absence if it was a rights issue with Reznor, but that supposedly wasn't the case. Apparently, it was because when id put the Steam version of the game together (which runs in DOSBox) they couldn't figure out how to simply rip the tracks off the CD in OGG format and configure DOSBox to load those files in lieu of redbook audio. Maybe John Carmack was too busy working on his new engine for whatever that game no one cared about was called.Regardless, get Quake if you can find the original CD release on the cheap - which you probably will, as it's not a particularly rare game, nor one as valued by collectors as Doom (though be careful not to buy a  shareware version by accident). Alternatively, wait and see if this ever shows up on GOG.com - as those guys will probably put more effort into a basic digital release of this game than it's own developers.------------------TL;DR, Quake is a very good game, but don't buy it here or you will get a version without music.

												It doesnt have the best gunplay, but it has the best level design i ever seenif u can, get gog version of Quake,that comes with audio tracks by default (+ 1 bonus fanmade content) and its better to get old games from there anyway, music is not included on steam :(, but u can download it and install by ur self...the second expansion is broken as well here on steamotherwise this game is fantasticSick good levels and atmosphere with decent shooty against cool weird enemies ( and the music omg so good) i can see Romero and American Mcgee worked on quakenot many games can compete with this level design and gameplayfeels like doom a bit, but less enemies and more ""platforming"" (but not too much) in real  3D!i did not liked these games when i was kiddo, but today its my favorite ( lot of things make no sense in quake ""lore"" wise, it was a turn off for me)before i just looked the graphics and saw its ugly or played it like 5 minutes max by torrented version lolu can mod this game to have more better graphics etc...lot of mods therei highly suggest darkplaces engine which makes the game terrifying with the shadows, or use DirectQ engine for original look, this has lot of option in the menu which the original doesnt and supports more modern pc i guess.1 little sidenote: i didnt liked the 1. expansion at all it was terrible experience, the 2. expanison is good, however there is a map where you cant progress further due to bug			"

												Quake is a classic FPS that, alongside Doom, helped Id Software codify the genre. How, I don't know, because Quake is an unbelievably boring game.The game's plot is, ostensibly, about fighting the Lovecraftian Old God Shub-Niggurath as she does... things. Which are bad. Quasi-demonic invasion from beyond the veil of space. As a Lovecraft fan this would seem rather encouraging... if in practice the game had any real plot at all. In practice the game is almost gleefully self-aware in how much its plot is a thin excuse to commit mass murder.Quake's ""story"" is broken up into four Episodes, of which I have admittedly only played the first two. The difference between the two seems to mostly be the upgrade of a single enemy type, and a slightly different wall texture. Any actual plot developments are mostly limited to easily-missed text blurbs at the end of each Episode, which mostly just seem to foreshadow the final boss.Gameplay-wise, Quake is a tedious, linear run-and-gun set in an endless parade of largely identical brown hallways against the same five brown enemies (with a few exceptions, like the odd miniboss and the very rare ""Base"" levels featuring soldiers and dogs, all similarly brown), in levels that offer no trace of setting, motivation, or purpose besides a playground to kill things on. The entire game could be proceedurally generated and you'd never notice.The combat itself is rather annoying. You're equipped with three main ammo types throughout the game - shotgun shells, nails, and rockets - and have two weapons for each, the second being a straight upgrade of the first (except for the grenade launcher and rocket launcher, which have different firing methods with different situational uses). In theory this weapon selection is servicable, but in practice it's rather lacking. Shotguns are the mainstay weapons of the game, probably to minimize the need to actually aim. Nailguns are vastly more effective weapons, basically being automatic weapons that have a degree of aim-assist to them, however their ammo is considerably more sparse and is burnt through much more quickly.None of this is really a dealbreaker, the truly annoying part is that this game is old enough to have multiple floors overlapping one another, but functionally lack the ability to look up or down. Star Wars: Dark Forces had a similar conundrum mostly solved by the fact that most weapons would aim up or down for you in a limited cone, and your enemies had similar limitations. However, in Quake the most common enemy by far is the Ogre, a stocky brute with a middling level of health and equipped with a chainsaw and a grenade launcher. Bullets shoot straight, but grenades arc with gravity and bounce around corners. Cue every single level filled to the gills with Ogres on high ledges where as often as not you can't hit them, but they will gleefully pelt an endless stream of grenades down on your head.Don't make the mistake of me blaming my dislike of this game on it's difficulty. I died plenty, but I'm describing the game's combat as ""annoying,"" not ""difficult."" Quake's uncomplicated setup makes it difficult for anything to become legitimately unbalanced, but managable does not mean fun. And when you take combat that isn't particularly fun, a plot that barely exists, and repetitive, bland aesthetics, you get a game that has essentially no merits to recommend.			"

												EDIT: Yeah, that's right you salty lot, downvote this since it doesn't make you happy. I leave an honest, HELPFUL review about my settings so the developers can read this, and that the game doesn't work despite trying the settings they suggest in-game. But by all means, tell me my info isn't helpful since it's probably just negative to all of you.Upon starting the game and putting the resolution up to 1024, the game proceeds to run poorly. Tried the other mode but doesn't give me the option of changing video unless I go into the console, in which it won't accept any commands. I have a GTX 1080, so yes, I have enough power.Real shame, was hoping to play this milestone. But I'm not going to a low resolution when the game provides higher and gets choppy (on a game that's 20 years old).			"

												THIS.THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME.If H.P Lovecraft, the heavy metal of the nineties, and the intense atmosphere of Doom was smashed, reconstructed, smashed again and reconstructed again into a glorious product, it would be Quake.Unlike Doom, where it pitches at you various demons from hell, Quake throws in horrific eldritch beings in their place. We still have the loveable zombies from the last game, but instead of Cacodemons we have Scrags. Instead of Revenants, we have Vores. Instead of Cyberdemons, we have Shamblers.The weapons have changed as well. Instead of fists, you get a bloody axe that is more useless than trying to cut down a tree with a herring. The Pistol has been ditched for a Shotgun, which is unfortunatly not as fun to use as Doom's shotgun. The Super Shotgun returns as well, and it somewhat becomes a mainstay later on ingame. Instead of a chaingun, we get the Nailgun and Super Nailgun, which are FUN AS HELL TO USE. One new addition is the Grenade Launcher (Which bizarrely shares the Rocket Launchers ammo pool), which can take out groups of bad guys in no time. Theres not much to talk about the Rocket Launcher, aside from its amazing ""Rocket Jump"" capability. Finally, we have the Thunderbolt. Think of this tool as the games version to a Plasma Gun/BFG 9000 combo. It does not have much ammo, so use it in the most lethal of situations. The game has such a forboding atmosphere, at times I felt as though something would actually sneak up on me and rip me to shreds. Combine it with the soundtrack made by Nine Inch Nails, and this game will make you feel more nihilistic than the ending of the first F.E.A.R.

												Ah, the Classic Quake. The first true 3D FPS game. 13 years on, how well has it aged?Surprisingly well actually. I suppose the first thing to note is that the game played a lot like DooM, I personally like to consider it one of the 3 DooM 3's also consisting of DooM64 and the actual DooM 3. But I Digress.Quake, as the first FPS to use actual Ploygons manages to hold up quite well, you have the basic DooM style controls, using the arrow keys to turn, Ctrl to shoot and WASD to move (That is unless you're using the Ultimate Quake Patch, but I'll get to that later). and it does feel like a well-rounded experience that manages to hold up today. Of course it has graphically aged poorly with Jerky animation (this can be fixed with the UQP) but to fully enjoy the game you have to put your mindset back in 1996 where the best looking 3D was Virtua Fighter, This game puts you in a realisting looking (for the time) environments and gives frigtening enemies that have never been seen before.Story Wise the game doesn't offer much, but the game doesn't really need to, you're just a guy (Who I like to call Quakeguy) who must stop evil creatures from an Alternate Dimension. It is sweet and simple.All weapons handle well, from the Shotgun, Nailgun, Their 'Super' Counterparts, Rocket Launcher, Grenade Launcher, all are simplistic in their design and manage to hit their target with a bit of help from auto aim (Again, UQP). The game features a fun Fast paced game that is perfect for speedrunners and delivers on the retro feeling and boasts great level design.The Enemies themselves are actually made creepier with an effect that would not exist if the game had more polygons, The Gothic scenery makes the mood and feel of the game and gives the game It's own unique identity.Unfortunatly the game has some problems cause by some sort of steam optimisation. The Music is Non-Existant, even though there exists OST tracks on YouTube, none are featured in this game. This is Where the Ultimate Quake Patch comes into effect. The UQP fixes a lot of the Steam problems as well as some more of the poorly aged parts: Enemies have now got fluent animation, Mouse Control is Enabled, Improved Lighting and Particle effects as well as the OST added. Personally though I thought the 1996 graphics and improved lighting and effects were too distracting and I had no idea how to get the game to look like the Original game with just the Soundtrack so I removed it. The game still has a great Charm to it and is memorable for it's environments and enemies. The game is still fun without the UQP but may turn people off with the lack of soundtrack.I suppose the bottom line is that Quake is a Good, if not Great game the has fun retro gameplay but naturally has not aged well in many areas. This leads to 3 possiblities for interest in the consumers purchase:1) Buy the game on GOG where it (apparently) plays Just like the Steam release but with working OST2) Buy on Steam with UQP, if you aren't bothered by the clashing graphics and enjoy updated versions of old games then this should be fine for you3) Just buy the Steam release as it is and Play some 'Through the Fire and Flames' to the game and enjoy it for what it is.Quake is a Landmark in the FPS genre that doesn't hold up as well as it's older brothers DooM and Wolfenstein but leaves it's mark in it's creative level design and fun fast gameplay.FINAL VERDICT: RECCOMEND			"

												Quake was the first game that I had to upgrade my computer to a Pentium to play. I fired it up today because I feeling a little bit bitter about Bioshock: Infinite's sloppy gunplay and moronic, inconsistant story.The graphics are dated and it doesn't support widescreen resolutions but the gameplay is as crisp and enjoyable as it ever was. This is a game from the era where story was a splash screen of text in between major chapters. Your mission is clear: Here is a gun. Kill all the things because they obviously deserve it.			"

												Quake is one of the first FPS games that is fully rendered in 3D.  Now it is more of an interactive museum piece than an entertaining game, but still has a little charm for those who really fell in love with the FPS genre when it grew big.  The guns are creative and semi-traditional, as well as the enemies.  This is also one of the first games to offer enemies that will fight each other when they get caught in crossfire.  This game also was one of the first games to be openly modded, but most mods have not been carried over from the past.  Multiplayer mods have to be downloaded separately from the base game.  I still enjoy this game once in awhile, but this is one of those gems that is simply more hard rock than actual diamond.			"

												When it comes to first person shooter games, I've almost always preferred the old to the new. Games like Doom, Duke Nukem 3D, Team Fortress Classic, and most importantly, this game. Quake is one of my favorite games of all time, and a top contender for my favorite first person shooter. If you are a gamer that enjoys reloading constantly, passively regenerating health, being guided linearly from point A to point B in the story, and generally playing behind a safety net, then good for you. But Quake is a fast paced, old school, top of the class shooter that refuses to hold your hand. The fast paced gameplay, the need for exploration to find every secret to help you through, the challenging, hard hitting enemies and weapons, and the fact that you can die extremely quickly if you screw up. That is what a good shooter is to me, and I can't think of a better example of where that shines than Quake. If you haven't played this game before, I can't recommend it enough, and if you're a long time fan of the Quake series like me, then you understand why I feel the way I do about this game. 10/10.

												Quake was one of my favorite classic shooters I played.  I'm a millenial, so It's very hard for me to get into classic games.  I didnt like doom and half life, yet there was something about quake I liked.  The control are great, I loved the level design, and it was very very diffucult.  There wasnt much of a story, but it seemed to be about interdeminsonal demons taking over different worlds, and you trying to stop them.  Playing this game still feels good in 2017, so I recomend it for anyone.			"

I know it says I only played quake for like an hour, but that is because i used the darkplaces mod, which I also highly reccommend. In short its an awesome shooter made my the awesome guys at awesome id software who soak up each others awesomeness.			"

												This is the game that started it all for me. I played it for just a little bit and was instantly hooked. Since I have honed my skills with months of gameplay and wouldnt ever give that time well spent up. I adore this game and would recomend it to EVERYONE. It is fast paced, High energy, and well crafted to feed the homicidal maniac within each of us. BUY IT. NOW!			"

												Just finished the game on hard difficult and i feel only the lastest levels are real challenge and nothing too hard. The game have unique atmosphere, have some essences  from Doom ( traps,close corridors,fast paced shooting,). I recomend the game only for oldschool gamers and for kind of person who want to know about  more of the franchise and  the history of quake series.			"

												Excellent level design, movement, weapons, and music.  Truly a wonderful classic shooter. I used the Quakespasm sourceport to play this and had no issues. I used ""Simple Quake Launcher"" to start the game instead of using Winquake (renamed the file to ""testapp""). I also use Quake Injector to download user maps, and you can play the game from there too. To me these are the best ways to play this on modern computers. Darkplaces is a fine sourceport too, but the fiend enemies are a bit glitched from my experience.			"

												This game still stands as a unique, abstract shooter with a thickly-dark atmosphere.   No storyline; just a series of demonic mazes and fast action.  I lost much of my youth caught up in the multiplayer aspect of this game.  Gameplay-wise, it's a  basic but smooth formula.  It offers a challenge that is purely skill based; not just on your aim; but your timing, prediction and almost gymnastic movement around the levels.I still think it's a technical marvel.  This was one of the first full-3D games; and the levels are deliberately vertical and abstract in their design.  Everything has long since been open sourced; as a coder it's intriguing to inspect the design from a kind of archeological perspective.When starting, you're given the option to choose which executable to run;  QuakeWorld (which was its brilliant online version - though surely not noob friendly), didn't work for me.   Perhaps with some technical tinkering you can get this to work.  (It was never straightforward back in the day anyway)I've tested the GLQuake option, is the hardware rendering option, this works without any issues.  I'm sure there are mods out there that improve the experience, though.Gamers today will probably never feel the same sense of awe and wonder and compelling multiplayer gameplay as we did when it released.  I'm kinda glad that games have moved on though, this game has a slightly discomforting pull, like it's almost half-living, a demon demanding my return.   As a skeptical atheist, it's beyond disturbing.My time with this game is done;  it was a strange friend that was always present, but I hardly miss.  It still quietly haunts my subconscious to this day.   Damn.			"

												Truly one of my favorite video games of all time. For the time, the graphics were stunning and unfathomable. Even in an age of much better graphics, I still thoroughly enjoy looking about the levels and marveling at the superb design. The soundtrack is very fitting with the atmosphere that is placed around and creates a sense of immersion. The story is not clearly explained and is not emotional or anything but compelling enough to keep you blasting through enemies and exploring the environment. The gameplay is what to be expected, a fantasically crafted simple yet enjoyable first person shooter that screams everything is classic about this game. I would recommend this game to anyone in the world, even if they do not play video games often. This is a must play for anyone and everyone, this fine piece of gaming history should be known to all.  Quake is not just a game, but a whole culture that has culminated a certain part of video game history that still stands today in 2016. As one of my favorite games, even today, I can recommend this game to anyone. The graphics are not the absolute best, but were still revolutionary at the time. The sound is nostalgic to all of those that stayed up late nights playing with their friends blasting eachother with the crazy fun arsenal of weapnry. The environments took you to places that were quite unique for the time and somehow made sense to be designed the way that they were and not only that, but enjoyable to the average gamer. Furthermore, I think if the graphics get to you now, there are still modders that have improved on that to either get new players to experience it or bring some older players a new experience.			"

												An absolutely fantastic game with smooth gameplay despite it`s age. The overall design and atmosphere within the game is astounding and can be genuinely frightening if played on higher difficulty settings such as nightmare, not through arbitrary and scripted sequences, but through the enemy design and gameplay. HOWEVER, I must stress that despite this, a newer sourceport such as quakespasm or darkspaces is recommended due to the original engine not having aged too well.I personally recommend Darkplaces due to it`s compatibility and options such as FOV sliders and customisable lighting and effects, allowing you to give the game some visual upgrades.The weapons all serve great purpose and some damage enemies better than others, combined with the unique behaviour of each, the player is left with a game of great challenge and intrigue. The game features a well composed soundtrack by Nine inch nails and their logo can be seen on ammunition containers throughout.While the game is definitely not perfect, it is a game that any oldschooler would be incredibly comfortable with, however newschool players may find it less.Overall a solid gold piece of the past, not for everyone but for me, it was a good time.

												Ah, Quake...how much we, the gamers of the 21st century owe thee So much of the technology and so many of the conventions we now take for granted were developed for this game. So many great games were built within the Quake engine or its immediate derivatives. It is truly a landmark of gaming history. Some of the greatest geniusus of game development history invested their talents into this game and changed the industry forever.But that's not why you should buy Quake. You should buy this game because it is still one of the best shooters ever made. It's stilll scary and exciting in equal measure. Its design is still darkly original, it's arsenal still finely balanced, and its gameplay still wickely slick.Once you are done with the ~9 hour campaign, why not check out the multiplayer that remains active more than twenty years after the game's release (if that's not proof enough of Quake's superiority, then nothing is). Or perhaps you could head over to Quaddicted.com and try any one of the 1200 user-made single player maps and map packs.For two decades Quake has been an unexhaustable source of pleasure for gamers and I full expect to still be basking in its glory twenty years hence.

												Quake is the game that got me started with playing video games. Started playing this when I was 5 years old on a crap windows 95 computer. Game was dark and distructive. Blowing zombies and orwellion horrors to bits with rocket launchers and nail guns. Parents and me would get into competitions of seeing how fast we could get the game completed. Some of the best memories of growing up go back to this game.Quake will always be there when I need to cheer myself up or need to wind down after a day of work.10 / 10 would play again and again			"

												(I played this through Darkplaces so my hours will not show up on here.) Quake is one of the best FPS games I have ever played. The setting and weapons were just so unique. The soundtrack is absolutly superb and was composed by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. Quake's story and gameplay is very similar to DOOM's except this was created in a true 3D engine. IMPORTANT: As of right now the soundtrack does not work with the Steam version so if your not willing to fiddle with a Source Port and some audio downloads your going to be out of luck as far as music is concerned. The game is very Lovecraftian themed (Cthulhu, etc). You'll encounter demonic knights with swords, strange creatures of all shapes and sizes, zombified soldiers, and THE SHAMBLER. Quake has an episode based level design so you will go through one episode tackling a whole bunch of levels and then be put back into a hub area in order to select the next episode. There are four episodes in total. This game oozes immersion and atmosphere. You may play hours of it without notice sometimes. I would recommend this game to anyone into 90's FPS such as DOOM or Duke. This game is not just a game. It is an experience.			"

The classic shooter that I reccomend if you want to get good at fast paced first person shooters such as any Team Fortress, Counter Strike, or any other shooter, really. Funny enough, this game was the reason Team Fortress exists! Team Fortress was a mod for this game made by about 10 people. It's as fast paced as Scout in TF. In fact, if you play scout, play this. It only costs 10 dollars. It's amazing. 1on1 multiplayer matches as well as an awesome 1 player mode! And it's very hard. I have to play on Easy. And there are lots of puzzles. I'm still stuck on episode 2 of this game! Overall, any fps fans absoulutley NEED this game.			"

												Quake is essentially DOOM with some way-ahead-of-its-time 3-D graphics. While the game is great, I liked DOOM and Duke Nukem 3D(Not an ""id Software"" title) much more.Quake doesn't really have much going for it in setting and monsters. I like the whole goth/demon setting but it gets boring and uninteresting after awhile, even if the levels are designed well. DOOM has the advantage over Quake because the levels are more elaborate and fun to killyour way through with more interesting demons, and Duke 3D has the advantage over Quake because of its humour, creativity and extreme interactiveness that manages to make the player much more immersed even without the early 3D technology Quake has. Here the monsters were okay at best. Nothing to write home about. Although the final boss, while a letdown did look extremely cool.That isn't to say that this is bad, Quake still has your fun puzzle-based gameplay that Doom and Duke have to offer. If you play the game on the ""Hard"" difficulty you'll have a fun little challenge playing through the campaign. I'm sure if you would have played this game when it came out you would have crapped in your pants at the graphics. However, given the fact that Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior both include the game and their expansions redone for a mere 9.99, Quake only gives you the base game for 9.99 and makes you pay 4.99 for each respective expansion. I'd recommend saving this one for the old Steam Sale.Other things of note: It kind of sucks that the face of your character that gets progressively more and more bloodied from damage doesn't move or blink like that of Doomguy's from Doom and also the grunting noise your character makes when you jump will never leave your brain.

Persoanlly I am now having a blast with it. Note to Steam users- use the patches located: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1756923To be able to hear the NIN OST and switch out WinQuake for Darkplaces (which is far superior)			"

												Just as I remembered from the 90s. Went from Doom, Doom II to this. Great classic. First game to play via dial-up deathmatch. Also for those complaining that there is not music go get a mod off the internet that not only improve graphics but has the music with it! How dare you give a thumbs down to this game...shame on you.			"

												Quite a revolutionary game for its time with a full inventory selection and graphics.  I enjoy the vast enemie types, and Icould see the fast movement combat which would soon to be exaggerated with the serious sam series.  I recemmend this game if you do not mind the dated graphics and enjoy fast passed aciton against its demon looking enemie types.  I personly have a lot of fun with this game and its the type you would never forget.  "

												Standing the test of time, Quake continues to serve a great gaming experience in the FPS genre. Displaying core qualities of great game development, the learning curve is enjoyable and offers excitement with each enemy at every corner. Whether you are a die-hard FPS fan or the casual gamer looking to hear what all the fuss is about, Quake is a game you must experience.			"

												Roughly 32 hours in, I finally managed to beat all of Episode 1 (including Ziggurat Vertigo) on Nightmare difficulty.  To think I played the first level or two of this game over and over as a kid, having no idea how hard this game acutally is, is pretty crazy to think about.This game plays PERFECTLY on Windows 10 with no mods/additions of any kind, never froze or crashed on me, and I was honestly suprised about that considering the age of the game.  I play using a GeForce GT 650M (Laptop), and once you find the right aspect ratio, the game is actually very kind on the eye (assuming no graphics mods).The movement is so fluid, as is with all Quake titles, but this is the game that started it all, and if you only played it a little bit as a kid, then you definitely need to play it now (if you love a good FPS).Basically I spent $9.99 (bought it off sale) and 32 hours later I like it so much I was compelled to type a review for it.  I have been playing it completely bare-bones, even with OG graphics and I have loved every moment of it.  Highly recommended, and from my experience, you shouldn't need to worry about weather it will play on your rig or not.			"

												Amazing game, feels and runs better than a lot modern games which says a lot.I did use The Ulimate Quake Patch from the steam forums, there are version for quake as well as the two mission packs.""The Ultimate Quake Patch will restore music to the Steam version and add the features of the DarkPlaces engine mentioned above. This fixes compatibility problems found on modern versions of Windows and restores the soundtrack."" -quote PCGamingWikiI recommend this patch, I didn't really play without so I can't compare, but I'm under the impression it helps a fair amount, and puts the GLQuake source port that's available by default up to par with some of the other source ports people have down for the game.

The game that invented speedy insane strafejump-shooting, and it is still fun. I recently completed the campaign again using QuakeHD mods, and now the game looks amazing as well. Look into the mods if you decide to go through Quake again - it doesnt touch the gameplay, but makes it easier on the eyes.			"

												Quake was a fun game to play through. I'd jump right into the mission expansions, but there's one thing keeping me from doing so right away:Spawns. Those annoying little snotpiles that don't appear until Episode 4.I'm sick of looking at them, sick of hearing them, sick of them ganging up on me and practically molesting me, and sick of them exploding on death like their boss has a thick beard and a towel on his head.Quake is the only game where I've had the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ displeasure of being attacked by raspberry-flavored explosive Jell-O. I swear on my life, if I see even one Spawn in Scorge of Armagon or Dissolution of Eternity, I'm going to take a long walk off of a shot Slipgate.			"

												Quake is everything that the fans of the series claimed it would be. Quake follows the ranger (the protagonist) as he goes about collecting the 4 legendary runes in order to stop the Shub-Niggurath. The theme of interdimensional beings invading Earth seemed to be a popular theme among the time. The game is split into 4 episodes and the final boss fight. You can access any episode from the hub which has a great layout that I really enjoyed. Each episode is a decent length with around 7 or 8 levels, and the levels themselves usually have a few puzzles in order to keep you from just speed running it like in the DOOM franchise. The movement is fast paced allowing for you to easily out maneuver your opponent, while also keeping things from getting stale. The weapons in Quake are all unique in their own way some more useful than others. The enemies of Quake seem to share an eldritch horror style and are each unique with some requiring certain weapons to defeat them. The graphics in Quake invoke a nostalgic feel but are also heavily outdated. I did not play the multiplayer as I am sure that there are few servers if any at all still running. Quake does everything right that I wanted from a game like Doom and I had a fun time going through the story and playing through this gem of a game.			"

												I was going to leave this review for later when I had more hours in but now seemed like a good time. First, Its a great game. The level design is one of the best I've seen and when ever I go back to levels before I always find something new. To newer gamers in the fps genre might find it difficult though. I would be lying if I said I knew where I was going 100 percent of the time. No I grew up playing Call of Duty 3 and Medal of Honor Frontline. Games that show you A to B in the simplest way possible. Quake is such a breath of fresh air, from the ""modern military shooter,"" I wish I could easly hook on to a server but that won't happen anytime soon. In the end its a timeless classic that will stand the test of time for the next generation of gamers.(hopefully it will stillbe played in the future).			"

The map design, sound design and aesthetics really spring to life when played in VR. I can hardly recommend this enough.Keep in mind that Quake on Steam doesn't support VR. You only need the pak files from the Steam game, then add them to the Quakegasm engine with the VR modifications. Then run Quakegasm and voila! You're teleported to the freakish world of Quake. Works absolutely flawless! Remember to tinker a bit with the VR control setup to find a setup you like. These guys got it right! Flawless implementation.			"

I miss the old level by level first person shooters and enemy infighting was just so awesome.  I was never low on ammo because it was more fun to let the enemies kill eachother.  The Baddies have a code they don't mess with their own kind (except Grunts and Grems) but if another enemy shoots an enemy of a differnt breed they will ignore you for revenge. Quake 1 is a true classic one of the best games ever made and still holds up to this day.			"

												The obvious stuff-A great FPS, I'll say. Better than most choices these days, but IMO it doesn't beat its sequel or Unreal. Why is that, for me anyway? Because its sequel was my first game ever, I learned to love the sci-fi look on it and get used to it rather than the Lovecraftian style that I came to experience some time after. Same goes for the music, a lot of people are going to hate me for this but I dislike most of the music for this game, with the exception of its main theme and the 'base' theme of every first level of each area. I really like those two, the theme's badass and the base music is relaxing, in a way. I really hate one of the tracks, the one with the piano and then you hear a voice that's like hearing someone dragging their finger nail down a chalkboard. Seriously, that's what I hear everytime I hear the song and its headache-giving, to me anyway, don't let that affect what you might experience. Sorry if I did. :/This game IS less repetitive than Doom, I'll give it that, its great for what it is, MUCH better than CoD, BF, and so on. I know I kinda already said that before but I really need to get that out there. This game's great, but only if you have bought and played others that might be better.The Stuff you'd probably need to know before you buy the darn game-You start out at a Hub that lets you select your difficulty, you proceed to such difficulty and you enter another hub that allows you to select the area of which will allow you to gain a rune. Such runes allow you to gain enough power to gain access to find the game's boss. You collect the runes by reaching the end of the area, that being the area's last level. The first area is the only one that has a scripted boss, the others are all walking enemies, though they can be considered bosses too, the game can get much harder depending on the area's number. You can finish the game pretty quickly, and its also easily speedrunnable if you know how to. Its overall very fun and as I said, only get it if you already played stuff that could be better. Get it on a sale if you want, I am known for being cheap like an old man so I dunno, I always tell people to buy stuff on a sale because its totally worth it. :p			"

												It has been many years since I played the first Quake...literally up until now I probably haven't played it since the first year or two the game was out.THE drawback from this game on Steam is no music at all which was a dissapointment.However I hold a candle to this particular game because none of them equalled the first.They were good but couldn't capture the magic of the first because they didn't stick to the formula.Lots of great level design and light sourcing as the first taste of 3D polygonal shooters.Riddled with traps and an interesting variety of monsters and coming back to this game I'd say the same monsters would still be good if they kept 'breeding the variety'.Who doesn't like a chainsaw weilding maniac lobbing grenades at you...hearing that tell-tale clang..clang..clang..as they ricochet off walls or bounce on the floor.Or even better-the nailgun and super nailgun as that's a sub for a machine gun...that just adds butchery to this dark 3D shooter.

												Oh Quake, how I love thee.  Quake II was my introduction into First-Person Shooter, and after I had absorbed as much of it as I could I went to its predecessor and played that.  And boy are they different games.The funny thing about Quake is how different the games have been.  First there is Quake with a gothic feel that isn’t far from the Doom mold. Then you have Quake 2, which wasn’t intended on being a Quake game until they were unable to gain the rights they were looking for, and decided to just use the name Quake II.  It has a very technological theme with aliens.  After which there was Quake III Arena, which took all the great things created and learned from Quake and Quake II’s multiplayer, making almost a third setting/storyline, with characters from previous ID titles.  And finally there is Quake 4, which is a direct sequel to Quake II, back the the technological aliens.  And there is rumor of the next Quake game going back to the gothic style.While the story isn’t entirely there, Quake is ultimately an excellent game.  And maybe it’s simply because I just played all the great games in the right order.  Where each game fed into the next, and really displayed how they were truly remarkable.			"

												Being, as it is, the last game before John Romero's ill-fated departure from the legendary id Software, this is as much a piece of gaming history as it is a game.don't be fooled by that description, this is one hell of a game, while its graphics and gameplay are dated now, there is still that visceral thrill similar to DOOM that is timeless. sure, newer and arguably better games have been and gone since the mid-1990s, there is still something compelling about Quake, something that hasn't really been captured since Timesplitters: Future Perfect. while the steam version isn't perfect (it's lacking the music from the cd version, something that can be rectified with mods), it is still a visceral thrill to play, and in a first for id software, you start with the shotgun, meaning the awesome starts right at the beginning.the fast-paced action present in this game that, may i remind you, is nearly 20 years old will keep you coming back for decades to come. it is as timeless as super mario bros.

												I was going to leave this review for later when I had more hours in but now seemed like a good time. First, Its a great game. The level design is one of the best I've seen and when ever I go back to levels before I always find something new. To newer gamers in the fps genre might find it difficult though. I would be lying if I said I knew where I was going 100 percent of the time. No I grew up playing Call of Duty 3 and Medal of Honor Frontline. Games that show you A to B in the simplest way possible. Quake is such a breath of fresh air, from the ""modern military shooter,"" I wish I could easly hook on to a server but that won't happen anytime soon. In the end its a timeless classic that will stand the test of time for the next generation of gamers.(hopefully it will stillbe played in the future).			"

Sufficient ammo per level, and an absolutely vicious Hard Mode (just beaten it again on this difficulty before review), backing up that ammo statement (needed every shell/nail/rocket/cell, especially at the end), and Nightmare Mode.Always a fun challenge: 1 on 1 a shambler or 3 fiends at once with an axe.Or start some fun infights, like this one:Ogre (grenade launcher and chainsaw)vsZombie (fights by throwing chunks of himself at you)Guess the winner in that infight I started.Answer: The Zombie, believe it or not.

												I was really mad as video game consoles evolved and stopped supporting their earlier games. Microsoft carried on that tradition when I finally got a computer ( Went from win3.1 to Windows95 in a hurry).  I was well behind the curve;  Windows 98 was just entering it's first platform upgrade, and I finally got Quake 2 on closeout. I had a ball, and the fun didn't stop for me, as I began buying the add on packs. Even after I played 'Allied Assault', and other games ( after prices came down), I always replayed all of the Quake series until Windows XP began obsoleting my collection of games one by one. when steam offered them, I snatched them up, and still load 'em up when I'm in the mood for  something less involving, but I know will keep me amused for a couple of more hours.

												The Steam release of Quake could definitely use some work. Unless you prefer the original, mid-90's pixelated graphics and low resolution, you'll need to download a seperate game engine, since the included GLQuake doesn't operate properly unless you have a pc from that era, parts included. There is also a distinct lack of a soundtrack for this release, which ruins the overall atmosphere. There are patches out on the internet that can easily fix all the issues with this release, it's just too bad they didn't do a thing to prepare the game for Steam. I still recommend the game; it's nostalgic for some, difficult for many, and fun for all.			"

And finally there is Quake 4, which is a direct sequel to Quake II, back the the technological aliens.  And there is rumor of the next Quake game going back to the gothic style.While the story isn’t entirely there, Quake is ultimately an excellent game.  And maybe it’s simply because I just played all the great games in the right order.  Where each game fed into the next, and really displayed how they were truly remarkable.			"

												Ah... Nostalgia. Simply put.Great level design, despite being somewhat maze-like. Sufficient ammo per level, and an absolutely vicious Hard Mode (just beaten it again on this difficulty before review), backing up that ammo statement (needed every shell/nail/rocket/cell, especially at the end), and Nightmare Mode.Always a fun challenge: 1 on 1 a shambler or 3 fiends at once with an axe.Or start some fun infights, like this one:Ogre (grenade launcher and chainsaw)vsZombie (fights by throwing chunks of himself at you)Guess the winner in that infight I started.Answer: The Zombie, believe it or not. I am not making this up. Those skinny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are durable, right? And yes, it not only survived, but killed the ogre by throwing his own zombie chunks at him. It was oddly amusing. Lasted 5 minutes. I had to open a beer for this (which I did. Worth it.). I have strange ways to amuse myself. "

												Quake is a load of fun. Its fast pace, rocket-jumping, b-hopping awesomeness. The game keeps in going with its unique levels. It has a good variety of weapons. And the enemies are original. The game is great. The only way to truly play is by unlocking your mouse into free look. But everyone does that. I recommend this game to anyone who wants a good original shoot em up game. Also learning to speed run levels is a blast. This is a must buy game!			"

												I was really mad as video game consoles evolved and stopped supporting their earlier games. Microsoft carried on that tradition when I finally got a computer ( Went from win3.1 to Windows95 in a hurry).  I was well behind the curve;  Windows 98 was just entering it's first platform upgrade, and I finally got Quake 2 on closeout. I had a ball, and the fun didn't stop for me, as I began buying the add on packs. Even after I played 'Allied Assault', and other games ( after prices came down), I always replayed all of the Quake series until Windows XP began obsoleting my collection of games one by one. when steam offered them, I snatched them up, and still load 'em up when I'm in the mood for  something less involving, but I know will keep me amused for a couple of more hours.  I just have to reccomend these classics- get 'em on Steam. They are cheap and still great.			"

												Quake is undeniable. If you're on this store page, you shouldn't need me to tell you how great Quake is, but I am here to assure you that, with a few little patches, you can still play the Quake of your memories.The Steam version, like most digital copies, doesn't include the soundtrack, and GabeN obviously doesn't much care for physical media, so there's not much chance of him sending you a CD. Don't dismay, though. There are all kinds of guides to get the soundtrack up and running, and what a difference it makes! The memories of countless hours spent fragging came flooding back. A few graphical tweaks, and the game actually looks as good as I thought it did the first time I saw it played.If you ever enjoyed Quake, or if you're some kind of child or mutant who's never played before, you owe it to yourself to drop the paltry sum, and experience this masterpiece of foundational game design (foundational to its genre, at any rate) again, or for the first time.

												This is Quake. It plays like Quake. It is comparable to Quake and Quake.... okay okay. This was ID Software's Big 3D Experiment, and it's... not Doom. What it is, is a weird horror/atmospheric thing that makes creative use of its 3D to hide secrets in places that make you go ""WTF why is there a secret there?""Sometimes it's kind of dull and brown, but it is Quake. Nothing's really quite like it.You can make this VERY PRETTY by going to http://www.xpfree.org/epsilon/ and downloading one of their graphical add-on packs.

												What's there to say about Quake? One of the most world-renowned and memorable FPS' of all time. But why is that the case? Let's take a detailed look and see:1. Gameplay - Let's trim the fat and get right to the guts right off the bat; Quake's gameplay is that of your typical 90's old-school FPS: Fast, bloody, complex and hard as hell, and you will love it (if you're into FPS games, that is). You get a wide array of weapons from a harmless Axe to the dreaded Thunderbolt, which turns any enemy into mincemeat in seconds, including the dreaded Shambler. Also like any old-school FPS, it is rife with secret areas that are a chore to find, but well worth the rewards within! Most times, at least. Tons of pick ups like the Pentagram of Protection (Invulnerability), Ring of Shadows (Invisibility), and the all-too-memorable Quad Damage, allowing you to unleash doomsday to every enemy in sight -- and yourself, too, if you aren't careful! -- dealing a massive 400% damage with any weapon you choose! There is a wide variety of enemies you will also encounter, from the annoying Grunt to the creepy Vore. Hint: When you see a Fiend (the bipedal, ape-like thing with lacerator arms) run like hell. One leap attack, and you're near dead. No joke.2. Graphics - Usually graphics aren't one thing to take too seriously in reviews. In my philosophy, so long as you can see where you are going, and nothing looks TOO pixelated, they're perfectly tolerable. Buuuuuuuuut, that being said, download the Ultimate Quake Patch to be able to play this game in buttery-smooth 1920x1080 (if you have a full HD monitor that is). Never before has a game from the 90's looked so crisp and clear. And to think at one point I thought the 320x240 resolution of Quake on the N64 was the best thing ever. *shudders*3. Difficulty - Hoo, boy...if you are brave enough to play this game on Nightmare (which you should to get the full experience, as cliche as that may sound, I know), this game will keep you on the edge of your seat nearly at all times, especially once you start encountering the bigger, badder enemies in later levels. Also, beware the Spawns (the bouncy slime-things). Just...just trust me on this.4. Replay value - I could start this beauty up and play it any day of the week and have fun with it. It's fast-paced, bloody FPS action at its finest, and one of the true granddaddies of the FPS genre, along with Doom, Wolfenstein 3D and Duke Nukem 3D.Bottom Line: You want this game. It's usually like, $3 or something. Absolute steal and a half. As are the expansions! But I'll review those by themselves.			"

												Okay, so you got Trent Reznor doing the soundtrack, the soundtrack is done by Trent Reznor... oh, and the music was done by Trent Reznor. Did I mention Trent Reznor did the sound design for this game?Pushing aside my hard-on for Nine Inch Nails, Quake is pretty much FPS heaven. While this formula has passed just like the year 1996, I played this sucker for the first time around a year ago (writing in 2014) and I can easily say this is probably my favorite FPS up there with Half-Life 2... which takes a lot from games like DOOM and Quake, so I'm probably going to get stoned for putting those two games together. Major red flag, I suggest... I COMMAND that you get the Ultimate Quake Patch. Without it you'd be playing a dated version with no music... and don't get me started on the music.Here's a link to the patch, enjoy killing hellspawn: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1756923 "

It is fast paced, High energy, and well crafted to feed the homicidal maniac within each of us. BUY IT. NOW!			"

												Just finished the game on hard difficult and i feel only the lastest levels are real challenge and nothing too hard. The game have unique atmosphere, have some essences  from Doom ( traps,close corridors,fast paced shooting,). I recomend the game only for oldschool gamers and for kind of person who want to know about  more of the franchise and  the history of quake series.			"

												Excellent level design, movement, weapons, and music.  Truly a wonderful classic shooter. I used the Quakespasm sourceport to play this and had no issues. I used ""Simple Quake Launcher"" to start the game instead of using Winquake (renamed the file to ""testapp""). I also use Quake Injector to download user maps, and you can play the game from there too. To me these are the best ways to play this on modern computers. Darkplaces is a fine sourceport too, but the fiend enemies are a bit glitched from my experience.			"

												Quake was one of my favorite classic shooters I played.  I'm a millenial, so It's very hard for me to get into classic games.  I didnt like doom and half life, yet there was something about quake I liked.  The control are great, I loved the level design, and it was very very diffucult.  There wasnt much of a story, but it seemed to be about interdeminsonal demons taking over different worlds, and you trying to stop them.  Playing this game still feels good in 2017, so I recomend it for anyone.			"

												The Good old days, it surprised me how much I still love the hell out of the old days FPS games. It's been so long since I last played Quake, it shows why these games where so popular back in the then.I guess I will pick up on playing some more old skool FPS games after this one.It might look very dated, it still plays awesome, especially with an extra engine like Quakespasm.Just remember that no one will hold your hand, like in most modern shooters, no checkpoints. Quick saving at the right moment, saves you from having to do a large part over.But be warned a wrong quick save can screw you over as well :PIt's a shame that console gaming mostly destroyed what was once a standard for FPS games.

												Simply put, my favorite FPS of all time.  Impeccable level design, great enemies with really good AI for the time, and an environment and mob placement that actually lends itself to be legitimately scary.  It has surprises that you're usually ready for, but you're not the golden god you are in most FPS games where after the initial startle, you realize you can not be stopped and then wait until the next cheap shock.  Brilliant weapons, an awesome soundtrack and very cool odes to Lovecraftian lore make this a title that no gamer should ever have to claim they have not played.  If you love the Halos and Call of Duties now and have not taken a step back in time to play this gem, then make sure to put it on  your list.  You won't regret it.			"

												recent playthrough left me in love with the game all over again, ive played this game countless times since my early childhood and nothing else compares in terms of single player FPSthe movement tech, allowing you to flow with style through maps as smoothly as a hot ♥♥♥♥ through vaseline... even games later in the series dont let you bhop and strafe jump as good as this classic. great for anyone who loves FPS with great movement and shooting mechanics. absolutely nothing else comes close to how tuned quake is for FUN fps gameplay.get it, play it, love itone consideration, the steam version comes with WinQuake, GLquake, and Quakeworld/GLquakeworld versions. none of these versions use music off the HDD, which means the default steam install does NOT include the amazing trent reznor soundtrack. it is a MUST to download the darkplaces sourceport and the missing music patch from the steam forums if you want the complete experience. darkplaces has some issues with multiplayer but you can easily swap to quakeworld/GLquakeworld if you want to play over over the internet.if you want to deathmatch it will probably be best to just go buy quake live though.

												Roughly 32 hours in, I finally managed to beat all of Episode 1 (including Ziggurat Vertigo) on Nightmare difficulty.  To think I played the first level or two of this game over and over as a kid, having no idea how hard this game acutally is, is pretty crazy to think about.This game plays PERFECTLY on Windows 10 with no mods/additions of any kind, never froze or crashed on me, and I was honestly suprised about that considering the age of the game.  I play using a GeForce GT 650M (Laptop), and once you find the right aspect ratio, the game is actually very kind on the eye (assuming no graphics mods).The movement is so fluid, as is with all Quake titles, but this is the game that started it all, and if you only played it a little bit as a kid, then you definitely need to play it now (if you love a good FPS).Basically I spent $9.99 (bought it off sale) and 32 hours later I like it so much I was compelled to type a review for it.  I have been playing it completely bare-bones, even with OG graphics and I have loved every moment of it.  Highly recommended, and from my experience, you shouldn't need to worry about weather it will play on your rig or not.			"

This fixes compatibility problems found on modern versions of Windows and restores the soundtrack."" -quote PCGamingWikiI recommend this patch, I didn't really play without so I can't compare, but I'm under the impression it helps a fair amount, and puts the GLQuake source port that's available by default up to par with some of the other source ports people have down for the game.

												Quake has a lot of the fast paced action and neato weapons that are missing from a lot of single player FPS experiences these days, and its influence on a handful of titles overtime really shows. I'm going to inject a controversial opinion though and say that the game kinda gets monotonous toward the end. The enemies stop being enthralling around then and hunting for the keys feels more like a chore than anything in a game where you shoot lods of dmones.			"

												Such an Iccon of its time and every bit as groundbreaking as Doom was. This is where MP deathmatch began with the likes of Doom and Quake. The Singleplayer level design is built in such a way that it is always fun to explore. The levels are riddled with secret passages, areas and even secret levels. Modern games could learn a lot from games such as these when it comes to level design. The sounds are just as creepy as I remember them. The success of Doom 2016 shows that these types of games are still very playable with modern graphics. I very much hope that a new singlepayer Quake campaign will happen in very much the same way as it did with Doom. For fast paced twitch shooting and fun levels... you cant get much better than this!			"

												Where Id Software made DOOM into a technological masterpiece in the FPS genre, QUAKE changed the way FPS games will be played forever.  The gothic/hellish fell of the level design, monsters ready to suprise you around every corner and a bodacious arsenal  to rain hell on your enemies. Not to mention (or that I need to), QUAKE was the game that put deathmatch on the map. 1996 was a long ways back, but it still lives up to it's hype and still kick some serious ♥♥♥!I highly recommend it. You haven't lived until you've played it.			"

												I wish there was Steam Workshop support for Quake. With great mods like DarkPlaces + HD texture packs, this game has a lot of life left in it. Steam Workshop would be nice to have. As it is, Quake crashes when loaded through Steam with mods in place, which is a shame because having access to screen caps, and the ingame menu would be nice to have. Otherwise, cannot, not recommend Quake enough. :)			"

												if you suck at tf2 or want to be better at it, here is your steps (a useful advice for the f2p players of tf2)1) get quake on steam and the two mission packs2)intall quake3)get a fan made patches for quake and the mission packs, the next best thing to rocket jumpinghttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=17569234)play singleplayer of quake and get familiar with the mechanics which are very similar to tf2re 4)while playing, play with style that fits you, quake allows you to play anyway you want while progressing through the game5)play multiplayer, and gid gud, and don't forget to have fun while getting good at the game6)after learning most of the important mechanics, apply these skills you aquired from  quake to tf27)???8)profit!and off the record step, don't forget to revisit and play quake again to pay tribute to the timeless classic that shaped games like tf2 and have fun with it again.A side note, this graphics thing, sure it doesn't look as good as the modern day graphics, but it was made in 1997 and the visuals where ground breaking at that time. The visuals still looks authentic to me and original, you can get the fancy texture mod for quake but it wouldn't feel as authentic as classic visuals of quake. For me, the graphics are made for the first impression (to see the beauty of how many colourful pixels there are on the screen), but its the asthetic, the gameplay, and the little stuff that don't include the graphics, which makes the game like quake memorable that you can just revisit and appresiate what its going for compared modern shooters. But I digress, the quake visuals are still appealing to this day. It is still great that you can run this on the modern rigs on any os flawlessly which blew my mind and that is awesome (and this game runs great, no fps drops, the fan patches makes the game alot more enjoyable and the steam version is crap). I love quake, and will revisit it again when I feel like in a quake mood.""Shake it baby, SHAKE! But I ain't gonna quake"" - serious sam			"

												Quake is undeniable. If you're on this store page, you shouldn't need me to tell you how great Quake is, but I am here to assure you that, with a few little patches, you can still play the Quake of your memories.The Steam version, like most digital copies, doesn't include the soundtrack, and GabeN obviously doesn't much care for physical media, so there's not much chance of him sending you a CD. Don't dismay, though. There are all kinds of guides to get the soundtrack up and running, and what a difference it makes! The memories of countless hours spent fragging came flooding back. A few graphical tweaks, and the game actually looks as good as I thought it did the first time I saw it played.If you ever enjoyed Quake, or if you're some kind of child or mutant who's never played before, you owe it to yourself to drop the paltry sum, and experience this masterpiece of foundational game design (foundational to its genre, at any rate) again, or for the first time.

												I absolutely loved this game, this game is so good I'm not sure why a remake hasn't been made yet. It mixes gothic horror (think Edgar Allen Poe and H.P. Lovecraft), freakishly monstrous monsters (Zombies with chainsaws bro {need I say more}), and the awesomeness of first person gameplay. Add in a soundtrack done by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and you've got yourself one scary but awesome game. One of the easiest bosses to defeat too but I'll let you guess witch one. At any rate if you took the time out of your busy day to read this review cool beans, but those but Ranger won't get through those gothic levels themselves...			"

												I was going to leave this review for later when I had more hours in but now seemed like a good time. First, Its a great game. The level design is one of the best I've seen and when ever I go back to levels before I always find something new. To newer gamers in the fps genre might find it difficult though. I would be lying if I said I knew where I was going 100 percent of the time. No I grew up playing Call of Duty 3 and Medal of Honor Frontline. Games that show you A to B in the simplest way possible. Quake is such a breath of fresh air, from the ""modern military shooter,"" I wish I could easly hook on to a server but that won't happen anytime soon. In the end its a timeless classic that will stand the test of time for the next generation of gamers.(hopefully it will stillbe played in the future).			"

												What's there to say about Quake? One of the most world-renowned and memorable FPS' of all time. But why is that the case? Let's take a detailed look and see:1. Gameplay - Let's trim the fat and get right to the guts right off the bat; Quake's gameplay is that of your typical 90's old-school FPS: Fast, bloody, complex and hard as hell, and you will love it (if you're into FPS games, that is). You get a wide array of weapons from a harmless Axe to the dreaded Thunderbolt, which turns any enemy into mincemeat in seconds, including the dreaded Shambler. Also like any old-school FPS, it is rife with secret areas that are a chore to find, but well worth the rewards within! Most times, at least. Tons of pick ups like the Pentagram of Protection (Invulnerability), Ring of Shadows (Invisibility), and the all-too-memorable Quad Damage, allowing you to unleash doomsday to every enemy in sight -- and yourself, too, if you aren't careful! -- dealing a massive 400% damage with any weapon you choose! There is a wide variety of enemies you will also encounter, from the annoying Grunt to the creepy Vore. Hint: When you see a Fiend (the bipedal, ape-like thing with lacerator arms) run like hell. One leap attack, and you're near dead. No joke.2. Graphics - Usually graphics aren't one thing to take too seriously in reviews. In my philosophy, so long as you can see where you are going, and nothing looks TOO pixelated, they're perfectly tolerable. Buuuuuuuuut, that being said, download the Ultimate Quake Patch to be able to play this game in buttery-smooth 1920x1080 (if you have a full HD monitor that is). Never before has a game from the 90's looked so crisp and clear. And to think at one point I thought the 320x240 resolution of Quake on the N64 was the best thing ever. *shudders*3. Difficulty - Hoo, boy...if you are brave enough to play this game on Nightmare (which you should to get the full experience, as cliche as that may sound, I know), this game will keep you on the edge of your seat nearly at all times, especially once you start encountering the bigger, badder enemies in later levels. Also, beware the Spawns (the bouncy slime-things). Just...just trust me on this.4. Replay value - I could start this beauty up and play it any day of the week and have fun with it. It's fast-paced, bloody FPS action at its finest, and one of the true granddaddies of the FPS genre, along with Doom, Wolfenstein 3D and Duke Nukem 3D.Bottom Line: You want this game. It's usually like, $3 or something. Absolute steal and a half. As are the expansions! But I'll review those by themselves.			"

Blowing zombies and orwellion horrors to bits with rocket launchers and nail guns. Parents and me would get into competitions of seeing how fast we could get the game completed. Some of the best memories of growing up go back to this game.Quake will always be there when I need to cheer myself up or need to wind down after a day of work.10 / 10 would play again and again			"

Starting the game off with a single shotgun trying to reach the exit old school style. Plus the game has 4 chapters in the campaign so this game will take several hours to beat by its self alone. If your a person from the 90's who likes classic shooters I highly suggest this game. Just don't kill your self with the rocket launcher.			"

												OK this time this one is for the STEAM AWARDS.I played Quake 1 in 2002 for the first time, and it's still a great first person shooter in all time.Quake is fast, wild, speedy, furious, goreness, bloody, dark, crazy, incrediblely fun. And Quake requires raw skills to beat. It's one of the kings of the thrones of the early 3D FPSes among with Unreal which make your dizzy, vomitting, adrenined. It makes the weak want to quit the PvP electronical sports until years later they can play Counter Strike or Call of Duty. It makes your little sister and brother admire you more. It makes your future son never dare to challenge your FPS domination. It makes your parents hate video games brainlessly. It makes your schoolmates stun and your old Pentium II 450MHz processor with Voodoo 2 graphics card burning besides the crying of your Microsoft mice. It makes you a special person who has the balls to tell the differences of different monitors which support 120Hz or 144Hz refresh rate between 60, 90, 120, 180 framerates. It make you seem like to be a insider of Ang Lee's Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk at its best of 4K resolution with 120fps. And after all, it makes you never be afraid of any 3D sickness and years later laughing and having fun in Virtual Reality while the others can only play just minutes.If human race will vanish, and there is only one FPS game can be saved. I will recommend Quake along with the sound tracks made by Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails.I don't play much Quake on Steam, mostly on an old copy I get from retail with GLQuake executables. New community mods make old Quake so fresh and shinny that almost a modern game with incredible lightening and shadow effects. Still a bad-♥♥♥.I would recommend Quake to anyone who's interested in first person shooter.			"

												Well. If you dont know about Quake your either 3 years old or a complete gaming virgin. And even then i would be surprised. Quake is to 3d shooters what Black Sabbath is to Heavy Metal (which should be listened to loudly while playing). From ID after the iconnic Doom games Quake is the first shooter to go properly three dimensional and pioneered the keyboard and mouse style controls of basicly all shooters made to date.Incredibly emersive even to this day especially played in the graphics excellerated mode ""GL"". As well as fantasicly terrifying sound this game will get your heart rate pumpingIn my humble opinion Quake was home to some of THE most hardcore online gamers in history. If you are a fan of the modern day shooter and are young enough not to of played Quake, pay hommage to all that you enjoy by diving head first into the world of Quake.(Take your time to set up the controls properly, a small hint, open the console with ` and type +mlook to activate freelook)			"

 Overview One of the oldest FPS' out there. Even to this day, the pixelated display (Which can be sorted with a retextured version named 'Quake Epsilon'), retro music, run and gun themes and level design still retain at least some of their widespread popularity. Definitely not for hipster gamers, who play their stupid little 2d pixel 'art' games, this is for real gamers who need a little trip down memory lane.  System Quake runs as it should, anything that causes too much trouble rarely occurs. The controls aren't too hard to master, plus they aren't buggy (As I've found with some other olden games). The controls aren't dissimilar from most modern-day games, with the exception of specialised buttons like turn left 5 degrees or something. It's just point and shoot. No need to reload. Multiplayer The one thing that doesn't really work well in the original Quake is the co-op/multiplayer. It is usually pretty buggy and laggy, and controls have been known to break and/or unbind in a match. Plus, the multiplayer mechanics don't really gel with each other. Sometimes, the AI will just completely break down and enemies will just stare in the direction the editors placed them in and won't attack or move. This also means entities with any properties won't activate or do anything. The single player campaign is good enough on its own, however. Conclusion This game is very good, considering the times it was made in. Newer versions have been released (The aforementioned Quake Epsilon) that make it easier to see what's actually happening. For such an old game, Quake still remains impressive and a fun experience. It may be like Destiny story-wise (It has none), but it certainly makes for a fun pick-up-and-play game when you're bored. 8/10.Alright, we're done here.			"

												What can I say that hasn't been said already? It's Quake, one of the key games in FPS history, and still one of the best if you ask me. My only gripe is that the soundtrack isn't included in the Steam version, but this is easily fixable. Very great game.			"

												One of the best old school FPS games you can find out there.Fight against mind controlled grunts, evil hell knights and eldritch horrors as you fight to save Earth from being taken over by a supernatural force from beyond.You will be amassing a lethal arsenal of weapons including a double-barreled shotgun, nailgun, the classic rocket launcher and much more as you fight your way through slipgate facilities, old monestaries and castles as well as caves where your foes lie in wait to send you to an early death.Do you have the guts to descend into the dark depths and confront the source of the invading forces and put an end to this before it is too late?

												Being, as it is, the last game before John Romero's ill-fated departure from the legendary id Software, this is as much a piece of gaming history as it is a game.don't be fooled by that description, this is one hell of a game, while its graphics and gameplay are dated now, there is still that visceral thrill similar to DOOM that is timeless. sure, newer and arguably better games have been and gone since the mid-1990s, there is still something compelling about Quake, something that hasn't really been captured since Timesplitters: Future Perfect. while the steam version isn't perfect (it's lacking the music from the cd version, something that can be rectified with mods), it is still a visceral thrill to play, and in a first for id software, you start with the shotgun, meaning the awesome starts right at the beginning.the fast-paced action present in this game that, may i remind you, is nearly 20 years old will keep you coming back for decades to come. it is as timeless as super mario bros.

												Unfortunately, this game does not run properly on modern PCs through Steam so you'll probably end up having to download a third-party program that can run Quake on current systems. That being said, if you feel like that isn't too much of a hassle and enjoy shooters that contain hours of countless fun, Quake may be the game for you. There are some really cool mods that exist as well which enhance graphics/sound/etc. and add a replay factor to the game.

												I just installed it today - I played the game waaay back when it was FIRST released(my current phone is more powerful than my first PC!) - and it runs just fine on our run-of-the-mill Windows 10 all-in-one desktop machine.  I did bump up the resolution from its default to something abit more modern, and it takes abit of getting used to(again) the fact that the mouse-looking is just side-to-side, but it doesn't matter at all, though there are keyboard keys for looking up-down. ***This game still holds up today, 20 years after its release.  You will quickly realize how much hand-holding is built into today's games!  Quake is THE game that made me a PC gamer.***It has been brought to my attention that there are various mods available that address certain 'quirks' of Quake that may make the game more enjoyable/accessible to modern gamers.

												I've played all of id's classic FPS games, Wolfenstein 3d and both Dooms. Hell, I even passed Rage and liked it. But quake always flew from my radar. After some research I decided that I liked more the whole sci fi/medieval setting of the first one than the pure sci fi alien shooter of the second and fourth game. Quake has a moody and horrorfying atmosphere to it and solid FPS action. Highly recommend.			"

												FPS for manly man. There was a time when health didn't regenerate, there were no checkpoints and enemies were plenty. If you're up to the challenge, try Quake. This 1996 classic is great fun, just remember to ""upgrade"" your engine, the one provided by Steam is the outdated WinQuake and it's GL counterpart...

												Well what can I say about Quake? Well just that this game oozes nostalgie and it is still as thrilling as it was when I first played this game well over 20 years ago. Even though the graphics are old and objects aren't defined it still has the feeling of suspense and antipication it gave me originally. If you were born in the mid-90's and want a kickback to how games were when you grew up then I would definitely recommend it. However even if you weren't and you want to see how games used to be and you go in with an open mind it could be one of the best games you ever play.			"

												This is what started the Quake series. Its one of the great classics and a must play for any first person shooter fan. I have totally loved playing this game over and over. When I was little this game was so scary. It is not for children, because it might give them nightmares. The graphics are perfect for this game and are totally old school. The gameplay is awesome and has that classic game feel to it. The monsters can be intense at times but with the right weapon you can defeat any of them.The sounds in the game can be creepy at times. The mutiplayer is alot of fun with friends who really enjoy a game like this. The guns are creative and really open up your mind. The bosses aren't hard all the time unless you put the game to its hardest difficulty. The levels aren't hard and really keep you satisfied. I highly recommend getting this game if you want to have a shooter from the past that never gets old.			"

												For this Steam edition, be aware that you don't get any music at all in Quake. Apparently there is a work around, but when one purchases a game they should get the full content.  Otherwise, all seems to be well in the delivery of the game.Quake itself wasn't quite all the gaming public had hoped for back in the mid 90s.   The music, visual design and action seemed quite dull compared to the hell-ride that was Doom, whilst the ""full 3D levels"" didn't seem to impress as much with competition from console games such as Super Mario 64 and Tomb Raider - which both offered smooth character animations where Quake's creatures-from-the-abyss were very jerky...That said, this game still manages to be a mile stone in gaming history.  Its multiplayer culture was massive back in the day and for years to come, and somehow, there is a gritty and creepy menace to the games characters - the jerky animation is actually a strength in this regard.  While Doom was Id's finest hour, Quake is still a highlight for the Texas-based developer.  Go grab a horror/action soundtrack CD from an old film and set it running before loading up Quake, and you'll be pleasantly surprised how delightfully nasty this classic game can be...Oh, for those wondering how to look around with the mouse; open the console and type ""+mlook"" and press enter.

You only need the pak files from the Steam game, then add them to the Quakegasm engine with the VR modifications. Then run Quakegasm and voila! You're teleported to the freakish world of Quake.

												Quake is one of those games that, despite its flaws, has stood the test of time like few others. id made an incredible job of using their limitations to their advantage. The combat is much more close quarters than his cousin Doom due to polycount restrictions, resulting in a much more oppresive experience and tactical interplay between enemy and level design that keeps the game varied without any need for character progression. The monochrome palette flourishes in its lower Middle Age / Lovecraftian setting, evoking a sense of gloom and pestilence that never allows you to be comfortable in any place. Even the dated visuals add to a sense of charm.PROS: A precious blend of atmosphere and fast-paced combat and pure unadulterated fun, stuffed with secrets and power-ups in the best 1990s game tradition.CONS: The mouse controls are the part that has stood worst the test of time, and would really benefit from a revamp (can be modded though). If you can't use 3D acceleration, the highest resolutions run the game at truly unplayable framerates.8/10Buy it whether you played in its day or not, for a timeless piece of History.If one game needs a Doom-like reboot by id Software, is this one.

												This was one of the earlier First-Person Shooters I played growing up. It's a decent game, but shows its age in its gameplay.PROS+Mechanically sound. Gunplay works accurately, and is one of the first FPS games where being able to look up and down is more than useful: it's necessary.+Wide variety of difficult enemies to kill, from lethal Ogres to tanky Death Knights to Zombies that just won't stay down.+Among the first games to incorperate jumping and swimming well.+Instead of being openly demonic, game takes more of a gothic approach with only one monster that's clearly a demon instead of a monster.+Greatly atmospheric, with cold, dark, and slimy level designs.+Added some mechanics which have become a staple of arcade FPS games ever since (such as rocket jumping, bunny hopping, and changing the direction of your jump midair).+Paved the way for many mods which would turn into their own games (such as Team Fortress)+Includes support for OpenGL which really helps the graphical quality.CONS:-Weapons work differently, which is initially confusing. Shotguns are similar to Doom or Duke Nukem, with an instant hit/miss with each pull of the trigger. Machineguns (called Nail Guns in game) fire slow-moving projectiles, which require more leadtime to be useful.-Some levels are confusing and frustrating to advance in.-Console commands necesary to enable mouse look every time you load the game, something which (I would think) be able to switch on and leave on.It's fine, and I had fun playing it, but be aware that it's very much a product of the times, and it shows in more ways than the graphics.

												Ah, Quake...how much we, the gamers of the 21st century owe thee So much of the technology and so many of the conventions we now take for granted were developed for this game. So many great games were built within the Quake engine or its immediate derivatives. It is truly a landmark of gaming history. Some of the greatest geniusus of game development history invested their talents into this game and changed the industry forever.But that's not why you should buy Quake. You should buy this game because it is still one of the best shooters ever made. It's stilll scary and exciting in equal measure. Its design is still darkly original, it's arsenal still finely balanced, and its gameplay still wickely slick.Once you are done with the ~9 hour campaign, why not check out the multiplayer that remains active more than twenty years after the game's release (if that's not proof enough of Quake's superiority, then nothing is). Or perhaps you could head over to Quaddicted.com and try any one of the 1200 user-made single player maps and map packs.For two decades Quake has been an unexhaustable source of pleasure for gamers and I full expect to still be basking in its glory twenty years hence.

												This was one of the earlier First-Person Shooters I played growing up. It's a decent game, but shows its age in its gameplay.PROS+Mechanically sound. Gunplay works accurately, and is one of the first FPS games where being able to look up and down is more than useful: it's necessary.+Wide variety of difficult enemies to kill, from lethal Ogres to tanky Death Knights to Zombies that just won't stay down.+Among the first games to incorperate jumping and swimming well.+Instead of being openly demonic, game takes more of a gothic approach with only one monster that's clearly a demon instead of a monster.+Greatly atmospheric, with cold, dark, and slimy level designs.+Added some mechanics which have become a staple of arcade FPS games ever since (such as rocket jumping, bunny hopping, and changing the direction of your jump midair).+Paved the way for many mods which would turn into their own games (such as Team Fortress)+Includes support for OpenGL which really helps the graphical quality.CONS:-Weapons work differently, which is initially confusing. Shotguns are similar to Doom or Duke Nukem, with an instant hit/miss with each pull of the trigger. Machineguns (called Nail Guns in game) fire slow-moving projectiles, which require more leadtime to be useful.-Some levels are confusing and frustrating to advance in.-Console commands necesary to enable mouse look every time you load the game, something which (I would think) be able to switch on and leave on.It's fine, and I had fun playing it, but be aware that it's very much a product of the times, and it shows in more ways than the graphics.

												I just installed it today - I played the game waaay back when it was FIRST released(my current phone is more powerful than my first PC!) - and it runs just fine on our run-of-the-mill Windows 10 all-in-one desktop machine.  I did bump up the resolution from its default to something abit more modern, and it takes abit of getting used to(again) the fact that the mouse-looking is just side-to-side, but it doesn't matter at all, though there are keyboard keys for looking up-down. ***This game still holds up today, 20 years after its release.  You will quickly realize how much hand-holding is built into today's games!  Quake is THE game that made me a PC gamer.***It has been brought to my attention that there are various mods available that address certain 'quirks' of Quake that may make the game more enjoyable/accessible to modern gamers.

												I've played all of id's classic FPS games, Wolfenstein 3d and both Dooms. Hell, I even passed Rage and liked it. But quake always flew from my radar. After some research I decided that I liked more the whole sci fi/medieval setting of the first one than the pure sci fi alien shooter of the second and fourth game. Quake has a moody and horrorfying atmosphere to it and solid FPS action. Highly recommend.			"

												While modern iterations of the Quake franchise continue to attract new players, there has recently been a clear recognition of the true importance of the very first Quake in shaping the multiplayer FPS games we play today. Clients such as ezQuake, nQuake, and FuhQuake all continue to prolong the multiplayer life of this true classic as well as adding the various options, toolsets, and graphical improvements that most are familiar with today. From Dennis 'Thresh' Fong winning John Carmack's Ferrari 328 at the 1997 Red Annihilation Tournament to the current Quake Live MLG, CPL, Intel Masters, Tek9, and QuakeCon events (to mention just a few), there has rarely been a lapse in the competitive interest this game continues to generate.It is now 20 years since the game's release and there are simply too many happy memories to recount. Without a doubt one of the greatest games ever made and an essential title in any game collection.			"

												Doom for its time was an extreamly great game and still widely played today, in my opinion Quake shares that throne, the throne made of pure gold and big enough to seat 3 important FPS franchises by one developer, and WAY too heavy to be stolen even if every single other franchise tried at once with a heavy duty constuction crane (you know those big ones they use to build big apartment buildings?).The third important FPS is wolfenstine, but that is for another review.In quake you play as a person whos name I have forgoten (if he even has a name, i don't know a lot about the lore) andhave to go through 4 episodes of ancient castles and fortresses in order to collect 4 ancient runes needed to banish a horible evil entity known as shub-niggurath a huge monster and the only way to defeat it, is telefraging it.Not only was quake one of the first TRUE 3D FPS's it's also the start of the team fortress franchise, that's right you know the original rocket launcher for the solider? it's actually the rocket launcher from this very game.When starting it's pretty unique i'm not going to spoile it but, you might like it.The enemies are distinct from each other you got the knights who rush you with a sword, you got the flying monster (whos name i forgot) and then you got the ogre (no not shrek) who can just ♥♥♥♥ off and the blob monster in the last episode can get double f**ked on a pile of spikes because it hops around so damn fast you can barly hit it, these are all enemies you love to hate.anyway i'm not going to waste anymore of your time play this game or look for other reviews on steam or on youtube.

												NOTE: If the game doesn't have mouse look enabled, press ` and type +mlook , then hit enter. If you want the no-look experience bear in mind there are some enemies and switches that you can't hit without it.THOUGHTS:If you want the old school experience, the best way to get it is buy playing something that is from the time, and this is one of the best examples. To give you an idea, difficulty and missions are not selected in a menu, instead when you first play (and between chapters) you enter a small hubworld where you enter portals and tunnels to chose diffuculty and missions. There are even dangers and secrets in the hubworld as well! The highest nightmare difficulty is hidden in the hubworld as well, and I'm not sure if you can get to it without using console commands (someone tell me if there isn't)Just buy it tbh.			"

												Quake is, in my opinion, far more revolutionary to the FPS genre than DOOM.Quake pioneered: Mouselook/WASD Swimming Rocketjumping/bunnyhopping Polygon models Level design via enemy archtypes and placement relative to 3D gemometry MachinimaSadly, steam's digital download doesn't feature the soundtrack. Just open up the track per level via youtube.It's also a shame that we haven't had a proper sequal in over 20 years (if you don't fight entities straight out of Lovecraft with a bloody battleaxe, shotguns, nailguns and explosives in medieval settings, it's not canon).If you remotely consider yourself a fan of the FPS genre, buy this game, it's your history.
