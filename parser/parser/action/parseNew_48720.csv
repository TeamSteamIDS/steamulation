												My god, This game. I cant belive that i missed it when it was released, this game is just pure greatness. I think this is the best ""mount and blade"" game in the series. Its kinda similar to the last game , ""Mount and blade : warband"", but new additions are improved graphics and guns. Gunplay really makes this game unique as the combat in this game is best i have seen in a while. You fire your inaccurate musket or bow from range, and on close combat you try to kill your enemies with a sword, and block enemys attacks, if you master the timing, you can easily take down large group of enemies. It adds bit of reality and cool skill ceiling to the game.In singleplayer, you start as a little poor villager, you can Travel around the map, Take quests , trade ,rob caravans, besiege castles , recruit men and much more. When you start to Get some money and experience , you will start to Get better gear and armor, and you start expanding your army. You can ally with factions and conquer the other factions. Its awesome when at start you rob small bandit groups with your Little army of mens recruited from villages, and after some time, you have army of 100 of mens, and you Attack an enemy faction castle along with your Friendly Armies. Singleplayer is like big sandbox, you can just be trader and make loads of profits, you can be bandit and rob caravans, you can create your own faction and conquer lands, or ally with other factions and eliminate others. You can get hours and hours and hours of fun.    This game also has really entertaining multiplayer, first you create the way your multiplayer character looks like, then you hop in the battle. Usually there are about 50 players in same match, other team is defending castle and other is attacking it. You can buy equiment like better armor with gold (you get more gold when you get kills). There are also classic deathmatch , battle and other game modes. I just love the multiplayer, it feels amazing when musketeers fire their muskets and throw their grenades and trough the smoke charges cavalry trying to stab poor foot soldiers and as the armies meet begins hectic sword play.     Also, this game has really active mod community which helps this game survive on the long runI Cant recommend this game enough , it really is worth the price			"

												What can I say about this game?UPDATE!!!!: While the gameplay itself is absolutely phenominal, there is a MAJOR drawback that I discovered once I was finally given a castle to oversee. Beyond the challenge of getting your best friend, the King, to give you a little slice to call your own, when the budget screen shows up for each town/castle/village you own, instead of putting every tariff and expense on a single sheet with a breakdown of each category as was done in basic Warband, here they point out to you EACH AND EVERY thing you have had built, and every person you have had hired for EACH AND EVERY town, castle, and village. As I mentioned in my first review, there are a lot of options for each location you own. Now imagine every week in game, you are bombarded by a 30 page dissertation of every individual expansion you have ordered. It makes the game *almost* unplayable. This is the only major drawback of the game that I have found. If you can cope with this first paragraph, read on and see why I would still reccommend keeping a dictionary handy to check your sperling and that you should purchase Mount and Blade with Fire and Sword!It's fan-freaking-tastic!!I loved the original, but lets face it, there comes a point when there is no more challenge or suprise to obliterating your opponents on the field of battle. That game was drying up for me, it was finished.Then this little gem appeared, and the love was reborn!The game is the same concept; pick a faction, crush the opposition.What makes this game so great? They give you freaking muskets, pistols, and grenades!The reload spead is faster than reality, but who wants to stand around reloading all the time?But the powder weapons, even at their worst stats are devastating. The grenades are a lot of fun, but leave a bit to be desired. You can choose from three different sizes: Small medium and large. (Sounds like a freaking fast food menu, right?) The problem with each of them is they do not replenish after each battle as bullets and arrows do. But hey, they're already OP, so theres gotta be a drawback somewhere, right? Now here's where I have an issue with the game: Some unknown set of circumstances casues them to explode but do no damage. (Believe me, Im not missing. When you are taking the walls and you are the first one up, get to the top of the ladder and look down at the horde waiting for you [units set at 150]. You cant miss a target like that if you tried. So after the first two grenades, the rest seem to stop working.) But with any of the three types of grenades, you can expect 3-4 kills with one throw. Oh! There is nothing more satisfying than watching a surge of blood-thirsty warriors coming at you with every ounce of confidence that you are going to be splattered across the walls. Then with a single throw, 7 of them just drop dead. And the rest? Well, there seems to be a large impact on morale with these explosions. Sometimes you dont even have to hit anyone. They hear these beasts go off nearby, and that's all for them! FT! Im done!!Another drawback to this game: They took out a lot of the weapons you could get in the original. My favorite was the heavy axe (Or something it was a one-hamded axe, dealing 40c) and they also took out the lucern (Fudge spealling, the pole-hammer) both gone. Replaced now by generic fencing swords and eastern equivalents. The game is still entirely playable, but you just yearn for your tried and true steel buddies of old. Other features of note: You can upgrade and armor recruits at mercenary camps. Each camp has their own nationality and their upgrades only affect that nationality. (Rascist, I know) In cities and Castles/fortresses: You can visit Weapon, Armor, and Horse masters to order ""custom"" associated gear. There is also a WONDERFUL new adition of the Merchant Guild!! Leave a couple thousand Thaler (money) at the ""bank"" and let it accrue interest. Theres even more to mention, but if you even managed to get this far in my review, I salute you! If you liked Warband, just stop reading and get Fire and Sword already! You wont regret it!			"

												Mount and Blade is the secret handshake between PC gamers in the know. It's the last revelation of a secret society. Everything that makes PC gaming great is here. Unique gameplay that would never sell on a console, History nerd heaven, MODS out the Kaiser, and fun mulitplayer.With Fire and Sword is also an amazing entry in the series. The new weapon types shake up gameplay in wonderful ways. The setting is unique for players too. If you are not playing any of the Mount and Blade series, you aren't living properly.I would say that With Fire and Sword may not be the perfect introduction to the series for a new player. Warband, then Napoleonic Wars will acclimate you to this game.			"

												When Mount & Blade came out, it was an ambitious project that did not reach its full potential. The first standalone expansion  (Warband) added some key improvements to the formula, but ultimately it felt like a re-release of the first game with just short of enough new content to justify paying full price for it if you already owned Mount & Blade. With Fire & Sword is the breath of... semi-fresh air that the series needed. The essentials of the gameplay remain almost identical (except for the great addition of powerful firearms and some other additions, which force the player to come up with new tactics). However, it is the setting of this game that really sets it apart from the two previous M&B titles.Based on Henryk Sienkiewicz's historical novel ""Ogniem i mieczem"", the game pushes us back to a period in real world history instead of fiction. We are taken to mid-17th century Eastern Europe, where the once great Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is facing war with multiple of its neighbouring nations. This is where the facts end, as the player can choose to ally himself/herself with any of the real factions included in the game (the 'Polish Commonwealth', the 'Kingdom of Sweden', the 'Cossack Hetmanate', the 'Muscovite Tsardom' or the 'Crimean Khanate') and alter the course of history. Alternatively, like in Warband, you may choose to form your own kingdom or simply remain neutral throughout the duration of the game.Ultimately, the gameplay of With Fire & Sword is refined to such an extent that it feels like the most well-designed of the first three M&B titles. However, it is still very similar to the previous games and suffers from the same main flaws at the core: lack of significant unique content in terms of story. The cold and calculated nature of the tasks and actions the player is permitted to do in the game may get tedious after a while of playing. If you didn't enjoy M&B, then perhaps you should skip this one unless you really like history. On the other hand, if you enjoyed Mount & Blade then I see no reason why you shouldn't like this game (its unique and unusual setting, which explores a period in history rarely ever mentioned in video games, makes this experience more interesting).

												Singleplayer Grade 7/10 (mainly due to bugs)Multiplayer Grade 8/10 (If you buy this game for multiplayer, remember to check if there are still active players online playing this game)IMPORTANT:1) TRY FREE DEMO BEFORE PURCHASING!2) Mount & Blade Warband is much better and it has mods that bring firearms to the game.Short review: Like mount & blade Warband, but in different setting. If you hate idea of firearms in this kind of game you shouldn't buy this game. The grade is lower than in Warband, due to some problems in gameplay and large amount of gamebraking bugs.Full review:The singleplayer of this game gives you the possibility to lead mercenary warband in the setting of 17th century eastern europe. Like in mount and Blade warband, the experience is generally exciting and unique. Unlike Mount & blade Warband, which is like huge sandbox, this game tries to create what many consider the the Holy Grail of gaming , which is combining story and sandbox gameplay. Unfortunately the developers failed in this in many ways.First problem is that many players didn't care at all about the story and wanted to play sandbox game, but this was difficult due to the fact that unlike in Warband, you can't create your own kingdom. You can't get married either and there are no tournaments. Because of these and some other reasosn he RPG and sandbox elements are lacking compared to Warband.Second problem is that if you follow the story (I played the Black Mace campaign which on my opinion unfortunately wasn't interesting) you will face problems. The first one of those are huge amount of bugs, that force you to load your saved game many times during the campaing. Many of these bugs are related to the fact that the world of the game changes usually independently comapred to the story. Even when these changes don't cause actual bugs, they can seriously hamper the players attempst to progress in the story. I was for example given task to capture certain city from hostile country Poland, but by the time I had army to capture it, neutral country Crimean Kahanate had already taken it. In order to capture the town, my country would have to start war also against them. This would have been almost certain defeat due to getting into war in two fronts.Third problem is the setting. Some people might be scared about the strange setting, but that is not what is the main problem. The problem that the setting causes is that it affects the gameplay negatively. In mount & Blade Warband, the player can both be commander of his/her troops and also be the superhero in shining armour that kills dozens of enemies on his/her own. This is even somewhat historical because armour made medieval knights very difficult to kill. In Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword, half of those filthy peasants :-) that you used to kill without trouble are now armed with firearms, that kill you with one or two shots on hardest difficulty. Even on lower difficulty levels it is difficult to be superhero anymore. The one shot kill firearms also make melee weapons relatively weak, which is a shame, because one of the best things in Mount & Blade series is the melee combat.Despite the severe problems in singleplayer I gave this game grade of 7, because the basic mechanics of Mount & Blade series are still there and they are great.Multiplayer part is good, mainly due to the uniqueness of Mount & blade combat. The reason to not to give 9/10 for multiplayer is that there are no modifications for multiplayer unlike in Warband, and because the gameplay is slightly worse due to what firearms cause to the gameplay.

												Mount&Blade: With Fire and Sword takes place in the middle of the 17th century, its about evolving your character into either a bandit, lord or even a king. The game has 5 main factions: The Cossack Hetmanate, Polish Commonwealth, Crimean Khanate, the Kingdom of Sweden, and the Muscovite TsardomMount&Blade: With Fire and Sword is just like every other Mount&Blade game, addicting, fun, amazing, any good word that comes up in your head. There ARE bugs, but not much. It doesn't cost much, worth every single cent.My rating: 9.5/10			"

												Tis a good but nuanced game. I could only recommend it to people who really like Mount & Blade and are interested in Polish history. Game has promised patches that never came, the ""Black Mace"" story quest (Ukraine/Zhaparozhie) is still broken IIRC haven't done it recently. The game is also incredibly imbalanced and the firearms are the worst of it. The sad part is that it's not the inclusion of the firearms, but rather their mechanics. You can reload a a full-length rifle while galloping on horseback, I'm not even exaggerating sadly. Like I said good but nuanced game. Only buy if you really like M&B and Polish history.			"

												Aye, over thousand hours have been sunk in Mount & Blade With Fire and Sword.And why I've sunk so many hours in this game, you may ask,The answer is: because I really love the time period of this game and I find it most interesting part of history.But let me tell you what the game is:The game is basically reskin of Warband with muskets with the singleplayer which is a sniper simulator in a nutshell. Nothin' to add that.Multiplayer is: Full of pike-spammers (is that even a real term?) Badmins who ban you without hesitation Musket snipers (other strange term)Horse archers who can snipe you from miles away Stupidly fast infantry (like Crimea and Cossacks) who can almost outrun a horse.I have very negative thoughts of this game and only good thing is the time period of game.If you want a masochist experience then this is the game for you!Edit: review updated with more explanatory content and (hopefully) better grammar.Edit 2: got banned from a siege server because I was better than the admin in combat.

												You know, i dont know how many reviews says get Warband instead. I wanted to begin with With Fire and Sword, and do Warband later.But if you are looking for modding directly. Then go Warband directly.Just make sure first to play With Fire and Sword if you like the time period, atmosphere and nations, if you like those, this can be the best of MB serie for you,with true to life Euro-asian nations and etnicities.    Whole game is very ethno...Interesting and funny wars. Also challenging achievements.. All broken.This game is little buggy. But most bugs can be overcome with enough persistance and patience. Persistance and patience, are key to its gameplay too, as 90% of the game, you will travel as a courier, riding around with foods.If you have patience for all that, you will never give up on this game, you will enjoy it even more. It is a personal preference.11/10			"

Posted: January 6, 2016
												This game is fantastic. I've put hundreds of hours into it, and I'll likely put hundreds of house more into it. Takes place in the real world in mid-17th century Eastern Europe. There's 5 factions; Muscovite Tsardom (Russia), Sweden, Poland, Crimean Khanate (Crimea, which is a location in the game), and the Cossacks. You'll meet people from these areas as well as Spaniards, Frenchmen, Germans, and even Scotsmen. There are muskets, and because of the time period, they come in a variety of flavours. Home made, matchlock, wheel lock, and Miquelet (flintlock) are the main ones, in order of quality. Accuracy is in short supply of course, but I do believe there are some rifled muskets in the game, however they are VERY expensive, and not something you can give normal soldiers. Only your own character, and heroes.You amass your own Army, there are many different endings, and there are many different ways to fight. Personally I like to position my cavalry to the side, while my infantry takes 10 paces in front of my marksmen to defend them from enemy cavalry, while my own cavalry does the same. If the enemy bowmen/musketmen get too close for my liking, I'll send in my infantry to charge them, make them switch from ranged attack to melee, so that my own musketman can help quell them while they're busy with my infantry and cavalry. Works very well for me so far, as you can tell it's all basically revolving around my musketmen, but the infantry and cavalry certainly have their place. Without one or the other, I would feel vulnerable. You can cavalry if you like, or perhaps just stick with infantry and musketmen, or even exchange the musketmen for bowmen but you best have some DAMN strong bowmen with some DAMN strong bows because as troops come with heavier armour, those arrows quickly start doing less and less damage, however muskets will always do a lot of damage... when the shots hit. Thick shields and thick armour combined can really lessen a musket's effectiveness however.There's lots of quests, lots of cities and towns, lots of different methods to take in order to secure victory, the replay value is VERY MUCH present, and as many battles as I take part in, it never seems to get old. The tutorial is entertaining enough, complete with voice acting, but it's not something that drags out annoyingly long. It puts you in the action quite quickly, and then you're free to go, Eastern Europe is yours to explore! Though there are some muskets that are so accurate you'd think them rifled, there's always bullet drop, so you'll have to learn to compensate for that. It just adds to the gameplay however, which though simple, is difficult to master, and I'd have it no other way. Like Call of Pripyat with Misery mod (and The Armed Zone if you REALLY want to be overloaded with firearm selection), and like Red Orchestra II/Rising Storm, I expect to ultimately end up with 1000+ hours in this game as the years go by. Sure it doesn't look particularly pretty, but there's a unique appeal to it that I've yet to find in any other game or mod. An experience in and of itself.The process of leveling up, improving my various aspects, getting better gear, customizing ther Mercenaries available for hire at Mercenary Camps, training them up from Recruit, to Experienced, to Veteran, to Elite... it's so much fun that I've lost count of how many time I've restarted the game. A clean slate starting at day 1, my current playthrough is over 450 days in-game, over a year's worth, my Army is at a max of about 87-88 troops, however when I put the coin down for Mercenaries with ALL the best equipment I can give them, then train them together with a few of my heroes to work them up to Veterans and Elites, my less than 90 soldiers feels more like 150-200 or more, usually depending on how many muskets the enemy is bringing to the battlefield. If none, it feels like I've got 300 troops, might even be gutsy enough to take on 350 if all they have is bowmen, but that might be reaching a bit too far. All the same, there's such a wide range of armour, melee weapons, bows, muskets, horses, troops, and so on... the variety is amazing. Ultimately though, we all know that muskets would come to rule the battlefields in the 18th and early-mid 19th centuries, so although most of the muskets in the game are primitive matchlocks, it can only be expected that they'd ultimately be superior. That said however... armoured, well trained, and well equipped bowmen vs unarmoured, untrained, and ill-equipped musketmen? I'd put my money on the bowmen any day of the week. You don't pick up a musket and you're suddenly invincible. If you see a hussar barreling at you on horseback with lance couched, as of yet untouched on the battlefield, a single musket ball will likely do little more than♥♥♥♥♥♥him off, you'll want a second one to finish the job, but if he gets you with that lance, musket or no, you're equally dead both ways. Some say that cavalry with muskets is all you need, but cavalry can only use carbines of pistols, and not only that, firing on horseback isn't as accurate as firing on the ground, so not only does fool soldiers with muskets have more accurate firearms that cause more damage, they also have the advantage of firing on the ground. However once they have to be forced to use melee, the shooting stops, and if the enemy is still shooting or firing arrows, then you're at a heavy disadvantage, which is where the infantry comes into play. Troops trained in melee combat, often given better melee weaponry, have them positioned to protect your musketmen, just as pikemen had done before the advent of the bayonet. If the fighting becomes stagnant though, with the musketmen a mere 50m away, sending in volley after volley, order the infantry to charge, get up in their faces so they can't keep their muskets spitting, but keep your men firing lead balls into them. Yes, just like chess, there are many ways to attain victory. Find your own way, your own troops, your own tactics, and take 17th century Eastern Europe for your own! HUZZAH!			"

												BUTThe reason I don't recommend this game is because it's predecessor (M&B: Warband) is an absolute gem with essentially the exact same graphics and gameplay but for me it just feels.. better. If you haven't tried it then you should go pickup Warband and if you have played Warband then I'm here to warn you that F&S is just a little bit off.I can't quite put my finger on it; perhaps it's the strategical considerations that come into play with the introduction of firearms, or perhaps it simply wasn't balanced quite as well, but either way F&S on the whole is just not as enjoyable to me as Warband. Both are exceptionally unique and fantastic games but I would either buy Warband if you're new to Mount and Blade or stick with Warband if you're a fan of the series.			"

												I spent 5 years trying to come up with a funny review for this game. I failed. Now, I'm gonna stick with the good ol' boring, wannabe helpful review.I don't have an idea why I didn't reviewed this game for so long but seeing those fresh recruitments (thx to bannerlord I guess), I decided to be helpful to those who consider buying this game as a committed player of the series, started playing Mount and Blade in November 2009 and spent many days&nights playing it since then.Comparison to the previous games; Even tho scenarios to take the throne of some nations (like Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Russia) were added as a unique feature to it's predecessors, Single player was a little... dull. Despite using firearms, siege artillery still wasn't added to the game. There are some features like; ordering a weapon for yourself, changing equipment of the mercenaries from their camps for a price (yeah, they have camps now) etc. but also It didn't have marriage or creating your own kingdom/empire so they took some things out, put some in.Multiplayer on the other hand was quite entertaining, especially clan battles. So just go for it If you want to pvp. Even tho, the era of clans is over, you won't have trouble finding a server if it's not late night or morning. Multiplayer is still not dead! The game isn't demanding and most likely to run smoothly on ancient rigs. (Hello 128 MB Video Card)  Graphics are ok, not great but ok. (Graphics wasn't the MB's strong suit anyways). As for the price, It's cheaper than what it deserves right now.* I give it a 7/10, feels incomplete in so many levels but also doesn't fail to keep you entertained. At the current price, It's worth it.			"

												This is a very nice and a heck of an addictive game! It is very much like Warband, but with a few major differences: firearms - drastically changes the combat; grenades - probably the most fun part of the game; realistic world map and city names - makes it a lot easier for the player to connect to the in-game world. But the most important thing for me is that I can hire an army of my ancestors - the Kalmyks.

												YEs! this game has everything that made Warband great plus early era guns and cannons! i put off playing it for a while, because i was worried the guns would be too overpowered and sometimes they can be. you can be mid to late game and be a super high level with tons of health and armor and get murdered by a couple stray bullets, but it's not something that's going to happen a lot. especially if you play smart. i think this game requires much more strategy than Warband. in warband, by the time i've level 40 or so, i can wade into a battle and kill 20-50 people on my own and it's much harder to do that in this one because of how much damage guns can do. you also tend to have more casualties during battle and numbers tend to matter more. it's like they took all the good parts about warband and added to it. more quests, a new world, new factions, more and different weapons (including primitive grenades). beyond all that, the various factions have their own storylines which i did not need, but kind of love. playing as the polish will have some different quests from the swedish which are different from the russians which is different from the crimeans. the addition of the story elements add some believability to the various relations between the factions because you learn why they like the factions they like and hate the factions they hate.if you played warband and like it, you'll most likely enjoy this game too. if you haven't played warband, i recommend getting the mount and blade full collection and playing warband first, then coming to this, because there are some major differences in gameplay. i assure you the addition of guns and bombs adds much more depth and strategy to this game than warband had to it. that's not to say warband was bad or too easy, just that guns make it easier to kill than swords. which we all already knew anyway.

												TL;DR It's a fun game but Mount and blade warband is better.Let me explain. I bought this game on a sale because guns sound a lot more fun and warband was more expensive. So I bought this and the original mount and blade. The problem with this game is that the single player is hard. Like really hard. It's hard earning money, there is no real tutorial to learn you how to start your own empire or join an existing empire etc.My first time playing my men were starving, I had ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons and I was fighting bandits in hope that I could pay for my soldiers and food. Eventually my luck ran out and I lost everything. This has been a theme for my experience with the singleplayer. It's fun if you know how to play and earn money without going to tournaments and cheating the system like in warband. So why do I have so many hours on it? Well the multiplayer is awesome. Shooting people with muskets and♥♥♥♥♥♥is a ton of fun. It's a bit like the napoleonic dlc for warband, which is a ton of fun, but more derpy. I guess this is where I conclude my review. This game is fun if you know how to play, the multiplayer is the best part and I've played a lot of it however the singleplayer is somewhat lacking and where the previous games were fun this one is too difficult and time consuming. I've put 20 hours or so into the singleplayer but I just don't get into it.			"

UPDATE: As much as I would like to get into this game more its pretty boring compared to Warband. Plus I hate the looks of the clothing and weapons.While Mount and Blade: With Fire & Sword isn't as fun as Warband, it's still pretty awesome. I've read both positive and negative reviews for this game and I can see how it can go either way. I personally enjoy this game, it gives you an entirely new perspective on the world forcing the player to adapt to a new environment very quickly. I find making enemies much easier in With Fire & Sword than it was in Warband, so you need to watch what you do or you could find yourself alone against an army.Mount and Blade: With Fire & Sword is very similar to Warband only in a different era (The 17th Century to be exact). Here's my breakdown of WFaS:PROS+ Includes 21 Steam Achievements (Some more challenging to get than others)+ Requirements are low allowing this game to be played on almost every computer+ All Castles & Fortresses have Taverns (Unlike in Warband it was just the towns)+ Ability to chat with the Mayor/Elders directly from the town menu (Unlike in Warband you had to find them yourself)+ Ability to make a wagon fort (Allows for a better defense perimeter in Battles, but does not necessarily give you an avantage)CONS- No Steam Trading Cards- Larger quantity of Bandits/Looters/Enemies than in WarbandWHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? WITH FIRE AND SWORD! (BUY THIS GAME)My Rating: 9/10 (Recommended) "

												Fantastic and fun game. Not as good as Warband but once you get out of the beginning phase it's a very enjoyable game.... at least until major quest givers disapear from the ♥♥♥♥ing mapI wasted 20 hours on a character. I was nearing the end of the Muscovite questline, at the point where you rebel with the claimant to the Tsar's throne and declare yourself the grandson of Dimitry.So in that quest you have to get support of a certain warlord. Nikita Odeovseky or something. Naturally, the first thing I do is go find the nearest Muscovite warlord to ask where Mr. Nikita is. ""I don't know where Warlord Nikita Ovaryscars is"". Hmm maybe this is something for the quest and i'm supposed to go to the only fortress he lives in. Nope that doesn't seem like it. Maybe I have to wait. So I set up camp for a week. Nothing. Talk to another lord and ask where this jackass is. ""I don't know where he is.""Okay something's ♥♥♥♥y.Save and quit. Enable cheats. Control + T in order to view everything on the map. Can't find this guy's party. He isn't in any Muscovite castle chilling like a ♥♥♥♥♥. Maybe he's prisoner somewhere and I need to break him out! :OI spend 15 minutes scanning this damned map looking at every prisoner garrison of every castle, town, and noble for this warlord. Nope. He's gone.Okay ♥♥♥♥ this save is broken. Maybe I'll restart, export the character, inflate his skills and give him cash, then breeze through back to where I was. K cool.2 hours into going back through the beginning dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥hardass phase of blah blah♥♥♥♥♥kissing nobles and take this letter across the map to this guy who is definitely at this town but by the time you get there he's somewhere else. Great now to initiate the quest I had started. No time wasting now.Gotta find the Tsar.Go ask nearest warlord where Tsar Mikhaelovich is.""I do not know where Tsar Mikhaelovich is""where's a gun			"

It contains dynamic squads you can command that adjust to player count and a whole but load of new content, maps, and server side mods with battles of 300-400+ units cooperatively and up to 30 other players.

Pros:+Firearms+Grenades+Additional siege options (sneak through town, blow up wall, poison water supply)+Campaigns+More town/empire management+Real map locations+Can trade in castles (was not able to in Warband)+Bank/debt system (however simple it might be)+Can place orders on the best equipment from various venders (new feature)Neutral:~New siege system. Multiple ladders instead of one. Good if you are an attacker, bad if you are defender. ~Gameplay. Overpowered bullet damage forces you to keep your distance and player smarter. Cons:-HORRIBLE SIEGE AI. ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS. Half the time your troops or the enemy is just standing there, doing absolutely NOTHING or they keep switching their weapons back and forth, whilst doing nothing. -Bugs. CTD bugs after tabbing out, finishing a battle, or just traversing the map sometimes. 'Line error' messages and more bugs sometimes after battles and quest completions. And then you can also shoot someone and the bullet will go behind and not do any damage. Extremely annoying.-Campaign intructions are vague and hard to figure out. You will end up using google to complete missions. I guarantee it. -Tax revenue from towns is no longer automatic. You have to visit your town to collect.Overall, it is a step down from Warband. Sure, you can say ""but guns, so cool, much wow. pew pew gg"" but these new additions do NOT make up for the sloppy AI and the bugs. The ""RAAHH CHARGE!!!! I'LL KILL 50 OF YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S!!"" feeling at the beginning of every battle is not the same as it is in Warband, there's more of a risk to go in balls deep forcing you to stay back in every battle.TL;DR - Do not buy this game if you are looking to get into the Mount & Blade series, buy Warband instead.. Vanilla (unmodded) Warband offers a similar experience but with less of the hassle. Modded Warbands offers a superior experience, and it has a wide array of mods in comparison.			"

												Its actually challenging! Instead of just spamming rhodoks or nords you actually have to think here. Musketeers are vital to a healthy strong army, but are terrible in combat, infantry is high damage but not very hardy and calvary is EXTREMELY EXSPENSIVE but hold a raw power unseen by any force on earth besides the German Blitzkrieg, but be warned, these arent the Swadian tanks weve come to love, charging a musketeer wall head on is a mistake and you WILL lose men! constantly refresh your reserves. As always make sure to keep your factions kept within your army to one or two as desertion is common. Be warned, you are no longer the god wielding death and mayhem with your heavy armor and two handed weapons as seen in warband, shaking off all but the most powerful blows, in this game you are very, very vulnerable early game and even late game you are still able of being beaten. Armor and weapons are exspensive and money can be hard to come by, COMPLETE FAVORS TO GET MEN. PERIOD. GET DAT TOWN RELATION STAT AS HIGH AS A KITE BECAUSE WITOUT IT YOUR ARMY WILL DWINDLE! AND IF YOU RUN INTO DESERTERS EARLY GAME PAY THEM OFF! THESE ARE NOT THE IDIOTIC NORD AXEMEN THAT YOU CAN RIDE AROUND AND SABRE ONE BY ONE, THESE ARE MEN WITH MUSKETS AND CALVARY OF THEIR OWN THAT CAN AND WILL 1 HIT KILL YOU, YOUR FOLLOWERS, AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR MEN. MY FIRST PLAYTHROUGH I HAD 20 SCYTHE WIELDERS AND RAN INTO 6 WINGED HUSSARS. NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS CAPTURED AND MY ARMY DECIMATED. GREAT GAME			"

												Here's the thing - if you're looking for the best mount & blade to buy and can only afford one of them, this is, sadly, not the choice to make. I love this game but Warband is the superior one, although this one has guns for the campaign, the gameplay is better and warband and there's just not anything new here. I enjoy both of the games, but this game does lack in comparison. Now is it a bad game? Hell no. I love using a two-handed claymore one minute and switching to a pistol for the next wave of enemies, and having a group of 100 men with nearly all of them using muskets is so satisfying when you can watch them shoot down the entire enemy group. If you can afford both mount and blades grab both of them, and while you'll throw more hours into the other, you'll get a great amount of game time and fun from this one as well to make your purchase worth it. Just wait for a sell first.			"

												Pretty similar to Warband, and still good, and the graphics are maybe slightly improved. However, I can't seem to get in to it as much as I do Warband..I would say just play Warband, its better than this one, with♥♥♥♥♥♥tons of mods that can mostly emulate what this game has. I honestly wouldnt buy this game, if you have the money for Warband. If you have the 20$ (or only like 3ish dollars on sale) Buy Warband, It's an excellent game. But this one is still ok, its basically the same concept as Warband except it is set in Eastern Europe and there are guns...It has OP guns in the beginning and the map isnt huge. The armor is weak and the weapons are too...I'm just reccomending this to not hurt the series. It is much more difficult than Warband and honestly not as fun. Just get Warband.			"

												Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword is on of the greatest strategy games (in my humble opinion) of all time. Not only can you command your army, but you can do so while playing as your own character. The multiplayer part of this game is not very famous, by that i mean not many people play it, yet it still gives you a sense of trying to get better and and improve at it to better yourself to someday beat someone who slayed you before. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy games and doesnt mind to learn from mistakes.			"

												okay my review:Maps 5.5/10.0Well you might ask me: why so low score? just because they didnt make castles historically accurate, and just a few unique buildings, while the eastern europe was filled of them. Example: my country's capital Vilna (Lithuanian spelling: Vilnius) had a river getting into two pieces, a very steep hill with a great tower on top and walls surrounding. the tower on hill is even today staying there. you could google it too. Trakai, that village nearby, was no worse, it had huge great fort in a island which was in a huge lake, altho what i've seen was a random village with a few houses ingame. The map could've been more accurate.Combat + Units 8.0/10.0The game, has great combat, altho sometimes AI gets easily stuck or it forgets to fight and other funny buggy things. sometimes they even bug out so hard, but still its good.But the units, you could've make a bigger variety of them, because i am pretty sure there was not a lack of unit kinds there. I like the ones that you made, but some are little inaccurate.Storylines + Quests 7.5/10.0The Quests from cities are a little boring: if you do much of them, they repeat quickly...Storylines are good, but sometimes buggy.Factions 9.5/10Well they're great, but it would've been more amazing if we wouldve had prussia, ottomans, austrians too!Overall calculated rating of these things from me is 7.625/10.000			"

												This is a mod of the original version of Mount & Blade. The primary focus of this mod is the singleplayer campaign revolving around the formation of the Moscovite Tsardom of Russia, the Swedish Deluge into Poland, and the Crimean Khanate Incursion into Kiev; this is the modern day area of Eastern Sweden, Poland, Ukraine, and Western Russia. The big gameplay change is the inclusion of firearms; however since this is based on the original Mount & Blade, the Player will automatically lose the battle if his character is knocked out. With the inclusion of volley fire firearms, the player character can be knocked out with a single bullet, causing the gameplay to suffer greatly. The second large addition to this mod is 3 unique questlines revolving around the kingdoms of Poland, Cossack Ukraine, and Moscovite Russia. However, the questlines are near impossible to complete without a guide, are buggy, and poorly translated.With the singleplayer losing most of its charm with combat being against the player's favor, and the quests being difficult, requiring guides, buggy, AND uninteresting, I cannot recommend this game.The multiplayer is an interesting take, but the Napoleonic Wars mod for Warband handles firearms much better. I recommend M&B: Warband over this game. Free Warband mods are vastly better than this one.			"

												Buy Warband instead. The difficulty between this game and Warband has been increased greatly, which isn't a bad thing. Once you got a hang of Warband the AI got fairly easy. Unfortunately success in this game is not only greatly more difficult, especially at the lower levels, but often your success in matters are not only random, but often the odds of missions you are given are literally impossible.If the only issue was difficulty it'd not be a problem. But mission scaling is horrendously broken. If you take a mission, especially at the lower levels, you have typically less than a fifty percent chance of finishing it. I would say the game is just too difficult, but I've nearly mastered Warband and I can't play this one for more than a few minutes without either losing and getting captured, or save scumming.			"

												Tl&dr: my recommendations for M&B variants are as follows:1. Viking Conquest Reforged2. Floris mod3. Warband4. Any mod you can find, but you can expect some crashes and bugs in some5. With fire and sword6. Blood and Gold: Carribean! (only for a 5 minutes laugh)I assume this M&B version wanted to put the player in a position closer to an army general than the original Warband, but fails to do even that through its own fault. This is why (comparing to Warband):- no more character attributes design at start of the game. You start with the same point in all attributes and can distribute only a few. You will be a poor fighter, poor trader with a slightly above average IQ; no other choice.- since the discovery of fire (a.k.a. muskets) any fight can end abruptly if some mediocre rifleman gets lucky and lands a head shot from across the map, no matter how many hit points you have or what head gear you use; but to be honest, this can be avoided 99.99% of the times if you get a horse and run around in circles like a crazy chicken. In short, if you run around buck naked you survive, if you stand still in the best armor in the game, you die.- although the game almost forces you into a command position, the battle map size doesn't really give you this feeling. Half the times, after you give a few commands and your men start to move into position, the enemy cavalry is already close and charging, turning what should be a clean line-infantry battle into a total mess of men and horses.- adding to the above point is the battle size limiter to 150, which makes you feel like you are the leader of an oversized gang, rather than some wannabe Napoleon. There are tools to increase this size to 1000, but, considering the small maps, having 1000 men fighting is more of a lottery than some tactical or strategic combat.- Warband had a questionable AI at best in siege battles, but this one made the step forward. The best result I had against this terrible AI was at a siege 60 attackers vs. 180 defenders. Attackers won with 1 wounded and 1 dead.- speaking of AI, do not expect any challenges on the global map either. No matter what you do, you can't be outsmarted, the only way to lose anything is through brute force, when you are seriously outnumbered.- story-line quests are bugged; almost all of them. The only one that works without constantly saving because of the fear of the bugs is the Polish one. However, it has some interesting ways to make the game challenging. One moment you have half of the map, the next half of your cities belong to the enemy without any battles fought or any warnings. Why? Because you talked to some guy and asked him what's wrong. Thank you.- no more tournaments, lots of quests from Warband removed- troop upgrade trees are lacking imagination to say the least- money from fiefs are not sent to you automatically forcing you to make a tour every now and then to collect your taxesOverall, a M&B with less interesting combat, but in which you can trade and become a tax collector.

												Props to my good friend RedAlpha for giving me this games as a Christmas gift. Thanks alot, buddy. Fire & Sword, as a standalone expansion to Warband, is almost mechanically identical to it's relative game and has everything from it that makes it good, but there are tweaks and alterations that set it apart from the game enough to justify it as it's own separate title. Not only changing the weapons that the skills constitute and the armor and apparel to go with the new, much more advanced and recent setting than Warband, but to go with that, they added guns and grenades (Hence 'Fire and Sword'.) which is my favorite selling point in this game, because of this, they changed the ranged infantry from Archers to Marksmen, whom you can command to form rows thanks to the new additions to the order-giving system this game has. However, Fire & Sword also shares the two infamous gripes I have with Warband: Frustration with regards to difficulty, and as mentioned in the Warband review, letting a snail win a race to you while you're -riding a horse.- Oh well, just like Warband, this gets a 9/10, an impressive.

												This game is probaly the best sword fighting game I have ever played :D It's amazingly addictive and keeps you entertained for hours...But the thing is, it was originally a DLC so it's not that big a game. But that doesen't mean it's only has 1 level. It has 2 modes: castle seige and battle mode. (+ Campaign mode).In both battle mode and castle siege you only have one life, which immediatly rises the tension.The campaign mode is good and fun, but i prefer the other game modes. The online exprience has some different maps and it is modable (Is that a word)?but the other players.. My god they are annoying.So say you want some good old swordfighting action, yeah? You want them to fully block, and attacklike a proper duel, yes? But the thing is, the other players think that doing that is bullsh*t and spin around in circles while mashing left click is a good way to win a fight. Just saying.Overall Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword is a great game but however has some issuses. (I forgot to mention that the graphics aren't that good, but that doesn't ruin the experience at all).The game has a simple to learn but hard to master combat system. It's very simallar to Chivalry Medival Warfare.In other words, BUY THE GAME!			"

												I'm up in the air with yes and no. It is not as good as Warband, but it's fun. It's got optional story, which is nice, and guns and horses and swords, which are all nice, (oh, and GRENADES!) but it has its fair share of problems. You can't set up your custom kingdom, you can only usurp existing ones. Bad. You can die (yes, that matters a lot!), which is not supposed to happen in M&B, and some of the storylines are just plain silly. Looking at The Deluge and Black Mace! False Dmitri is probably the best one. Speaking of which, this game is considerably more linear than the others, which is why it is out of the loop. Mount&Blade is supposed to be sandbox open-world blah blah. Also, you can't go home and become a family man here. You don't have that option anymore. So, go back to Warband for the moment, and wait until Bannerlord to -see if it is any good-. EDIT: Bannerlord will be the best game of all time. Be a family man.Anyway, returning to this, guns! Why not? The other best part is that if you hire a mercenary army, you can customise their uniforms. 11/10, would make morion-toting Crusader army again.			"

												-Started campaign-Became a trader and made some money-Hired mercanaries and began adventuring in the north-Did a couple quests for the muscovite tsardom-Found an old man in a village who gave me a golden cross and pistol-Decided to not pay attention to what the man said and went to do more quests for the tsardom-Delievered a horse to the tsar-About to be vassalized for bringing a horse to him when he sees the cross-Got thrown in jail-Escaped jail and fled to poland-Found a claiment to the tsardom who decided to help me overthrow the tsardom-Used the cross and claimed i was the real heir to the tsardom to turn the entire army against the tsar-Overthrew the tsar and betrayed the claiment who helped me-Became the new tsar and led the muscovite tsardom to glory.10/10 would overthrow the muscovite tsardom again.Seriously though this game is pretty good, not as good IMO as warband but its up there, wouldnt suggest getting this if you want to just join a kingdom and take over the world as the vassalize system feels slightly broken (Tried to get vassalized once by sweden got the king to 80 opinion of me and had fought so many battles against his enemies yet he wouldnt vassalize me at all) however sieges are pretty fun and there are more options than in warband for sieges such as blowing a hole in a wall. Outside of sieges combat is really fun and requires you to use a strategy instead of just charging all the time like most would in warband, however it does have alot of glitchs from what i can see and IMO is not as well done as warband is however one thing this game has over warband is story quests, three of them infact one for the muscovites, one for the polish, and one for the cossacks, they are pretty fun and enjoyable decent length to. 7/10 great game if you like 1600's combat and want to play a mount and blade game that has a ""main story"" element and don't mind the fact the game feels a little unfinished in some areas			"

												The game's story was so good that it inspired me to read the novel that this game was based on. It also got me interested in 17th century Eastern Europe history, just like how Napoleonic Wars DLC got me interested in 19th century Western Europe history.There are three main storylines (Polish, Cossack and Muscovite) depending on the faction you join. So you could play the game 3 times to get through all the endings.I recommend playing with a mod to enhance the experience.			"

												A good game. Though it isn't as good as Mount and Blade: Warband, it is still awesome in its own way.Pros: Guns - guns are OP. Sure, they take a long time to reload, but they have power and can wipe out whole armies.Actual trading - assessing local prices actually means something and you can make lots of money by doing it. Also, you get to form your own caravans, which is awsome and makes you very rich if you do it right.Banks and Guilds -you get to deposit money in banks and gain interest on that. You can also take loans as well. There are special guilds which can sell you special armor and weapons. Though expensive, they are very cool and can provide you with some cool stuff.Useful Castles - sounds weird, I know, but now every fortress or castle has a tavern and a marketplace. Unlike the Warband castles, which were basically just strongholds, the WF&S castles allow you to sell stuff, access the tavern, and talk to a mayor for quests. Interesting story-based quests  - there are special series of story-based quests for the Poles, the Russians, and the Cossacks. These stories are well-done and are quite interesting, giving you some history lessons while at the same time letting you campaign and battle Mount and Blade style.Grenades  - sure, they're almost always inefficient and usually not worth the steep price, but they are freaking GRENADES. IN MOUNT AND BLADE!!!!Cons - Bugs and Glitches - the developers moved on before the game was fully fixed, which is a huge shame. Though the game is mostly smooth and most problems have been dealt with, you may experience some graphical glitches here and there. At the worst, you will have a bug that wiill ruin your game. For example, a faction leader will be defeated in battle and never reappear, or the story-based quests will break and you'll be forever stuck on one part. Hopefully, you won't have these, but you've been warned.Lack of variety - in Warband, all the factions were truly unique, with obvious strengths and weaknesses. In WF&S, all the factions seem the same. Aside from appearances and some strengths (Poles= cavalry. Swedes = infantry), the factions don't have enough variety to make they feel truly unique in battle. At the end of the day, they are all essentially the same.No Story for Crimeans and Swedes - while the Russians, Poles, and Cossacks have story-based quests, the Crimeans and Swedes have none, which is a shameMap is Bland - in Warband, you have a desert, a steppe, a tundra, a mountain range, and a plains region. These added variety to the game and made the different areas unique. In WF&S, the entire map is flat, with just rivers and a few patches of forest. Woop-ee. Overall, don't let the cons prevent you from buying the game. It is a very fun and exciting experience which all Mount and Blade fans should have.			"

												Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword, with regards to how much I like it, and how much I don't, is quite a hard game to review. Overall it feals a lot like Mount and Blade, which is hardly suprising, but then it feels more advanced with the guns, almost like Napoleonic Wars DLC for Warband. Graphically i don't think Fire and Sword is really an inmprovement. Personally i don't think it looks very good, but let's be honest, that is never what Mount and Blade was about. If it was, they failed every time. The playstyle of the game is very much the same as all other games, with the same idea behind blocking and attacking n melee, and shooting. This is set in the early era of the invention of guns, i don't know for certain but maybe early 1700's? Either way, the uniforms for the soldiers look very old, and the guns are NOT very accurate. They also feel very 'light' and a bit too easy to aim, in comparison to that of Napoleonic Wars.The campaign is 'good'. That is about all i can say for it. It is much like the other games of it's type. Overpriced equipment, limits on army size and plenty of fetch and carry missions, and still no luck with marrying into a wealthy family. I think once you have played any Mount and Blade campaign, you have played them all. I can't think of much more to review in this game, maybe because there is nothing else. Overall, i don't like the time era very much which has turned me away from the game. I prefer the Napoleonic Wars by far. Other than that, death and melee still looks stupidly unrealistic, gunshots sound like...anything but gunshots, and the music is quite bad. Despite all this, i cannot say i don't like the game. Mount and Blade are good at making addictive games that are quite bad in comparison to other games, yet still very good. I know all that made sense, but i feel better for getting that out. 8/10. Graphics and the era ruined it for me more than anything, but i do like it.			"

												Amazing game, it captures the steppe/eastern style of warfare perfectly in the 17th century. I love this game and have enjoy it immensely a thousands times more than Warband. The line battles in Napoleonic Wars don't even match up to this game. TaleWorlds Entertainment is ripping themselves off by offering this standalone for 10$. I do not lie when I say if I could do it all over again, I would have purchased this at full price, not on sale and never picked up Warband. Its obvious more people like Warband because it's medieval theme, but for people like me, Fire and Sword is a little trip to gamer's heaven. While the loyal fanbase is moving on to Bannerlord, I'll still be on my little island, riding my war horse, bow in hand, leading Khan styled hoards, charging straight for an army of Polish Winged Hussars, while arquebus and wheelock muskets can be heard in the distance.

												Very Good....Rating: 8/10- Gameplay: 8- Multiplayer: 8- Campaign: 10- Learning Curve/Depth: 10- Community: 8Great addition to Warband, this DLC allows you to really see the gamplay come out in spades! New factions and weapons are definitly fun!Fight battles in first person using your horse and sword when you feel lucky and conquer the world as well in the strategy view. This game never seems to stop giving new twists and turns with its great sandbox environment. This game is a lot like sisters, one is always prettier and this one is not that sister (that is NW) but this one has a ton of personality!- FPS Battles- Overhead open world conquering- Strong Character Development- Strong Team Characters Developed*Note graphics are dated because the game was released a long while ago but there are modifications available that bring it up to date!**Quick update 12/27 about the story line, it is a bit flat to start with but then again it is a sandbox game so you are making the story up as you go!

												AS A GUY NEW TO MOUNT & BLADE: I think this game was really well made, as a strategy game it was fun playing it , although it was alot challenging when I had no armies at all. This Game will take you to a different level of strategic gaming. An RPG styled you can level up, your troops can level up, and your empire can be ""leveld up"" by building upgrades and hiring people. You can be an emperor/King Or you can help a KING to take over other nation. Well whatever you choose it depends on you. GOOD LUCK :) This game was alot of fun, and I'm looking foward to play this game again. (P.S this game is really really hard, so you will need patience. Or, you can use the easy way. Use cheats xD. Happy ruling )			"

												This is probably the only one or at least the only one game I know which is made after a book. The historical novel ""Ogniem i Mieczem"" or translated in English ""With fire and sword"" tells the story of the conflicts between Poland and Ukraine back then the Polish commonwealth and the Cossacks who are going up on a rebellion against the Polish. You can participate in the game and play a few amazing storylines or just roam and conquer the world			"

												Fire & Sword is like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little brother of Warband. The Singleplayer is like watching paint dry even with the additons of should be badass items like grenades. The range of clothing and weapons is dissapointing unless you want to wear the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ top in various sizes and colours all game. The game is not worth buying just for singleplayer. The only thing that comes close to saving this game is the commander game variant in Multiplayer out of my 120 odd hours about 100 of it was spent in that gamemode, it had a better feel to it than even the commander mode in NW. The smaller squad sizes and abiltiy to choose your troops specifically, gives the gamemode a much more tactical feel and when you loose a man, it hurts, it would actually sadden me when one of my 6 childeren took a bullet to the head.I will still reccomend the game because of this one gamemode, without it the game wouldnt be worth it. Even with the gamemode I would wait for a sale of the game as paying full price for it is as stupid as the game itself.			"

												First of all I would recommend this game for anyone who likes sandbox games ( for the single player mode ). One reason this game is so unique is because it has a different style of musket fighting than in the other mount and blade mods. The game gives you a sense of individuality in multiplayer, in which there is no sandbox you just battle with other people. In the other mount and blade mods and other games like those, you fight in groups so you are more of a body of men than a single soldier. In the multiplayer almost everyone moves at their own free will, like an irregular. So being a musketeer means more of you by yourself than you in a battalion of infantry. But it also allows other things, imagine a knight with a gun. This game is very fun but the multiplayer takes a while to master especially since there are a lot of hackers on some of the servers so PRACTICE!!! But other than that this game is very wide spread so it covers a lot of fields so this game is definitely one of my favorites.			"

												Good about warband: Your pc doesn`t have to be from nasa to use it on the best settings.You can spend much time on it before it gets boring, then you have the mods.Cheap.Bad about warband: OldLack of realism sometimesBugs ( not gamebreaking, but there are some)Everything is small /holdings armies) compared to reality.Mount and blade warband compared to fire and sword:Mount and blade: Much more worked onMore active serversMore and frequent updatesFire and sword:HUSSARS!!! CheaperIf you prefer to play in a fairytale world , there you go.But I think that it is much funnier playing in a historical world, with real troops and factions. The idea of fire and sword is really cool, but they haven`t worked on it enough, and the developers have left it to it`s own fate. If fire and sword had been worked on for as much as warband was, it would be epic. It lack the features warband has, and the graphic.Fire and sword has guns, this is a +. But can be frustrating gettin randomly one shot, and killed. If you are: Polish, Lithuanian, Russian, Crimean, mongol, ukrainian, swedish. Or you syphatize with any of them, You will love fire and sword (for a time) "

												Ever sense I had the pleasure of getting M&B warband ive been a huge huge huge fan of the series. Clocking in nearly 100 hours in almost no time it was easy to get lost into this medival world. Generally text bases rpg's would steer me away but not the m&b series. The combat is just sooo perfect easy to learn and soooo difficult to master. Multiplayer is tense and rewarding as you see yourself climb the leaderboards the more you play. The story mode is amazing allowing you to make a character and a story completely your own. It is difficult for new players but if you press on you will not be dissapointed. You can literally be and do anything you want. Wanna be a trader of goods make profit by selling various goods from food to silk. Maybe join a faction and pledge your allegiance to it. Do you wanna say ♥♥♥♥ that and start your own empire from the ground up to take over the entire continent. YOU CAN! its an amazing game and the new guns add another layer of difficulty and tension this is a must own so if you dont own a M&B game GET ONE DAMNIT. 10/10 who needs a life anyway when you can start your medival empire.

												WF&S is basicly a mod for M&B: Warband, sacrificing some of Warband features for actual historical background.If you played Warband, you know what to expect. If you haven't - M&B is a sandbox game. You are being thrown into a pretty big map, full of villages and cities belonging to one of five factions. And then... well, you tell me. You want to become a bandit, rob caravans and burn villages? Why not? Want to be a vigilante, taking down bandits and doing small jobs for the lords? Why wait? How about joining the faction, gaining fiefs, and taking over hostile factions? Go on. Or maybe... create your own faction, and become a king? Your call. Or you can always be a merchant. Still a good idea if you enjoy it. This applies both for warband and With fire and Sword.Factions in WF&S are Polish Commonweatlh (with their extraordinary cavalery), Kingdoms of Sweden and Russia, Cossacs and Tatars. Each faction has it's strong and weak sides, as well as it's unique units. Speaking of units, i have to say that I'm  disappointed. not by the numbers - there are plenty of them, but upgrades.... most of the units can only be upgraded to veteran/elite status. Even village recruits can be upgraded maximally to Mercenary status. Which means - obtaining unique faction units is really hard.A word about equipment. Crossbows were removed, instead, you get muskets and pistols. Pretty good and deadly weapons, if you know how to use them. Of course, they need bullets. Luckily, they refill after each battle. Weird enough, granades (yep, there are explosives. Quite powerfull, yet, quite pricy) don't refill. So if you buy pack of 3, use one - next battle you'll have 2. Quite annoying, isn't it? To sum up, if you enjoyed Warband, but got a bit bored with Swandians and other Nords, and want to try something new, but not THAT new, try WF&S.P.S: Just realised that it's just like Napoleonic wars, if it were abit more to the east, and contained single-player			"

												It feels like they shoved the Original Mount & Blade forward into time into the gunpowder age. While the guns can almost always kill someone on the first try, the trick is trying to not miss, as the gun takes a good deal of time to reload. Also, most armors with a defense of +10 or higher are expensive and harder to obtain, making it vital to avoid being shot at. The implementation of bar fights, caravan hiring system and diseases really adds into the game that I feel like the original should have had. Addicting and highly enjoyable.			"

												It feels like they shoved the Original Mount & Blade forward into time into the gunpowder age. While the guns can almost always kill someone on the first try, the trick is trying to not miss, as the gun takes a good deal of time to reload. Also, most armors with a defense of +10 or higher are expensive and harder to obtain, making it vital to avoid being shot at. The implementation of bar fights, caravan hiring system and diseases really adds into the game that I feel like the original should have had. Addicting and highly enjoyable.			"

												Very good game but only if you're into this type of games. It's cheap♥♥♥♥♥hell both on sale and off sale, right now it's like $1,24 which is a focking joke, even soda pop costs more than this gem. And I'd tell you that it is defintely worth even $20. But enough about it's value. Game has a lot of content as for such game, entertainment is almost endless, for example I've never finished any of main quests but still enjoyed it tremendously. I spend few hundred hours (off Steam) with this and never got bored. I would recommend it especially for people that aren't familiar with XVth, XVIth and XVIIth century Poland, Ukraine, Russia and Crimea - it's a great way to learn more about our culture and history. It might somehow clarify, for not acknowledged, why Crimean Crisis occured, what's going on in the Ukraine and why are these countries so important in present day world.Graphics - even though I've taken under consideration the fact that is outdated, it still sucked for its times: 4/10 (doesn't matter much if you enjoy the game itself)Music - stays in the climate of those times and those places: 9/10Content - enough for such game: 7/10Gameplay - many times I've had batter things to do (like study to not be a ♥♥♥♥ing failure) but I rather played F&S: 9/10 [disclaimer: difficult to stop playing once you get into it] Dude just focking play it, it's 1.24 for focks sake			"

												Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword is an excelent medeval RPG with a hint of strategy. You can create your character and name him/her like in any other RPG but you can also create your own story and your story will affect the stats of your character. During your adventure you can hire mercenaries in bars capture prisoners and create an army. Your army can also be upgraded so then you can get the best troops possibile on the battlefield. You can also siege castels if you are good with maniging your army. I personally give this game a 9.5/10the graphics are a bit outdated but the rest of the game functions perfectly			"

												A good Mount and Blade game, this one is set in the mid 1600s and there are a lot of firearms and different weapons than warband. In this game you will be finding party casualties a lot higher than in Waband, because a lot of firearms are a one hit kill.Slightly suffering from repetitive gameplay and not very many people playing it, but is still a solid game.8/10			"

												Warband with Muskets.Set during a tumultous time in European history. Centered in modern day Poland and surrounds, Fire & Sword does an excellent job in recreating many of the armours and troops of the time.The faction quest lines are a nice addition that set it apart from Warbands purely sandbox mode.It is pretty much just more Mount & Blade, but that is always a good thing.

I SAID CHARGE!!!We have fought and bled for this chance and you would sit it out? What of your brothers and sisters who lie dying and screaming for aid or even a swift death, crying for their mothers as they lose control of their bodies. Is this how you would honour them, with cowardice?You make me sick. What is that you ask? Why don't I charge with you? How dare you? Is it not I who has the more courageous task. Do not let the wine, food and this tent fool you. It is to dull my rage for I fear without it I would be first into the breach, and that would be the end of us all, for if I were to meet my end in such a glorious charge many, many innocents would suffer for it. I am but one man but I must carry this huge burden alone. Now order your men to CHARGE!!!

If you liked Warband but want a more Rennaisance/Medevial feel and technology then this game is perfect for you.  There are many big improvements and countless minor ones that increase the enjoyability of the game immensely.I reccomend everyone try this game out.			"

												What can I say about this game? You dont know satisfying till you line up a shot from near across the map with your rifle and you fire only to see that single silouette of the last enemy fleeing in the distance fall with a headshot. This game can be tedious to start, you constanly watching your back for a large group but after you get the hang of it, that is when it becomes wonderful. Its a great way to get rid of all that frustration out on characters just following their leaders orders.			"

												I have the original M&B (not Warband), so I have only that to compare it to, but this is probably NOT the first M&B game you should get.   That said, it's a fantastic game, with a few quirks.Best point:  Guns.  They make every battle more tense and unpredictable, because it only takes a stray bullet or two to put you out of comission fast.  While in the old M&B I would just charge in and kick♥♥♥♥♥(once I got to a certain level) even against ridiculous odds, in this one I've actually found myself strategizing, having the marksmen follow me, coming in slowly.  Aside from guns, money and supplies seem a little more plentiful and goods more fairly priced, which means I'm not always worrying whether or not I'm going to have the funds/food to pay/feed the troops.Worst point:  Glitchy main story quests.  I had to restart after several hours of play, just because of a buggy quest that would not allow me to join a faction.  Not saying it will happen to you, but it certainly dampened my enthusiasm, at least initially.  Also, the tutorial is still too basic, and doesn't explain how or why to join your faction.Bottom line:  If you only get one M&B game, it should probably be Warband (or the original, if it's on sale).  But I play this more than the original now.Note:  Have not ventured into multiplayer yet, but that's not really why I play M&B...			"

												Beware, this game is shockingly addictive! What starts as a simple, open world RPG with no clear goals or aims turns into a personalized intricate story. My character started as a simple merchant of the Cossacks and soon became a powerful political figure with an impressive army, though with the main goal of ensuring the nation's survival through peace. This game is more historical than the others, though only loosely,  and more visually detailed. The combat system is also better than the others as are much of the other aspects of the game: trading, questing, commanding, etc. The setting of this game is also more advanced, 1700's ish as there are wheellock and matchlock firearms. This game and the other Mount and Blade games are very noteworthy and worth buying on a good sale.			"

												It's a Mount and Blade game. Need I saw more? This entire series is a masterpiece. Great story, amazing gameplay, easy to learn - hard to master. Almost everything in this game is perfect. I prefer the 1600s setting over Napoleonic Wars. But like other great games - it's only good because the positives overlay the negatives. By god, there's a lot of them.- Crashes: The game crashes often. It's not really a graphics issue, it happens when interacting with an NPC. Even still, without crashing, clicking dialouge options often drops FPS waay low.- Hit Detection: Guns are the main selling point of this game. And they suck. More often than not, bullets go straight through enemies. Trying to hit anything below the abdomen is a surefire miss.- Siege: Sieges 'glitch"" out a lot. Once you've pushed pass the wall, you head down to engage the enemy... and there's an invisible wall! The AI just sits back behind this wall - none of your soldiers can hit them, they don't charge, and you can only use what's left of bullets/arrows to take them out. Then retreat, loose morale and have your soldiers suck even more.- AI: They can be stupid sometimes. AI is hard to program - I don't blame 'em.- Music: The music is buggy as hell and likes to-o r-r-r-re-n-n-ot-t-tesic-c-ch is an-n-n-nin-ng as h-e-e-e-ell. (to repeat notes which is annoying as hell)Don't let these cons fool you - this game is amazing. However, some players may get annoyed by these glitches, so be cautious			"

												Despite what people may say.. I personally think it's really good. Some of the Pros is that they have firearms. Outfits look really nice, HUGE map, and have a few story modes you can partake in (I believe it's Sweden, Russia, Commonwealth, and Crimea). Plus you can actually feel like you're in a line and if you know the commands.. Can win a battle in a single volley. Just as Carolus Rex, I was outnumbed in this battle against Russians. -4 Battle advantage. Didn't look promising for me. But I had a strong musket infantry line. And as Cavalry charged, most went down. And then the infantry came. Took out a large portion of them in two volleys. Now there is cons.. You can't create your own kingdom. Apparently the economics are bad(I haven't noticed, looks the same to me), can't recruit from villages(as far as I can tell), the huge map makes you look like an ant. So if you zoom out, you're gonna lose yourself. Or where you're trying to find. Though overall, I love the game. Very fun and unlike the Custom Battles for Napoleonic Wars of M&B, the AI can actually shoot their guns. The rating I give is Recommend and a 7/10. I think they could've done more to Fire and Sword. But it's still a good game. Don't buy into the negative ""The economy is ♥♥♥♥♥♥"" or ""Glitches everywhere"". Because I haven't found a single glitch yet. Or at least one I haven't noticed.EDIT - After playing for WAY more, I'll edit the review some more. The Story modes are The Polish Commonwealth, Russia, and The Cossaks. And you can technically ""own"" a kingdom. You just can't name it, or be for one paticular side. The fief you capture will be called the land you took it from with ""Rebels"" at the end. (For example, if you conquered Warsaw, it would be ""The Polish Commonwealth(Rebels)"". Though, unfortunately, you can't do anything with it besides own having it for yourself. Regardless, it's still very fun.			"

												Not as good as Warband since guns can one shot you even if you have a major advantage in a battle. Kind of reduces the skill on one aspect. You also can't create your own kingdom so some people might find that less enjoyable. There also isn't a workshop on steam for mods.But it's also better than Warband BECAUSE IT HAS ♥♥♥♥ING GUNS. Making money through trade is also a lot easier (but early game battles give♥♥♥♥♥♥cash).You should also get this if you prefer historical scenarios to historical fantasy.			"

												Honestly, this is my favorite game and in WFAS it just gets better. Not Only are you getting a hands on experience about a certain period in time, but you also get to make your own character, build you own army however you please, and become a lord of your own nation. If that doesn't suit you, you can become in kind to a bandit and raid ""innocent"" villages and reap to rewards. Or you may wish to be a merchant, learn the arts of trade, what sells for good where and how to make money quick. Feeling lonely playing by yourself? You can play online with friends and pplay through different scenarios. Ever wanted to besiege a castle, or fight alongside up to 200 men? you ccan do all that here in a quick battle, too. The point is, this game is great in most fields and live up to more than its expectations. Mount & Blade in general is a great series and WFAS keeps the trend goiing. 10/10. Besides graphics, I believe this is one of the best games and you will not be dissapointed by getting it. GG no re. Hope to see you online soon!			"

												This game is highly recommended for those who are into any other Mount & Blade series, Imagine being the commander with an army of the size 200, allowing up to 100 people on each side at once (Modifications to allow more). It is a truly epic game and the concepts are easy to grasp.			"

												The game is so good, I literaly bought it again on Steam, only so I can give it a positive review. With Fire and Sword is a standalone thrid party created Expansion to the Mount & Blade. It put's the game into the real 17th century Europe, and does provide player with an optional story mode, and tons and tons of new features and usage eases. After you get used to playing with Fire and Sword, the Warband itself will just feel empty, and limited. The game however requires a bit of mindset changing if you are a Warband fan already, since 17th century armies were marginally different from the villager raised armies of Calradia. The multiplayer game also provides players with slightly altered combat system (Difference can be felt only by the very dedicated players), that is the matter of taste. I persoanlly like the way combat works in Wfas more than WB, but I do understand that some people my like the feel of WB more than Wfas. Generally the game is worth your money, especially now that it is on sale. I have spent more than  1000 hours in the game over the last 4 years I have it. (Some of the features that were added to this game : - Optional Story lines- More siege possibilites- Better siege AI navigation- Training soldiers in castles and towns- A LOT of new buildings to build in your towns- Buildings now also require hiring people to operate them- Being able to choose equipment for some of your troops- Ability to talk with Guild master / Village chief without finding them in city- Building provisoric defenses to help you on field batte (wagon fort)and many, many other minor changes like loaning money, sending NPC's to academies, tavern brawls, sending merchant caravans etc.)The game however does not feature : - Marriages- Tournaments- Training camps (They serve different purpose now)			"

												Very fun game, the campaign is well made but can be confusing at times due to no official tutorial to guide you throughout all game mechanics such as persuading a highrank from another kingdom to join youMultiplayer is fun, not many people play on it though :'(			"

												Pros: Poland.        Sweden.        Mount and Blade.        Interesting campaign/storyline and weapon/armour selection.Cons: Very weird interface-backround colour when compared to it's predecessors', and this annoys me greatly.         Guns are a bit too OP.          No options to select your backround, like M&B and M&B:Warband had.         Dull gameplay when not in battle.Overall I must give it 8/10. While it's a pretty bad game compared to those before it, it is alright as a standalone.I did not rate it as standalone though, if I did it would achieve an 11/10. The fact that Poland was in the game made it very amazing.PolandPolandPolandPolandYou know you love Poland...			"

												Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword is a game many fans don't view in a positive light, and while I cant say exactly why, I can make a few guesses. The biggest to me is probably the introduction of firearms into Mount and Blade, its pretty powerful. early on, and I myself never had any problems just riding into huge battles alone on horseback just to shot dead most enemies before finishing off any stragglers. That being said I feel like it is also missing some of the broader features of Warband, thus losing some of the variation in gameplay. I have not spent as much time with the game, on or off Steam as I have with the other two Mount and Blade games so I don't have as much experience with Mount and Blade with Fire and Sword. That being said, I myself Still really like the game and recommend Mount and Blade fans try it.			"

												This is one of the best games I've ever played. The very first time I played was around 4 years after it was released, at the time I played the demo just to check if it's worth it. The demo was almost nothing and you didn't have too much time to play but I did buy it because I wanted to see what I could do next.I've played this game for a long while, about 4 years now, when I started really enjoying it. It is an old game, yes, but it's worth every dollar I spent on it. This game might not be the most epic game in the world but it's still fun to just go around, completing missions, getting an army and getting to rule land. The game has multiplayer as well, which makes it even more fun. Sadly not a lot of people play Fire&Sword.I don't have too much to say about this game. It's just really fun and I'm sure some will really get into it. I've never seen any bugs and glitches in this game. This game runs smoothly with nothing bad happening, though it might crash rarely, but it's no problem if you save your game from time to time.			"

												I'm still adamant this game will be awesome, so don't pass judgement just yet. They do a lot of bugfixing in this game, they just have a bit of a slow development cycle. They still need to fix achievements, as they don't appear.The game strikes me more as a 'P2P Mod' than a typical expansion. It also appears to compound the problems of the last game, namly starting out, since 7 bandits with guns are much more likely to take out the lone wanderer than 7 bandits in previous games. However, all the open-endedness is still there, now in some kind of maybe Russian land but now with added featuers like banks and most importantly: guns. For all you people who read the last review and needed guns, but were too stupid to figure out how to install a mod: get this. If you like Mount&Blade and can deal with the above problems: get this. If you havn't really tried the series and want to play: go get Warband. Bugs, guns, fun.			"

												So i have noticed most people have been comparing With Fire and Sword to Warband. Warband is good in that it has tons of mods to make the game more and more interesting. However With Fire and Sword the history in the singleplayer is good (not saying its perfect). The gameplay is good. The graphics, to me, Mount and blade wouldnt be mount and blade without the not great graphics. They're decent graphics though and i like it that way. Warband does allow you to just be a factionless bandit hunter, and WFaS its very limited.  But just build your way up by trading goods between factions, earn good money, buy mercenaries for your army, pick a faction and join them, or be gutsy and take on a faction by yourself. (i dont play with cheats).			"

Yes the grapics are old but the game play is fantastic. Only problem is, if you have no ranged or cav and you are vs cav, prepare to be kited and destroyed i did 1v20 at level 1. They enemy had no ranged weapons so I just rode my horse around in a circle poping off pistol rounds until people would route. I would go after then slice them and repeat. Though when you get into big battles you better know how to issuse to correct commands If not it will cost you the game I say 9/10.			"

												Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword is just not as good as Warband but will still have you playing for hours when you get into it.WFaS made by a polish company (as far as i can remember) set in the 15th to 17th century adds guns to madness that is 'MaB' but personally i still prefer the Swords and combat rather than ranged weapons.The map personally is not great but it is only a map, everything else is just the same as it was in Warband. Just a storyline to go with the action, new factions based on true history and plenty of men to boot.This Warband focuses less on allowing you to create your own faction and more or less forces you to become a Vassal. Again nothing wrong with that, it's just very unrewarding claiming your own kingdom so i tend to avoid it.Overall, everything is the same you just may not like it as much but it is still woth the money easily and the online also remains with guns helping increase the diversity of troops.I grant this a solid 8.8/10			"

It seems to be one of those games that you might have to give it time for it to warm on you, otherwise it won't at all.I don't mind it, it has some decent multiplayer modes which make it unique and the other game modes aren't that bad.

												I don't have any words to describe how awesome this game is, get it, and do it now.I run a party of drunk russians with maces, we hit bandits, we take their loot, we take their money, we take them prisoners and we sell then like slaves, then we get drunk in a taver and fight.Thats enough for you to buy it.Keep on the look out for noscopes from the other side of the world by some musketer called xXx_Dragon_xXx.Oh and ♥♥♥♥ the Polish Commonwealth.

												Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword is a great expansion to the classic Warband game. Not only does it add guns, but a whole new map and story too. New mechanics and crisp gameplay make this another well done experience. Must buy for Warband fans.			"

												I'm still adamant this game will be awesome, so don't pass judgement just yet. They do a lot of bugfixing in this game, they just have a bit of a slow development cycle. They still need to fix achievements, as they don't appear.The game strikes me more as a 'P2P Mod' than a typical expansion. It also appears to compound the problems of the last game, namly starting out, since 7 bandits with guns are much more likely to take out the lone wanderer than 7 bandits in previous games. However, all the open-endedness is still there, now in some kind of maybe Russian land but now with added featuers like banks and most importantly: guns. For all you people who read the last review and needed guns, but were too stupid to figure out how to install a mod: get this. If you like Mount&Blade and can deal with the above problems: get this. If you havn't really tried the series and want to play: go get Warband. Bugs, guns, fun.			"

												So i have noticed most people have been comparing With Fire and Sword to Warband. Warband is good in that it has tons of mods to make the game more and more interesting. However With Fire and Sword the history in the singleplayer is good (not saying its perfect). The gameplay is good. The graphics, to me, Mount and blade wouldnt be mount and blade without the not great graphics. They're decent graphics though and i like it that way. Warband does allow you to just be a factionless bandit hunter, and WFaS its very limited.  But just build your way up by trading goods between factions, earn good money, buy mercenaries for your army, pick a faction and join them, or be gutsy and take on a faction by yourself. (i dont play with cheats).			"

												I have to say, I have only played the same old games all the time. Never wanted to venture away from my comfort zone. But this game kinda just grabbed my attention. Yes the grapics are old but the game play is fantastic. Only problem is, if you have no ranged or cav and you are vs cav, prepare to be kited and destroyed i did 1v20 at level 1. They enemy had no ranged weapons so I just rode my horse around in a circle poping off pistol rounds until people would route. I would go after then slice them and repeat. Though when you get into big battles you better know how to issuse to correct commands If not it will cost you the game I say 9/10.			"

												Nothing like Mount & Blade: Warband in terms of how good it is but it still is decent. Its factions aren't made up and the campaign map is of Eastern Europe. The multiplayer is sort of like Native Mount & Blade and Napoleonic Wars mashed together but not perfect. It seems to be one of those games that you might have to give it time for it to warm on you, otherwise it won't at all.I don't mind it, it has some decent multiplayer modes which make it unique and the other game modes aren't that bad.

												Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword It is a good game and i recommend this for all. My computer is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥and i can run this amazing game really smoothly and my computer isnt even a gaming computer anyways.heres the good about this game: the fighting in this game is really good and it is really fun to play with friends to have a good laugh with and team up agains other players you can customize your character Male/Female and make them look how ever you would like. There are a couple of game modes you can play like survival, Teamdeath match, Deathmatch and so on. Theres even a campaign so if you dont feel like playing with other players you can go on there or in private match to play by your self.The bad: The shooting in this game is kind of hard you have to aim in a certain area to shoot someone in the head, leg, chest etc. if you are on a horse and your weapon is a  spear or sword you have to aim in a certain way as well to kill them easy. If you are on foot and about to fight someone and they have a sword and you have a spear it is hard to attack back because the sword is quicker than the spear AND YES there is weight heavy armor with a broad sword or a heavy pike you will run slow and if your getting attacked and trying to run put away your weapon and run.BUT all in all ithis is a great game i highly recommend it hope this helped :)			"

It has a good variety of different ways to play because of its large number of different kinds of muskets, carbines, pistols, bows, one and two handed swords, and polearms.

												Want a somewhat realistic story on medieval times? Well... this game won't exactly provide that. Ultimately, it is fun to play but they took out the concept that if you're a woman, you have a harder time. This takes out a part of the series and it is a let down since people enjoyed this concept. I feel like people got mad and they let these people have their way and took it out. Mostly, the game is fun. I enjoy using the guns in the game and they seem overpowered but the reloading is a downfall to it. Like the crossbow. Better than the bow, but you sacrafice some reload time. If you enjoyed the concept of women having a harsher time in Warband and it's something that you saw as something to benefit to your replay value and having mods in the Steam Workshop, well, I don't recommend the game. If you are a huge fan of Mount & Blade either way, then I do see this as a game for you.			"

												154 hours clocked on this game and now i am finally ready to tell my verdict - Stay away. Game is awesome but the end game is not working well even by M&B standards. No patches coming so it's basicaly just a broken heap. There is no way to reach any kind of satisfactory end game state with this game. Sandbox or not.  Get Warband or even the first one if you must.

												It's a very enjoyable game. However I found it very copy and paste from Mount and Blade Warband... except this has guns. So does Warband with modifications and lets be honest Warband is a lot more fun and most mods and a lot more stuff such as weapons, armor, and factions. So I would say pick warband... This game is great fun but just cannot compare to warband...  So in all Warband is better in my opinion but this game does add some nice features and I still have to recommend it.			"

												With Fire&Sword also builds and expands upon the highly regarded combat system from Mount&Blade:Warband. Firearms have been introduced to the battlefield, opening up exciting new play styles and options. Players can also utilize explosives for taking out groups of foes or to breach castle walls. In addition to the enhanced singleplayer mode, With Fire and Sword also provides a host of original multiplayer content including the new Captain Mode which allows players to control their own forces in online matches.

												This game is based on the 1998 Polish movie ""Fire and Sword"".  It provides a historical backdrop for 1650's warfare in central Europe, including Cossack, Tatar, Muscovite, Polish and Swedish units and cities.  Some mods extend the map and available units too.Game is ungoddly awesome.  Something about riding a horse while shooting - it's a similar feeling to flying.  You can command units with great precision and it takes a while to master.  But what a rush to play - even though I completely suck at fighting, buidling up an army and working out the tactics is great.  The AI is is pretty good too (I'm guessing completely based on Behavior Trees).  Sometimes I play the sniper while the rest of the army is skirmishing - really hard to get in a good shot - and very satisfying when it connects.  These are ancient guns and not rifled, so they aren't very accurate from long-range.Also playing solo (no army yet) and taking out the horse of some jerk who's tearing me up - it's a big rush of adrenhaline!Economy is quite clever, where you can drive down market prices and then send caravans at a discount.  Can also take out loans in a pinch.If you quit the tutorial immediately, then it's a little more challenging to start with no money, no gun and no horse - I think this is the best way to play it.

												I kinda liked this before I found a mod for Warband that's like this 'game', except 10 times better, with new animations, far better weapon noises, more accurate clothing, balanced-out calvary (kinda), seperate pistol/musket ammo types (Realism) a bigger map, more factions, naval-related stuff, and more that I still haven't found yet. Oh, there's also 12-pounder cannons.Villages don't have trained soldiers in the mod, despite the fact that 'Fire & Sword' does. Seriously, you're fighting a VILLAGE! Villages tend to not contain 50+ soldiers. With Muskets.The mod's called L'Aigle, and despite being in Alpha, Warband didn't crash at all for the entire day, compared to Google Chrome's whopping 5 times from simply right-clicking. :^)Don't waste your cash on this, just buy Warband if you haven't already and check out the full-conversion mods.

												Main questline is somewhat lazy and kind of disappears. Game has less content than some free community made mods yet costs 10 dollars for some reason. The Eagle and the Radiant Cross or it's submod have probably the same amount or more of content and is completely free. There's also a wide variety of mods that go above and beyond like Gekokujo, Floris, Pendor, Brytenwalda, Anno Domini, and much more yet this expansion doesn't really seem to bring anything to the table like the other two expansions. Very uninteresting map, lacks detail and makes the eastern european theme very drab. All in all not really worth buying imo. Napoleonic Wars and Viking Conquest are far superior expansions while this just feels like a community mod. If it was made by a fan I'd give it a 8/10, but since its made by taleworlds and charges money, more like a 5/10 in my opinion.			"

												For an old it still makes up for its amazing immersion to the battlefield.The concepts of bringing new weaponry to seiging and invading enemy is very fun.To build a wagon fort to use when there is so much calvary to give you an advantage,to blow a hole in the castle wall so your infantry can run in quickly without being shot down,and to run in and point blank double shot an enemy to the head.It adds quite alot from the regular Mount and Blade Warband but to not to much to let you play for hours on end.The quest are repetitive after a while and it reminds me of a mod for Warband than a new game. It adds nice armor and new weapons but it seems too small. I kinda wished for more variety.Overall its a nice expansion to the world of Calradia. 8/10			"

												If you dont know mount and blade already, it is a realistic medieval simulation role playing sandbox game. At least I just called it that. For those who want to go god of war style, look elsewhere, because you will die in the 3rd second of combat:D It has a steep learning curve and realism can be irritating at times (like getting killed by a blow, or two) if you value realism over mindless hack and slash, I recommend this game. Although the main storyline is quite weak in the game that you barely recognised its existence, there are tons of things to do for those who like to explore. Graphics are not the best, but coming from a small studio, this game is a valuable underdog. "

												Notably better than vanilla Warband, but this game suffers from one great big insurmountable flaw: It is made entirely redundant by Warband Workshop mods. If you own warband, download a total conversion mod from the Steam Workshop (Perisino is my personal favourite). BOOM! Instant Mount and Blade game, and its free. If this had Steam Workshop support, it would no doubt have an excelent modding community of its own, but without it, there is really no reason to buy this game. Let this be a lesson TaleWorlds! The new game had better have workshop support if you want it to replace warband.			"

												Whereas before we not only got a Mount, a Blade AND a Warband, now we have just another sword and a fire. Granted, the shooting in this has many mechanics used in ""Populous"" but it just feels a little less musical. I can't help think that is a bad thing.			"

Good game but this is WFaS in a nutshell. Lords-Go get me food-Give me troops-Follow me-Give me money-Get money for meAsk lords for help or to follow you-Spits in your face and insults you			"

												I thought the addition of guns would break Mount&Blade's fine sense of balance, but I find they work surprisingly well: they're extremely powerful, but inaccurate and slow to reload, so you can't just go Rambo on everyone. There are other changes and improvements on the series' formula as well, but whether you want to get WF&S hinges entirely on whether you enjoy the guns and the setting. Personally, I find the time period and location utterly uninteresting, but if it appeals to you, then this is something you owe it to yourself to investigate. I still prefer Warband, but don't let me spoil your fun.			"

And guess what else since im at the beginning, my army is small and is murdered with little effort on there part and leaves me defenseless getting spooned by 8 bandits at once. On the bright side as you progress through the story and little by little you become more supierior then these problems dont have much meaning. Also it is a good idea to remember the map as soon as possible it will help you with your quests. This game now features guns now which is a nice upgrade from the previous games in the series.

												Where could I start?  There is nothing wrong with this game.  Living up to the standards I've come to expect from Paradox Interactive, this game is perfection, fine-tuned.Some say that introducing firearms ruined the game, but that isn't true.  It made it different, and people hate change.  Playing through the campaign of this game blasts you with the ideal that indeed, graphics don't need to be perfect to have a completly immersive game. Huge battles that are decently historically accurate (as far as weapons / armors go), and an excellent team-building system make this one of the epics.  A game I ALWAYS come back to.  Living the life of the gun-runner in the medieval era, or any other sort of life for that matter, makes this game great for me.  But you could approach victory however you please.So what are you waiting for?  Buy it. 10/10.			"

												If you dont know mount and blade already, it is a realistic medieval simulation role playing sandbox game. At least I just called it that. For those who want to go god of war style, look elsewhere, because you will die in the 3rd second of combat:D It has a steep learning curve and realism can be irritating at times (like getting killed by a blow, or two) if you value realism over mindless hack and slash, I recommend this game. Although the main storyline is quite weak in the game that you barely recognised its existence, there are tons of things to do for those who like to explore. Graphics are not the best, but coming from a small studio, this game is a valuable underdog. "

												Not a bad game, but definitely the weakest game in the series, alhough that is subjective. My personal gripes are:Guns detract from the strategy, it sort of devolves into nothing but shooting ranges.Getting randomly oneshot from across the map by said guns feels really bad.The game in general feels very simplified and dumbed down, less weapons, less troops, less content overall.The factions completely lack the personality and interesting lore of Warband, they all feel very bland and samey.Just get warband, there are endless amazing mods for warband that are worth checking out as well.

												Personal rating: 4/10replayability: N/ABudget: Don't bother. Get warband instead. Lenght: InfinateNote: Below is my review from warband. Imagine that it's basically like Warband, but not as good. Which isn't saying much to begin with! This title simply takes away the few features that made warband addictive and entertaining. While definately entertaining, this game feels like it was never fully developed and was released in it's beta, or even alpha state. It presents a weird mix of game types, from RPG like conversations via dialogue options to Heroes of Might and Magic style overland map travelling to open combat in third person, like in Oblivion. While this may sound great, and is infact entertaning (for a while), the game is lacking in so many departments that it's almost embarrasing. It could have been so much, but unfortunately, this is what we get. The worst about this game, is, that it's unwinnable. There is no purpose in the game, so it's just a sandbox freeroam game with randomly generated missions and encounters. That get's old quickly.While not a true paradox game, I can see why paradox published it. There are some similar elements. This game is extremely addicting and can feel overwhelming at times, which is what hooks the player. The potential of going from lowly peasant to ruler of an empire and the danger of losing it all even at that point. There is so much unused potential in this game. A new title is coming out soon, a ""sequel"" of sorts, I recommend waiting for that.			"

In a week or two ill probably go back to playing Warband anyway if im still not happy with this game.Pros:Its got guns, grenades, swords, bows, etcthere are a lot of people playing around 3000 right now so its good for multiplayerthere are more various jobs to do and a lot of trainingConsIts hard to understand the difference between a Fortress and a CityNot enough places/troops to recruitMultiplayer is too laggyGuns are too overpowered and have terrible reload time7.2/10----Thanks for reading my review!

Get your pocporn cus we gonna be here for a while ^.^````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````-Basic Introduction-This game is set in the years of ol' 1600's. Weapons of that era were captured partially. Armour is set good,Nice set of melee weapons and also ranged- muskets and bows, pistols and grenades.````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````-Multiplayer-*Drawbacks*There are no clans/regiments or not that any time I come on it I see them. I bought this game to play in a clan and I really was disappointed when there wasn't any multiplayer :(There is that *lag* fire ( Firing when you do not release your mouse button to fire your ranged +++*Good things*Alot of players tend to play Captain Co-op. I love it! This is when you team up with other players to defeat the oncoming raids of AI soldiers.Funny stuff happens when you kill a guy off a castle wall into a pond xDAlso got a very cool story line- Deluge, Black mace :P Good achievements to be had also.to be continued ( Need to play more so I need ideas!!! =D )			"

 How I played this game: (difficulty)	 1. 	 Setting the difficulty to easy. (WTF too easy?) 2.	 Setting the difficulty to normal. (Yep it's like I'm playing the normal mount & blade version it's  still easy) 3.	 Setting the difficulty to hard. (OMFG! THIS IS SO UNFAAAIIRRRR THIS GAME SUCKS! LOOK AT THAT STARTING GAME ALREADY LOSING F*CK! I'M GONNA UNINSTALL THIS SH*T!! F*CK!!!!!!!!) How the gameplay works: (easy, normal, hard)    1. 	 Always comes with the tutorial when you started a new game. (even tho there's a tutorial in the main menu) 2.	 Starting quest [bandit problem, tax problem, AND F*CKING SALT! (SALT IS VERY HARD TO FIND)] the elder will give you a quest which you will spend 13 days in the game!!! THAT ONE IS TO FIND 3 BAGS/SACKS OF SALT!!! 3.	 The most exciting part is, when your enemies have a gun DON'T CHARGE ALONE! Because when they start to shoot you at the same time you'll die! Uhm I mean knocked unconcious. (TRUE STORY! DON'T CHARGE ALONE!) 4.	 When the lord asks you to collect his tax and accept it you'll not face him ever again. Tips & Tricks:	 1. 	 If you want to defeat the Kingdom before you do it take some ""collecting taxes"" to the lords because after that you'll not find him/her anywhere! 2. 	 Want the game more easier? Well I got a 1 good tip for you -->  ENABLE YOUR CHEATS!	 "

I was also expecting a completely new game but it has many of the asame quest (and with the same dialogue) as warband aswell as some of the castle being just retextured warband castles. THat brings me to another point. I dislike the textures for this game such as in the castle etc because, to me, they seem bland and of lower quality.If you haven't already I suggest buying warband over this game.			"

												Для бОльшей аутентичности очень советую поставить WFaS Enhanced mod, игра без него смотрится далеко не так аутентично. Хотя сама по себе она целиком оправдала возложенные на серию надежды: Графика лучше, геймплей бодрее, система взаимоотношений НПС и персонажа теперь нечто большее, чем то убожество, что было в первом M&B. Я очень удивлён что игра стоит дешевле других частей, но это уже причуды разработчиков. Поскольку эта игра может считаться одной из фундаментальных творений игровой индустрии на то время, ставлю ей 9/10, да и то лишь за изредка встречающиеся баги, связанные с текстурами.			"

												As a fresh face to the Mount & Blade series, and also a fairly seasoned veteran at the Elders Scrolls series, I had *some* difficulty learning this game. Whether is be from the fairly complex battle system, to the robust and dynamic economic system, all the way to just not having my hand held. The reason for me being, initially, overwhelmed, was that there isn't really any direction given to you (so, for all of you players who hate linearity, take a look at this). Essentially, you're thrown into a huge world after you complete the short tutorial, and with only two towns to note, you have no main quest line (at first), no grandiose story (also, at first), nothing. ""Why?"" you may ask. The answer is one that, albeit cliché, is simply because it's up to you.  With literally no bars to take note of, you can: make a living learning all of the best trading items and locations, be sure to spend a ton of money on mercs though; plunder every poor village you see, using the money and supplies to further expand your small band of unruly thieves; play the noble boot-licker, and live a virtuous and honest life as you win further glory for your lord. As the parenthetical phrases have said, the lack of a story is only in the beginning, when you're not a particularly notable character. Though, you could completely ignore that story, and still fully enjoy every aspect of the game.Aside from the story, the combat system is something to take note of. There are speed multipliers that aide or detract from damage done on horseback, range and reach modifiers that take note of how much damage point X on a longsword does compared to point Y or Z, guns that can literally change the tide of any fight (I've been one shot so much while prancing around on my pony...), and fun archery, crossbows, and throwing weapons, all affected by range of the shot, location of impact, and all that nitty gritty stuff. As a side note, it's a fun little challenge (and I use that term loosely) to find a band of 10+ looters, or similarly weak enemies, and fight them by yourself, I've taken grenades into those fights, and run circles around the enemy to herd them, in a sense, and then just toss a grenade ;)The characters are rather lackluster unless you're dealing with specific, named characters, who all have their own sets of morals and values. For an example, a more noble character may leave your party if you're constantly bullying small villages, whereas the more violent-loving characters may shun you from running from a fight - yes, even if it's your 20 man squad of peasants, versus a noble's 100 man squad of elite soldiers. Named characters also have their own skill sets, so finding the proper balance of brain and brawn, or just pure brawn, is all a matter of personal taste and is affected by your long-term goals for a character. The political aspect of each faction and character is something that I find incredibly amusing as well, blindly taking quests from the nobles of Sweden may land you as the enemy against whomever they're currently at war with, thus losing a key trading outpost (I say this from experience, be careful). This game hasn't won any awards for its graphics, they can be buggy, low res, low poly-count, and all of the above at one time. And, speaking of bugs, there can be a lot. Tearing in a lot of terrain, a complete lack of rendering in the overworld, and just flat out moronic AI, the pros outweigh the cons, immensely. Multiplayer is something that I didn't bother with much, but I have dabbled. From what I've played, the classes seem fairly balanced, and the 'kill to coin' system if very reminiscent of CS.In the case of Warband vs With Fire and Sword, I'd have to take WFaS. Overall, the game feels slightly more immersive with the landmass being real geographical locations, cheaper costs for mercenaries (which actually did take away a lot of frustration from a lot of my merchant characters), and guns. Guns are incredibly amusing to play with since the game takes place in the period of time when gunpowder just began to be utilized for firearms and explosives. There's also some quality of life improvements with the guildmaster from warband being replaced by the mayor, who's accessible from a town menu, there are also more towns you can actually visit, rather than large amounts of fortresses that only house nobles. Sadly, though, I have yet to see tournaments in any of the towns, and that was a major point of fun for a lot of my playthroughs. All in all, a fantastic game, with a lot more than you could hope for. Don't judge a game by its graphics: 9/10			"

Hell, its not even the best warband mod that the developer sells (that would be Napoleonic Wars by the way). Just buy Warband, and if you've already played it to death, go download Brytenwalda for it. You'll enjoy yourself a hundred times more than playing this.			"

												I loved M&B: Warband and really liked With fire and sword when I started it, as someone that likes to create my own adventure and has a lot of Warband I didn't read guides, just started playing. I started to make my fortune by trading, got up to almost 500,000 thalers, good gear, all the needed companions and a good core army when I wanted to start joining factions for the combat experience and found out I can't, somewhere along the way I randomly started a ""main quest"" of a faction I don't even like which cannot be canceled and forbids me from joining any faction or taking up any merc work, more than 10 hours of trading and building wasted... With fire and sword has a interesting concept however due to bad optimization, bugged quests and randomly denying parts  of the game I can't recommend it, if you want the M&B create your own adventure experience just stick with Warband...

												This Mount & Blade was poorly done.  It just doesn't compare to its predecessors.To start off, I'd like to say that Fire & Sword has an incredible problem with experience points and leveling, and on top of that, if you want to level up, you've got to kill countless people with firearms- It doesn't matter what armor you wear, damage taken can be as low as 16 points in heavy armor to a full 60 with none.  You get shot in this game, your fun is over.  The big problem there is that firearms are actually quite common to everyone except you...  Want a good one?  Be prepared to spend $2000 or more.  In addition to that, when you're actually trying to ""aim"", be prepared for ridiculous misses, while the enemy seems to have no trouble hitting you from halfway across the map.Aside from the experience points problem and the stacked cards against you in the gun-crazed Eastern European atmosphere, the balance for the game feels a bit off, and nothing is as ""pretty"" here as Warband.  The map is overall darker, the bandits seem less regional as they are in Warband, and the game feels less alive than Warband.  My biggest problem with it?  It just isn't worth it when an infuriating mistake occurs.  Ride by a reloading musketman, put the reticle over him, miss about 2 paces from him, and get shot in the back as you're riding away...  When you finally *DO* kill him, you get 30 experience points.  Yay you.  23 more to go before you'll level up!Mistakes like these show how little thought and reception was given to community concerns.  It's a dumbed down model, and I've been pushed away by the ridiculous level-up problems.In addition to these slated issues, another problem is in regard to armor.  Armor is completely unbalanced, and much of the decent equipment is ridiculously overpriced.  There seems to have been no thought put into balancing the economy in that regard, which makes it nigh-impossible to outfit yourself to survive a few bullets.  So how do you deal with these gun crazy fools when your armor- and that which you manage to buy- barely protects you?  Spend about 20 minutes circling 13 Brigands until they run out of ammo, and you'll see my point.This M&B is a definite Thumbs Down.  It just wasn't well-thought-out, and I don't think development was very receptive to the community on its issues, and there are many.			"

												TL DR version:Buy if you like:70 musketeers firing their guns all at onceAvoid if you dislike:Buggy questsNo right to rule systemLack in variety of weaponsLong Version:I've played Mount and Blade Warband with Floris Mod and before.The only epic thing in Fire and Sword is the ALL FIRE NOW command you give to all your musket-holding soldiers and watching the enemies fall as your volleys pierces through every armor in the game.Other than that, the game and current mods don't allow you to be a ruler (no right to rule system like in warband), the soldiers can only be upgraded into a better version of themselves, unlike in warband where a simple militia can be upgraded into a pikeman, a crossbowman, a horse archer, a lancer or throwing axeman. The weapons choice in this game is very poor as well and lack in variety. There's only four ranged weapons - Pistol, Carbine, Musket and Bow, where Musket is the only ranged powder weapon that can't be used on horseback. The melee weapons lack the cosmetic appeal they need.Oh, and many of the quests are bugged as well to the point that you will have to consult a walkthrough in order to avoid the bugs. There is also a lack of ways to increase your renown in the game where there are only small groups of bandits and you'll be forced to fight the lords of one nation if you want to increase your renown faster than escorting caravans to towns and picking off small bands of bandits.

												i have an amazing recipe for APPLE PIE 1 3/4 cups (260g) plain flour1/2 cup (75g) self-raising flour185g unsalted butter, chilled, cut into small pieces1/3 cup (75g) caster sugar2 eggs1 tablespoon milkDemerara or caster sugar, to sprinkleFILLING 8 large Granny Smith applesJuice of 1 lemon45g unsalted butter1/2 cup (110g) caster sugar1 teaspoon ground cinnamon1/4 teaspoon ground clovesstep 1Sift flours and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl. Add butter and rub lightly into flour with your fingertips. Lift mixture high above the bowl as you rub, to incorporate air into the pastry and make it lighter. Continue until mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs, then stir through sugar. Lightly beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon chilled water, then drizzle over flour mixture. Start to bring the dough together by cutting the liquid into the dough with a blunt knife, then form into a smooth ball with your hands, adding a little more water if necessary. Divide dough into two pieces, one slightly larger than the other. Wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for 30 minutes.Step 2To make the filling, peel and core the apples, and cut each into 8 pieces. Toss immediately with lemon juice in a large bowl, to prevent apples from discolouring. Place the butter and sugar in a large frypan over medium-low heat. When butter has melted, add apples and spices, then stir to coat. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes or until apples have softened. Set aside to cool.Step 3Roll out the larger pastry ball on a floured workbench to a 30cm circle (about 2mm thick). Roll pastry around rolling pin, then unroll over a 22cm metal pie dish. Gently press into corners and allow excess to overhang. Place filling in base with a slotted spoon. Roll the small pastry piece to a 25cm circle. Beat remaining egg with milk, brushing some on rim of the base. Top with small pastry.Step 4Lift the pie dish and cut excess pastry from edges with a sharp knife. Crimp edges of pastry together with your fingers. Chill for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 180°C, place pie dish on a baking tray. Brush top of pie with more beaten egg, sprinkle with demerara or caster sugar. Cut four small air vents in the centre of the pie and bake for 45 minutes or until golden brown.			"

												a quick quote from a friend that loves Mount and Blade: Warband. "" Mount and Blade with Fire and Sword is ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥as ♥♥♥♥"". He's not right but he's not wrong either.  Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword tries to take a risky step of adding guns to a mostly medieval franchise, it succeeds in some ways, but it is a terrible attempt in another way. Napoleonic Wars did a much better job doing this and it costs the same.  Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword is a downgrade of Warband in the aspect that Mount and Blade's best part was it's fantastic medieval environments and amazing gameplay which is what sparked and rose Warband to fame. With Fire and Sword throws it all to the garbage and takes away the Medieval tag by adding GUNS! I say spend your money on Napoleonic Wars, because that game is money well spent with its endless gameplay and possibilities. They spent more time into a DLC then a Standalone Expansion because  Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword has next to nothing new to add to the series other then a game with guns but the sad truth is, Napoleonic Wars does it better. Recommended on Sale and if you are hungry for Mount and Blade, but with MnB:Warband mods, i doubt that will happen.			"

												A good game with a bit more of a challenge early on when you are coming over from Mount & Blade: Warband.The firearms are nice in the story mod of the game and not just for online multyplayer like with Napoleon.  Also Grenades, they shouldn't be as much fun as they are.Another nice change with this one are the added options for castle sieges though the option to poision the cities water really is underwhelming.  When it works it only ever seems to kill less then 20 of the garrisoned troops.On the downside, it would seem some of the achievements seem broken.			"

												The expansions comes with added guns and a bit more content/characters/missions. It's still worth the money because the gunplay is lots of fun. If you like Warband a lot, definitely get this during a sale. If the whole pack is on sale, I recommend you play Warband first before trying this expansion.This is not DLC. This is an expansion. It does not add anything to the Warband game world so to speak, you launch this expansions as a separate game.			"

												I have quite a few hours on this off Steam. It's one of the few games I like enough to buy twice.Most people who've played both seem to like Warband better, and I'd have to agree that certain aspects of WB do make it a little easier to get into, one of the major ones being that you'll probably never get killed by some ♥♥♥♥ing peasant with a musket in the land of Calradia.That said, I think that the majority of the people who don't like this game much only feel that way because they don't realize that you need to play it very differently than Warband. It's about commanding your army more than glorious personal combat, all because of the guns. This is a good thing, really, because an unskilled dude being able to kill someone who'd trained all their life for melee combat and had invested a small fortune into their equipment by simply pointing a cheap, crude little stick at them is what ended the feudal era. Very, very few games set around this time (or even far, far later) really accurately represent how game changing a gun really is.The key to having alot of fun with F&S is to play it more like a first person strategy game. Don't charge in there with your mass of calvalry, maybe telling your handful of ranged guys to stand just a ways off of where the collision will occur. This will probably work if you personally don't get killed, but you will take some ridiculous losses. Instead, fight like you would if you were engaging a wall of enemies with deadly ranged weapons. Move up behind hills, set your own musket lines up, and let them slug it out  for a bit. Move around the side with your calvalry. When the moment is right, and the enemy is a little scattered, fix your bayonettes, sound the pipes, and ♥♥♥♥ing CHARGE! Your losses will still be noticable, depending on your army composition, but you can always get more conscripts, and the odds of you getting shot by just one or two ♥♥♥♥ing peasants with muskets is pretty slim.This is the uncaring, unglorious, bloody fighting that is musket warfare, and this is the whole reason to buy this game.In every other way, the game is actually quite a bit better than vanilla Warband. UI is better, menus are better, recruiting isn't really better per se, but much more realistic. Trade is better, etc. etc. It's sort of like fallout 3 and New Vegas - one seems pretty great untill you play the other, then it's hard to really go back and get the same sort of enjoyment out of it.Buy it if you want to support a good franchise, or if you think fighting with muskets sounds fun. If you want glorious personal combat, the ability to strike terror into your foes with Winged Helms, and battles that can always be won just by riding your horse in a circle, buy Warband instead.

												Mount And Blade: With Fire & SwordI remember i had just still only known the M&B series for such little time, yet after playing Warband. I had to keep going and surely With Fire & Sword kept me at the edge of my seat taking up hour by hour as i couldn't be contained from this outstanding expansion to this godlike franchise.A truely amazing experience i've had with this game for only three days.This expansion or stand-alone DLC for Mount And Blade: Warband (Another great piece to buy) is a definite must have for any PC gamer. Taking place in 17th Century Europe, firearms and explosives have now been introduced causing much more of a threat in casualties. As well as five nations ranging from the Polish, Swedes, Ukranian, Russian and Arabian decent are in constant war with each other. Whilst you, a wandering mercenary must find your calling to either work for these factions and conquer all of Eastern Europe. Or manage to raise an army of young recruits and mercenaries to be a lone wolf and conquer all of Europe yourself.There is also a story for the Poles, Ukranians and Russians in case you want to play in a more linear fashion.Other than that, combat still feels fantastic aside from the old 17th century firearms being able to one shot both you and the AI,  but thats just really my only downside to this game.Realistic, fun, and endlessly entertaining. I recommend Mount And Blade: With Fire & Sword to either veterans of the M&B series or maybe those who wish to start off their long and exciting journey into this series. But be advised, if you are a first timer to this series and buy this, just note the start in this game is far more complex than the start in Warband.Yet at the same time, both Warband and With Fire & Sword are honestly worth the cheap price it asks.

												Overall the game is as enjoyable as you'd expect if you're already a series fan, but with strange omissions and the only new features worthy of mention being a new multi-player mode and guns, coupled with the less interesting map, I can recommend it as a series fan, and to support the series' future, but put simply, guns aside, it just isn't as good as Warband.+Guns are a welcome addition to combat+Gameplay is as good as always+Caravans are awesome-Strange omissions like female player characters and tournaments-Map is a bit bland compared to Calradia-It's not as good as WarbandPlayability: 9 out of 10Replayability: 8 out of 10Graphics: 7 out of 10Sound: 8 out of 10Overall: 8 out of 10 "

												This game's mechanics are terrible, stick with mount and blade if you donj't want to rage at the game screwing you over (as it does many times).Some examples of this:Sided with Poland, we were doing well until two polish cities (one was Warsaw) mysteriously became Swedish (no siege, no reports of being conquered).King constantly sieges city that is alternately taken by 3 other powers constantly, we lose all of our forces doing so.Forces really want to siege a city in the heart of the enemy's territory on the other side of the map. So they do this, and it causes 1000 problems.Have to do a part of the main quest where nobody from the country knows the location of the guy I have to visit (literally no one, talked to at least 10 people) and I have never seen him once.  So I can't progress in the main quest at all which I need to do.  Amazing.Somehow 150 troops are faster than my army with only food supplies and half cavalry units.  What the hell.Tons of other problems like these can be avoided by playing native/modded Mount and Blade Warband.  Seriously, don't buy this if you value your time at all.  If you want firearms just buy the Napoleonic Wars DLC for Mount and Blade Warband (multiplayer only).			"

												As a lover of the other Mount & Blade games, I came in with fairly high expectations and a want to love this game. And I really tried to, but after just 3 hours I realised something.This game is just nowhere near as fun as Warband, or even the original M&B.Perhaps this is unfair, due to my love of a medival environment, and I can't quite put my finger on what I dislike so much; perhaps it's the less interesting units or the changes to certain gameplay aspects such as mercenaries which overall just made the game far less fun for me. All in all, for other lovers of the M&B franchise, I'm afraid I cannot recommend buying this. It's far from being a bad game, but I simply didn't enjoy it. Perhaps worth a buy if on a decent sale.

Yes it has a different setting and adds a nice, punchy feel to the firearms, but the lazy designed world-map, the uninspired factions and puny equipment-pool makes this hardly worth any money. Get Warband and install some nice mods fitting the time period.Another scam standing in line with ""Carribean!"" and ""Viking Conquest"", ready to receive pike and shot from an angry mob of customers.

Shure it has just a small MP-Community but exactly that is the cool thing about it. Everybody knows everyone and if you are good you can make a name of yourself! There are also often disputes between some clans especially the german and the polish part of this game are hating each other sometimes. But what is a wargame without war? Yes NOTHING!Some more pros for Wfas:- can be also played on ""Bamboo-PC's""- easy to learn and if you are good in other MB-Games u are also good here- not as much ""little kids"" than in other games- little price for a game u can play more than 1000 hours without getting bored- nice clans with nice leaderships and (mostly) friendly players- has also a nice singleplayer campaign if u play it long enough- ...GG WP to all nabs who red this:*			"

												The game is quite fun but the glitches can drive you to an insane assylum, like hiring musketeers or pikemen and your character calling them ""swordsmen"". ""For a good swordsmen I am happy to pay (money amount)"" or something like that. You could be hiring farmers from an in to turn into soldiers cheaply and you still say that;Every. Damn. Time.The combat itself is fun but the horse archery is nearly impossible unlike Mount and Blade Warband where it is easy to master. Using bows in this game is rediculously hard and the arrows tend to not go where you want them to.""Hey look at me I am aiming at this guy's chest and hit the ground 3 feet away!!! YAAAY!!!""""Like I said, quite irritating.If you can get past the glitches and bugs that will never be fixed and the horrible archery you can have a lot of fun time with this game. The multiplayer is solid but there are not nearly as many user made maps, if any like in Warband.			"

												You wonder: What is this? With fire and sword? The name sounds off tasks of Warband but this... This is warband in the 17th CENTURY! What I nicknamed this was the 3 musketears of Mount and blade because... Its just so simliar to the 3 musketears and you meet a guy from France! I really did like the beggining where you steal a horse (Unlike warband) and ride off like your some sorta gangsters and run into some, Police. But overall there is a fun invasion type where you buy troops (In mp) and then deffend against a entire army of troops! Sadly but surely there is only 1 mod. But the good news is the mod is a Zombie mod? Unlike warband all the zombie mods died! Enjoy this and I hope you get the, Zombie mod for this. Enjoy this!!!			"

												Mount And Blade: With Fire & SwordI remember i had just still only known the M&B series for such little time, yet after playing Warband. I had to keep going and surely With Fire & Sword kept me at the edge of my seat taking up hour by hour as i couldn't be contained from this outstanding expansion to this godlike franchise.A truely amazing experience i've had with this game for only three days.This expansion or stand-alone DLC for Mount And Blade: Warband (Another great piece to buy) is a definite must have for any PC gamer. Taking place in 17th Century Europe, firearms and explosives have now been introduced causing much more of a threat in casualties. As well as five nations ranging from the Polish, Swedes, Ukranian, Russian and Arabian decent are in constant war with each other. Whilst you, a wandering mercenary must find your calling to either work for these factions and conquer all of Eastern Europe. Or manage to raise an army of young recruits and mercenaries to be a lone wolf and conquer all of Europe yourself.There is also a story for the Poles, Ukranians and Russians in case you want to play in a more linear fashion.Other than that, combat still feels fantastic aside from the old 17th century firearms being able to one shot both you and the AI,  but thats just really my only downside to this game.Realistic, fun, and endlessly entertaining. I recommend Mount And Blade: With Fire & Sword to either veterans of the M&B series or maybe those who wish to start off their long and exciting journey into this series. But be advised, if you are a first timer to this series and buy this, just note the start in this game is far more complex than the start in Warband.Yet at the same time, both Warband and With Fire & Sword are honestly worth the cheap price it asks.

												While being a very anticipated game for me and many others, I was very underwhelmed by the work put into this game. While many others did enjoy this game, with right reasoning too, I personally enjoy the other two predeseres to the mount and blade franchise. Let me tell you why. I have seen plenty of mods for mount and blade warband and they have been pretty good. In fact I would go as far as to say some of them are up to par or even better than what with fire and sword has to offer, a ten dollar game mind you, as where the mods were completely free (Minus the game). This game really brought me down and thought the mount and blade series was slowing and going down, but news of a sequal to warband has got my hopes up for the franchise again. Now let me tell you why I prefer warband to this. In this game you dont recruit people from villages anymore, a perfectly fine mechanic they threw that out the window to make it where you have to get people from the merc. camp in the faction. Now this is kinda a load of bull because they cost way too much and also are not very good in combat, the unit upgrade system was funky and when the game was released you could not even upgrade your troops to begin with. The interface and combat seems clunky, the weapons are very unrealisic, and the quests I just dont like in my opinion. Overall rating for this game? 4/10 could be better.			"

												(review of a game previously purchased and played)Mount and Blade: With Fire and SwordYour probably thinking ""I Loved Mount and Blade:Warband .... but now with muskets Awesome!!""  well no, not so much.M&B:Warband was this series crown jewel... Fire and sword is this series ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stepchild.  It feels gimicky, and ruins gameplay that was/is uniquly Mount and Blade.If you want some Mount and blade style gameplay but with muskets buy the DLC for warband called ""Napoleanic Wars"" its amazing and does correctly what Fire and Sword does not.Fans of the series should avoid this title and it pains me to say that as ive supported this developer since i first heard of the Orgional Mount and Blade and bought it to support a new indie dev.  (single guy makes a game... compelling story)  But hes not indie anymore and this title prooves that.Overall id give this title a5/10 (because it doesnt do anything good, and is worse then previous titles)			"

												I have to ask if this was an actual expansion made by those who made M&B Warband..or if this is another glorified Mod like Vikings that got pushed onto steam. If the latter, then it would explain so much.This game has lots of good improvements and additions, yet it just falls so very short. With a game more focused on caravans, less chances for actual combat (In Warband, you could hunt down brigands and such in the early parts. Here, you don't really get so many to hunt down), and a strange voice focus on always saying ""With Fire & Sword!"".This doesn't feel like Warband. It just feels so off and strangely..boring. You have less fighting, and more running around to find who sells salt or the frustrating quest of what Bishop wrote what on what cannons to use as some passcode. The nations/powers don't have the same 'personality' and feel as Swadia & Company.Honestly? Don't buy this. If you want guns THAT badly, find a mod. Any mod that puts them in. But this mod is not worth 10 bucks. Get it under 2-3 dollars if you really *MUST* have it, but Warband is much more fun than this.			"

												I want to like this game, I really do. But the combat feels so... Unfair, and short. Having played Warband for many hours, this game just didn't feel the same, and mods reflect a general dislike of this game. Something about it makes it feel shorter, and clunkier. This is a game that in my eyes just didn't live up to my expectations. If you want a more balanced combat system, with each class having advantages and disadvantages, then go to Mount and Blade Warband. If you want quick, ranged battles with the battles being dominated primarily by musketmen, then this is the game. If you want a gunpowder multiplayer experience, Mount and Blade Napoleon.			"

												Guns = cool, everything else = not as good as warband.EDIT: Heres some more about why I dislike it.To me Fire and Sword just has much less character and charm to it. In Warband I often struggled to gain a large army and to maintain it I enjoyed interactions with the characters, e.t.c, but in FaS I didnt care about the quests the lords gave, the lords/kings, or really anything else. There are also odd choices such as you cant recruit from towns at a certain point, and more. I recomend buying Viking Reforged instead of Fire and Sword, and looking into reviews that competent people have written.			"

												     Caravan Simulator 2015 Is this game.This game adds and takes away a lot from the great M&B Warband.     What it gives?---------------------Caravans-New Map-Ordering Custom Gear (armor/weapons)-Firearms-Main Storylines-New Factions-Cool custom mercs-Banks-------------------     Now what it takes away--------------------Marriage-Tournaments-The usefulness of hiring village volunteers-Crossbows-The Sense of being a hero in a battle-The fun of being able to simply join a faction and get land then break off and be your own nation------------------     I personally find this game pretty fun, but i dislike what they removed mostly. I enjoyed courting my future wife and i enjoyed joining a tournament. I also miss being able to take on 10 guys by myself easy as pie. With the presence of firearms, you WILL die in 1-2 bullets, unless you leave your damage taken at 1/4 (Easiest) Getting fiefs is now a HUGE chore! Want to get your nice personal custom musket? it costs over 100k thaler.. How do you get 100k thaler? There are ways of getting cash, but it still takes quite a long time, I have done about 30 hours of JUST trying to make cash, and in that time i have the best gear OUTSIDE of custom gear. Now banks are useful, but there slow, want to raid a village? cool you get about 1-2k and that faction will hate you and hunt you down DEAD. I do enjoy this but if your a achievement hunter this game will literally take you over 100 hours to finish 1 storyline, unless you cheat but then you dont get that cheevo. The presence of being able to hire top tier soldiers is nice, but you have to wait a few in game days. There is ALOT that just makes this game slow..very very slow, if you are willing to put ALOT of hours into this go ahead. It is not as fun as Warband was, not even close, and I would recommend getting a mod called ""mount and gun"" before this game, i got it on sale for 2$ which is definitely worth it, but i would wait for a sale to get this, it is not worth full price.      Good luck and enjoy! "

												This game constantly feels like there is things missing it it, the Mount & Blade series and every game in its series is based more towards modding and modding is what makes the game; thus saying this, the modding section of this game is pretty low in the section of mods you can get compared to Mount & Blade Warband which is the game that takes home the golden trophy when it comes to this series. Mount & Blade Warband also has a pretty decent vanilla game compared to this game, as this game constantly feels like its missing features as stated before.There is one thing I do like about this game and that's the ability of fire arms in the vanilla game (which there are mods for fire arms in Warband) and the ability to mass recruit soldiers at low costs, other than that I don't really care for the game.If you love Warband you may want to try this game but just know this game is lacking more so in the content department than Warband is and mods are what make up Warband and this game doesn't nearly have the wide variety of mods as Warband has.It's a good game, don't get me wrong but it's just lacking with content and the world feels more empty than Warband and the lack of mods and vanilla features that were in Warband makes me give this game a thumbs down.

												There is no reason to get this game when there are so many mods for Warband. Some have all the features of Fire and Sword, such as different grades of food and gun warfare. The game lakes quite a bit of polish, even compared to the original Moun and Blade. The gameplay is ruined for me by the fact that for whatever reason, I can't recruit troops from villages. I'm not sure if this is a glitch or a gameplay mechanic, but it ruins the flow of the game because it makes getting high tiered troops impossilbe. If your looking for a fun game in the Mount and Blade series, just stick with Warband or wait for the devs' sequel.			"

												Basicly, its like warband but with guns instead of crossbows. Its cool giving an order and watching rows of your men fire their rifles all at the same time, and seeing a large clump of enemies just fall. But overall, it feels like a good mod rather than a full game. Im sure if you looked into it, you could find a mod similar to this for warband. Unfortunately, this game doesn't really have a modding community to redeem it (Most mods are just ports from warband, and there arent many big original mods).			"

												Bought this because I'm such a fan of Warband.Was disappointed.The map is more alive, but I find that it has far less atmosphere. The cities feel empty and I find them impossible to defend. The artstyle is also a little less atmospheric than Warband, and with it's graphics as it is in this day and age, you really need atmosphere. The guns are as OP as they were in those times, but for a game like this you often just get shot off your horse by some peasant and that's it. Your battle is over. Realistic? Yes. Fun? Nope. Not time after time.I found it hard to immerse and in the end I ended up just burning out. I tried to like it, but failed. 72,5hrs of play and my conclusion is that I should stick with Warband.			"

												I can't stand this game. With as great as the first Mount and Blade was, you'd think the sequels could only be better. You'd be wrong. The sword controls are completely broken, making it all but impossible to actually swing your weapon in the manner you wish instead of flailing around like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fish out of water. The enemy coding remains just as horrible, however, meaning that once you've flailed yourself into a defeat, if you manage to miraculously get away you can expect the exact same enemy party that just beat you to immediately chase you down again, just to watch you Kermit the Frog your arms around until they beat you again. And again. And again. Unplayable. They should've stuck to updating the original instead of wasting time on this piece of crap ""upgrade"".			"

												The developers abandoned this game and left it in a bad shape. The game has a small player base and a lot of major storyline-breaking bugs, it's still playable though.LIETUVIAMS Šį žaidimą kūrė lenkų kompanija. Nors žaidime yra lietuviškų elementų, kai kur tekstuose ATR vadinama Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, bet iš pradžių šalį vadino Polish Republic, vėliau kai bandžiau ginčyti pavadinimą, pakeitė į Polish Commonwealth, tačiau ignoravo prašymus įtraukti Lietuvos vardą.

												Heyyo, another game in the Mount and Blade franchise... not as good as the first one, but maybe on par or a little worse than Warband, it's still a good game. For multiplayer? I wouldn't bother with this game as Taleworlds now has that viking game out which is Multiplayer only... I dunno, I might not bother with that one since I really enjoy the singleplayer of the Mount and Blade series.			"

												Can't recommend this when Warband exists.The art feels very off, and the core gameplay isn't as fun in my opinion.With warband, you have plenty of mods to spice it up if the base game gets stale. With this, there are very few mods.Maybe get it if you love Warband and are willing to pay for a campaign with a historical setting, rather than just go for mods.The multiplayer is basically dead, but captain co-op is a neat addition if you can actually find a game.

I love this game, but when companies put the screws to there customers, i really have to say NO NO NO thats unacceptable. hence i will have to give this game a thumbs down, even though initially it is a thumbs up.If you buy this game, you will likely love it for a while, then grow into a silent rage when you realize its an aborted game that didn't get enough development time.

												If you are considering getting this game, DON'T. I pre-ordered it with high hopes from  the creators of Mount & Blade/Warband but unless you did heavy research, you'll learn the hard way Fire and Sword is basically a older version of Mount & Blade that was geared towards the European audience just repackaged and released upon the masses at retail price. ($30)When compared to it's ""older"" predeccesors it falls flat on it's face in every single way possible. The addition of firearms isn't nearly enough to make up for the short-comings. You could easily just get a mod for Warband to just add firearms. The character models look like they took the original Mount & Blade's models and just wiped their♥♥♥♥♥with it. The dev team has not done nearly enough to breathe life into this because in my opinion nearly EVERY faction is the ♥♥♥♥ing same. The only way I can diffrenciate them is ""mongols, other guys with horses, Swedish, everyone else"" the 'unique' units are a joke. The AI is lacking. Marriage? Gone. Companions are generic as hell, certainly no Nizar. I had to FORCE myself to play this game in order to validate my mistake of paying for this game. While they were trying to make it historical, Eastern Europe was not the greatest place to do it so I give them credit for working with what they had. There are not many mods for this game either because what's the point? the Trade missions are a DRAG, villiager missions can go to hell, in fact I can say every mission with MAYBE the main questlines are BORING and REPITITVE and POINTLESS. There is nothing redeeming about this game.RATING:3/10 (a BAD game)The only mistake the devs made was releasing this AFTER Mount & Blade/Warband. This should've been the first game in the series. The M&B games after this would've been hailed as the greatest ♥♥♥♥ing improvement ever. If they were on such a money-grubbing mission they could've at least improved the graphics, AI, EVERYTHING before releasing it. Not even can be called a reskin of Warband because its INFERIOR to Warband. Looking at this game makes me ill.			"

												Mount & Blade: Fire and Sword is the third game from the game series of Mount & Blade. A sandbox game that takes players to control a character in an open world map with multiple  major and minor factions.Those who have played the previous/other games from the same series will know exactly what I am talking. If not, take a look at my Review related to M&B: Warband for a complete knowledge of what the series and its games are about: http://steamcommunity.com/id/TakedaYabu/recommended/So, I’ll begin my review by writing about the bad aspects of the game which are many...No character background story:That lack of such feature before your adventure can even begin, gives you the feeling that you will be playing with a completely random character. Unlike of what happens to all the other previous games in the series, Fire and Sword does not have a custom character background history.Same engine and mechanics as in the previous game, Warband:There is absolutely nothing new in Fire and sword that wasn’t been already seen and experienced in M&B: Warband. From the graphics and textures, what changes are that only muskets and matchlock pistols were added as a main weapon in the field of battle.In few words, this game feels like an average community made mod/expansion, and not an actual game produced from a company who managed just before, to release the best game from its series that defined the whole concept of what a true sandbox game should be.Even more bugs and errors:Despite Warband having some issues with some insignificant bugs and errors that could be easily fixed most of the times, in Fire and Sword, not just it has the same bugs and errors but also other more bugs when you wish to do an action, but also in the quests themselves that can ruin your entire gameplay if you are unlucky enough not to create a save file before you accept that quest.Boring and repetitive:Even when both games follow the same concept of sandbox with a very similar if not the same gameplay style, the way the campaign map is designed being only made of grassland and more grassland instead of the 4 elements seen in Warband, such as the Desert, Snow, Grassland and Montains.Unbalanced game:Despite being interesting at the beginning, once you have invested some time in the game and in your campaign progress, you will realize that the game ends up by making you looting villages, sell items, hire troops and fight.The players routine in the game to achieve success and power is a never ending repetitive loop.Now to the good aspectsMusic:The music in this game is wonderful I must admit, to hear the piano and the violin while you shoot and slain people is very pleasing and mixes perfectly with the time period where the game is based on.The age of gunpowder:The addition of firearms and armies based on it in a Mount & Blade game is unique and indeed a surprise to players who enjoy shooting and slashing down opponents!ConclusionI would rate this game a 20 out of 100 or a 1,0 out of 5,0 stars. The same exact graphics and game mechanics as in Warband in a game that could easily contain success, but failed miserably... a huge disappointment.			"

												Well, it's not that bad. Probably can be fun for some. But overall, I consider it to be awful. I played only 3 hours, because of the early game. And here's the main reason: It's hard. You can put difficulty on easy and lower all options until you get ""14% difficulty"", but you're still going to be killed by villagers. The issue? You aren't fighting farmers, you're fighting the same soldiers you'd recruit. So, yes: 50+ units of the same level of the early game units. You might reply saying that you won't pillage villages soon. Well, wrong. The questline forces you to raid not one but three villages, a task that apparently may only be done with 15 mercs (and I repeat, easy difficulty with 14% difficulty in the options). Of which atleast 10 will die because there are musket militia, and your ""riflemen"" mercs have bows. Have fun.			"

												I bought with fire and sword probably a year or more after it came out because I had  finally purged enough salt from Mount&blade and Mount&blade warband not feeling finished. I was able to buy this on sale for like 1.99 or something.I regret the time I spent installing it. It's a partially reskinned Mount&Blade Warband with guns, but somehow it manages to lack the appeal of its predecessor. I didn't play long enough to really pick up on the nuances of why, but I didn't care to. Uninstalled it as soon as I finished my first session. Probably will reinstall Mount&Blade warband though!

												While another good game in the series, I do find the addition of guns really takes away from this game, Especially with how your AI work compared to how the enemies works. I find more often then not battles start up, And the AI mows down half your team with a wave of musket shots which seem lazer guided. I would Strongly suggest the others in the series.			"

												At first... I was like ""Oh, sweet, a Mount & Blade set during the Deluge!  This sounds really interesting!""  It sounds interesting.  Sounds.I enjoyed Mount & Blade a lot, and I was expecting it to work as sort of an expansion pack similar to most mods or the Napoleonic Wars add on.  However, it turned out to be a stand alone game.Whatever, I can dig it.  I'll just start a new single player campaign.It promptly asks you what difficulty and gender, and immediately after... skips the background and goes directly to the stats screen.  It was unusual, but I figured maybe it was after this part.  I enjoyed having a background for each character, afterall.  Added to the immersion, afterall.What a backstory for your character?  You won't get one here.Alright, that's fine, I can still hang in.  Now, where do I spawn first?  I think Sweden would be fun.Nope, can't do that either.  You begin with a tutorial.  A tutorial.  It leads to your first quest which is fight a gang of bandits and hlp three guys you don't know out of a sticky situation.  Or something, not really sure.  I stopped caring when I realize they just drop you into the action with little motive or reasoning.Well, that was a rough start...  Still, its set during the deluge.  I wonder what weapons you can get.I turn cheatmenu on to see the item list... and it was removed.WELL, that sucked!  Whats the purpose of removing a cheat option?  To balance a game that's already been cheated?Whatever, I'm sick of campaign already.  Time to check out the custom battle!I set up a siege between Sweden and Poland, I'm fighting for the Swedes as a nameless Scottish Halberdier.  Whatever, I get to hit someone with a halberd and I like it.  ^^The battle starts off like most Mount and Blade battles, so no real difference there.  The moment I die, the battle ends...  Which is strange.  Yes, I know Mount and Blade tends to end battles when you die, but with all the mods that continue the battles... you'd think they'd take a cue from the community.  I mean, Napoleonic Wars began as a mod.  And now its like $10 on steam.Whatever, I'll just host a mulitplayer match and turn a password on so the battle continues.  Siege again... and I forget the AI is stupid in Multiplayer.  Something they won't ever fix...  Not like they can just take the NPCs from the Singleplayer game and use them instead of the bots, but whatever.  I'll just take a moment to check out the armor and weapons we can get for each faction and each unit.The stuff you get are just as bad, apparently.  ""Its realistic, though!""  Realism would mean they didn't call Russian Musketeers 'Riflemen'.Whatever...  If you want some deluge action in Mount and Blade Warband, save yourself the money and find a mod on the forums.  I'm sure there is something that is just as good, if not better.  Overall, I don't think this game would be a good buy for your library.			"

												This game walks the fine line between ""It should have been a dlc"" and ""It was too big for a dlc"" I tend to believe in the first option but it doesn't mean I don't consider the second. If you want to see the evolution of sword combat into pike and shot then download mods like Sayazn or Nova Aetas for mount and blade warband. If you want to play in western russia then good for you.

												Can somebody say ""frustrating?""  This game is relentless to newcomers and vets alike.  If not for the guns, Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword would be just Mount and Blade, but it would also be exponentially better.  From the begginning of the game to the pinnacle of your rule, guns remain the height of your fear.  Just a single bullet can put a player down in a battle, leaving the rest of the fighting to the exceptionally stupid AI who always seem to lose if they're on your side.  Simple occurrences like that can set a player back hours, and this happens over and over again.  This is a game Macklemore would turn down, even if it was just 99 cents.			"

												Its far from as good as Mount & Blade warband.What i felt most disapointing was the singleplay. Sure it has some new mechanics but i didnt find them any good or fun.Also you don't get those epic and fun fights like you do in warband. Becuse you spend most of the fights hiding behind a rock, tree or your soldiers so you wont get one shot by some random rifleman 100m away.The rifle combat is so awful. The rifles are very strong so you can often get suprised killed by anyone. Useing a rifle yourself is even worse since the bullet can fly anywere. So shooting becomes more of luck then a skill. With the high relode time just makes it worse. If you want to fight with rifles in a mount and blade game i recomend the napolic dlc for warband. Becuse the rifles are more accurate so its more skill based, It feels more epic with music and cannons, I think relode is faster or atlest it feels faster. I only got the hours on the game becuse the melee combat in multiplayer was the one fun thing.			"

												It's the black sheep of M&B. The addition of firearms to the base game essentially unbalances everything, and being shot anywhere ♥♥♥♥s you up something terrible. This and the period of history it depicts are the only real divisions between it and Warband.However, you probably only own this anyway because you bought the collection, in which case you have Napoleonic Wars which is far better, despite being multiplayer only. Out of all the numerous modules you can get for Warband, Fire & Sword will probably be played the least.			"

												I though this was going to be a good game, better than Warband. Guess what? It wasn't. It's exactly like M&B:W but with a smaller troop recruitment, Want to play as a Warlord that conquers land? Too bad. This game takes away the feel that you can conquer every single village,town,fortress,castle, and Capital. This is a good game overall(Graphics, Storyline ETC.) but the gameplay isn't that good, I though it would be like M&B:W but with cannons. It wasn't.

												With Fire & Sword is a version of the game Mount & Blade, the game that claims to be a mix of a role play game and a wargame. The most obvious changes are the replacement of crossbows with firearms, a new map and the 16th/17th century setting.  This is the time that warfare gradually changed from melee based to firearm based. (A side note: the setting actually mixes  aspects of the 16 century setting with that of the  17th century. The halbediers belong more to the former century and the musketeers/cavalry more to the latter.)There some  other changes. There seem to be more quests and the recruitment system has been overhauled. However, at the core the game is the same and as such has the same problems as the old game, such as a rudimentary battlefield mechanism, a nonexistent storyline,  a simplistic dialogue tree, superficial boring personalities and  tedious repetitive battles of which there are way too many. And these problems are  now compounded by the introduction of firearms.With muskets you can kill an adversary from the other side of the map and what is more.. he can do the same.  In fact the ai is actually better at shooting because it isn't bothered by the fact that from a distance avatars are so small that you can't make them out right. My first half hour was spend being shot to pieces. The only way to escape that fate is by  moving in an unpredictable pattern so the enemy can't take aim properly. In the meantime you either have to try and kill them with your own firearm(while moving about in a random way!) or with your  sidearm. Battles turn therefore into tedious hit and run activities in which standing still is an invite to be killed on the spot.The milita that you can recruit at the start is woefully inept to deal with anything better than looters and once you have enough of them to actually have a chance to win a fight, your army is so slow that you can't catch deserters, brigands and such because they are faster than you. So you either have to fight enemies who are superior to your inept troops.. or hope to corner a band of ruffians,which involves you in chasing them across the map hoping you won't loose sight of them when the night sets in or when they run into a wooded area.In fact the best thing to do is not to recruit any militia or infantry but to go from town to town to find and  hire mercenary cavalry or  heroes so you can overtake your enemies or have a chance to runaway from them when they are too strong.In any event the game seems to promise to become a protracted boring game, like the basic game was, but now you can use firearms and play on a map that represents eastern europe. The game is neither a good role play game nor a good wargame, because it doesn't implement either aspect well and  it amazes me  that people actually consider this game to be good.But I guess tastes differ..

												This 17th-century counterpart to the fun-filled Mount and Blade: Warband was ill-conceived and does not even nearly measure up to its predecessor. Firearm-based warfare simply does not fit into Mount and Blade's combat system, and the result is silly, disjointed battles rife with anachronistically-accurate gunshots. In the period during which this game takes place, one would be lucky to hit a barn at 100 meters with a musket. As such, massed volleys were the order of the day. Not so in this title. Want to hit an enemy from 50 meters with a pistol while riding at full speed on your horse? No problem. And don't be surprised if you get sniped from halfway aross the map under the same circumstance. And it's not just the battles that are bad: the campaign takes a giant step backwards from Warband also, lacking numerous gameplay aspects native to that superior title. Campaign gameplay in With Fire and Sword mainly boils down to running away from bandits and endlessly playing errand boy to local lords, and is both needlessly difficult and extremely tedious.Though this game is sold at a bargain-bin price, it is truly not worth any amount of your money or time. Avoid.			"

												Waaaay too simplistic to recommend.I like some of the ideas but the animation, quest structure and just about everything (except the fun and rewarding progression) is completely under-developed. This feels like an Alpha at best, an unfinished first attempt at a game by some high-schoolers at worst.And to think they have made 3 full retail releases based on this same engine, and are making a M&B 2. The nerve. This is an unfinished game and I have 0 expectations of actual quality and thoughtful game design from this developer going forward.			"

The main questline for certain factions (mainly Muscovite and Polish ) are so glitchy that you have to save every little step you take or else you risk having a gamebreaking glitch where you can't progress.

Mount & Blade is a MiddleAge Game. Here you can play Roleplay in Singleplayer which i really enjoy because there are many ways to play for example you can be a Rebel or you can be a royal Duke and be nice to a King... Many Weapons and many Armors but thats not all! There is a also a really cool Multiplayer, fight against other Players with Sword,Bow,Guns and more. If u like Middle Age Roleplay or Fight, i can really recommend this to you. "

												I thought this game was going to be mount and blade but with guns! It's not that. It sucks♥♥♥♥♥1. The guns are a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.2. The map has to have been downsized by about 3 times.3. No more hiring from villages, you go to merc camps. Yay?4. Raiding cities is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. All of your men die almost instantly. (Even elite units)5. The ""new"" armor and weapons are poorly textured and none of them look cool. 6. Most of the gun models look like rectangles with♥♥♥♥♥♥drawn on them.7.I loved the combat in Mount and Blade warband, but here it is boring.8. The AI of your troops is utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I order my men to hold the position and they either charge or fumble around. And when they do either of those, the enemies are already here, and we're all dead.9.You will not make a big army. Big armies are a ♥♥♥♥ing dream in this game. I went to all the merc camps and cities and only had around 70 men.10.The gun's fire sound effect sucks♥♥♥♥♥ I liked the one in napoleonic wars better.11. The maps are bland and boring.12. What the ♥♥♥♥ is a wagon fort?13. Enemies can hit you from a mile away, but you can barely even see them.14. There's like 20 weapons in this entire game.15. Most of the marketplaces are empty. There's about 5-6 items in each one.16. Almost all of the bandits are on horseback, making it boring to fight them with marksmen.17. You will not have epic shooting battles. You will have the battles where all of your men die and you have to shoot the enemy.18. There is no real improvement. 19. You will not get a boner from the music. The music is not cool.20. The UI sucks my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ juices. It's all white and makes me feel like I'm going blind.21. The factions are boring and you don't really care for them. Sweden? Oh boy, I love that faction! no.22. There are about 3 types of boots in the entire game.23. None of the weapons or armor from the old game are in this game. Therefore, this game is a giant pile of monkey♥♥♥♥♥♥Pros1. Guns are cool.2. Grenades are coolJust kidding both of these suck♥♥♥♥♥♥in this game.			"

												Mount & Blade, Fiery Sword is a terrible, terrible shitpiece of a game. Unlike Skyrim, there are no epic fantasy elements in the land of Firordia, instead, the player travels across boring European landscapes- with no snow. Clearly they do not know that European landscapes are boring without snow which  is why Oblivion was a♥♥♥♥♥♥game. I do not reccommend this game. Even the combat opts too far towards actual swordplay instead of flailing your weapon like Skyrim. Not reccommended.			"

												Thought it was kinda crappy at first, (bought it for $2 on sale) and stopped playing it.Fast forward one year and I discover they actually have frikkin MULTIPLAYER SERVERS where you can play: TDM, FFA, and Battles where you can control platoons of troops ranging from 3-50+ against AI's. (Against other players you get like 3 guys)Great game, maybe not for $10 but if you love M&B  youll like this game.... (Also custom battles like Napoleonic War but with WAAAAY better AI's and sieges and stuff....)█▀▀ㅤ █ ㅤ █ㅤ █ㅤ █ㅤ▀▀█▀▀ㅤㅤ█ㅤ █ㅤ █▀▀▄ 　 ▀▀█ㅤ█▀▀█ㅤ █ㅤ █ㅤ ㅤ █ㅤㅤㅤ █ ㅤ █ㅤ █ ㅤ █ 　 ▀▀▀ㅤ▀ ㅤ▀ㅤ ▀▀▀▀ㅤㅤ ▀ㅤㅤ ㅤ ▀▀▀▀ㅤ █▀▀ 　 ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ▄▀▀▄ㅤ█▀▀▄ㅤ █▀▀▄ ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ█▄▄█ㅤ█ ㅤ █ㅤ█ ㅤ █ ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ█ㅤ █ㅤ█ ㅤ █ㅤ█▄▄▀─────███────██──────████───███────────████──███─────────████─█████████████──██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████─────█████████████████────────██████████──█───────────█████──────────────████──────────────█────────▄███████▄██───███▄▄──▄▄███──────▄██$█████$██▄██──█▀───▀███────█───▄██$█████████$██▄██──█───█──██───█─█──█$█████████████$███──█──────██─────█──███████████████████──██────██▀█───█─────██████████████─█───██████──▀████───────███████████──────────────────█───────█████████─────────────▀▀████──────███████████────────────────█▀──────██───████▀─▀█────────────────▀█──────█─────▀█▀───█──▄▄▄▄▄▄▄────────██────█───████▀───██─█████████████────▀█──█───███▀──▄▄██─█▀██▀██▀████▀█████▀──█───██████▀─▀█─█────────█▄─────────██───████▀───██─██▄████▄──██────────██───██──▄▄▄██──██▄▄▄▄▄██▀─────────██──█████▀───█─────────███────────███████▄────███────────███████─────█████████████───────▄██████████████████████████████─██████████████████─────────██████████████────────███████████───────█████──────████─────████ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ▀▀█▀▀ㅤ█▀▀█ㅤ█ㅤ▄█ㅤ█▀▀ ㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤ ㅤㅤ█ ㅤㅤ█▄▄█ㅤ█▀▀▄ ㅤ█▀▀ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ▀ㅤ ㅤ▀ㅤ ▀ㅤ▀ㅤㅤ▀ㅤ▀▀▀ █▀▄▀█ㅤ█ ㅤ █ㅤ ㅤ█▀▄▀█ ▄▀▀▄ █▀▀▄ █▀▀ █ ㅤ █ㅤ█ █─▀─█ㅤ█▄▄█ㅤㅤ █─▀─█ █ ㅤ █ █ ㅤ █ █▀▀ █▄▄█ㅤ██ㅤㅤ █ㅤ▄▄▄█ㅤ ㅤ█ㅤㅤ█ ─▀▀ ─ ▀ ㅤ ▀ ▀▀▀ ▄▄▄█ㅤ▄  "

												Another great gem of a game for the sandbox lovers, just the right amount of fire power to to make it feel to tacky and the variants of units now is very nice to see can feel a little harder than warband and mount n blade for starting troop trees are the same you have to go to towns and speak to a commander for higher tier troops as villages give you basic miltia.

												Fire and Sword takes place much further along in history than the other Mount and Blade games. The inclusion of flintlock pistols and rifles may not seem like to much, but the game becomes very unbalanced with these new weapons. While trying to fight your way to capture a town, a single stray shot will hit and kill you. Thus the game thinks the battle has ended, but to continue fighting you have to use the automatic fight protocol (which sucks). I realize the developers were trying to modernize the game to include a bit different play style, but the balance is way off to allow for an enjoyable playthrough. Try either the original Mount and Blade or Mount and Blade: Warband if you want that combat oriented conquering goodness of a game. Those two are much better balanced.			"

												Expect to have to play by their rules.  Want to be a troop leader?  Tough.  Every mission is a solo mission or a select few people mission.  With guns now able to two shot you, you might as well give up being anything but a strong warrior.  Yeah, I guess it's a new improved ""difficulty"" by limited your options, but it kills the beauty of sandbox.  Say you need to track down a murderer.  You and your 20 guys go to the town.  Your skinny butt says ""I got this guys"" and 20 minutes later they drag out your bleeding corpse.  Moral of the story, if you like hack and slash games where you play a tank killing everyone, this is your game.  If you want to be a commander from the start, l2p noob or just skip this one.			"

												I love the entire Mount & Blade series, and this one is no different.  While I appreciate the historical element to the gameplay, the inclusion of guns and grenades severaly altered the flow of battle and  strategy.  It also made armor less useful because even a peasant with a gun can do a lot of damage.  All in all I would recommend the game for M&B fans, but would suggest that newcomers to the series first look into Warband, and download ACOK mod set in the Game of Thrones universe (a personal favorite).  If that doesn't suit you, there are many mods out there for all of the games, althoughall of the games may be enjoyed without mods should you desire.  Mods simply add variety and keep the game fresh after you've spent quite a few hours on it.			"

												A unique sandbox experience you won't find in many, or really any other game. Thsi little development house has big ideas and executes them well. The scope of teh game is fantasictic, quests and storylines can be a bit repetitious but that could be fixed with a bigger development team. Hoping for more proceedurally generated content in future versions, the base engine and concepts here are really solid.			"

												Mount & Blade the game is a wonderful creature. I've played many hours in this franchise, throughout several games, and I am nothing short of amazed. The basis for the game is so simple, I often wonder why more developers haven't tried something like this, but then I get knocked off a siege ladder for the second consecutive time by my screaming comrades, and feel like playing Call of Duty 36.This installment is a magnificent addition to the franchise - perhaps less-so on the RTS side of it, but definitely moreso on the combat/castle siege part of it. And that's one of the most beautiful parts to the game: There are many sides to it!Though slightly more limited than some of its predecessors (mods included), WF&S is an explosive entry into an explosive era in our world history: The era of the discovery and hugely widespread use of powder weapons.Being a generally combat-based game, this is the feature which I believe shines the most -- another facet of combat.Firearms bring an entirely new level of gameplay. Crossbows had a similar feel, but the sensation of riding down fleeing cossacks and driving a pistol ball into the small of their backs is hard to replicate without the resounding BOOM of a gun. You can really feel the concussion of many of these weapons. The graphics of them are at some points breathtaking. You trot several yards toward a distant wood-hewn fort, your many ranks of men beside you, having temporarily discarded your horses, and the fog is so thick, you can still barely make out the outline of the structure, though you know you must be close now. Suddenly, cries of germanic slang echo across the misty gully in front of a suddenly evident wooden wall, and more obviously, the gunshots follow, their concussions cutting through the haze like thunderclaps.Watching the blasts of powder-powered weaponry atop the walls of a wooden fort was all I needed to justify my purchase of this game.Then I got pushed off a siege ladder again.

												Metascore is pretty low. This game just suits my fantasy to kill stuff with medieval weapons and at the same time, controlling an army to battle with like 20-30 peeps at the same time? Depending on ur graphics card(i think) you could increase the maximum number of people in the field. Pretty nice game. I find this game better than the Warband, played this game more since soldiers differ from faction to faction. But with the warband as far as i saw they only had their name changed but their stuff are the saaame :C			"

												This game is very very good.  Compared to Warband, it is much easier to die, get captured, etc.  I think this is a good thing.  So many times gamers and critics knock sequels for being a re-skin of the original game.  With Fire & Sword requires a much different tactical approach to both battles and the overworld map.  So if you enjoyed the mechanics of Warband and would like to expand your tactical horizons, With Fire & Sword is for you.			"

												Fun and contains tactical use. Charging someone is not the best idea unless you've enabled easy mode. Like Mount & Blade and Warband, but features gun powder and set of old world weaponry to help you conquer your foes. You've lost the ability to form your 'own' faction (due to being based on a book), but you are able to make peace as rebels (unlike the first M&B). Crossbows are gone. Bows are quick and weak. Guns are slow and powerful. Grenades are awesome power, and Gatling guns don't yet exist. :'(Recommended buy if you enjoyed the previous.			"

												One of the best, the graphics may not look different but the new range of weapons, ability to start a small army and choose sides in an on going slaughter make Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword one of the best in its series. If your not traveling for two days to get to some hovel filled village on the brink of starvation, or talking to the mayor of Warsaw for a job you could be killing some Swiss deserters or tarnsporting goods to make a 100s of Thalers. The joy of slashing the head off a  bandit while speeding on horseback, firing a musket shot straight through the head of a Polish Hussar from attop a hill or wildly slashing in close quarters combat. The combat controls are not too different from any other PC game, blocking is vital and I would say playing the tutorial is very useful. In one paragraph I couldn't sum up what you can do to get money, gain reputation and level up. Sending caravans is risky, you must spend hundreds on what to send where this also includes prices for guards and other things. Most of the time you get some money and make a profit, however, the other times you are left penniless because your caravan 'was attacked' and there is nothing you can do, a very quick way to be sent into manic depression. Obviously you can do missions to heavy your purse as well as boost rep amongst the faction who gave you the task. Occasionally you are given...lets call it preporation cash, this amount is so you can get some weapons, perhaps hire some help and to act as an insentive so you get on with it! However, don't spend it all in one place! With these new found riches you automatically go to the arms merchant to the coolest looking sword or to the Armour merchent to get that ""Uber awesome lookin' helmet!"" I will tell you now if you lose that battle, you will be marched miles away from where you need to be, then left with no sword, or helmet, scrap of meat or coin to your name so spend wisely! Hiring men, it's cheap depending on what they can do, so hiring 50 scythe wielding peasants to unquestionably attack 20 calvarymen in droves only to kill half, get massacred, and leave you to take out the rest is insanely useful! However the cost will rank up on their skill, and on that note, we move to ranking up. It's not too complicated and is very useful in making sure your men don't all die. Again keep in mind cost so don't think it necessary to always be a force for good. Think of it as borrowing, a late birthday gift or anything else that isn't stealing. Caravans travel all across the land, loaded with goods, ripe for the picking. However, the Caravans are not without protection, guards may be travaling with it making it seem alot less worth it. However, with your strong army you can do as you please, if you can ransack villages(which you can) then you can take on a caravan! Factions, factions everywhere! Though you don't need to keep them all happy it doesn't hurt to try. But picking sides in a battle can have some very good results...if you win. Doing tasks for your faction can help alot in making you richer and them stronger, however, this war is alot like a boxing match, cheer for the bigger guy. Though there are not many factions here's the list:-The Kingdom of Sweden-Cossack Hetmanate-Polish Commonwealth-Muscovite Tsardom-Crimean Khanate-And, your own.W-w-what? M-m-mine? Yes yours, there are several ways to crush the others and plant your banner into the soil. You can join a faction, then split by capturing towns and denouncing your loyalty. And, after that convince the other lords and ladies to join you! What's stopping you?To conclude, Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword is the best in the series, with good multiplayer, leveling up, combat and story, it's a breath of fresh air for the fans. Though it may lack in some graphical areas it makes up with gameplay and pure brilliance in campaign and other new features. This game may not be enjoyed by impatient gamers but is great if you like not knowing when your going to be attacked, whether your caravan will make it or whether your troops will die. As I said at the start, Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword is fantastic.			"

												If you're considering buying this game, I would recommend purchasing Mount and Blade: Warband first. Fire and Sword pales in comparison. It has a drab and boring overland map, repetitive scenes, only semi-original factions, and the most annoying tutorial in the history of everything. Fire and Sword does bring a few new concepts to the Mount and Blade table however. It offers massed firearm combat along with swords, pikes, bows, etc. It also offers a few ""campaign quests"" which are simply longer than normal quests with fancy names. There are plenty of mods for Mount and Blade: Warband that offers just as much as this game does. Which isn't much.6.5/10			"

												An interesting if somewhat poorly handled official mod, With Fire & Sword is actually Mount & Blade's official release in Poland, pretty much setting up history from the 16th century or so as a framing device. One thing that becomes immediately clearis that this version of Mount & Blade is MUCH harder than its previous incarnations. This can be summed up in three simple reasons: poorer economy, less effective armor, and GUNS. The regional economy is falling on hard times and defeating even bandit infantry is much more difficult than is thanks to the fact that much of your armor is cloth and even low level enemies will carry rifles. Soloing is nearly impossible, so you will have to amass an army one way or another soon. If you're the kind of person who likes to just roam the map being a lone wolf, this is not the game for you, but if you enjoy building up a (surprisingly historically accurate) army and inflicting it on your fellow man, give With Fire & Sword a shot. (Ba dum tish.)			"

												If you've never played this game before, you're really missing out! Like the entire Mount and Blade series, With Fire and Sword blends 1st-person fighting with Real-Time-Strategy and battlefield tactics harmoniously. With entertaining gameplay and well-written stories, M&B:WFS is easily one of my favorite games. Roleplaying is enjoyable and fulfilling, and you'll never run out of ways to fight. Truly a wonderful experience for all!			"

												Let me be clear: This game had many issues at launch, and some are still being ironed out... But it's a completely awesome game to compliment my favorite game from 2010, Warband. I love the map, the settings, and the campaign. The MP has some issues with Battle, but I never bought this for MP - the COOP is where it's at if you're looking to play with friends. Again, nothing about this game is perfect, and it's hardly for everyone - but I love how open it is. It's almost like ""create your own story.""			"

												Ugh, I hate to♥♥♥♥♥♥on this game simply because I love the hell out of M&B: Warband. However, I don't like this game very much. I would say I hate it, but it's not a bad game per se. Let me explain:The AI is incredibly ♥♥♥♥ing lucky. You could be level 30, in the best armor possible, riding the best horse possible, across the entire battlefield, behind trees, over a hill and a town militia will kill you with 1 lucky headshot. Then you lose the battle because your troops go full retard when you die. Also, the mapppp....the Mappppp (da plane, da plane!) Who the hell made this map? The zoomed out view looks like it was done it MS Paint at the last minute. If you haven't seen it, it is basically 1 huge flat area with an ocean to the side of it. It's just insanely huge and flat. There are WAY too many towns and cities. There are just a lot of little things about the game that drive me insane. I wish I could like it. I really do. Guns + Swords + M&B creators = Good game, right? Nope.Sorry M&B. I ♥♥♥♥ing love Warband, I seriously applaud you for that game, but I just cannot play With fire and sword. I give it a 3/10.			"

												Not as fun as it's predecessors. You cannot recruit villagers from towns around the map. Spy missions are completely broken, no minimap and you supposed to find 1 exact person in a huge town with no horse. It's like playing GTA without a minimap or a car and your supposed to find someone in the entire map. You can get killed by 4 gun shot wounds. Armor is very very useless. +1 defence instead of +6 like warband.			"

												It was a late night in Bread Village we had been sieged for over 10 days with continuously attacks, the men was starting to get tired and our morale was getting low. Then on the 11th day me and my men attacked the enemies base with great success but worse thing happend meanwhile, when we started to march home again you could hear the agonisingly screams from afar from the village where we lived. When we enterd the village you could se corpses lying on the ground for some reason it was only villagers from our village. We asked one of the survivors that was badly hurt and lying on the ground what had happend when we where gone, the only thing he said was ""HAIL THE BREAD!"" continuously while shaking. As he would said nothing more we want deeper into the village at the main hall where most of the survivor where they all stared at us and chanted ""The Bread"". A feel of dread slowly creeps over me. One of the survivors is my best commander and I ask him what the hell is going on. He then slowly starts walking towards me, and i notice that all other survivors are doing the same. I notice that they are all completely naked and they are all covered in flour and some of them have burnmarks on their skin. Their chants increase,""THE BREAD, THE BREAD!"". I saw that in their hands they are holding big white bread loafs, and slowly one step at the time they are coming closer and my commander is holding a huge sack of flour. I start yelling ""WHATS HAPPENING"" but no answers are given, i cant find and escape they have surrounded me and are continuously chanting ""THE BREAD!"". They are so close to me i can smell the delicious bread. They suddenly stopped when they where one meter from me their chanting was starting to fade away. One of them said ""What bussnies do you have with the holy bread?"" i answered ""what BREAD?!"". The moment i said that they started furiously chanting ""THE BREAD!"" one of then hit me with the bread in my face. Then the chanting faded again. One of them said ""The Bread is all that is holy and sacred do you offer your life for the Bread and is willing to sacrifise every thing for it. I think to myself what is this madness about this bread? the whole village has lost its mind. I screamd you are all INSANE! Then everything got dark...Based on an ingame experience10/10			"

												This is kind of a review for all the M&Bs. I love these games. The freedom to do so much, attack anyone, raid/pillage villages, rule over kingdoms is exciting. It does have A LOT of grinding, especially early on. I have found that taking a break from quests, I'll do some trading runs for a couple hours, then jump back into the questing. The battles are amazing. Going into battle and leading 100+ troops is exciting and very nervewracking at the same time. I definitely recommend these games if you're into simple free-form RPGs and have a desire to rule over kingdoms (or destroy them!)			"

												I've always been in the ""Graphics don't make a game"" camp and I can safely say this is true in this case. You won't play any of the Mount & Blade titles for the graphics. I think what grabs my attention most about the game is the longevity, playability and sandbox feel to the game. There is freedom in the game to a certain extent. It's like Freelancer but with horses and hatchets. I am really enjoying with Fire & Sword as you have the Musketeer and Swashbuckling era of history. Shooting a Slav Brigand from his horse with your flintlock musket as he charges your lines of musketeers is very satisfying!			"

												I was so disapointed in this game, and I thought they could top Warband. Nope, they changed so much from the other games but they didn't improve anything, they just add things and took out others, but they somehow ruined this game by making it too diffrent from Warband.

												Excellent game, expansion of Mount & Blade: Warband that includes guns, grenades, and more. If you haven't played Mount & Blade: Warband yet, I highly suggest you go there first. This game serves more as an expansion on Warband.Pros: interesting and indepth war based in central and eastern europe, at the outbreak of gunpowder warfare. Firearms add a new depth to battle situations, and allow for more strategy when controlling your units. Seige mechanics have been greatly improved (mostly in the fact that not everyone is trying to cram themselves onto ONE ladder to seige the castle), including more diverse town and fortress layouts. Multiplayer is improved again with better seige battles, and the popular survival-squad type game mode.Cons: Does take a while to get going and have a decent sized army. Certain units are greatly overpowered (looking at you Swedish Reiters). Unable to buy stores and businesses in this version, and weapon diversity is down from the last game.Overall, excellent niche game for those who have played games such as Total War or Age of Empires, and have wanted to experience personal action on the battlefield, or if you like Chivalry, try your hand at commanding your forces.

												Alright, this is...well nothing compared to Warband. But however it is still good, it has limited options though. The scenery is nice, and such, political aspects aswell, but alot of the options in warband are eliminated. Marriage is, so are founding your own factions, etc. The game itself is good, but napoleonic wars is extremely better. The formations and such are great, battles are good, but combat with guns is the only good thing to this game really. I like the special quests, but I struggle to find them past ""satisifactory"" level. Mount and blade is supposed to be BETTER than this. It's still good, and I recommend it, but it lacks any depth compared to Warband. Just get Napoleonic wars for multiplayer, but this right here is a worse version of NW for singleplayer. But it's still a 7.2/10. Get it by all means, it's good.GET A BETTER INTERNET CONNECTION RUBBERBANDING NOOB			"

												This game is fantastic, with a lot of cool things, how you can destroy the story you created by 1 click. It is amazing. The mechanic of the battle is awesome. I love the gigantic♥♥♥♥♥battles of 400 (enemy army) vs 100 (your army) and at the end, you win because you have better equipment. This is what RPG means. Creating your own everything: your own character, your own equipment, your own army, etc. This is definitely one of the best RPGs out there, that isn't very well known. And, I have to say that this is better than Warband. Yes, i said it. Don't buy Warband, buy this. This is 100 times better than Warband. And yes, i played Warband. I don't say that Warband is not a good game. It is a good game, but, With Fire & Sword is a lot better.This game deserves a 9/10. You should buy it right now.			"

This game is cheep defiantly worth it and by the way the graphics are slightly better enjoy XD			"

(Against other players you get like 3 guys)Great game, maybe not for $10 but if you love M&B  youll like this game....

												Take what you know about Mount and Blade: Warband, add in Eastern European Historical Drama, and muskets. That's Fire and Sword for you. The presence of a larger over-arching narrative with different faction based endings is a nice differentiation from Warband, as are the more varied types of armors and visual styles of the armors. My only gripe would be the double edged sword that is the existence of guns. While they add a whole new game facet and unit type into the combat, it can seem a bit cheap at times when you're one or two shotted from half-way across the battlefield in a musket volley. Flanking...flanking everywhere.			"

												A huge disapointment. Paid $15 for this and I feel ripped off. This is essentially just a mod for Warband, like all the dozens of mods made for Warband (all of which are FREE.) Map is bland and boring, devoid of any work or effort, the factions are really hard to distinguish from each other, obtaining new soldiers is a joke and while there are new weapons, such as muskets and pistols, you could have easily downloaded a free mod for the same experience. 4/10 Wish I never bought it, I had more fun with the free TF2 items that can with this game if you preordered.

												If you're considering buying this game, I would recommend purchasing Mount and Blade: Warband first. Fire and Sword pales in comparison. It has a drab and boring overland map, repetitive scenes, only semi-original factions, and the most annoying tutorial in the history of everything. Fire and Sword does bring a few new concepts to the Mount and Blade table however. It offers massed firearm combat along with swords, pikes, bows, etc. It also offers a few ""campaign quests"" which are simply longer than normal quests with fancy names. There are plenty of mods for Mount and Blade: Warband that offers just as much as this game does. Which isn't much.6.5/10			"

												With Fire and Sword had the blessing of being developed outside the usual cultural box that produces games in the US and western Europe, which gives it different assumptions, attitudes, and touches that most western developers wouldn't think of adding. That ranges from basing the saga on Henryk Sienkiewicz's work (check out the public domain books and the Polish movie trilogy if you're curious) to the little touches -- culturally appropriate armor and troop trees, religious icons in taverns and throne rooms, awesome furry hats. It's also more pluralistic than Sienkiewicz's works were, putting the Tatars, Russians, Swedes, Poles, and others on the same morally dubious footing.  The downsides are there, too -- quest-breaking bugs, level progression that slows to a crawl, lack of modding, Firearms change the game completely -- yours aren't great, but the first time you try to charge straight at an enemy, that wall of shot coming at you from the twenty rounds your enemy just fired show you how deadly it is.  It's not Warband -- solo heroics won't get you far. AI still doesn't know the meaning of leading a target, but what you gonna do?  Absolutely worth it if the price is low.			"

												Thoguh many compare M&B WF&S to Warband,it doesn't make justice with this game.The key feature upon which the comparison is made is guns,and those drastically change the combat.In M&B and Warband it's more simple and easier, you can be a one man army,thinning the enemy's army while your troops engage the now more weaker bulk on the enemy's army.But in WF&S, combat is now more realistic and harder. You have to plan ahead and use the terrain and your troop versatility to your advantage.You need to think, is it better to have a highly armored units to serve as a target for the enemy's marksmen,to deplete their ammunition, making them easier to handle by your cavalry,or is it better to pound them with marksmen. While your horde of infantrymen closes on the enemyand overrunnig them by sheer numbers and using as an advantage the slow reload speed of the muskets.I truly enjoyed the more historical take of this expansion on eastern europe, (though I'm a bit bias because of my origins).The towns are truly beautiful and much better than the previous games.And it can be always improved by mods (I recommend WF&S Enhanced), which further enhance  the game.Worth the money "

												Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword takes place in 17th century Eastern Europe. There are five factions to choose from, the Polish Commonwealth, Muscovite Tsardom, Cossack Hetmanate, Kingdom of Sweden, and Crimean Khanate. Each faction has unique troops each with its pros and cons. There is a leveling system in this game so you can upgrade your character throughout the game. You can play in first person or third person. Throughout the game, you will recruit soldiers to join your troop. They can be upgraded once they have a certain amount of experience. You can also hire mercenaries too. In combat, you can command your troops to form a certain formation. The game is very similar to Mount & Blade: Warband. There is some addition in Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword, there are new weapons such as muskets, pistols, and grenades. There are some UI improvements as well.Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword is quite similar to its predecessor, Warband. The buildings and troop uniform look accurate. The towns and villages look nice. I really like the UI improvements, it's really neat. There are many mods for this game as well.However, there are some bugs and glitches in the campaign. The animation when someone died because of getting shot looks weird. There isn't much ragdoll from the grenades as well. Some aspects of the game, such as the loading screen, aren't optimized for widescreen resolution. There is no Steam Cloud support for this game too.To conclude, despite some of its flaws, Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword is still a very fun and addicting game. I really enjoy the hours I played it.			"

It's more tedious and firearms with realistic damage is one frustrating mechanic.To its credit, the meelee + firearm battles are convincing.What ended my run in this game was a series of crashes resulting in lost progress. Stability is a huge issue with this title and if you forget to save, you'll not only lose your progress, but potentially the opportunities that appear in your lost game.			"

(save for the octosexual trans-mollusk bit, but you can pretend)M&B: WF&S is a great game. if you liked M&B: WB. I can almost garantee you will like this game. now let's just jump in*pros*-Guns (muskets and wheel-lock rifles at least)-Grenades (booming intensifies)-Sweden (YES!)-Bar fights (stickemup *hic*)-making money is not some sort of feat like in WB (but everything is more expensive)-better recruting system*cons*-No tournaments (sadness intensifies)-Guns are OP until higher levels (1hit kill till you have 15 armour)-no sea raiders I don't think (drinks from skull while crying)-Swedish Curassiers (WHY ARE YOU SO HARD TO KILL!)-Tutorial level gives you no freedom (at lest the tutorial is voiced)-still looks like a potato on max settings (at least I can play at 150-200 fps on my rig)So, in all. there could have been a few more features I would have liked to see in F&S, but I still like it.

												An RPG set in the medieval era...aren't they all?  But I digress.  Mount and blade with fire and sword is a fairly good RPG.    If you were to imagine total war on a smaller scale where you play as one of the soldiers, this is it.  You start a new game, make a new character and set off on your journey.  you can use bows, swords, shields and guns.  Bows will lose accuracy the longer you aim them and because the guns are muskets they have little to no accuracy from a distance.  You will wander around the campaign map doing quests for kingdoms pillaging villages and battling people.  you can recruit mercenaries to help you in your adventures or recruit random people from pubs.  You upgrade there equipment and will eventually have a force large enough to take over a castle.  These battles are large and hard to win but when you do win the spoils are awesome.  BUY THIS GAME.

You could be playing this game for a year and have all your men and top tier armor shredded by anyone with a rifle. I have no idea why so many people recommend this game. I have watched people do playthroughs of this game for a year and just have everything they worked for so easily stripped away. If you want to lead and armor and build a character over time I would recommend WARBAND. If you want to up the difficulty ridiculous and feel like you have to be on edge every battle, feel free to buy this game.			"

It's still kind of frustrating the way it is now, which is a pity since they already have the missing peices in their other expansion.			"

The weapons take quite some time to shoot (bows and arrows are better in my opinion). And pretty much isnt as fun as Warband. If you are debating on getting Warband of With Fire and Sword, I'll get Warband in a heartbeat. :P			"

												Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword takes place in 17th century Eastern Europe. There are five factions to choose from, the Polish Commonwealth, Muscovite Tsardom, Cossack Hetmanate, Kingdom of Sweden, and Crimean Khanate. Each faction has unique troops each with its pros and cons. There is a leveling system in this game so you can upgrade your character throughout the game. You can play in first person or third person. Throughout the game, you will recruit soldiers to join your troop. They can be upgraded once they have a certain amount of experience. You can also hire mercenaries too. In combat, you can command your troops to form a certain formation. The game is very similar to Mount & Blade: Warband. There is some addition in Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword, there are new weapons such as muskets, pistols, and grenades. There are some UI improvements as well.Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword is quite similar to its predecessor, Warband. The buildings and troop uniform look accurate. The towns and villages look nice. I really like the UI improvements, it's really neat. There are many mods for this game as well.However, there are some bugs and glitches in the campaign. The animation when someone died because of getting shot looks weird. There isn't much ragdoll from the grenades as well. Some aspects of the game, such as the loading screen, aren't optimized for widescreen resolution. There is no Steam Cloud support for this game too.To conclude, despite some of its flaws, Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword is still a very fun and addicting game. I really enjoy the hours I played it.			"

												Hesitant at first to play what looked like a clunky fps in the 1600s, especially since I knew so little about the Euro Northern wars of that time. I was so wrong. It's a delightfully fun sandbox game. Yes, it still has some bugs and the graphics hurt the eyes at times but the game play and depth is great. With only 38.7 hours into the game, I've formed a fairly competant mercenary band. Had a private rivalry with a Russian warlord that lead to me taking his fortress away after a month long siege. I started a Swedish civil war by backing a disposed queen. Succeeding in seeing her return to the throne. Strengthened the bonds of that broken nation by taking more lands from the Tzar of Russia to give to Swed nobility. Innocently started a war with the Tzar, inadvertently saving the Crimean and Polish realms from collapsing under Russian advances. Finally, got around to mastering trade routes and tending to the needs of my subjects. Took a few hours to get the handle of charging on horse back and timing sword swings to kill my foes as I rode past, but I love this game now. Oh so very very much. Commanding my intrepid band of mercs to overrun castles and forts, I don't think I'll grow tired of this game any time soon. Looking forward to a Steam sale to try out the viking and napoleonic eras of this game!			"

												Get Mount and Blade: WarbandHonestly, I like using guns, but with this game, I ended up using bows since I couldn't even hit point blank (I've even tried using cheats to mod the skill to the highest to see if it did anything). Guns have a lot more range than bows, but I can snipe a lot of people with bows since they are a lot more accurate. Of course, on easy, the AI is so bad that sometimes, they will stand in a line while I stand to the side just sniping and killing at the same spot. If I do it with a gun, I miss 4/5 times. The  storyline is heavily bugged. Currently, according to the game, I became Tsar and Raven became Tsar afterwards. The former Tsar is still present as a Tsar, though. I've interacted with the former Tsar and he was given a castle by Raven (which I took from our enemies to begin with). I betrayed Raven so that I could become Tsar, but I can't do anything that a Tsar can do. (I've even followed the walkthrough exactly for this quest.) I've finally resorted to downloading a save game editor, but there is no support for With Fire and Sword while there is support for Warband. You might as well just go for Warband due to mods and lack of support for this game.			"

												This game is the ultimate add on to Warband other than Napoleonic Wars, it is probably the most intricate and highly competitive game that there is out there on Steam. Everything about the mechanics makes you want to try harder so that you can master anyone. This game does have guns, but not the sought you would find on COD. Imagine bieng a Musketeer where you have to make use of your entire inventory in order to rack up some kills. Once you buy this game, you will have invested into a very difficult but highly satisfying learning curve that can only be improved through hours of dedication. This really is not like a typical FPS where whoever clicks first wins.			"

												VERY GOOD GAME! If you are a fan of these types, you will be playing for hours. I played from 4pm to 12 pm once and fell asleep. The next day from 9 am to 8 pm when my mom forced me to do something productive with my life XD. Why to Buy : Good Game , Good Story , Fun Medeival Simulator, MUCH weapons, MUCH stats , and more!Why Not to Buy : There is only one reason. If you have a life dont buy this game. The game is so good thatyou will forget your life and never stop playing! Over all the gameplay and technoogy of this game is great, but the physics and graphics and textures could use some work. Would be great if they remade Warband , there most famous copy.			"

												Here is my thought on ""Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword"":Great gun reloading simulator10/10Shot directly at a guy's head and missedGot shot in the head by someone not even aiming at me11/9Now with all seriousness, the game is good. Flat, plain and simple. It's not great (aka the other two titles), it's good. Now let me explain. First of all, this game actually has  more realism than Warband did. Want me to explain? Well, back within this time period, a shot anywhere generally meant you were dead. The infection would kill you, or the musket ball, the size of a small double-sized grape, would penetrate your body and break bones, ligaments, or even veins and arteries. In other words, musket balls could kill in one shot. In fact, it is possible to die by getting shot in the foot, or even in the leg without medical treatment. The musket ball itself would cause so much damage to the veins and arteries that the person would bleed out very easily. So I do give the game realism points when it comes to the guns. The bows, I believe, are slightly underpowered, but that could be based on my own limited knowledge of the game. The AI isn't as good as Warband, no where close. I had about 40 enemy units running into a wall trying to climb up stairs that they seemed to think didn't exist. If you want more of Warband (aka ""sword swinging simulator""), then don't get this game. However, if you do want large line battles with troops moving into 5 lines or so and waiting for your command to fire, then you will enjoy this game.			"

												Warband is the better game, but if you enjoy the setting, the historic appeal of F&S should be enough to keep you into it, despite some blandness/drabness, much of the same and the lack of a fully fleshed out map. Being based on a 19th century Polish novel, minor historical inaccuracies can be forgiven. That said, it has a great soundtrack and i enjoyed the change of pace and locale for what it's worth.			"

												 Based on the novel, With Fire And Sword, this will enjoy any history nerd. Set in the mid-17th century in Eastern Europe, you can try to help one nation rise above the other nations. The five nations are... Muscovite Tsardom ( Russia), Polish Commonwealth ( Poland), Kingdom of Sweden ( Swedish-held territory), Cossack Hetaman ( Cossacks), and Crimean Khanate ( The Tatars). You will probably lose lot's of time to it, plus it's nice to see a new era in a video game. Oh, did I mention GUNS!!!			"

												Guns are so op in this game it's amazing this could have come out with the game. I love the Mount and Blade series and really loved Warband. And I think they had a lot of ideas right in fire and sword (mainly having village elder and what not as a clickable option so I don't have to run around towns trying to find the elders) but the guns in this game ruin it. First mission with the bandits I get head shot before I even reach the enemies. Nothing more annoying then being on some NPC's no-scope, across the map, head shot montage video. I have high hopes for this series because it looks like it's going in the right way, but I can't recommend this game because the combat is so broken, and for a game which revolves around combat it's to big an issue to not be adjusted.

												While this game may not have the charm of M&B:Warband, it definitely scratches that itch to command an army of musket wielding troops and watch them pepper an army of idiot peasants trying to run screaming away from you.The game itself is much like the rest of the series, start out with almost nothing but the weapons and a horse you are assigned by difficulty, then complete 'quests', join a faction and try to rule the world.  A cast of semi interesting characters join you on your ride through fake history as you lay waste to the country-side.The customizable troops you can get is a nice touch, and if you get enough cash (eventually you will via plunder or trade) you can effectively travel with an army of epic geared troops, slaughtering everything in your (or your lords) name.Story?  Bah who needs one in this style of game?  Your story is the story, basically making it so you yourself get to design your own story by destroying army after army.  Or die trying.  And stuff.Open world games are easy to get lost in, and while the graphics are dated (but being able to display 200+ troops in a FPS styled RTS is impressive in it's own right) there are worse things in life.I strongly recommend this game for people who wish that M&B had muskets instead of crossbows, as while the story isn't a big leap, the combat definitely feels fresh.  Skyrim this may not be, but in Skyrim you can't honestly lead 200+ troops around attacking people/villages at random or capture yourself a few castles without some serious modding.Also look into the mods/DLC for this game if you like multiplayer, the community is pretty cool.

There are some minor tweaks, a few new additions (the obvious guns/grenades), and a better combat system. However, the game feels a little stale if you played the others. It's certainly worth buying...if it's on sale.			"

												Mount & Blade the game is a wonderful creature. I've played many hours in this franchise, throughout several games, and I am nothing short of amazed. The basis for the game is so simple, I often wonder why more developers haven't tried something like this, but then I get knocked off a siege ladder for the second consecutive time by my screaming comrades, and feel like playing Call of Duty 36.This installment is a magnificent addition to the franchise - perhaps less-so on the RTS side of it, but definitely moreso on the combat/castle siege part of it. And that's one of the most beautiful parts to the game: There are many sides to it!Though slightly more limited than some of its predecessors (mods included), WF&S is an explosive entry into an explosive era in our world history: The era of the discovery and hugely widespread use of powder weapons.Being a generally combat-based game, this is the feature which I believe shines the most -- another facet of combat.Firearms bring an entirely new level of gameplay. Crossbows had a similar feel, but the sensation of riding down fleeing cossacks and driving a pistol ball into the small of their backs is hard to replicate without the resounding BOOM of a gun. You can really feel the concussion of many of these weapons. The graphics of them are at some points breathtaking. You trot several yards toward a distant wood-hewn fort, your many ranks of men beside you, having temporarily discarded your horses, and the fog is so thick, you can still barely make out the outline of the structure, though you know you must be close now. Suddenly, cries of germanic slang echo across the misty gully in front of a suddenly evident wooden wall, and more obviously, the gunshots follow, their concussions cutting through the haze like thunderclaps.Watching the blasts of powder-powered weaponry atop the walls of a wooden fort was all I needed to justify my purchase of this game.Then I got pushed off a siege ladder again.

												Hesitant at first to play what looked like a clunky fps in the 1600s, especially since I knew so little about the Euro Northern wars of that time. I was so wrong. It's a delightfully fun sandbox game. Yes, it still has some bugs and the graphics hurt the eyes at times but the game play and depth is great. With only 38.7 hours into the game, I've formed a fairly competant mercenary band. Had a private rivalry with a Russian warlord that lead to me taking his fortress away after a month long siege. I started a Swedish civil war by backing a disposed queen. Succeeding in seeing her return to the throne. Strengthened the bonds of that broken nation by taking more lands from the Tzar of Russia to give to Swed nobility. Innocently started a war with the Tzar, inadvertently saving the Crimean and Polish realms from collapsing under Russian advances. Finally, got around to mastering trade routes and tending to the needs of my subjects. Took a few hours to get the handle of charging on horse back and timing sword swings to kill my foes as I rode past, but I love this game now. Oh so very very much. Commanding my intrepid band of mercs to overrun castles and forts, I don't think I'll grow tired of this game any time soon. Looking forward to a Steam sale to try out the viking and napoleonic eras of this game!			"

												The only competition for Mount & Blade is another Mount & Blade.With Fire & Sword has been announced as ""More M&B, now also with a story"". It is basically a mod provided by the developers themselves, with a new (historical) map of Eastern Europe, new balancing and some tweaks. This is not M&B 2 or Warband 2, it is just a stand-alone Warband mod. The story takes place in a few ""epic"" quest chains, which offer a little more than the bare-bones open world medieval warfare simulator which the main game has always been. It is still 95% make-your-own-game open world, just spiced up a little.Be warned, difficulty is insanely high. You will try and fail many times before you even learn how to hold your own, let alone become powerful enough to win any significant battle unaided. I was originally surprised how bad the balancing and code quality were, but the post-launch patches have corrected many flaws and made it playable. Still frustratingly hard, but rewarding if you persist long enough.			"

												I have a love/hate relationship with this game. When I build a huge army, everyone runs away from me in fear, but if I go into battle with my huge army and end up losing, I go back to a tiny 1 man army.... just cuz I lost one battle. Annoying but I guess that's the challenge, eh? Pros-Fun gameplay and battles.Lots of different weapons and horses.The more power you have the more fun it gets.Fun multiplayer.Cons-This game is based on the fact that you can now use guns. But guns are totally useless because after every shot it takes 4 years to reload.Once you lose, you lose everything. It feels like you're just starting right over.It has a super annoying tutorial. Easy, but cheesy. "

												Overall it's ALMOST as fun as M&B: Warband. Unlike Warband, story of the game -this time- is authentic  and not a fantasy product. Continous wars between Swedish Kingdom, Russian Tsardom, Cossack Khanate and muskets! The saddest part for me is that game is bugged. Not tiny bugs! Big, story screwer bugs. I have lived the biggest of them in the storyline of Tsardom throught the end of my rebellions against the Tsardom and had to start all over. So what I mean is, save A LOT and use more than one (1) files to save! Otherwise it's just a moment to get screwed by a bug and frusturate. Such a turn off for a game like this. It's also very funny, when game screw you a lot with it's bugs, when you use a cheat it disables the achievements. What can I do if you bugged my gameplay and I had to use a cheat to come where I was at the first place! (teleport cheat on map). Storywise 9, gameplay 5/10.			"

												A development of Warband which is almost hidden from view. The obvious changes of adding firearms and new factions hides a much deeper alteration to the mechanics of the game as a whole including the ability to create a trade infrastructure for you to generate money, work for mayors and the guilds, support claimants, or take over a faction with scripted story driven quests. The soldier experience system has also been overhauled. At first glance this is simply more of the same but a deeper investigation shows a more mature and well realised whole than Warband.			"

												A fun standalone which offers a superior vanilla experience to Warband. The only thing holding it back is the number of mods (far fewer than its older cousin). Honestly, if there was even an equivalent to Freelancer (let alone Floris) for WF&S, it would be far better-recognised.			"

												I bought this game without realizing I wanted Warband. I cannot recommend this game to any fan of the mount and blade series unless you enjoy the multiplayer. You could be playing this game for a year and have all your men and top tier armor shredded by anyone with a rifle. I have no idea why so many people recommend this game. I have watched people do playthroughs of this game for a year and just have everything they worked for so easily stripped away. If you want to lead and armor and build a character over time I would recommend WARBAND. If you want to up the difficulty ridiculous and feel like you have to be on edge every battle, feel free to buy this game.			"

												only problem i find is there is no easy way to power. so far i have found it impossible to marry into power and or gain power after war efforts. Most the time youd be better off attacking a single country repeatedly until you gained high enough renown to be a merc.  or merchant.  most of it i spent traveling city to city so i could afford better armor since bandits are almost non existant. ( however you can  find deserters but they tend to be much harder to kill.) even on easy with starting clothes it only takes about two bullets to kill. with expensive armor maybe 6 if your lucky.  horses and guns and what not. i probably would have gone with neoplean though but i got this one cheaper.  worth the price. just hard ._.

												Great game. I started playing it only because Warband stopped working for me, but I'm glad I did. There is an improvement in graphics, and some of the combat mechanics such as blocking and mounted combat have also improved. The overall gameplay however, isn't as good as Warbands. Adding guns made it more fun in multiplayer, but it also increased difficulty in singleplayer, because you can easily be killed with one shot. You can't recruit people from villages anymore, you have to buy them from mercenary camps, which annoyed me, and having to pay extra to get decent equipment for your men is also a hassle. Overall it's a good game, not as good as Warband but it still has its perks. Great for multiplayer.			"

												It was a late night in Bread Village we had been sieged for over 10 days with continuously attacks, the men was starting to get tired and our morale was getting low. Then on the 11th day me and my men attacked the enemies base with great success but worse thing happend meanwhile, when we started to march home again you could hear the agonisingly screams from afar from the village where we lived. When we enterd the village you could se corpses lying on the ground for some reason it was only villagers from our village. We asked one of the survivors that was badly hurt and lying on the ground what had happend when we where gone, the only thing he said was ""HAIL THE BREAD!"" continuously while shaking. As he would said nothing more we want deeper into the village at the main hall where most of the survivor where they all stared at us and chanted ""The Bread"". A feel of dread slowly creeps over me. One of the survivors is my best commander and I ask him what the hell is going on. He then slowly starts walking towards me, and i notice that all other survivors are doing the same. I notice that they are all completely naked and they are all covered in flour and some of them have burnmarks on their skin. Their chants increase,""THE BREAD, THE BREAD!"". I saw that in their hands they are holding big white bread loafs, and slowly one step at the time they are coming closer and my commander is holding a huge sack of flour. I start yelling ""WHATS HAPPENING"" but no answers are given, i cant find and escape they have surrounded me and are continuously chanting ""THE BREAD!"". They are so close to me i can smell the delicious bread. They suddenly stopped when they where one meter from me their chanting was starting to fade away. One of them said ""What bussnies do you have with the holy bread?"" i answered ""what BREAD?!"". The moment i said that they started furiously chanting ""THE BREAD!"" one of then hit me with the bread in my face. Then the chanting faded again. One of them said ""The Bread is all that is holy and sacred do you offer your life for the Bread and is willing to sacrifise every thing for it. I think to myself what is this madness about this bread? the whole village has lost its mind. I screamd you are all INSANE! Then everything got dark...Based on an ingame experience10/10			"

												Fun until you get defeated by cheating enemys. Honestly the game slowly decays as the quests are less and less intresting and just plain boring. Campaigns are rare. Most quests you get are just to send a blank message from one lord to another. You will also notice times when the AI pretty much cheats the game and a group of enemys fire the muskets at you and regardless of how fast or which direction you go, They will instantly hit you. Above all, There are almost no combat missions, That once important ""Ransom a girl from bandits"" Quest is all there is to fight in mostly as you will notice that there is almost no bandits. Losing all your gear is pretty much always a bad thing. Mostly when you lose all your rare and favorite items. But instead of fixing that, They make it so that you lose all your good gear regardless of how hard it is to get. This game clearly only gets a 5/10. An average game. Not because of it's graphics or it's general setting. It is because of the bugs, Lack of content and other stuff. I really, Really want to give it a higher rate but I can not.			"

(Depending on what kind of person you are and how you like your games roasted that is) I myself bought this game about a year ago to add it to my collection of growing games. I have even placed it in my ""Favorite"" section near Skyrim, Natural Selection 2 and a few other select titles that I enjoy. I hold this game very highly for every aspect it gives to the player. The graphics are far from being good but once you fall in love with the game you can't help but enjoy the not-next-gen graphics. Combat is very basic but can prove to be a nuisance at times. Charging directly towards guns that are pointed in the opposite direction that you are traveling does prove to make matters worse. But hey! It's still fun!I haven't yet begun to find myself tangled in any of the main quests as I'm too busy trying to level my player and increase the size of my party to overtake castles in the name of the Crimean Khanate! Victory for my nation will follow within the next couple hundred hours I invest into this game.In this game you do find yourself running around a lot given the fact the map of the whole game is a whole country. My advice to when you start playing, pres Ctrl + Space. It allows you to travel and wait much faster. Also makes the game less of a headache once you have to travel from Akkerman directly to Moscow (both at opposite sides of the country).During sometime after you get addicted the game does get repetitve in both positive and negative aspects. The quests that nobles give are always the same 10 or so quests the game has. The combat is also repetive in feeling that it is awesoem! You truly have full scale battles against other armies. Victroy feels satifying and Defeat feel like, well defeat. Plus it doesn't help when some of your comrades bring it up to you that you suck.Overall, I can easily say that I recommend this game. The graphics aren't pretty and the combat isn't spectacular. But time and effort you spend into your Player will be more than rewarding. You eventually become attached. You try to talk to your troops and nobles but they never listen. I've never experienced any other of the Warbands but I can gurantee I'd be in love with the others as much as I am with Fire and Sword.			"

												A decent game, it is sort of a step down from warbands, though it has some nice additions.  You can no longer start your own kingdom in this game, but you have firearms and grenades, as well as stores in castles instead of major cities and various other additions that make up for the few things that were removed.  The game also supports 3D vision with no bugs (at least none I have encountered)			"

												Guns are so op in this game it's amazing this could have come out with the game. I love the Mount and Blade series and really loved Warband. And I think they had a lot of ideas right in fire and sword (mainly having village elder and what not as a clickable option so I don't have to run around towns trying to find the elders) but the guns in this game ruin it. First mission with the bandits I get head shot before I even reach the enemies. Nothing more annoying then being on some NPC's no-scope, across the map, head shot montage video. I have high hopes for this series because it looks like it's going in the right way, but I can't recommend this game because the combat is so broken, and for a game which revolves around combat it's to big an issue to not be adjusted.

												I loved the original M&B, but I hated what they did to the combat system in Warband. This one fixes a lot of those issues. Overall, it's the same game. There are some minor tweaks, a few new additions (the obvious guns/grenades), and a better combat system. However, the game feels a little stale if you played the others. It's certainly worth buying...if it's on sale.			"

												If you're a graphics snob look elsewhere, because they really are outdated. If you can get past that then theres the boredom of the first 20-30 minutes while you get enough money for some good soldiers/weapons. After that this is one of the funnest games I've ever played.At times you'll just want to break your computer because of a headshot KO  or some massive army killing you (took me awhile to learn patience and not immediately start looting villages), but the game just drags you back in because you want to beat it.Really the only criticism I have of this game is how they watered down the quests given by mayors and lords. 90% of the time it's ""hey, deliver this for me"", 9% is ""stop war"", 1% is go kill these baddy bandits (which there aren't even base assaults like warbands which I did enjoy).

I played it so much that I have more hours put into it than Warband. I just love the game graphics and gamplay. I also like it because it's historically accurate. If you like Eastern European history and awesome yet challenging gameplay, Get it! It's worth it.			"

												While this game may not have the charm of M&B:Warband, it definitely scratches that itch to command an army of musket wielding troops and watch them pepper an army of idiot peasants trying to run screaming away from you.The game itself is much like the rest of the series, start out with almost nothing but the weapons and a horse you are assigned by difficulty, then complete 'quests', join a faction and try to rule the world.  A cast of semi interesting characters join you on your ride through fake history as you lay waste to the country-side.The customizable troops you can get is a nice touch, and if you get enough cash (eventually you will via plunder or trade) you can effectively travel with an army of epic geared troops, slaughtering everything in your (or your lords) name.Story?  Bah who needs one in this style of game?  Your story is the story, basically making it so you yourself get to design your own story by destroying army after army.  Or die trying.  And stuff.Open world games are easy to get lost in, and while the graphics are dated (but being able to display 200+ troops in a FPS styled RTS is impressive in it's own right) there are worse things in life.I strongly recommend this game for people who wish that M&B had muskets instead of crossbows, as while the story isn't a big leap, the combat definitely feels fresh.  Skyrim this may not be, but in Skyrim you can't honestly lead 200+ troops around attacking people/villages at random or capture yourself a few castles without some serious modding.Also look into the mods/DLC for this game if you like multiplayer, the community is pretty cool.

												Eventually once I put more time into this game, I might have a better outlook on it. While the use of firearms adds a good twist to the game, it just doesn't have the same appeal to me as M&B: Warband. It took me some time to master the art of getting head shots with bows and crossbows in Warband. In WF&S, I'm getting headshots like crazy with a pistol right away and it just doesn't seem as fun. Maybe it's just me. I highly recommend getting the Napoleonic Wars mod for Warband and playing multiplayer on there if you're need to fill your slow-as-molasses-reloading gun fix.			"

												Hesitant at first to play what looked like a clunky fps in the 1600s, especially since I knew so little about the Euro Northern wars of that time. I was so wrong. It's a delightfully fun sandbox game. Yes, it still has some bugs and the graphics hurt the eyes at times but the game play and depth is great. With only 38.7 hours into the game, I've formed a fairly competant mercenary band. Had a private rivalry with a Russian warlord that lead to me taking his fortress away after a month long siege. I started a Swedish civil war by backing a disposed queen. Succeeding in seeing her return to the throne. Strengthened the bonds of that broken nation by taking more lands from the Tzar of Russia to give to Swed nobility. Innocently started a war with the Tzar, inadvertently saving the Crimean and Polish realms from collapsing under Russian advances. Finally, got around to mastering trade routes and tending to the needs of my subjects. Took a few hours to get the handle of charging on horse back and timing sword swings to kill my foes as I rode past, but I love this game now. Oh so very very much. Commanding my intrepid band of mercs to overrun castles and forts, I don't think I'll grow tired of this game any time soon. Looking forward to a Steam sale to try out the viking and napoleonic eras of this game!			"

												Mount & Blade: WFaS is an awesome game that combines the amazing gameplay from Warband with a twist of gunpowder, this minor addition alters the whole game darastically. This game is hard at first, it requires correct judgment of reach and speed whilst also challenging you to think about what direction to attack from. You can attack and parry from 4 sides, slash/parry from left, slash/parry from right, slash/parry overhead attacks as well as stab. The controls are very simple, a simple click and flick of the mouse in a particular direction will give you your attack/parry. The gameplay in this game is a mix of RPG, Strategy and Action, you will be controlling a main character, leveling them up and giving them weapons and armour. When you are in combat you will also be commanding an army (if you have decided to recruit troops) the commands are very simple, such as; hold, move up, charge and hold fire (with fire and  sword feature only).In short this game has given me hours of fun.

												I do like this one, but I prefer regular mount and blade because I'm not really a big fan of using inaccurate guns and bows. I prefer to go at the enemies with a large polearm and a crossbow. I do play lots of multiplayer with friends on it though which makes it more enjoyable for me.

												Story - With Fire and Sword takes place during the centurey of when humans made the very first firearms, aka Muskets, and flintlocks. Pros - Many quest. A main story line. playable. brings weapons from the very first firearms and grenades into the game. CAn be modded.Cons - Hard at the start. keep getting attacked by a deserter that you have paided to have passage. Guns can be one shot one kill. Hard to advance through the game. Hard to keep an army alive. bugs/gliches to where you have to restart the game. sometimes loss of save data. Items are too expensive. Personal Review - Could be a whole lot better. Was expecting more of a game with the Mount&Blade Title. Then again, wasnt made by TaleWorlds I suppose. Fair start into a game already with a main quest and other things. But you are forced to play through the tutorial EVERY TIME you make a new character. This game is not as good as I was expecting, I play it from time to time, but its nothing like Warband, and never will be. Armour is too expensive to get, and Deserters are too over powered are the beginning of the game.I recommend this game if you are looking for a game with some difficulty, even though you can set it to easy, it will still be hard.

												I was an avid player of warband, having logged many hours even before I bought the steam version.  (I would guess something like 1000 hours in warband)  regardless, I got the collector pack even though I owned warband already just to try this... mod.  The game removes alot of content that I liked about warband.  marriage and courtship have been removed.  You play for what seems like a very long time and then cant join a faction.  (buggy and broke)  No matter how high level you get a lvl 1 peon can one shot you with a musket if you are not contantly weaving on your horse to the point of sore hand joints.  Generating money in this game feels like work compared to warband.  You can't recruit units from villages anymore and train them up.  You can go to merc camps and buy soliders but they have a limited amount.  Even when your mercs level up through training and battle you have to pay to upgrade them, and it's no small amount.  Bottom line is take out most of what is fun about warband and then you get this.  It feels like work, not a game.  Anything battle over say... 1/3 your forces is almost impossible.  I once too out 120 troops with a 78 highly trained merc fighting force, to get garbage drops.  Best is like some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ +3 cloth boots.  Are you kidding me?  What about that lord I just face♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  I don't play on easy but even if you do you can still be one shotted, start of game or accomplished vet doesn't matter.  Frustrating game.  Quests are weak sauce too.  Deliver this message to (insert lord from other faction here who we are at war with) ... well WTF would I deliver stuff to someone i'm trying to kill?  How come you don't know the password for your own treasure?? (slight spoiler)  Don't buy this game.  Stick with warband and it's awsome mod community.			"

												If you liked the previous Mount and Blade: Warband title, I recommend this one too. If you have not played that one, I highly suggest playing that before getting this one. The single player in this is rather dull compared to Warband's but the time era difference makes it a bit more interesting. I mainly play this game for the multiplayer which is very fun.  My favorite mode is the captain co-op mode in which players can command their own AI to fight progressively harder waves of enemies. It get incredibly challenging after a bit and the game is definitely worth buying just for that mode alone.			"

												The only competition for Mount & Blade is another Mount & Blade.With Fire & Sword has been announced as ""More M&B, now also with a story"". It is basically a mod provided by the developers themselves, with a new (historical) map of Eastern Europe, new balancing and some tweaks. This is not M&B 2 or Warband 2, it is just a stand-alone Warband mod. The story takes place in a few ""epic"" quest chains, which offer a little more than the bare-bones open world medieval warfare simulator which the main game has always been. It is still 95% make-your-own-game open world, just spiced up a little.Be warned, difficulty is insanely high. You will try and fail many times before you even learn how to hold your own, let alone become powerful enough to win any significant battle unaided. I was originally surprised how bad the balancing and code quality were, but the post-launch patches have corrected many flaws and made it playable. Still frustratingly hard, but rewarding if you persist long enough.			"

												At first I was frustrated with the release of another stand alone from Tale Worlds, as I thought it would divert attention from their previous games and would I would have to pay for a whole new game. I also didn't see the point as there were mods for M&B and Warband that add most of the things that WFaS add, but I must say that no mods do it quite as nicely as WFaS. Graphically it is superior to all mods out there and there are some new features that are nice. The outfitting of mercenaries was a little awkward, so if that's a key point for you, you might look past this one. Overall though I would recommend it especially as a fan of the series, it is really well polished in comparison to mods of the same type for the previous games.			"

												Fire and Sword adds only what is seen in the pictures. It takes away every feature that made Warband accessible and enjoyable.  Tournaments, Productive Enterprises, Plunder and razing of villages, new faction creation from captured castles, recruiting from villages (replaced with a Mercenary Camp at every faction), and the ability to have a marriage. I played this enough to realize this is a downgrade not an upgrade. The map in singlepalyer is dull, mountainless, and has the same skirmish map for nearly every encounter. Guns in their current state are realistic in the fact that they destroy your health bar. This can be a very heavy imbalance when you cannot gain money to buy armor, buy recruits, and equipment. My friends and I could not have fathomed how disappointed we would be when we actually played the game. If you want a warband that has muskets and a historical setting, try Old Frontier 1755. I am only voicing my honest opinion.			"

												This game is a standalone xpac for one of my all time favorite franchises, Mount & Blade, but with historical factions and guns.  The fighting takes place in the 1650s during the Cossack uprising in Poland.  The game was a bit of a disappointment at release, due to some missing features (especially if you're coming from M&B: Warband) and a lot of bugs.  Its still buggy but its playable, especially with mods.  The SP is more story/quest driven than Warband, but make no mistake that its a sandbox game.  My favorite addition that it brings to the table is MP Captain mode, which allows you to control a squad of bots against other players or fight alongside them in cooperative mode.  This mode is actually really great; its fun to use your SP squad skills in MP, but there aren't a lot of people playing it anymore.  Overall Its a flawed game, but still a good one.			"

												While the campaign is next to neverending (I have not even finished it myself, and have only been able to eliminate two factions in the course of the game)  the multiplayer is pretty fun.  My favorite type of game is Captain Co-op in which you and everybody else leads a squad of six soldiers which can be upgraded as the round progresses.  There are 30 rounds in each multiplayer game (assuming your team can survive that long) in which after each 10 waves the enemy gets stronger.  Overall, a fun game in multiplayer.			"

												Mount & Blade: WFaS is an awesome game that combines the amazing gameplay from Warband with a twist of gunpowder, this minor addition alters the whole game darastically. This game is hard at first, it requires correct judgment of reach and speed whilst also challenging you to think about what direction to attack from. You can attack and parry from 4 sides, slash/parry from left, slash/parry from right, slash/parry overhead attacks as well as stab. The controls are very simple, a simple click and flick of the mouse in a particular direction will give you your attack/parry. The gameplay in this game is a mix of RPG, Strategy and Action, you will be controlling a main character, leveling them up and giving them weapons and armour. When you are in combat you will also be commanding an army (if you have decided to recruit troops) the commands are very simple, such as; hold, move up, charge and hold fire (with fire and  sword feature only).In short this game has given me hours of fun.

												 Mount & Blade series is great. Massive battles capable of 200 vs 200 combat both on and offline. Graphics are nothing to be amazed by, but once you get used to the controls and timing of your attacks, the game becomes very hard to stop playing. You can switch between 3rd and 1st person views, to cater to your play style. My only real complaint with this series horse riding. If you like Age of Chivalry mod for HL2, then M&B is worth a look.			"

												If heaven does exist, then this is exactly what it would be like.Jokes aside this game is crazy fun! (Depending on what kind of person you are and how you like your games roasted that is) I myself bought this game about a year ago to add it to my collection of growing games. I have even placed it in my ""Favorite"" section near Skyrim, Natural Selection 2 and a few other select titles that I enjoy. I hold this game very highly for every aspect it gives to the player. The graphics are far from being good but once you fall in love with the game you can't help but enjoy the not-next-gen graphics. Combat is very basic but can prove to be a nuisance at times. Charging directly towards guns that are pointed in the opposite direction that you are traveling does prove to make matters worse. But hey! It's still fun!I haven't yet begun to find myself tangled in any of the main quests as I'm too busy trying to level my player and increase the size of my party to overtake castles in the name of the Crimean Khanate! Victory for my nation will follow within the next couple hundred hours I invest into this game.In this game you do find yourself running around a lot given the fact the map of the whole game is a whole country. My advice to when you start playing, pres Ctrl + Space. It allows you to travel and wait much faster. Also makes the game less of a headache once you have to travel from Akkerman directly to Moscow (both at opposite sides of the country).During sometime after you get addicted the game does get repetitve in both positive and negative aspects. The quests that nobles give are always the same 10 or so quests the game has. The combat is also repetive in feeling that it is awesoem! You truly have full scale battles against other armies. Victroy feels satifying and Defeat feel like, well defeat. Plus it doesn't help when some of your comrades bring it up to you that you suck.Overall, I can easily say that I recommend this game. The graphics aren't pretty and the combat isn't spectacular. But time and effort you spend into your Player will be more than rewarding. You eventually become attached. You try to talk to your troops and nobles but they never listen. I've never experienced any other of the Warbands but I can gurantee I'd be in love with the others as much as I am with Fire and Sword.			"

												This game is so awesome especially if you have played the original as well, the shooting on the battlefield with guns is really cool and so satisfying once you get some guns that actually hit something at range, still a good charge squad will whipe out anything really even a group of good shooters so calvary is still king in my opinion. You don't stop a wall of spears on horses period. Castle aproach is a bit different and a lot of fun too with guns and grenades (LOL). Mount and blade warband is still the more balanced version and the better version in my opinion but still this is a nice addition to the series.			"

												Fantastic addition for a great game.  Full of 16th Century style, including some great moments with mounted gunpowder combat.  For anyone who wants to know how a Dragoon fights, or has even a passing interest in the military of Scotland, Sweden, Germany, Eastern Europe or Russia - give it a try.With advanced formation for gunnery, fire on command for lethal volleys, flanking fire, and fast commands for row formations, you couldn't want for more tactical options.  Curassiers, and some great Pikemen complete the mix.			"

												Some might call this the black sheep of the series because of the plain and repetitive pattern on the mapscreen and in the towns/villages but this is what this game has that the other didn't have. GUNS n' GRENADES. You are pinned down behind a weak pine tree. You've taken out every cavalry the enemy lord had to send by his riflemen got your number. And what is it that caused your death behind that tree? THEIR GUNS. Another example, you are up against a big stack o' baddies and are armed to their teeth with swords and sturdy armor. What did you use to reduce their platoon to a meat rain? That's rite. GRENADES. But some might also nitpick on the swinging controls and such but personally I don't see that as a problem. To me, Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword have got everything the other ones had and more to it. 8 outta 10 :)			"

												This game is a standalone xpac for one of my all time favorite franchises, Mount & Blade, but with historical factions and guns.  The fighting takes place in the 1650s during the Cossack uprising in Poland.  The game was a bit of a disappointment at release, due to some missing features (especially if you're coming from M&B: Warband) and a lot of bugs.  Its still buggy but its playable, especially with mods.  The SP is more story/quest driven than Warband, but make no mistake that its a sandbox game.  My favorite addition that it brings to the table is MP Captain mode, which allows you to control a squad of bots against other players or fight alongside them in cooperative mode.  This mode is actually really great; its fun to use your SP squad skills in MP, but there aren't a lot of people playing it anymore.  Overall Its a flawed game, but still a good one.			"

												I was an avid player of warband, having logged many hours even before I bought the steam version.  (I would guess something like 1000 hours in warband)  regardless, I got the collector pack even though I owned warband already just to try this... mod.  The game removes alot of content that I liked about warband.  marriage and courtship have been removed.  You play for what seems like a very long time and then cant join a faction.  (buggy and broke)  No matter how high level you get a lvl 1 peon can one shot you with a musket if you are not contantly weaving on your horse to the point of sore hand joints.  Generating money in this game feels like work compared to warband.  You can't recruit units from villages anymore and train them up.  You can go to merc camps and buy soliders but they have a limited amount.  Even when your mercs level up through training and battle you have to pay to upgrade them, and it's no small amount.  Bottom line is take out most of what is fun about warband and then you get this.  It feels like work, not a game.  Anything battle over say... 1/3 your forces is almost impossible.  I once too out 120 troops with a 78 highly trained merc fighting force, to get garbage drops.  Best is like some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ +3 cloth boots.  Are you kidding me?  What about that lord I just face♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  I don't play on easy but even if you do you can still be one shotted, start of game or accomplished vet doesn't matter.  Frustrating game.  Quests are weak sauce too.  Deliver this message to (insert lord from other faction here who we are at war with) ... well WTF would I deliver stuff to someone i'm trying to kill?  How come you don't know the password for your own treasure?? (slight spoiler)  Don't buy this game.  Stick with warband and it's awsome mod community.			"

												I am a big fan of the Mount & Blade games but when I read the discription of this one I didn't think I would like it. It sounded like they left the traditional sandbox and went with a quest base game. I also didn't think I would like addition of guns but I was wrong. This game is still the awsome game I have grown to love. It seems a little harder and the guns change the stratagy a lot but it is still the best game ever. These are true sandbox games. Hard to get started but loads of fun. If you don't have it you should.			"

												M&B: With Fire & Sword is my favourite game out of the Mount & Series. It's more or less an RPG set during the Deluge in Eastern Europe in the 1600s. Join an army, or rebel against the powers including Poland, Sweden & Russia. My favourite part of the game is slowly developing your character in a way that is similar to that of The Elder Scrolls games (skills, inventory, quests, etc,.) and travelling across the map to hire soldiers and unique mecernaries for your army.I had one problem with the game and that was completing the main quest which proved impossible as I didn't follow the instructions properly, didn't complete the required tasks in a specific amount of time or committed actions earlier which halted the development of the story. I could not complete the game from this point and had to start again, it's wise to save your game before undertaking big quests.Despite the story problem, I love this game and I had alot of fun playing it!8.5/10			"

												I think this game is better than Warband but other people will probably disagree. It's more story driven, and there's guns. The units don't level up as much as they do in Warband, they just turn (veteran) and the mercenaries are lame. I guess I prefer the units in Warband but I also like how there's none of those stupid♥♥♥♥♥Khanate units that all they do is run away the entire fight, and if people want to run away, you blast them with your nine son.

												Its overall a fun game i really like the captain mode. The aiming of the muskets and commanding your troops takes a little time to get use to. Ive had alot of fun playing this game. Its well worth the cost . It has an upgrade system too. You have to start with basic equipment on most servers but you can work your way up. Theres diferent armor and weapons. On captain mode you and other players command squads of soldiers which can be upgraded to better unit. It takes multiple waves to get elite units.  I have no real complaints about this game and im usually picky about games.			"

												Great game. I started playing it only because Warband stopped working for me, but I'm glad I did. There is an improvement in graphics, and some of the combat mechanics such as blocking and mounted combat have also improved. The overall gameplay however, isn't as good as Warbands. Adding guns made it more fun in multiplayer, but it also increased difficulty in singleplayer, because you can easily be killed with one shot. You can't recruit people from villages anymore, you have to buy them from mercenary camps, which annoyed me, and having to pay extra to get decent equipment for your men is also a hassle. Overall it's a good game, not as good as Warband but it still has its perks. Great for multiplayer.			"

												Set in eastern europe,1655,the age and invention of firearms.What it lacks in graphics it makes up for in mass AI battles or online battles,with up to 200 per server.Cannot even describe the greatness of the campain with a storyline based on the cult novel, ""With Fire and Sword"", from Nobel-prize winning author Henry Sienkiewicz.If you love historically correct soldiers,weapons and map then this is the ultimate game for it.

												The only competition for Mount & Blade is another Mount & Blade.With Fire & Sword has been announced as ""More M&B, now also with a story"". It is basically a mod provided by the developers themselves, with a new (historical) map of Eastern Europe, new balancing and some tweaks. This is not M&B 2 or Warband 2, it is just a stand-alone Warband mod. The story takes place in a few ""epic"" quest chains, which offer a little more than the bare-bones open world medieval warfare simulator which the main game has always been. It is still 95% make-your-own-game open world, just spiced up a little.Be warned, difficulty is insanely high. You will try and fail many times before you even learn how to hold your own, let alone become powerful enough to win any significant battle unaided. I was originally surprised how bad the balancing and code quality were, but the post-launch patches have corrected many flaws and made it playable. Still frustratingly hard, but rewarding if you persist long enough.			"

												This compared to the original mount & blade, awesome, but I feel like there's missing so much stuff like weapons (the guns are cool though) and just small things like tournaments. In this game there is also new stuff like pub fights, newly decorated castles on the inside, and the mercenary camps are cool. I'm not saying this is a bad game, but I would get the original Mount & Blade first or buy this on a sale (like I did).			"

												I guess this version is worth the price.  But nothing much going on except very large battles.  This would be okay but because of the army size limit your personal army in the battles is 10 or 12 men.  Not many bandits.  There are quests provided but they are all buggy. I recommend because of the guns and low price.			"

												This iteration of M&B adds guns (pistols, muskets) as well as a new map with new factions (not fantasy - Cossacks, Crimeans, Muscovites. Poles, and Swedes). As a result, much of the game's presentation is historical in nature. You'll see references to people like Jan Sobieski and Cardinal Richelieu. Nonetheless, WFAS still enables the same level of flexibility as other M&B games. Want to be a bandit? Sure. King? Done. Trader? At your leisure.If I had to voice any complaints it would be that there are no tournaments (RIP ez cash farming) and no marriage system. Highly recommend.			"

												As good as any other Mount&Blade game, i mean really good.In my opinion rifles being added to game isn't that bad. Yes, they are a bit overpowered because you can reload them while moving, however if you look up the k/d lists in servers, you can see that players with the best scores are always playing melee. I play this game since it is published and it was same back then. I think that this game has great multiplayer and still not filled with auto-blockers like Warband MP.About the singleplayer, I think it is really good but really difficult. I only played Cossack Hetmanate and Polish Commonwealth campaigns(there is also Russian campaign which is also awesome). Even though they are very difficult as you should be always prepared and often encounter unfair battles, they are lots of fun and well planned by the developers.My overall score is 9.5/10 also considering its price. For this price, it is one of the best games you can have and a game that you will never ever regret buying.			"

												Here is my thought on ""Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword"":Great gun reloading simulator10/10Shot directly at a guy's head and missedGot shot in the head by someone not even aiming at me11/9Now with all seriousness, the game is good. Flat, plain and simple. It's not great (aka the other two titles), it's good. Now let me explain. First of all, this game actually has  more realism than Warband did. Want me to explain? Well, back within this time period, a shot anywhere generally meant you were dead. The infection would kill you, or the musket ball, the size of a small double-sized grape, would penetrate your body and break bones, ligaments, or even veins and arteries. In other words, musket balls could kill in one shot. In fact, it is possible to die by getting shot in the foot, or even in the leg without medical treatment. The musket ball itself would cause so much damage to the veins and arteries that the person would bleed out very easily. So I do give the game realism points when it comes to the guns. The bows, I believe, are slightly underpowered, but that could be based on my own limited knowledge of the game. The AI isn't as good as Warband, no where close. I had about 40 enemy units running into a wall trying to climb up stairs that they seemed to think didn't exist. If you want more of Warband (aka ""sword swinging simulator""), then don't get this game. However, if you do want large line battles with troops moving into 5 lines or so and waiting for your command to fire, then you will enjoy this game.			"

												Si je le recommande c'est surtout pour son univers particulier et surtout pour la série Mount and Blade. Imaginez, il y a plusieurs royaumes, vous n'êtes qu'un vagabond avec une armée de mercenaires, vous vous faites attaquez par quelques bandits et vous pillez quelques villages. Enfin c'est un des nombreux scénarios de départ, vous pouvez vous faire remarquer par un royaume et ainsi être un seigneur de celui-ci ou créer votre royaume en possédant des châteaux ou des villes. Les seules limites que vous avez c'est votre niveau d'expérience qui influencera le tout: votre armée, votre équipement, vos compagnons qui peuvent aussi évoluer, vos relations avec les royaumes, les quêtes ainsi que vos capacités sur le champ de bataille avec différentes armes, vous préférez foncer dans le tas avec une lance et un cheval ou attaquer à pied avec un bon gros fusil ? Vous vivez vraiment une aventure et vous y passerez des heures avant d'être riche et roi, je vous le garantis !			"

												If you're looking for a Mount & Blade mod with superb multiplayer, this game isn't for you. It has a couple servers here and there but warband offers so much more, the only reason I'd by this is for the campaign. You cannot create your own faction in this one, but you can go through the story lines of all the factions in the game. Is this Campaign mod really worth that much? up to you. Also it has a squad defence mod where it has u control squads of men with other human players to survive a swarm of bots. Really fun.			"

As in warband, the melee combat feels unbalanced/unrealistic, but I'm a good sniper so its not a game-breaker. Huge multiplayer sieges, when the game came out there were 220 players in a server, the scale was epic and no lag! I admit, I like this game more because I often have the highest score (30 kills/ 4 deaths) on a 100+ player server, playing a camping sniper musketeer.			"

												Although this game isn't as good as Mount and Blade Warband in my opinion, it still is good and I recommend you should buy it. The good thing about this game is the fact that it has firearms which are pretty OP in battle but the long reload time means that it would be helpful to have a sword with you just in case. The gameplay is just as nice as in the other games with great mechanics involving horses and guns and all weopan types making this a pretty releastic and action-packed game. Although there can be a few A.I. problems and you will run into the occasional texture glitch in battle and on the map, it will still be a fun game if you like Medeival action and strategy along with RPG and a few shooter elements.Here is the final score:Gameplay: 8.5/10 (If you like the genre)Story: 7/10 (Mostly sandbox which is fun but it has a storyline)Multiplayer: 8/10 (Hard if you're new but you will get better, multiplayer is only battles)Graphics: 7/10 (Well it's a strategy game)OVERALL: 8/10Pretty good, a must buy if you like Medeival Strategy and action games and you should try it out if you're new to playing these types of games but i recoment you buy Mount and Blade: Warband first.

												Much of my time in this (as well as most of my games) is spent offline, so while I look inexperienced, It may not be so.Nowhere near as popular as its medieval cousin, Fire and Sword is still a fun, entertaining game.Tired of those slow crssbows?Well they are no more, shoot your enemies with the (even slower) flintlock (or matchlock)!Tired of all that heavy armor, and those armored horses?No more! Bullets will kill you either way!Tired of the drawn out battles on your horse, lancing and repeating?Well, if want to get out easy, hurl some grenades at those annoying Cossacks!This game is Harlaus free, no chances of butter wars (Vodka, go for the Vodka).

												(30/12/13) Not a fan of this one at all; big disappointment. I thought firearms would make it more fun, turns out its just makes the game impossible. *(5/6/16) I decided to give this game another chance, and it turns out it's pretty good. The firearms and relatively low armour actually make this a lot more challenging and I wasn't able to create a god-like murdering machine who could single-handedly capture castles and towns as I could in the previous games. I'm looking forward to M&B II. ****			"

												Whilst not the most graphically advanced game, It offers a brilliant mix of RPG, Strategy and RP with strong game mechanics. I really recommand this game as I had a lot of fun playing it.			"

												Pretty good mod for Warband. Only real shortcoming is the lack of ability to start your own faction.			"

												NOTE: If you are reading this BEFORE buying the game, buy M&B Warband first. The learning curve for new players is almost vertical if you haven't spent a fair amount of time in M&B Warband first.Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword is game set in 1600's Europe. It is completely historically accurate, and has new weapons different from it's big brother Warband. These weapons include: Muskets, Carbines, Pistols, and Bombs. This also means that all types of weapons from Warband are in this game as well. The game starts out and asks you to make some chocies. Of course, no matter which choices you choose, you will always be put in the tutorial at the beginning of every new game. You start fighting bandits to learn the swordfighting mechanics. After that you find a man named Jacque de Clermont who helps you fight the bandits. Then, you all get on horses and fight some more bandits in order to learn the horse mechanics. But after that, you talk to Jacque a little more and are left to your own devices. This is why the learning curve is vertical for new players. There are more bandits/looters/brigands for every area than there are in Warband, and i learned that the hard way. You'll be getting killed a lot and will have no idea what to do for a while. Now, on to my opinions on the game. I think that this game is the best game for swordfighting and primitive guns usage in any game ever. There. I just do. The mechanics feel nice, look nice, and when you get a bunch of perfect blocks against a Winged Hussar with a Lance and you only have a saber, it feels so good. The battles are fun and engaging, and when you have a decent party and engage in a battle, you'll ususally be looking forward to it. Of course, there is also the ruler part. For a long time you'll be independent, but when you kill the subject of a king or ruler, any nations that are warring with that king you can now join to be a subject. After that, when you lead a seige you can capture enemy strongholds and forts for them to be your own. I don't think you can become the leader of a nation or create a new nation in this one like you can in Warband.Now the flaws. First, it doesn't look too good. I think it looks okay, but most people don't and will be driven away by this fact. It also is buggy. Every once and a while certain bugs will happen that will make you SO MAD.All in all, i rate9/10 Fantasic game, but has it's flaws.			"
