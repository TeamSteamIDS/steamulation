												I am fairly confident that Payday: The Heist is one of the best games I've ever played. At its heart, it's a cops and robbers game that feels a bit like Left 4 Dead, except instead of navigating on a linear path through multiple maps, you take control of and dominate a single map, and you only play as the robbers, not the cops. Featuring a diverse set of maps, a cool leveling system that encourages player experimentation and mobility, and generally just being amazing, Payday: The Heist is the single greatest co-op experience I've ever had. I think it's better than Left 4 Dead, to be quite honest.Would you like to know how many things I would change about the game?Zero things. The answer is Zero things. Because there are Zero things I would change. Actually, come to think of it, I would change one thing: the game's leveling curve is a bit 'off,' and newer players have a harder time enjoying the game until about level twenty or so, but that's a problem easily solved. Oh, don't get me wrong, I'd totally be up for adding new features--maybe better stealth, more customized ammo, more maps with more unique behaviors, and stuff like that--but the fact is, the game is just pretty awesome as it is.You can sprint sideways.You can use fake dummy turrets to keep crowds down while you steal a man's blood in the PC-exclusive Mercy Hospital level.You can sprint backwards.You can spend thirty-three minutes drilling into a secret vault hidden away in the game's first level.You can yell at Alex for being a terrible, terrible crane driver.YOU CAN SPRINT IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND THE BRENNER IS AMAZING AND THE STRYK IS LIKE PEW PEW PEW AND MY LOVE FOR THIS GAME IS SO INTENSE YOU DON'T EVEN...All of the game's features work well together. Only one of the maps--Heat Street--is bad. It's a co-op game. It's not a solo game. You play with other people, and you'll have a blast. I've bought fifteen or twenty copies for friends now.EDIT: Hey, just because I've bought copies for friends doesn't mean I'm going to buy a copy for you. A) I can't afford to do this anymore, and B) if you're a person who friended me at random, why would you expect me to buy you a game?			"

												Oh man, Payday: The Heist... This game carries so many memories for me. I know it's old, and the community isn't really all that active anymore, but this game still kicks ♥♥♥. Now, this isn't PAYDAY 2. You won't spend very much time devising plans or sneaking around (more on that later), but instead, you have a clear objective, and then you let all hell loose with some kickass weapons. So, is this game for you? But isn't PAYDAY 2 so much better? Well, let me break this down.In general, PAYDAY 2 has a more ""realistic"" feel, with your characters movement and weapons being a little less arcadey, and more down to earth. Payday: The Heist is exactly the opposite, and it's still great. Characters are fast, weapons have dead point accuracy (most of the time, not always) and in general it's trying to make you feel as little vulnerability as possible. And although you could argue about which is better, there's no denying it feels pretty badass.Another key difference is that one of PAYDAY 2's main selling points is that things within the heists switch around, making things more unique. The original lacks this in every single heist but one (which is my favourite, personally) and it does definitely wear on you after a while, however if your anything like me you'll play them again just because it's fun.I'm almost done with comparisons! Another big one is that outside of the beggining of two heists, there's no stealth, only guns blazing. So if your really into stealth, you'll probably prefer PAYDAY 2.And finally, the upgrade system. In PAYDAY 2, upgrading is quite complex. You have skill trees, even skill decks for bonuses, individual weapon upgrades, etc, making a very deep (albeit sometimes confusing) way to make your character powerful. The original streamlines this: All you have to do is pick which tree to advance in, and as you level up you get things from that tree (like weapons, perks, bonuses, etc.), with you being able to switch between trees at any time.So that's it with comparisons. So how's the actualy game itself?It's fast, furious, difficult, and just plain amazing. Assuming you get the Wolfpack DLC (which I highly reccomend) you have 4 skill trees, 9 heists, and all in all a ton of fun. I only have ONE WARNING: DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME ALONE! The AI is so stupid it's embarrasing. You can do it for bragging rights, or for practice, but this game needs to be played with other people, so get a team.Regarding the community, outside of Europe not that many people play it, so I suggest getting a 4-pack and playing it with friends.And that's my review! Hopefully you now understand which PAYDAY game is for you! (I reccomend getting both, if you can)FINAL SUMMARY:This game, and it's sequel, are amazing. Fantastic gameplay, great dev's, and hours upon hours of fun. Just don't do it alone!			"

												Payday: The Heist is a first person shooter game developed by Overkill Software and published by Sony Entertainment. The game was released in October 2011 on PC, after being released on PS3. The game is owned on Steam by over four million players due to its regularity being on sale. The gameplay is based around completing heists with a party of four people including you. This can be done either in a single player environment, or up to 4 player co-op online. The heists can consist of the classic bank jobs, right the way to the complete extreme of extracting blood from a highly classified patient. You play the role of one of the four main characters in the game, Dallas, Chains, Wolf or Hoxton.  Each member of the team can use a variety of different weapons, you are able to select your load out before jumping into a heist, so once you get to know what is needed to be done on each heist, you can select what to use accordingly. Each of the missions starts off in a stealth style mission, where you have to disable security camera, turning off alarm systems etc. Whether you complete these tasks successfully or not without being seen will determine how the rest of the heist will carry out.  These starting missions are done really well, and you will be fully immersed since most of them have you sneaking around a pitch black building trying to out manoeuvre the guards. A lot of the missions also come with the added obstacle of civilians – these are crucial in any of the heists as you can keep them hostage and use them as bargaining trades should one of your other team mates be captured by the police too. Whilst you can spend a good portion of the game in stealth and hopefully not being noticed, a good portion of the game will also be spent with you going all guns blazing as you attempt to fend off an almost endless stream of enemy police and SWAT.  The gunplay in Payday really well done. All of the guns feel as powerful as you would expect, and the choice of weapons is pretty big when compared to other FPS games.  Ammo does become a problem with your primary weapon since you’ll be shooting this off constantly at points, but can be easily countered by the abundance of pickups of ammo off dead enemies. Even though Payday is almost four years old at this point, it is still a really good looking game, especially when you ramp up the resolution to 4k. Originally I thought the game was made using the Source engine due to the familiarities in the graphics with the likes of Half Life 2 and Left 4 Dead, but the game is made using an engine called Diesel (made by GRIN, who are now defunct unfortunately). There are a couple of textures which are very low resolution which is a shame, but I can forgive this a bit given that a lot of the levels are actually fairly big, so this must have been done to reduce the need for loading screens.  The game has a really good ragdoll simulation too, when you are mowing down the enemies, they don’t just die in a normal fall to the floor fashion, each death is individually animated depending on where/how they were shot, which adds to the originality slightly. Payday is fully voice acted and done really well at that; the game is almost narrated by what seems to be someone behind the scenes instructing your team on what to do next on the heist. You’ll get remarks back from the rest of the team in responses to objectives being completed and you’ll also get a lot of radio chatter when you are in firefights with the police too. This is a really hard game. The first couple of heists come with the option to play them on easy mode; these must really be the games tutorial since they can be completed without any real problems; yet once you reach the third or fourth mission, the difficulty takes a big ramp up and you’ll actually find yourself either failing missions from not completing objectives, or because you have died or been taken into custody. I had to replay each of the last few stages of the game multiple times before I was able to successfully complete the heists. Even though the ramp in difficulty felt really harsh at the time; I began to enjoy the game even more because of it; because it’s not just as simple as a “get in and out” job, it forces you to plan your every move, and you will tread with caution around every corner because of the unknown ambush that awaits you. The game also has another two difficulty levels to be played on, Hard and overkill mode – these are modes which should not even be considered when playing on single player because you will not stand a chance. I tried the overkill mode out and it is just absolute carnage. I will definitely be asking friends to join in a game to give this mode a proper try out. Whilst all of the missions have the same key objective, and there is really only one way to complete said objective, it can lead to a little repetitive gameplay. The game does however try to counteract that by adding a little bit of randomness into the stages by shaking things up a bit; such as locations the locations of key civilians that you need to keep hostage, meaning you still have to go searching through the whole building to find them rather than rushing to the one place. Each of the levels has some form of random element to it which is nice to see, since you will be playing the same six or seven heists over and over again.I have put about twenty hours into Payday: The Heist so far and see no end in sight for it at the moment. There is still a really active multiplayer scene if you want to just find pick up groups with randommers, but I would highly recommend playing this with a bunch of friends on Skype to get the full experience out of it. The added levels of difficulty also adds plenty of replay ability too; meaning you will not run out of interesting content for a long while with this title. The game does have one piece of DLC which includes new weapons and two new heists, which is a worthwhile piece of DLC. The game is also extremely technically sound too; I was able to play on 4k resolution with all of the graphic options maxed out and I was still able to hit the heights of 160 FPS, so this is one of the best optimized games out there at the moment.  Keyboard and mouse is recommended to play with, given the FPS nature.Overall, Payday: The Heist is an extremely good game; one that I am surprised it has taken me so long to play, and one that I will certainly be keeping installed on my machine because of the high replay ability factor. The game is also very cheaply priced at £10,99 – but like I said at the start, the game is always going on sale, and most of the time it is for 90% off; at that price, is it an absolute no brainer to pick it up – you may as well pick up the four pack for yourself and friends whilst you are at it.

												I never thought I'd hear myself say this but...killing cops and stealing ♥♥♥♥ is so much fun! never thought I would like a game like this, but I do like to play the occasional fps (such as rainbow 6, or borderlands). Payday is very challenging and yet at the same time so rewarding; when I finally complete a mission I've been struggling with I feel EPIC. It's very addictive, and the only negative thing I have to say is that I wish there was something to spend all your money on in game, like with Payday 2. I also really like that this game has co-op, I play with my husband and we have a blast. I highly reccomend this game. 2 thumbs up.10/10.			"

												When I got PAYDAY 1 on a steam sale, I didn't play it till my friends got it. And now it's one of my favorite games. Even though PAYDAY 2 is out and I find that game really fun, I still come back to this game because the 2 games have 2 different play styles. PAYDAY 2 is more realisic and strategic, while PAYDAY 1 feels like it's more Left 4 Dead or Mass Effect 3 multiplyer. It also feels more fast paced, sending larger waves of enemies in maps that offer poor cover causing the player to use their unlimited sprint, and 0 reduction on your speed due to the armor you must wear to survive, to dodge and return fire on maps that contain both close and long range encounters. Both of the PAYDAY games are on my list of best games I've ever played.I highly recommend these games.			"

												Started to play this game without too much expectations when the game was free for a day, since it has only a limited number of maps. I certainly didn't expect that this game would be fun even after 1k or even 2k hours. Admittedly this game has lots of flaws, but in part that's what makes it such a great game. The random elements in the game, spawns, enemy pathing and to a lesser extend the objectives, make the game unpredictable and failure is always around the corner. Unlike some Co-op PvE games out there, you actually have to play tactical and watch your HP (using ""shoot and cover"") to complete the heists on the higher difficulties (and for beginners even on the lower ones). Failing to do so will get you punished (although you can get away with it to some extend when playing with a VERY good team) and in all likeliness gets your character killed.Besides the satisfaction of beating the game on the highest difficulties with a good team, you can basically make it as hard on yourself as you want. If the default difficulties aren't enough, install DorHUD and play on an even higher difficulty with even more spawns (and yes, this makes a huge difference). Seeing all those helmets flying is a reason to keep playing the game and there's always room for improvement: more kills per minute, better accuracy, fewer downs, faster completion of the heist or just competing to be the best in the stats at the end of the heist when playing with other players, which can make for incredibly fun games ;).The only downsides of this game is the crappy bots (although this can be seen as a factor that makes the game harder) and the fact that there are quite a few cheaters. As a programmer and creator of (an attempt of) an anticheat module (+more), DorHUD, it's actually part of the challenge to find ways to beat the cheaters or at least expose them.In fact, I didn't only have fun playing the game but also improving it. It's one of those things that are not for one or a small number of ""uses"" and I can get to enjoy the changes every time I play it. Of course there are also a number of downsides to this, but it feels good to help improve a game that I enjoy playing.Since this is a review, maybe I should mention that it's worth even its full price. On sale it's only €2.48 (€3.47 with the soundtrack DLC that gives you an extra set of masks and some awesome music). It's roughly the price of one glass of beer, but you can play this game for a lot longer than you can enjoy that beer. You can even play this game after having drunk lots of beers (or vodka, if you prefer that).			"

												Imagine Left 4 Dead except you're shooting cops instead of zombies.There's a level progression system in the game just like in the sequel, but you don't have to worry about any of the RPG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t elements, just level up and spend points. Imagine more like Killing Floor where playing the game gives you progress  on each class. You can grind it out to get there faster, but that'll go against what the game's pushing you towards.People say it's comparable to Payday 2 in that they're the same characters and world, etc. They're wrong. The game is paced completely differently: heists aren't meant to be quick in-and-out situations, they're long, gruelling marathons you have to push through. They also don't function on an ""all or nothing"" reward system. If you fail right at the end, that's okay, you still get money (experience) for every objective you completed along the way. It's not as rage inducing as ♥♥♥♥ing up a Big Bank stealth right as you're opening the vault, then having to run and get the god damn drill because alarms went off.That's another thing, there's not really stealth save for one or two missions. Don't be a ♥♥♥♥in' ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥. When you ask yourself ""Are we rushin' in, or are we goin in sneakypeaky like?"", the answer should always be the former. Stealth in this game is a lot harder, and it's more of a dickwaving contest kind of situation when you can stealth the few maps, rather than being the optimal strategy necessarily.Overall, it's worth picking up even if you have Payday 2. It's not like the Left 4 Dead series in the regards that L4D2 replaces the 1st in every way, they're just completely different games with different mechanics.			"

												Payday The Heist is an amazing game that you should not buy for full price. It goes on sale for five dollars at least four times a year, and then you'll probably be able to grab the Wolf Pack for 99 cents, which is almost necessary to feel like you got the full game. If you've played Payday 2, I need to warn you that the two games are fundamentally similar, but that's where it stops.  Payday:The Heist does not have as many mechanics as Payday 2; you will always be a speedy, slightly tanky glass cannon who is in danger of running out of ammo and must take cover to survive prolonged assaults. But this gives the game a tension and skill ceiling that really augments the gameplay. Payday:The Heist is much more scripted than Payday 2; in general you are playing the heists the way the developers intended and some may find that repetitive. But the heists are SO MUCH BETTER than in Payday 2! Nothing in Payday 2 comes close to the sheer creativity and versatility of what every heist in Payday:The Heist throws at you. It's very tough to get bored when a single heist involves you visiting a hospital, restraining all the civilians, impersonating doctors, breaking into quarantine, drawing and purifying blood samples, restarting the power to get the elevator working, crashing into the morgue and commandeering an ambulance for the escape. It's really a kickass game and you're missing out if you don't try it.			"

												Compared to Payday 2, this game is quite the challenge. No regenerating health, no converted cops, no godlike weapons.Just you, your team and common sense.You got a simple arsenal that you can upgrade by levelling up and all of the deployables are only usable once, so you gotta be sure you wanna use it now.You can't run in Rambo-style unless you're a masochist who enjoys dying every 30 seconds and getting put into custody constantly.And hey, the Overdrill still exists if you really wanna have a ""fun"" challenge.

												Payday can be a little bit jarring if you go in expecting something like a bank robbery simulator and instead find that all your jobs almost immediately devolve into re-enactments of the movie ""Heat"" and/or the Battle of Stalingrad. Don't worry about it. That's Payday.And while summiting Mt. Deadcops doesn't quite tickle the same area of the brain that gets turned on by expert planning and execution, it's still a pretty rewarding co-op experience with loads of personality. Make sure you have some friends willing to play before you buy, because this game is meant to be social.			"

												Have you ever dreamed of robbing a bank, jewerly store or stealing a well-secured precious object?Almost everyone do that sooner or later, in FPS PAYDAY™ The Heist you can try it out either with AI or up to 4 players in cooperative mode. The game brings you to every detail of heist, from entering target facility to escaping the police if necessary, which can be very tricky. I enjoyed FPS side of the game, shooting a lot of cops, whose raids are really common and after a while you will be surprised how many police forces are in the city ready to dying trying a heist of 4 robbers. On the other side defence is not a problem at all, the difficulties start with a lack of ammo - that's what I suppose as the biggest obstacle. I recommend this game for coop gameplay, with a bunch of friends it is really entertaining, but in singleplayer mode the game is almost unplayable, because of the uselessness of bots. 7/10			"

												It doesn't feel like the predecessor of Payday 2, hell no, from the gameplay itsself I'd even prefer it compared with Payday 2.You got less bugs, no dlc warfare, a proper environment(birds in the sky, rain,... all missing in Payday 2) and way more fun.No inspire, no dodge, no weapon dlcs make the game harder than pd2 and that's the reason it is way more fun.Yes it lacks the variety of maps, but I like less proper maps more than thousand of ♥♥♥♥ maps(forest, diamond, mallcrasher, 1.000 times bank heist is ♥♥♥♥ and never played again after the achievements to be honest).It's really fun to play and you need a proper team for the 145+ heists, sadly most public players got 145+ with Overdrills and run around like chickens but if you found some proper crewmates you can play it all day long.

												This game, I would say, is better than it's sequel in many ways.1-it's more polished. sure this game isn't beautiful or complex, but it has far fewer glitches, bugs, it's more balanced and is just generally more, finished.2-i personally find far more enjoyment from it's heists, which last a decent amount of time and are very satisfying to pulloff, aside from some lack of replayability without friends.3-the game seems, well, fair. it's balanced, the cops can both put up a strong fight but also don't take extortionate amounts of bullets to kill and in no heist are all odd's against you.4-it's cheaper, easier to run and more unique, in it's own action-movie homage way.what i will say that is bad is that it's no beauty pageant winner and has quite a rustic style of fighting, and isn't entirely quick to connect people to a lobby and could've had more done for it overall.I recommend this, especially if it's on sale, and don't mind that this review might've been a TL;DR.

												Once you start up Payday you can instantly see the resemblance to Heat, a Michael Mann-directed action movie. Every level is about a heist - you go in, you grab the money and you get out. In the meantime, dozens (if not hundreds) of cops are hurled against you. The 4 of you must work together to survive the level.Every level has sections. You always have to do something before you can advance. For instance, you are in a hospital where your job is to steal blood samples. However, in order to proceed to the section of the special patients you need to cut through a door with a saw. These machines usually require activation. Still, you need to remain close by to see if they stop so that you can start them up again.The waves of enemies get more frequent and dangerous. Same goes for the bank mission: you cut through the safe, but oh wait, you need some thermite to be able to enter the vault.Payday is one of those games where if you complete the levels you have pretty much seen everything. BUT! You have new weapons and other equipment to unlock once you level up. This so-called reputation level goes up till 193 and the higher level you are the more money you need to achieve the next level.Essentially, the replayability goes along the road Killing Floor has. Higher levels make you stronger (due to the new equipment) so you are able to pick a higher difficulty and replay the heists once more. Or die trying as this game is VERY difficult. Even on normal difficulty you will sweat to see the end of the road. And then you have at least 200 achievements waiting to be unlocked. :)PAYDAY is a fun game. If you have a lot of time on your hands and you like ""farming"" this is for you. "

												Comparing this game to PAYDAY 2, I generally prefer PAYDAY: The Heist for the following points:1. The ""loud"" is more fun here than in PD2.2. ""Diamond Heist"" doesn't have any client lag during stealth.3. The DLC is worth the price compared to many other PD2 DLCs.4. Masks are better and more in focus than in PD2.5. It more likely focuses you to play with other people, than solo.    - The heists are tough on highest difficulty, most of them impossible to be done with 2 standard players, sometimes even 3 standard players.6. Bain interacts more with the crew than he does in PD2.7. 2h Overdrill on Overkill 145+8. The Overkill 145+ difficulty.9. Overkill 145+ in general is more difficult than Death Wish (except you play PD2, PD:TH style)10. Undercover special waves...I prefer playing PD2 for the following reasons:1. Way more heists.2. You can easily solo run most of the heists (due to stealth).3. Stealth may be more interesting if you build the correct ""challenges"".4. You have more options what you could do in PD2, than in PD:TH.General ups (+) and downs (-) (most of them already mentioned):+ Way more co-op based+ It's harder (on the highest difficulty, default)+ Love those masks...+ Very nice soundtracks+ Focus on co-op- No Mercy has certain stealth issues- There's no focus on stealth in PD:TH, it's in general about ""loud""- Singlplayer works on Hard difficulty but is a pain on higher difficulties- Lots of hackers who can ruin your gaming experience.There's probably even many more points, which I probably forgot to mention. :)			"

												Many people compare PDH and PD2 together saying one is better than the other. They're both great games, however, they both exel in their own fields. In this review, I'll cover what PDH does better than PD2.  Firstly, we have the fluidity of the animations. Hot damn, those animations feel good. Just the feeling of reloading an AMCAR so quickly and effectivly gives me a great feeling of satisfaction. When chaining these animations together, it feels fluid, not jerky. On the contrast, the PD2 animations can feel jerky when put together making it not as satisfying to move around, reload, shoot. Secondly, we have the desync. This is a HUGE problem with PD2, however, I have found no instances where it is nearly as bad in PDH. People move where they are, not where they've been. Everything feels like it's not run clietside, but rather on a server where everyone has the same ping and latency. Lastly, we have the difficulty. PDH is MUCH harder than PD2, and it shows. The average success rate for heists is about 25%. Playing on normal doesn't just make the cops mindless drones like in PD2. This may be due in part to the low health and armor of the characters, but it shows. The game is rewarding and punishing. Now, for the downfalls. PDH doesn't have as many hesits as PD2, not as many weapons, not as many gagets. It doesn't even have skills. However, it instead has a RPG like level system which makes you work to level up all your skills. It is rewarding and difficult to get where you want. In the end, PDH is a much better feeling game to play, however, it does not have the new shiny look of PD2 with all its new heists and weapons. This game is for those who want a challenge from the normal rinse repeat of PD2. Not for the faint of heart (you've been warned!).			"

												Hands down, this game is more challenging than Payday 2 and funnier if you have 3 friends to play with. I recommend this game more than Payday 2 because skills and teamwork are required for finish each heist and is pretty more balanced than the sequel, also it doesn't have thousands of useless, overpriced and pay 2 win DLCs and microtransactions. If you want to start to play at this franchise, start from here.The cons? The game is almost dead, killed and completely abandoned by the developers, but considering how they ruined the sequel with their updates, it's not a real con. The few random players that play this game are cheaters or most people that aren't good enough to play over easy/normal difficulty. The experienced players mainly play in private or friends lobbies. So, be ready to play most of the time with the bots (that are really dumb). The only DLC present in this game, gives A LOT of contents. 2 heists, 1 skill tree with 3 weapons, 1 sentry gun and other special abilities.I dream this game will be updated by competent developers... but is not. Huge potential wasted.			"

												Hi,First off, I did walked thru and maxed my stats in this game 3 times (yes, I reseted by mistake and saved), but this game gets better and better the longer you play it!YES, it is hard at the beggining, and I hated it - hated the aiming, the constant getting hit by unknown cop, hitting me from 100-1000m with pistol (with accuarcy 95%) and the endless wave of cops swarming your position, when all you had is a crappy pistol and M16 with 3 magazines (and ofc no ammo).But before you agree with me even more, try to remind yourself starting playing every FPS you had in your life.. was it that easy at the beggining? Maybe, if your first game was PD2 ;)This game has everything you need!Great gamelay? checkGood graphics? check (remember this game is pretty old, and still looks nice!)Lots of guns? checkLarge and demanging maps? check!Not infested with DLC? CHECK! (yet it has some DLC, but it's worth having)Drill that jams every 5 minutes?! F CHECK! :DRecommend, 10/10 - this is what every shooter should looks and feels like!Sincerely,RFZ "

Nominee for the ""Test of Time"" awardThe best co-op game out there which 4 friends (or 4 total strangers) can have a blast playing the role of a high profile carrier criminal.If you like in-game eye candy over gameplay, play changing builds, crafting masks, modding guns this game isn't for you, check the other game.General Info:♠ Total of 9 heists to attempt, 7 from base game & 2 from Wolfpack DLC. Without the DLC you can still join lobbies running them but not be able to get few achievements tied with the 2 heists.♠ 5 Difficulties, easy(1st 2 heists only), normal, hard, overkill, overkill145+ & new addition of overkill193 (modified overkill145+) from DorHUD*.Pros:1. Very high replay value.2. Large heist areas, which you have ample space to run around.3. Good untiring graphics 4. Nice sounds. 5. Competitive Steam Achievements & challenges to complete.Cons: & some remedies 1. Cheaters -Even though this is not a PvP game there are a lot of pathetic fks who want to ruin your game. There isn't any built-in cheat protection, so it's a good idea to do a quick Shift+Tab -> ""View Players"" & check the stats of the players in the lobby. Having many abnormal heist finishing times, having masks which shouldn't have (not always a cheater though) are some indicators a cheater in your lobby. You may want to check out DorHUD* which will give you some useful information about players in your lobby & help you ban cheaters permanently.2. Disconnects - If it takes very long time to connect to the lobby there is a good chance you'll disconnect during the play.3. Some rare bugs - like falling out of the map*DorHUD http://steamcommunity.com/groups/dahm4pdGet a 4 pack & gift to 3 good friends or go public find some good friends & have fun!			"

												I have Payday the Heist and Payday 2 and after 2250+ gameplay hours still loving the simplicity of Payday the Heist. If i have to compare part 2 with part 1 then Payday 2 is more a CARRYBAG SIMULATOR wich is litterly a cashcow with everymonth new DLC. Overkill is so ORIGINAL that they even copied the Wolf Pack DLC from Payday the Heist to Payday 2. What i also dislike from Payday 2 is that you have to choose what armor and what gun you gonna use depending on your playstyle (Loud or Stealth). And giving point to Skilltrees to your character. In Payday the Heist beside a silenced handgun doesn't it matter what armor you take or gun compared to danger meter. There is no Stealth or Loud meter in Payday the Heist. That is the main reason why i like the simplicity from part 1. Not much weapons, but good and challenging enough. I get also a lot Payday 2 players in my Payday the Heist game server and all are complaining that Payday the Heist is pretty HARDCORE / much more difficult compared to Payday 2. What Deathwish or overkill is in Payday 2 is in Payday the heist more hard or normal. Find good players then you start loving the game. Communication and be nice to crewmembers is the key for beating the game. Overkill 145+ or Overkill 193+ with DorHud mod will be much easier if you have the right people in your surrounding.Payday the Heist has also few disadvantages, like no restart functionallity online. You have to die all together or shut server down and hope that the players will come back or you have to reïnvite them. Payday 2 has instantly build in option for restart online game. Payday the Heist has not so much levels. In beginning there where even less levels. Because No Mercy did not excist and later came the DLC Wolfpack. Although the support of Payday the heist is ended, game is pretty old (2011), i have still a wish for new DLC for extra levels. In total there are 9 levelsWith DorHud mod thanks to DorentuZ there is a restart functionallity added. You can also skip game intro's. Best part of the mod is : It detects cheaters!!!! It reports players who have a VAC-ban or do things that normally not can be done. You can kick them permanently if you want that. Trust me Payday the Heist does have a lot cheaters!! DorHud also fix a lot game related bugs that Overkill never before has fixed.More info : http://steamcommunity.com/groups/dahm4pdFrom what other players told me Payday 2 has also problems with cheaters. I stopped playing Payday 2 because i don't like the way how Overkill use Payday 2 as a Cashcow with all the DLC every month. Payday the Heist has sometimes troubles with bugs, but the game is pretty good. Some bugs could be irritating, if some one leave your server in No Mercy while loading level, the bot will stay in elevator and the level cannot be started (for example). In some levels you get shot by Swat or kicked by Cloaker, tazed by a Tazer trough wall or you can do shieldsurfing (Wallhacks).Some glitches are also in your benefit, like standing in Medic or Ammo bag will give you armor. So if you need to reload, hide in a bag. If you are almost dead, stand in a bag. If swat is reloading walk out the bag and shoot him. In Heatstreet if you hide behind a dumpster/container in a corner you can slam swat a lot without getting hit. Handy if you are low on ammo or health and need to bring your teammates back.The game maybe from end 2011, it is still fun to play. You will fall down a lot in the beginning, but keep trying then you gonna love it. I stopped with this game in the beginning because it was to difficult. 1 year later i did gave the game a second chance and i am still loving it. For me this game is worth every penny/dollar/euro.

												This game is all about killing 'cops' or 'sprites' depending how you look at things.In fact I actually have met a real live cop that plays this...Dead set! True! The conversation in game went something like this...Kyzka: So what you do for work?Cpt Bob: I'm a cop in real life.Kyzka: What? Seriously?Cpt Bob: Yeah.Kyzka: Isn't that like living a double life or something? A cop playing a video game where you’re a bad guy that kills cops for a living...Cpt Bob: It depends, I view it more as I’m in training learning all the things I should not do.Kyzka: Is that why you’re forever in donut shops?Cpt Bob: Exactly we try our best to arrive several days after the incident that way this sort of killing cop thing never happens...In game Cops pretty much arrive in waves the millisecond you start to look at someone the wrong way. Just like Payday 2 there are special enemies in the way of Tasers, cloakers, shields, bulldozers and snipers that spawn in frequently to stop you from getting your pay dirt. However unlike payday 2 the special enemies often act quite differently. For instance Bull dozers move much more faster than they do in payday 2, though they don't have as much health, still if you get shot twice from them it’s more often than not 'man down'. Tasers will often come in pairs and strike instantly. Cloakers have no warning sound that they are close by and most of the time will pounce on you when you’re trying to interact with something or someone. Shields other than the Gl40, there is no other gun which can penetrate their shield. Forget you’re Gl40 and the only answer left is to quickly try and flank them. Snipers in the droves are undoubtedly the worst. Every time I try the level undercover on 145+ I openly weep when I'm informed I have to go to the roof.The second biggest difference between this and Payday 2 is that ALL the maps are LOUD. None of them are 'True' stealth. Granted 'Diamond Heist' can be done stealthily on the easier levels, but try it on 145+ and it’s all guns blazing again. Sadly the stealth side of things was never properly instituted in this version of payday and so playing as a pacifist would never be a real option most of the time. There are only 9 maps in total with four different difficulty settings with 145+ being the hardest. (This is not including the fact that someone has created a mod which creates a 193+ level for those that love to experience sheer pain).The developers Overkill have finished with the game and have moved all their focus on Payday 2 even recreating the same levels from this one to there. So most people ask the obvious question, 'Why bother to play PAYDAY the Heist?'1) For the experience. Since both the skill tree and the special enemies react differently there is a much more rewarding experience in the level of difficulty fighting in comradery with three other team mates against the relentless sheer hell of countless waves in this one than you might experience in Payday 2. Since all capped 193 players have the same instruments at each other’s disposal it’s all about game play and team work. Have one person acting alone and it’s probably game over for the whole team. This game is so much harder, that I’ve actually seen people who have spent 5,000 hrs plus be taken out within seconds by a cloaker or a taser. Having said that the game also offers fewer enemies for those that try each map solo without bots. This has given rise to the gauntlet of challenges from die-hard fans in the fool hardy attempt of showing off their skills as they venture alone. Here is an example of two professionals who have raised to that challenge...

			I was really surprised even being able to pull this off once. O_o I can say though, RNG matters quite a lot. ^^ However, it's still hard even with good RNG. :P		

2) The history of the Original secret vault and what gamers had to do to get there is also a rich part of gaming history and to attempt it yourself is a 'must do' for any serious gamer out there . Here is a video explaining it all in detail... https://youtu.be/j7nFAURAGEM?list=PLv2Qcu6n6_mI9QeFdDv_xDSe5WL-6PuslSo, basically first you need to do all the heists on 145+ to get the golden mask. Then play the first world bank with three other people each wearing a golden mask standing in your respective positions, next you will have a 2hr constant onslaught of the hardest enemies  while you wait for the drill to get through. Only to be confronted by another room which requires a correct code to be entered into the floor tiles to avoid being gassed to death. Then you will get rewarded with one of the most beautiful vaults you will ever see. Some even claim that sending the video of the above adventure to Overkill will result with you getting a special secret mask.3) Another challenge I would recommend is doing the last level 'No Mercy' Loud all the way on 145+, without the bag glitch, there are no achievements for this challenge, the reward is simply knowing the fact that you have done the hardest level, on the hardest difficulty, the hardest way.The Payday Story stops abruptly and hints towards left for dead more than it does Payday 2. It honestly feels that something is missing like a payday 1.5 maybe?True there are plenty of Trolls, Hackers and Noobs in this game just like there is in Payday 2. True there are only 9 levels to grind away at while trying to reach that coveted 193 level, but it’s the level of difficulty and the constant dedication of the professional players who remain behind throwing out challenges and helping new ones that can make this game a really rewarding experience and a thumbs up.In final it is a great game to vent off some steam if you ever get a speeding fine, Thanks Overkill. Wish you were still here...			"

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Payday: The Heist is definitely one of the best downloadable titles.Payday the Heist developed by Overkill Software and released in 2011 is a coop based first person shooter falling in the same sub genre as Left For Dead. Payday essentially takes the gameplay elements from Left Four Dead and instead of a zombie setting, the game has a crime mob atmosphereThis game has been compared by the trolls as a ""Left 4 Dead clone,"" which is horribly false. It actually does have some reliable comparisons about each games'The premise of this game is great. You get to embark on only six various heist missions and complete different tasks. You get to play with four of your Co-op friends and there is plenty of teamwork and coordination involved. However, this game is insanely unbalanced.There's almost an infinite enemy respawn, There is a ton of upgrades for instance, which comprise new guns, less recoil, better accuracy, more damage, better armor, mines, new accessories, cuffs, etcYou can also take up to three hostages (for each member of your team, unless you exchange your ammo bag for three cuffs). But you cannot even move these hostages, you basically place them on the ground, tie them up and pray that the cops won't get to them because if they do, the time for negotiation and your subsequent release from custody gets extended beyond 3 minutes. And let me tell you, once one of your team members gets caught, there is very little chance that the other 3 members will be able to hold out for the entire 3 minutes. So the whole hostage thing is moot, just ignore them, or kill them so they don't get in the wayEvery frustration that I have described so far has to do with normal difficulty. I cannot even imagine what's it like playing on Hard or OverkillI honestly have no idea what the devs were thinking about this game. Why throw that many suicidal cops and swat team members? It is so unrealistic. All they do is use smoke occasionally, send in one member with a shield or taser gun. They basically make suicidal attacks like the Japanese in WW2, so you get to mow them down and get shot at the same time. When you get shot at, your screen jerks around, your aim gets messed up and your screen gets red - the typical FPS tricksll they had to do was lessen the amount of enemies, make enemies harder to kill, make mini tasks more interesting and add a fluid cover system. However, most of the mini tasks that you need to complete do not have any meaningful cover available, so you basically run around like an idiot and try to kill as many enemies as possibleOverall: The game basically crosses the line many times over where the frustrations pile up and it's not fun anymore. The game gets repetitive and tedious pretty fast. other than that. multiplayer is fair enough but it gets boring after a while.			"

												A rival for the THIRD-best multiplayer game I've encountered, after the formerly brilliant (pre-modded, pre-maimed) Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2.  It's also quite HARD, which makes it kinda tricky to play with your friends and/or relatives who are, well, kinda ""♥♥♥♥"" (to use the favoured gaming vernacular).  But if you're up for a challenge, and know a few ""peeps"" (read: hard-bitten criminal scum) who may also be up to the task, it's pretty hard not to recommend.  Hell, you may even want give it a burl with bots.  Though such foolishness is, of course, only bound to end in tears... Verdict: 9.5/10.			"

												Payday is one-of-a-kind, at least for me it is. When I first saw the clown masks, I could only think to myself - The Dark Knight. As it turns out, it is like the Dark Knight but without the Batman. It is the 'heist' that starts at the beginning of the movie. Stealing from a loaded bank while fighting off an unlimited number of police officers and SWAT is hardly an easy task. The money they said, would let me buy Steam games as far as the eye can see. I went for it. That's when the fire nation attacked. As I leveled up my reputation, I remembered the one thing that could save me, my ammo pack, so I laid it down and went to town. Pow pow pow, the SWAT went down and I escaped with my pockets full of cash. But alas, the bus driver had to end my streak, leaving me with a mouth full of gas.   There are other levels too might I mention.Obligatory score: 7/10			"

												Go back to where it all began, with the 4 original heisters... Payday: The Heist. If you want a game that actually challenges you and focuses on team play, then grab this gem. With only 1 DLC ever made (excluding the in game soundtrack), this is a true video game, not a DLC fest, like Payday 2 has become.This is a straightforward team based shooter with no strings attached and has some similiar game mechanics of Left 4 Dead. It is a game where you must work hard as a team or die as a team! It is an unforgiving game and the challenges become harder as you progress, until you get to the dreaded Overkill 145+ difficulty, which is much harder than the Deathwish on Payday 2. In this game, you do not have Skills, Perk Decks, Armror or fancy weapons (RPGs) at your disposal. Because of the lack of these things, you will need to work hard and be smart with your team, to overcome the Overkill 145+ achievements.The only negative is finding a team to play with. There is only a very small amount of people who play this (probably a maximum of 300 people online at any one time). But there is plenty Payday The Heist groups and of course the forum is still reasonably active. There will always be someone out there to help you, if you don't have friends to play with.So what does this mean for you? Well, go Steal, Kill and make a Deal, in the best Payday game made.Pros:-Original concept, before it got ruined in Payday 2-Very team focused game play-Very challenging experience-No DLC every month -No micro-transactions-No cross-overs (with game or film companies)-No large downloads every month (2gigs or more, are standard updates in PD2)Cons:-Small amount of players (this can be over come by finding groups / forums to get a team)-Game can lag a lot more than Payday 2 (especially if your team is from around the world)-Some minor bugs in game, that will probably never be repairedI give this game 4 out of 5 Beers.Cheers,Frost			"

												PAYDAY The Heist is a 4-player co-op FPS game in which you and your friends heist your way to wealth and glory. with nine well designed heists(Two of them DLC) to keep you busy.Somehow, it manages to be better than the sequel, Payday 2, with better and more balanced weaponry, better heists, better balanced hostiles and smooth, mostly intuitive controls. That said, it is not without flaws. The stealth system is not entirely as great as in Payday 2, but that's pretty much all I can think of at the moment.The progression is decent, giving you new guns and abilities over time while giving you plenty of gametime to unlock it all. You can choose what general direction to unlock things in on leveling up, and things unlock at a steady pace that doesn't leave you grinding for levels just so you can play as you prefer. All in all, it's well made and works fine.Overall, it´s old,but gold.10/10 Sweep  "

												PAYDAY The Heist is a addicting first-person action game which is incredibly good on both multiplayer and solo. The game has a variety of heists and jobs which are all unique, such as the diamond heist and panic room, which force you to think strategically and be efficient in completing the mission. You must delve into the mind of a master criminal as you organise you crew and fight against the law. I absolutely loved the characters and their variety of masks, particularly the staunch Russian, Wolf. Multiplayer allows a new experience as you play with people from all over the world and are required to work together for a massive pay out. You'll find yourself easily engulfed in this game, levelling up, making cash and becoming the worlds finest criminal.Overall 7/10			"

												PAYDAY: The Heist is a first-person shooter game developed by OVERKILL Software, the first of the PAYDAY game. First of all, DO NOT compare this game with PAYDAY 2, that game is newer than this and has been improved and upgraded a lot.PAYDAY: The Heist lets you play as 4 criminal named Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains in their criminal career, executing heist from robbing a bank, street chase, into breaking a hospital for something. It's not as easy as blazing your way inside as sometimes you have to make an entrances by drilling or blowing while defending yourself against police and SWAT assault in their attempt to arrest you. As you play, you will level up and get upgrades for your characters and weapons. PAYDAY: The Heist also lets you play cooperatively up-to 4 players.PAYDAY: The Heist has very decent graphics and effects. The Characters Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains has very great detail on them, and the police has many variant too which also affect the gameplay. The performances is also great, no problems at all, nothing broken.If you compare PAYDAY: The Heist with PAYDAY 2, PAYDAY The Heist is a game before PAYDAY 2, like many games with a sequel, the sequel are supposed to be better than the previous right? So don't compare them.Overall PAYDAY: The Heist is a good game, especially when you can play with your friends, 4 of them. It's harder to play this game alone in singleplayer, just try to find some friends or buy 4 pack. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

Payday: The Heist is a 2011 FPS developed by Overkill Software, and puts you in the shoes of one of four criminals who, by working together, seek to take down the next 'big score' by robbing banks, extracting prisoners, stealing diamonds and a fair amount of other stuff in between.The game plays mainly as an FPS with a couple of strategy/defense elements mixed in to the recipe: upon the start of a heist (not all, but most of them) you are given the chance to walk around the map and pick out surveillance cameras, guards, and the like, and to get into the best possible position before everything kicks off.Once the masks are on, the weapons are drawn and the yells/swear words start flying, the players are guided by their mission organiser, Bain, whom warns them of objective notifications, incoming police assaults, etc.Naturally, the cops aren't gonna shrug their shoulders and say 'eh, we'll let the interior security deal with it' are they?So they send in special units in with the waves, that are very hard for one player on their own to take out, Left 4 Dead style: The Taser can stun players, the Cloaker can incapicitate players instantly if they get within melee range, Shields carry riot shields, and (MOTHERF*****G) Bulldozers are walking tanks, deadly at short range and a pain to take down.While the game shines at its most in multiplayer, solo play is also an option, but at times the AI can be too incompetent: They always defer objectives to the player and can sometimes be a little dumb, running into firefights to try and get you back up if you go down without taking out the immediate threat first.The graphics are a little bit of a mixed bag as well. When looking around the environments, it's quite stunning, but when viewing models up close... Not so much.Despite these minor setbacks, Payday is still an awesome co-op game to play with a pal, or two, or three for an afternoon of robbery and assault. While it's sequel may have now beaten it by more than a big margin, the first game is still a great place to start, or if your rig is sadly not powerful enough.8.5/10.  A few niggling issues, but Payday: The Heist proves to be more than a solid enough entry for online co-op gameplay.  "

												This game is a remnant of when Overkill was so much better, long before gameplay got dumbed down, pointless ""new"" enemies, DLCs that pop out to slap you silly, oh and, no microtransactions. At least Overkill was smart enough to make this game (and the only good DLC they can offer) at a reasonable price. Believe me, you will save tons of cash if you stick with THIS game and not PAYDAY 2 and the horrendous content that has been infected by other cancerous games and cash-grabbing wh-0-res.In all, get PAYDAY: The Heist  to show Overkill how to make a good game and keep it that way.

 ""Damn, it feels good to be a Gangster"" ‘Payday: The Heist” is a fast-paced, edgy, co-operative first-person shooter (FPS) that takes its inspiration in no small part from the fantastic Michael Mann heist flick ‘Heat’. A pulsating background score, tense entry and setup sequences, interspersed with absolute chaos once the heist is underway, make this probably one of the best Heist games ever made.Campaign | Gameplay: Released by Overkill Software / Sony Entertainment in 2011, the game consists of 7 Heists that can be played in Single-player or Co-op mode, with an additional 2 Heists available as DLC. Gamers choose to play as one of the four main protagonists – Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf or Chains – each a specialist in his own area of Heavy Weapons, Explosives, Engineering/Tech, and Sniper/Support. Each heist also consists of a series of sub-objectives – which may include locating a key target (such as a bank manager), gaining access to restricted locations, destroying surveillance footage etc. Additionally, the fact that components of these sub-objectives will randomly spawn in various locations on the map ensures that no two playthrough’s of a particular heist are exactly alike - a major bonus to the overall replayability of this title. While playable in Single-player mode (supported by 3 AI controlled bots), the game absolutely shines in Multiplayer / Co-op where each member of your 4-man crew is a different player. Obviously, the quality of your experience and ultimate success of the heist will depend on the experience of your crew – but being part of a well drilled team provides an adrenaline rush that few other games will match.Flaws: In considering its shortcomings (and there are a few) – Lack of a single player campaign, short overall length (limited to 7 Heists), average graphics, somewhat clunky K&M controls (/no controller support), text-based UI, and an overall experience targeted at a narrow cross-section of the gaming community, you might think this is a game to pass on. But,… what it does, it does brilliantly well – and the thrill of running through a heist with a top-notch crew who work together, seamlessly combine to complete objectives, cover each other’s backs and take scores is something well worth the experience. ‘Payday: The Heist’ ultimately succeeds as an homage to the great heist flicks of the past – it’s slick, fast-paced, offers a good variety of heists, and is supported by a phenomenal soundtrack. Robert de Niro (in ‘Heat’) tells it like it is: “We do what we do best – Take Scores. You do what you do best – Try to stop guys like us”.

												PAYDAY: The Heist is an awesome coop game with lots of fun and endless replayability. I also recommend both of the DLCs for both of the additional heists, the soundtract, and lots of other ingame goodies. With both of the game's DLCs the game has a total of 9 replayable Hiests with lots of surprises, challenges, and ingame goodies to explore. The game is also super fun to play with a group of friends when playing in multiplayer. It's one the most enjoyed FPS games i've ever played. ^_^			"

 TL;DR PEOPLE THIS IS A LONG ONE, IN A NUTSHELL, 10/10 There are some people out there who don't know what this game is. Yet they know what Payday 2 is.I'm not one of those people. Payday 1, straight up and front, the father of Payday 2. Heisting, shooting, action, and some humor mixed in there. That's what Payday 1 is all about. In my personal opinion, this game is way better than Payday 2. I could go on for days, but I shortened it for you below.Pros:-Great heists. Very different from PD2. (We got Banks, Bridges, Panic Rooms, Streets, Hospitals, and even a secret vault)-Awesome and I mean AWESOME soundtrack. They set the mood for the heists.-Pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good dialogue. (""Like a GLOVE!"")-References. Most of them from heist movies, others from, well, other things. -Co-op power. Teamwork is awesome and the people on here are nice.Cons:-Premade masks. I know, I know. ""But Payday 2 has customizable masks!"" I DONT CAREEEEEEEE. These masks are awesome.(not that PD2's masks aren't, of course.)-Premade upgrades. Yeah, yeah, Payday 2 also has customizable upgrades. So? I got a gun, an ammo bag, cable ties and a scope. All I need.Besides that, nothing much. You probably didn't even read all the way down here. If you did, congratulations! Waste of time. Anyways, 10/10.			"

												The First installment of Overkill's series of Cop Genocide Simulators. Now should you buy this game? Do you like shooting guns? Then this game is for you. Do you like fixing drills and saws over and over again? Then this game is for you. Do you like civilians that run right into your gunfire? Then this game is for you. Do you like nearly making it out of a heist only for your entire team to be Splinter Celled just before the exit? Then this game is for you.  Do you like robbing banks and shooting cops? Then this game is definitely for you. Also the soundtrack is pretty good.			"

												Advantages : As Compared to Payday 2, this one has balanced weapons. One does not win more easily with more real-life money.Disadvantages : Doctor Bag and Ammo Bag requires players to play awhile on designed classes. For those who are not very good in FPS , this is a major disadvantage.This game has bugs which prevents some Windows users from using Steam Overlay , which is unfortunate.

												Someone's gonna want to shoot me for saying this, but I don't care: I think Payday 2 is better than Payday 1.BANGWith that said, here's my comparison for the two, staying as factual as an opinion can be, so you can decide for yourself what you want.Payday 1:Pros:-Large, complex heists-RNG is much less significant, you'll never be screwed before you start.Neutral:-Very difficult. This could be a pro or con depending on your perspective, but Payday 1 will destroy you if you go in without preparing, and will probably destroy you even if you do prepare for it.Cons:-Low weapon variety-Upgrade system: The upgrades are given to you in a specific order within 1 of 4 ""trees"" (really, they're sticks, a straight line). This means that, even if you never use the Crosskill, you may still have to upgrade it before you can upgrade the Brenner.-Loot system- You're paid for completeing objectives, meaning that you could make potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars without ever seeing the vault (in fact, there's a farming method involving playing First World Bank on the highest difficulty, completing the first few objectives, then suiciding on the first assault wave).-Only 9 heists- it may sound like plenty, but you'll get tired of them fast as you try to max out your upgrades-Enemy AI is incompetant-Allied bots are uselessPayday 2:Pros:-Much larger variety in heists, even without DLC-More characters-Many more weapons-Upgrade system-You buy a weapon, then you modify it. No trees involved.-Stealth heists-Loot system: You're paid for securing loot. In many cases, you have to bag loot and carry it to a secure area.-Greater enemy variety-More contacts (you aren't just listening to Bain the whole time)-More variety in difficulty. Death Wish and One Down are just as hard, if not harder than, Overkill was in Payday 1, but the lower difficulties ease you into the game, allowing you to get equipment and experience to prepare you for the harder difficulties.Neutral-Enemy AI is smarter. Not by much, but it's there.-Allied bots are more useful. Again not by much (unless you want to install this: http://modworkshop.net/mydownloads.php?action=view_down&did=12736 ), but at least they can soak up tons of damage while you accomplish things.Cons:-Alot of DLC (however, sales are frequent and significant)-More simplistic heists-Weapon mods are almost entirely controlled by RNG.-RNG can screw you over easily (it's possible for a stealth run to be made near impossible by a door to the camera control room not spawning-it's not even a glitch)They're both good games, really. But if you're a newcomer, I see no point in buying Payday 1 when Payday 2 exists			"

												PAYDAY The Heist is a 4-player co-op FPS game in which you and your friends heist your way to wealth and glory. with nine well designed heists(Two of them DLC) to keep you busy.Somehow, it manages to be better than the sequel, Payday 2, with better and more balanced weaponry, better heists, better balanced hostiles and smooth, mostly intuitive controls. That said, it is not without flaws. The stealth system is not entirely as great as in Payday 2, but that's pretty much all I can think of at the moment.The progression is decent, giving you new guns and abilities over time while giving you plenty of gametime to unlock it all. You can choose what general direction to unlock things in on leveling up, and things unlock at a steady pace that doesn't leave you grinding for levels just so you can play as you prefer. All in all, it's well made and works fine.The gameplay itself is pretty good, with cover playing an important part and no enemy feeling unfair or like an unreasonable bulletsponge. It makes sure that almost every thing you're doing is of importance, with a good pace where sometimes it is tense and other times you can take a breather. It feels like you're always doing something, whether its rejoining your group, running from cover to cover, or taking out a few special units. Somehow the drill jams less than in Payday 2 as well.Of course it's not all bad, the AI is just good enough to work, and the hordes of cops make you sometimes feel like you're playing L4D with cops instead of zombies, zombies with guns. There are surprisingly few negatives to Payday The Heist.Overall, it's a bit old, but it's still great. I'd even say better than its sequel. And with regular sales it's easy to grab some friends and go heisting. If the regular price tag is not worth it to you, a sale will probably start soon.			"

												This is a really entertaining and fun to play with others, kind of game.  The setting is just right, the game mechanics are there, and the music is top notch.   I remember buying it because of one thing, dynamics.   The conditions in a heist, will change.  From small things like location of items or chance of extra loot to spawn, to something larger like an entire room full of cash.   The feel of the game is there and the change in the game itself make it feel fresh, even after dozens of play troughs.   Also, there are different forms of ""heists"" in the game.   Most are simply ""go in and grab money/items"" but others are ""escort person from A to B"", but don't let that ""A to B"" analogy fool you in thinking it it easy *cough* Green Bridge *cough*.Anyway, this is just a great game to play either solo or with friends.  The only down side would be that the number of people playing it, has gone down but it is a tough yet entertaining game.  There are a few minor features here and there that are a pain, and are improved in Payday 2, but the vast majority of the game features, are all here.   Even the DLC is very well done and I HIGHLY recommend buying it as well.			"

 TL:DR  Cons - The Diesel engine is old, and while it doesn't yield its ugly veil as 'well' as it does in PD2, blemishes do present themselves- No tutorial.   I always felt that a tutorial would greatly serve PD, introduce you more intimently with the enemies and Special units and their weaknesses.-Hackers.  Are everywhere.  But if you are dying to find honest heisters, check out the Payday the Heist Online sub on Reddit! Pros-THIS GAME IS HARD.    And I love it.  While I feel its a shame it doesn't have a tutorial, this game pretty drops you directly in the frey and expects you figure it out.  It makes every heist a hard earned victory, and a vigorous one at that-For whatever heisters remain, its generally a very supportive community-A DLC expansion pack that is a true bang for your buck.  Hoenstly one of the best DLC packs I've ever bought-Fantastic atmosphere!  Each of the heists stand out for a variety of reasons, and its easy to tell them aprt. Verdict It's 15 bucks.  You're not losing much, and its some of the most fun I've played online!OVERDRAWN, SOAP BOX PREACHY SEGMENT: Story Pretty much none.  Most of, if not all the missions you play in this game are extremely isolated and I like that, very much.  The base story is that you, and three of your friends are proffesional bank robbers taking on the biggest and most elaborate hits.  Ranging some simple bank heists, to raiding a panic room for cash, to even stealing blood from a patient in a hospital.  While the mission total is short, (With the games expansion pack only offering an additonal two) there can only be around 9 heists.  But the RNG makes for great staying power. Mechanics/Engine PAYDAY: The Heist is  of the two, one of the more grounded games.  It knows its engines limitations, and is sparing with the spectacles.  PAYDAY 2 on the other hand, is a much more... Outstanding game.  With PAYDAY: The Heist, you are only able to go loud for a majority of the missions, or heists.  Only one two can be stealthed, by not fully.  Working in horde based siege modes, there are four phases to a mission:Casing: You and the crew are just casing the joint.  Taking in security previsions, placements and looking for objectivesAnticipation: The heist has just gone loud.  The police have just showed up, and it's about to go down.Assault:The police will, in favor of tacticallly approching your arrest, will instead besiege the area with armed forces.  Overwhelimg your defensives, on the higher difficulty.  They have a tendancy to really throw down the gauntlet. Control: This is the phase where the police pull a tactical withdrawl.  Though only briefly.  You use this time, to med-up and restock.  In certain cases, trade allies from custody. Music This is, where the PAYDAY series has always managed to impress.  The Soundtrack, compased by Simon Viklund, then Overkill's inhouse music producer and dialogue director, impresses as always with a booming soundtrack.  While the songs can not be interchanged, like in PD2, they are much more tied into the heist you're playing.			"

I did not get bored playing the same map for several times. The upgrading system is also interesting which is related to money earned (or stolen) as a thief.

												Aahhhh Payday: The Heist, you are like an old friend. The game is nice and simple, do this, go there, do that. It's calming. The weapons are all viable and solid, but you have limited ammo and need to preserve adding a degree of challenge. You have armor, but once that's gone you'll die fast. You feel real, like there's some high stakes involved. Then the sequel came out, bigger explosions, more weapons, mask customization, (slightly) better graphics. Sounds great right? WRONG! Everything feels extremely cluttered, you feel invincible, and there's so many things going on at once it gets really confusing. Not to mention the tenancy of new DLC every month that adds new guns, maps, and masks that are completely useless 80% of the time. Please, just buy the first. It has less maps and guns sure, but they're much more polished, smooth, and it's an immensley pleasent experience coming back to Payday after all this time.			"

												The OG Heisting game. This game is addictive and fun. It does not feature that many heist but thanks to the randomized spawn, everything is pretty much infinitly replayable. My favorite feature is the random events and the unique voice lines that the crew speak when events and objectives are activated.  Two of the heist are DLC but you can still join games, you just can't host them. With an amazing soundtrack this game is a great investment.			"

												When you first start playing, the game is hard as nails and requires strong teamwork and lots of perseverance to get through a heist on the Normal difficulty (only two heists are playable on Easy). However, once you've put in some time and level up, you become better able to survive and succeed. The game's general tempo is great, you're running around on this map constantly under pressure from the police, and periodically they'll send in tougher waves with special enemies like the ""Bulldozer"" (a super-armored SWAT trooper), ""Shield"" (a trooper with a riot shield, naturally), and ""Cloaker"" (a stealthy spec-ops type).There are three ""classes"" in the game: assault, sharpshooter, and support. While the difference between them is at first only the guns they use, as you complete missions you'll level up each class and earn more benefits. However, there's not really a system where you pick and choose your benefits: it's straight up ""higher level = better"", with no balances at all.One major aspect of the game's ""crime"" theme is the hostage concept. Civilians litter each level; shooting them causes police to act more aggressively, but they can be shouted down and zip tied to be used as hostages. If a player-character is caught by the police, they can be traded for a hostage, so in a sense hostages act as ""extra lives"". However, the police will also be trying to rescue the hostages, so maintaining control of them is critical. "

												What do I think about PAYDAY The Heist?Well, this is probably one of the best games I have ever played. You must be really pro to play it! In some aspect it is difficult, so thats why co-operative game is needed. Make your own crew, grab a lot of money and escape from SWAT!Actually, the idea of the game is perfect. First time I see a simulator of Bank Robbery Game, which is fu****g AWESOME!If you owned PAYDAY 2 and haven't got PAYDAY The Heist, you must purchase it and try for yourself. Now there are a lot of players who gain reputation by making OVERDRILL. If you want to feel real atmosphere of the game, then raise your reputation by fair play (It doesn't mean that you can play only Diamond Heist with Stealth on OVERKILL too :-P). Try to improve yourself. If you did all possible ingame challenges, make your own, or try to improvise (for example: LOCOOVERKILL 145+ ""If you know what I am talking about""; Pacifist in First World Bank, B9-S Pistol only and others...)I respect OVERKILL for their hard work and for this amazing shooter, that they have created!And yeah, DALLAS is the Best!!! ;-)See you at the safe house (c)			"

												In Payday: The Heist, players use a variety of firearms to complete objectives (usually centered around stealing a certain object, person, or a particular amount of money). The game plays from the first person perspective, but offers a few twists on the standard FPS formula. Killing civilians is punished, instead players may take a limited number as hostages. Should any player get arrested (after taking enough damage and not being 'revived' in time) during the heist, one of his teammates may release a hostage, allowing a trade to take place which allows a single player to be released. While playing the levels, players will notice a lot of variation in a single level, as there are often a large number of random events programmed in. An example of this is the location of the bank manager in First World Bank.The game focuses on four robbers (Dallas, Hoxton, Chains, and Wolf) who team up. Their first heist took place at the First World Bank, where they entered a vault by using thermite hidden on the inside of a photocopier and stole a large amount of money. A post-game message congratulates the group, telling them that they are ""set for life"", but recommends more heists, including robbing drug junkies in an abandoned apartment complex and ambushing a prisoner transport in heavy rain weather, simply for the enjoyment of the players.

												Now I've played the game a little longer, I think I can write a bette review than ""amazing game"". It is an amazing game, however it is not perfect. While I still highly recommend it, with time this seems to be slowly fading away. I love the game. I love the maps, I love the mechanics and just the overall feel when you complete a heist. However as the game gets older, more people seem to be fading away, and more cheaters seem to be arising. There is still a rich community of people who play this game, but good luck finding a public session containing good and nice players. What I'm saying is unless you already have a few friends who play, getting into this game is difficult. However, ♥♥♥♥ it, y'know, it's not expensive, just buy the game and see if you like it... cba to type a longer review on a phone touchscreen keyboard.			"

												Ah, Payday. I got the game while it was free and I'm glad I did. A fun game where you play as one of four members of a group which robs banks and conducts other similar heists. Playing with friends is highly recommended as you will either bask in glory when you all finish that perfect bank job or yell and curse at that one guy who won't help you back up. You start off with basic weapons and skills, but these are upgraded when heists are completed, objectives are achieved, et cetera. You will find yourself constantly replaying First World Bank because it's the only one where you have a chance of finishing, but the missions are also randomised a slightly different way each time you play them.If you consider buying this game but end up going for Payday 2 instead, try and get this during a sale. The assault waves in Payday 2 are still strong, but it always seems like the cops never leave you alone in this. If you get to a stage where you find Payday 2 is too easy for you, come to this. It is still a very fun and challenging game with friends and that is what keeps me playing it.			"

												Sim, o game possui um nome engraçado (PEIDEI \o\), porém fica apenas nisso mesmo. PAYDAY é um game que traz bastante seriedade em seu desenrolar. Você assume o papel de um bandidinho mascarado, e juntamente de sua gangue (Mais 3 amigos em Cooperativo) assaltam bancos e tentam roubar a maior quantidade de dinheiro possível. É um game que eu achei bem dificil, pois a quantidade de inimigos que aparecem depois de um tempo é absurda, por isso para se dar bem nesse jogo você precisa ser bom em FPS em geral, caso contrário você vai sofrer muito enquanto joga.. HAHA! Jogabilidade muito boa, gráficos bons e até mesmo a trilha sonora do game é ótima, porém peca na falta de enredo, mas nada que tire muito o brilho do jogo.------------------------------~ NOTA: 7,8------------------------------			"

If you watched and like movies about robbery as Point Break (1991) or Heat (1995), you will be delighted. Because each megabyte of Payday: The Heist full of references to these movies... and  to many others.Pros:+ A unique concept of cooperative game.+ Beautiful and minimalist design.+ Excellent balance.+ Hardcore.+ Additional capabilities (variability, in-game experience, challenges, customization)+ Crossover with the Left 4 Dead Universe (easter eggs, additional heist NO MERCY)+ Fair price (the game was distributed for free of charge during Crimefest)+ There is only 1 paid DLC (except OST) and no microtransactions (as in PayDay 2)Features:• Strong, but a modest content (like in Left 4 Dead)• Unideal AI (but much more smartest than in Killing Floor)• The game has no support by developers anymore (but it works perfect)• As a result - there is no anti-cheat (recommended to play with friends)Cons:- Some things should be realized much better (optimization, stealth mode, perks menu)- No support for custom modifications.8/10Outcome:ᅠPayDay: The Heist - a revolution in a particular genre of games. Cooperative robbery, wow!No more zombies, infected or mutants. Just cops and robbers. But there is a special squad, which is ready to kick your аss. And believe me, you have to make an effort that did not happen.ᅠCharacters, dialogues, sets and music - everything points to a lot of cult thrillers and action movies. This game literally consists of explicit and implicit references to ones. You will visit the deja vu on UNDERCOVER heist, in all senses.ᅠUndoubtedly, the product has some flaws. But it is necessary to take into account, that Payday: The Heist - debut(!) of Overkill Software (an independent studio at the time). It's made with lots of love, and isn't overly commercialized like PayDay 2.ᅠPayday: The Heist is able to gift you and your friends a lot of pleasant evenings and it is can be buyed during steam sale for a song. With this game you can to be in robber's shoes, not robbed. And, in case you are a big cinephile (like me), you will find yourself in paradise.			"

												Left 4 Dead 1 is a great horror co-op game, Left 4 Dead 2 is a great grindhouse co-op game, and this is a terrific heist co-op game.A lot less forgiving on the teamplay factor, regardless of the fact that friendly fire isn't a factor, the game rewards dedicated, planning players incredibly well.

												This game, is simply fantastic. It has 6 or 9 Heists, that are AWESOME to play through. I played PAYDAY 2 first, so it was weird at frist when I started playing this. Now, on to the Pros and the Cons!Pros:1.The gameplay is quite amazing.2.YE OLDE HOXTON.3.Skills are better than what they were in 24.No money like in 2, well, there is money, but it counts it as EXP.5.Tons 'o References in the No Mercy Heist like Dr. Acula from Scrubs6.SECRET VAULT. GO FIND IT.7.Cloakers are easier in this one.Cons:1.Chains sounds like a white guy that smokes and tries to voice act a black guy2.The Clown masks don't look like the icons or avatars you see3.Hard when you start at Reputation level 0, but it gets better.4.Really wish they'd come back to this...    So that's it folks! Can't think of anyhting else. Thanks for viewing!			"

												What is Payday The Heist?Well, it's a 4 player coop game. To put it short it's a wave based FPS. Mostly, players will try to hold ground and hold off the police till the objective gets done to progress further. Usually that involved drilling a vault, which takes some time. You hold out, get the loot, escape.Other than that some heist have multiple objectives to guard, thus leaving one or more behind to defend it. There are times when you need to get something fixed, so one player has to go and do that. Plus the game also has items that players can equip and share like medic bags, ammo.LevelsThe original game consists of 6 levels.Unlike Payday 2 or The Wolf's DLC, the original game's heists don't offer much variety, so you can't really go full stealth for example. One mission has stealth, but it's partial and too linear. Overkill also added an extra free mission, No Mercy, for free. Yes, it is inspired by Left 4 Dead.No Mercy & The Wolf DLC are basically the foundation of Payday 2. They are centered around dynamic events. Every time you play them, they may have items appearing at different locations, and random events happening at times.In depth look on mechanicsThe game has 3 special enemies: Bulldozer, Taser and Cloaker. It also have cops with shields and standard cops (their armor depends on the difficulty level). I think it's a very important aspect of the game. It keeps the gameplay from getting dull throughout the level.The game has armor and health: armor outlines your characters avatar in bottom right, and it can regenerate, health on the other hand can't. When you get 0 health you will be put into bleedout (last stand), after that you can either be put into custody or get saved by your teammates. Your teammates can also trade you for a hostage if you get into custody.The game also has a leveling system. 145 levels, though it's 193 if you get the DLC. You get 3 unlock trees (4 with DLC).  Each tree has 48 unlocks, and that's how you get new items, weapons and so on. It was kind of hard figuring out how to switch from one tree to another. You need to hold Tab, and either press [1], [2], [3] or [4]. By the end of the level, points are added to that tree. ConclusionThe game also has great atmosphere. Robbing banks ... well you get the idea. Just like in Left 4 Dead, you can wind up in situations where you will have to leave your friends behind. That makes for some funny moments.Friendly fire is off though (thankfully), so backstabbing isn't much of a thing.Personally i really like Payday's coop mechanics. Payday 1 is miles behind Payday 2, but the coop mechanics are pretty much the same in both games, and that what kept me playing this game for that long.DLC CompromiseThe game also has one DLC - The Wolf. It features 2 levels, but it's not necessary for you to buy the DLC to play the levels. You can join anyone who owns the DLC and play it for free. That's not a bug by the way, it's actually a really nice policy that guys at Overkill support. If you want the guns and the new upgrade tree, you will have to purchase the DLC though. It's a really fair compromise in my opinion, and most importantly, it doesn't split the community.			"

												This game is amazing, it's really fun and it's also really hard, unlike PAYDAY 2. Can't believe I actually refunded this game once... It has 9 heists, but they have different situations, which add up to replayability. And the difficulties can affect maps, too. For example, on any difficulty except OVERKILL 145+, the drill would be 30 mins. But on OVERKILL 145+, it's 2 hours (OVERDRILL).			"

												PAYDAY. The name says it all. This is an awesome bank robber game. The functionality reminds me a lot of an EA/DICE game, which is fun to play around with.  The game has good AI logic, the bots don’t run around doing nothing, they actually can think (unlike some games I’ve seen). From breaking into a bank, to taking out waves of police units, to taking all the money you can in the vault, this is a great game.			"

												My review for Payday: The HeistPayday: The Heist is a fun CO-OP game, where you play with your friends or strangers in different types of missions from robbing a bank to helping a criminal escape, The game focuses more on action than stealth like your typical heist movies, so if you like games that are more of a bank robbing simulator (or you just definitely want to feel like a badass robber) and pure action and that feeling you're in a heist movie then this game is definitely for you.There is also a sequel called Payday 2, If you're a fan of a hybrid of Loud/action and Stealth, then buy the sequel.

I've turned back to Payday: The Heist, and i was surprised - it is still exciting even now (three years later). I met a lot of cheaters, ""rage quiet"" hosts and most importantly - met with good people. It makes this game even more enjoyable for me. There is lots of pros like:- pleasant graphics- great soundtrack - random generating events- challenging difficulties- memorable level design- good optimization- smart enemies- low price ... and there is even more ... There is not much cons in this game:  - only 9 heists- dumb friendly bots- cheatersThis game was not AAA, but it will give you more experience then most of them - so grab it.			"

PAYDAY™ The Heist is a nice cooperative game. The design is very interesting and the maps are overall good. Controls are easy to learn, and gameplay's pleasant for the most part. Keep in mind however that this is a co-op game, I cannot say it is fun solo. It's also rather frustrating that it takes a large amount of time to unlock more weapons and items, and the game is exceptionally difficult which will definitely push away newcomers. Regardless, the game is entertaining and a worthy experience with friends. 7.2/10.0 "

												Lets get to it:Gameplay 4/5:As I'm sure you know, its a four player coop fps where you and your teammates perform different heists. Similar to the Left 4 Dead series, when you run out of health you fall down and your teammates have to come help you up before a timer runs out, but unlike L4D theres no rescue closets in this game, instead there are civilians. Players can shout at civilians to force them to the ground and then tie them up, and after a while the police will trade your teammate for a civilian, the time before the police will trade your buddy depends on how many civilians hes killed, the more killed, the longer of a wait.Assaults: Assault waves are when waves of police come and assault your team (simple enough, right?), almost every heist will begin with an assault wave. The police won't trade for civilians during an assault wavesSpecials: Just like L4D, there are four special units in the game, each one acts uniquely and is best taken care of differentlyHeists: Unfortunately there are only nine heists (six without dlc) in the game, so you can finish the game pretty quickly; fortunately each heist plays semi-uniquely. Each heist will probably take somewhere from half an hour to an hour. Theres not even a level editor.Online: Surprisingly the online community is still very active, enough so that theres still at least five people online at one amMusic 3/5:Very actiony music, suits the game wellGraphics 3/5:There graphics you would expect from a fpsOverall 3.5/5:This is one of the few games I would tell someone to purchase even while its not on sale			"

												Diamond in the rough. After getting annoyed by legions of cops (every city has millions, you know?!), who are shooting you in the head from 1000m-distance, you begin to understand, that this is not your ordinary shooter (also, it's not really a heist-simulator, it's more or less a tactical PVE-shooter, in which you have to survive enemy waves, while defending one or two objectives). It's difficult, and get's even more difficult after reaching lvl 145 and unlocking the 'Overkill 145+' difficulty. But this is where the fun begins. You need to know the map, you need a plan, you need a good team with good equipment and you need balls of fire. Need a challenge? Go for Green Bridge or Heat Street on max. difficulty settings. BTW, Payday has some great and diversified missions, some even provide a stealth-approach for the team (which is not used much in the first PAYDAY game, like i said, don't expect a real heist-game) and there are some random events and variations for each and every mission. You can also level up and unlock some new weapons, perks and equipment but it's not as grindy (really not) as PAYDAY 2!PRO PVE CO-OP! fun and diversified missions challenging really good gameplayCONTRA may need some time getting into heist-theme under-utilized too much cheating going on (WTF!)This game really needed more heists, otherwise perfect experience for me...

												Point Break meets Left 4 Dead.A refreshingly original IP. Fun to play solo; made better in co-op with friends.Each heist offers a unique mission, however with only a handful of heists the game demands a fair amount of repetition while the player learns the scenarios, increases their character's strength, and hones skills.Early levels can be off-putting due to the ineffectiveness of the characters' abilities - especially solo - but worth persevering with for the gratification of later levels, as the heists start to become too easy and it's time to increase the difficulty settings.- Skinny from the Fat B*stard (curator link) "

 PAYDAY: The Heist   is the 4 player co-op FPS(first-person shooter) video game developed by  Overkill Software . This game is all about robberies and heists, given by the mysterious individual Bain, handler of the PAYDAY Crew. And obviously, you're playing as the 4 robbers, calling themselves the PAYDAY Crew: Dallas  - Mastermind of the crew, leader, wears a smiling clown mask with the American pattern.He is also depicted as the ""Assault"" class in the game. Hoxton  - An englishman and the ""Sharpshooter"" of the crew.He wears a pink and white clown mask. Chains  - An afro-american ex-marine, wears a white, blue, and pink mask. He is depicted as the ""Support"" class in the game. Wolf  - A swedish ""Technician"", demolition man, and a psychopath of the crew.Wears the white and red demon mask.Each character has its own background, morals and a sense of humor.They're bad guys, but they're badass.So, there are two mods for this game, singleplayer(just you and 3 bots, useful if you want to learn maps) and multiplayer(with randoms or friends).Before the each heist, you and your teammates must ""pre-plan"" it(gear up your weapons, select upgrades and crew bonuses and etc.).If you've ever played Left 4 Dead before, you'll catch on quickly, if not, don't be shy, ask your teammates about something you don't know. And i should add, this game is very  hardcore on high diffuculities, so ""hold on to your butt""!And soundtrack is awesome!!!!!!Overall, if you and your friends want to have some fun, this game is definetly for you.I'm already tired to speak about it - heists, charachters, soundtrack, weapons , gagdets...bla...bla..bla ------>  9/10P.S. Buy this game and its DLC on sale, it is a little bit overpriced, but i can assure you, its definetly worth your time and money!			"

												PAYDAY: The Heist is a 4 player cooperative game which involves a crew of professional criminals attempting to score big by stealing various targeted items of high value. From cliche bank vaults to money printing plates, you can be sure that the local law enforcement won't make it easy for you and your crew getting out with the loot. Literally dozens of law enforcers will be dispatched to bring justice to stop your little crew from leaving the scene handcuff-free or alive.Everyone should jump at the chance to get this underrated title. Helluva rewarding game with intense gameplay with heavy cooperative elements aswell. Extra content for this game is already in the works to keep it alive. If you need a great 4 player co-op game for you and your mates to enjoy, look no further. Especially with it's cheap $20 price tag and more discounts to come, it's a steal! "

												I would solely recommend this game to players that have friends that are willing to play with you. This game is excruciatingly difficult to play by oneself because the AI's thinking pattern is: ""IS THE PLAYER DOWNED? IF TRUE: HELP UP, IF FALSE: CONTINUE GETTING SHOT AND NOT TAKING COVER."" It's not bad that the AI wants to help you, but when you get downed in an open area with cops everywhere, you're pretty much screwed because they couldn't give two 5h1ts if they're getting shot at while helping you up. But yeah, with friends to play with, this game is a really good time. Find some friends, and rob some banks/diamonds/gold, etc.			"

												The concept is interesting and music is quite good. However, developers failed at pretty much every other aspect of the game.The color scheme is ridiculously bad. Brown filter makes you sick almost immediately.Weapon handling is even worse than graphics. It feels that bullets just disappear into the thin air even if you're shooting the enemy point-blank. Killing waves of brain-dead cops is repetitive and annoying. Watching how they die is boring and unsatisfactory.And most maps are badly designed. Avoid.			"

												Compared to Payday 2, Payday: The Heist is a lot harder, easier to level up, less of a grindfest, and more fun in general.The only reasons that this is worse than Payday 2 is that the community is dead and there's not many weapons, and you also can't use steam overlay in it without having an outdated graphics drive.I'd give it a solid 8.5/10.

												Payday is an amazingly fun game. I like how simple, independent games like these always manage to get me to sink many more hours into it than any of the higher budget titles that are out. Unlike most shooters out, Payday forces you to play realistically. Your goal is not to rack up a body count, but to perform a heist. Rough around the edges, short in length, and aiming takes some time to get use to. However, in it's own way, it is very innovative. Each stage (lasting roughly 25-35 minutes) boasts with new surprises and situations depending on how you play and who you play with. No run through of any stage is ever the same. The stylish gameplay, cool concepts, and massive amounts of variety within it's few stages will keep players coming back for a very long time.			"

												Decided to come back to this from Payday 2, and this game does not ♥♥♥♥ing dissapoint.  Whereas Payday 2 has more options and an RPG style progression, Payday: The Heist is much more linear in how the game unfolds.  You can unlock all of the skills in the game, there are a small selection of weapons, and at most the ""skills"" are designed to work around a party of 4.What this game lacks in choice, it makes up for one of the best heist/action movie simulators you're going to play in a long damn time.  Straight up recreations of scenes from movies, or entire movies themselves.  Rather than throw 20+ different options to complete at a heist at you, you often have one objective to complete at a time, often with dozens of cops throwing themselves at you.Holed up on a rooftop with SWAT climbing up the sides and jumping from adjacent buildings at you? Check.  Fighting your way down a crowd downtown street, chasing a traitor who stole your cash ala HEAT? Check.  Sneaking into a highrise building to steal a buttload of diamonds while holding various corporate members hostage for negotiation?  Check and check.The graphics have aged a bit, being a 5 year old game, but they get the job done and it's well optimized.  The music is absolutely amazing, and in many aspects I would count it as better than Payday 2's soundtrack.  Rather than dubstep/DnB tracks, P:TH opts for breakbeat loops with emphasis on bass, giving it a lower key but higher overall intensity feeling to the shootouts.  Rather than spending the entire match in a constant shootout with cops regardless if there's an assault in progress or not, the game gives you downtime inbetween assaults, letting the tension build before dropping you into a balls out assault wave from every direction.  It gets you in the mood and honestly keeps me coming back to the game again and again.  I particularly enjoy the Panic Room Theme, which slowly builds up as you fight your way up the derelict apartment building to the saferoom filled with cash.At $15 this game is a steal, the WolfPack DLC is unnecessary but does come with some nice skills and weapons, it's your call though since it's 66% the price of the actual vanilla game.

												So, this is a COOP game from 2011, but since half of these reviews are slow as ♥♥♥♥, I decided to come back and reveal yet another game from the dephts of the past years. I present to you, PAYDAY: The Heist.This game is ♥♥♥♥ ass fun with friends, and not that good when playing solo. PAYDAY: The Heist's synopsis involves 4 professional guys robbing picked out heists. When I first started this game, I was given the benefit of the doubt in thinking that this will be some crappy indie game, even more doubt when I found out the company, Overkill Software, was formed from the directors of GRIN, whom is responsible for one of the worst, most generic games ever made, EVER. I was wrong.GRAPHICSNow, the game doesn't have those top-notch graphics we see, it ponders more to the gameplay, but this section isn't left out. Everything, from the First World Bank, to the No Mercy hospital is enriched in detail, and complexity. Low-res textures are, as much as they can, removed and only when you are some detail-nut who likes to notice things. The game doesn't offer that much of a linear chance, but everything is complex and well-made. There are also some visual filter stuff in the menu I don't use. Bloom ♥♥♥♥, while appearing at some points of a heist, is not excessive and appears only for added realism. All-in all, graphics are pretty good.SOUNDThe sounds, while not perfectly executed, give some needed environments the buff they need. Civilians screaming in terror are probably the most thought out, but the guns don't sound great. For example, the cops shooting their pistol sounds pretty ♥♥♥♥ing weak. And when huge firefights occur, the gun sounds just take a huge ♥♥♥♥ and leave, because everything is just said gun sounds, no bullets whizzings or anything. Doesn't give that much of a scenery if you ask me. The music makes up for it though. It's a mix of rock and electronic, and gives you that adrenaline pump when you need it. Bass rapes the songs at times, but it's still executed to pump you even more.GAMEPLAYNow here is the best part of the game. It really gives it it's substance. You and your buddies go on heists that are picked for you. Prediction is eliminated at this point, because every situation occurs RANDOMLY, and requires you and your team to pick out your loadouts carefully. At the start, you are bestowned with the option to scout out ahead and mark out the plan, which doesn't give the game that immediate action build like the mainstream concurence now-a-days. The only drawback I have on this heisting system is how unreal it is. Seriously, you get like 5000 SWAT officers shoved up your ♥♥♥. WHERE the ♥♥♥♥ do they find this kind of firepower? I am drilling the vault, and a great bunch of police officers appear at an Assault wave ready to buttrape you. Of course, this is all for an intended challenge, but really? You're gonna bring the whole America down on my ♥♥♥? Once you start the heist, you can use the F key to shout at stupid ♥♥♥ civilians who don't listen to you. They also managed to sucessfully find some use out of the keyboard key. You can use that to make officers cuff themselves, mark out special units, and do a ♥♥♥♥♥on of other things. It's amazing how much use one button can do here. Most of the gameplay involves drills and saws that are required, so it may get tedious for you, but the replayability and different scenarios excuse for it it, and gives it more interest the more you play. The A.I, unfortunatley, sucks balls when you play solo, but it can be perfectly understood because this is a CO-OP game and not designed only for you (if in that case you have no friends, ♥♥♥♥♥♥). The game also warrants defending your backs. If you go alone to find some object or ♥♥♥♥, you can guarantee you'll be in custody, unless you're pretty sure you can handle the cops. It's all about thinking and planning everything out as a team. You get a HUGE arsenal for things to prep yourself up too. Silenced UZIs, pistols, 2 shotguns, assault rifles and so much more. If you're a gun-nut, you'll love it. I had some added problems with the difficulties, because it's just police spam all around, and basically redefines the whole meaning of difficult. You need to SERIOUSLY prep up and have some firepower to finish a mission on the highest difficulty. This difficulty is somewhat lowered when the music from earlier kicks in during an Assault wave for adrenaline, and also the added cash, to remind your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ that you have a million bucks waiting for you to roll in.STORYThere is no story for the game, but it has a synopsis. Basically, 4 guys (a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, a Sheffield guy, American and a Swedish) gather around and eventually meet some hacker/whatever called Bain. From then on, it's straight heisting. My favourite guy is Hoxton, the British ♥♥♥♥.This game is what CO-OP should be. While it has some drawbacks, I had kickass time playing it, so I give it an:8.5/10""			"

												I'll tell you what I think alright. What I think is that it's not crap, but GOOD. Why would you not want to shoot up cops and steal money. It's great because in real life this would suicidal so I think this REALLY satisfies your need to kill cops and steal money without real harm. I would recommend this more than Payday 2 because Payday 2 was really a dissapointment for me because like I said in that review the SWAT are way op'ed and your guns are ♥♥♥♥. I rate this game a good 8.8/10 for this game as it's virtual heists really satisfies your bank-robbing needs.Dead Kitty out			"

 So, you wanna rob some banks?  ..... well this is not exactly the case here. If you want a more active, more content (and DLC) filled and more varied game, I suggest you get PAYDAY 2. The issuses surrounding micro-transactions have been dealt with, they have been removed, and community is back to normal. That being said, what do you get from this game  BASIC FEATURES:   Heists (or missions) in which you have to complete certain objectives such as defending a position, or keeping the hostages in check while your team mates gather cash. While there is only one proper ""bank heist"", other missions have a good variety, ranging from heist in a Hospital to escorting a VIP Heist (or missions) can be done solo or with friends/strangers(Recommended) Each heist gives you cash at the end, which is like experience progression system found in RPGs. You earn this by playing well, like headshots etc, helping teammates, and simply completing your objectives. There are three skill trees (fourth being DLC) that you can spend you cash in. Assault, Sharpshooter and Support (Technician in DLC); each with their own unique upgrades.  You select the tree, and you level in that skill as you play. REMARKS * It's pretty well optimized. * Graphics are good enough for a multiplayer game.* Overall gameplay is quite good, with pretty satisfying gunplay. Guns sound really amazing as well.* Music is stellar, with tracks ranging from tense to exhilarating and adds to the experience.* Since there are only a handful of missions, playing them again and again could feel repetitive. Though they have enough variety in their objectives that they don't feel stale, at least for a while. Also, if you play this game in breaks (like playing during weekends only), you wouldn't get bothered by it.  * Unlocking upgrades is a bit tedious, as you need to do quite many missions to get you hands on the good stuff.* Due to the popularity of it's big brother PAYDAY 2, it's sometimes are to find a match, Though, you should not have any problems during the peaks hours. CONCLUSION/HOW MUCH RECOMMENDATION? Overkill (the studio behind it) clearly put much love and effort into the game. But it only seems like a prototype for the much bigger and better PAYDAY 2, which team's passion passion shine. Regardless, this is a fun competent and extremely enjoyable Co-op FPS. If you've not played any online FPS/ played a few online FPS  : While I can point to Team Fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead 2, but if you are interested in a more ""realistic"" game, then I RECOMMENDED it. This is one of the few FPSs which I think neither too complex that it becomes overwhelming, it is not too simple either that it becomes boring. Also, it works quite well on low end PCs and Laptops. But, I also suggest you give PAYDAY 2 (GOTY edition) a shot, if you have a good PC, and extra money for DLCs If you've played a quite many online FPS  : If you like FPSs that are simple and fun divergence, where you don't need to learn the mechanics and intricacies of the systems, you can give it a go. Otherwise, simply go with PAYDAY 2 (GOTY edition).			"

												Nice game! Not just a regular FPS. It combines 4 people to play along together in a sets of missions. I love the gameplay. Just one thing bothers me: ridiciously amount of police, and some f*cked up logic. Who would send a batallion (more than 30) of normal police, SWAT, etc just to take down 4 people? TOO MUCH BLOODBATH/LIVES taken away!Moreover, they are bursting, in a room, or even walk to you in very close. There's no grenade as well. Real SWAT team could've send tear gas/smoke grenade or something. Aside that, the gameplay's okay.			"

At the start, you are bestowned with the option to scout out ahead and mark out the plan, which doesn't give the game that immediate action build like the mainstream concurence now-a-days. The only drawback I have on this heisting system is how unreal it is. Seriously, you get like 5000 SWAT officers shoved up your ♥♥♥. WHERE the ♥♥♥♥ do they find this kind of firepower? I am drilling the vault, and a great bunch of police officers appear at an Assault wave ready to buttrape you. Of course, this is all for an intended challenge, but really? You're gonna bring the whole America down on my ♥♥♥? Once you start the heist, you can use the F key to shout at stupid ♥♥♥ civilians who don't listen to you. They also managed to sucessfully find some use out of the keyboard key. You can use that to make officers cuff themselves, mark out special units, and do a ♥♥♥♥♥on of other things. It's amazing how much use one button can do here. Most of the gameplay involves drills and saws that are required, so it may get tedious for you, but the replayability and different scenarios excuse for it it, and gives it more interest the more you play. The A.I, unfortunatley, sucks balls when you play solo, but it can be perfectly understood because this is a CO-OP game and not designed only for you (if in that case you have no friends, ♥♥♥♥♥♥). The game also warrants defending your backs. If you go alone to find some object or ♥♥♥♥, you can guarantee you'll be in custody, unless you're pretty sure you can handle the cops. It's all about thinking and planning everything out as a team. You get a HUGE arsenal for things to prep yourself up too. Silenced UZIs, pistols, 2 shotguns, assault rifles and so much more. If you're a gun-nut, you'll love it. I had some added problems with the difficulties, because it's just police spam all around, and basically redefines the whole meaning of difficult. You need to SERIOUSLY prep up and have some firepower to finish a mission on the highest difficulty. This difficulty is somewhat lowered when the music from earlier kicks in during an Assault wave for adrenaline, and also the added cash, to remind your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ that you have a million bucks waiting for you to roll in.STORYThere is no story for the game, but it has a synopsis. Basically, 4 guys (a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, a Sheffield guy, American and a Swedish) gather around and eventually meet some hacker/whatever called Bain. From then on, it's straight heisting. My favourite guy is Hoxton, the British ♥♥♥♥.This game is what CO-OP should be. While it has some drawbacks, I had kickass time playing it, so I give it an:8.5/10""			"

												-Amazing plot: rob banks and run around like headless chickens screaming out for Bain.-Real 3D-time technology: drills/saws are so realistic that you find yourself staring at them during the entire heist!-Very motivating rewards: loot cash from banks to spend it on absolutely nothing! Thank you, Overkill.-Infinite playability: ever get bored? Smuggle out the same Chinese prisoner over a hundred times!-Endless action: there's more cops than there are dollar bills in the bank you're trying to rob!-Superb graphics: did I ever mention something about the drills/saws looking like a real piece of art?-Massive supply of guns: really, there must be almost a dozen guns in this game!1!11111!11-Incredibly balanced: as a team of four, absorb over a thousand bullets and take down over thousands of cops! Alone!-Intelligent AI: feel free to solo, having your AI team stare at a wall while you're bleeding out.-Great community: teammates tend to try to shoot a vase while you're trying to sneak your way into the pentagon.-Great community: did I mention the one time my team took the last bit of an ammo bag while I had litterally 0 ammunition left?-Great community: this one guy tried to kamikaze a bulldozer (juggernaut) by slapping it with his wrist.-This community is REALLY great: I love having my game paused for 5 minutes to have someone join then say ""oopss, sry wrng room""-Detailed heists: I had to smuggle a chinese prisoner, tie him up into a chair, lift him up via balloon to have an airplane swoop by and catch it at the exact specific time-frame.-Great community: someone called me a d*** for not reviving him when he has a swarm of cops circled around him.-Bain is god: you don't know where he is, who is his, what he is but you still accept instructions on robbing the national bank from him.After falling off a roof I instantly recovered by grabbing my teammate's hand.420/69 would drill again.

												You will embark on a spectacular crime spree of six heart stopping heists, including blasting their way through a downtown bank vault robbery or managing hostages in an armored car hijacking. It's challenges you with dynamic environments and adaptive enemy tactics. Meaning no scenario will ever play out the same way twice. Teamwork is essential to ensure crew members provide cover under fire, guard key access points, break through various security measures and keep civilians in check. Survive wave after wave of the best that law enforcement can deploy as they shift strategies in response to your actions and style of playing.			"

												If i learnt something from payday is that a simple robbery to a bank, generally ends with a genocide with about 1 million SWAT's and cops that will never return to their homes. However If they capture someone. They will happily trade him for a hostage, so he can continue the massagre giving him all he's weapons and gadgets. Many people dont notice that this isnt a failure of the game, but a strong social critic about the inefficiency about the law. Also its very fun to kill cops 9.5/10			"

												PROs:-Guns feel solid. While the starting stuff can feel a tiny bit weak at first, after getting some upgrades the weapons start to fill out nicely. -Difficult. Its kind of arguable, I suppose, that being difficult is a good thing, but its hard to feel like a winner without having to first travel down the bloodiest, most bullet-filled hell that the higher difficulties on this game can be. -Graphics aren't too bad; that's always a plus. Don't expect anything mind numbing on this front however. -Soundtrack is noice. There can never be enough beep-boops in my game music.-Teamwork is key. Also pretty arugable to be a pro, but there is nothing better in my opinion then completely curbstomping a giant wave of enemies with all of your friends (given that you are good enough). CONs:-The difficulty might push away people who just want a casual experience. Its pretty hard to be casual when its so easy to get downed. Break from cover without thinking on the higher difficulties? Dead. Not taking out Snipers? They will find a way to shoot you eventually. Bulldozer charging you from behind? Good luck with that. -PhysX installer bothers you as you boot up the game. This is fixable, however; just follow this guide:

Basically, I would suggest this game to anyone looking for a difficult experience that rewards you greatly for working as a team, doing objectives, and surviving the hordes of cops that come at you.

												As one of the most classic first person shooter (FPS) games there is in the market today, you get a whole bundle of actions, the fast-paced thrill from the heists where you eventually climb up from the bottom of the pit of noobiness to the world outside the pit where the whole new heist expeirence unfold, the enjoyment when you take down special enemies in a row and then get busted by the last one behind you, the ultimate satisfaction when you and the rest of your crew work seamlessly like a charm and make your plans work.... all packed in one bloody single game called Payday the Heist. Nothing else feels quite like the title when it comes to team collaboration and the fast-paced thrill -- anything could happen and surprise you in the last minute, and these are exactly what make this game deserve playing.There's always a price to pay in terms of getting used to the gameplay, but once you earned your own payday because of the hardwork, nothing pays off more than the sense of achievement, with or without the achivements themselves. This is the game that test your patience in terms of skills, the game that requires you to be dedicated enough to enjoy more and more, the game that needs you to collaborate with the rest of your team constantly, and the game that can be enjoyed both with others and just playing solo, although the difficulty of  the two may vary from one person to another.Is there anything more enjoyable than hearing when the police are shouting to one another that they're retreating becuase of you? >;3 Pros: - team communication system (shouting system) works like a gem, the interactive key (default by F) multitasks so well;- the collaboration system is well designed, the visual icons  and radio heads-up in-game provided for helping players assisting one another works very well;- every map is very unique in their own ways, providing different challenges based on the game difficulty;- the background music is also pretty good (i enjoyed it at least), and they suit the scenario that you're in;- each heist story is well made, pretty realistic-a very focused shooting game that also involves strategy and planning. Cons:- the game sometimes could be a bit buggy, and this could be deadly when the special units are able to shoot you through the wall; - a bit glitchy here and there, and this might ruin your plan for a heist occassionally;- the alarm system feels less realistic than in payday 2 where people are more capable of suspecting you, while here in PDTH even if you're standing face to face in front of a guard, as long as you don't press the key to start the heist, no one will detect you;- skill tree upgrading system could be confusing to some (there's a Tab key you use in game to pull out an overlay, and using the 1-4 number key to select which tree you want to upgrade when you level up next), and there is no way to manually respec, unless you clear the stats history. If you like heist titles and enjoy shooters, i highly recommend you to at least  try out this game, it might not be the easiest shooters you've played, but the rewarding in the end is just as much as the potential difficulty. I got the most sense of satisfaciton from the teamplay in this game, and even if when i'm playing solo, the challenge is there, and it's even more fun to just go try them out and test yourself. A classic that you shouldn't miss. "

												PAYDURR: The HURRR is a game about 4 (four!) special education graduates who decide to rob banks, moms basement, their drug dealers house, and a meat packing plant. They start all of their heists with some dude who has a kickass plan to do everything without a hitch and get away clean, but naturally our downsy antiheroes screw it up by walking in without masks shouting and then shoot police instantly. The heists usually go downhill from there until somebody smacks a drill on something, but being special-ed superstars they cant even get that right, having to go back and hit it several times until they get the drill right. Eventually they go into a vault/safe/moms basement and fill bags with money, leave them on the ground, then run away giddy with the 'millions they totally just made and will never have to work again' which equates to their share of rent at the group home and a few trips to mcdonalds. In summary a more realistic and addictive game than cowadooty. 7/10 would DURR again.			"

												It's a bit weird considering that I came to know the franchise I played the most by 2016, by pirating it's very first game.Payday: The Heist.And when I paid my due (buying the original), it's because this game is just pure awesome!I'm still not of the hook yet, as when Payday 2 came along, I pirated it first until like 10-20 update the game have released, that's when I decide to just buy the original for good to make the enjoyment of the game unhindered by searching the pirated update (it still exist though, iirc)PDTH shines in it's cinematic heist flow and solid gun play, compared to Payday 2 which offer diverse playstyle and ever increasing arsenal and heist location. But Payday The Heist still holds its own as a classic throwback on the game that spark the genre of heisting-with-your-friend.One feature I would surely miss from the recent iteration is the character interaction during heisting. Every heist have some kind of story between the character as it progresses. I hope Payday 2 can aim higher on that department.Sadly, PDTH is bogged down on a number of element.The Heist is more-or-less static, you can only do it one way or a mix of 2 with still the major way basically the same with every heist released in PDTH.Progression system to unlock arsenal, equipment and passive skill is grindy at best. You won't reach the end growth if not clocking more than 50 hour doing the hardest heist getting all objective and loot. So it might turn off some people.There's only 1 game mode, which is heisting. Don't compare it to Left 4 Dead series which have mutator, scavenge, etc. But PDTH relief this by having the heist objective a new and different on each heist. Basically making the heist's objective on the same level with L4D various game mode if I say so.For those of you who came to know Payday 2 first, you won't regret buying this game that spark the genre. It might server as a break from your 1000th hour of Payday 2. It'll feel fresh, trust me.Even better if you can get your other heisting partner in Payday 2 to play along in this.Discount is really generous when it comes to sale.Getting DLC for this is more lucrative, since it ties also to existing Payday 2 DLC, buy 1 to get 2 so to speak.Get ready to begin the story of the original Payday crewAnd it'll not be as easy as Payday 2.Mask up			"

												I bought this game on sale after I had so much fun playing PAYDAY 2, just to see how much PAYDAY 2 changed from PAYDAY: The Heist. I was surprised to find out they are like 2 completely different games!ABOUT THE GAME:Take on the role of a hardened career criminal executing intense, dynamic heists in constant pursuit of the next “big score”PROS:+ Fantastic level design (completely different missions unlike PD2)+ Vast variety of enemy types (cloakers, tasers, shields, dozers, its amazing)+ Can be very challenging and engaging (requires teamwork)+ Unique gameplay mechanics (taking hostages, restarting drills etc)+ Skills and equipment are cool (a little bit lacking of content)CONS:- You can't skip the opening cutscenes (makes repeating missions tedious)- Only a few missions (can make the game feel repetitive)- Interaction times are off (even with skills, restarting drill takes FOREVER)- Stealth mechanics suck (not really much to work with)- Connection problems (they happen often)SUMMARY:The game is a lot more simple than its predecessor PAYDAY 2, but it is still just as fun in it's on way. It is much more loud oriented and doesn't have much stealth in it, but makes working with your teammates to complete tough missions more satisfying.Final Grade:7 / 10 jammed drills			"

												A game I find significantly more entertaining than the sequel. Do beware of some of its issues though. Enemies have divine accuracy, snipers are a nightmare, cloakers give no warning whatsoever and have virtually no OHKO cooldown, and tasers only need to see a small part of your playermodel to taze you and are extremely difficult to shake off single-handedly. The game can be frustrating with bots or incompetent pubs. The difficulty system also works differently than the sequel, with all difficulties capable of providing a challenge.PS: If you buy the game, make sure to get the Wolf Pack and Wolf Pack Weapons DLC. Sentry guns, machine pistols and grenade launchers. What's not to love?PPS: I mentioned the friendly AI before. I cannot stress how absolutely worthless they are. If you play with them with any frequency, you will rip your hair out as it takes them five seconds just to initiate a revive when they're right next to you. There is also no special that will not utterly wreck them. A single Shield trumps all three bots with ease. In other words; when possible, stick with multiplayer.			"

												The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal *bodeboop*. A single lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. *ding* Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start. *Ding!* "

												Really fun! Although I haven't gotten Payday 2, I feel that this game has realistic graphics (not too realistic though, a bit cartoon-ish) , and the gameplay was complete throughout. However, it isn't as easy as you think. Although there are around 3 or 4 objectives in a game/map, you have to either face tons of Assaults moving forward (depending on difficulty), restart drills (an objective), or just hold the fort until the thermite/drill/etc. is done. Despite all these challenges, the game itself is really intense at some point, including stealth and assault missions. 10/10 would play again! :D			"

PAYDAY: The HeistDo heists, kill cops, intimidate members of authority, and force information out of people from the top of businesses. Do what you want, get the job done how you want, and whether you live or die, pass or fail, at least you get to do it all behind a sweet-looking mask of your choice.Use money and experience points to level up and unlock new weapons, skills and masks. Upgrade your perks and skills in the order you want to suit you and your style of playing the game.There are four playable criminals to choose from: Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains. Get money the fun way - and see you at the safe house!8/10Would throw a man out of an airbourne helicopter again. "

												Left 4 Dead 2, but with cops instead of zombies and loot instead of safehouses. Not the best looking shooter, but the gameplay is what makes it so damn good. If you like PAYDAY 2, you'll probably like PAYDAY: The Heist. They're two very different games, with PAYDAY: The Heist being more action oriented and less stealth elements. If you like the heist genre, cops vs. robbers, etc, then you'll adore this game. Happy heisting!			"

												I bought this game on sale after I had so much fun playing PAYDAY 2, just to see how much PAYDAY 2 changed from PAYDAY: The Heist. I was surprised to find out they are like 2 completely different games!ABOUT THE GAME:Take on the role of a hardened career criminal executing intense, dynamic heists in constant pursuit of the next “big score” PROS: + Fantastic level design (completely different missions unlike PD2)+ Vast variety of enemy types (cloakers, tasers, shields, dozers, its amazing)+ Can be very challenging and engaging (requires teamwork)+ Unique gameplay mechanics (taking hostages, restarting drills etc)+ Skills and equipment are cool (a little bit lacking of content) CONS: - You can't skip the opening cutscenes (makes repeating missions tedious)- Only a few missions (can make the game feel repetitive)- Interaction times are off (even with skills, restarting drill takes FOREVER)- Stealth mechanics suck (not really much to work with)- Connection problems (they happen often) SUMMARY: The game is a lot more simple than its predecessor PAYDAY 2, but it is still just as fun in it's on way. It is much more loud oriented and doesn't have much stealth in it, but makes working with your teammates to complete tough missions more satisfying. Final Grade:7 / 10 jammed drills			"

												Ok, i'll try to figure this out. Here is the facts i've come up with this far. 1. You're a robber, thief, or shall i simplify,(i suck at spelling) You do what you do best. YOU take scores.2. The maps of this game is original, in the sense of being inspired by the movie, ""HEAT"".2.1. Actually there is one who is almost identical to the shootout scene, i think it's called ""heat street""? whatever.3. The handling of firearms is very simple, of course, because you're supposed to shoot first, ask questions later.4. You can choose between the characters known as: Hoxton, Wolf, Chains and Dallas. They have their own trait in the terms    of both personality and comfort. For example: If you like slinging drugs, (mostly in PAYDAY 2) stealing the federal cash reserve (maybe that was a bit overkill, he...) while screaming from the top of you'r lungs that you hate special police force units, then you'r choice is Wolf. (He also is described as a psychopath from some of his contacts, moslty bain) He also sees heisting as a game rather than an affordable income.  Hoxton: He's charming, good looking and handles accuracy as well as he's own jokes. Instead of battering on about what a ♥♥♥♥♥torm of bad luck they have, he seems to be havin' fun in the sense of general criminal ambition.  Chains: He thinks of himself as indestructible, mainly because he has cheated death a huge amount of times. Ex military, Hoah! and that kind of ♥♥♥♥. He is also the only black guy in the group. Oh sweet Dallas. He turned two mafia families against one another, and then he went underground. He is the Assault as described by the wiki. (He's the Mastermind in PAYDAY 2) He seems to be the boss when it comes to acts of performance, and planning. He is also dead ♥♥♥♥ing serious about not joking around in the safehouse. 5. CLOAKER!! That's one of the many, many names you'll be shouting out in the middle of chaos. And also: BULLDOZER!!   SHIEEEELD!!    TAAAAAAAAAZEEEEEEEER!!!( Wolf is ♥♥♥♥ scared of these special units, so if you want a laugh, you'll probably pick him)6. The cash in this game is experience, i know sadly. The higher levels you attain with cash, the more you'r arsenal grows.  you'r skill is also affected by this fact. 7. Multiplayer is where this game really shines, that is, if you do not find a ♥♥♥♥-poor performer with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ attitude towards everything and everyone. Hackers included. 8. The feeling you get when beatinga heist depends on the difficulty level. Examples. Hard: Yes!! Great!! Overkill: YEAH!! YEAAAH!!! Overkill +145: *seizure of awesomeness*9. I think that's everything, let me check...yeah i think so. 10. And please, don't let Bain know about this. This is between you and me ok? 11. You know what bain does with traitors...heaaa wtpo,mngowpetks.12. Don't ask anymore questions, thank you.End			"

												PAYDAY: The Heist is not an ordinary FPS shooter. This game is the reason for my avatar on Steam, even. PAYDAY: The Heist is a beautiful combination of variety, interesting replayability, and tons of fun! It is on par with other shooters, yet it retains it's ability to keep you engulfed in becoming from a small-time offender to a hardened career criminal who knows his way around an Overkill 145+ heist.You start off with a simple pistol and assault rifle, your later best friends and life-savers. But as you continue to play more, you'll get more eager to see the heist stand out it's varied script events and interesting turn-outs that will manage to keep you playing for hours with friends, until you probably reach Level 15. From there on, you're on you're on your way to Level 145 (or, for the DLC owners, 193).The gameplay is certainly well done. Repeating myself, it is on par with other popular and mainstream shooters like Call of Duty, but it does not show it at all.  While it can be blamed for being a little too much Left 4 Dead, it is still great. You play as the bad guys this time, and the good guys try to stop you. So, in common sense, what do the bad guys do? Kill them, of course! You can choose to be silent and get out with tons of cash without anyone noticing, or go the idiot's way and blast your way in, guns-blazing. This encourages further teamwork and demands faster reflex so you can make it out alive with the loot you've gotten. The guns are big enough to be embedded in the gameplay. It is of absolute necessity to choose your guns wisely, as a gun in it's wrong scenario can cause a lot of troubles for you and your team. As you continue dominating the map, the police switch tactics, and you must watch your backs from then on, because the police in this game are not dumb. The police will always try to outrun you in terms of tactics, sometimes even try to fool you, as they work in formations and form deadly teams. The Bulldozer is definently something you must avoid. Cloakers play hide-and-seek at times. Tazers are your death sentence if you go alone, and the Shield is a fool that must be fooled most of the time, as they run out trying to kill you instead of watching their backs. The maps are linear and have a touch of exploration. There is NEVER a big part of the map you will not be forced to go to, and it is absolutley not straight. Every map is divided in areas and is large enough for the heist to make you explore the area as you do objectives. Explorating is also encouraged as there are money bundles hidden anywhere. Heat Street is definently rectified, but that is only one heist to challenge you, and it is completely optional!The gunplay is amazing. It has weight to it, unlike other games (cough CoD cough). When you kill a special unit, you'll feel good, because you've just brought down one of the police's top-notch units. And that is not all. Literally, the recoil, the sounds of the guns will keep you livid to kill more cops, as well as confident enough to go in deeper during an Assault wave and slaughter an entire police team. It's also very well-paced.The graphics may not be super high-tech like many other companies aim to do now again, but the environments on some maps are gorgeous and well-executed enough to immerse you. It manages to suceed, even if the game is more enticed on it's gameplay rather than graphics.The audio is superb! The voice acting for Bain and other characters is so good, the yells are powerful, and even the police is listenable and has some interesting quotes. The sound effects for the environments, explosions, and firefights is intense. The explosions sometimes feel weak and feeble, but everything else makes up for it.The leveling is something I have a problem with ONLY. You start off with nothing except a pistol, a perk, and an assault rifle. This makes heisting very hard, as you're practically standing naked. I know this was designed so you can play with higher-leveled friends, but for people who need a boost so they can at least play better and support their team in multiplayer later on, this can be a tad frustrating or tedious, because even Easy can be hard for some players. But in every other aspect, I want nothing changed in this game.PAYDAY: The Heist executes all the moves from games of today, and fits it in one tight, playable package that is sure to keep you enthralled for more. Even if it's sequel, Payday 2, is now a grind-fest, ahem, and inferior game gameplay-wise to this one, I would recommend PAYDAY: The Heist for players looking for something new, fresh and with action.9.5/10			"

												Do you like like co-operative games?If you like the Left 4 Dead series, you will find this game quite familar, yet very different, and possibly much more difficult in some ways.Become a fearless criminal along with three like-minded individuals (or bots) and perform a variety of daring heists that will almost never be the same. This game will pretty much test your First Person Shooter skills as well as the mutual cooperation between your teammates.The relentless police will send everything they got after you, so you won't be able to idle around for long, and have to use the precious time between each assaults to move around, complete your objectives, reload and prepare for the next one.Pick your own gear for each mission. And as level up you gain experience to unlock new weapons, new abilities and new perks to help yourself and your teammates.Be quick, be sharp, be smart, and always remember to stand together. You will find yourself having to rely on your crew to get you out of trouble, so be prepared to learn and do the same as well.Alas, I highly recommend giving this game a try. Its entertainment value, affordable price tag and its interesting co-operative gameplay shouldn't disappoint.Even after years since its release, this game remains a classic. - Friend			"

												PAYDAY: The Heist is a first person shooter that allows players to embark on a spectacular and intense experience of a career criminal.The 6 original heists (First World Bank, Heat Street, Panic Room, Green Bridge, Diamond Heist and Slaughterhouse) provide a variety of approaches to achieve the best payday, including blasting the way through a downtown bank vault, managing hostages in an armored car hijacking and even a midnight infiltration of a high-security facility.This game challenges the player with dynamic environments and adaptive enemy tactics, which means that the scenarios will never be repeated, forcing the player to adapt to different situations every single time.The game features an amazing 4 players cooperative experience, and teamwork is essential to ensure the plan's success.The gameplay is good, the graphics are great in my opinion and the soundtrack is superb, although the AI could be improved.The released content provides 3 amazing new heists (Undercover, Counterfeit and No Mercy) and plenty of fun.I highly recommend PAYDAY: The Heist along with the Wolfpack DLC.

												Left 4 Dead 2, but with cops instead of zombies and loot instead of safehouses. Not the best looking shooter, but the gameplay is what makes it so damn good. If you like PAYDAY 2, you'll probably like PAYDAY: The Heist. They're two very different games, with PAYDAY: The Heist being more action oriented and less stealth elements. If you like the heist genre, cops vs. robbers, etc, then you'll adore this game. Happy heisting!			"

												I bought this game on sale after I had so much fun playing PAYDAY 2, just to see how much PAYDAY 2 changed from PAYDAY: The Heist. I was surprised to find out they are like 2 completely different games!ABOUT THE GAME:Take on the role of a hardened career criminal executing intense, dynamic heists in constant pursuit of the next “big score” PROS: + Fantastic level design (completely different missions unlike PD2)+ Vast variety of enemy types (cloakers, tasers, shields, dozers, its amazing)+ Can be very challenging and engaging (requires teamwork)+ Unique gameplay mechanics (taking hostages, restarting drills etc)+ Skills and equipment are cool (a little bit lacking of content) CONS: - You can't skip the opening cutscenes (makes repeating missions tedious)- Only a few missions (can make the game feel repetitive)- Interaction times are off (even with skills, restarting drill takes FOREVER)- Stealth mechanics suck (not really much to work with)- Connection problems (they happen often) SUMMARY: The game is a lot more simple than its predecessor PAYDAY 2, but it is still just as fun in it's on way. It is much more loud oriented and doesn't have much stealth in it, but makes working with your teammates to complete tough missions more satisfying. Final Grade:7 / 10 jammed drills			"

												If you have any idea of what anything is, you should already know that Payday the heist is a four player co-op FPS. In which you rob stuff.You take the role of 1 of the 4 clowns in the payday crew, hitting banks, armoured transports, and more. This game is just fun to play, but frustrating at a few moments, just play it smart and you should stay out of trouble.Payday the heist feels like it's younger brother, Payday 2, so if you like Payday 2, this game is more of that and vice versa. It's not like they're exactly the same though, here are some notable differences:In PD:TH the heisters directly interact with bain, which makes bain that bit more likeable, instead of just the guy that nags at you.Cash is pretty much experience, when in the sequel it's two seperate things.Singleplayer actually works in PD:TH, since the companion AI revives you if you're down.The upgrade system is more simple and linear.There are much less weapons in PD:TH than there are in PD2, but that means you can decide what weapons you want alot easier.Overall, I have fun playing this game. I recommend it to anyone who likes co-operative fps games, because overkill sure kicks ♥♥♥ at making those.			"

												Much better than Payday 2. It lacks some features such as more advanced stealth and skill trees from Payday 2 but the gameplay is much better. There are no micro-payments, no skins. Just you, your buddies and your gun. Also, the difficulty is much higher, you actually have to be good at the game to play on Overkill difficulty! And no OP DLC will help you overcome that problem. Speaking of DLC. there is only one availible, and it adds much more than so called ""DLC's"" or money grabs in PD2. It adds 2 new heists, new unlocks, new weapons and the best part is that if your friends don't have the DLC maps they can still play with you if one player has the DLC! The levels are challenging and fun, the gameplay feels more tactical and Co-Op focused. I strongly reccomend this game over the ""sequel"".			"

												This game is fantastic! If anyone is thinking about buying this then get it! It is one of those few games that make you feel rewarding and make you want to do more things. Payday The Heist is about four guys, Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains. You get to choose who you want to paly as and what heist you want to do. As you play and beat heists you will get money which is what you use to level up your class. There are 3 (4 if you get the DLC) classes that you get to level up. Each class has different weapons, crew bonuses and bags. The difficulty of the heists depend if you want to just have a normal experience. Overkill if you want to go hard. And easy which is only for the two heists for people who just started playing the game. Over all, this game is a fantastic FPS. If you are choosing to buy which Payday to buy first, get this one for starters. And remember, SHOOT THE BULLDOZER IN THE FACE!			"

I was so happy when it finished loading, so whenn it was done loading and i pushed the play button and a message said preparing payday the heist and then it just crashed and i was so distrought over paying $16.00 to buy a game that wouldnt even work not to mention the devlopers got a PAYDAY and i got a game that doesnt work.

Yeah sure it's a bit old, but that's because most devs don't pay attention to their old games, but us gamers do. It has very positive effects of skills, weapons, missions and masks. Although the stealth IS a bit dumb, after all it wasn't made to be stealthy, it's still fun. I recommend this game purely because the community cares about it, plus it is fun as hell with friendos!

												Overall, this is a very fun game. The missions are quite balanced and give you a sense of accomplishment after making it to the end. Level design is varied and interesting. You have the ability to change your masks each round - something that most other games would charge extra for via DLC. The No Mercy tie-in with L4D is pretty spiffy as well. This is not a Counter-Strike clone by any means.The ONLY drawback is trying to play by yourself is near impossible for some missions. You quite literally cannot complete all tasks. Why? Because your computer-controlled teammates CAN shoot the enemies, but they CANNOT complete any of the mission objectives. You will be the one placing the saw, scooting the hostage along, placing the C4, etc. While this is possible in some missions, it is near impossible in others. For these, you MUST be playing with human players (and preferably ones that know what they are doing). :)Graphics 9/10Gameplay 10/10Sound/Voices 8.5/10Overall 9/10 - Worth every penny!			"

												There are few co-op only FPS titles. Even L4D has ""infected vs survivors"" mode. My first impression of Payday was ""juggalo FPS""; that alone made me NOT want to play it. Indeed, I always pick the raptor mask. If you hit Level 145 (ha!), you get the President masks from Point Break!See, this is a grand homage to robbery heists in contemporary crime drama cinema. The levels consist of a multitude of objectives, with a bit of randomness at points. Co-op here means more than Team DM. You NEED the voice chat, preferably with friends, and you need 4 people. Even then this game WILL kick your ♥♥♥. If you don't coordinate with everyone AND plan things right, you WILL lose. Sure, you keep your XP (gain levels, get perks/guns/etc), but the devs keep adding content for the higher difficulties! I wish they'd make a tutorial. Mechanics aren't tricky, but you gotta figure out a lot.Shooting zombies, Nazis, & aliens is getting old. Shooting THE PO-LICE is where it's at. Especially with THIS music.			"

												Payday the Heist it the grand sucessor, which Payday 2 is a sequel. Payday 2 players might find Payday THe heist a bit too chalenging since Payday 2 has the dificulty set to ♥♥♥♥♥ mode. The Gameplay: The Gameplay is simpler but a lot more fun than Payday 2. Of course the drills still break down,but three weapons, crew bonuses, insta upgraids in heists if you level up and much much more keeps it betterThe Graphics: The graphics engine is good only the masks look ugly as ♥♥♥♥ in game. Nothing else really. The graphics ain't Payday 2 ofcourse but it's up there.THe Sound: The sound in the game is amaizing. From the talking of bank customers and employes to the SWAT radio chatter sounds realistic. The Soundtrack is up there with the best soundtracks of 21st centurie: Hotline Miami and Mirrors Edge are a bit better tho.All in all I rate this game Scarlet Johansen aka 10/10 \( ͡° ͜ʖ (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/ ͜ʖ ͡°)/ʖ ͡°)/ "

												The PAYDAY crew are here to rob banks, houses and hospitals.Featuring a colourful and funny cast of varying countries of origin and personalitiesHoxton the funny and my personal fav character from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England.Dallas the calm, collected American member of the group and refered to by most as the group leader.Wolf the psychopathic member of the group, from Vallentuna, Sweden.Chains another american who is ex military and this games support.The game is incredibly fun and like its sequel is full of re-playability and brilliant gameplay, I personally love the co-op in this game and its a great way to spend time with friends and have a good laugh .9/10			"

												Payday The Heist. In my opinion, one of THE best tactical co-op FPS out there. Yeah sure it's a bit old, but that's because most devs don't pay attention to their old games, but us gamers do. It has very positive effects of skills, weapons, missions and masks. Although the stealth IS a bit dumb, after all it wasn't made to be stealthy, it's still fun. I recommend this game purely because the community cares about it, plus it is fun as hell with friendos!

												Watch law enforcers die at the hands of four experienced bank robbers: Wolf, Hoxton, Chains and Dallas, guided by the super-villain Bain. Kill cops with ridiculously unrealistic machine guns, assault rifles, pistols, SMG's, shotguns, and rifles, drill things with $2.00 drills (even though bain makes millions (srsly buy better drills)), fill bags with stuff, deploy doctor bags, watch your reputation steadily increase until you are a pro, set up explosives and teke funny screenshots under the reasonable graphics and original forehead-sweating heists.97/43Would drill gates again.

												GAYDAY™ The Heist lets you become a professional gun toting manchild who aims to become the best there ever was in robbing banks. Gotta' Rob 'em All and Gotta Catch All the Gay Clown Masks, because once you're a demi-god capable of dispatching an entire city's worth of cops on a daily basis and having illicitly gained enough cash to buy a European country outright, it's hard to aspire to anything else sensible. Some scientific experts claim that these dashing rogues gain their powers from the high-octane soundtrack playing on their iPods during every heist, but Dumb♥♥♥♥ City Police Commander in Chief Barry Fat♥♥♥♥son denies these findings, citing that his task force's repeated gruesome failures is attributed to a grander plan of luring the criminals into a false sense of security. This reporter, however, firmly believes that Commander Fat♥♥♥♥son is clearly a slobbering dumb♥♥♥♥.Back to you, Wilson!			"

												Pro's- You get new weapons each time you level up. - It almost never gets boring playing the same mission.- Co-op is available, so you get to play with other people or buds.- Although this game isn't recent, OVERKILL made a new game as a sequel to this. (Payday 2, so more gaming is available).Con's- When someone is joining your game. (Already started) You'll have to wait a few. (Depending on their internet connection.) But you can disable that.- Payday The Heist isn't getting updated due to the recent game that OVERKILL released (Payday 2).In general, this game is awesome, and very fun to play with others.

												This game is the 4-player co-op Left 4 Dead wanted to be!While in Left 4 Dead we were promised to get changing missions and alternative ways to finish them, they always stay the same - beside the different spawn(rate/places) of the enemies. In Payday the missions change: in lower difficulties only in details, but in higher ones you sometimes get other objectives.You get a nice set of different Heists to fullfil. Even a big homage to its main inspiring model Left 4 Dead by giving you the opportunity to play the non-canon events that leads to the outbreak of the infection.If you like such 4-player co-op games with real teamwork you should give this game a try!Not to forget it is a nice 'gun porn'. ;-)			"

												Great team based game. Fun levels and really challenging. The guns start off pretty bad, you miss point blank some how, but as you level up classes you upgrade them. To all good games, there must be some bad obviously. The AI are more stupid than dirt.. You run to the next objective, turn around, they are outside getting sniped.They are really slow to picking you up, so 1 small mistake with people (like say, getting hit by a cloaker) can be a huge mistake with AI teammates. Because they will run head first into him too..Also, on First World Bank there is a annoying glitch my and my friends keep falling into. Where you randomly slip through the floor and get stuck in walls. No way out as far as I can see.. 


So Overkill is like Valve and doesn't fix their bugs? All I did was Melee a cop and fell through the level and kept falling.

 <--- What I mean.Also, this isn't a stealthy game.. They have Diamond Heist which is my favorite, where you sneak around hacking alarm boxes, but hardly stealthy since you have a 50% chance of still triggering the alarm.Now if you don't mind not stealthy, wanna just chop down swat team and show the cops who is incharge, buy this game. I like Stealthy games, but this is still amazing to play.8/10-2 because the FWB glitch, and how terrible the AI are.. Worst than l4d bots. lol.			"

												I just regret not buying it sooner!!Its an epic game, but there is no fun in it if you play alone..You need your buddies to watch your back and they need you to do the same..So, its an awesome & intense coop shooter game that needs some skills & is pure fun!!If you still dont own it, then buy it and play it with your buddies, its worth the money..Looking forward to buy Payday 2!P.S. Its main menu music is AWESOME!!!!!Peace V			"

												If you have friends to play with, this is probably one of the best co-op games on the PC market right now - not including PAYDAY 2. On almost every map you have a choice - do it quietly or loudly. The first option is saving your bullets and blood for some time, obviously. This game has some RPG elements ( like leveling and three classes - fourth class can be obtained by buying a DLC ). You level up by getting money ( money = exp points here ), which is nice. Every class has other weapons that can be unlocked by just playing. I played every possible not-dlc level and I had great time playing the game. I would rate it 8/10 though for not that much weapons and heists.			"

												Among the best games I've ever played. Fast paced, four player co-op, awesome weapons, and a ton of random variables in each heist that you have never seen, even after 100 hours of gameplay, and pop-up for the first time. It is with faults, and sometimes the logic makes absolutely no sense, but it is still an amazing game. It's like Left 4 Dead meets SWAT.			"

												At least this game doesn't have a couple dozen paid DLC packs, the last few of which are pathetic cashgrabs. At least this game doesn't have microtransactions a couple years after they promised it wouldn't. This game was in a time before Overkill decided it would be great to nickel and dime their loyal fanbase. This game, wasn't ruined by a greedy man named Almir.I supported Payday 2 for a very long time, and had previously never touched this game before due to getting a PC after this game was already left behind. Looks like now is a good time to start and see what it was like in a time before shelling out DLC and microtransactions like they were the latest drug.			"

												This game is clearly superior to its sequel, only problem with it is that not many people play it anymore.Pros:-It is more challenging than it's sequel.-Even if they are few,the heists are better.-The AI isn't that great,but this isn't necesarilly a bad thing,the cops will just try to overwhelm you with their numbers and keep in mind that you cannot hear the cloackers in this game.-The game is simple when it comes to weapons and skills.(this may be a con to some)Cons:-They put no effort at all in the stealth element. The diamond heist is totally random and the guards seem to be deaf to footsteps-The diamond heist. It is frustrating how you can stealth everything and when you reach to the vault the codes won't work and  the alarm will be activated and this is totally random everytime.Sometimes the codes work, sometimes they don't.-Has few players left.-Still have a few bugs here and there.

Its much more fast, and requires more ""movement"" in the sense that a lot of the heists are ones that you'll need to move to different locations to complete them. It also has a great replay value just like the sequel. I recommend this to anyone who has the sequel already, as for everyone else I would recommend getting the PAYDAY 2 first just in case you don't enjoy this one.			"

												I wasn't much of a Payday player to be honest... Yet after playing and enjoying so much payday 2 I started thinking that Payday The Heist... which started everything, should be rather good.I am honestly playing more Payday the Heist, more than I'm playing Payday 2, not for the graphics, but the game itself, it's harder. That's it actually, cops are smarter, weapons work better actually, missions are way better (surely if payday the heist had the ammount of missions payday 2 has people would still be playing it as much as they play the 2nd) and tougher, I'm enjoying The Heist much more than payday 2.

I'm not saying the game is bad the games is pretty good. With Payday 2 coming out 2 years later this game would've pretty fun for back then. Being an indie company and the game insipred from Batman the Dark night opening scene where the joker robs the bank (you can now do in pd2) this game is really fun. Although the drill is stronger than most high school relationships it's pretty much a drill made in china. There is the no mercy hospital which i found to be the coolest of the missions.

												Heisters, put your gloves and lets hit the bank!.Payday The Heist puts you in the shoes of 4 bank robbers, Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains. You'll complete several missions involving bank heist (duh), diamond robbery's, drug dealers, or even blood transplants!. You have to survive waves of cops, swats and special enemies in an attempt to stop you and your 3 teammates. However, you don't have a large amount of weapons and gadgets to fight, but its not that much of a problem.  The game could be unforgiving and it's very hard in higher difficulties.The graphics aren't great but they are not bad, sound assets are quite good and animations are great. Sometimes, A.I is dumb , especially your A.I teammates. Yes, you can play this on singleplayer, but you won't get the same experience as in multiplayer, so if you want to play this game properly, get 3 friends and start having fun.The game doesn't feature a campaign, so I only recommend this if you're going to play multiplayer (the multiplayer missions are the same but with a better game experience). The music fits very well on every situation. The only big problem I could see in this game is the fact that it can get very repetitive very soon, as it only feature like 6 missions and they play the same way almost every time you replay them.

												My crew and I have entered the bank and scoped the place out. Two of them find the bank manager, who has the keycard that we need; while I wait in queue at the tellers, and another teammate is upstairs with a view of the whole room.PRO:+ As a nice touch, killing civilians is a big no-no+ Your respawn timer is longer for each civilian you’ve killed.+ There are even some special police that require you to work together(co-op) to take down.+ Upgrades opening up as you gain reputation levels by collecting money+ It's even fun when you fail a mission and have to strategize with your team to figure out how to do better next time.+ Payday has some of the best music at the start and end of its heists that I’ve heard in a while.CONTRA- A major lack of communication- I had to use a Steam Forum to find out how upgrade system works- During the heists, there are a lot of objectives where you have to wait for something, but the game doesn’t always tell you how long you have to wait for.CONCLUSION:Stealing stuff has never felt this cool.

												I was playing this game long time ago,on a pirate version,and now got it on Summer Sale 2014.I didnt enjoy it so much,when i was playing offline on pirate version,but now with friends,its so much better experience!I was playing PD2 a lot since now,because its also a good game,but requires more player skill than this one.+Verry easy to start playing,cuz you dont have much to care about.You got weapons,time on drill and hordes of cops,so what else you need in a robbery game :D+Does not require much time to level up and gain upgrades and peks for player.You also can upgrade any ""tree"" because at a point you will have all the skills in each tree.(sorry if im wrong at this part,didnt play the game so much)+A lot of fun with friends+Diference between dificulty levels is realy nice,since it truley awards players with more cash ;-) +Very replayable.I played in most part First World Bank mission,because i like it the most,and i didnt get bored,because i always gor something new for leveling up,new weapons,mods for them,new equipment,its upgrades armor upgrades,crew bonuses and other cool stuff.+Kind of hard achievements,wich make some kind of special ""mission"" for me and friends.+Chalenges for weapons and different actions,which award with money.This is even cooler because that makes some sense in changing your loadout.-Sometimes Specials are kind of owerpowered,for example Tasers are just a pain in the @ss if i were running around with locomotive and then get tased from middle of nowhere,and my friends are too far to help,or im just in wrong place.I cant blame anyone but myself,but sometimes they get realy annoying.-Graphics in general are not that BAD, but guys look at those masks,they are so low-poly and low-res textured,that cool looking heisters (in theory) look kinda....meh.Stock masks in PD2 are much better and look the way how it was suposed to be.-Shoot indicator.Sometimes is hard to realise where da hell from cops shoot at you.The screen just gets kind of red,but no indication of where are you been shot from.(Yes i now its not CoD but c'mon guys,wheni get shot from back and cant realise that its really sad)At final i would say the game is not bad,but i wouldnt recomend buying it at full price.Better wait for a sale or discount from Overkill,which they do quite offen,along with free PD2 weekends.P.S. Dont forget to buy Wolfpack DLC whic adds quitre cool stuff in the game.Hope this helps someone ;-)			"

												The first Payday is a solid 4 player co-op FPS. I think it's better than Left 4 Dead in some ways. I prefer the graphical style and gameplay in this to the L4D series. Loads of stuff to unlock as you level up your character and plenty of challenges to complete in either single or multiplayer. Its been overtaken now by its successor, but remains a very playable game. Although clearly not designed as a single-player game, I think its still pretty good as a single-player game, better than L4D single-player IMO.			"

Including an awesome variety of heists, a powerful soundtrack composed by Simon Viklund, many random events providing an excellent replay value, such a great difficulty, some new content recently added with the DLC.

												I played Payday 2 before i played Payday 1 and the games feel very differet. Graphics and some aspects of gameplay make this game not quite payday like payday 2 did. I'm not saying the game is bad the games is pretty good. With Payday 2 coming out 2 years later this game would've pretty fun for back then. Being an indie company and the game insipred from Batman the Dark night opening scene where the joker robs the bank (you can now do in pd2) this game is really fun. Although the drill is stronger than most high school relationships it's pretty much a drill made in china. There is the no mercy hospital which i found to be the coolest of the missions.

												The first Payday is a solid 4 player co-op FPS. I think it's better than Left 4 Dead in some ways. I prefer the graphical style and gameplay in this to the L4D series. Loads of stuff to unlock as you level up your character and plenty of challenges to complete in either single or multiplayer. Its been overtaken now by its successor, but remains a very playable game. Although clearly not designed as a single-player game, I think its still pretty good as a single-player game, better than L4D single-player IMO.			"

												One of the best co-op games ever, IMO (Just behind Left 4 Dead 2).Pros:Lots of fun with friendsGood graphicsGood level design and objectivesAwesome soundtrackLikeable characters (Hoxton is my favourite)You can invite your friends to the DLC heists even if they don't own the DLC themselvesCons:Lots of grinding to level up and unlock upgradesNot many people play this game now since the release of PAYDAY 2Still, I would highly recommend this game if you have friends that enjoy co-op games.

												This game has brilliant game play along with beautiful graphics. Absolute stunner! The online is surprisingly good. The level up system is easy to increase your level, the weapons depend on your Rep (level). There are  many different weapons to choose, the support pack is useful for you and your team mates. The down sides are online players, some will kick you if you are a low level. So be prepared to rage a lot. I would recommend using the private match feature, feel free to invite me.			"

												This game is an amazing co-op shooter for a very moderate price. It's reasonably easy to learn, and yet takes quite a bit of practice to master the top difficulty!The two main goals of the game is to complete heists, and by doing so, earn ""reputation"" (XP) to unlock new weapons and gear, and upgrades for those weapons and gear. There's also plenty of challenges to keep you busy long after you hit max level! The Wolfpack DLC adds a new set of stuff, and also two new heists, so is well worth it. (Note: you can still join a game that's hosting a DLC map if you don't own the DLC, but you need to own the DLC to host those maps yourself)So buy this game, steal money, level up, and maybe, just maybe, you can get golden masks, if you're good enough. ;)			"

Here are the pros of the game- Great music to enjoy while killing cops- Plenty of missions to do, which never get boring (Honestly, that ones an opinion.)- Ways to stealth this game (Heck, It might not be as good as the Payday 2 Stealth but eh, not bad0- Plenty of unique masks (A santa mask? What!?)- Two words. Lag. Free.And now we go onto the cons of the game.- The A.I is a bit useless, which makes this game kinda force multiplayer- It's a bit too easy (Seriously, Payday 2 gives much more challenges)- Repetative (I know I said about how it never gets boring, but it's quite repetative.)Well. I hope people who are reading this enjoy the game. And my terribleness as a review writer here. Anyways.

What is PAYDAY:The Heist and why should I get it ?PAYDAY: The Heist is a fantastic game, and it's 10 times better with friends. Personally, I think the new Wolf Pack DLC is worth it, as you get new weapons and gadgets (including a sentry gun and grenade luancher). The game might not look as stunning as PAYDAY 2, but in my own personal opinion, it is a tad bit better. You better be wary of hackers though, they lurk in the deepest depths of the servers. Intense combat and interesting heists, there's never a dull moment. Unless your trying to repair a drill with half your crew lying on death's frontdoor. The game has many pro's, but it's not perfect.Pro's You get exactly what you paid for. Wide viriaty of weapons, gadgets, heists and enemies. Extremely satisfying gameplay. 4 playeble characters each with a set of unique masks. Skill trees (Assualt / Sharpshooter / Support / (DLC) Technician). Amazing soundtrack. Smooth textures, the laws of gravity apply to objects most of the time. You can cause law enforcers to surrender and cuff themselfs. Actually have to plan instead of mindlessly storming in, gun blazing. Or you can just plan to storm in mindlessly, gun blazing, BUT in a fashionable order. You have to take hostages to trade in your friends from custody (if they die or are cuffed) Good enemy A.I.Con's You need human players to interact with objectives, take hostages, grab money ect. Bad ally A.I. I'll understand if the drill jammes one or two times but jamming almost 5 times per heist is rediculous. Heroic civileans get in the crossfire between you and the feds. I don't know if this is a glitch but you can revive and use explosive/medical/ammo bags through walls. Cloakers are one hit kills, bieng able to incapitate/cuff you with a simple kick. Stealthing is nearly impossible without a legitemate team that communicate. Paintings fall on top of trip mines and render them useless. Those same painting's have somekind of superpower of not moving once shot again. Feds are on steriods, they never get tired when scaling buildings or parkouring from roof to roof. No awesome music while stealthing. Hackers, hackers everywhere.... Bugs that cause people to become Hoodini or something, bieng able to shoot a law enforcer, than they take a one-way ticket to space, Shooting a law enforcer and then they swan dive through objects, or getting downed and glitch under the map.Conclusion.I highly recommend this game if you have friends to play it with, and if you really want to, then you can add me to join you. The excitement of getting away with 25,000,000 $ feels amazing, but the suspense builds up to that last moment where you just need to get to the escape vehicle.... Now two things can happen at this point: A. You make it and then you're, well, as Bain puts it ""We're set for life guys"" and B. You can get horifically murderd by swarming cloakers, bulldozers, or the Tazer-brigade. This is a must have for anyone that likes to plan, play, execute and succeed if you play with a team of friends. The last time I checked this game isn't getting updated anymore, but it's good as it is. ""Speed is key"" a wise irishman once said, but that only applies to Heat street. The best way to go is ""Sneaky-beaky like"". If you have $15 dollars to spare, then be sure to pick this up and join me in my quest to steal cash/gold/blood/diamonds/cash molds. ~~Ashe~~ "

There is a lot of farming involved with leveling up, but as you farm, your character gets better and you get more improved weapons. There is never a dull moment. Due to the randomization of the enemy spawn locations, no two levels are exactly the same. A guard could burst through a door in a level where that never happened before. The game keeps you on the edge of your seat, and it has the classic effect of making you want the rage quit once you die. However, the main setback of this game is that the AI (or your teammates) are absolutely terrible. They run about as fast as a rabbit with two broken legs, and you have to stop sprinting in order for them to keep up with you. Also, when you are down and are bleeding out, you usually have to shout out to them in order for them to actually come to your aid. But, setting this drawback aside, if you have friends to play with, the game will still be a fantastic co-op experience.My overall rating for this game will have to be an 8/10. It's not the best game in the world, but it is FAR from being the worst.			"

												Going back to play Payday The Heist after a haitus of of playing Payday 2 you see a solid game on par with the sequel, The Heist excels in everything it goes to accomplish except possibly Animations, But this was an early title for the company off the Xbox 360 so one would make a few exceptions for it looking a little stiff, What you come to see is an expertly crafted Horde Shooter with the horde being Common Cops to Swat that are hell bent to take you out on every heist you go on by throwing numbers over fire power at you in an attempt to take your gang and yourself out, On the flip side your set out with a standard pistol, and assault rifle to work towards unlocking other weapons and upgrade them by unlocking more for it to continue to progress yourself by taking money as a main replacement for XP, The game features 9 Heists with entirely different scenerios for each with each having their own enviorment to work in giving you room to breath and room for the cops to come at you, If your wondering if Payday: The Heist is worth checking out after playing Payday 2 and having enjoyed it then you will most likely enjoy this as well, It holds up to be on par in the same aspect as L4D1 is to L4D2 since both titles share the same systems and enemies.The Game has 1 DLC in the form of the Wolf Pack, It includes 2 Heists a new Tree for unlocks [Weapons/Skills] and that's the extent, While seeming limited on the surface it is worthwhile to look towards getting this DLC on sale, Or simply with your purchase since it offers 2 compitent and well made maps that offer more to the expierence, Aswell as it gives you DLC for the second title Payday 2 in a similiarly named Wolf Pack that includes the same Maps and a Grenade Launcher  with a special Nail Gun as a melee.Note: The Heists for The Heist are currently being ported over to Payday 2, While being similiar they often take twists on the old maps to make them better, Or simply update them as they take them over, If your willing to wait eventually all the heists from 1 will be in 2 at some point, Currently there's 4/9 Heists on 2 as of this review.TL:DR: Payday: The Heist is a solid game and worth your time if your looking for something to play from time to time in the form of a horde shooter, It is on par with Payday 2 and holds up as it's own.

Grab 3 friends while you plan and execute the heist of your dreams (six in all!) Unlike those zombies in L4D, these cops shoot BACK, so prepare for some hijinks on the run with all that loot!

												Badass game. Personally, I think the graphics are perfect along with the heists. The heists in this game are pretty much easy, I even did OVERKILL with one friend. Good price for this game. Payday: The Heist in my opinion is much better than Payday 2. The Payday 2 heists are short while in Payday 1 these heists can take up to 20-30 minutes, on normal. So, enough said, if you want an amazing cheap action game, get this game. Trust me, it will be worth your $$$$$			"

												Payday: The Heist........Great game overall and all round fun but let's get real about this.....I'm a robber who has earned millions already and now I'm robbing a bank.....Why can't I just get a decent drill to get the vault or whatever open. Sure it's part of the game but it get's to the point where you can't get decent drills.        Let's talk about the game and it's good parts. It's a fun game with friends esspecially the Diamond Heist Mission as you can do it all stealth mode and it's fast and easy and get's you a ton of cash. It maybe hard playing with other players online as there's a lack of communication but when you're playing with mates it's fun, suspenseful and rage inducing at times.         Overall, Payday: The Heist is a classic Cops Vs Robbers game where it's fast paced when you have to escape, suspenseful when you're going stealthy and the tension builds up as a ton of SWAT swarms around you when you're waiting for the drill to finish. 5 Star game with a few  downsides but none the less it's an amazing game with friends to play. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for an action packed game with mates.-ŁogiX™			"

												Ahh... Feels like a old memory coming back!Like an old memory of doing the so called ""Overdrill"", shooting those buldozers in the face and draining the life out of cloakers before they do. Payday: The Heist has been (and still is) my favorite game. Why? Bank heists, robberies, illegal work and ofcourse - shooting. This game is like an arcade to me, where you can play 6 levels over and over again. Altrough  the new Overkill's game - Payday2 is out, I've been playing that more than Payday: The heist, but I still think that the original Payday is closer to my heart.""Stay frosty, gang"" ~Bain 2011/2014 :chains:			"

												It is a pure and simple FPS with those basic commands that we 've met players of this genre. Shoot, if copper works as a team to take down the enemy in the eye and sends bullet ammo again. It's a simple game mechanics, with standard gameplay that appeals greatly. I did not see difficulties or weaknesses in this regard. Beautiful graphics, no harm done. But the biggest storylines of the usual FPS is that you are the good guy. Go there and do good deeds, saves the day, saves the world. You can also be a criminal, which is part of a top-secret organization or fight in a place far away, for reasons unknown to the character. You are a common greedy villain of the big city. Your goal is to get out at predefined sites performing robbery ( as the name ' heist ', which means assault says ) with his group organized in co-op (online or with artificial intelligence). There are goals in the game, it's not just arrive and shouting "" hands up ! "" ( ! ) In the first phase, for example, before giving voice assault, it is advisable to find the bank manager to access a key that is required during this phase. That done, you have another set of goals that involve illegal activities to be performed for the success of the ' bad guys ' you control. While time passes, the police will appear at various levels. Securities local, public police, special police and SWAT Then the beast will catching! The peculiarity of the game is exactly this. Political correctness in the modern world totally left out. While in other shooters already see this, but not on this scale, not directly involving civil and common areas of the big city as banks. The downside of the game is that everything becomes repetitive at some point. The missions are basically all the same, just a different location. Your goal is always to kill and rob, kill and rob. There is nothing else to do throughout the game. After that, the only way to get fun again he is playing cooperatively with friends. For me, playing with friends always makes a "" revival "" in the game, especially when some of them have not played the game.Positives:    Simple graphics but well made ​​;    Proposal unusual storyline ;    Well organized Multiplayer multitasking ;    Nice and friendly gameplay .Negative    Repetitive game ;    Few game modes ;    Weak artificial intelligence.

												- many cheaters- sometimes AI- more and more players start play payday 2 +/- bugs (It´s up to you if you use it or not like: Helping your downed friend through the wall)+ Prize and also DLCs (only 2)+ 4 characters, and each with funny quotes+ a lots of different types of masks+ COOP for 4 players+ 145 levels (193 with DLC)+ weapons, crew bonuses, bags ( - less than in PAYDAY 2)+ many types of law forces+ steam adds (interesting achievements, trading cards, statistics etc.)So, I am very big fan of this Coop game, where you take a role like one of the 4 robbers (Dallas, Hoxton, Chains and Wolf). You start with M4 and M9 pistol like level 0 (there is reputation, not level) and you will stealing jewelery, gold or money in 8 maps (with DLC). Yeah, the true is that if you played PAYDAY 2 I think you won´t like it, cause here´s only a few weapons and upgrades, bonuses, and not a RPG part like in payday 2. But If you won´t play PAYDAY 2 or If you was big fan of Payday 2 and you wanna take a look How our group looks before Hoxton gets to Prison you should buy it. All in all: 92%			"

												Payday the Heist is the prequel of Payday 2 (duh) and I can honestly say, the heist in this game was much much much better than Payday 2.  Clearly a lot of thought process was put by the developers when designing the game (They were inspired from the movie ""the heat"") Every heist that you attempted have failed in one point or another and ""clearing"" every single heist is actually an accomplishment.  Yes, every single one of them is hard. unlike payday 2, where you complete the heist and goes ""meh"".In Payday the Heist, normal mode is actually Overkill mode in Payday 2. Yes, I am serious, it's that hard. So you shall give yourselves a medal if you ever complete every single one of them. Gameplay wise and other stuffs overall was perfect.Still, Kudos to Almir and Overkill studios for this awesome game. 10/10			"

												A very fun game full of catchy music, destruction, unique-ness (Is that a word?) And much more which even followed a sequel which took the good things of this game, and tweaked the bad things. But eh. This is a payday the heist review.Anyways. Here are the pros of the game- Great music to enjoy while killing cops- Plenty of missions to do, which never get boring (Honestly, that ones an opinion.)- Ways to stealth this game (Heck, It might not be as good as the Payday 2 Stealth but eh, not bad0- Plenty of unique masks (A santa mask? What!?)- Two words. Lag. Free.And now we go onto the cons of the game.- The A.I is a bit useless, which makes this game kinda force multiplayer- It's a bit too easy (Seriously, Payday 2 gives much more challenges)- Repetative (I know I said about how it never gets boring, but it's quite repetative.)Well. I hope people who are reading this enjoy the game. And my terribleness as a review writer here. Anyways. Total score?7.8+ Great fun for friends- A.I is mostly useless+ Great music+ Continued a great sequel- Repetative			"

What is PAYDAY:The Heist and why should I get it ?PAYDAY: The Heist is a fantastic game, and it's 10 times better with friends. Personally, I think the new Wolf Pack DLC is worth it, as you get new weapons and gadgets (including a sentry gun and grenade luancher). The game might not look as stunning as PAYDAY 2, but in my own personal opinion, it is a tad bit better. You better be wary of hackers though, they lurk in the deepest depths of the servers. Intense combat and interesting heists, there's never a dull moment. Unless your trying to repair a drill with half your crew lying on death's frontdoor. The game has many pro's, but it's not perfect.Pro's You get exactly what you paid for. Wide viriaty of weapons, gadgets, heists and enemies. Extremely satisfying gameplay. 4 playeble characters each with a set of unique masks. Skill trees (Assualt / Sharpshooter / Support / (DLC) Technician). Amazing soundtrack. Smooth textures, the laws of gravity apply to objects most of the time. You can cause law enforcers to surrender and cuff themselfs. Actually have to plan instead of mindlessly storming in, gun blazing. Or you can just plan to storm in mindlessly, gun blazing, BUT in a fashionable order. You have to take hostages to trade in your friends from custody (if they die or are cuffed) Good enemy A.I.Con's You need human players to interact with objectives, take hostages, grab money ect. Bad ally A.I. I'll understand if the drill jammes one or two times but jamming almost 5 times per heist is rediculous. Heroic civileans get in the crossfire between you and the feds. I don't know if this is a glitch but you can revive and use explosive/medical/ammo bags through walls. Cloakers are one hit kills, bieng able to incapitate/cuff you with a simple kick. Stealthing is nearly impossible without a legitemate team that communicate. Paintings fall on top of trip mines and render them useless. Those same painting's have somekind of superpower of not moving once shot again. Feds are on steriods, they never get tired when scaling buildings or parkouring from roof to roof. No awesome music while stealthing. Hackers, hackers everywhere.... Bugs that cause people to become Hoodini or something, bieng able to shoot a law enforcer, than they take a one-way ticket to space, Shooting a law enforcer and then they swan dive through objects, or getting downed and glitch under the map.Conclusion.I highly recommend this game if you have friends to play it with, and if you really want to, then you can add me to join you. The excitement of getting away with 25,000,000 $ feels amazing, but the suspense builds up to that last moment where you just need to get to the escape vehicle.... Now two things can happen at this point: A. You make it and then you're, well, as Bain puts it ""We're set for life guys"" and B. You can get horifically murderd by swarming cloakers, bulldozers, or the Tazer-brigade. This is a must have for anyone that likes to plan, play, execute and succeed if you play with a team of friends. The last time I checked this game isn't getting updated anymore, but it's good as it is. ""Speed is key"" a wise irishman once said, but that only applies to Heat street. The best way to go is ""Sneaky-beaky like"". If you have $15 dollars to spare, then be sure to pick this up and join me in my quest to steal cash/gold/blood/diamonds/cash molds. ~~Ashe~~ "

												Pretty much a cool game. I've played it before on my cousin's computer, and decided to get one myself. Definitely hits the point of being a robber, but sadly no grenades available, something that seems to be the problem to every robbery in this universe. :vThe issue, though, is fixed (well not entirely) by adding a GL40 weapon (as DLC) and I'd recommend y'all to get the game + the DLC when on sale.Another thing: GET THE SEQUEL AS WELL. YOU'LL LOVE IT.			"

-Quick Review-PAYDAY: The Heist is a first person shooter developed by OVERKILL Software and released in 2011. The game can be played solo, or as 4-player co-op, you get to Heist 6 zones/areas and depending on events that occur within the game your play experience will change.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  There isn't much to say about the story behind PAYDAY: the Heist, it's basically four robbers (Wolf, Dallas, Hoxton, and Chains) who teamed up to Rob the ""First World Bank"".Game Play: As has already been said, the game plays as a FPS but instead of just mindlessly gunning down civilians and cops, you need to be careful about who you shoot (You are penalized for killing civilians), and the game is objective oriented. In other words, ""You could just kill cops for days, and your game would never end, or you can kill as little as possible and get experience faster.""There is a level system within the game, you gain experience from picking up money/gems/currency, as you level up you unlock new weapons, tools, and armor.Achievements: The achievements on PAYDAY: the Heist are TOUGH, most of these require a solid team to play with, or a lot of determination/practice/luck. I haven't taken the time to start working on these achievements yet, I'm only sitting at 7 out of 56 achievements (05/18/15). I intend to try for more achievements, but most of them require specific conditions to be met, and ""must be there at the start of the heist"".Price: PAYDAY: The Heist is priced at $14.99, I personally picked up my copy on the 24 hour give away October 16, 2014. I recommend waiting for a sale to purchase this game. However if you're really into 4-player FPS's this is your game, and you can easily pump 20+ hours into this game, thereby justifying the purchase at full price.Conclusion: I've always felt that I'm not the best critic of these types of games since I spend most of my time playing by myself, or with one other friend. I enjoyed playing PAYDAY: The Heist, however I only played single player or with one friend.I would recommend this to people who already have friends they play 4 player games with, I could see Left 4 Dead fans easily getting attached to this game - if looking for a different flavor of 4-player-FPS.

												So, Payday 2 feels too casual or you just hate its irrational weapon balance? Welcome to the roots!So, here, like in PD2, we have:- Our favorite specials:-- Dozers: simple Dooo.... Wait, WHAT?! HE'S SPRINTIIIIIIING!!!-- Cloakers: nothing to worry about in the silence of the night... AAAHHH!!! Get away from me! GET AAAWAAAY!!! HELP!!!-- Tazers: just Ta-a-a-a-a-azzzzzzze-e-e-e-erzzzzz!!! ZZZ! ZZZZ!!! *on the ground, no ammo*-- Snipers: yes, those little black dots far away out there! You mean which red lazers? Naah, that couldn't be so easy, could it?- Difficulty levels:-- Easy: or is it?-- Normal: no, you really should start with easy!-- Hard: oh, yes, you, courageous one! Heard of loud Death Wish yet?-- Overkill: would you like your a$$ served you on a plate rare or well-burnt?-- 145+: well, oh well!.. Now you will die! ...and die! ...and die...And, unlike PD2:- The FPS are great, but the network code is soooo sloooow.- There's no wrong ""bound-to-fail"" setup - you can make any one work, even with a ""wrong"" weapon.- Skill-trees, that you gradually unlock - feature by feature, no skipping, but you'll eventually get them all for every tree (don't forget about that <Tab + 1...4> button combination during heists).- You have no ""gray screen"" for the last down before custody, but you can tell it is by the health you get back (with every down on lower difficulty levels it decreases: 75% -> 50% -> 25% -> go get your medbag heal NOW!).- No First Aid Kits, so either you go down and hope your buddies will get you up (no Inspire either!), or screw your team's medical supplies (and get kicked for being selfish!)!- Fast-paced raw hardcore experience, where you can only win with skill and team effort on anything harder than Normal.- Yeah, no weapon skins!Give this one a chance! It might just be your thing!			"

												Awesome co-op game, shame there's only few Heists, but You can play it for many ways thanks to random cops and civilians respawn, also Assault Strong is random. Based on My own experience with this game I can honestly recommend it! You won't regret this purchase :)			"

Got a few mates that wanna play? Got for it! In the Steams sales it is currently £1.09 or 2.99 for 4 copies to share with mates!The second is good too, but this is 1. cheaper and two... pretty much the same.			"

												 ""Players will embark on a spectacular crime spree of six heart stopping heists, including blasting their way through a downtown bank vault robbery, managing hostages in an armored car hijacking and even a midnight infiltration of a top-secret, high-security facility. Additionally, PAYDAY: The Heist challenges players with dynamic environments and adaptive enemy tactics - meaning no scenario will ever play out the same way twice. Teamwork is essential to ensure crew members provide cover under fire, guard key access points, break through various security measures and keep civilians in check. Survive wave after wave of the best that law enforcement can deploy as they shift strategies in response to player actions and gameplay style. Collapse"" 7/10			"

												Through this game I have gained experience in robbing banks, much so that I have attempted to rob a bank myself. I am recently typing this out in a penitentiary because law enforcement does not know what ""Restart Mission"" means. Aside from it leading to my arrest in real life, this game is pretty fun. Just don't rob banks, though. The cops in real life are not nearly as easy to evade as the cops in the game.			"

												This game is definitely worth the price. It's hard to compare the two Payday games because they're so wildly different. The Hiest is definitely the grittier of the two, with less visual information, a darker colour scheme, and more confusing map layout. The hiest focuses on the story of each hiest and the character interaction much more than Payday 2. However Payday 2 is more clean-cut and professional, despite the fact that each hiest was seemly planned in under 5 minutes by the dialogue.If you liked the second game for it's mechanics and gunplay, you may still like this game, but it's definately more angled towards the hardcore gamer. On PD2 I play death wish hiests for fun, and whilst stealth in PD2 can be described as broken, it's alot easier than in PD:TH. There's no choice of armour, no choice of melee weapon or skills. Every weapon and weapon and upgrade in the game is unlocked through an as-you-play leveling system where cash and XP are one and the same. In Payday Two It's completely different, and whilst the different skill point systems make each game unique, this has a lot less options.Get this if you're a hardcore hiestser and enjoy a challenge, overwise you may question why you bought this. It's hard, but rewarding.			"

												I know what others say and think, but I could actually argue that the first PAYDAY is, in many ways, better than the sequel. The sequel giveth and it taketh away, but you're here to know why PAYDAY: The Heist is good. I'll cover the sequel in another review.PAYDAY is what you get when you take Left 4 Dead and turn it into Cops vs. Robbers, and you're the robbers. You rob a big bank blind, steal cash from drug dealers in a spectacular way, loot gold from an intercepted armored transport, and more. You can level up three (four with DLC) skill trees to get different perks and guns, and as far as the guns go, there's something for everyone. Whether you like precision, crowd control, or the best of all worlds, there's a gun for you. There's not as many as there are in 2, but none of them are particularly useless (sans the starting pistol and Locomotive secondary shotgun, arguably, but that's beside the point).This is by no means an easy game, so if you want a challenge, you won't be disappointed. You'll quickly discover that cover is your best friend, and teamwork and coordination are essential. The heists are massive in scale and are loads of fun to play, with the difficulty varying per heist. Fair warning: just because Heat Street is the second heist in the list doesn't mean it's only a small step up from First World Bank. It's actually one of the hardest heists in the game. You can level up to 145 without DLC, 193 with DLC. Not to mention, you can max out all available skill trees!The majority of the player base has migrated to the sequel, but you can still find some servers, or set up your own. Grab some friends and give it a go; it's one of the good ones.Also, just a tip for newcomers: if you join a First World Bank server and the host says something about ""overdrill,"" just leave.			"

												This game has changed my life.Never again will I be able to go out in public and not instinctively scout out every single security camera in the area.Never again will I be able to make a deposit at the bank, without singling out the branch manager.Never again will I be able to sit in the reception of a hospital, without having to constantly fight the burning urge to get up and shout at everyone to ""GET DOWN ON THE GROUND!"".Never again will I be able to peacefully enjoy a barbecue party hosted by the neighbor, without subconsciously wondering whether or not he's printing counterfeit currency in his basement.Easily a 10/10, A+ title.

												My love for the Payday games isn't just big it is vaste, i mean no other game company has thought of being a robber in any game every made, until Overkill Software came, They made a master piece Called ""PayDay : The Heist""!Although it lacks guns and maps, it makes up for game experience, at first when i played this game i wasn't impressed, it was fair to be honest, but then after several hours of gameplay, i understood that this was The Monalisa! So First :+ Good community= Fair graphics+ Smart NPCs+ Challenges+ Achievements+ good XP system - Lack of maps- Lack of guns- Somewhat repetitive when you play enough hours ( in which i haven't )+ Fun with friends!+ NPC reactions!+ Single playerI'd say get it!
