												RAGE seems like a strange lovechild if Fallout made love to Quake in the backseat of a racing car. It is a furiously fast-paced FPS with visceral and brutal combat, while at the same time mixing things up with off-road racing, RPG elements, mini-games and crafting.Sounds an awful lot like Fallout, doesn't it? Well, it's not. Despite many striking similarities, RAGE is entirely its own game. It does all the things Fallout does, but in its own way. If you leave your expectations and comparisons at the door and just play the game for what it is, you will find a competent and diverse FPS that may keep you entertained for a good 10-12 hours.RAGE is a linar post-apocalyptic action game with a twist. It has towns with NPCs, quests, exploration, hidden loot and collectibles, mini-games and even racing tracks.But most of all it is a hectic First Person Shooter, and this is where the game shines. The shooter element is the bread-and-butter of RAGE. It's fast, powerful, intense and it feels good! There are a wide range of weapons to use, each of which has numerous different ammunition types to spice things up even more. Take for example the crossbow; it fires regular steel bolts as one would expect - but swap them out with Dynamite sticks and watch your enemies panic as they realize they have only 3 seconds left to live. Swap in the Mindcontrol bolts and the crossbow turns your enemies into deadly walking bombs under your control!The variety of weapons and ammo has you swapping back and forth between them with glee as you leave wasteland mutants in exploded gibs, charred corpses and decapitated slumps. What is even more striking is how the enemies move. They will pounce at you, climb railings to reach you and leap off of walls. They deftly dodge and weave in zig-zag patterns to make your life as miserable as possible. Their movement is fast, sporadic and unpredictable - and it just looks awesome.When you're not dropping mutants by the dozen, the town offers a nice breather away from the gunfights and gives you the opportunity to pick up side-quests for extra challenges. Race for glory at the local racing track or shop and listening to NPC banter. The mini-games range from strumming banjos, throwing dice or even pitting your deck of special playing cards against NPCs. You can also craft your own specialized ammo, grenades and other useful gadgets with ingredients scavenged on missions or bought from merchants.RAGE also has a few downsides, the most glaring perhaps being the poor and sudden ending. The plot is likewise lack-luster, uninteresting and just overall trivial. More often than not I found myself skipping story conversation because it was so bland I just wanted to go back to shooting stuff.The graphics are a mixed blessing. Generally the sky and landscapes are mindlbowingly beautiful, but many of the up-close scenery looks washed out and blurry, sometimes to the point where you can't even make out what you are even looking at.The sound effects and music is very good. The guns sound punchy and futuristic, and the voice acting is excellent from start to finish. The vehicle sounds are, however, quite bland.Overall I feel that RAGE is a worthwhile game that offers a very solid shooter experience and a fairly mediocre ""everything else."" Definitely worthwhile if you enjoy FPS games and/or wasteland style games.+ Excellent FPS-style gameplay, shooting mutants is a treat+ Great wasteland atmosphere and setting+ Tons of fun guns and ammo to play around with+ Lots of variation; racing, minigames, crafting, collectibles, exploring+ Gorgeous graphics in the landscape/environment/character department+ Excellent voice acting and music, overall good sound design- Muddy and blurry graphics in many interior areas and on up-close objects- The story is uninteresting and lacks engagement- Horrible ending- The game is too easy even on the hardest difficulty- Poor mouse controls when navigating menus and inventory- Engine sounds while driving is pretty weak			"

												People can compare Rage to many other games, however it reminds me most of Borderlands with a touch of Fallout and a pinch of Mad Max. However Rage has something new to offer. Yes, it is similar to other games, however what game is not? Rage has a style all its own and really pulls off what they were going for. This is a very grungy game, yet it has times of bright sunny skies and colorful scenes.The story is not heavily detailed but that's alright for the type of game Rage is. It's a FPS that gets to the point and you never feel bored while playing. I thought the story was enough for me to have an idea of what's going on and get me into the action very smoothly. The first few missions give you a better idea of what's going on and flow of the story feels balanced.The gameplay mechanics are very easy to use and to adapt to. Driving is fluid as is walking. The pace of walking is a bit quick, but I like it that way. Be that as it may, I often slowed down my pace to really take note to the detailed environments of the caves, tunnels and dilapidated buildings I scrounged through. The enemies are a joy to fight and have a mind of their own. From scaling the walls to jumping at the last second to dodge your attack, it quickly reminded me of the splicers who walked the ceilings of rapture in Bioshock. This makes it all the more challenging and enjoyable. Lastly, RAGE incorporates some RPG elements to help sooth that part of my gaming palate in the forms of customization, upgrades and side missions. All of that and a vehicle only multi-player tacked on? I believe that's a pretty good package.All in all, I am happy with this purchase and would recommend this to anyone who enjoys shooters with creative atmospheres. I have read mixed reviews about it's length not being what people had hoped (about 10-12 hours) but then again, many of the shooters I have completed were only about 8 hours. With the existence of towns throughout, this will allow me to pace my gameplay and savor the experience without blowing through it a la any other mindless shooter.			"

												A real gem in the rough, While this game has a lot of rough edges and if you do buy it you might want to look up some config or visual modification tools in order to make it work for you the game is well done for the most part. While it may not be as open as some other FPS/RPG games out there it does bring a few good things to the table that others do not have. The enemy models, animations and reaction are very well done, fluid and depending on which faction you're fighting against it might play out differently. NPC interactions are good, and facial animations are very well done making them feel organic at times. The story is a bit rough in places and if you've read anything about this game you will already know that the ending is well not great to say the least. While I do wish there was more to the game then what is offered it was mostly fun while it lasted. The tech in the game world is very nice and refreshing; the in game crafting is rather well done and very quick allowing you to use different items against different enemy types. the ""big picture"" of each scene is mind-blowingly beautiful. This game's canyon vistas are the most intensely gorgeous I've ever seen, and I include Skyrim in that list. Even the interior scenes, with their gross 1990s textures are are composed and lit with an obvious hand-crafted touch. Graphically, it's a ""don't miss the forest for the trees"" kind of situation. Make no mistake though, the art direction and craftsmanship in-game is absolutely phenomenal and despite the blurry textures,If you can buy/find it on sale like I did when I got it, it’s well worth the money, especially once you tinker with the game engine to make it look/run a little better. It’s far better then anything Gearbox has done to date I can honestly say that, it’s not a boring motionless world with singular friendly/peaceful NPCs, however it is no Fallout 3.			"

												Rage, a post apocalyptic game developed by Id software (the makers of the Doom series) and running on there tech 5 game engine.I played this game for both Xbox 360 and PC on Steam. I pre-ordered this game when it was available on Steam so I paid $59.99 for it, its now (as of this re-review) $19.99 and the one DLC is $4.99.The game is your traditional FPS shooter game. Its heavily action packed and has lots some cool weapons. I personally found that the shotgun was the best one to use and favored that over all other weapons. There is crafting in the game as well but I find it very simplistic and only of use when you need to make items to break open locked doors, med packs or throwing blades.I did play both the solo campaign the coop and the multiplayer side of the game. I am amazed at how well this game looks and plays and the voice actors used for voicing the game characters. The graphics are also superb and very detailed and amazing to look at both scenery and attacking enemies.The game includes an addon that wasn't originally available unless it was pre-ordered and that's the sewers to explore. When it was released the game wasn't what gamers were hoping it would be, an open world post apocalyptic game as the media coverage lead you to believe. Once you started playing you quickly found it to be a closed world and once you go through a mission area you can't go back and do it over to get any secrets you left behind or want to find. I didn't find this game to offer any replay value in the solo campaign at all. Don't get me wrong the first play through it increasingly good and very enjoyable.The multiplayer side of the game is just a dune buggy race doing lap after lap and shooting at one another with mini guns and rockets. Its like deathmatch but with cars. Nothing new provided here by Id Software in this regard.The says there is Coop play however this can be misleading because you would expect that you can play the campaign with a friend but this isn't the kind of Coop play that Rage offers. Its basically playing objective based missions with a friend.Rage play's very good with the Xbox 360 controller and that is what I use for all my game play and its what I prefer over the traditional keyboard and mouse.Overall the game is totally amazing for my first impression and first play through but severely lacks for replay value. However the multiplayer and Coop play looks as if it was an after thought.In my opinion Id Software dropped the ball on this game or turned a tech demo into a game. Not sure which. This game made Id Software look dated and relying on its old game play style hopping for success. Had the game been an open world type game with the ability to play it cooperatively then it would have been ground breaking.Pro'sAmazing GraphicsVoiced CharactersBladed throwing weaponCon'sClosed worldNo replay valueCoop play is not campaign basedMultiplay is just deathmatch playCVGAnton's Ratingːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː

												I love RAGE up until the point where it suddenly railroads you into a final mission and then ends abruptly. The first half is great - made even better by the Scorchers DLC. The shooting and AI are first class, the environments and character models look incredible even in 2014 and until you get near the end of it you'll be wondering why everyone gets so down on it. But up until then, RAGE ♥♥♥♥in' rules. Also the racing and co-op are surprisingly well made and fun. Find someone to play them with. Also, wingsticks.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: RAGE Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: FPS; Action; RPG; Post-Apocalyptic My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 20-45 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Auxiliary Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseurs REVIEWRAGE is an extremely underrated game, and is definitely worth your consideration. It's another game where you find yourself exploring a post-apocalyptic wasteland performing missions for money and trying to survive— then wind up saving the world. In that sense, it feels a bit like a Borderlands game, but with a serious undertone and with realistic-style graphics. When you start to play it, though, you will find it definitely has the FPS experience of an ID game.It isn't an open-world game really in the true sense of the meaning. But it isn't exactly forcing you from one level to the next, either. I personally found the world immersive and the story engaging. The narrative is well written, even if it relies heavily on established clichés. And I thought the graphics were quite nice; very, very nice actually— there was several times I found myself taking a moment to look around at the scenery and grab screenshots. The gorgeous visuals and interesting narrative establish an undeniably captivating presentation.As far as gameplay is concerned: the mechanics and controls were solid, and the combat is exciting.  There is a decent amount of gun and enemy variety, but there definitely could be more. It’s enough to keep you interested, but it is certainly somewhat limited. The desire to explore more beautiful landscapes and to finish the interesting story will keep you intrigued, though, if you find yourself growing bored with the combat in the later stages of the campaign. It is certainly a decently sized game. And there are sidequests and minigames that are pretty fun if you are into achievements and extras.Besides the campaign, there is a coop multiplayer mode where you can clear dungeons with a friend. There are a good number of missions to beat and they tie into the main campaign as little background stories of NPCs and locations. It is quite fun, actually, and adds a very welcome bonus layer of content.Also, there is a racing multiplayer mode (for which I had trouble finding games, to be honest). I was able to find a few games with a low amount of people— but it wasn't living up to its full potential. It matters little in the long run, as the rest of the game is well worth it.And so: if you are looking for a story-driven, atmospheric, and action-packed FPS game with a high standard of quality, you would be wise to give RAGE some consideration.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												I've read so many things about RAGE, how it was a huge disappointment, what kind of a lacklustre game it was. I needed to give it a try and all I can say is that while the game is a lot better than its counterparts in many areas, it lacks some vital things to make the world more vivid.Pros:- Enemy AI is great, they are responding to how you play. If you're going head on with a shotgun in your hands, they try to stay far and shoot you down with AR's or surround you with their greater numbers. If you're playing one shot one kill, they act swiftly and try to mow you down with their athletic skills.- Enemy variety is good. You never find yourself killing the same type of enemy all the time. Even in missions and bandit clans, variety is good.- Town designs are good and based on real world architecture. For example Subway Town is based on Chinese style, Jackal Territory resembles Brazilian Favelas, Dead City is the classic metropolis.- Different accent and characteristics for every bandit clan feels great, a lot better than any other generic bandits in games.- If you play stealthy, there are a lot of times where you can see how bandit clans work, how they are small military dictatorships, ruled by benevolent and paternal figures. Great insight.- Missions are great, especially Dead City is one of the most memorable FPS missions for me.- Caricature NPCs, like J.K Stiles and Dietrich are great. - References in the story, things that are hidden shows that this game was made with passion and the goal was to lead the player to experience the game fully.- Boss fights.- Ammo and weapon variety can make any FPS player wet, but an oldschool LMG could add a lot to the gameplay.Cons:- Sİlent protagonist is a huge no for this kind of game. I've been asleep for years, I should speak, eat, drink, love, hate etc. I need to do things that makes me feel what it's like to be a human again. For example, one of the first missions could be getting in shape something like (Run 20 miles, do some push ups (like in GTA:SA)). The protagonist feels like a mindless robot.- Alienation of the protagonist continues with no personal story. Finding devices that contained data about him should have told who he was, all you get for motivation to play is ""this is this, that is that, now go kill them.""- Secondary missions could use some variety. Assassinate this guy, destroy that thing, drive for this person, try to convince someone, organize resistance, build up defences etc. would be great and very fitting for the personality as he was one of the ""chosen ones"" before the apocalypse. - NPC dialogues are weird. One step and he starts talking, one step to back, he ends talking abruptly.- Towns and settlements should have been more lively, developed according to your actions. For example you do one work for future expansions when you go back you should see that the town has expanded.- More enterable buildings could be better.- Subtitles inside the towns are ♥♥♥♥ed, your dialogues are interrupted with megaphone announcements.- Needed more quests.- Economy is ♥♥♥♥. You do some quest, you earn money and you give it all back to get some ammo and upgrades for the next mission.- Eastern Wasteland is the definition of dull. All gray with nothing interesting to see around.- Last mission, ending of the story was terrible, no decent closure to the story and there was no boss fight. In general it was easier than most of the other missions.- If more sandbox elements were added it could enhance the game incredibly (actually I suspect that they were going for this at one point, but when they were acquired by Bethesda, the plans went to ♥♥♥♥).Seems like RAGE has great potential to build upon and all of the Pros I listed are examples of great mechanics and level design. Only thing that they needed to improve upon is story and open world elements. I, personally, would be more excited about a RAGE 2 than the new DOOM.P.S: People said that they got lots of texture pop-ins that are of course pretty annoying. But for me, with my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop with Intel HD 3000 and 4 GB RAM, it ran like a charm. Even explosions did not cause FPS drops. "

												RAGE is a great game at first. Everything feels unique . The graphics are incredible and the atmosphere stunning. The weapons feel satisfying and the enemy AI responsive. The enemies are not too tough , but not too easy either. The story seems interesting in the beginning too. The driving can be fun and there are options to modify your weapons and vehicles. The world seems big enough for you to explore , which is also pretty nice. The crafting system is simple and useful. Additionally , the mechanics in total feel useful .There are also plenty of mini-games you can play in order to earn some extra cash which are pretty fun. The combat system is similar to most of the shooters today, nothing special , but was made better and more engaging by specific mechanics , like the wingsticks . Overall, the first few hours spent in the game were enjoyable and the game just felt great. After the first few hours of gameplay,however,  the game starts going downhill. The weapons  stop feeling that great and the game starts to repeat itself just to make you feel that it's longer. The missions feel incredibly repetitive and I just felt that the only thing I was doing was to drive from point A to point B and then kill endless waves of enemies.  I also started getting really mad about my character , since I never got to even hear his voice. Even the driving started becoming extremely boring and the challenge had all been lost , since I was never pressed for ammo. There were infinite supplies of everything : grenades , bandages , ammo. The enemies stopped being interesting and handling them was just too easy. I didn't even get to finish the game , since the atmosphere and gameplay became so repetitive that drove me mad! It felt like an endless motive.. Last but not least ,the lack of cutscenes took away the immersion for me as well. It felt like the game lacked something basic , apart from the other. As a conclusion , every aspect of the game was simply ruined by the unneccesary extreme length of the storyline , which caused repetitiveness.To sum up , RAGE is a fun shooter at first , but as you get used to the mechanics and the gameplay  , as well as the story and the mission patterns , it stops being  immersive and throws away the potential.Thanks for reading and I hope that this review has been helpful!

												I kept going hot & cold with Rage to start with, but my perserverence was rewarded when the story line kicked up a gear & suddenly, hours flew by. The whole linear story line holds no issues with me, there's nothing wrong with a single thread-story if it's an immerseive experience.On the one hand, it has the same issue Farcry 2 has; it's side jobs that extend the game time are little repetative at times, popping you out of the experience & it has a typical id trait that means the character feels slightly ponderous in his movement. Not a major thing, but something I need a little game time to adapt to.However, that said, the combat is excellent, the AI engages in tactics that vary from one group or tribe to the next; some use melee weapons, others keep their distance, the Authority uses armour & sheilds. They use grenades, they retreat when you over power a squad, they use cover... It really holds onto you as a player. The mutants, meanwhile, are aggressive, really fast moving & resistant to injury, so you have to be accurate & prepared to retreat yourself. They crawl on any surface so appear out of no where, giving some genuine tension when an NPC tells you to go into mutant-infested locations.Secondly, the little mini-games; trump cards, gambling machines, holographic games to bet on, racing... all make it feel like there are actual communities looking for entertainment & diversions. You're not forced to engage with these, but they do add detail to the 'world'.While the car segments aren't the worst in an FPS, OK at best, it's the FPS part that makes the game. All the weapons have different flaws & strengths, all have various ammo types to play with that give advantages but also have drawbacks. This means you have to use your loadout rather than just use one gun as everything is useful & necessary. Remote control cars with bombs, sentry bots/turrets. emp grenades... all of these can be built using parts found laying around, plus to get a dead characters ammo, you have to 'use' them, all making the player get involved in the game, rather than just shooting anything that moves. As different groups & tribes favour different weapons, you're forced to consider what guns to use depending on who you're fighting.The problem for Rage is that Doom 3 & id's reputation hangs around it's neck a bit, colouring what is a good story driven FPS. Give it a fair chance, put enough time in for the plot to shift up a gear, 5 hours plus at least, & it will reward you. For me, a fully filled-out world is more than just being a sandbox shooter & Rage is an example of that. It's not a top game, but it's pretty good & certainly worth spending time with.			"

												This is a hell of a game. I remember it getting heavily critizied when it first came out for technical issues, but these have been fixed now, you will need a decent rig to be able to play RAGE on full graphics, understandably though, since it looks absolutely stunning. The game play reminded me very much like Borderlands, lots of different types of weapons, and your vehicle that you can upgrade with different weapons and armour. The there so much content here, just the right amount of side missions to go along with the main story, that makes the flow of the game feel good. There is a few dull moment where you find yourself running from point to point in the cities, but they come part in parcle with this sort of game. Another interesting feature would be the racing, this is done very well, the controls are perfectly carried out, not difficult at all, and it is actually a really nice addition to the game, it gives a nice break between running and gunning. I would really recommend RAGE, there is about thirty hours of content here and you can always get this really cheaply now days.			"

												It was definitely fun. But there are a few things that really took away from it.Positive:- The graphics and environments are still amazing, even today.- The AI is incredible. Enemies are dificult enough to keep you awake. Their death animations are realistic, and make you feel like you actually just killed a real human being... yay.- The combat is fun and engaging, though you'll never be pressed for ammo. - The racing is pretty good, even if it's almost impossible to lose.Negative:- Your character is boring. He's silent, and has basically no personality beyond people telling him that he's awesome.- The main antagonists aren't even seen until the second half of the game.- The main antagonists are basically just future Nazis.- The textures take a while to pop in.- The final mission is really really short, and there's no huge boss battle. Just a bunch of easy-♥♥♥ enemies that I breezed through with a shotgun.- The ending isn't really explained, and makes no sense at all.I give it a 7/10. Worth at least one playthrough. "

												First off, I think this game is awesome, which is made even better by the fact that I got it for free with my graphics card back when it came out.  However, its a VERY mixed bag in terms of quality in various categories.TEXTURES:  Terrible pretty much across the board.  The game engine also mishandles the loading of the textures so that they ""pop in"" if you rotate your view at even a modest speed.  The pop in problem can be minimized via config tweaks, but there isn't much that can be done for the low quality assets themselves.LIGHTING:  Disappointing to say the least.  The vast majority of shadows are baked in and ugly, and the few objects with dynamically-rendered shadows (enemies, cars, etc.) only cast a single shadow from the strongest light source, leading to shadows suddenly shifting when the strongest light source changes.  The particle and distortion effects created by things like torches look great, however.  The only other lighting effects to speak of are some weak HDR and specular maps.GAMEPLAY:  Once you fix the narrow default FOV (+cvaradd g_fov 15 in the launch options), the game is great.  The weapons feel epic and you can carry ludicrous amounts of ammo for them in up to three different flavors (e.g. buckshot, pulse shot, and exploding shells for the shotgun).  The racing side of the game isn't quite as good as the shooting, mostly due to a uniform lack of variety making it something of a chore later on, but everything handles well.  In addition, this game has some of the best animation I have ever seen, particularly the enemy behavior.  They jump off of walls and combat roll in an effort to avoid your fire, and their death animations are wonderfully unique, combining scripted sequence and ragdoll physics seamlessly.  Also, quicksaves!  Every time a PC game omits a manual saving feature, a puppy dies.  Fact.RANDOM STUFF:  The mouse feels janky in the menus, but feels fine in game.  The cursor becomes almost unusable at lower sensitivities.  Also, some areas of the game get blocked off as you progress through the main story, so you'll want to complete any and all side quests you see first thing upon entering a new location.  In addition, the game could do with being a bit more difficult.  The amount of extra money and upgrades that can be found through exploration is either good or awful, depending on how OCD you are.  Lastly, this game has little in the way of replay value or endgame content, as all you can do is run the Mutant Bash arena figher thing or any of the races over and over again.  Each co-op mission is standalone and the multiplayer is racing only.I'd give this game an 8/10 overall, the absolutely incredible old-school inspired gunplay quickly makes you forget that the game looks older than Half-Life 2.  Oh, and don't even bother buying this game without the Scorcher's DLC.  The extra weapons are a riot (nailgun and railgun, the quake classics), it allows you to keep playing after you complete the final mission, so you can backtrack and do any side quests you may have missed, and it grants you access to the Ultra Nightmare difficulty, which is as close to challenging as this game gets.  Thanks for reading!			"

												First and foremost: RAGE is a strikingly beautiful game. Coming from iD, I would expect no less. Since the dawn of the shooter they've been at the forefront of cutting edge technology with a minimum of requirements. With new engine iD Tech 5, they've done it again - this is one of the most beautiful game worlds ever realised. It's staggering the amount of detail that can be seen in this title, from the cliffs and canyons to the exquisite characters. But for all it’s beauty, RAGE is a shooter very much stuck in the past, and while story and character have been beefed up a great deal from past iD products, they just can’t compare with shooters of today. RAGE is wonderful to play, but caring about the game world or having an emotional attachment to any character is a darn sight harder.You awaken in the beginning from a cryo-chamber after many hundreds of years of slumber. The world has mostly been destroyed by an asteroid, and various mutants, bandits and factions now control various parts of this ‘wasteland’. Upon exiting the safe confines of this vault, noting that the other inhabitants have long since deceased, you’re attacked by a mutant and saved by a local. In short time you’re given a gun and you’re told to start shooting. As is the pedigree of this developer, RAGE is a shooter first and foremost.It’s a very traditional shooter as well, corridors and small warehouses rule the day, and enemies jump out from the shadows and behind inaccessible doors. While the game world is at times large, this is more of a playground for vehicular destruction and transportation, getting from one location to another, and can be considered filler. While it has its moments it certainly feels like a part of the world to give it a greater ‘Mad Max’ vibe – there for the sake of being there, and it begins to lose its sheen the longer you play. However, it plays second fiddle to the shooting, and while no one could accuse RAGE of being revolutionary, it’s not held back by its lack of ambition.In fact, because of this, RAGE’s old-school gameplay feels a little fresh, even if it’s playing to its out-dated strengths. The guns, for instance, genuinely feel powerful, and the ragdoll physics really show their strength. Shoot a guy with an arrow, and he’ll stick to a wall. Blast out their legs and they’ll flip over as they’re in full pelt. Shields crack and splatter from impacts, skulls crack open, and generally, the various guns, each with multiple ammo types, feel creative and meaty.In addition, there are many single use items that can be crafted, found or purchased throughout the game world, such as bladed boomerang ‘wingsticks’, gun turrets, spider droids and RC bomb cars, to name a few. Occasionally you may need to be creative, with the enemy A.I being considerably good. They tend to work together, hide behind shield carrying allies, flush you out with bombs, call orders to each other, flank and generally do their best to kill you. Even suicidal mutants will jump back and forth, hop around corridor walls and ceilings, only to backstab you. The various enemies each have their own powers and weapons they favour as well, zig-zagging while they throw screen-darkening clutter at you, ducking and dodging as you’re blasting away. Thankfully, the pacing is spot on, you never feel over-whelmed, and there is always enough challenge.Apart from the shooting, there are odd jobs around towns, such as blowing up bandits cars in certain areas, various race types, delivering timed mail, and even a circus like murder simulation television show where you are literally put into arenas of death. None of it is as compelling as the main quest, but it does help break up the monotony, and helps create the illusion of a living, breathing world. The detail to RAGE is exhaustive, in only the best and most obsessive point possible.This obsession has been carried to some of the most detailed and amazing character models yet seen in any game. Sadly, they’re not all too interesting. Especially when the game attempts to shift gears and provide a sense of tension – I just wasn’t feeling it. The good guy archetype character is boring as hell, the corrupt characters as cliché’d and obvious from the start. Everyone plays their character, but there is no real personality, and there never feels like a compelling villain or even a compelling reason to your character. The world feels like it’s had far too much lavished upon it’s visuals that it’s characters have become secondary.The faceless bandits and “Authority” you fight throughout the game might as well be very detailed stick figures with some great artificial intelligence. Fun to shoot at but why should I care? For all the amazing detail, and terrific character animations, especially by the town folk, they might as well all be playing parts in a stage play. Yet even as I played away, hoping to find a payoff, I was quite disappointed. There is no real satisfying conclusion or encounter, and it felt like I was really only fighting for my own personal entertainment rather than any emotional connection.As of this writing, RAGE has been available for just over two years and it’s more interesting modes have been all but abandoned by gamers. The online multiplayer, once iD’s main claim to fame, is not supported, and the co-op mode, while fun, with a friend I was able to rope in, never felt like a compelling addition, just a very good one. And that really sums up how I feel about RAGE. It’s a game that feels rooted in the developer’s past while having the vision, the visuals, and the environment, to look towards the future. RAGE proves that iD knows how to craft a fun shooter, yet struggles to create compelling characters or even a memorable narrative. Why should I care about the town of Wellspring when I only just entered it? Despite the context, RAGE is still a blast to play. It may not be revolutionary, but its still a finely crafted shooter that is a whole heaping of fun and comes recommended as something a little old-school.8.0/10.			"

												Imagine a mixture of Red Faction: Guerilla, Fallout and Metro 2033.Now slightly lower your expectations.And there you go, that's RAGE.It falls a bit short story-wise, but is a solid game and a lot of fun to play.A must for fans of the post-apocalyptic setting and at least worth a look for everyone else.

												I wish Steam had a ""Meh"" rating, because that's how I felt about Rage.  Not a solid ""No"" but definitely not a ""Yes.""  RAGE is, let's be clear, an old-school shooter.  In spite of slightly open visuals, most of your FPS action occurs in the same general tunnels and limited pathways that Id Software has been doing since Wolfenstein 3D.  Oh, and there's a driving/racing component which is decidedly ""meh.""  The IdTech 5 engine is visually reasonably pretty, but the game is, I gather, pretty poorly optimized to take full advantage of the highest resolution textures.  But to be honest, I don't find the graphics all that amazing, and graphics alone don't sway me without otherwise solid gameplay.The story itself is pretty humdrum stuff, and ends rather abruptly.  I gather we won't be seeing a sequel, at least not any time soon, since Id is busy with Doom 4.  Honestly, it's nothing special.  Post-apocalyptic wasteland controlled by authoritarian regime (very cleverly known as ""The Authority.""  Yeah.).  Plucky rebel faction fights against them and sees you as their possible savior because...aw hell, I forget why.  But whatever.  You're the chosen one.You fight alone through Id corridors using mostly typical weapons (pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle, etc.).  There's some variation there, but it's all the usual suspects.  The gunplay itself is kind of meh, really.  I found the sound design for the weapons to generally be kind of underwhelming.  They seem to ""clatter"" rather than ""boom,"" if that makes sense.  The wingstick is kinda neat, but limited in ammo.The minigames are generally pretty forgettable.  Gambling stuff, racing, and rhythm games, really.  Nothing special.Honestly, the game plays like an ""also ran"" to Borderlands, but it takes itself much more seriously and lacks any co-op component.  I'd say it's worth not more than $5.  At that rate, it's decently fun to run around and shoot stuff.  But it's a fairly disposable game and even at a $5 price tag, you won't be missing much if you skip it.			"

												For all the artistic and technical talent that Id has at its disposal, you'd think that after all these years they'd pick up someone who could write an interesting story. But Rage, like every property Id had created, has a shallow and generic setting, a mere framework for the gameplay it supports. And sadly, the gameplay equally lacks in innovation.That's not to say I didn't have fun; for an action-shooter FPS, the combat could be remarkably tense, thanks to some good AI and an impressive moveset for all the enemies. The NPCs advance, take cover, throw grenades, retreat, and even try to drag their wounded carcasses out of the firefight. The fights were probably the best part of the game, which is all the more odd since the weapons you fight with are so dismayingly underpowered (in fact, the bulk of my kills were with the pistol with which you start the game). I have equally little to say in favor of the mission-based gameplay and even less about the abysmal driving segments, both of which seemed tacked on to show off the open world technology rather than for interesting gameplay.And what about that technology? The graphics engine -IdTech5 - excels in creating large detailed levels with sharp textures; there's no low-res skybox in this game! But it rarely takes advantage of this technology; the outdoor levels are broken apart by narrow canyons so you rarely get a feel for the expansiveness of the world. Worse, this impressive long-range detail comes at a cost to the short; close up, the models are distinctly low-polygon in comparison to those used in other modern games. In many areas, Rage looks decidedly second-class.Throw in a variety of other gaffes - serious technical issues (albeit none that effected me), uninteresting ""mini-games"", unskippable cinematics and a noticeable lack of content - and its not hard to understand why some are calling Rage just another Id tech-demo. It has its moments, but as a complete product it is significantly lacking.			"

												Very fun game. There is indeed a lack of variation in the gameplay but it is still strangely enjoyable, probably because they make up for it with the nicely made levels and pretty graphics. Cars are rather boring and not incredibly worth the time, could've been a lot better if they spent more time building on the cars. Overall; good game, pretty graphics, fun gameplay, boring story, boring cars, still fun and maybe wait for a sale to get this game.			"

												+ Beautifully realised game world. When the textures are at their peak they're gorgeous, and this game is a prime example of Post-Processing done right. There is an unbelievable amount of visual fidelity & attention to detail in the game that makes the environments feel seamless, believable and immersive.+ Fantastic animations and voice acting make for lively, genuine characters.+ Great enemy AI - though their banter gets repetitive, they'll duck & weave and take cover to make combat more difficult for you.+ Satisfying gunplay, with weapons that feel like they have some kick on account of good audio mixed with realistic enemy reactions.+ Linear, but with PLENTY of exploration. Don't go in expecting Fallout's expanse or Call of Duty's hand-holding; RAGE sits fairly solidly as a mid-ground between these two ends of the spectrum.+ The driving is actually FUN. Vehicles handle nicely, and I found myself playing all the races out of enjoyment rather than necessity.- Horrible texture pop-in, which detracts greatly from the experience in some areas where flat, mushy Play-Doh surfaces are rampant. No, your eyes aren't blurry... that's just the game's major gaping technical flaw.- Easier difficulty than you'd expect from some of the godfathers of First Person Shooters. I'm usually a normal difficulty kinda guy, but if you have ANY experience with FPS games then ""Normal"" is a vacation and ""Easy"" is just insulting. ""Hard"" feels like the definitive experience, where it's difficult enough that you'll want to experiment with everything in your arsenal, but not SO difficult that you can't rely on the basic pistol to carry you through most situations. Seasoned shooter fans will want to skip right to ""Nightmare"" or ""Ultra-Nightmare"", but even then the veterans and masochists will probably leave unsatisfied.- Boring soundtrack that really doesn't live up to the standard of the sound effects & ambience. It's uninspired, and frankly too loud - I turned it down, but you wouldn't be missing out on much to just turn it off altogether.- Pre-order DLC shenanigans. Generally this isn't an issue because the content isn't worthwhile or players can buy it afterwards, but the Anarchy Edition content is valuable and can only be obtained by hunting down a DLC code for sale or cheating. Throw Pop Rocket ammo in the Double Barrel Shotgun and you have a dual grenade launcher that makes quick work of difficult bosses, and the Fists of Rage & Rat Rod buggy are straight-up statistical improvements over the vanilla versions. The armor essentially combines the game's 3 ""classes"" into one, making your life in the game much easier.On top of my playtime here, I also played on PS3 at release and achieved 100% - I bought it again to experience PC graphics and play The Scorchers.

""Immersive FPS & Road Rampage from ID""Rage was the long anticipated project of ID Software. Some mixture of a decent FPS and a wasteland stockcar racing like in Borderlands. Ofc the racing controls are not the most amazing but it makes quite fun to do some boost jumps and armed car fights. There's also a MP. But it's just concentrated on MonsterBashTV and some car arenas. Unfortunately it's quite laggy.However the end product has breathtaking good graphics, especially the 64bit version if you buy the DLC. Rumors tell the DLC ""The Scorcherer's Job Path"" was once included in the main game and just bought separately to make more money. Bad tongues consider the games as one unique 40GB texture because no stone seems like the other. The skybox looks just amazing. All human characters including the enemies feel pretty vivent and natural in their animations. Otherwise some plants are rendered as awful 2D sprites into the 3D world.  The enemy AI is also brilliant. They act smart and take cover, flee on losses or try to jump on you. The campaign is pretty linear. You will meet several families and communities that you can join after you finished some missions for them. Some new interesting features are a quick weapon menu for 4 weapons, different bullet types, several craftable items like spider turrets and lock grinder, melee weapon wingsticks, defib unit for after death revive (max 3 times). Rage is just an impressive graphics adventure.			"

												A semi-open world semi-linear FPS game. You are a survivor of a post-apocalyptic world, battling bandits and mutants at first until you are dragged into a resistance in war with a corrupted army of battle armor soldiers.This game have one linear main quest, and a number of side quests per main event. Each main quest involve you traversing an area like a city, a dungeon, or a tunnel to find something or kill everyone. Backtracking/sidetracking options are very limited, so there is no feeling of repetition at all.Weapon options are padded very nicely. The variety are there and not too overwhelming. Your guns are upgraded progressively, and each have their own pro and cons. Your most basic guns are still very useful near the end of the game when you have access to upgraded ammos. The crafting system is there, but I find myself only crafting a few items and ignore all the rest. The sentry bots are kinda OP though, they are very useful in a fight and their ingredients are cheap and common.There are plenty of mini-games to explore during your main-quest downtime. There's a racing game that is actually pretty good! And there's a collectible card game where the cards are part of the game's collectible items scattered throughout the world. There's an arena for you to kill mutants for money when you just want to kill stuff.Although it is considered an old release now, you will still need a powerful rig to run this game. The graphics are very good even when compared to today's standard. The gameplay itself is good, but the menu controls feels like a bad console port, mouse sensitivity is very inconsistent.For achievement huntersThe Scorchers DLC is needed for 100% completion. Minimum 2 playthroughs are recommended if you want to collect all the achievements. Single player achievements are all quite doable, and all of the missable achievements are no longer missable after years of patches. Except a few will require some luck and patience if you aren't very good in that mini-game. Multiplayer is dead, 3-player boosting is needed for 100% completion. Also, 2-player coop buddy will be needed for the coop campaign.The ending is kinda disappointing.Other than that, this is a very good game.My score: 9/10			"

												Pay no mind to the bethesda badge on the box, this is actually an id software game (and it IS in face developed by them). So straight out the door you should immediately remove fallout from your mind, and while you're at it borderlands (although the world is similar). Look at the games id made: Doom, Wolfenstein, and Quake are the ones that come to most minds and should be a great example of what kind of game this isNo, there is no real RPG element to this game. No there is no crazy loot system. No it is not a huge open world (although it is probably the most open world-ish of any id game). No it is not a multithreaded complex story. But then again, did any of id's games have any of that? So please stop thinking it's a bethesda game before you buy it, you'll thank me.So what IS this game then? It's an id game. For its time it had amazing ground breaking graphics (and still looks great to this day). It has very tight and crisp combat with very well done controls, perfect level design, and amazing ai. And when I say amazing ai i mean I put it in my list of games with best ai. It's not mind blowing because of it's complexity and intuition, but because of the variety and character it gives all the enemies.So what's the downside? This game is one of those games where a developer obviously is trying something new to the point where you feel it isn't in their typical style. As a result a lot of the ""fluff"" content and features feel not only mediocre, but also unnecessary. Also because this game does not focus primarily on level design it's not something I see myself going back and playing again and again like I would with the old doom and quake titles.In short I do consider this a great game, but certainly not id's best form. The combat and level design are really at the quality only id was capable of (I say was because id is no longer id), and the new tech that Carmake put in this is pretty awesome. It's a blast and, while short lived overall, it is well worth every penny of the $10 price. It might even make you feel hopeful about the game industry again, you jaded ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												This game is actually really good.The weapons are varied and interesting.  It's primarily a FPS with car racing/destruction in a Mad Max style future.  You progress the story by doing fetch quests.Graphics are still pretty good and the shooting mechanics are satisfying.

												If you don't expect what it can't deliver, it's an amazing game.  Stunningly beautiful environment art and great guns with good variety (and I find myself switching all the time).  Good level design.  It's quite a rigid and pretty heavily scripted world but it's beauty never ceases to amaze and the gameplay keeps being fun for a long while.  The driving/racing component is a bit harder to like, I find, but it's still enjoyable.  Story is nothing to rave about and the characters are forgettable, but the setting of the game is so well presented, it never really becomes too much of an issue.  Overall, if you like good old FPS action delivered with a level of fidelity raised by a good margin, Rage is a really solid pick.			"

												     if you think that this game is just another typical post-apocalyptic game genre, well you are wrong. RAGE is like Fallout meets Borderlands, it brings the players a good 20 hours of gameplay a world that you could free roam with assortment of vehicles found in the game, and shoot some enemies with your large arsenal of weapons.Overall the game has good graphics, pleasing environment sounds and in-game soundtrack even better, but what the game lacks is a good storyline, a bit of game lore, more challenging boss fights,and a better multiplayer system. I give this game a 8/10 "

												Having finished the game I'm conflicted to 100% recommend the game.If we consider a game having a beginning, a middle and an end, then this game has a strong beginning, a heavily declining middle and a completely missing ending.Without spoiling anything of the story:You expect the final to be your last stand, having your strongest weapons at the ready only to find yourself finishing the game via cutscene.Personally, the ending was a letdown and I would consider it a key event which should trigger the finalphase, but it was the end of the game and I doubt we will ever see a fullfilling ending.All in all this game is a ""somewhat"" in every category it represents.An O.K. shooter with utility ammunition or gadgets which you will only ever use once to progress the story.Acceptable graphics once you follow the guide posted on steam to improve the visuals of the game.Weapon upgrading is shallow and only for the base weapons every other weapon stays unmodified and yet more effective than any of the upgraded weapons. (Excpect for the shotgun. Shotgun is god, especially with the alternative ammo.Story starts off somewhat strong but in the end you are the maid for everything; a simple goon that does what he's told.Enemy variety is scarce. They may look different but behave the same. They either charge at you fast with a melee weapon, slow while shooting with heavy ordnance and armor or hiding behind cover and shooting with their forehead exposed for a clean shot.The minigames are there but are neither lucrative nor rewarding.The DLC is available early and awards you with a ""one shot, one kill""-weapon. Noice.In conclusion:It's a borderline OK game, because graphics have to be improved from your side otherwise your experience is kinda ""blurry"".Worth the buy on sale but with an unsatisfying / abrupt ""ending"". You have been warned.PS: The video showing the devs of the game boasting about the features of the game is highly exagerated. Having experienced all listed features it's a meh : an attempt has been made out of 10.			"

												I just finished my third play through of Rage not because it’s such an awesome game but because it’s a 20 gb installation and I’m going to get my headache’s worth before I finally uninstall it. I actually bought the physical DVD version (free after rebate!) and it was a pain getting it installed and registered with Steam. Those of you who buy the game through Steam shouldn’t have any problems though.I heard that Rage got a lot of flak when it came out because it’s from Bethesda and people thought it would be an HD Fallout game with drivable cars. Instead it’s a mostly linear shooter with some crafting elements and side quests. The graphics really reminded me of Doom 3 (ID Software developed the game) right from the start except with the game taking place mostly in the sunny outdoors.  I suppose it’s technically “open world” but there’s no built in game map, so when you’re cruising in your car you really just follow waypoints. The world’s not that big anyways though. Rage is NOT an RPG, so there is no level up system or skill point system. Instead you rely on your array of weapons and different ammo types to blast your way through. Non-spoiler story synopsis: An asteroid hits the Earth and a bunch of “arks” are seeded around the world to wake up after the catastrophe. You play one of the ark survivors waking up and exploring the post-apocalyptic world. This means mutants, bandits, and high tech “new world order” enemies. Really, the story isn’t very well explained through gameplay. Kind of spoiler: There’s no final boss! You’re just playing along in the last area and after holding off a swarm of enemies the game’s over. I was surprised since I had been hording up ammo and didn’t get to use some of the special ammo I was saving up. In all I think the game took about 12 hours to finish but on this my third run I’m skipping some of the side missions. Like I mentioned earlier, there’s no level ups anyway so I won’t really be missing out on anything but story. Overall I’d give the game a thumbs up. Good graphics, a decent challenge, and pretty cheap nowadays (I think it’s about $5 on sale sometimes). Multi-player is dead though, so factor that into your buying decision. "

												Hidden Gem!Wow, after having this game on my list for a while (I don't even remember when I bought it!), I finally decided I should play this before jumping into the latest DOOM. I was contstantly blown away by the graphics quality on a game from Oct 2011! Thats just over 5 years ago!! Runs smooth as silk - especially when forcing V-sync and Triple Buffering. Please be sure to buy the game now at $10, or on the next special, it is WELL worth it!!! And if you already have it, but put it down, pick it up again and finish it!! I can't believe I left this for so long!! 5 Stars for its time! And an easy 4 stars today! (Running on i7 and GTX 960, max settings)P.s. Scorchers DLC is also a great addition - Extra story playable anytime, and once completing the Wellspring Tunnels(?) you score a Nailgun/Rebar-gun (one shotpin enemies on walls) /RAILGUN (shoot enemies through walls with scope!)P.P.s. Just found this on Community Page - nice 4 min preview of the game. Pity its only 720P, as the graphics are so much better in game!

												I tried to like this game. I really tried. I played it ages ago and got up to Kvasir and then just stopped out of lack of desire to continue. Started fresh with the hope of finishing another game in my library and this time I'm knee deep in Subway Town's missions, but I got to a point where I just can't.The biggest crime this game does is being mediocre. It's a competent shooter with bad design choices, poor and convoluted writing, monotonous unskippable dialogues, bland characters, and even worse animation of said characters. But by far the weakest part of the game are the enemies.What broke the camel's back for me was the god damn Muties. I just... It's so frustrating to have to go through quest after quest that just has these shottie fodder running at you over, and over, and over, and over... Just to end it off predictably fighting a kraken mutie, and then run back through the same path you went in, cause yay boring level design. Bandits atleast have you facing off and picking them off from a distance while some either rush you or hop on a turret. FYI, car sections aren't any different. Once you've done the Wellspring races, and got annoyed by the bandits attacking you on your commute between missions, you're not getting anything new.But even then, there is no variety of gameplay styles. They give you crossbow and a section early on in the game where you have the option to do a somewhat stealth run, LITERALLY tells you to go stealthy, and then tears it away before you barely had a chance to pull the trigger when enemies start showing up with head gear and need two shots to drop. First shot hits, enemy shouts out before you get to lock another bolt in their skull, then you might as well get the shotgun out and go rush face.It's just... Dull.			"

												I am slightly conflicted when recommending this game. People may enjoy different things out of a game than I do.As per usual with my reviews, I'll take my time to lay out why I recommend this game.I bares noting that I finished the game on the ultimate hardest difficulty, only available to owners of the Scorchers DLC.Rage has a combat system that I regard as fun. Especially in the beginning, assuming you went the hardest difficulty, the game quickly plays the resource game. I was challenged often to use my ammo sparingly, keeping my real good guns for emergencies.Money is on short supply as well, so it becomes a balancing act of fighting and earning money to cover your costs.The really strong weapons, like the shotgun (which remains a solid option throughout the game) will run out of ammo fast if you only use that. Sadly, this balance can be ruined by an exploit. It's a little convoluted, but workable. I tried it and felt I ruined the experience a little bit for myself, having large stocks of ammo now. There was no way I would waste 500 shotgun shells halfway through the story. If you feel honorable enough, you can avoid doing it.The combat itself is enjoyable. The guns feel like they have weight, and rightfully so. Hitting something with the full blast of a shotgun will annihalate a small enemy, and stun normal ones with a second killing them. Using a grenade to stun the really big enemies is a valid tactic to then unload shotgun ammo into them.But if you play on a hard difficulty, you'll not be running and gunning. In fact, much like the enemies, you'll be looking for cover often and peak out to exploit their unfortunate positioning, if any.And if you get shot? Well, the revive mechanic is there to save you, zapping you back to life if it has a charge.This is a good mechanic to balance the cheap lucky shots the enemies sometimes like to dole out.Storywise, the game is solid. It's not the best, but it tries to be comprehensible and cohesive. It feels like a potential that wasn't fully tapped into. This is noticeable in two things. One is the missions, where they objective is little more than progress through area's through, well, shooting and reaching the end. Then make your way back, often using a shortcut.But the worst part is, however, it's ending.Now, I would not skip on buying this game because of it. It's literally the last mission that is completely ♥♥♥♥. You break in a facility, spend a few hallways killing and pushing buttons and then tough out a minor gauntlet. No final boss, nothing to really write home to.Everything before that mission seems fine and as the same quality as the rest of the game. Which makes it even more mindboggling. I cannot fathom why something like this was ended in such a way.It begs the question if it wasn't rushed or something.The same devs made Wolfenstein: The New Order, and I can taste some of the influences. Taking cover, the guns feeling good... But while Wolfenstein was more like a hallway shooter, pushing you forward into levels constantly, Rage has a bit of an open world aspect. Not as vast as you'd hope, but big enough to rummage around and see the sights. However, mission handling and such always happen in cities and such. Even races.Races are moderately enjoyable, and are required to upgrade your vehicle. But all in all, they're not something that ultimately stands out as extremely enjoyable, but a good enough time waster if you feel like trying. The races vary from time trials, racing combat to hunting random checkpoints that appear on the map. The enemy AI, especially in high difficulties, can be a real challenge though. So if you want those achievements, maybe do those on a different difficulty.I found Rage a worthwhile experience. The combat and gameplay, which matters more to me, felt good. Most of the weapons fit archetypes that you should be familiar with, but most of their design fits the theme. Except the shotgun. Damn thing looks like a modern polished weapon in a world of rusty and dusted weapons. It doesn't look high tech either like the late game villain's weapons do. Odd one, that.The exploration and story could have been better, but the atmosphere is very well done. There's lots to do, a few things to gamble in a few games, and tasks to do. The people in the cities don't repeat their lines, and often have interesting things to say. Not to mention that they seem to be all named. As if they were placed by hand.If the positive aspects I've described call to you, then Rage may be a worthwhile experience for you as well. As a game of age, it'll now be more often on sale, so be sure to grab it at your convenience.And if you want a game where the combat also feels just as good, Wolfenstein: The New Order will be the next game I may heartily recommend.

												RAGE is a really fantastic post-apocaliptic world with great narrative. Here you've got a heavy loaded with guns buggy to destroy your enemies and race around.Useful system of creating items allows you to re-new your stuff easily. Some kinds of weapons and different bullets make your game more interesting and creative. You decide how to fight. Be a sniper and attack from afar or just kill'em all hard. This is worth to play...

												It's quite hard to review RAGEI wish steam had more options, it's not really ""Yes"", but it's definitely not ""No"" Graphics: it's not that bad, the sky is uhm... just a ""wallpaper"", a static texture, yeah, they worked hard... some textures are quite embarrassing and sadly it's glitchy too...  overall as I said, it's not pure trash, sometimes looks really nice. Music\Voice acting: nothing impressiveLocations: some locations are really nice, some locations are like ""Ehy I feel too lazy today, I'll just copypaste some random corridors, that's ok ?""Story: what I said about laziness ?  I can imagine what happened in ID's offices:""Ok people, let's add those... uhm groups of people here because of reasons, then this guy will ask you to go there to pick that item because... he... needs it ?! Ok then we'll add a giant in this point, because you know, giants are cool, Well then we can... oh guys it's lunch time, gotta go !"" ""But we have to write the final and..."" ""Nevermind, the final is simple, the protagonist goes somewhere and kills everyone and he saves Rohan, that's all""""Rohan ?"" ""Rohan, Megaton, Narnia, whatever, I'm late, Bye guys"" Gameplay - shooting: it's nice, a bit repetitive but nice. Great potential not really used by ID, again laziness, tons of corridors to clean, just a few different ""encounters"", nice weapons feeling, different ammo for each weapon, a lot of extra items, nice IAGameplay - driving: Ok, it's not awful... it's bad compared to the ""shooting gameplay"" and tbh it's quite useless, maybe with a better implementation...Gameplay - in general: the dialogue system it's pretty bad, invisible walls (you can't jump a ♥♥♥♥♥ rock, really ?!), subtitles... ok let's pretend subtitles don't exist, side quests are pretty meh, some minigames are nice, but nothing extraordinary. Overall: tons of defect, sometimes it feels like devs were too tired to take it seriously.RAGE it's a Fallout\Borderlands wannabe, but it fails. The game is good enough to be finished.RAGE could have been a masterpiece, but ID decided to not invest... actions and consequences, RAGE is just ok.			"

												Rage is the perfect example of how a bad launch can irreversibly ruin a game. When the game was first released in 2011, the ""mega textures"" looked great - when it worked. Most of the time, it didn't. That ruined the game for me, and apparently many others as well. Fast forward to 2015. With all the problems patched, Rage runs perfectly. Plus, it looks gorgeous - even by today's standards. In fact, I'd dare say Rage is the best looking FPS game in my opinion (even though The Order: 1886 and Battlefield have more amazing tech, Rage has incredible artistic direction).Pros- Great selection of guns - Guns feel real, weighty and powerful- Incredibly interesting cast of characters- Interesting, varied and intelligent/believable enemies- Amazing graphics, even by 2015 standards- Great level design with varied levels- Fun distrations around town (i.e. the game's hub area), including a surprisingly addictive card game- Good range of difficulty levels- DLC that's actually worth the price! Cons- Given the intersting array of characters, the story really doesn't live up to its potential- WAY too few boss battles- NO RAGE 2!! (Ok this isn't really a con, but we need a Rage 2!)In summary, this is one of the finest FPS games ever made. There isn't an epic story to be told, but if you love to shoot stuff - this is as good as it gets. Old school gunplay (without any modern ""gun carrying limit"" BS) with new school gameplay variety and graphics. Rage is a steal even at full price. If you're a fan of FPS games (or even if you're not), this is one game that needs to be in your collection.			"

												This isn't a bad game. I would compare the game's story to Blade Runner; They've created an interesting world that you want to see, but the story doesn't take advantage of that world as much as it could. Though, while the story is pretty lackluster and the ending is terrible, it has solid gameplay and level design which makes it worth playing in my opinion.Pros:-Enjoyable gameplay-Good level design-Co-op is fun-Very interesting and detailed worldCons:-Technical issues due to the engine (id tech 5)-The story and characters are pretty lame-The ending is incredibly anti-climactic-Not very difficult, even on the highest difficultyIf you like first-person shooters, you'll probably enjoy this. Just have low expectations for the story.			"

												From the perspective of a storyteller and lore junkie, RAGE is cause enough to RAGE. It seems to get the recipe right: Post-apocalyptic setting, competent voice acting, guns that are fun to fire, enemies that are fun to dispatch, huge cars with huge guns, and good graphics and sound work. So where it goes wrong?The world is dull. It's about as derivative as post-apocalyptic settings can get and simply boring. None of the characters are particularly memorable (except for Dan Hagar and that's only because he's voiced by John Goodman, whom I adore) and the setting is... To say it's barebones is to be generous. There's very little world building and it offers no cohesion, nothing beneath the wallpaper of pretty graphics and animations. You'd think Apophis' impact would create an unique setting with special mechanics, but as it stands, RAGE could very well stand in for a particularly sunny day in Fallout or a mysterious new Zone of Exclusion in a game based on Roadside Picnic (yes, I could stay STALKER, but that's not a direct adaptation, now is it?).Perhaps the worst offender is the Authority. You are constantly being told how the Authority is bad and evil, but the game never actually shows it beyond a handful of comments about hunting Ark survivors (who usually join them) and their leader doing a Bad Thing by messing with the Ark timers. Oh, and they wear red, black, faux-runes, and their flag is a barely modified Reichskriegsflagge. So, Nazis AFTER APOCALYPSE, fought by a Generic White Military Dude. As derivative and boring as the story is, the gameplay is pretty solid. Scrounging up supplies and crafting stuff to fight enemies more effectively is fun, the alternative ammunition adds variety (well, when it isn't a simple damage multiplier), and the foes you fight offer for a varied experience (with the caveat that they tend to be bullet sponges by the end game). Still, there are far better alternatives on the market. Far Cry comes to mind, which does everything RAGE purports to do, except better.			"

RAGE is such an amazing game, maybe not story wise but the gameplay, the world, the visuals, the women, it's all good.I enjoyed the game very much, as it is quite similar to games like Borderlands and Half Life when it comes to the plot.It is not the most original(est?) concept there is. You are a survivor from a worldwide apocalypse and you become to hero who saves the day. We've all seen it before. But the story never was the strong point of this game.It's the actual gameplay itself, combat is very satisfying and the game is visually VERY appealing. It also works flawlessly on toasters alike. RAGE isn't really open world either, well I mean, it does have open world aspects to it but I wouldn't consider it to be a true open world game like the other Bethesda titles such as the Elder Scrolls games and Fallout games.But i do like the fact that you are able to interact with almost every NPC there is and can do minigames that mostly consist of gambling. There is also racing and bounty hunting.Keeps the game interesting.. For some time that is. You see, the game itself is quite short.And to make you even more doubtful wether you should buy this game, the ending of this game (NO SPOILERS)is one of the worst I have ever seen. It's like they planned to release a sequel soon after, but never got around to doing so. That and the fact that the plot (story line) is confusing and hard to follow and often makes very little sense, are the only reasons not to buy this game in my opinion. But hey, it's always on sale and full priced at 9.99 USD currently. So i guess the length of the game is justified with the current price tag.There are also bunch of sidequests to do so that the game won't be done in under 10 hours.I would also recommend buying THE SCORCHERS DLCas it lets you continue the game after the original endingand gives you a new side story (quest) that will keep you busy for few hours. Also, as mentoned before, women in this game are extreme appealing to look at. And THE SCORCHERS adds another hottie to your collection.It's a fantastic game ruined by a ending that leaves you feel unsatisfied and gives no real closure, none-the-less i will still recommend it, considering how cheap the game is.

												Mr. Rebounding Health, I want to ask you something.  Are you ashamed at all of how badly you ruin tension, pacing, excitement, difficulty, level design and strategy in video game experiences?  I would have enjoyed RAGE immensely more had you not wiped your feet on the experience.  Okay, sure, the story, characters and ending were bland, but as a game, it's pretty good, and it's a beautifully optimized 10 - 16 hour experience.  The enemies are quite smart and evasive, I got to hold 10 weapons at once with varying ammo types and the baddies responded to where they were hit and were ultimately satisfying to kill.  Hell, even the driving portion of the game was phenomenal, so much so I actually couldn't wait to travel and participate in races.  Then you came in and took away what could have been intense, exciting combat and instead, gave me tunnel vision with how easy and ultimately dull you made the shooting.  Now, thanks to you, I can only half-heartedly recommend RAGE.  Thanks a bunch.			"

												This review is split in 2.Vanilla Game....great game, although a little on the easy side, even with Ultra Nightmare.  The hardest part of the game were the last 2 DLC levels with the Scorchers.  All in all, very fun game, great graphics, solid performance, and amazing shooting mechanics, as expected from ID.  Minigames are worth spending the time to play, and even though money is abundant, the side quests are fun to accomplish.  Racing mechanics are well done IMO, and i do not use a controller.  8/10Game with Rebalance mod 2.0......Oh my, this is what the game should have been.  It may not be fair to do a review of a game WITH a mod, but considering IMO this is how the game should have been i will include it.  ReMod2.0 makes items more expensive, ammo less powerful, and the regenerating health is GONE.  Engineering items is now essential to survival.  This mod + Ultra Nightmare is tough as nails and i loved every moment of it....9.5/10			"

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.I remember hearing and waiting for this game back in '08, Yeah, that's how long I've been waiting for this gameThe new engine is astounding. The textures are amazing, It is very nice to see a new engine and not some re-used or re-updated albeit old engine like Unreal 3.0do not expect this game to be open-worlded in the same sense that Fallout 3 are, The world seems large but you are only confined to small and medium sized areas. As you play, but this game is mostly linear. Once you discover several towns, you can do fast travelOverall: the game feels like playing a Mad Max movie with the elements of Borderlands, Fallout, and Some Metro 2033 elements. But that is not to say that any ideas were stolen or re-used for this game. Rage is its own kind of animal, it is unique and it's got plenty of peculiar styles. The world is believable and immersive.Highly recommended.			"

												Rage is fun to play, it's not a GOTY but it's a good FPS with some RPG elements: crafting, inventory. AI is really great, it's fun to see enemies and your robot(s) follow you, climb, hide, etc.You should totally play it, size can be problematic with slow or limited internet but it's a great experience ;) GraphicsThe graphics are good, but the texture caching is some time (most of time on dual monitor setup) a little ugly, if you see what I mean ... The Mega texture give good decors, but you can see that cars or rocks are paint on the texture (it's flat). Since it's Carmack, you can forget physics for objects: table, chair, some bottles are stick where they are.LengthThe game have a good length I've ~20 hours for the main story and side quest (the only things I haven't done are: little games (boring) and most of races). The last DLC add 2h30 of content, and you can still play after you've finish the main campaign. BTW it isn't a real open world, you can drive around, but you'll encounter many close doors and missions are in a close area each time: sewers, refineries, etc.SizeThe size on my hard drive is: 23814 Mo (with all the DLC: Authority pack, sewers and The Scorchers).

												I bought this on sale, which is the only way I would recommend it to others.The Shooter-bits are GREAT! Enemies run from grenades, react to flanking fire, and retreat. The acrobatic mutants roll and duck under your shots, and while returning fire.Graphics looked great for me. Some people complain about pop-in or sub-60 fps, so your mileage may vary.It's all the other stuff that is not very good - the  MANDATORY driving mini-games. The driving always feels... off. And for an ""open world"" experience, it doesn't feel very open at times. I figured once you knew where Subway Town and Wellspring were, you could drive betweeen the two, but you have to take a blimp. The Wastelands feel cramped (esp. near Subway Town).The abrupt ending is just slapped-on, and left a bad taste in my mouth. I was looking forward to a Big Boss Fight and then... nothing.

												This game is problematic. It's great all-around, but some of the complaints about it are warranted. The design is brilliant, but the execution just isn't quite up to snuff. Blowing off mutant heads is better than ever, and id has really kept up with the times. The gameplay here is completely unique to id. Some of the more blatant errors have to do with the balance of the weapons later on in the game. The machine gun/ironsight/cover play looks like it should work, even into the Gearheads lair, however this is not the case and suddenly you must change your strategy. Up until enemies get armor however, you can effectively just melee through the game if your aim is good enough. I was able to complete normal without purchasing bandages or saving mid-level, first time through the game. More subtle some of the maps don't make cover and terrain visually clear. Obstacles sometimes only come up to your knees, and you can jump over other stuff that's up to your thighs, it's a real pain to have to learn this in the middle of a firefight. Combat is not a place where you want to fool around with a player's ability to flow. Please only player clip for good, not evil.But these problems are far and away the exception, and not the rule. id is the best, this game is really quite good, and visually stunning. The uniqueness of the game far outdoes the slight problems with it. 10/10 would buy againps: this is one of a few fpses released in the last 5 years where the campaign isn't simply a drawn-out multiplayer tutorial. buy now!

												Addition to the review: I notice that a lot of people are saying my review isn't helpful, I am not saying this isn't a good game, in fact I quite enjoyed it when I played it on my 8800GTX, but the game has serious technical issues that hinder many people from playing the game and I have not found a fix that works. I can recommend the game itself because it is a lot of fun, just not on PC due to myself and everyone I know having SERIOUS issues with the game.RAGE... while it is a well done game, it is hindered by game breaking technical issues that they have not fixed and the game came out quite some time ago. If you read through the forums, you will find that a big problem with the game is the way that it caches textures with higher end graphics cards. This causes extreme pop ins for textures that really ruins how good this game looks and destroys your frame rate. This only seems to be an issue with higher end graphics cards. I have experienced this issue on the following cards: Nvidia 280GTX (and two of these in SLI), Nvidia 560 GTX, Nvidia 560 Ti, and the Nvidia 660 Ti. Normally I wouldn't bash on a game for an issue like this but for it to be such a massive and common issue really ruins this game and I can't say I would recommend it to anyone with a higher end rig because of this. Now if you have a lower end rig (ran this without any issues on a Nvidia 8800 GTX), you may be able to run this game without any problems but unfortunately there are no guarantees. I cannot recommend anyone buy this unless they are willing to roll the dice with this broken game. I really hope id Software can step it up after losing John Carmack and fix this engine. Go play it on consoles if you are dying to play it, you can probably get the Anarchy Edition at your local Walmart or EB Games for $20 or less on PS3 or 360.			"

OverallWell, it is not a bad game. At least better than most of its era, but do not expect too much from it.It displays to you as a open word free roaming fps with car races, crafting, and a lot of collateral activities, more like mini-games.The game has indeed all of this features, but no one of them is deepened enought in durability e quality.They just put a bunch of different stuff together and developed them enought to make them look long and complex enought to persuade the casual player they are good and many, therefore this game is immense and cool!I bet every Hardcore player noticed that and reacted as I did.So, don't be surprised if you find reviews that describe this game as conceived to be a demo for their graphic engine more than a game itself, or to be an ""introduction"" to post-apocaliptic games for newbies.That was an overall, now let me talk about some details and the reason why i liked or disliked them.-----------------------------------------------------------------------GraphicsAgain, game for casual players therefore worths to spend half of the budget on it.It is really cool indeed, expecially textures of the rocks. The game is plenty of rocks and I really liked the way they look.FPS weaponsThat is actually the main element of the game. If you speed-run it you will spend 90% time shooting and ony 10% in racing and exploring. There is nothing particular here, you got the canonical set of weapons. Only thing is you can craft and find different kind of ammo for some of them. Three or four of them transforms your weapon in a different one. Well, actually this happens mainly with the shotgun, who can become a granade launcher or a laser rifle. Nice feaure, not deepened enought, like everything else.FPS fightsThe game is linear, but if there is something I liked it was the enemies AI. Most of them just run recklessly to you screaming and swinging their weapon, but they attemps to dodge your shoots, with jumps, flips, preventive dodges, almost of the times successfully! It gives you a reason to sharpen your reflexes and don't waste (too much) ammo.CraftingYou have less then twenty recipes in the hole game, including an handful that is an enhanced version of a previous project.Considering you have cod-like health recover, 2 charges of respawns that recharge in a minute or less, and lot of weapons, what makes you think crafting a wingstick (kind of a boomerang) or a bandage is of any need?Also some of them are not balanced. Let me tell you of the auto-turret which enemies will knock over istantly! You can place it and literally count up to three to find the turret on the ground, totally useless.INSTEAD there is the sentry-bot that is definety overpowered! It a spider-like robot with a machinegun that is hard to kill, hard to hit, can even melee attack, follows you like a pet, extremely powerful, efficient, and with perfect aim. You can drop it on the ground an almost make him finish part of levels for you! Oh, it costs as much as the turret.And lastly, the remote controlled explosive car! This is a fun one because enemies will see it immediately and one-shot kill it, no matter the distance. It is also has a short range explosion. 'Nuff said.ExplorationTotally useless. You actually have only a city and the arounds that includes entrances to fps levels, and race tracks. No reason to hang in there. Also, jumping (on feet) is useless: there are barriers everywhere and it is impossibile to try to be in places where you are not supposed to be. I literally counted that only ONE TIME I needed to jump to reach a place.CharactersThis is really a great point for this game! Every character is characterized, on its design, voice, way they talk, and they fight (if enemy). I really like of colourful this game is on this point of view, and even be surpriced of how much an npc can be detailed even if you meet only once.RacingVery simple but fun. Consider races more like kart-games-fashioned destruction derbys.MultiplayerWell, it's dead now, but i remember I played in 2013. It was focused on car races. They were fun, but the ease you unlock all the contents and the total lack of skill of players constantly pushed me to think devs already know it would be dead quickly. I even felt the lack of ambition in making something long-lasting.LongevityI beat the game in around 20 hours, consider it a completionist time. I am not surpriced if I'll hear of some speed-runner that beats the game in 4 hours or less. With my total time of 40 hours (including multiplayer) I think I long passed the expectations on longevity of developers.PlotI should say ""spoilers ahead"" but there is not much story to spoil. Plot is a disaster and you totally realize only when you beat the game.Story: Earth is destroyed by a meteorite (surpriced it was not a nuclear war). You were cryogenized and wake up in this post-apocalypse future. You are saved by a nice tought guy that only for coincidence was in that recondite place you were. There is the Authority who dictates the wolrd (even if it is not true). You join the resistance, then you literally just enter the Authority core base and press some buttons. No final boss fight. No horde of guards to stop you. Not even a red alert situation. Not even a out-field voice of the bad guy that curses you or a call from friends to tell you saved the world. Just that: buttons-cinematic-credits. You have done your job now GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE people have to work, ♥♥♥♥♥♥! That was my impression on ending. Also for 80% of the game you just do what you do because you can, no plot involvement.------------------------------------------------------------------------ConclusionsI bought it for 3,50€ while on sale in 2013. Today its full price is 10€ so it can easily be even cheaper.If you spend as much as I did and don't expect too much, you won't be disappointed.			"

												I remember when Rage was a highly anticipated title. The follow up to Doom 3 that was years in the making. When Rage came out the reviews were pretty mediocre. At least for a shooter that took years of development by the guys that mastered the genre.  Nothing really appealed to me about Rage, I'm not the biggest fan of ""open world"" games and the post apocalyptic setting has been done to death. But on a whim I decided to install Rage and a couple hours I was still playing it. Needless to say it a huge surprise this was me.  The good? The game looks amazing (though less so with up close textures) and ran smooth as butter on my OK PC. The gunplay is awesome. Tons of weapons and each has a distinct and satisfying feel. There is tons of stuff to do. Take contracts, race for upgrades, minigames or build things to help you kill stuff. Rage has you covered. The bad? Yes, the abrupt ending is indeed terrible and screams for a sequel (which will probably never come). Apparently the game was designed with a controller in mind because selecting turrets, grenades etc is wonky and not explained to you how to do it (Hold the F1 key, mouse click what you want to use). The racing parts I thought were only OK. Overall though I had a ton of fun with Rage. The $9.99 MSRP is absolutely worth it. A sale makes it an even better value. And definitely get The Scorchers DLC. There you get an actual boss fight at the end which was really well done. Even with its imperfections, Rage gets an 8.5/10 from me.			"

												You would think with such big names behind it as Bethesda, id Software, and Square Enix, this title would be well worth its playtime in cash; unfortunately this is not the case. While the game-play is about as fun as any other post apocalyptic sandbox and the art is certainly a drawing factor, it is simply not all that fun to play. It is surprising just how quickly I found myself getting annoyed at the ""go fetch this"" quests and overall clunky mechanics behind some of the tasks. The challenge is not apparent on any difficulty and areas that are marked by NPCs warning of the dangers that lie ahead are little more than small scripted events where you fight a dozen enemies one at a time.That is not to say this is a terribly made game though. It delivers a mad max kind of vibe that seems to be trying to pull off some off mix of Elder Scrolls: Oblivion mixed with Borderlands. Quests, while predictable and somewhat unchallenging, offered some form of story progression and content delivery. Side missions like the racing ones featured in this game offer an interesting and fun diversion from the redundant primary mission progression, but were short lived and quickly showed their redundant nature as well.All in all I really wanted to like this game. Everything I experienced within the world Rage presents left me wishing it was good, but like any polished junk, at the end of the day it is still junk. 4/10 Buy at your discretion.			"

												Gameplay wise I really enjoyed RAGE. Its a nice mix of solid shooter mechanics with racing thrown in. It mixes up the experience and keeps the game feeling interesting throughout. The gunplay really shines here. Standard fair weapons with some uniques, but each with unique ammo types and functions that feel very satisfying to use. The explosive shotgun shell rounds for instance, or the electric bolts for the crossbow to name a few. Gadgets like the wingstick are fun as well. Combat is almost always in small corridors. Larger areas are mainly for travel or vehicle comat. Its not a bad thing but rarely will you ever do your fighting out in the wilds. The racing aspect feels pretty decent. Its got some fun challenges and upgrading your car is fun as well. It mixes the pacing up which I enjoyed. Graphics wise it has a uniuqe look. They use the mega texture technology to have no ""repeating tiling textures"" and for a more unique look. It does look very good, but it it lacks in other areas such as dynamic lighting, decent shadows, and high resolution textures. Still its got a very unique look compared to other games. Now the game is not perfect at all. The story and characters are very poor. The story barely exists at all. Some HUD features are obviously from the console and the game could make much better use of PC options. Standard PC features like mouse smoothing and FOV have to be changed via console or autoexec.cfg files. Really sad in this day we still get this crap from devs. Challenge is another problem. Im not an amazing gamer, but I played on hard and didnt have a hard time with anything except a couple encounters. Still in the end once you get your FOV and mouse set, and are playing the game its a great experience. Very fun simple good old fashion shooting with some racing to spice it up. Really recommend espicially now when its so cheap and is 5 bucks on sale every other month or so.			"

												I finished RAGE two days ago, and I've spent the time since thinking about it. If you've read the other reviews of this title, you'll have seen the most common complaints:- no ending. The game just stops.- no character development- no explanations or justification for what you're doing- no real plot- no ability to resume playing the rest of the game once the main quest line is over- persistent graphics pop-ins- somewhat awkward save interface- very awkward weapon and inventory interfaceMy biggest complaint is that the game is clearly not finished. Playing the game in 2016 and most of the bugs are fixed, but this still leaves the gaping problems in the way the game works. To quote Shigeru Miyamoto, ""a delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad"". How I wish that John Carmack and friends had spent a little longer fleshing it out. Then, RAGE might feel like a more viable proposition. As it is, once the game has abruptly ended, you will feel cheated. Cheated that you spent time strategising when no strategy is needed. Cheated that you spent time economising when no economy is needed. Cheating that you spent time improving when no improvement is needed.Save your money, buy a different game. "

												Borderlands lite done in a realistic style. Bad:ID tech 5 games work on pc, but inexplicably are not set up to work properly from the start- so you have to apply a fix.Story is pretty minimal and often ridiculous. Not as open or long as Borderlands. Not as long as originally envisioned, feels like the ending could have been better.Good:Scorchers DLC adds a lot with a cool weapon and some variety to the environments. Overall this game is pretty and fun,  and the weapons are cool and do get upgrades and different ammo. Great shooting mechanics, ai gunplay, and the racing / combat racing is fun. Solid shooter, try it on sale.			"

												Rage has some interesting parts, but the package as a whole is a mess. The color of the world is dreary but every NPC you meet is somewhat cheery and treats you like their best friend. While I love racing games and did not expect realistic vehicle behavior, Rage's MarioCart-like take is off the wall arcade. The power ups add more chaos to the racing that's already silly in comparison to the shooting. Even the shooting isn't all that good. The AI is interesting in that it seems to react to the situation, yet it's still dumb and easy to defeat. Bad missions, bad driving, and a setting that isn't coherent and reminds me that there are other similar games with much better story and tone. There's probably a lot of games that have been and may be $5 on sale that I would take over Rage. The Rocket Rally races are just random nonsense where there's no consequence for dying and bares no relation to the rest of the game. I either end up playing whack-a-mole as enemies pop out from cover or just walk up to them with a shotgun when they are crouched. Mutants you just wait for them to run straight at you.			"

RAGE: an enjoyable and visually pleasing, Mad Max inspired first person shooter with some Borderland style vehicular action thrown into the mix.The GoodGraphics are on point as is to be expected from Id. NPCs are nicely detailed and there are some awesome vistas but sadly some textures don't look as good from up close. Character animations are amazing.The gunplay feels sharp and controlled. Weapons are interesting and can use different types of ammo. RAGE has an open world feel to it, even though it's essentially a linear shooter. Different areas are connected through a central wasteland that you navigate with your vehicle. Id succeeds in making this game feel big.The BadOne of the downsides is the console influence. There are quite a lot of invisible walls. The health regen system is present to make fights more forgiving (even a resurrection system like Borderlands)  and the game menus are clunky to navigate with your mouse.The racing aspect feels a bit forced and unnecessary and the same can be said about the crafting system. On the other hand, they work fine and give some slight advantages to the player. (Fat Mammas!)There is not a lot of variation in the enemy and monster line up. This creates a certain repetition. "

												-Description-Story:The asteroid called 99942 Apophis is on a collision course for Earth and it will hit the planet at August 23, 2029, destroying civilization as we know it. The only hope for humanity to survive this event is to burrow down to ground with these Arks and submerge when the Earth is habitable again.  You are one of those survivors who were selected to enter one of the Arks. You submerge from the ground in the year 2135, only to notice that all your fellow Ark colleagues to be dead from the Ark malfunction and that the Earth has become a savage place, filled with raiders, mutants and things that has a dendency to kill you.The main story is somewhat average. It starts very strongly and keeps you in its grasp, but the ending was a little disappointment and anti-climatic for me. Not only that, but the ending also had a huge cliffhanger.Gameplay:The game is somewhat similar to the Borderline series, mixed with some Fallout's apocalyptic atmosphere. You can scavenge the world for items, which you can then use to build different items, depending what recipes you've discovered.The game has main quest line which you can follow, but there are also several side quests, which offers you money that you can then spend at vendors for items and car parts.Pros:+ Apocalyptic world and locations+ Infranty and vehicle mechanics+ Vendor system+ Crafting system+ Interesting characters+ Strong story, but...Cons:- ...Anti-climatic and gliffhanger ending- Main story is kinda short- Lack of character progression- Stealth gameplay could have been better- Not as challenging as I would have hopedDo I recommend?Yes. It has it's shortcomings, but if you enjoy playing apocalytic games, you'll probably enjoy this one too.Verdict: 8 / 10 - Good game( 1 = do-not-bother game5 = average game10 = must own game)			"

												After raging so hard on those mini game achievements, I decided to play this game again and let me tell you, it was awesome! Sure, the game has problems. Texture pop ups, performance issues, horrible ending, not being able to control the camera while driving etc. All of these can be overlooked because the game has a fantastic atmosphere, great gameplay, cool weapons, great musics and some nice RPG elements. Oh and also it has amazing graphics. Ending is probably going to disappoint you but it is still worth playing if you love post-apocalyptic games, shooters, looting or games with awesome visuals.

												I really, really wanted to love this game but instead I could only like it. Post apocalyptic shooting with vehicles and open world elements from the people that made Quake, sounds fantastic right? That's until you actually start playing. You're dropping into the world with the barest amount of exposition and rescued by John Goodman who within five minutes of meeting you, gives you a gun and asks you to wipe out a gang. Vehicles don't exist beyond mini-games and the odd moments where you need to traverse relatively short distances to mission ""dungeons."" You ultimately join the rag tag group known as ""The Resistance"" who fights against the tyrannical ""Authority"" (honestly guys, hire a writer and come up with better names) in the most cliched manner possible. The game does have it's standouts. The gunplay feels good, the animation is excellent and blowing up other cars is enjoyable. The characters are very well constructed and they make you want to just sit and talk with them but instead are used as one-shot interactions. John Goodman's character disappears after the first hour of the game. The game was unfortunately not everything I wanted it to be but it was still an enjoyable experience.Get it for $5 if you have a rainy weekend.			"

												I feel this game is very under-rated and under-appreciated. My first contact with this game was thanks to my local Game store where I picked this up second hand for only £4 (xbox 360) early last year. Within the first 5 minutes of playing I was completely absorbed and I fell in love hard. I've since had to re-purchase the game via Steam for another nostalgic playthrough and I don't regret it one bit. The game is based in the future amongst a wasteland filled with survivors, mutants, monsters and patrol units, not to mention bandit cars. You play a character that has crashed down to the wasteland from an intelligent craft which pre-dates the war. The war that is, that turned the land into wasteland in the first place. With your andvanced Ark technology implants and a funky selection of arsenal, you play through to liberate the wasteland and help the survivors as best as you can. Shotgun, machine gun, cross bow, sniper rifle and grenade launcher are some of the weapons that the character can play with throughout the game. My personal favourite are 'boomsticks', a boomering shaped object with blades that can be thrown to cut through advancing enemy heads with the chance of the stick returning to you for another throw. The story line and game start of very well but honestly I found the middle and ending not to live up to the first half. It was good, it was full of action but I just felt there should have been more, a bigger climax. Still I think it is well worth a play for any fps game fans. Plus it also has bonus games inside such as car racing (and fighting) plus gambling games ie cards, dice, roulette. Also has optional side missions. "

OverviewsighOkay, this was a tough one to rate. I gave it a ""yes"", but hear me out first: It's good if you're expecting DOOM, with a tiny bit of open world that was injected in. If you're actually looking for a game based on it being open world, then this is not the game for you.This is DOOM. With the added freedom of a tiny bit of exploration (though there's not much to discover... at all) and some racing aspects, which was.... fine, let's say.My reasoningLet's just go through the cons first.* Graphics, although nice, were poorly executed (ie. pop-ins)* The ""open world"" isn't much of an open world. At all.* The characters had SO MUCH potential, but they all ended up kind of dull. Like some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 90's caricature, but without much personality.* Story wasn't very interesting, and didn't have much explained.* Without spoiling anything for you, the ending was... well.... it wasn't much of an ending. I was saving up all my best weapons, and then suddenly... the game's over. It did not feel like an ending. No boss fight. The final quest felt like just any other side quest.With that aside, I want to say that, with the exception of that last point, as well as the point about texture pop-ins, those flaws are okay and can be overlooked.. IF you treat the game like DOOM. I played it on nightmare difficulty, and I have to say it was just as fun as DOOM itself. It really was. It also came with a few mini-games which I thought were also terrific. The racing aspect of it is no Need For Speed, but it's still a nice addition, and was enjoyable.So to recap: if you're looking for something like Fallout, turn away now. If you're looking for something like DOOM, however, I highly recommend it.			"

												I Bought RAGE on it's release day because id Software. I'm still a fan of theirs after over 20 years. Don't know why exactly all the time, but yet I am.I was somewhat disappointed with RAGE. Sure, it looks nice at times, but for all the hype and fervor preceding the launch, it was a rather big let down on the overall gaming experience.If you are a fan of id Software's games, I do recommend RAGE. It's not a greatest game out there, but it has it's moments. If, on the other hand you are short of time and crave for some truly great entertainment, there are better options.Pros:- The action, at times- The idea and potential for the story- Pretty post apocalyptic scenery and semi-comic imageryCons:- The, oh, so very static world. Not a cloud moves in the sky.- Race grinding.- Was there a main story? I can't remember. If there was, it was really unremarkable and bland. (Oh, wait, I am mistaken. I do remember the story. It really is unremarkable and bland.)- The sounds and overall feeling of the weapons. Since the Doom 3 failure, why cannot they get those right? (This is a minor issue though.)			"

												This will get a positive mark for 2 reasons, which are probably only worth it if Rage is on sale.  One and one thing only made this game an absolute blast for me, too bad I didn't discover it until the end of the game after I'd already beaten the game and loaded a save before the last mission to complete all the side quests and Sewers DLC.That one thing is the Dynamite Bolts for the crossbow!  I'll explain at the end.  The game and the world looked pretty good.  The gameplay, guns and quessts were just interesting enough to keep playing, but ultimately I was disappointed.  When Rage first came out, I remember all the commercials and such that kept showing these big epic battles versus these huge nightmarish creatures, and these epic ""fight for your life"" vehicle battles.  But these mechanics either fell flat or were almost non-existant. Overall, the vehicle stuff was boring.  It's easy to max out your vehicle's equipment and armor via the ""racing"" mechanic and once you've done that you are pretty much unstoppable when driving around the wastes.  I resorted to ramming into enemy vehicles while holding the Boost button to make enemy cars explode, just to make it interesting.Worse, is the fact that all those adverts suggesting that the game was littered with epic fights against these huge monsters, was in fact only ONE epic fight against ONE monster at the end of ONE particular quest.  In fact, that quest was the ONLY really fun and cool quest in the entire game as you always find yourself constantly encountering said creature as it lumbers/rampages through the city.  You always seem on the verge of getting caught, noticed, or accidentally killed by its random actions until you finally encounter him at the end and are forced to fight.  The whole atmotsphere and feel of that entire level was absolutely fantastic.  If the developers has made the whole game feel like this quest, I think people would have loved this game.The Problem:  This one quest is maybe halfway into the game.  The final objective that ends the game is downright dull and boring by comparison.  Yes, as everyone says, the end doesn't even feel like the end and is completelyh anti-climatic.    If only the developers had made the end game as exciting as the Epic Monster Quest Battle I talked about in the previous paragraph.Dynamite Bolts!  The one thing that that made me not go ""meh"" over the game, maybe second thing if I include the 1 Epic Monster quest.  I had largely ignored the different bolt types for the crossbow other than the basic one for stealth sniping.  But as I was going through and just completing all the sidequests (don't know why I cared), I got bored using the same guns/ammo over and over.  So to change things up and make things a bit more interesting I swapped to the killing from medium range distance with the dynamite bolts.  This is wherre hilarity insued.  The bolts hit their target and then explode after a few seconds.  It was easy to use them on human npc's because they tend to use cover and shoot from a disance, unlike mutants who charge you causing you explsive damage.  Anyways, I found out that if you use the dynamic bolts, the npc's get scared when hit.  Once they get hit, they yell things like ""Oh No!"" or ""Son of a B----!"" or ""Oh Sh--!""   Most of the time the npcs physically react to the bolt and start running around in a frenzy, or his buddies try to scramble away. Sometimes the individual body parts react to where he was hit.  So hitting a bandit in the arm could make him start flailing the arm wilding around, yelling ""Oh Sh--!"" then explode.  Some times the explosions lead to these ""laugh out load' ragdoll glitches where the npc body would catapult across the map, or smack another npc, knocking him over to act woozy from damage, etc.  After I discovered this, I spent the rest of the night laughing uncontrollably as bad guy after bad guy experienced the horror of my Crossbow of Kaboom! The one Epic quest and Dynamite bolts made this game worth the $4.99 Steam Sale.			"

												It's not the id Software game everyone had expected. The mega texture technology is not the next revolution everyone had thought. It's not a typical id Software fps and not a milestone in gaming history. BUT... it's a solid fps with open world elements in a post apocalyptic world.  "

												A game with a bipolar mix of great ideas and some pretty heavy misses. I'll start off with the good, get into the mixed, then get into the bad. Overall, though, I think it's a great game.So, the game starts off with a pretty epic cinematic of an asteroid hitting earth. You are one of the chosen few to be put into a life-sustaining pod of sorts to be released when it's safe to live again. How lucky! Everyone else in the pod died. Not lucky. In the meantime, civilization has adapted to a post-apocalyptic scenario by survivng in small pockets of the wasteland. Some people mutated, others formed gangs, and others complain about ""the authority"" being a general pain in the ♥♥♥. Really, they're called ""the authority."" This is the entire plot of the game.The gameplay is actually great! I had followed this game for about three years before its release, and I soaked up the tidbits that they released of their design philosophy. Carmack really admired Half Life 2's weapons, in that the sound they made gave you a real sense of how powerful they are. I think the weapons are one of the best parts of this game. The shotgun has bass, and it LOOKS beautiful. The crossbow looks like a technological marvel, and the sound portrays silent but deadly. Even the crappy starter pistol portrays ""Yeah, this gun is crap but it'll get the job done for the first few stages."" Also, all of the weapons are fun to use. There aren't many (they all fit neatly on the 0-9 keys), but they're well done.My favorite part of the inventory is a wingstick. It's a bladed tri-tipped boomerang with a target acquisition microchip. You sling it out (like a boomerang) and it'll do its best to locate and subtly track an enemy near your crosshairs when you threw it. Sometimes it'll bounce off walls and still manage to behead an enemy. Sometimes it'll break on the enemy and knock the wind out of them. Sometimes it cuts their head clean off and returns to you, ready to be thrown again. It's the best secondary weapon I've ever used in a video game, in both functionality and fun.Additionally, they spent a lot of time creating a wide range of possible movements for enemies. This means that enemies are, by and large, unpredictable. The same kind of mutant will stagger and roll in one way, while another will duck, jump, roll, and then try to hit me with a stick. Also, they die in different animations. It's not as dramatic as id said (""you won't see the same animation twice"" was really overshooting it) but it's nice detail.Also, the car aspect of the game deserves a lot of praise. It's post-apocalypse, so of course everyone attached rocket launchers to their cars. You get homing rockets, and can explode bandits' cars - and the explosions are beautiful. The cars also handle really well with a controller. To be honest, this game's car sequences could have been an amazing game on their own. You have a regenerating speed boost, you have kneecapper tires, upgradable car armor, multiple cars to pick from, car races (time trial, normal race, rocket combat race, and a neat kind of ""point"" race). The game left me wanting more of the car content.Now, for the mixed...It's clear the devs didn't really know what they wanted this game to be. It's a fun FPS with a really fun driving experience, but the racing aspect kind of gets dropped after an hour of gameplay (at which point driving just gets you to the next FPS objective). Also, it wants to take itself really seriously as a shooter. Stealth? Aww yeah, wingsticks and the crossbow are silent, go ahead and have fun - the game actually explicitly encourages it. Except there have been multiple occasions where I've been sneaking and enemies know the split second an ally silently dies across the room, or enemies in one area KNOW where I am and where I will be coming from even though I'm crouching silently. This is paint-by-the-numbers stealth. You'll stealth where the game wants you to stealth, and even that is kind of half-baked. The crossbow is fun but just not viable unless it's the first enemy in an area, which is a shame.Next, the areas are VIVIDLY beautiful. They've put so much effort into making detailed canyon lighting, ambient graffiti and statues, and just general neat touches that make everything come alive. But everything looks good from a distance. When you get up close, you'll notice the textures have this weird black dot patterning (examples are in my public RAGE screenshots). I'm running a ""great"" (RAGE-rated) Nvidia GPU with the latest drivers. I think it's just an afteraffect of id's grand idea of ""megatextures"" which seems to have been ahead of its time. That's another topic, and I won't get into it - this paragraph pretty much sums up its relevance. There's also massive texture pop-in if you use mouselook, and that's never been resolved. Oh well.Last, but not least, the bad parts of the game...Areas are shockingly linear. You will see slabs of rock that are reasonably sized for jumping. You will see paths in levels that you could reasonably assume you could go down.  Maybe there are a few doors you could force open, or something you could climb if you actually tried. No. The game has ONE path that you will always take, and it's frustrating. The game is about exploration in story, but it's really not in actual gameplay. This is made worse by the fact that they hide collectibles - cute nods to past id games, collectible cards to boost your ego, and crystals meant to be sold for money - off the beaten path. Actually, not so much ""off the beaten path"" but ""on the one path you're allowed, to the side where you have no reason to look."" Again, it's ""exploration by the numbers."" You'll explore the way they want you to. Even in a town, you can't save time by jumping around. You need to walk down the stairs, down that one corridor, down the other stairs - it's like I'm playing a responsible citizen simulator. Let me jump 10 feet over those stairs. Let me jump this 2 ft high wall along the corridor. I need to waste so much time wandering around a town with no guidance, the least you could let me do is save some time.Next, the game will just NOT work on an AMD GPU. On release it worked with terrible performance, and within a few patches (and despite tweaking it as much as I could) the game would NOT run on a mid-level AMD GPU. The game relies on CUDA cores. If you're not playing with an Nvidia GPU, you're going to have a hard time. They never fixed that.Also, the game was sold with the promise of day-one mod support, which was an outright lie. Mod tools were not made public available for (iirc) three years after the game's launch. If there was day-one support, as promised and advertised, the community could have done some wonderful things here. As it stands, it seems that most people have just moved on from this game, and that's honestly a shame. Based on the footage they released, the mod tools looked great.The last gripe I have with this game is the multiplayer. Let's see. id software...kings of the FPS genre. A FPS game. That means the multiplayer is going to obviously be...half-baked vehicle combat!! Wait, what? There's no kind of TDM or even just campaign co-op (although I think this is undoubtedly best done as a single-player experience). Instead, the game has vehicle combat in circular maps, which is really an odd direction for it to have taken. I know that I praised vehicle gameplay, but this doesn't relate to any kind of racing. It's literally car deathmatch free-for-all, which is enjoyable up to a point, but really just ill-fitting as the only multiplayer offering. There's also co-op in a number of sort of vignettes of game areas stripped of context and filled with tough enemies. That's cool, I guess. There was never really any driving force to try that other than achievements (and even at that, I just gave up on it). The game's multiplayer has been dead since three months after the game's release, so...			"

												Now, i just want to start out by saying, the PC port in this game is awful, if you have a console, you should get it there, but if texture rippling doesn't bother you, than let's get started.Rage is a very great breath of fresh air for FPS games, It blends in nice open levels inside the overall world design of the game. You can have up to 4 weapons equipped at times, and they all feel powerful and immensely satisfying, They have complex recoil movements and different weapons are used for different situation. It's FPS aspect is fun, frantic, and intense, though you will be finding yourself covering behind objects a bit too frequently.The Graphics are very well done, the objects and everything looks good in the game, but you may need some help from mods to get rid of the texture rippling.The story is the weakest point of this game, as you play the game, it is backed up by either way too generic characters, or promising ones that you barely get any dialogue from. Even though the world is somewhat decent in size and filled with crowds. It felt rushed and unfinished, and put together at the last second.But, the game is good overall, i never usually put scores on games, but since this review is a bit crazy, i would give it a 7.75/10			"

												Very generic story nowadays with your character waking up in a post apocalyptic wasteland, going against ""The Authority"". The influence from Fallout and other similar games is readily apparent. However playing this game, as with most ID software games, for the story isn't the point! The weapons are fun, sound good, and I like the different ammo/things you can craft to aid in killing things. Although some of the textures in game can be messy, the facial animations and attention to detail there is quite good. Would recommend this game when it goes on sale with the Scorcher's DLC. For approx $5, great deal for the amount of content. Not the most amazing game, but fun for fans of the FPS genre.			"

												Despite being a game I can recommend, this is a really interesting, nuanced title. A retro offering in more ways than one, it is crucially retro in the way that it is simply not a perfect, uber-polished shooter, and that this becomes a virtue as it delivers a title that stands out from the crowd, has a point of difference and, if one is prepared to compromise somewhat, a real charm.So what do I mean by RAGE being a retro, unpolished title? Well, let's look back to the first half of the 00s. This was a time when, before a relateively select span of companies (EA, Bethesda, etc) begun to dominate the industry, there existed a teir of titles that is somewhat less evident these days. A sort of B-teir, these games were identifyable by their newbie or unknown developers, somewhat strange production objectives, relatively unoptimised or scratchy graphics, etc.Take a look at Operation Flashpoint. Produced by Eastern europeans, the game was by no means a beautiful, watertight package. Don't get me wrong, as I said in my OpFlash 2 review the original Flashpoint was the best title in the whole of the ARMA and Flashpoint series combined, but this game was not perfectly made! Cutscenes and set pieces were all built within the simplistic mission editor engine, the English language script was iffy, models were boxy and only vaguely humanoid, textures were cloudy and the foliage was all just a collection of two-dimensional sprites arrayed rotationally around a Z-axis. Everything looked vaguely amateur, especially when held up against a game like Halo: Comabt Evolved, but as I've been hinting at thus far this was by no means an indictment of the gameplay experience: Operation Flashpoint was an era-defining, industry-leading title in it's own, specialised ways.And while RAGE does take on the look of a AAA title, at least in screenshots, it is in actually a half-baked, simplistic, technologically incomplete offering. It is an experiment for the IDTech 5 engine which, while a success in certain targetted areas, is by no means a holistic gaming experience.So why am I recommending it? Because it is a really fun, lightweight, occasionally stunning and even thrilling title.First of all a word on the graphics. This engine is obviously an intellectual triumph. Famous ID mastermind John Carmack came up with some magic method that allowed game artists to basically do whatever they wanted with a setting at no cost to performance, and the result of these innovations in RAGE is that it is a bloody georgeous game - at least when viewed in stills. Landscapes simply cannot be faulted, nor can the really intelligent way that lighting has been handled: this game can be really breathtaking.The environments, the lighting, even the movements of the characters are all really well done - but it isn't perfect. Character models move in a really expressive way, but the way they distort to accomodate this movement is somehow unrealistic and spoils immersion. Likewise the pace with which you move through environments, and the relatively low attention you are asked to pay to them (it plays like a rail shooter more often than not), prevents you from truly appreciating them and feeling as if you are part of an environment. In sum, and this is a point that highlights the quirkiness of this title: The game looks great, until you're playing it, then the visuals become forgettable until you stumble upon the occasional well-made set view.The gameplay is also pretty simplistic. Intended clearly to be a vehicle-heavy game, there are races and Mad Max-style road battles featuring limited vehicle physics and auto-aim guns. The shooting play is solid - greatly boosted by the elusive movements of your impish enemies which make aiming a really active experience - but repetetive. Missions are short and not too difficult (though occasionally you come up against big bad enemies who can be a real exclamation point) and in general there is a really light touch on the gameplay on the part of the creators (you would have expected more from Bethesda), something which isn't called for, since the gameplay is so clearly lacking something.So, I'll have to meld this hodge-podge review into a coherent final statement: This is a great, lightweight game. Get it when it's on sale. Get it for your weaker laptop to play on international flights. Get it for the fun gameplay, get it for the occasionally stupendous visuals, get it for the very low drain the game will exert on your mental resources. Don't get it if your machine can play Witcher 3, or somesuch, and can afford those games too.7/10			"

												Underrated gem. Yes, the story is full of cliches and isn't very interesting. Yes, the ending is dissapointing. Yes, the textures could have been better. However... It is very fun to play when it comes to shooting stuff - it has that old school touch that makes wielding weapons so satisfying. Combine that with an interesting enemy behaviour and on higher difficulties it can make gunfights rather challenging, yet still enjoyable. I can also say that I did find some joy in racing and driving around.If you can get RAGE for 5$ it's really a no-brainer.			"

												Surprisingly brief. It is a great shooter/racer with alot of little mini games you can have fun with from the battle card game you can play to the hand knife roulette type game all the way to the simple guitar memory game. I found crafting and the battle areas also to be quite fun. Ok now for the down side, The game was buggy as hell when I first picked it up but it got less buggy after some graphics card driver updates. I never once met the mysterious general running the bad guys, The last battle was also more of a gauntlet with no actual boss fight to speak of. Kinda left me surprised and disappointed. It actually felt like the game lost funding and so they just ended it with a happy ending cut scene. Do I recommend it? Yes but know what you are getting into and try to get it on sell. Right now it is 4.99 on the summer steam sale and that is a good price for it. Enjoy it while you can and make it drag out as much as you can but it will end. If you want a better game, get Borderlands (any of them), won;t be as visually impressive but will be more fun and complete and less buggy.			"

												Despite the hugely anti-climatic ending that WILL leave you disappointed, Rage is a very under appreciated game, that got a lot of hate due to its crappy PC port on release. Most of the problems it had were fixed, but it still feels like a console game. And playing on PC, that is unacceptable.  If you're able to get past the graphical issues, Rage is a very well made game. Think of Borderlands but without the RPG stuff: that is Rage. At first it may seem like an average game, but as you play it you'll discover that it's a lot of fun and it has a strange charm that will hook you up before you know it. I can't tell where that charm comes from, because thinking back, it's not better than similar games like the mentioned Borderlands, but it's still fun, which is what matters when playing a game.  Sure, it's rough around the edges, not for perfectionists, but if you play a game to enjoy it, trust me, you will like this game. Also, if you have the chance, get the Scorchers DLC, it makes the game better and adds content to the endgame, which the original was missing.			"

												Having played 690 plus hours of this game (so far) confirms my total commitment to another brilliant production from the id people.  The fact that you can enjoy not only different difficulty levels but also vary your playing direction every time you start a new game is a bonus. Yes, you must follow the given format to complete tasks and levels but they also can be varied in actual excecution (You don't have to do what you are asked or told to do in the order given). Plus you can upgrade and vary upgrade choices as you go which is made much easier once you establish the best way to make money quickly to make purchases.For 'Hints' and 'Bonus' material please refer to my guides section for this game to learn more. There is quite a deal of information there that will assist with gameplay and the acquisition of money required to purchase upgrades.In short 'Rage' is a great game that can be left alone for a while and comfortably returned to at a later date and played again and again. Great graphics, good story line and flexible playability. Extra DLC's would be great to expand this game as it lends itself to more missions.First time through took some 30 - 40 Hrs and this will vary depending on how much or how little you feel you want to do. The game is extremely flexible and I would rate it 9/10.I have uploaded many screenshots that will giva an indication of what to expect.Have fun.			"

IntroductionRage is smi-open world FPS game. The main reasons to get this game is the gunplay, level design,ai and enemy animations.GameplayThe gunplay in the game is really good because if you shoot an enemy leg he will start to crawl to behind cover while at the same time try to shoot you, if an enemy charges you and you shoot him in one side of their body they will spin and at the same time go foward due to their momentum and headshots are truly satisfying where the enemies heads just explode in a really statisfying way.You play as an ark soldier that has regenerating health and has an emergency defibrilator that creates an emp blast that stuns nearby enemies so it basically gives you a second chance but it has a fairly long cooldown. A good portion of the game you spent going into bandit's hideouts and kill them and sometimes collect some quest related items and in that department the game has a fairly large enemy variety. The second kind of enemies you fight are the mutants where the small common ones usually charging at you in wide angle so that way it is harder to shoot them instead of just going at you in a straight line, and then there is the large mutants that are kinda like mini bosses that are quite tough and deal a good amount of damage. And finally the last kind enemies that you face are high tech soldiers with plasma guns and shields.Besides that you also have races that give you tickets to improve your cars and change their appearance based on the upgrades that you get and also have a few diferent paintings to choose from.And finally you have a decent variety of minigames that fit the game theme and one of them is a card game where you play with the cards that you collect throughout the levels, so in that way the game collectables are actually used for something and if you miss one that is in an area that you cant acess anymore the game shops will sell you that card for 1k dollars which is quite alot but the minigames can give you a decent amount of money so it isnt so bad if you miss one or 2.StoryThe story is alright but it is good enough to fit the overall gameplay theme. The ending some people dont like it but in my opinion it kinda fits because the whole game you are just a lone wolf that deals with stuff that people ask you to do in exchange for armor, weapons, money and recipes that will help you make cool stuff. However if after the ending the game continued it would be just an all out war between 2 factions which would be pretty much a completely different game so in my opinion it ends where it is suposed to.ConclusionRage is a pretty good FPS that i strongly recomend to play at ultra nightmare dificulty which is the highest if you just want  to have a truly great FPS experience however the only issue that I have with that dificulty is that the time trials are bit bs because they literally ask you to make perfect run in the first and last time trials but out side of that it is a quite enjoyable experience.

Solid FPS with some nice Open-world and RPG elements.Don't expect too much from the story. Even though the whole post-apocalyptic universe this game is set in seems very authentic and well done, there could've been done so much more in order to make the story more compelling. There are a great amount of interesting characters, both enemies and allies, which add to the atmosphere.The gunplay overall is not on the level of Killing Floor 2 for example but above average nontheless. The guns handle well, the sounds are realistic and shooting feels satisfying. Different types of ammunition help spice things up especially later on in the game.Throughout the game, RAGE wants you to believe it's an open world shooter. Between quests, it does a relatively good job at it. During missions, however, there are a LOT of invisible walls which can get annoying at times. Most missions consist of going into a cave/dungeon/city/building and pick something up/deliver something etc. and then go back to the quest giver. The levels are generally linear but well designed. You don't have to run back the way you came which prevents the player from losing attention quickly. There are not a lot of areas that I felt like I want to get out of immediately.If you're planning on playing RAGE on hard difficulty, I wouldn't bother. All they did was turn the enemies into bullet sponges. It doesn't necessarily make the game harder, but you just end up wasting a lot more ammo and it just doesn't feel right to see a bandit without any heavy armor take a couple dozen bullets before eventually dying.Overall, I didn't feel like quitting the game at any point, the game kept me interested enough to play it for about 13 hours. If you're into games like Fallout or the Metro series this might just be something you should consider picking up.			"

												Borderlands meets Fallout without the charm of either.  I've been playing this for a few days now and I have to say it is interesting but a bit inconsistent.  The save from death system is a bit of a pain, and doesn't always work.  You get a chance to save yourself after being blow up by a rocket, but not falling from a not-so great height.  The lack of an auto-save is infuriating, or should I say, again, inconsistent.  There are checkpoints, not that it'll ever inform you that you've hit a checkpoint, and when you transition through a load screen you get an autosave but the missions are so long it's basically a useless auto-save.  The game is still worth playing if you can snag it on sale like I did, but in the current world of constant auto-saves just get used to having to save your game manually every 5-10 minutes or face the 90's world of starting over two hours ago.

												A post-apocalyptic setting, you know I love it. The plot is simplistic but ""effective"". There's nothing here that you haven't seen before but what is there is done well. This game came out years ago but at the time of this writing the movie Mad Max: Fury Road [2015] came out a month ago and the look of the movie is very reminiscent of this game, in a good way. Sometimes I drove around in my Cuprino just to listen to the purr of the engine.Whenever I think of this game I remember a specific moment: When I enter the Blue Line Station (an area about 2/3 through the game) during a mission I always come upon a single mutant who spawns in a non-agro state coming out of the bathroom. For some reason or another this lone mutant always spawns and never attacks me. He just comes out (hope he washed his hands) and slowly patrols the hallway. It throws me off everytime. Do I have to kill him? Should I? He's not threatening to me, not right now at least. Even if I block his path he doesn't attack, he just stops and looks at me until I step aside. This mindless shoot-em-up made me think about the morality of killing virtual creatures.			"

												I enjoyed the game. It's not AMAZING or anything but I enjoyed it. If you're getting this game, keep in mind that while the game might look like it's open world, the world is just a hub for different missions, which are mostly linear. The missions are still fun though. If that's fine by you, then go for it. People say the graphics are bad, but I think the graphics look good overall, if you look at things from a distance. It's just the closeup textures that are bad.Also be warned that the ending is absolutely garbage. But the game is still fun.			"

												Hmm...Is it enjoyable...yes.Could they have done more...defo.I've noted some other reviews voicing the same concern as me: story and depth. This game started very interested. Atmosphere of earlier missions quite engrossing, but as the game wears on atmosphere seems to decline as weapons improve and enemies stay predictable. The ending is unfortunately quite underwhelming. If you get a nice weapon towards the end of a campaign, you expect to be able to use it, right...well I think they may have missed the mark there. Overall however I can't say I didn't enjoy myself.

												This game is fun :DThe gameplay is good and feels complex enough to immerse you but not so complex as to slow down the action.The gun combat feels good to play and the kills are satisfying. The post-apocalyptic environment is immersive as well and looting enemies and their bases is fun.It's not perfect - the ""open world"" feels limited at times and the graphics can look a bit bland. Also the driving sections feel a bit tedious when you just want to get into the shooting action! But hey these things aren't a big deal.The co-op seems pretty cool as well. Poor matchmaking but the gameplay is good.So yeah, definitely recommended if you want a casual, immersive and satisfying shooter, but perhaps not ideal for those who want a lot of depth.			"

												Ultimately, I'm going to give this a recommendation...but only just! The game ""feels"" good to play, weapon sounds and effects make them feel like they have some punch rather than "" Tink tink ka tink"". Graphics are what you'd expect from an ID engine, not bad...though I wasn't overly impressed with the muddy looking textures. The storyline I felt was a little ho hum....which ended in a pile of steaming feces. The only saving grace for this game is the gameplay. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience ...right up untill the final 10 mins. Sorry, but think Borderlands.			"

												Perhaps it's a bit late to write a review, considering the game came out in 2011, but I decided to do it because of constant negativity surrounding the title. Let's take some common misconceptions out of the way from the get go: Rage is NOT an RPG game and it's NOT an ""open world"" game. Its design is mostly reminiscent of games such as ""Quake II"" or ""HeXen"", which used hub levels. In Rage, the wasteland is the hub level. Long story short - the game is an FPS full of action, as expected from id Software.What I really liked about the title is that despite features taken from modern shooters (iron sights, regenerating health) they don't really define the gameplay. You can switch off regeneration via the game console and iron sights aren't really needed - I beat the whole game using solely HUD cross hairs. If you REALLY want a challenge, I highly recommend id.dav81's fantastic ""Rebalance Mod"", it's hard though, you've been warned.The gunplay is excellent - weapons ""feel"" just right and enemies react to being shot accordingly to the wound's location. The graphics and music are also on a very high level - the atmosphere of post-apocalyptic wasteland and its danger is palpable.There is plenty of additional side-quests and mini-games to try, but their number is well balanced not to divert the player's attention from the game's focus - action. They help in building the atmosphere and immersing the player, that's all.The only downside is the ending of the game. It feels rushed and not thorougly thought through. However, at the time of this writing (September 2014) Rage is still the best single-player FPS game I have ever played. Great graphics, balance and, most importantly, gameplay. The ending didn't change my opinion, because in this game's case the journey truly is a reward in itself.I wholeheartedly recommend it to all fans of FPS games.			"

												I bought this game awhile ago and on sale, and didn't really get into it. The driving bugged me, and held me back from progressing in the game. Then I tried it again about a year later and really got into it. Once I realized that the races and the upgrades you buy with winning the races made driving a whole lot easier it became really fun, and addictive.  Also the Bandits you kill for the bar owners also give you racing certificates to buy upgrades for your vehicle which is good if you never get into the whole racing thing.In ways it started to remind me of Borderlands.  Although the story line is different obviously.Worth playing for the achievements, even in Ultra Nightmare difficulty the enemies are the same as the Easy difficulty.  However you take serious damage fast, which makes you step up your strategy.			"

												This game was...underwhelming, especially after hearing people compare it to Fallout. It feels like started out like a great game, but the developers got bored with it.  Rage plays alot like borderlands, but without the fun of co-op, building a skill tree through level progression, or finding better/interesting weapons.  -The vehicle combat in the game is pretty stagnant and just ends up feeling like a chore when driving from place to place.  +There's some content to explore outside the main story; a handful of sidequests/jobs and mini-games that might keep you busy for a little while, but have no real impact on the game.+The combat can be chaotic fun, the game offers a variety of ways to kill baddies.  There are a handful of interesting boss fights.  Some environments can be used to your advantage to surprise enemies with fire, electricity, spinning blades, etc.  There's no way that's really significantly better than the others at dispatching enemies, however it can be fun to use these things in combination.  My personal favorite toy in the game was the sentry bot.  The only disappointing part to combat was that it was too easy.  I played through the game on normal and NEVER used a healing item because your health regenerates quite quickly.  And if you do die, your character has a built in defibrillator that will instantly revive you (as well as killing surrounding enemies).  So I would highly recommend playing on a harder difficulty setting.-If you're looking for a good story, this is NOT the game for you.  Where the environments are interesting and varied; the story is very vague and un-engaging; it merely exists as a medium so the game can pit you against seemingly endless waves of enemies.  The ending of the game is by far the most disappointing aspect of the game. (Minor SPOILER ALERT:  there is no final boss, just a few waves of easy enemies.)  The game ends just as the story is getting started.  You have no real choices or impacts upon the world.  Your experience through the game will be the exact same as everyone else, which is why I'm not recommending the game.  I paid $5 for this game on a sale, and I wouldn't advise you to spend a penny more than that on it.			"

												Often described as ""Borderlands meets Fallout"", RAGE comes to us from the godfathers of the FPS: id. Due to a number of technical issues at launch, this game never got the credit I felt it deserved - the fundamentals are done really well, but there are some shortcomings as well: Guns sound and feel really solid - as you would expect from an FPS master like id. AI is decent as well - maybe a bit predictable, but their movement is fluid and natural. A well fleshed-out world, containing mini-games, crafting, a wide variety of locales, and more.BUT The ending is obviously a setup for a sequel - seems like this will never happen, thus it feels unsatisfying. The decision to make multiplayer racing only is strange from a company of id's calibre. Even today, optimisation is poor - I still get drops on a GTX 970.If you have issues, I recommend trying the below guide (all credit goes to OP):

												Rage is the last FPS developed by id software, the mother of the genre. Combining few RPG elements with free roam and vehicle races, the gameplay is somehow unique. The FPS mechanics are well crafted and gun feel is really good, while races and short travels only represent a break from linear levels, adding some poliedricity wich never results boring. Enemies movements will test your shooting skills, like few games do, and crafting system will need your creativity to choose the right strategy for every fight. Even if the abientation is immersive, the plot is however poor, expecially in the end, making Rage a good game but definitely not a masterpiece.85/100			"

												This game is like the kid who got straight 'A's in school, knew all the answers to every test, then went to university, smoked too much pot and dropped out in the second term. In other words, it's a disappointing under-achiever. It looks very pretty (even though it's getting on a bit), and it provides the illusion of some sort of open world, but that's all it is. An illusion. You're ultimately just shuffling from room to room and looking at what's going on. Of course, ""it's a corridor shooter by ID! That's the point!"" You might say, but it's even disappointing in that regard. You have too much health, there's too much ammo, the enemies are too stupid and there is basically no way to actually lose the game. I think I fell over about 3 times in total. And I mean ""fell over"" - I never actually died because you get a 2nd and 3rd chance through a ""defibrillator unit"" which wipes out enemies and revives you if you can manage to mash the E button at the sound prompt. And when I did fall over, it was because I couldn't be bothered using cover when I should have been. On top of the fact that you self-revive for no penalty, you get an endless supply of bandages that you can stuff down your throat to instantly restore your health. I used about 5 of those in the entire game, because it was just so easy. Of course, I was playing on normal, and I *could* have upped the difficulty (and I did for a while), but disappointment on top of disappointment, the higher difficultly levels just give the enemies more HP. This doesn't actually make the game difficult, it just makes every fight take longer and become not just easy but actively boring.I think the actual worst part, and what left me with a sour enough taste in my mouth to leave a review, was the storyline and the ending. The game is hurtling along, introducting all sorts of characters, many of whom are absolutely brilliantly realised and fantastically animated, and then it just stops. Suddenly you're on the end mission, you're handed a minigun and told to go activate a satillite uplink in the enemy base. You do so, get a 15 second cut scene and that's the end. There's no boss fight, no challenge (because you just mow everything down with afore mentioned minigun) and you don't even meet the big bad leader of the Authority (the badguys). Seriously, you hear his voice, once, and that's it. You never even see him. There's absolutely no sense of closure, no sense that you've finished up the story, nothing. It just stops dead and gives you the credits.I suppose I could also mention the races and vehicle combat. The races are ok. They're fun for about 30 minutes, but again way, way too easy and end up just a chore. This is compounded by the fact that the loading times are atrocious, so you spend almost as long waiting for the race to load as you do racing. Great. The vehicle combat exists. It's... there. That's about all you can say about it. If you want a corridor shooter, go play Wolfenstein: New World Order. It's slightly longer, has almost the same story line, but is way more entertaining, occassionally actually difficult and has Nazis to murder. What more could you want?If you've run out of everything else to play, and want to waste 7-10 hours clicking on bad guys, there are worse ways to spend your time than RAGE, but that's not exactly a recommendation, is it?

												id Software has written several pages of videogame history, creating the archetypal '90s shooter with Doom and bringing the third dimension to gaming with Quake. John Carmack and John Romero have created such legacy for themselves that their promises and opinions are to be taken seriously today, even after all the years that have passed since they went their separate ways. So when John Carmack lets it be known that he is about to deliver a shot heard round the world it is quite understandably taken as an accurate description of future events.RAGE is known to most gamers rather from the circumstances surrounding it than the actual game itself. To call the pre-release buzz a hype is a true understatement. Many believed the hype only to be disillusioned on release, with ""is this it?"" being the collective response. And as history has shown, the reaction was justified since RAGE came and went without impacting much of anything, let alone becoming legend. Now that the circumstances have changed a quiet appreciation has grown around the game as it it taken for what it is and not what it's creators meant it to be.The world has ended and the player character awakens to a wasteland, as is custom, and meets the people and the factions that have survived or emerged in the meanwhile. Unfortunately there is no imagination or surprise involved in any of this. There are The Raiders, The Authority (!) and The Resistance as well as The Mutants and finally the common folk. Everything is so generic and lifeless that the names in capital letters are also the only description required. Even more unsettling is listening to the NPCs talk. An abstract, Lydia-like cheer has descended on the survivors and not a single line of dialogue sounds like actual speech. A vendor says ""All my stuff is A-one premo"" in an attempt to simulate humanity with literally everything else being poorly disguised information about the game mechanics involved. Fortunately the protagonist is just as wordless as Gordon Freeman or the Doom Marine before him so there are no attempts at drama. The main story is so straightforward I am hesitant to call it a story and all the characters are merely their occupations. There are no themes introduced or points made. And although many many women dress extremely impractically to say the least there is absolutely no romance or sex anywhere, not even married couples among the NPCs. All the writing involved in RAGE is words, nothing more, and my mood always soured when I had to stop playing the game and listen to the people in it.What makes the world of RAGE even more unwelcoming are the excruciatingly slow and dull opening hours. There are so few places to go, weapons and tools to use and things to do that it takes some self-discipline to soldier on. This is undoubtedly where the synthetic if not downright artificial nature of the world shows its very worst. Fortunately the first day of gaming is misleading: as the world in which you can wander in gets bigger the game gets better as well. The farther away I proceeded from settled areas the more I enjoyed myself. The levels are highly linear but well-designed and even the typical ruins and bunkers are interesting to explore. I was most impressed by the ruins of a great city that felt like nothing had been spoken in them for decades. Exploring these streets was the equal of any other post-human gaming experience and conveyed more meaning than any amount of words could have done.While all the characters are just happy automatons they were at the least well-made automatons and much thought has clearly gone into them, despite well-known influences showing here and there. The animations were exemplary in many cases, especially those of the melee chargers found on many levels. Mutants charge forward in berserk parkour and should they get decapitated they keep running for a few more paces until realising that they have died not a moment before. The gameplay in RAGE is the traditional first person shooting seen many times before and since. It is made enjoyable by the large variety of weapons and quick-use items as well as the enemy behaviour. Only those equipped for close combat will charge forward, while those with firearms shoot from behind cover and finally retreat and regroup at the next defensive position with fresh troops coming in as well. Enemies will also get visibly injured and hobble around in pain or shoot from a sitting or lying position in their last moments. Doing this to the bad guys requires of course appropriate tools and RAGE delivers. There is a large arsenal and while it mostly consists of time-tested pistols, assault rifles and shotguns they universally look, sound and feel good in use. The basic ammunition types are nothing compared to the specialist ones you need to craft or buy at a high price. My personal favorite was the crossbow with four different types of bolts. One of these variants was a mind control crossbow bolt which lets an enemy to be walked to his comrades in remote control to be then exploded by a button press. This is one of the best But Of Course weapons in recent memory and there is undeniable glee in using it. The craftable quick-use items are even better and I was able to use most of them at a constant rate which is to say I appreciated the system very much. The first one accessed is the Wingstick, a throwable weapon looking something like a cross between ceiling fan and huge shuriken. It has limited guidance in flight and will return to the source to be used again later. Decapitating a charging mutant with one and retrieving the implement gave me a self-esteem boost against my better judgement.Controls felt natural and all the menu systems were ideally clear and informative. It is most unfortunate how blurred things can look on close inspection, especially the clutter items. RAGE looks great in motion, however, and my game was a stable one as well. There is a command console and mod support for the technologically skilled. I used a keybind to hide my HUD and weapon to take screens as my only modification. A full third of my 300+ screens are from my RAGE playthrough which is certainly a testament to my gaming experience as a statistic alone.RAGE has one major DLC, The Scorchers, which merits a separate mention. It plays to the strenghts of the base game, with spectacular level design and highly intense gunfights. The story is kept to the bare minimum, thankfully, and the missions are well integrated on the main campaign. The weapon added is also one of the very best available, useful but well-balanced and with three distinct forms. The titular Scorchers also feature some of the most amusing battle chatter available and must be quoted here. Melee berserkers tell you that they love you during their charge and shooters remind themselves of their ""Happy place!"" when wounded. Should a comrade fall the survivors exclaim in sorrow ""We lost what's-his-name!"" and remark how the player needs more therapy. All in all The Scorchers is a highly polished addition to RAGE, equaling the finer levels in the base game and even surpassing them in places.RAGE is one of those games that feel better out of context. It did not change the course of game design and will not give gamers reason to reinterpret the enjoyable hobby in question. But it is beyond any doubt a well-made shooter experience, carrying on certain traditions and expanding on others, all the while being an imaginary world well worth the visit if only for the places alone.

												So the game is good, one of my favourites. It's pretty much a shooter with some very basic RPG elements like crafting and items, not to say this is an RPG in any way though. There is also Mad max style cars with some pretty fun vehicular combat. So the gameplay is fun, but what really does it for me in this game is the setting and environment. Its like the mad max post-apocalyptic wasteland but there are these super high-tech sci-fi ♥♥♥ overlord rulers and its pretty dope. However the game isn't perfect and the vehicle bits get pretty repetitive and the story isn't that interesting, also the ending is complete wank.Overall I recommend it as I'm a sucker for post-apocalyptic and sci-fi worlds and this has it both.

And who doesn't love throwing a three bladed boomerang at people that cuts their heads off? This game is like Mad Max meets Fallout but it is not copying either and is a genuine game with ACTUAL creativity and art design that I respect a lot considering that most of the games out now are the exact same thing.Playing this game again brought back my memories as a child of having an amazing time and constantly smiling while playing and it gave me the feeling of actually being in a apocalyptic wasteland. Sure, the maps are a little linear but who says that this game is bad because of that? It looks like they had to animate each map with extra care and time so I don't complain, because I could never make something as pretty as the maps in this.id software and Bethesda game studios created an incredible game.

												RAGE sets you in a ravaged wasteland world that is home to mutants, bandits and the Authority which all want a piece of you or should I say, a nice chunk of you. The wasteland environment looks gorgeous both in the way it has been designed and the graphics itself which easily helps with emersion. There are perhaps a few iffy textures when it comes to some of the interior levels, but if you can look past that and enjoy the wasteland, it's easily cancelled out. The character models and weaponary also look fantastic.Apart from the main story, the game offers some decent side missions, events and numerous amounts of things to collect. Schematics, recipies (these allow you to craft various things as long as you have parts), collectables, mini games, stunt jumps throughout the wasteland and of course, racing events where you can earn racing certificates to be used in upgrading your vehicles. There are also various ammo types you can use with your weapons.There's a few co-op missions you can do with one friend or a random. They're fun, but unfortunately a little short. There's also multiplayer by way of racing, but as to be expected, the multiplayer portion has fizzled out. The ending could be viewed as somewhat disappointing in the fact that it's left rather open and perhaps there could have been some stronger emphasis on the story, but all small negatives considered, the gameplay is solid, the graphics fantastic and there's plenty to keep you busy with for quite some hours. Having played three playthroughs of RAGE on Normal, Nightmare and Ultra Nightmare, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed the game each time.			"

												RAGE is a first person shooter (FPS) with gorgeous graphics in a semi-open world game where there are numerous side quests, racing, and collectibles to accompany the main story line. Covering everything in the game should take a little more than 20 hours giving the game great value. Aside from your typical FPS game there are some RPG elements in this game where you have an inventory to craft some unique items and to collect misc. items just to sell them. The weapons are varied with multiple types of ammo which differentiate the weapons even more. Overall, this game puts the player through a fun filled adventure with amazing graphics and awesome gunfights!			"

												The Scorchers DLC opens up a new series of missions that start in the Northern Wasteland, inside Hagar Territory, where you headed first in the original game. Don’t worry, if you’ve already finished the main story in Rage, this DLC also brings in a new feature that allows you to continue to explore the Wasteland after you’ve completed the main campaign.When you load up your game you’ll be given a mission that asks you to investigate a new gang of bandits called The Scorchers. As you investigate this new threat you’ll meet up with new allies, gain access to new weapons and visit new locations. The great thing about The Scorchers is that the missions integrate into the main game, and the new areas all branch off existing areas in the game. You’ll still be able to visit the same shops, and talk to the same people, in between each part of the Scorchers mission....Nailgun is coming...			"

												Oh Rage. You could, and should have been so much more.. First of all: the gun play in Rage is rock solid. ID knows how to make shooting fools in the face satisfying. But, and there is a huge but; the story is so badly put togheter and full of plot holes that by the end of the game i was really scratching my head at the fact that this was put togheter by a professional writer. The main plot really feels like it was cut short and the few subplots is just dead ends and is hardly worth you`re time. Then there is the mini games.. Personally i rarely engage in mini games unless there is some kind of story exposition to be had. Rage has so many pointless mini games that gives you absolutely nothing. They really feel like some slapped on filling since the ""side quest"" part of the game is a joke.The game also suffers greatly from constant ""pop-in"" that can be really annoying if you are sensitive to that kind of graphical glitches.All in all i was very disapointed.

												Rage is a fantastic game with an interesting story line, the intro towards the game is brilliant and makes the game moving and interesting to play on to find what happens. The game does have bad points but also bring good points, my bad points towards the game is, it’s too short, you will spend around 8 hours on the game and you’ll complete it, if you do the side quests and try for 100% completion, it may take up to 15 hours. When you get into your first town area, it’s hard to find your way around the area and can take up time, me personally I don’t want to get lost and waste time trying to find a place where I need to be. However in the towns, you have a lot of stuff to do, such as go to the merchants and buy ammo, items for building items and also you can play mini games to earn extra money in the game. They is also a race events that you can attend to which gives something extra to do in the game and something to complete.The ending of the game seems dull and could have been better and could tell more information on what happened.The graphics towards the game is amazing with a lot of details towards the scenes with shooting and driving around in the care.The mechanics of the game for me personally were hard to get used, but eventually I got used to them, they even easier with a controller. Driving is fluid, walking is fluid and both seem realistic.The game reminds me of Borderlands and a slight hint of Fallout, with rage having it’s own elements towards the game.I am happy with buying this product and would recommend this to anyone who enjoys shooters with a different atmosphere.

												The game is pretty fun. The shooting is awesome, the variety in weapons is neat, and the enemies are apocalyptically crazy! For whatever reason, I had the profound thought when I first started this game that the shooting just felt really good. It felt comfortable and just great in general, beyond what other games have done.The driving works well enough, and blowing up enemy cars is always awesome, but there's just a little something missing that keeps it from being great. It was neat to get to use my apocalyptic car to race others, it was a good change of pace sometimes from blasting psychos and mutants. I enjoyed that I could customize my car up a bit, adding upgrades and changing out weapons and such.The world is kind of open, but not in the way The Elder Scrolls or Fallout or Far Cry are, it feels much more linear than that. The places where you can drive feel open but like there are only certain paths to take. Each area you explore on foot has some room for a little side exploration to discover hidden stuff, but it doesn't have the same sense of adventuring as other games do. You can do whatever you want, but there isn't much more to do than shoot up your enemies. To make up for what I'm going to say next a bit, the game does have a unique storyline, interesting characters, and the graphics are really beautiful. It was interesting listening to the voices of all the variety of characters, they had neat dialogue and were voiced well. Unfortunately, even though the characters were neat, the game just couldn't make you care less about what was going on, why you were doing what you were doing, or make you want to care about any of the characters. The storyline is unique, but it wasn't done well enough that it gripped you.Overall, it's a fun game and definitely worth your time, but there is definitely potential for so much more. I'd love to see another game in this franchise.			"

												Graphics and the general ""mechanics"" of the game were good, but there just seemed to be something lacking throughout. The story felt like a very weak attempt at blending elements of other post-apocalyptic worlds where everyone decides to go back to gang culture. Not one of the characters felt real. The racing and shooting were great, but with completely flat and unengaging characters and a bland storyline, I never really felt any real incentive to go on (aside from that intrinsic need to finish games just for the hell of it).To top off a vanilla storyline, some parts of the game (dialogue and cutscenes) were just a grind and involved furiously tapping various keys to try and skip poor dialogue from characters speaking ridiculously slowly.To be honest, I feel like the game was a lacklustre FPS version of Fallout plus a bit of Borderlands, but with only a fraction of the fun factor.

												I liked this game. It gets a lot of flak for not being a ""landmark"" title like people seem to expect from id, but that doesn't automatically mean it's terrible. But it's not fantastic. [Note: I did not play the co-op or multiplayer modes]The world is one of the more interesting post-apocalyptic settings I've seen in a video game, with obvious inspiration from Mad Max but with its own twist on the setting. The characters aren't really anything special, just basic NPCs that tell you where to go and what to do, then inexplicably disappear. Despite the cardboard characters, the world itself feels very lived in and real. The various throw-away NPCs scattered throughout towns comment on the events of the game as they unfold, they walk and move around so they don't just stand in one place for weeks on end like many other games, and some even move to new locations entirely.The plot and story start out simple and strong. It's nothing amazing, but it's done well enough that it works. The entire first half of the game is spent doing odd jobs for the various citizens of the wastelands (mostly killing ♥♥♥♥). Turns out, that's just a way of gaining notoriety so they can explain the terrible second half of the game. Roughly half of the way through the game, the game thrusts you into an anti-authoritarian resistance movement that has literally zero connection to the previous arc, with very little buildup to this sudden switch. You go from a wasteland survivor to ragtag rebel toppling a technologically superpower (that's never been done before!). What really blasts the story's coffin into the dirt is the ending: there basically isn't one. You go to a building, press some buttons, and there's a cutscene. Literally no issues brought up throughout the game are resolved. Literally none. You do not win. You do not lose. The ending is totally irrelevant to the overall story.Mechanically speaking, the gameplay is solid. The combat in general is really fun and just feels nice. I did feel as if certain weapons (the assault rifle, pistol with normal ammunition, the DLC nailgun's default mode) were totally useless once you get alternate ammunition or different guns, but they still served a purpose in the long run. What really surprised me is the variation in enemies. There's really only ""two"" enemies in the game: mutants and humans. But each faction of the humans has its own unique look and sound and combat style, which makes combat with different factions feel very refreshing despite the enemies more or less having the same set-up. I personally wasn't a huge fan of the vehicle combat, personally. Late in the game, the opposing vehicular forces mostly just spam missiles and shields and it's just exhausting to fight them. That being said, the vehicles themselves felt very nice and responsive - even with mouse and keyboard.tl;dr It's a really solid and fun game. Don't go into it expecting a masterpiece and you'll probably be impressed. It's not a bad game, and it's definitely above average in terms of quality and quantity of content. Very much worth its current price, and most definitely worth it at a discount. Anyone who disagrees is a bad person!! "

												well... I bought this game expecting a fallout-esque post apocalyptic adventure game from reading the reviews, and what I got was more along the lines of a modern DOOM with the look and feel of fallout, with the dungeon design of Oblivion/Skyrim.and what do I mean by that... well: The game is set in a post apocalyptic wasteland after an asteroid has struck earth, there are people buried in things called ""Arks"" much like the vaults in fallout. The guns, landscape, and enemies you face scream fallout.so the gameplay: Not fallout at all... I almost feel like the ability to aim down the sights of your gun is out of place in this game. It is extremely fast paced, I equate it to DOOM or another oldie FPS because I spent a good 90% of the game running around with a shotgun and my boomarang knives rather than hiding behind cover waiting for a headshot, and I am perfectly fine with that. I can't really describe the rush of throwing a wingstick at an enemy for the first time to have it take off their head and come back to you perfectly, It did not get old.and the level design: I really enjoyed the level design and it reminded me first and foremost of Oblivion style dungeons. That is to say that they were very straight-forward and hard to get lost in and wrapped around themselves wonderfully so that there was no backtracking to get back out. One thing you might frown upon is that you get sent into the same dungeons multiple times, even if they do send you through different paths and give you different enemies to kill, it seemed a bit lazy on some of the levels, but was executed perfectly on the Dead City level. The overworld is boring, The car segments boring - but take this with a grain of salt because I hate pretty much all racing games except MarioKart This game gets a thumbs up at it's discounted price which I got it with the DLC for 6,24$  I really wouldn't recommend it for any more than 15$ because it is only about 10-15 hours of good gameplay, unless you love twisted-metal-ey racing			"

												ID Software, For all we've been through, DooM, DooM 2, Doom 3... The graphics is beautiful and flourish, best performance I ever have seen compared with graphics. But the game is pretty easy And since it's the creators of doom, I had expected some more bosses, You have big guns, but you can actually complete the game with only pistol and the machine gun.4/10			"

												Started game, instantly ran into a brick wall of issues.There's a 64-bit option, helpfully listed as ""unsupported""- probably because it doesn't work, all I've heard from others is the same as what I got- black screen after the (unskippable) intro movie.The 32-bit version, meanwhile, has no mouse. Which you'll only notice when the (unskippable) intro movie ends and the game asks you to look up. How does an FPS manage to ♥♥♥♥ up mouse support that badly?			"

												RAGE:RAGE is a game in a post - apocalyptic world, or if you rather, the Wasteland.This is a game that includes looting (Ammunition, collectives and such) and a big arsenal of weapons that allows you to choose how to kill your enemys in serval different ways. One more cool thing this game have, is CARS, YES! On the campaign you get cars that you can ride in them trough the Wasteland and use them to crash\shot\explode your enemys, or just use them for racing and such.Beside the main missions, which are awesome by the way.... There are also alot of cool side missions that can either give you money or either grow your arsenal if you complete them. The gameplay is so fun, I have to say. Its very smooth and easy to control. And now about the soundtrack, its also OK... They really fitted in the music to the location and the environment you're playing on, the characters, the weapons and the cars soundtrack.. This game is really fun and its awesome!!Highly recommended!			"

												This is one of the best games I have played. It is a very long game set in large levels. It is quite the challenge to play through in its hardest mode, even with the save anywhere feature. It also has a small racing element to it, but it can be avoided if you choose. You are given ridiculous advantages in the few races you are required to complete to progress the main first person shooter story.The art in this game is amazing you will not see the same thing repeated in the whole game, and the diversity of the enemies is immense. There are some graphics glitches with the texturing, but if antialiasing is turned off they are greatly reduced, and if you feel up to it there are numerous console settings that can make this game look ten times better.

												Outside of actual graphics, it is not too great. Although the world is open, the missions make it linear in nature. This is not too scary either, no dark places, so the previous spirit of games like Doom and Quake are lost. The main strength is the graphics, beyond that, it does not really take off or do anything particularly well. The vehicles add some fun but makes the game come off as a jack of all trades. I will likely play it out but lost interest after playing it a couple times and put it down. Not what I had expected for an ID game.			"

												Thanks to Steam's free-to-play weekend I gave RAGE a jam, what first drew me to download and play it was Snoop Dogg, RAGE is Snoops favourite game.I was a little reluctant at first because as a gamer I can become easily addicted to chasing achievements and didn’t want to delve into yet another post apocalyptic FPS, but RAGE is seeming more like a diamond in the rough.RAGE is a FPS developed by id Software. It uses the company's OpenGL-based id Tech 5 game engine and was released in October 2011.The game is set in a post-apocalyptic near future, following the impact of the asteroid 99942 Apophis on Earth. The game has been described as similar to the movie Mad Max 2 and to video games such as  Borderlands.The mixture of FPS shoot and loot based missions and demolition derby type racing is just enough to be entertaining, if you get board of the same go to point [A] and kill random bandits to recover some junk missions you can enter a race, zoom round a circuit and bash and crash your way across the finish line to earn more upgrades.In RAGE's story, the asteroid 99942 Apophis impacts the Earth on August 23, 2029, leaving few survivors. Human survivors have come together to form settlements around oases and other practical or habitable locations, including race tracks. These fragile homes are diligently defended by the inhabitants against bandits and mutants, which are divided into various gangs and organizations of their own.RAGE has two multiplayer modes: ""Road Rage"" and ""Wasteland Legends"". In Road Rage, up to four players compete in a free-for-all match that takes place in an arena designed to make use of the vehicles. The objective is to collect rally points that appear around the arena while killing your opponents and stealing their points. Legends of the Wasteland is a series of two-player co-op missions based on stories that are heard throughout the single-player campaign.So aside from the basic gameplay and plot overview my personal opinion on rage is to give it a go, even just a few casual missions and there are fun or get right into the game and get all those delicious achievements.If you find yourself really getting into the RAGE universe, Bethesda and Dark Horse Comics announced a three-issue comic book series based on RAGE, also there is an entire novel based on RAGE game.Enjoy killing bandits and making the roads a safer place, but watch out for Mutant's...

												This game have all the necessary potentials it needs to become a perfect game, but it fails to make a final touch to it.RAGE is an open-world, rogue-like fighting game similar to BORDERLAND but with quality graphic. The game concept and art is well made, and the progression of the storyline is indeed very unique and interesting.But what could have been a perfect game falls short when the plot of the game suddenly came to a sudden end that leaves all loose end... well, loose! It is a very anticlimactic, and it just leaves me blank when the game suddenly rolled to the ending credit.As I mentioned before, this game already have all the necessary components ready, but failed to utilize the ultimate ending that would make this game into a perfect piece.The gameplay time is significantly short.Nevertheless, this is still a great game to play, and very enjoyable while it last until the plot ended.I would rated it 8/10, where the -2 is deducted from the loose end plot			"

												Just a bit miffed, I’d sayThere’s a great game in here somewhere, struggling to get out. Unfortunately it never quite succeeds. RAGE was hyped up enormously prior to its launch and I was one of those gamers who looked forward to getting around to playing it. Don’t get me wrong,  I enjoyed the game but I was always aware that it could have been so much better. The story is standard post-apocalyptic fare and, more notably, the script lacks humour. The gameplay and combat, while good at times, are never outstanding. It tries to create the illusion of open-world play but in fact it’s pretty much a corridor shooter with defined routes and little opportunity to explore. The graphics are also deceptive: the landscapes look good from a distance but close-up the textures are disappointing. It should be noted, however, that the background music is quite impressive. There are echoes of both Borderlands and Fallout 3 here, but RAGE is a subpar game when compared to either. It’s a shame that the people who brought us the excellent Doom series failed, on this occasion, to match their earlier success. I’ve no doubt, however, that they will regain their form in the future.3.5/5			"

												RAGE is a great game. many say its bad because of the ending which the ending leaves you kinda on a cliff hanger. but the overall gameplay is amazing and all the different varieties of enemies is very fun and keeps you on edge. the racing just add more fun while you get to blow cars up and take first place to upgrade your car. if you like racing and blowing things up.. first person shooter with awesome guns and cool upgrades.. oh and you get to beat the authorities ♥♥♥ which is fun too.. your character makes them look like a ant beneath your boot. anyways this game is very interesting and the story is nice too.. i highly recommend this game. 20/10			"

												This game amazing, yes it got it's fair share of problems like texture popins (You can fix most of the texture popins)or framerate problems especially if you're using an amd processor like me. But everything else than?The story, characters, enemies, the world itself. All of these are good things in the game. Let's start with the story, what about it? It's quite interesting even do you're like a errand boy from the past. Characters, they are cool and you will remember them after you have finished the game. Enemies are cool and interesting, some lack design like some of the tribes but the mutants don't get me started on them, they are the coolest thing ever. The design is so ♥♥♥♥ing good and cool. Every mutant look a bit different.The world than, how's it?  I can tell you that I have never thought that a wasteland was cool, but after playing this game. My opinion is completly different, I'm a #1 fan of wastelands now. I even prefer wastelands over the post-apocalyptic zone that we faces in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R serie.

												It isn't a bad game perhaps I was expecting much!!I have played through the whole game in 28.7 hours, completed each and every side quests (left a few), but after 28.7 hours of my life that I devoted to this game in hope of getting something, i was left with an empty stomache and with a bad taste in my mouth. Rage is a fully open world game, which involves sweet elements like the old school arcade type racing & fast paced combat. At first when I started, the opening sequence blew me away, the graphics looked sharp, art design and every graphical fidelity was top notch. I could see vast landscapes, people, bandits running around in their buggeys and all sort of ♥♥♥♥ and It made me super hyped up that I want to explore every bit of it. However that soon came to an end.ProsThe game looks stunning considering the fact that it came out 4 years ago. It does an awesome job of introducing new combat mechanics and enemy types. This isn't just an open world fps game, it also involves old school arcade style racing, something that reminded me of some of the classics I palyed back when I was small. This game might not have tonnes of guns but holy ♥♥♥♥!! it has tonnes of different bullets!! (Yup! you heard me......Bullets!!). Each enemy type requires you to switch ammunition type. Heavy bullets for heavily armored, insanely heavy bullets for insanely armored. This requires you to plan ahead before infiltrating a bandit camp, stocking up on ammo, best suited for that faction and resources. The game has a good variety and amount of enemy types that it will throw at you to keep things interesting. Weapons are awesome and every enemy reacts differently to different weapon, shoot their legs and they'll stumble and fall or shoot their faces and they'll try to reassure that their face isn't missing by touching it with their hands. The enemy ai is good, really good.The game also has a decent crafting system which let's you craft items on the fly. You usewhatever parts scrap metal, junk you can salvage from the wasteland and dead bandits to create turrets, medkits, lock grinders, RC bbombs etc.THE MULTIPLAYERSince I am playing the game 4 years after it's release, I couldn't find any matches online, Sorry!! ConsRage creates an illusion of being an open world I say this because at first it will tempt you by showcasing these sewers that are scattered all around the wasteland, the bandits carrying on with their work, doing their business but then it hits the speed breaker. When you finally get to explore these things you realize that their aren't that many sewers in the whole god damn game, and one of them unlocks only for one mission. The game will have you infiltrating the same camps again and again and again and again........ and for some f***ing reason you encounter enemies exactly at the same location you encountered them before, so even before you can see them you can fire a rocket straight to the location you had your last encounter and it will work. The world is big and filled with detail but there is not much to it, it all ultimately feels so dull because it lacks the depth feels too much abandoned, there's not a whole lot of things to do in it and it always holds your hand, restricting you from exploring it. Some of the locations which look interesting are locked out even though you could see the enemies shooting at you from a distance. I mean to say why give the players access to a place, which isn't ready to be discovered for another 2 to 3 hrs, so early. The sidequest are probably the weakest part of the game, the game itself is like stuck on a replay button, you do things which you have already done over and over again until you say ""f*** this....I'm out"". The end mission also feels a ♥♥♥♥♥slap to the players face, because the ending does not liveup to the hype that was earlier built throughout the campaign, the excitement to see the fate of the world, the future of your protagonist, what happend to your buddies etc, it's just so out of place and will leave you scratching your head. The NPCs look interesting (but are not) and have fluid animations but they don't have much to contribute towards your immersion and the world itself. This makes me feel so bad, this game feels like a wasted opportunity at the least, it certainly had tonnes of potentiol to become the next fallout people were hoping for.<SPOILER WARNING>   and don't even let me remind you how pathetic and cheap the end mission is, when you are finally ready to rumble in rages final round, you hear your companions warn you, saying things like, ""no one knows whats in there"" or things like ""whatever they are hiding in that facility must be big"" hearing all this got me pumped up, and since they gave me a big f***ing gun to handle with the mess, I started to believe that an epic boss battle awaited me. I stocked up on all my resources, built every sentry turret I could afford and then the big moment came but guess what!! you get to fight chimpanzees, yup! you heard me mother f***ers!! you fight chimps (mutated ofcourse, if that was the plot twist you were looking for)......""they litterally give you a futuristic big f***ing plasma gun to kill chimps"", WTF! VERDICT 7.8/10Sorry! but I just can't give it an 8, even though 7.8 pretty much means the same, In the end, I would just say go ahead and buy it. It is a fun shooter, which will really hook you to it self, as combat is certainly the one part of the game, where Rage shines. Just don' t expect much given that it is an open world game published by none other than ""Bethesda"".			"

												Story: Now a massive asteroid hits earth in the year of 2029. There is several areas that have pockets of survivors that are forced to begin a new civilization. The world is populated by human survivors of the impact, who have come together to form settlements around oases and other practical or habitable locations, including racetracks. These fragile homes are diligently defended by the inhabitants against bandits and mutants, which are divided into various gangs and organizations of their own. Now you the ark survivor comes into the world in the year 2135. Now this game gave me the feel of Fallout which I liked very much. Now people may say fallout rip off. Which I admit ok. But really its not exactly the same. It might start nearly the same but its just a different game. Any way. You fight your way through three area's to help bring the world back from the brink of its near destruction from the Asteroid. I liked this. A nice fit for survival.Game Play: The game primarily consists of FPS and driving area's, with the you using vehicle's to explore the world and travel between missions. Combat is in first person view. You are armed with a variety of firearms from pistols to a nice rocket launcher and my favorite weapon wing sticks (They are like boomerangs). You get different ammo for each weapon. Which you can change to your style. There is two types of enemies Shooting and melee, no need to explain what they do since its easy to figure out. Now there is several vehicle events for you to participate in. Races and checkpoint rallies. Racing events may or may not have opponents, and some of them are armed races while others are not. You have the ability to augment you cars with various items and upgrades you can gain by completing events. Rage also some (RPG) elements, inventory system, looting system and Also able to build a wide assortment of items using collected recipes. There are also side missions and a number of other minor exploratory elements to the game.Now this game is not fully open world like many out there. Yes you are restricted. But there is still a lot you can do. So do not let the closed world put you off. The game is fun and an interesting story to it to.Controls: Easy and simple for anyone to use. Not much else to say on that. Controls can be customized to how you like it of course via keyboard and mouse. The Graphics: The Graphics are really great. The characters and weapons had me drolling. Never seen such good graphics on my system like that and I am not usually some one for graphics.Music: It was good for the game. But for this game I turned it off so I could pay more attention to the game, sometimes I find music distracting in games.Bugs and Glitches: Right this was a big issue. Poor pc compatibility with this port. Rendering issues on the graphics and glitches in the sound along with (CTD's) But with user tweaks and fixes the game got better there was still issues but not as many for me it was just CTD's caused by my xfire. Technical issues with the PC version has led to articles explaining to users how to ""fix"" Rage's problems. AMD had released drivers that attempt to fix some the issues. Then on October 10, 2011 patches for the Windows version were released which added various graphical options to the game and fixed a number of driver-related graphical issues.Reply Value: Sadly I do not find any reply value in this game at all. Its a one time play in my books.Overall: Now the story is good in my books. Game play is good to but there is room for improvements. Controls are easy as I have said. Graphics are amazing. Music is good. Graphics really great. There is bugs and glitches in the game and most are fixed via user help and drivers and a patch. Even for a poorly ported game. This was quiet fun and exciting for me. The ending was nice to shows for a possible squeal. But I am not going to tell you the ending. So my rating for this game will be 7 paws for this good game.

												I just love post-apocalyptic games. This one is in particular one very atmospheric one. In the world of RAGE everything is just about your ""clan"" and racing. Though I am not really a racing gamer, the racing parts in this were kinda fun. You got different cars, to equip and to arm. Then you take it to the road. I just finished all the racing events in Wellspring the night I started. Although the ""Rocket Rally"" competitions are really getting on my nerves...The other part of the game is about the dangers of the wasteland, especially bandits and mutants. There are some small civilized groups and there are several bandit clans, which each got their own tone. Some are cannibal like, some are in control of the power plant and raise high prices for the energy. It just all really fits well together. The two main things that bothered me was the main story, which at first is nice and you get to love the characters, but later in the game is a little too ""rushed"". The later the game, the faster everything is done.  The other thing was a complete lack of decisionmaking you get to do. You are more of a mindless robot than a symbol for humanities best. All in all a solid game with good atmosphere and characters, that will not get too repetitive.			"

												RAGE is one of the first open world games i've actually enjoyed, while all the others mainly consist of travelling miles to an area then killing a few enemies, RAGE keeps travelling to a minimum and puts most emphasis into its amazing combat. Every shot feels powerful, as every bullet sends your target stumbling and limping. The first person combat sections are usually set in corridored levels full of enemies to mow down, making it a blend of Borderlands 2 (the driving, setting and open world) and Quake 4 (the frantic action set in the fairly common linear area). I recommend this to anybody who likes FPS and open world games.			"

												Rage is a mixed bag. There were times, when I was thinking ""Wow, this is one of my favourite games"", and then there were times, when I was cursing the devs for lack of balance (or my lack of gaming skills – depends on your perspective). But I definitely would recommend this game as a great example of FPS.Features:- Great setting that really provides a genuine sense of a post-apocalyptic world.- Decent amount of weapons with different kinds of ammo (a pistol, an assault rifle, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, a crossbow, a nail gun, a rocket launcher, a machine gun, a pulse cannon).- Crafting options that improve your statistics and arsenal (health upgrades, armor upgrades, wingsticks, bandages, turrets, sentry bots, bomb cars, EMP grenades, lock grinders, mind control bolts (!), health boosts, damage boosts etc.)- Four types of vehicles: a quadricycle, a buggy, a pick-up truck and an armored vehicle. The latter three are upgradable and eventually have three types of guns (a mini-gun that shoots bullets, a rocket launcher and a pulse cannon).- Three types of character customisation. Not that it matters much.- Fun side-missions- Mini-games (a card game, a knife game, wingstick throwing, roulette, poker, a kind of board game and banjo play). I basically played only the card game, the others were too boring.- Racing challenges where you can earn racing certificates required for vehicle upgrades- Interesting characters and enemies. There are basically three kinds of enemies: bandits (Vasted Clan, Shrouded Clan, Jackals, Ghost Clan, Gearheads, Scorchers), mutants and the Authority. Each of them require different approach.- Easter eggs and hidden arenas with references to previous iD releases (Doom and Wolfenstein). See the guides and YouTube for more info.- Sexy girls with funny monologue lines- A trophy room- Collectible cards (hard to obtain, but you have no other choice if you want to win the card mini-game). There are two achievements for that: one for collecting all cards and one for beating the most difficult deck.- Multiplayer and co-op. They're basically dead. Couldn't connect with my friend to play the Co-Op missions- An option to change difficulty during the gameplay.PROS:- Great, vivid graphics, but, as far as I've heard, they're better on consoles. Though, this is true only for landscapes, because the close-ups are lacking detail (e.g., blurred text, simplified texture).- Tactical gameplay. It's not just straightforward shooting. Your weapon and ammunition choice really matters, you need to use different approaches for different enemies. You can rush forward and take your chances with fast and strong weapons or take your enemies out one by one from cover or you can throw grenades and set back or you can take their heads off with wingsticks or a shotgun or you can stealth-attack with arrows and wingsticks - the choice is yours. You can even use turrets and bomb cars or mind-control enemies turning them into suicide bombers.- Interesting (though a simple) storyline with gradual and smooth progression but and abrupt ending.CONS:- Too much focus on racing for my taste. Also, some of the rally point missions and the third mail delivery mission are too difficult in my opinion. I managed to complete all of them, but seeing, how AI drivers steal rally points right under your nose half the time, was a bit frustrating at times. - Everything is expensive. You're constantly out of ammo or out of money. I had the same problem with Wolfenstein: NWO. I guess it's a kind of iD/Bethesda thing.- Some of the missions are too challenging. Challenge is a challenge, but when chordes of armored mutants are rushing towards you and you don't have time to properly aim and you require a whole magazine per enemy, it's no fun at all.- Video tearing on camera turns. You either need to lower your video settings or try manual configuration (see the guides for more info).- An abrupt ending of the storyline. Leaves a feeling that game was not fully completed.Nevertheless, I think that iD is a great developer and all their games are great, with RAGE being no exception.My overall rating: 9/10. And, yes, the DLC is worth the money.			"

												RAGE is an FPS made by the legendary ID software, responsible for Doom and Quake. This is their latest game, and while people say it's awful, it's only because ID made it, and the expectations were unreasonably high. This game feels like a watered down Borderlands, with the exploring and shooting fun. Not too much stuff to do, but the game is at a short, good length. I would say 10-15 hours should take care of it.The game plays like an ordinary FPS, running through places, shooting things. the game takes place in two separate hub locations, which branch off into different areas. The shooting is great, but the exploration is lacking. There really isn't much stuff to look at, making any collectibles and stuff pointless. The base game is quite enjoyable. It's just a normal shooter in a semi open world, don't expect anything more. There is a lot of racing sequences and driving, so be prepared to do some races and car combat if you want to get anywhere in this game.The multiplayer.....uhh.. The co-op missions are quite fun, but there's only a few of them to do. The road rage multiplayer is passable, and it's basically a ripoff of Twisted Metal.This game is beautiful, but suffers pop-in textures. Luckily, no matter how good your computer is, it should run very well. I have a terrible computer and I was able to run it in 60 FPS. This game is excellent, but don't set your expectations too high, because RAGE can only jump so high.			"

												An underrated game that's ahead of its time. I bought it when it came out, and then dropped it for something else new at the time. Decided to revisit this game after watching the Mad Max movie that recently came out. This game captures that kind of feel, with the wasteland style world, guns, bandits, cars, etc. One of the few games out there with this style!			"

												I remember hearing and waiting for this game back in '08. I actually remember them announcing that Rage would be coming out sometime in April, 2009. Yeah, that's how long I've been waiting for this game. Long and behold, it's finally here.For those who didn't know, this game occupies 3 DVDs. That's right, the game weights 21 GB. Well, at least Sony's Blu-Ray format doesn't have that problem. I am also extremely glad that the developers didn't trim down the game so it could fit on one DVD (you know, if it can fit on one DVD for the Xbox, then it can fit anywhere, kind of like what happened with the trimming down of the GTA 4 world map because of the DVD format.)Anyways, the new engine is astounding. The textures are amazing, especially the faraway ones. I get a stable 60 FPS with my Fermi, 8 GB Ram and 2.93 icore. It is very nice to see a new engine and not some re-used or re-updated albeit old inherently engine like Unreal 3.0.However, do not expect this game to be open-worlded in the same sense that Fallout 3 and New Vegas are. The world seems large but you are only confined to small and medium sized areas. As you play, more of these areas become available and you can go back if you want to, but this game is mostly linear when it comes to navigating the world itself.There is not enough exploration to go around but I absolutely love the environments - none of the environments repeat. I love the abandoned buildings, hotels, sewers, back alleys and such. It is something that I always wanted to experience in the last two Fallout games but couldn't because of the lack of the said environments, because of the recycled areas with the same textures and objects and because of the outdated engine. This time however I can't stop taking snapshots via Fraps and Steam.There are several types of enemies. Some of the punks however speak with a British accent and have British flag tattoos, but most of them look the same (a homage to Mad Max and Doomsday (2008) perhaps?). There are some other medium and large-sized mutants.I like the fact that there are several vehicles and that you can customize them. There are also several ammo types for each weapon, however all I really ask for is for head shot to equal instant death, which is not the case in this game unless you use a shotgun up close.You can also create some new items that will help you advance in the game as well as access some closed off areas so do not hurry to sell every junk you find because you might need it.As far as the weapons are concerned, well I'd say that most of them get readily available within the first few quests, so you do not really have to work hard to get them. Plus the ammo is not that scarce for some reason, so do not expect any Metro 2033-kind lack of ammo. Also, half of the weapons look like they were taken from Crysis. I would also expect some weapons to be home-made.There' s no way to skip the occasional cut scenes or hurry up the monologue, BUT if you take a few steps away from the person giving you the quest, then the quest becomes readily available without you having to hear the whole story.The enemy AI is good. They dodge bullets, take cover, retreat, advance and throw grenades - everything that you really need. It is also satisfying to blast some of the melee-wielding enemies. They don't always rush at you either, they actually try to surround you.This brings me to another point. The gameplay itself is what truly shines in this game. The fire fights and the shooting just do not get old. It is extremely satisfying to fight the hordes of mutants. You can craft sentry turrets and sentry bots(like in Doom 3) to help you out. You can also craft various types of special ammo, and since there's no weight limit, there's little reason to sell junk that can be used to construct the dozen or so different things.When you die, the nanomachines that were implanted in you moments before the asteroid collision and the subsequent hypersleep serve as a defibrillator. Meaning if you die, you can revive yourself once or twice before the defibrillator recharges. There's a tiny minigame involved that determined how much health you get once you are revived. And by health I mean how red your screen is before it turns normal since the game has regenerative health.The characters you encounter are all unique. They all have different clothes, voices and personalities. Some give you new quests, some just do small chit-chat. The secondary characters even have names.There are some easter eggs scattered around including a few that pay respect to Fallout, like the bobble head and the water purifier chip.The minuses:Let's get this out of the way: You can't see your legs and you cast no shadow.Oh, and you are also mute. All you can do is listen.I like the fact that you do not have any maps or minimaps when you enter new unknown areas ( I don't like excessive HUD), but friendly towns could use some indicators because it causes some confusion when you enter a new friendly place and are trying to navigate between the newly introduced characters and quests.When you drive a vehicle you get a third person view, however you cannot look around or behind you which really constricts your view.The sky looks amazing although it is static. It's like a giant wall paper.The dead bodies disappear quickly, but at least they won't do so unless you loot them. So if you want to increase realism, do not loot the bodies.I don't think I've encountered a single checkpoint or an auto-save. That's right, your entire progress depends on your manual F5 saves, what's more is that every time you save, it takes 4 seconds for the screen to unfreeze. Annoying but necessary. So if you forget to save and die, you will have to repeat your last progress from your last save.The game is also extremely easy. I'm playing on the hardest (Nightmare) mode and I steam roll over everyone and everything. The quick regenerating health is part of the issue.The most important thing is the lack of a good and consistent story. This game nailed almost everything but the main story. You wake up from cryosleep and you get thrown into the semi-open world of fetch quests. For some reason people around you assume that you are a killing machine who is able to take out hordes of enemies and fetch supplies. No one ever explains why you should be doing the things you are doing. One might think that there is no need for one coherent story in the huge 21 GB single player post-apocalyptic world but I beg to differ since this is not an open-world game. You cannot bypass quests and go wherever you want, there ARE constrictions.Overall, the game feels like playing a Mad Max movie with the elements of Borderlands, Fallout, and Some Metro 2033 elements. But that is not to say that any ideas were stolen or re-used for this game. Rage is its own kind of animal, it is unique and it's got plenty of peculiar style. The world is believable and immersive. And the game itself gets better and better as you play it.Highly recommended. "

												Rage is lacking. I did enjoy some of its parts, but mostly it was just that feeling of unused potential.Pros:-	I liked the fighting system, weapons felt okay-	Locations were well-made-	Plot was a bit blunt but turned out okay-	Ability to drive vehicles – I enjoyed that part of the game the most (I always missed that in Fallouts)-	Games world’s atmosphere similar to Fallout’s (but definitely inferior in all the aspects)-	Cities were alright-       I like the graphicsCons –-	Boring races… Seriously that could have been done much, much better…-	Bandits on the roads – annoying-	Not opened world (something that only pretended to be opened, but was really few closed locations connected by closed roads)-	World was boring and too small-	TOO SHORT! Game ended so suddenly…-	Compatibility problems – some of the add ons made my game to crush in my native language (was okay when I changed to English)-	Dreary NPC-	Gameplay “on rails” – no choice where to go or what to do… Just go forward with what game had for you.-	Side quest were… boring…Conclusion,Well, I expected something better…. But maybe my expectations were just a bit too high after playing in masterpieces like Fallout 3 or New Vegas.RATING 3.50/10			"

												Surprisingly, after hearing so much negative press, I find that RAGE is quite enjoyable. The gunplay could use some work at times (a magazine of 7.62x39 should be more than ample to take down a human, when all shots hit the head), but the driving is quite good for a game that's a mix of shooter/driver. I haven't completed the entirety of the campaign yet, as I'm playing through the DLCs at the moment (both of which follow the campaign instead of adding end-game content, though Sewers is part of the base game now) but the story is not nearly as hackneyed as many have accused it of being. It feels like Mad Max, Borderlands, and Car Wars had a disturbing little baby.The weapons are nice, there is a good selection of generic staples (the assault rifle, machine gun, shotgun of course) in addition to some fun takes on things like the crossbow and pistol (which uses a removable cylinder and multiple caliber options--not possible but pretty fun in a video game), minigun toting spider drones, turrets, RC car bombs... it's taken a non-RPG shooter and given it some pretty entertaining, though not genre defining, upgrades.All in all, though it is a Bethsoft published product... it's worth purchasing when on sale.

												This game is great!  After purchasing, I immediately played through it 3 times, trying out the 3 different character classes,  increasing the difficulty and finding more hidden locations each time.There's plenty of variety to the game and it's loads of fun.  The story is sufficiently engaging and the world has an immersive atmosphere.It delivers very well as a shooter and the driving isn't bad either.  The weapons are great - they look/sound good and feel terrific.  Combat is very satisfying.Some (all?) of the guns have alternate ammo types (ie: armor piercing, explosive, electric) which you will learn to use strategically (or to completely steamroll the enemy).It features a fairly unique open world which is fun to explore in your upgradable offroad vehicles which you also get to use to partake in violent races through the badlands.I also think the game looks beautiful as far as settings, NPC's, weapons, vehicles, etc go.

												Put ""Rage"" on your wish list and buy it on sale. ""Rage"" is pretty mediocre. Not *bad*, just mediocre. It plays like an extended tech demo (which is probably is seeing how the marketing is hyping the game engine) that is, it takes the ""kitchen sink"" approach to game design, lacking focus. Everything you could want to do with a  game engine is represented and is polished to a glorious shine and it is shiny, just mediocre. The first person combat is entertaining enough. The driving sections are OK-ish and not actually broken in any way so they get a pass, I guess. There are RPG elements, but they don't *really* matter. There is crafting, which also doesn’t really matter. There is an evil authority, there are vicious mutants and there are good and noble rebels - which in game are called ""The Authority"", ""The Mutants"" and ""The Rebels"". You see? Mediocre. What wasn't strictly mediocre was the enemy AI which would (depending on enemy type) rather effectively take and use cover. This made the combat sections with those enemies stand out from the rest of the game, but not too far out, because this game doesn't really get to far past mediocre.  I would also like to point out that for the PC you will most likely have to create a config file to fix several graphic and performance issues. Once this is done, the game will be beautiful and run very well, but a player should be able to run a game out of the box without having to do this, so instead of ""Rage"" getting and outstanding for polish, it again achieves mediocre.

												The only reason I brought this game was for the co-op.I literally thought the co-op was the campaign, which it is not.You can do the co-op in less than 6 hours and then multiplayer which is fun for abit before you realise that there are only few modes and maps.Graphics: They are actually very good for this game and have a weird style which makes this game very enjoyable with the added graphics. Audio: I find the audio very unique with some very well made sounds from guns to voices...Controls: Very easy to get used too, which is a pickup and go game, seriously it's easy. Game: The campaign is suprisingly fun though, so you will have fun playing it.  It just really really cries to play the campaign co-op which I hoped it would have. The campaign it seems to be very very long, I've been at it hours and not made a dent but has taken me on a wild journey already. The game is decent made, with lots of hidden secrets and thing put around which you might not notice, like a character wearing a Doom T-Shirt.  Fallout 3 bobble head.  Characters names from games, Quake walk arounds etc.This game is unique and fun to play and I hope they make a Rage 2 but do full co-op.Would I recommend this game? Yes because it is a very unique game and worth the money to play if you are after a long story driven diverse different wasteland game.			"

												A fun and intense first person shooter set in the future of wasteland earth. So, it’s a little bit like Mad Max then? Well, it’s about 99% Mad Max-like. I mean you’re going to see insane weaponry, vehicular combat and bandit gangs, so it’s safe to say that this is a Mad Max themed shooter, but definitely not a movie clone. Graphics: 10/10For a game that is nearly 5 years old, it still impresses me on how good it looks. It’s not “perfect” by any means, but its good enough that you will think that this game is newer than it looks. Not to mention that you don’t need an overly powerful graphics card to run it; a GeForce 9800 GTX or an AMD equivalent is just enough to get playable framerates. This also goes for both the CPU and RAM. No need for a fancy £1000 rig to enjoy this game. Storyline: 7/10You are emerged into a wasteland earth full of bandits, gangs and mutants. You are seen as the ‘hero’ of the game and you learn more about the places and the people the more you play further into the story. It’s the generic story where you defeat all the mutants and gangs, whilst doing unrelated side-quests along the way and eventually “save” the world. It’s nothing new to the table in terms of storytelling and I wouldn’t personally call this one “story heavy”, the game is an experience and is for experience, not to be fully immersed in it. It certainly delivers that experience in a decent sense. Sound: 10/10The sounds of gunfire, the roaring engines and the clarity of the voice acting is at its best. Every bit of soundtrack has been fined tuned to sound how they were supposed to be heard. I am proud of what id Software did here. What an impressive achievement. Gameplay: 9/10It delivers very smooth and very polished gameplay that many is sure to enjoy for hours. The controls are responsive and the game difficulty is well balanced. The only downside is that you have to keep checking if you have enough ammo for a weapon as ammo in this game is very scarce, especially at the start of the game. Price: 10/10For the price of £12.99 and an additional £3.49 for a DLC, it is reasonably well priced and is definitely worth buying. Although, I suggest waiting until it goes on sale to get it.  "

												Been playing this game for last few weeks, completed the SP Campaign today. GunPlay & Combat Races are awesome, It has some Graphical Flaws which can be fixed. I like the variety in weapons each with mulitple ammo mods, the Spider Turrent was very cool. The campaign ending was huge LET DOWN!, final battle in Scorchers DLC was way better though. Overall a Very Good Gun & Run Game. Recommended for any Hardcore FPS/Shooter Fans.			"

												Visually Rage is a work of art. The id artists are responsible for some of the most amazing environments and artwork I have seen yet. The game itself has a half ♥♥♥♥♥ feeling; some rpg elements, some driving/racing bits, leveling up in the form of ammo enhancements etc, none of which are very deep. Cliched dialog, characters and quests don't help. The combat is great and feels id solid and a simple multiplayer(shooting not driving) would have worked.			"

												RAGE is a difficult game for me to recommend or even describe my thoughts on. On one hand, there is one main (and important aspect) to the game that the game nails in spades (imo). However, on every other hand the game fails to deliver with…just about everything else. For me: The most important aspect to a videogame is that of its gameplay. With that in my mind on games, RAGE, to me, is the biggest counterexample to that claim that I have ever seen and played.The basic premise is an asteroid fell to Earth and ravaged the planet creating the homeland and setting to the main game, the Wasteland. You play as an Ark survivor who awakens to find the rest of your Ark members dead. Afterwards, you activate a panel that opens the door and step out into the desolate world. You enter the Wasteland and encounter some of the enemies that you will be fighting later on your journey and after being saved by Dan Hagar (played by John Goodman). You and him set off for town to begin your adventure and help in the ongoing battle against the bandits who rule the Wasteland.Right off the bat, story wise, you can tell this isn't going to be any more than just a slapped on, Grade B, generic story that's sole purpose is a background for you and your rampant annihilation that you bring onto the enemies of the Wasteland. To be fair, id isn't really a company well known for their story telling, characters, or even their open worlds like say the Fallout series. However, in RAGE it feels like id was putting more emphasis on story and characters than their previous works; it felt as if id really wanted to break free from their simplistic shooter roots of just running and gunning with barely and reasoning behind except, ""Screw it! Why not?"" That and the modern warfare market the FPS genre lives in now makes it difficult for future FPS games to not include it in the main game. Either way, the singleplayer portion of RAGE story wise is painfully average at best with characters that are barely memorable or interesting; they leave absolutely no impression on you and are there solely to have you help them in the form of missions. Missions in the game aren't really good either, they're your standard RPG-esque affair of, ""Clear out X area."" Just like about everything else in the game, missions are typical, offer no variety, and ontop of everything else is uninteresting and stock; it makes for one very average package. Voice acting is decent, some voices sound rather strange for the setting they're in and some voices don't feel right with their character design but otherwise the voice acting isn't too terrible, but, with such stock and uninteresting characters it hardly matters. Again, this wouldn't be too much of a big deal given id's previous works but considering how much more emphasis id has put on the world and the characters this time around it's a shame that this is the end result.The big surprise for me, though, was in the graphics. Graphically, RAGE is stunning; the textures are crisp, the detail is insane, and the models on characters are incredibly well done as well as their animations. Id's new Tech 5 engine is quite a looker and is better than most of the other engines FPSs and games in general are running on these days. What really stuns me is just how well the graphics worked for my PC; I'm not well versed in PC terminology and graphic fidelity but here's what I will say: I can barely play Skyrim on high without my computer struggling to run 15 FPS let alone 30; RAGE, however, was buttery smooth throughout my whole time playing it. The game didn't lag for me, I didn't need to downgrade the graphics, and, besides a few graphical issues here and there, looked absolutely amazing and ran impeccably well given my machine. Graphically, RAGE looks incredible but visually, it's very unappealing; that does more or less have to do with the setting at hand rather than the art department’s fault plus I’m not a fan visually of post-apocalyptic settings. Even if I was I feel RAGE would still disappoint me on that ground; it lacks any personality and doesn't stand out from the rest. It has no defining characteristics and is just as stock and generic as the characters that inhabit the world. Yes, it is a post-apocalyptic setting so it's rather hard for the game to have ""personality"" but, come on. You can't say that no games set in the post-apocalyptic future setting don’t have personality. Again, going back to the Fallout series, some of the games have personality to them and are much more interesting than anything and anybody in RAGE. Graphics are great on RAGE and look great on my PC, it's just that the graphics that make up the world are uninteresting and lack any real defining characteristic that sets it apart from the rest.As stated previously, the biggest aspect that this game and id knock out of the ballpark is the gameplay (well, half of it at least). Keep in mind, I have not played a previous id title before RAGE; I have seen footage of their other work but I have never really played any of their other games so I have no previous knowledge on how well their previous FPS mechanic offerings have been. I can say, though, that between all my other FPS games that I've played previously, RAGE might just be the best that I've played in that aspect. Every gun feels excellent and meaty to use, gunning down enemies is a blast, and besides one gun (shotgun wasn't really as good as I was hoping it would be) all the guns sound great to fire; though, in my time with the game there were barely any guns outside of the pistol, shotgun, assault and sniper rifle, and rocket launcher. RAGE isn't as fast paced as Doom or Quake so there is a little bit of weight and slowness to your character but even with that restriction the FPS mechanics in RAGE are some of the best I've seen since the original Crysis.On top of the excellent FPS mechanics, RAGE also offers racing and car combat gameplay. Driving mechanics, for the most part, aren't to terrible; there were some weird moments like whenever I made a reversal U-Turn so that I could go back and destroy the bandit's buggies I turn a little faster than when I'm turning normally so instead of a 180 degree turn around it was like a slight 270 degree instead. It was weird and frustrating but for the most part the driving is pretty solid in the game; it's just not as good as the FPS mechanics and is really only used as a means of travel. Car combat I found, mechanically speaking, OK but personally for me I just found it rather boring more than anything else. Also should mention that I have not played a single second of the multiplayer as, from what I've heard, the multiplayer focuses more on the driving and car combat aspect. I also didn't play any co-op because, I had no idea co-op was even apart of RAGE. Though, honestly, co-op is co-op, it's practically a given at this point that with friends co-op can be an absolute blast especially if co-op focuses more on the FPS part of RAGE than the multiplayer did.Overall, RAGE is a difficult game for me to like. It nails the FPS gameplay and the graphics are great but everything else in the package ranges from decent to below average. There's barely any creativity to the game, you don't care for anything or anybody in the game, strange design choices, while OK not a fan of the driving or car combat, and because of the emphasis on story and characters the game pulls you out of the gameplay more so than it should. RAGE is not a bad game, but it is a very weak game given the id's broad history. Keep in mind I only played it for 12 hours if even that, maybe later the game picks up the pace but from what I played these are the feelings I am left with. If you can focus more on the meaty and excellent FPS mechanics more so than I could then you'll probably find RAGE a more enjoyable game. If not then there's not much else that the game really has going for it so my advice: skip it.			"

												There are so many amazing things about this game, it is entirely underrated. Unfortunately a lack of marketing combined with the overall lack of content are what ultimately made this game less successfull than its 2011 classmates such as Skyrim. With that said, to this day this is easily one of my favorite games that I have played. What the game lacks in content is makes up for a million times in character, beauty and overall fluid gameplay.In comparison, RAGE vs. Bioshock (any of them) Rage wins in actual gameplay and mechanics while Bioshock would win with the strong storyline. They are  both incredible games, but put the stoy-type that Bioshock has into this game and honestly you have the perfect FPS game.I'll start with Cons:-The game is short, there is no way around it.-There is more more that they could have done with the 'racing' aspect of this game. It really is more of a mini game within the game but it offered versatility in a fairly constricting game.-This is a FPS with linear story progression, there is very minimal sandbox-type capabilitiesThe Pros:-Gameplay is just delightful-Weapons are varied and the bow with environment interavtivity and ammunition types is just increible.-The various ways to approach every single fight whether it is through exploding remote cars, guns blazing, etc... The game boasts strong versatility in gameplay.-TONS of mini-games within the game that are all pretty fun.-The story is very entertaining-The game is full of vibrant characters and monsters-The art style is great-The graphics are just beautiful considering a 2011 release date.-The engine was truely a pioneer, boasting ZERO, I repeat, NO replicated areas or terrain types. (To explain, in most games, areas are replicated, reconfigured and reskinned. For example, in Fallout you may notice that a lot of areas are quite similar. This does not happen in RAGE as the engine was developed to be able to specifically alter each area, each rock, each spray painted wall.) "

												One of my favorite games thus far. Yes, it's old(ish). Yes, it's linear. Yes, it's hella fun. Whether I was blasting mutants with a shotgun or tearing it up in a rocket ralley, this game never failed to keep me entertained. I'd give it a 9/10 for the wingsticks alone. It's a great game with a great story that I haven't forgotten since I beat it two years ago. id postboned Rage 2 for DOOM, so hopefully we will see a Rage 2 at an E3 down the road.

												RAGE is a mix of FPS and Driving genres, set in post-apocalyptic desert setting and with some dose of RPG elements, this comes in form of inventory and hub world. Yep, still developed by id Software, who mostly were doing FPS games, and released in 2011, published by Bethesda by that time. It runs on id Tech 5, main point of which were mega-textures.There were few versions of RAGE. If you pre-ordered then you would recieve Anarchy Edition. You can also buy it separately but no on Steam. Anarchy included few unique items to make players more powerful, including Double Shotgun. From what I understand some of Anarchy editions came with code for Sewers DLC. You could also buy this DLC separately on consoles. There are also some comics and ""making of"" videos, Collector Edition came with those. And then there was Campaign Edition for Mac OS X that included Anarchy Edition content plus Sewer DLC, but was singleplayer-only.While Steam version is not Anarchy Edition, it comes with Sewers DLC for free. And that's good, because this DLC gives sewers levels that are filled with mutants which can challenge you only in the very beggining. Not something worth after beating game.As far as I know the only good difference between consoles and PC is that consoles support split-screen for multiplayer.The thing is that this game apparently was hyped as being really open-world RPG, but in the end people got hub of corridors between each traditional level, making people dissapointed. And because id is a brand and people expect revolution, even though id only did it with Doom1/Quake1 long time ago. And since people want everything post-apocalyptic game to be either Fallout or Borderlands, well, it got underrated.Technically, it had a lot of problems at the launch. John Carmack came up with new feature called Mega-Textures. You may think of it as super-detailed textures, but what it means is that artists can can place something nice in one spot without it looping all over the wall. He must have been expected that hardware people would be the one who would rush to give proper support for that feature, but RAGE wasn't Quake 1 and no one cared. And so majority of players experienced huge issues with textures pop-in, where everything will take seconds to become clear when you look at it. Thankfully, game was patched around and hardware moved ever since, so it should be fine now.At least it shows that programming fancyness of John Carmack is better at developing cutting edge VR tech than games, where ""can most average players hardware run it"" is more important.It also has a multiplayer component. Which is being run by lobby system. And community of which is quite dead.It has two modes. No, not Deathmatch and Capture The Flag.The first mode is Road Rage, which is competetive and uses Racing genre of a game. Has a few sub-modes and is designed for 4 players. Didn't get to play it. Just check YouTube for gameplay.Second mode is Wasteland Legends - cooperative FPS. It's designed for 2 players and seems to use unique short missions. Or you could play them in singleplayer, alone. Well, not all that unique, it uses assets from single-player, but it's not same layouts. Plotwise they tell stories of behind-the-scene events, something silly like ""how Dan got Sniper Rifle"". There are no inventories, few weapons, you occasionally come across supply which will max out your ammo, if you run out of defib then your friend will have to come and revive you. Not much value for singles, better drag a friend into it.And yes, as many people will tell you, plot isn't good. For RPG. If forget that this is mainly linear FPS/Racing game. So it does job fine. Then again, seeing the hype it was dissapointed. But don't worry, setting combined with amazing graphics are still fun. Seeing all the new amazing NPC designs and hearing the way that each enemy clan communicates with each other, as well as finding out in what enviroment they live, is what was the driving force for me. Game also has great atmoshpere. It goes from surviving wasteland, to more of feeling of just well-stocked desert and then ends with more of techy and resistance feel.The bad thing is ending. If you played enough id games then you will be smart not to expect epilogues. And then many games have some ""you are awsome"" ending, teaching players to appericate journey, not the ending. But then this time they forgot to put final boss or any climax battle in. You just got this cool gun that can shoot BFG rounds and you just derp through weak enemies. Still, not a huge flaw.As for gameplay, it's a classic id shooter. Well, in modern linear level design, where you have one path and any other path is usually filled with knee-tall trash that you can't get over. But the shooting and action itself is great fun. Do people still consider having 9 weapons at same time as old-school?Weapons can use different kidn of ammo types. Like shocking water with elector-bolts. Or beating the hell out of heavy armor guys by loading your pistol with Fat Mammas.And you have a few items you can use, most notably explosive RC cars, placing turrets and using wingstick. Wingsticks is a boomerang that homes at enemy, is strong and can even return succesfully. It's Rage's title weapon, so to say. Shame that whether it breaks or returns seem to be based around randomness than skill.Animations of enemies makes it feel like proper FPS too and not some RPG, with them getting wounded while running, falling onto ground and shooting at you from there. It's mostly hitscan-abuse type of game, but at least regenerating health keeps it sane. And defib, where you can still revive after death. Most common enemies are melee ones that rush you straight or ranged ones that hide behind cover. What is great is that later they take more hits than your average modern FPS cannon fodder and can maneuver around, while giving a look of intellegent enemies by communicating, making it dynamic. It also helps that each clan is a bit unique, like Shadow clan has bandits that are more acrobatic.I once got sneakily killed from shotgun from behind, so it's cool.Racing/Driving part takes a secondary place sadly. It delivers finely, in that you can drive between missions in a hub world or do a racing. Boosting, minigun and rocket-launching and all that. It has arcade physics and feel to it, aside from having to purchase ammo. But it doesn't have much aside from shooting rockets at enemy. And racing events don't have many tracks and don't seem to be too crazy, they just kinda get repetetive after a while. It still a good part with explosions and ramming, just not deep. If they had some physics rampage and destroyable objects, then at least it could be as ""aw yeah"" as Flatout games.You also get some open-world stuff that are very few towns. Where you can grab some quests of racing. Or play some not interesting mini-games. Cards one is kinda cool. Or you can take a job quest, which is mostly redoing the beaten levels. Still cool lively locations, but don't put focus on them. Don't forget to purchase some ammo and ingridients. Game has too many ammo for few weapons to be survival, but very few for stuff like Sniper Rifle. Oh, and you can craft. This game also gives a bit of survival feel by making you scavenge, picking various trash in missions to sell it later.Main issue with it is that it doesn't manage to mix FPS and Driving well. Those are kept separately. Hub and races for cars, missions and towns for on-foot. Which may be good, as FPS people have to beat only 2 mandatory races. But still, could make it more interesting this way.Oh, and music provides background for action and varied but nothing to remember. And there were like, two bosses.But overall, if you come here for your linear id Software FPS with a bit of racing and not some Fallout or Borderlands, then you will have fun there. Hub world with linear missions are still good games.			"

												I am really baffled by how much Id missed the mark on this. Aside from the blatant copying of Fallout and Borderlands, the game doesn't really do much to peak any interest in the post-apocalyptic-FPS-barren-wasteland-desert-survival games. Like, Doom and Quake, Rage just continues to throw enemies at you as you trek through the same areas over and over (and sometimes backwards). Yes other games make you return to the same areas (Borderlands) but Rage's linear single hallway design makes it tiresome. The racing feels so out of place and the in-game economy is very broken. Yes it's pretty when you're looking at stuff far away, but when you're close it's really gross. No wonder Carmack left Id.			"

												The only problems with the game is that it is too short, it lacks content and is limited on explorable land/areas.- AMAZING story- AMAZING gameplay- Very unique in almost ALL of its aspects- Beautiful graphics - Cool npcs...- The list goes on and on.Its unfortunate however that the game had SO much more potential and I WISH they included more and perhaps even a more open world as I loved the story and path of the protagonist (even though the protagonist himself lacked importance - perhaps because he had no voice) and simply would have given this a 10/10 if there were more towns/interesting places to visit.Therefore im forced to give the game an 8 out of 10 :P Still amazing. Praying that they release RAGE 2 with a more open world/longer story line to follow.			"

												As single-player FPS, it's quite good (if easy). Imagine Borderlands but with better characters and upgraded graphics. Controls are responsive, and there are very few cutscenes or slow character animations to interfere with gameplay.Unfortunately, you'll spend almost as much time driving cars as you will shooting guns, and as a driving game, it's overly simple and not much fun. No multiplayer.If you have a fast enough computer to run this at the higher graphics settings and if its on sale cheap enough, this is worth picking up for the eye candy... but don't expect to replay it.

												This one's a mixed bag for me. For one, the story is pretty good, considering the usual stuff we get in FPS at least. It's interesting, well written and it's got good dialouge. Just don't expect Metal Gear levels of depth and you'll be fine. Gameplay-wise it's also on the good side, with varying locations and enemy types as well as good boss battles. Don't go in expecting this to be fallout though, as much as it is ""open world"", the world is fairly small with not a lot to do in it, compared to other open world games.The AI is servicable if predictable, they will however react to getting shot in different ways depending on where you shoot them (yes, that includes groin-shots). Overall, pretty good again. This game also has a fairly big focus on verhicles and racing aswell as vehicular combat.What kills it for me is the port. The mouse acceleration and -smoothing is oh so very strong with this one, and you need to dig in the config files to get rid of it. And trust me, just setting mouse sensetivity to zero doesn't help. The performance is equally bad. Even on my GTX 760 I can't play this game on any higher than medium setting without having the framerate go lower than 30. And the texture pop-in is massive, it can take take multiple seconds to load texture if you turn.Conclusion: I'd recommend this game for anyone who was gonna use a controller anyways or is willing to fix stuff themselves. I've had my fun with it (~20 to get through with the campaign and some of the sidestuff) and don't regret the purchase.			"

												The whole idea sounds like fun: doom meets post apocalyptic wasteland with an open world. The only problem is that the wasteland is a carefully built walled garden with no openness at all (invisible walls galore) - actually it felt like a dated corridor shooter. The graphics are quite nice, but I'd rather play with brutal doom with a couple of mods than this one.			"

												Rage is an interesting game considering its pedigree. It was a game that was released too late. Allow me to explain.Rage had many features that were standard in the industry by the time it was released, which made the game feel like it was either behind the times or just not developed with enough substance. I felt it impossible to not compare it to other games that were released in the same time frame and felt that it brought little unqiue gameplay mechanics to the table. The tropes of older games are also present such as bountiful backtracking, red shirt enemies and linear layouts disguised as open world.Had this game came out a few years earlier I think I would have received it better, but the entire time I was playing the game, it reminded me of something better I had already played. So take my ""Not recommended"" with a gain of salt.			"

												Mind numbing missions, that provide zero motivation.Paper thin plot.Average gunplay.Very linear.I have only been able to play 2 hours of this game because the texture pop-in is so extremely distracting. Nothing is cached so any 180 degree movement causes the world to be plastered with textures lower resolution than the original Quake for a second. Graphics are well done so are the animations, thats really all this game has going for it. Not a bad game, I enjoyed it initially but it is missing character, substance, storyline.			"

												Great game. Just finished it there. Really enjoyed the vast majority of it. Excellent fps, puts many modern cash-grab shooters to shamePros:- Excellent environments: immersive, atmospheric, detailed, unique- Novel weapons- Very good crafting system- Various enemy types- Interesting and unique NPCs- Long Polished campaign, you get more than your money's worth.Cons:- Ending isn't very fleshed outIt should be noted that a small few of the weapons are crap on the higher difficulties. This is frustrating at first, but it promotes the use of some of the more unusual ammo (rebars, pop rockets, kill-bursts) which makes for a way better experience. There are many ammo types, some really unique, which makes it great fun to experiment.			"

												Some days I thought of on what game to make the review, and here Rage fell into hands. The distinct plot in Rage actually begins and comes to an end with an introductory roller. The asteroid Apofis slowly flies by through external limits of Solar system, punches a huge hole in one of rings of Saturn, at all takes down a half of the Moon and under sad music falls to the Ground. There for the guest already wait — participants of the special Ark project plunge into hibernation in underground shelters to wake up in many years and to restore the destroyed civilization. You — one of the volunteers chosen for burial, and your ark after more than hundred years of expectation at last wakes up and at the same time awakes you. All other inhabitants of a shelter were lost as a result of refusal of life support systems, behind a window — the desert filled in with the sun. Welcome to the wonderful new world. Everything that occurs after that, only creates visibility of advance. To you don't explain with sense that occurs around, don't help to get used to the new world, don't represent the villain who wants to be destroyed immediately and without trace. NPC constantly give different tasks, but each new mission is desperately similar on previous, and all of them as a whole are necessary only in order that you had a formal occasion to go to the next cellar and to pull a metaphorical eye on a metaphorical ♥♥♥ to the next company of mutants. No real subject movement in Rage happens. The same history — from an automobile component of game which developers too very much advertized. In reality cars are necessary to move first of all between not numerous settlements and kvestovy locations. In the second — for participation in boring races, whose only mission — to allow you to lift enough means to buy new wheels or to decorate the car with skulls. Fortunately, it is not all that is in Rage. It at all the most important. Because the main events of game are developed in catacombs and mines, underground dens and laboratories. To put it briefly, in an action part. And here is how a pure shooter of Rage — one of the most fascinating and worthy games this year. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).			"

												Gaphical Fidelity: ID outdid themselved with the visuals of this game. The texture qualities themselves may not be astounding. But the vastness of the world and details of each individual component make it quite a breath-taking sight. For me, it is still one of the most visually appealing games i've played. The artstyle is damn impressive.Performance: As much as i'd like to say all good things about this game. The texture popping is something that was an issue on release, and still has not been properly patched till this day. It's not a major issue, and not too noticeable on my computer rig, but it doesn't exactly make ID look like they put a lot of time into fixing the game.Design: I love the character and map design. Each enemy type has so many different variations, it doesn't feel too repetetive when fighting them. Plus the characters you talk to are each unique and memorable in their own way, wether it be serious and rought around the edges, or kind of goofy.RPG Aspects: This is something that kind of looks like it was shoved in last second. Don't get me wrong, it works, but it feels unfinished. You don't have any stats you can mess around with for your character. The clothing you wear is picked out of 3 different variations near the beginning of the game, meaning not a lot of variety. There are basic upgrades for armour, and for your individual weapons, but they are very basic. The coolest part would probably be the item crafting. Even though it is quite simple. It makes you go looking for the unique parts required to make certain items, such as the explosive RC cars, lock drills, bandages, etc.Story: Honestly, story could have been better. It sets the tone quite early on and I quite liked how it began, but without spoiling anything, the ending was a bummer and quite of left you hanging. Plus, you can't continue playing after the campaign to explore which I thought was silly. The ending really allowed for it...Voice Acting: Voice acting was fantastic, I don't have any issues with it. Frankly they had me at John Goodman.AI: The enemies AI was frankly one of the best parts of the game. They aren't your typical baddies that just stand there or rush directly at you. They were far cleverer than I expected. I found that enemies with melee weapons would duck and weave to avoid your shots, plus jumping, rolling and climbing to make them quite adept at reaching you without being hit. Any with ranged weapons wouldn't just stand there, but use cover wisely. Retreat if you were bearing down hard on them, advance if they found they had an advantage. Not just that, sometimes they would work together; for instance, the Authority had units that defended with a energy shield, and other units would hide behind him for protection.Weapons: The weapon design was quite good, but what made the guns so much fun to use, is their sounds, kickback, and also the phsyics implemented when an enemy was downed. If you shot an enemy in the head, their helmet would fall off, shoot them in the leg, they'll limp or topple over. Hit them with a shotgun, they'd go barreling through the air. As a FPS, I absolutely approve, and found the shooting aspect solid.____________________Presentation: 7 (Clearly high production, but story was weak and not all the characters were that memorable)Graphics: 7.5 (I would of given this a higher rating if the texture popping issue was fixed)Sound: 8.5 (Sound was overall impressive, especially on the weapons. Plus voice acting was above par most of the time)Gameplay: 8 (Excellent shooting sequences, but I did find the car comabt kind of tedious)Overall: 8 (A large amount of content for Single player, but only about 7-8 hours for the campaign. Does include co-op missions and a car combat competetive mode which is nice)			"

												Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II is a truly amazing game. From the realistic breast physics to the immersive slap noises that occur during biker segments, it is truly a game worthy of praise. You begin as a Sonic looking for his parents who were killed by Batman during the Great Depression. As the game progresses, you learn more about Batman, coming to the conclusion that he is actually a carton of Mtn. Dew in disguise. It's a great message to send the new generation, informing them that caffinated drinks are the root of all evil.Following the events of Batman's unmasking, Sonic suddenly realizes what his true purpose is, and transforms into Mario because Nintendo is better than Sega. EA drops from the sky and challenges you to a fight before immediately decomposing into a pile of ♥♥♥♥-covered money. After wading through the ♥♥♥♥ and avoiding flying ♥♥♥♥-covered money, you finally find and confront Batman, killing him because Superman will always win.Mario then re-transforms back into Sonic before succumbing to his wounds, stating the core message of the game - that I've never played it.

												Amazing game! Great gameplay, stunning visuals and interesting characters. This game just has the full package! The story sets in a post-war, apocalyptic world, and the visuals could not be better. From the landscapes to the tiny details, everything looks great with a unique art style that reminds borderlands. The gameplay is probably the strongest point in Rage, and it was probably the main focus of the producers. And what a great job they did! I was actually searching for a FPS that suited my gameplay style, and Rage just hit the spot. It has loads of guns, some of them pretty creative, lots of different ammo for each weapon, turrets, RC bomb cars, you name it. It has diferent enemies too, which requires you to play a different style against each one, and has some fun bosses too. The roaming areas are open world, while the shooting areas are narrow spaces, clearly telling you where to go (despite sometimes I get lost for a moment, but that's becaus I like to search every bit of floor searching foor goods :P). This game also has a car racing component, which is not bad at all. you can roam in the open world by car (or other ground vehicles) and you can race with them. The driving is quite arcade, keeping it simple, but is well balanced, nevertheless. The vehicles also have diferent weapons to shoot the other vehicles, so there's that. The characters in this game are rich and well done, and despite of what they say to you won't be crucial information, you just want to listen to them, because of how interesting they are.The only downside in my opinion is the story. While it promisses a good story at the start,  the story simply doesn't develop too much, wasting all the potential it had. This game also has some few frequent minor bugs related to the image, like showing the desktop for a fraction of a second (nothing to worry about). Overall, a really great game for people who just want to have a nice session of shooting, repeating their favorite missions on the highest difficulties (and they are challenging) and dont care that much about the story. Highly recomend it! :)			"

												Very fun yet very basic shooter. That said, I'm enjoying it a lot. Is very classic, for example, you really don't need to use the aim button as in CoD to be accurate, since in normal view you already have almost perfect accuracy. Also is very old school in the sense that you can carry a bunch of weapons with you, and not just 2. The scenario is great I must say, incredibly beautiful and full of detail, so if you're looking for shooting in cool futuristic environments with lots of weapons and also do some fast speed driving, this game is definitely for you.In the technical side, for me works almost perfectly maxed out.

												i have this game sleeping on steam for a long  time now. but never finish it.is like a doom game mixed with fallout rpg elements, and some cars  races.the game its fun for what it is,look pretty solid and the graphics looks awsome, but you have to tweaks them, with the guide, to make them work and look properly. And the core  problem at the same time are the graphics, the poping of the textures and its low resolution can be very annoyng, they appear seconds late in the world when you move, so the most time when you turn fast, all you see is the grey geometry of the game being cover with the low  textures, is  distracting as hell and can take you away from the inmersive experience. if you got a great and powerfull card abobe a 600 series nvidia or the same power card from ATI , maybe can reduce the problem , and the guide on the steam community can help a lot, to get rid of this problem, never was officially fixed.the other issue is the  plot story, is missing something, to make it really oustanding, like a doom managing the horror survival aspects,  well this is most the tasking survival, go here do this go there, and bla bla, its fun the first hour and then its get very repetitive, and also touch the boring aspects for moments, because they RPG elements, are lousy driven, trough the develop of the cars, and the character weapon cutomization, who appears a ♥♥♥♥ing robot ,so the game is like 6,7 to me, its good but it appears lacking for strong aspects to make it work, its  worth it if you get the drop sales+nice graphics+some nice variations in the gameplay+some ´´doom´´ feeling about it, from the guys of doom and quake- boring and loose plot story-not character development and bland rpg elements -have to follow a guide to make the game look good with 8k textures			"

												The last game directed by John Carmack before he left id Software.  The game between beginning to end has very enjoyable gameplay, variety of environments, a nice sense of an open world environment, excellent presentation but lacks the explosive ending or ""boss"" that most were expecting from a id Software game towards the end.  Vehicles have a nice sense of weight and momentum but lacks vehicle selection, and upgrades.  The vehicle combat is excellent especially in arenas which are started in the few cities layed out in the game.  Overall 7/10+ Excellent graphics and good optimization for PC+ Enemy animation and gunplay+ vehicle physics and gameplay+ Excellent controls with gamepad- ending was very disappointing- lack of weapon variety- invisible walls take away from the sense of exploration- (from the - above) feels very linear- final enemy environment feels unexciting "

You can not miss this game.There are a lot of things to do, missions, bets, races, minigames, etc.In town. You can get main quests to continue the story or get side quests to get money or races flags to buy things, weapons, supplies, vehicle upgrades, etc. Or you can sell your treasures for money.Wasteland. There are bandits that will take you off so you have to take them of before by shoot them or crash them with you veh.You won't be bored if play this game(fast).

												Honestly, after hours invested; I found myself seeing the whole exercise as pointless. As with many games, there just wasn't enough to keep this first person shooter fan attached after the first few hours. Yah the world is expansive to a limit, but the bad guys were just other AI that seemed to be interested in my doom for no reason other than to keep the game going. It has all the right parts but it is assembled in a way that does not exemplify the genre. I guess my age is showing here; kids would undoubtedly drive around the world forcing conflict for days I am sure. The initial part of the game was interesting but had an odd pace and oddly placed out-takes. I played this game a while ago so if they have changed it or added to the format in some way then it might be worth another replay but I will not invest my money or valuable time in it again. I do not dislike the game, it simply did not fit my expextations. As for other shooters, I will not speculate - play it and find out for yourself.			"

As the game progresses, i found the perfect combination ow weapons, the pistol with fat mamas for any enemy, and the shotgun with poprockets for the mutants, with the nanosticks as backup. The game is worth playing more than once, and the new DLC levels are well worth the purchase. The only complaint I have is I wish ID would come out with more DLC, I give RAGE 5 stars.			"

												RAGE is one of those games that I love to hate. I frequently find myself wanting to punch my screen, and continue on at the same time.I started this game on Ultra Nightmare difficulty because I am somewhat of a masochist. I held my own after learning the mutants attack patterns, and figured I could progess slowly through the game using a decent plan of attack and ammo conservation. I quickly realized that not only would I never finish a Bash TV episode without a hypochondriac's collection of bandages, but I also could not win a race that involved a time clock. I spent the entirety of my UN attempt broke and without ammo in my guns and my car. I was basically reloading the same pathetic attempts to ""luck out"" without pulling my hair out of my scalp.After 20 plus hours of this anxiety attack inducing frustration I dialed it down to Nightmare and have been progressing at a steady rate. I am totally addicted to the game when it comes to fps combat and enemy commentary. I find myself giggling as much the last time I heard ""Hey he killed what's-his-name!"" as I did the first. I have found most of the weapons have a direct purpose at least once, and the art style is somewhat of a favorite of mine.The downsides I have noticed as a current player of at least mediocre knowledge of the game would definitely include the racing controls and overall uselessness of most weapons in the game. I am not using a gamepad so maybe that contributes to my problem, but it seems like the more I upgrade my cars the worse they perform. Every situation I use the car in (combat races, open world, time trial, etc) the car seems to perform differently. I assume there is some form of scaling invovled in different scenarios, but I don't know if that's true. Either way it keeps me from grasping a familiarity with the vehicle I have invested in, and takes away from the overall level of enjoyment when it comes to racing. Once I have the story mode racing achievements finished I'll probably avoid it all together on future playthroughs.The weapon selection is farily decent for a standard single player game of this kind. The problem for me is that even on Nightmare (and Ultra Nightmare for a short time) I find myself using four guns. Two of them for all average encounters and two of them for special ones. I used standard buckshot in the shotgun and steel tipped bolts in the crossbow in every fight I find myself in. Crossbow is for human combat, and the shotgun is for mutant combat. I never bother with anything else leaving most of my weapons forever ammo capped. In circumstances out of the norm I use the double barrel shotgun (Anarchy DLC ftw) armed with Pop Rockets, and the pistol armed with Fat Mamas or Killstrikes. The double barrel with Pop Rockets takes down any large scale boss or DLC related special mutants in seconds, and the pistol with said custom ammo destroys armored humans in a similar fashion after I shoot off their helmet using the crossbow. Perhaps my experience will change once I reach the end of the story and battle the Authority, but that has yet to be discovered. I find the automatic rifles to be ammo dumps that destroy my accuracy overall, and even with armor piercing rounds just feel totally underwhelming. The nailgun fits into that category as well, and I haven't used it since I finished the achievements related to it. I know its ammo is retrieveable (rebar only), but so are crossbow bolts that don't take 4 seconds to reload.The crafting system is keeping me interested until I have all the schematics aquired. I mostly only use it for turrets (still trying to kill 5 enemies for the Steam achievement and will probably have to do this on normal difficulty) and lock grinders for obvious reasons. I only spend four more dollars on bandages if I just buy them compared to buying the pieces (Crimson Elite armor from Anarchy DLC ftw) and after earning $40,000 at the poker machine 4 bucks just isn't all that much compared to crafting time. So basically the best part of this system is crafting my pistol ammo. Kudos for putting a crafting system in, but 90 percent of the time I'll just skip it.Multiplayer in RAGE seems like an afterthought. I generally don't get too invovled in fps multiplayer modes due to general lack of interest, but in RAGE the coop was very fun for a few days. The voice chat feature worked great and saved me from needing to be on my Mumble client. My friend and I cleared everything on both difficulites except three missions. We never finished the Bash TV episodes on Nightmare (good God), and due to an end level glitch we could not finish Grab and Go on Nightmare.Also, where are all the people for the races? Even on the f2p weekend I saw no one on it. We sat for quite a while and I tried solo que a few times with no luck. Two Steam achievements I won't get unless I get two more people on my friends list who have the game and we just que up with four of us. C'mon now...so many in game badges based on the multiplayer races and no one is attempting it? Requiring four people before I can even launch the race keeps us forever alone. Seems like a waste to me, but then again maybe I just missed the golden era for this games racing mode.After almost 40 hours in my playthrough (I take my time and try not to miss anything...the first playthrough is the most important to me) I already know I will at some point play this through again. Most likely on Ultra for the achievement and normal to clean up any missed achievements after that. This game offers much more than some folks would have you believe as long as you can get past the occasional pop in and fairly standard story line. I would definitely invest in future DLC or anytihng related to this game.			"

												RAGE presents the most solid FPS experience to date, the controls are perfect, smooth and plays out just how you'd want them to, which isn't suprising considering ID software is the father of the FPS genre. They try to expand the genre by adding vehicular combat, and some RPG elements, but unfortually, these aspects of the game, while not entirely bad, dont compete with the FPS portions of the game.

The gameplay and game mehanics are really diverse and it is full of extra activities like races, finger fillet and all sorts of gambling,The only thing that I dont really like about the game is that is short. It feels like the game has all the elements to be a big game ... but it isn't. The multiplayer aspect of the game is interesting but there is not a big player base that actually do that - it's also a little bit buggy.All in all, I am really happy with this game, and in my opinion game is really worth the money.

												Awesome game!!! It looks like if Fallout and Borderlands had a baby. Finally, driving vehicles is possible and enjoyable! (Not like freaking mouse steering ""shtako"" in Borderlands.) The interaction with NPCs, the quests, the minigames, the easter eggs, the wingsticks - AWESOME. Dealing with enemies is just fun. You can collect or buy parts and build your own turrets, bots, RC bomb-cars... I just wanted the game be bigger, because you obviously want the good things last longer. The ending is just... Ending - and that's it. But it is not about the ending, it's about the journey... 100% recommendation. As a huge fan, I had to have the Anarchy edition too. And yes I also have the Scorchers DLC which was worth buying. SPOILER: Don't expect any nasty things with Sarah... ;)			"

												Actually, this game not so bad with singleplayer, it has great animation and game graphical, but color with the camera angle will make you dizzy, headaches and even sick, that is very awfully one of parts.Second worst is vulgar stories, boring task and  you even can't use your bullet headshot the enemy. If you really love the Borderlands, you may feel this game copied Borderlands.So I suggest you don't have too much expectations with this, although metascore give it a high score of 79 points.P.S. The multiplayer almost entirely dead.5/10			"

												Pretty good FPS. Great mechanics and graphics. Ending could have been better as far as the ""boss fight"" goes.One day, you wake up from your capsule and saved by a local from the bandits. You make your way through the main quest, which is mostly linear, by travelling with various vehicles. The game has fantastic gameplay, graphics, and a decent story. The ending was largely disappointing though. I knew that the final mission was the final mission, but the ending was still very sudden and not as difficult as other ""boss"" fights. I mean, at one point, you fight a giant monster with just rocket launchers and only have a small room to navigate through, while the giant monster is outisde a gaping hole in the wall. The game certainly has its ""wow"" moments, and there are neat side things to do, like racing and delivery quests, but the main story could have used a little bit of work.The setting is fantastic though, the world design is great for the coloring and character. It's semi open world, as in you could explore the every corner, but the main missions are the priority. After a while, you go to a different area and you can tell how vastly destroyed and different it is in the color pallets, it's clear that id games put a lot of work in the design.8.9/10			"

												This is a spoilerfree review of the entire game played in singeplayer at pretty much 100% on normal difficulty. This was fun, there is many titles out there that do many things better, but this still was a nice enough game. The post-apocalyptic setting justifies for some mindless shoot people action. The game would have been a lot better as a cover-based shooter. The way it is you basically guess if cover is high enough not to get shot. The quests arent very memorable. Its pretty muh always ""shoot enemy type x do thing a come back"" While the characters did have a lot of personality none of them where very memorable. There is a small variety of minigames and sidestuff to do, play a cardgame, make cool jumps, participate in a race, allthough that one can become important since you get to most places via car and races are pretty much the only way to earn points to upgrade your car.  The weapons arent anything special either. Shotgun, crossbow, 2 types of machinegun, pistol (seriously who uses that thing once you get the other qeapons?) sniper rifle, rocket launcher and later minigun, some of them with multple types of ammunition. What it boils down to though is that you either use the shotgun or the sniper rifle. The only reason to not use the sniper rifle is if melee enemys are rushing towards you. Seriously, why bother with rocketlaunchers when a few good sniper shoots to the head kill any boss just as well? The crossbow is for a stealth approach in theory, but this suffers from 2 problems: Half of the time the enemies are already waiting for you and later on in the game the crossbow doesnt oneshot anymore, therefor rendering it useless for stealth. You can also craft some cool items, like an explosive RC car, a spiderlike killer robot (just like the sniper you need not bother with anything else once it is upgraded) and others. The races are all managable but require multiple tries sometimes. The story itself is nothing you havent seen or heard of before and mainly serves to connect one place you shoot people at with other places you shoot people at. The soundtrack gets the job done, particularly since its drowned in gunfire half the time anyway. The only soundtrack that stands out is the credit song (that I think is also the theme song? I dont know I always started the game before it had a chance to start playing)There are two main weaknesses: 1: a lack of maps. Half the time a map would have been really really helpful. Particularly in areas like the city where it at least took me a while to finally figure out where everything was leading to frustrated running in circles. The missions themself are so linear and leave so little room for exploration that a missing map usually isnt a problem though. 2; That ending. As I said spoilerfree so here is the main problem: There is a huge buildup. You get the freaking minigun and the special ""BFG-Ammo"" with it. Sounds like a hell of a fight doesnt it? I even used up all the money I had left on ammo and bandages (health potions). What actually happens is that you gun done a couple of goons and boom done. Not even a boss. I dont even know what the BFG ammo looks like because I saved it up for something epic. Im not even saying that I think the story should have gone on more, just a boss even if its a little one, would have been very nice. The goons you gun down arent even all that hard to beat, I used a total of 1 bandage. The game had many harder sections than this.Still I recomend this game. Why? Because its fun. It is fun running face to face towards the enemy and pumping a shotgun round in their heads to watch them flying. It is fun picking them off one by one with the sniper. It is fun running around wreaking havoc in your car. At least it is to me. I dont think this game should have been much longer though because the fighting is growing rather stale over time.			"

												===Note: The Steam Review Police are trying to keep me down and limit my text, so like half of this review is in the comments===4 years ago, I purchased RAGE. It was $30, and this was back when a game dropping to $30 within the year of its release was a deal of a lifetime and not an everyday occurrence on GMG, so I thought it was a great deal. I had heard the horror stories of its launch regarding things like ATI and general pop-in issues, but I figured enough time had passed that those bugs had been worked out. And they had, for the most part, but that wasn't why RAGE became one of my most regretted purchases on Steam. But instead of reviewing the game as I remember it, I decided to replay it just to articulate everything that I found wrong with RAGE.First off, if you have two or more monitors and your primary isn't on the left, RAGE is going to default to try launching on your left monitor. It doesn't matter how big or small it is, or if it's set as your primary monitor (which is what most sensible games launch to); it's going to make it fit until you get in and tell it not to. The engine is also locked at 60 FPS, so if you're like me and have a nice 144 hz monitor and want to get the most of it then you should go somewhere else. But enough technical nitpicking - what about the game?Well first off, I should mention the graphics, because it's obligatory that whenever someone mentions RAGE they have to talk about the graphics because that's the only memorable thing in this game. I could sit here and laugh at how bad the texture pop-in is, or how low resolution the textures are for hours, but I actually can't because I hit the text limit that I didn't know steam reviews had, so instead I'm just going to just leave you these videos I recorded throughout the last few days, and screenshots to accompany them, so you can laugh at them yourself. Just let me know when you're done so I can continue - they're compressed to 720p, but they still demonstrate the effects enough. These are all recorded and screenshotted on a GTX 970 with an i5 3570k overclocked to 4.4 GHz.http://puu.sh/jvyNH/9ed9b1eb9f.mp4http://puu.sh/jvOqm/6589f38244.mp4

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=499374777http://imgur.com/a/Qmc3xSee, the thing about RAGE's graphics is that they look great when you're outside, but the game's interiors pretty much universally look like garbage from a game from 2004. Of particular note is that the game has no dynamic lighting that I could see, so instead of giving you a flashlight or something they just made all the darkness the color green, which just makes it look even uglier. Thankfully, this also has the unexpected side effect of making the pop-in not very noticeable, because even if the textures haven't popped in at all you won't be able to tell if it's using placeholders or if that's just how the game looks. What you will notice, however, is how barren the world feels. The items that can be picked up have a noticeable contrast in texture quality with the rest of the world, and since RAGE is a game where you're expected to search every nook and cranny to find said objects, there's no excuse for said nooks and crannies to look so completely awful. Nothing else in any given level can generally be interacted with - you can't break bottles, you can't push chairs, you get the idea; it feels like the entire map is just one big model that you're moving through, and combined with the total lack of any dynamic lighting it makes the interior environments feel extremely dull. Oh, but what's that you say? You want to know about the wasteland itself? The one you've seen so many beautiful scenic screenshots about? Well, the problem is that those are just that - they're scenic wastelands that you drive through, take a screenshot of, and drive past. And that's a good thing, because even if you're outside and you get too close to a rock, or look down, the graphics just don't hold up. Now, regarding the pop-in demonstrated above there is a config that you can put in your launch options to remove it (supposedly, that is - I didn't try it, since I wanted the ""full RAGE experience""). The catch? It requires a GPU with at least 3 GB of VRAM. For a game in 2011, this is unacceptable. For a game that looks like it was made in 2004, this is laughable. But with all that, the graphics aren't even the real flaw of RAGE. As I said before, the interiors of the game are generally extremely ugly and bland. But while you might think that doesn't matter because of how much you've heard about the wasteland, the fact is that about 80% of the game takes place in those ugly interiors. For all you've heard about the wasteland overworld, it's essentially one big kodak moment, made for you to take a screenshot of on your way to the next interior. The wasteland is essentially just a big race track from one place to another, and you'll notice that feeling if you decide to play it. RAGE, despite its appearance, is an extremely linear game. Every  area in the game is either blocked off or locked until it's time to go there in a story mission, and half the time once you finish in said area, it locks off again, meaning there's plenty of missable content to be had because that's what gamers want in modern games. They don't even do a particularly good job of blocking the areas off - sometimes paths are just obstructed by almost waist-high blockades that you just can't jump over. Like these.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=497667786http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=497667076Furthering the linearity is that you aren't allowed to pick up weapons from the ground until you're at the point where you're ""supposed"" to obtain a particular weapon, even if it's a weapon that you do find later on. I can understand why we can't pick up a fallen enemy's assault rifle which is visually different from any of the ones you obtain. I can't understand why I can't pick up this shotgun, which was lying beside the person I killed.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=497668166Except while I don't understand it, I do know exactly why I couldn't pick it up - it was because that person was in the area where I was doing a side quest that was all but forced into my hands. The reward for the quest in question was a combat shotgun - not that exact combat shotgun, but the same combat shotgun, except it was blessed with the almighty quest reward status. That's the extent of the linearity of this game.So what about the actual levels, then? What are they like? Well, for the most part they're pretty much just the winding linear corridors you would expect from a standard-fare FPS. There are little bits and bobs that you can pick up to craft doodads and then immediately forget about, and every now and then there will be a neat secret that references Wolfenstein or Quake or something else to remind you that you could be playing a game where you can actually have fun right now. Each level involves running to the other end, grabbing the thing that the person who gave you the quest wanted you to grab, and then leaving through the new convenient exit that wasn't accessible from the beginning. Then if you're feeling really dangerous, you can go to the ""sidequest board"" and get a ""sidequest"", which basically involves going back through that exit, going back through the same level backwards, and grabbing another thing for some other person. One or two of the ""sidequests"" are particularly risky and try to break the mold and put you in a little cage and have you snipe mutants while defending a bunch of idiots. ===CONTINUED IN THE COMMENTS===			"

												The game is quite scenic and has a lot of character. The NPCs are interesting. Combat, economy, side quests, etc. all good. I made it as far as Wellspring, where I needed to get guns for my buggy to continue the storyline, and getting guns required me to win races with said buggy. This is where I hit a wall, literally and figuratively. The driving pretty much put an end to the game for me. At first with the keyboard, I did pretty well with the ATV, but the buggy was absolute crap. I tried my Logitech joystick, which has given me many hours of driving enjoyment... well, I had to use joy2key to make it work. And, again, driving the buggy was crap. I spent as much time in reverse to extricate myself from an obstacle as I did in forward. So I pulled out a controller. Again, driving the buggy was just not driving well (slightly better than the joystick). Additionally, the controller is just not comfortable because I haven't really used one much since the Atari 2600 days.			"

There's also a multiplayer racing mode that I haven't yet checked out.The vehicle sections and minigames are good diversions, and it's nice to see some of the stock weapons enhanced through upgrades.It's just a shame that the last third of the game feels comparatively unfinished and the finale seems to be missing.

												This game is smooth, which is as it should be with any game coming from Carmack. I was very impressed with the game's technical execution, BUT the substance of the game is lacking, unfortunately. At the time of my playthrough, I believe I had already played tons of hours in Borderlands, which I had also already beaten, so it really felt like a clone of that experience. RAGE definitely has more in-your-face moments than the aforementioned game, which I would characterize as one of the main drawbacks of Borderlands seeing as I could defeat just about any outpost by utilizing ranged (sniping) tactics. RAGE, on the other hand,has more realistic graphics, which comes as a plus basically because there were more visual ""WOW"" moments over BL. But at the gameplay level, which boils down to movement and shooting accuracy, the two games are virtually identical. Also, I completed RAGE much quicker then BL, why I'm not entirely sure.. maybe because I was used to the gameplay style via BL, or maybe it was somewhat less challenging seeing that most of the encounters were close-up, trying to surprise me -- which was a lesson previously taught by Doom 3 by the way. Overall, I would have to not recommend this game if you have played Borderlands, which came out before this, so...y'know. Otherwise, I give it my full recommendation.			"

												Rage is a game from Id Software, one of the most iconic game developers of all time; Id is responsible for classics like Doom, Wolfenstein and Quake, and are a household name amongst the gaming community. Rage was pretty highly anticipated before its release, and the game itself created a pretty divisive fanbase.Rage is set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland as a result of a meteorite collision with Earth. This makes for an environment made up of rocky canyons, dusty valleys and dark caves. This setting has been done quite a few times before, but the various gameplay mechanics and impressive use of visuals means that the world is rather nice to explore.You navigate a moderately open world, similar to the first Borderlands. Using a wide array of guns with various ammo types, you'll collect quests from a hub, find the location in the world, complete the quest; rinse and repeat. The missions don't really have much variety as you'll often be completing the same tasks, consisting of killing mutants and bandits to get some item or pickup. Despite this however, the game will make up for it with some surprisingly solid shooting, and enjoyable racing mechanics.The variety of guns definitely works in the game's favour. There are revolvers, assault rifles, shotguns, bazookas, plasma rifles, wingsticks, remote-control bomb cars, grenades, crossbows and sniper rifles. Not many games give you this many guns and I commend the game for doing so. The shooting itself is quite tight and responsive, with all of the weapons handling quite well. Enemy AI is also rather excellent; the enemies leap and sidestep around the levels to avoid your attacks, and it made the shooting really enjoyable and entertaining.The game's best asset is probably the racing. With different tracks and game modes, Rage allows you to use modified racing cars to face off against other foes from around the wasteland. You can upgrade your cars with missles and machine guns, and this made for genuinely interesting moments of the game. The 'Mad Max' feel the game was obviously aiming for was really noticed her, and was one of the more addictive/memorable parts of the game.Rage is a fun experience due to the sharp visuals, polished shooting and awesome racing. With little to no story and unmemorable characters, it is difficult to get invested in this game. If you enjoy mindless shooting and racing with visual flair, Rage will probably satisfy you. 7 / 10 "

												I waited all this time to pick up this game and finally played it. I have not yet finished it but so far so good. The game may be a few years old now but it still holds up. The graphics are a mix of really good and some what bad. The characters look really great yet some textures around the world look blurry and just bad. The combat feels great and natural but this is from the masters of the shooter after all. The game feels like a mix between Fallout, Borderlands and any ID shooter like Quake or Doom so all in all I would say check it out.			"

												I was actually in rage when this game came out. It was full of glitches and id software released a game with barely any graphics options to choose from in the main menu. Websites popped-up around the net to provide advice as to how to change the graphics settings by modifying the game's cfg file. I hated this - this was not user friendly and also even to check small changes you needed to quit and relaunch the game again and again.After a while some patches were released and corrected these issues of the game. RAGE, by the way, has a very mediocre story and in my opinion Bethesda being the publisher here did not help the case. You are a survivor after an asteroid almost completely annihilates mankind. Just before the catastrophe a handful of people - scientists, soldiers and other high rank personnel - were frozen and put in a so-called ark that was taken below ground levels. Many years after the event you wake up as your ark automatically hits the surface. You realise everybody else from your team perished and you are the sole survivor. You are immediately attacked by mutants and then saved by a stranger. He takes you to his settlement and the game practically starts.There are several small towns where you can interact with a lot of people. There are dozens of side missions to complete and a couple of minigames, as well. So, as opposed to what we got used to in previous id software games RAGE now follows a non-linear path. Completing sidemissions earns you money which you can use to purchase new weapons or upgrades to your equipment. In addition to this there are races you can participate in. You have your own vehicle and beside the races you can use this to go from one town to the next. I liked how smoothly the developers completed this - transitioning from the FPS perspective to the camera-behind-the-car view happens smoothly. There are really no loading times; getting in and out of your vehicle happens fast.There are two things where RAGE shines, in my opinion:1) Art design: Some of the places you venture through look amazing. An example: You need to go to Dead City to acquire an object. You climb narrow steps in-between huge, collapsed multistorey buildings. You truly get the feeling of a post-apocalyptic setting here. You race in vast wastelands, go down to the sewers to eradicate mutants, participate in a mutant reality show, go through deadly caves in the Scorchers DLC etc. Textures could have been more of high quality nature, still, the game's art design compensates for this.2) Combat: I loved Doom and Quake for their weapons. And how good it was to eliminate waves of enemies. RAGE delivers the very same experience. Enemies hide behind cover and they react realistically: headshots do count and in case you shoot them in the leg they stumble and fall. Some run at you with clubs only and you think it is easy to get rid of them but you realise that you cannot hit them: they do somersault and jump on and off walls and drive you mad. Also, all weapons are valuable. Remember how quickly we stopped using a pistol in Doom? As the minigun used the same ammunition. Or simply because weapons obtained later on were more efficient. In RAGE each weapon has different ammunition types and some upgrades, as well. Believe it or not - the pistol is one of the strongest weapons in the hands of a good shooter. You can craft a very strong bullet that can easily eliminate bigger foes with some good aimed headshots.RAGE can remind gamers of old-school shooters. If you look at it like that you can enjoy this game from start to finish. I am not saying my expectations weren't higher for an id game but following my initial disappointment I gradually came to like this game. Although the story is mediocre and the game has a disappointing end and a short DLC, it is a highly recommended FPS game.			"

												Rage un juego que inesperadamente me ha sorprendido. Shooter, carreras, minijuegos de cartas, cuchillos, dados y el Bash TV concurso de televisión en donde tienes que ir superando hordas de mutantes. Un juego completo sin duda alguna.No consideraría el juego como ""mundo abierto"" por las barreras invisibles y por la facilidad del camino a seguir durante las misiones. La ambientación post-apocalíptica, los efectos de sonido, los movimientos de los enemigos, las armas y sus variantes como diferentes municiones, el robot araña, los coches teledirigidos, la sensación de como te va envolviendo el juego, todo esto ha cumplido con creces mis expectativas del juego. Y por decir algo negativo pues mencionar que la última misión y como ha terminado la campaña no ha sido del todo muy sorprendente pero bueno todo lo demás compensa.			"

												Solid shooter, though you deal a lot with bullet-sponge enemies, or enemies of the same variant. Interface is very poorly designed for a mouse and keyboard. Very little difficulty curve, and the game more or less just dumps a ton of upgrades on you without even trying.Driving is okay, but is limited mostly to races which get boring very quickly. All the upgrades aren't really necessary for survival.Completed first playthrough focusing on side-quests and got 10 hours out of it. Bought it for $20, and would not recommend purchasing for anything more than that. Felt like iD was going for a very broad, Borderlands-esque shooter with about 30 hours of content, but ran out of time and shortened it considerably. The game ends when you feel like it just gets going.			"

 Get the game when it's on sale.  Honestly, the game does an incredible job of hyping itself up, and then dropping you like a sack of bricks. I remember playing this on PS3 years ago, marvelling at the beautiful visuals and the somewhat-unique post apocalyptic aesthetic of Rage. Of course, I never got farther than the Dead City, or else I would never have purchased it here. The massive mutant boss fight was the most fun, exhilarating part of the game. The rest is just new types of small fry to shoot at. The game, however, has excellent gameplay and I had a lot of fun shooting em all up, but the weapon switching system was just so clunky.  And the saddest part about the whole game, for me at least, was the utter lack of a real relationship with Sarah. She just sits in the ""trophy room"" as a sort of superficial ""trophy"" after the scorchers and never returns to the outside world ever again. ""I don't want to go outside. I want to play video games with you!"" Seriously, ID? SERIOUSLY?? AND THE ENDING. ARGHH the ending.			"

												Rage an example of an amazing corridor FPS(its an 'open world' filled with corridors and the 'open world is another huge corridor linking all the smaller corridors together), it offers a very different experience of corridor shooters, by giving me the choice to continue on with the story or to hang around doing side missions and races, many other linear games does not have this feature, they make you go on without giving you a break, thats why I didn't get bored playing this game.This game is a shiny gem among other linear games, theres some great weapons to use, and I mean it, every single weapon is unique, and each has different ammo types to apply. The game even employs a decent crafting system, u can craft some items like meds to heal or bombs and stuff like that to kill your enemies with different styles. There are few types of enemy in this game, mainly u kill anything that moves, make use of your weapons, there is so many approach to killing besides shooting.The graphics are beautiful from far, it's like a painting come alive, but up close its terrible, its so blurry that u can compare it to the graphics of the 1st Half-Life game. The driving is a bit off, it just doesnt seem real, banging a wall at full speed and u get a little knock back and thats it. I must say the ending fight is kinda lame, I saved a lot of bullets for the boss fight I imagined would be tough, but instead its just dissapointingly easy, its the lamest ♥♥♥♥ I've ever seen, they decided to keep the story hanging there, so there will be a sequel to this. I just hope they improve everything, this game has lots of potential but not enough content.Overall I think that it's definitely worth your time and your money, get it on a sale			"

												Please note that this review is a little biased, since I bought the game on sale for 5$, and for 5$ it is a damn near perfect. But I will try to judge it if I got it full priced. Rage is pretty much a odd wannabee post apocalyptic middle child. It seems to have broken into the house of Fallout and Mad Max, but didn't have enough time and only managed to steal a few things. It got the vehicle combat done quite well, and the enviroments look very stunning, even playing in 2016. Though combat gets a bit repetitive at times, the game can't seem to decide if it wants to be a run and gun, or a ""next gen"" cover based shooter. Though the guns feel new and fresh, it seems every enemy has a copious amount of health. But even through that, I played on the highest difficulty and only died twice thoughout my entire playthough, once when I got bombarted by 3 rocket launcher dudes, and once when I tested to see if you could exit your car mid jump. Unfortunately when Rage broke into Fallout's house it forgot to take the open world aspect, maybe its sneak wasnt high enough. Also if you buy this game, don't buy it for the plot, the plot is basically a really bad chinese knock off, diet, watered down version of Fallout 3. But buy it for being Mad Max with rocket lauchers strapped to your car. All together for 5$- 8/10Full priced- maybe 6/10Final note: you may of encountered spelling mistakes and gammaical errors in my review, I could say that english is not my frst language, but it is. I really couldnt give a Mel Gibson about it.  Final final note: I do have a bone to pick with the pick up noise. Every time you pick up a collectiable it makes the sound of gun cocking, and every single time I think there is a baddie behind me. I guess thats what cs does to you.			"

												Rage is an odd game.Don't get me wrong, it's pretty darned fun, but it feels unfinished, which is uncharacteristic of id.It looks gorgeous from a distance, but up close, the megatexture technology displays its weakness and ends up making every texture in the game look muddy.There's still that odd moment when turning where the engine takes a microsecond longer to render textures in your peripheral vision.For a world that invites exploration, it's remarkably linear, even down to your character not being able to jump over knee-high obstacles.And the abrupt ending is one of the worst in gaming.Still, the shooting and movement possess that unique id solidity, even down to strafe-jumping working like it does in Q3. And the character models and animation are sublime.			"

												  RAGE is a unique experience in the post-apocolyptic genre. It's got gunfights! It's got scaveging/crafting!  It's got... Racing!  What it is, foremost, is a fast-paced FPS, and it does this quite well with a wide selection of weapons and enemies that make you work to put them down.  After the introduction you are left to explore or thrust yourself into the first quest.    ""But I thought you said this is a FPS!""  It is, the story is driven in a nonlinear-linear fashion.  Which I thought was a brilliant way to let me decide how I want to play the game.  When I'm not busy running for cover, deciding what weapon (of which there is a plethora of options if you take into consideration the different ammos available for wach gun) would be most effective in the current combat situation, or scavenging for items, I found myself appreciating the the work put into making each location truely unique and beautiful.  It was refreshing to be emmersed in a post-apocolyptic world that is desolate, and at the same time rich in color.  It's too bad that there are inconsistances that broke me out of the trance:      For some reason random areas of both the world and level maps would just not be accessable due to some invisible barrier.  ""Why can I jump on top of this flaming trashcan but not the the short stack of tires right next to it!""    Found myself in the heat of a firefight and taking cover to change to a certain weapon/ammo selection.  The act of getting to the right type of ammo or crafting a few things would sometimes take longer then the battle.  ""Let's take a five mutants/raiders/authority soldiers!  I'm not ready yet!""  Overall I found the game very fun and emmersive.  I suggest waiting for the game to go on sale to buy though.  It's a blast, but not $20 worth of fun.			"

												There is a lot to like about this game.  A nice, vibrant post-apocalyptic world, even if it does have weird western and steampunk elements, nice guns that all feel different to use, have great animations and sounds.  The crafting system is simple, not tedius.  And the driving was just enough, not too much especially for someone who prefers shooters over drivers, so this didn't wear on me, which was nice.The basic plotline of a survivor of a near ELE brought awakening into a nightmarish world years after being put into cryo sleep is not unique, but works well enough.  The first part of the game is just doing odd jobs to get things.  Most of those odd jobs involve brutal murder, but hey, it's the world you're in, right?  Unfortunately, the plot is purely driven by the NPC's in the same mold as the Half-Life series, you never utter a single word, there are no cut scenes to drive plot.  So, effectively you have to take the word of these people you just met, that murdering 100s of people is the right thing to do.  Of course, everyone shoots on sight.  But when strangers are constantly conspiring to murder you, who wouldn't?The story goes down hill once The Resistance is brought into it.  Yes, another story with a Resistance, which is fighting against an evil, oppresive and technologically superior supressor power.  This trope is so over used, that it has lost all meaning.  What starts as an interesting survival in the post-apocalyptic wasteland soon becomes the same as every other resistance storyline ever done.  And whilst the gameplay is fun, the story lacks immersion and anything that you'll remember a day after completion.There is no explanation given as to how, in such a desloate landscape, such technology is freely available to the bad guys.  It just is.  There are some nice moments of horror in the game, going through Dead City especially.  Some good FPS battles, and each of the enemy types you come up against does have some nice and unique feel to them.  Mutants, the different bandit tribes, the Authority, The Gearheads etc.  They all look, fight and feel authentic, meaning that even though there is a lot of shoot XYZ, the combat never seems to drag.  It's rare that you end up fighting the same kind of foe more than 1 or 2 missions in a row.Ultimately, i thoroughly enjoyed this game, and even though i got it on special, i'd have been happy to pay full price.4/5			"

												I recommend this game...but barely. I actually sort of got interested into trying it after playing through The New Order earlier this year, even though the games don't have a lot in common other than their engine...which most people don't care for. Anyways, figured I'd give one of id's only ""recent"" games a try. Rage doesn't know what it wants to be. I guess that's a common criticism so I'm not breaking new ground here. At a surface level, it looks reminiscent of Fallout 3, with a similar setting and even a rudimentary quest structure. However, this game is clearly an FPS and not an RPG. It also has vehicle traversal, even including racing and time trials. This wasn't what I was looking for going in, so outside of using the vehicles to go from objective to objective, it wasn't something I put a lot of time into. So I pretty much played this as a straight FPS, to the extent I could. I was instantly soured at the layout of the game. You are fairly readily given the ability to explore the Wasteland, which while not a sprawling overworld that you can really get lost in, it does have some size to it and I was happy to be able to simply roam around, look for enemies, get off and find places my vehicle couldn't go. It at first seemed like I had a fair bit of agency to do what I wanted. I found a little nook with a few enemies, eventually I found a body with a piece of clothing marked ""Juno"". How interesting. I then found a one-way shortcut to a radio tower of sorts that I couldn't get to before. ""Oh, this is how to get here..."" but I couldn't do anything. Later I go into an encampment and I'm told that I need to find out what happened to Juno, and also that I need to press a button on the tower or whatever. That's Rage. It's not the best setup.Rage is all about being told where to go, and after this first anecdote, I was never in a hurry to explore past where I was told to since having to revisit the area once under orders just seemed like no fun at all. So instantly, the game goes from initially coming across like a fairly open environment to one where you're shackled to where whatever the npcs want you to do. This isn't bad in itself, since many shooters are linear without much choice in direction, but it certainly makes beelining across the Wasteland on the the buggy following the objective dot to be far less engaging. To make matters worse, many of the game's sidequests, conveniently stashed onto a conspicuous notice board, just require you to revisit mission areas, and maybe traverse them backwards with a swapped enemy set. It's a little uninspired. There are a few sidequests that require you to converse with town npcs, but most come from the boards, which I've never really enjoyed that set up.The game performs well, outside of the infamous texture pop issue of the engine. I thought I was prepared after having played TNO but it's significantly worse here. Luckily the pc gaming wiki was able to provide a near-fix, but those first few minutes of getting out of the Arc were certainly an eyesore. The raw gameplay is solid, I love being about to hold all of the weapon types. The game starts out fairly modest with a pistol, a machine gun, a shotgun, grenades, etc. After 5 hours though you're given multiple weapon types with multiple ammo configurations, and even quick use items ranging from emp grenades to boomerang blade and rc cars. There's lot of options, and I found myself willing to change up my loadout just to get a feel for everything. The quick menu configuration I thought was a little clumsy, with having to access the f1-f4 keys and having all of the various items just be mapped to a single button. Changing weapons and ammo, however, felt very natural. There were also a fair variety of enemy types the made different weapon usage quite the necessity (even on normal mode). Mutants that charge you straight on were better taken out with the shotgun and quickblades, while gearheads and more typical enemy soldiers would be better engaged with scoped weapons or grenades. Throw in the later game enemies with armor and shields and it was never really boring until...the end. The ending is supremely lame. I suppose look it up if you haven't played it.The story is forgettable. You're just fetching stuff half the time. All in all, the game is enjoyable once you get a texture pop fix and get over the rather lame quest structure and mini games and racing, And deliveries and sidequests. So yeah, a lot of fat that could have been trimmed. I think the game could have been a lot more polished if it had a focused goal. I suppose that's a bit tautological but I guess I see this game as being pretty exemplary of having unneeded side systems. I thought the crafting items were interesting enough, even if I mostly made the ammo and lock grinders and grenades and ignored the various boosts and bandages. The gambling games and various money sinks like trading cards, however, just seemed unneeded. Luckily that gave me more dispoable income to just try out various ammo types and build crafting items I normally wouldn't have tried. It also meant I didn't have to put a lot of effort into money-gathering events like deliveries and the monster tv segments. I just wanted to shoot stuff, you know?			"

												9/10 - no rage quitting here, you'll probably play this in one goRAGE is the reason I like the STEAM free weekends, because otherwise I would have never played and eventually bought this underrated jewel of a game.It's a mix of post-apocalyptic FPS, car wars and CCG (yeah thats right, RAGE includes an in-game collectible card game thats as fun as addictive). And on top you get to craft all kinds of useful stuff.Took me 40 hours to finish but I'm a slow player and had both the Scorcher and Sewers DLCs. An average player will probably spend about 15-20 hours on the base game and 30 tops on the whole package.++PROS+++ World design, characters design, weapons design, everything is original and great looking+ Engaging firefights in extremly varied locations where tactics count and cover is important(!)+ An AI that lives up to its name, from mutants running on the ceiling to soldiers throwing grenades to get you out of cover+ Original weapons like razor-boomerangs (that do return!) or RC bomb cars+ An ingame trading card game where you have to find/buy/kill for cards you use to construct decks which you play against NPCs for cash+ Car races&fights that are just complex enough to be fun but simple enough to enjoy even playing with mouse/kb+ A crafting system that has you hunt for scraps and recipes to craftt everything from ammo to small robots.+ Conversations are mostly voice acted and human(oid) enemies do a lot of trash talk during fights. VO quality is good and even the music is mostly enjoyable.--CONS--- Too less of everything. Places, npcs, quests, weapons, vehicles....had the game triple it's size, it could have become a contender for FO- Not exactly railroaded but far from open world, regions have to be unlocked and the longer the game goes the more often you drive along the same routes over and over again- The story starts out very good but somewhere in the last quarter it looses grip and logic and the ""end"" feels rushed and unfinished- Some boss fights can hardly be won by intuition, you will have to google the tactics once or twice- An autosave system you will have to get used to (it's not unfair though)If you decide to give RAGE a try, get the DLCs from the start - imo they are not much fun to play after the base game's end.

												Get this game,it's one of modern greats up there with DOOM,Quake and Wolfenstein.Having played The New Order (we're talking about id tech 5,2014) it couldn't hold a candle to RAGE's gunplay.Many people will say that RAGE is boring/flawed etc. but they are just spoiled and prefer extensive storylines over gameplay.RAGE's gunplay is hands down the best in a modern shooter and the car combat is very well implented.If you don't like the fetch quests and car combat after a complete playthrough you can play  ALL the combat sections on the Combat Scenario mode minus the travelling.Also,The Scorchers DLC is definitely worth it's money and will only do to add to your experience.All in all this game is criminally underrated and you should play it if you think of yourself as an FPS fan.P.S. After your first playthrough experiment with the console to get the most out of this game			"

												It would be a competent but forgettable shooter, but as much as I wanted to like RAGE, the id Tech 5 engine is atrocious.  Wolfenstein had many of these problems, but MachineGames did their best to utilize its strengths and cover its weaknesses.  Here, we get to see just how terrible the engine really is.As far as the game itself goes, it's your generic old-school/new-school mash-up game.  The gunplay is still satisfying, as you'd damn well expect from id, but there's just some clunkiness to it I can't put my finger on.  I suspect this also has to do with the engine, as when it isn't microstuttering and streaming 128x128 textures two feet away from me, I start enjoying it again.  I'm not even a graphics snob either, and it still gets to me with just how jarring and distracting the pop-in problems are.The game puts you in a post-apocalyptic world, where bandits are everywhere and you go around doing quests for different people.  You can also get some vehicles along the way, and carry four weapons at a time.  Sound familiar?  Correct, this game hits pretty close to Borderlands in its gameplay.  Sadly, Borderlands takes what it does and does it well, while RAGE focuses more on its slightly-decent gunplay, so it's more of a ""Borderline"" than anything.Let me go out and say, I f@#king hate the car physics.  They're just awful.  You've got turbo and a single handbrake that's way too efficient.  Your car is pretty much glued to the floor, the smallest pebble can stop your car altogether, and moving fast with boost only exaggerates the problems I stated before with pop-in.  I dread any and all cars in this game.On an Nvidia card, the game will be slightly more playable with GPU Transcode as a feature.  However, since they cashed out to Nvidia and decided AMD users (even with their own CUDA, ""Stream"") weren't worthy of a playable game, fellow AMD owners should avoid this steaming pile of sellout ♥♥♥♥ like the plague.  Even if you own an Nvidia card, the unoriginal story and only-decent gunplay still isn't worth full price.  id, I'm seriously disappointed.  How such a legendary studio could come up with an end result like this is honestly pathetic.  I'm sorry to say this, but RAGE is my first victim of the almighty Steam Refund.Also, a little texture compression would be nice.  If you're not even going to have these full textures appear in-game half the time, why do they need to take up 30GB I could be using for games with actual effort put into them?			"

												RAGE. What an approriate title. It's all I feel when I play this awful game.This is easily id software's worst game. I played on normal difficulty and it gets super hard for no reason at all. The weapons and shooting are terrible, which is a massive surprise since these guys made DOOM and Quake. The game looks pretty I guess but you can't see anything in dark areas, especially when being shot at by enemies. The enemies in this game take an eternity to go down, but they can kill you with only a few super accurate shots and it's stupid.Just skip this one. "

												A mixed bag.  What would have been state of the art in 2006 was dated and poorly designed on arrival in 2011 and is postivly archaic in today's market, but there is a charm to the mostly linear experience that is a hallmark of id software games.  The levels are interestingly laid out and look stunning from a distance, but the appalling ""Megatexture"" technology which just wasn't worth the time of day, and lazy placement of objects that feel very clearly placed to cheat you out of exploration do end up frustrating you a lot of the time.The first half of the game feels like it's building up to something interesting, but what feels like a severely truncated second half feels uneven, bland and much weaker than the first half.  Missed opportunities in the story, gameplay and design make this an overall failure, but one that for a few quid, is enjoyable enough to warrant playing through.			"

This game is a good CASUAL console action game, but dont consider it as a FPS. Its not. You CAN'T even JUMP properly on a bench.

What is rage, you may ask?  Let me answer that question of yours.The game is set in a post-apocalyptic future, where the civilization as we know it, has been destroyed by the asteroid 99942 Apophis in 2029. Survivors have created settlements and other habitable locations and have been divided into various clans and organizations of their own. Bandits and mutants constantly roam the world and try to salvage and destroy the settlements.The story is your basic, “save the world story”. I could not get into the story of this game, it did not draw me in with anything special. I found no connections to the players actions except saving the world, but you are not greeted with an explanation to why the protagonist do the things he does. The protagonist is a mystery, who just happens to emerge and wants to save the world. I guess that you do not need more information to why you save the world, but it is a detail I would like to see, as to why the protagonist to the choices he does.The protagonist, is an “Ark Survivor”. You emerge to the surface as the sole survivor from your Ark in 2135, and you are immediately thrown into the harsh world that is left. You are greeted by some bandits trying to salvage the wreckage of your ark, you are in an bad position as you lack weapons and equipment, but fear not because you are saved by a wasteland settler, who will teach you how the new world works. From here on it follows a linear story, where you do quest after quest which takes you further up in the world, and soon people will start to hear rumors of the “Ark Survivor”, and form here on the journey only gets harder as you try to save the world from its misery.It is not that I disliked the story itself, I just could not find myself caught in it. I just followed the quest, did what I was told, and not long into the game I started to forget the story itself. But fear not, the story may have been weak for me but there were many other things that weighted in for it.The gameplay itself is what lured me into this game, this is what kept me coming back to the game. It is very action based, with a lot of gun-play, and a few stealth mechanisms if you manage to pull them off.This action is where all the fun resides. You can find yourself stuck waist-down in a firefight, with grenades flying from both sides, until you emerge victorious or die trying. But you do not actually die, since the Ark suit that you wear through the game has a built in defibrillator, so when you are about to die you enter a second chance mode, where you can revive yourself with a percentage of health and take out the enemies around you.I found that the AI was very good, and they have some of the more interesting mechanics, comparing with other games. Bandits dodge your shoots by doing acrobats, tactically advance and fall back depending on their amount, their health and how much health I seem to have. Mutants however swarm the area around you and charge head in, towards you, and jumps around to confuse you.There are not so many different enemies. There are three main categories, Bandits, Mutants and Authority. Each of the three has a number of different subcategories, where you find a handful of changes like, different weapons and different armor, changes in movement and size. Sure there are only three main enemies, but with the subcategories and all the changes in between the enemies, you get a very dynamic feel towards what you are fighting. There are some bosses in the game, which are a nice asset. One is the huge of a ten story apartment and takes some time taking down until you learn the tricks, and another might just be a bandit in some bulky armor shooting rockets at you. I found the bosses to be a nice change from the regular creeps that are sent at you, and they offered a nice amount of challenge, to keep it hard and interesting.The enemies had some changes with weapons, but what do you get?  You get an arsenal of ten weapons if I am correct. At first I thought that this was not enough, that it became to repetitive running about with the weapons you had, but all of that changes soon enough, when I was introduced to different kinds of ammo and equipment. Some weapons got explosive ammo, some got electric, some even got mind-control ammo. There was so many joyful ways to take down your enemies that I had a hard time choosing which was my favorite. The game rewarded you with different types of equipment, your primary were regular grenades, but you also had EMP-grenades, wingsticks (A triple-bladed boomerang), RC cars and some other things that I did not pay so much attention to.There was a nice amount of side quests that you could do, from eliminate, protect, save, gather, races and delivery missions. They offered a nice variation to the linear and dull story, but there was one thing that blew away all of the side missions and that was BashTV, and arena where you could fight through some of the weirdest, immerse, amusing and engaging rooms filled with mutants of all sorts. I spent a lot of time in this arena, rampaging about with my weapons as I had to dodge enemies, spinning blades from the roof, spikes from the floor, you name it.A game cannot be perfect, while there was a lot of things that stimulated, but there were also some things were dull and for me destroyed the feeling of immersion. The first thing I have already mentioned, and that is the story. Then we have the world. From time to time the world appealed me, with how everything seemed to have adopted to the apocalyptic world, how the some areas felt unique. I found it to be way to empty from time to time, and I saw repeating patterns in how the enemy areas were made. There were no weather changes, which withdrew some of my immersion. I also felt like the textures on the environment were to low res from time to time, and badly made, compared to the weapons, characters and vehicles. I had some trouble with the rendering from time to time as well, seemed like the textures were not loading as they should. Other than the problem I had with the look of the textures and their rendering from time to time, the game looked good. It fitted the scene of an apocalyptic world as it was supposed to, sure there was the feeling of it being to empty at certain points, but what else is there to be expected from a game like this.The controls were completely fine, everything did as I wanted it to, when I wanted it. The only thing I disliked about controls was that the camera was locked when you were in a vehicle, I would have liked it to be move able so you could watch around more. but I managed to look past it and enjoy the game for what it was.The voices were well made, sometimes you got the feeling that some of the voices did not fit in at all, but it was quickly overlooked. The game had a nice soundtrack that kept the immersion in place, and made you feel like you were in the heat of the moment. Then we have the weapon sounds, I loved the sound of the weapons in this for some reason. To me they were very realistic, and the sound of someone blowing up or being electrocuted was amusing in so many ways, that it was close to disturbing.Conclusion:The game Rage, is a very fun game to play, if you are able to overlook the issues that I found. I enjoyed it once I overlooked the issues, and I played through the story in about 8-9 hours. For me this time was well spent, by blowing stuff to pieces, blasting them in the face with a shotgun or trying the stealthy approach with a crossbow. If you are a person that likes the action based games where it is a lot of shooting involved, and do not mind if the story is the weak part, f			"

												I feel this is a title that gets less attention than it deserves, so I figured Id farm up a steam task and do a lesser known game some due justice in the process...RAGE is a game developed by one of my favorite developers of all time: ID Software. Because of this, I have massive fanboy goggles on, and am aware of this fact, and now you are too. Keep this in mind, and so will I whilst writing this.My first impression when playing this game was extremely positive. The opening cinematic, while being incredibly simplistic, does wonders for this game's atmosphere and is just downright beautiful. You are placed into the game without being assaulted with exposition, and I like that, so long as I can get it at my own pace during play. Discovery is one my favorite aspects to any game. The Visuals in this game are fantastic, ID has always been ahead of the curve in the graphical department, and this game really had me drolling with its visi-porn. This game gave me a gamer erection right away, and it persisted for much longer than 4 hours. The meat of the gameplay consists of roaming what remains of civilization while both on foot and in a vehicle with the goal of surviving, learning about your own history, helping remaining survivors that want to help you, and obliterating everything that wants to eat you. Driving, shooting, and shooting while driving are what you do in this game: and those things are FUN. The gunplay is quite good because the weapons are fun, visceral, and ammo is customizable. Each meaningfully unique weapon has meaningfully unique ammo types, making it one of my favorite things about the entire game. Enemy AI being strong also helps make combat satisfying. Driving is fun because cars are customizable, badass looking, responsive, and responsible for lots of great vehicular manslaughter moments. I thought I would dislike the driving, as its main purpose is for what you'd thinks its for: going places. Thankfully, going places is actually fun, and it never takes a painful amount of time, even when you have kill people who get in your way when all you want to do is get to the mission location.Exploration in this game is done in a way unlike any Ive seen. The game is a linear game but manages to not feel like it, and rewards mucking around and looking behind buildings and rocks that you would never need go near in the first place. Random junk like wires and cans all have resale value, and some can even be used to make random gadgets and gizmos on the fly, most of which are there just so you can mess around with more ways to murderize your enemies. The 'Engineering' in this game doesnt feel like a way waste your time or gate your progress, it feels like something a wastes wanderer would actually do given his circumstances and is way more fun than something so mundane should even be. Making RC cars with bombs stuck on them to blow up enemies who arent aware of you is fun, and is just one of 1000 ways to kill your enemies. Enemy and location design is also very good. Some missions are much scarier than I thought they would be just because of the locale and enemies within. While everything has that ""crumbly, abused, neglected, dirty, or repurposed"" design that most post-apocolyptic games have, it still remains memorable to me even though its been awhile since ive played. Variation in the urban and natural areas keeps it not feeling all samey, at least most of the time. The story remains vague initially, which like I said before, is something I actually like. As you begin to discover and learn more and more, the game becomes truly engrossing, and had me invested fully, since it all felt as though I had discovered it, rather than it being rammed up my bum because I needed it to understand whats going on. Unfortunatley right during the biggest highs this game's story creates, the game ends unforgivably abrubtly. The sudden and supremely limp ending to the narrative and game as a whole is THE WORST IVE SEEN IN ANY GAME EVER. YES, EVEN WORSE THAN MASS EFFECT 3. Overall: The game succeeds at being a wasteland explorating, baddie smoking, vehicle smashing, scavenging and wrecking fun fest. I had a really great time with this one, and I recommend it to anybody who has liked any game where you pick up a gun and rearrange a guy's face with it. This game is very underrated and underplayed.GOOD:-GUN DESIGN-AMMO TYPES-VEHICULAR COMBAT/RACING-VISUAL QUALITY-ENGINEERING/SCAVENGING-ENEMY AI-F%$#ING STUFF UPACCEPTABLE:-ENEMY DESIGN-LEVEL DESIGN-NPCS-LORE-LEVEL NAVIGATIONBAD:-THE ENDING IS ATROCIOUS-A FEW SERIOUS BUGS			"

WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DO YOU HAVE A SAVING ICON USED ALSO FOR LOADING.you'll run into alot of first time developer problems like this.

												Do you wish your Fallout post-apocolyptic game was more like a linear corridor shooter?  Linear as they are, the levels are rich in visual flair.  The gunplay isn't overly technical and is polished as any other Quake or Doom game.  The gadgets are a nice way to make the combat alittle more different than the usual pop and shoot.  The weapons sound nice and beefy.  The cars handle well with a k/m.This game isn't bad at all.  Might be repetitive for some, might be engaging for others.  I enjoy it simply for the visuals.			"

												I bought this game the day it came out for xbox 360 (My PC was 100% linux at that point)I played it all the way through and while it felt a bit short I loved every minute of it.I've since upgraded my PC's GPU, dual booted windows, bought it on steam (with the DLC) and am playing through it again.I'm finding it just as enjoyable as the first time I played it and I would like to see more games like it in the future.In my opinion, too many games recently have tried to add far too much content and forgotten to add the fun.These games start to feel like a chore to play and you end up never finishing them. Of course there are exceptions but I have far too many games I will probably never finish because they got boring.Sure RAGE doesn't have the best graphics (although that painted sky is beautiful) nor does it have the greatest storyline, however, it's the kind of game that's genuinly fun to play.The mechanics are fun (I especially like the wingsticks and deployable turrets) and who doesn't like blowing up a mutant with an explosive projectile fired from a massive shotgun? The missions are all slightly different and (at least for me) the game never feels stale or lacking in content.Once you've finished the main storyline and the missions from the jobs board there are always the sewers to clear and now the scorchers DLC which, while quite short, I found to be increadibly entertaining.I get bored very easily and so there are very few games I have played all the way through, let alone gone back to for a second play though. Rage however is one I just can't get enough of.			"

												id Software, the inventors of the FPS genre, find themselves in a rough spot, these days. They leave the gameplay innovation to other developers. Doom 3 was already an 'old-school' retro game, when it came out. RAGE is a classic FPS in many ways. The weapons feel good. The enemies are popping up the same way as always. But the fidelity of the presentations is top notch. The animations are maybe the best you can find in new games & the levels are worth exploring, because id tried something new. They left the familiar ground and gave you loot and stuff to sell in shops. And they added a racing game in between the shooting levels, which is quite fun. You won't find pre-rendered textures. Instead, the lead programmer and mastermind John Carmack worked on his infamous ""Megatextures"", giving artists unprecedented freedoms to craft unique landscapes and levels without the usual restrictions. It's if 2D concept art would have come to life thx to virtual texturing. Worth seeing & playing, IMHO.			"

												RAGE is a beautifully crafted FPS with modern tweaks, which feels strange coming from the veteran of the genre. I don`t see ID trying to implement modern tweaks into their new games as a bad thing, atleast as long as they don`t over do it. RAGE is beautiful, has a powerful and satisfying array of weapons along with crafting unique items such as sentries and bots. The game is full of minigames, some fun and others just frustrating. The multiplayer could use some work, and the PC version could be tweaked a little more to satisfy long time ID fans. Not ID`s best work but is still pretty damn fun and entertaining.			"

All the mini games, races, fantastic environment, good story(very bad ending though) made me recommend this game. However; the game lacks RPG features badly, its kinda they made for FPS and then put some RPG in it afterwards. Therefore, if you like RPG based games u will be dissapointed.			"

												Synopsis: A post apocalyptic FPS, where you try to save the world from the evil government and wasteland bandits.Genre: FPSYea!: A large amount of unique weapons(as well as ammo types for each one) that each feel different, gunplay is a blast! Distance graphics are just beautiful.Meh!: Story is your run of the mill cookie cutter Post-apoc save the world story, length for a fps is just right. Texture quality is too wide in quality with either being awesome or just down right pathetic.Bleh! Game is full of technical issues, especially in the menu system with mouse sensitivity, unresolved AMD GPU crashes and the unability to skip cutscenes and character conversations is quite annoying.Lowdown: A good FPS when caught on sale cheap enough, but it shows its console development lead with some of the textures and objects in game. The menu sysstem can be fixed by putting mouse sensitivity in game to at least 50% but makes aiming to fast for me in game.3/5			"

												I can only comment on the single player campaign of the game and I did not buy the DLC 'The Scorchers'.- Game is from 2011 but graphics are fine in my eyes. Well, they are good enough that you also will notice that a lot of textures look low res when you come close, for me this was not a big problem, I had a very old display and system a few weeks ago. If you think a game like for example Skyrim looks bad then you may already be used to something different and please keep that in mind if you continue reading.I had very little texture popping after I found a fix for the issue on the net. Once I bumbed into an invisible car.- Music and sound effects are good too, music I often turn off because I like to concentrate on the effects and ambience but this music I listened to, it was quite fitting, situational and well done.- Difficulty: The game was so easy in the beginning that I switched to the highest difficulty early, you can do this without restarting. I have a tendency to slowly explore and hold my position in a single player FPS if that is possible, this and the fact that there is no gun swaying when you zoom in with certain weapons was the death sentence for a lot of the standard enemies in this game. There is recoil of course but you just need to be a little patient and use your cover. Enemies use grenades but you have the time to get away, they will yell 'use a frag' or something similar and then you know you soon need to retreat a bit, also grenades tick and the direction you need to avoid can be seen on screen once the grenade gets close. If enemies decide to leave cover and charge then you usually will hear about it too. Being patient also meant I did not need any healing besides the auto healing most of the time, the auto healing in this game especially means that scouting will not cost you anything in a lot of situations. Then there were agressive standard melee enemies, mixed sometimes with other enemies and this was a bit more challenging. But you may know what is the standard close combat weapon and it's powerful. The last mission again was a little more difficult but of course you also have the most powerful weapon then. For some reason I did not get myself to use self made rules, if you give Rage a try and are an experienced FPS player then maybe hurry sometimes though there often is no need, you could limit the amount of ammo for certain weapons per mission in the beginning at least, something like that. Later the game got a little more difficult but for me the highest setting was ok and I finished the game with a lot of unspent resources in my inventory.There was a side quest that was a challenge and there may be more side quests and/or races that are difficult, I did not play through all of them because side quests from the job boards often lead you back to an area you know already. And I am bad at race games, winning the easier races though was sufficient to be able to buy enough upgrades.- Characters look good and one in particular was done well enough to let me hope for some more story telling at a certain point, though I did not expect a story rich game. The tension after all did rise after that, there were 3 boss encounters, the atmosphere changed to be more threatening and a tougher fight. It's ok when a game has its climaxes and its weaker moments, the alternative can be boring.- Story: Do you know the line 'Skip that if you want.' ? It's the beginning of the 'story' of the first Doom iirc. The developers have come a long way, skipping text is required regularly now (joke). Seriously you should not try to skip the story completely although - to quote a line in the game - 'no one reads' in the world of Rage. Not going to spoil it, I just suggest we don't let it come to this. Though the game is not too short imo the story was almost over when I found the main purpose for a hero in the wasteland, from that perspective the game seems unfinished. Overall the story is very shallow.- Easy difficulty does not mean it is a game with weak level design, after exiting the wasteland everything is quite linear and some places indeed were a little boring but other locations were well done and there are a lot of scripted encounters. Actually 'scripted encounter' is just a category I'm used to, the 'standard AI behaviour' if something like that exists in this game separatly is not bad at all too. Enemies behind cover for example often are not stupid, you just are too powerful for them usually. Compared to what I am used to the AI has improved a little. But I also have to say the last mission is a letdown. It also is quite short..- Some of the buildings look like from a different planet, maybe they hired an architect tired by the restrictions of reality, nice.- No bugs besides the invisible car I think. Well, once two enemies looking at me did not shoot until I got very close which I 'had to do' because I guess sometimes I need to be shot at first to feel better when... yes. Rarely enemies did not correct their position when only partially behind cover and when being shot at.- Violence: I may be getting closer to the point when I simply saw it often enough, be it a simulation only. I already focused in this ID game on the technological progress I could witness for 10,- € because of my very old PC before this one and the developers deserve full credit for it, and I forgot most of the bloodshed already or so it only seems to me because I also know now there are some consequences in our brains if we make violence more than an occasional experience in our life, there is scientific evidence for this afaik and there is a lot of killing in this game of course, the killing of images of human beings most of the time. What I certainly do remember was ""The best idea a 12 year old ever had."", it was the description of a weapon. There was at least one other description which I personally would not want to be responsible for. I may return again to an ID game to watch true progress too but I will give a decision and consequence heavy experience more than one try before getting the new Doom if at all, guess I will wait and buy when and if I get the honest feeling that they get what they deserve, from the demo it seems you shoot evil daemons and possibly with good reason, so all right. For me and increasingly it really does make a difference if there is a good reason for the killing. Now there certainly are reasons for the violence in Rage but the justification feels done halfheartedly 'on the way'. It gets a little better at some point when you get an explanation why the main opposing faction indeed needs to be stopped but behind the shallow story the bad guys certainly are out of their minds simply because we sometimes like to be out of our minds in games. According to the achievements 65% of the players have not even seen the said explanation btw, maybe single player is not important for many and/or the game does not update achievements when you get them in offline mode. Anyway, Rage is bad science fiction at best, certainly a game for 18+.- Though not really a new idea the early setting of the game is ok. Asteroids are a potential 'civilization ender' as someone from NASA did say. You pay with paper money called 'dollars' in the post apocalyptic world, that's another thing I did not forget but this somehow was funny at least.- Some people claim to have finished this game in 12-16 hours, in my case the in game timer (not steam) showed 24 hours at the end. Well, I tried to avoid death but that's quite a difference still. And the (last) hope of the wasteland was destroyed anyway 5 times total in my case, 4 times because of impatience if memory serves.

The missions are all slightly different and (at least for me) the game never feels stale or lacking in content.Once you've finished the main storyline and the missions from the jobs board there are always the sewers to clear and now the scorchers DLC which, while quite short, I found to be increadibly entertaining.I get bored very easily and so there are very few games I have played all the way through, let alone gone back to for a second play though. Rage however is one I just can't get enough of.			"

												Worst ending to a game I've ever played. The game itself was pretty good, the graphics were great (aside from texture pop in). I would highly recommend just quitting the game right before the last mission, and imagining yourself fighting a huge epic boss and not experiencing the real thing.			"

												This review one is base on the dlc as well and it fits perfect with it if you have not played the game before.First off I would like to say I really like the game and  most of what it tries it does really well.  I personally only have few grips with it. Crafting : Although there is not much 19 receipt however I found all very useful Pop-Rocket is my prefer receipt and combine with the ""extended loader"" upgrade it is a life save when fighting Mutants on mass. And the high the difficulty the more valuable it is to craft.Freedom within a set environment: Personally I do not mind that it is not open-world actually it is better this way for me and you can revisit most locations on foot or in you car.I have never like fallout 3 open world always had the feeling nagging me that this is so much you have not explored yet even if I am pretty sure I have visited all of the marked areas.The Story: Well it might not be a master piece but I rather enjoy it and it brings you along the world to new places. I will not say anymore to avoid spoilers as much as I can.The Races: no not the different specie what I talk about it the in-build racing this scales with your difficulty and you will have to do some to be able to get the equipment need to complete and start some quest. To be honest I do not like that it is force but I can see the reason for it as the difficult would be too high without those items. After that you collect the currency to upgrade you car with other weapons, armor and front grill all of this helps you out in the wastland.BUG: there is a bug here when it comes to earn additional race credits from Sally amoge others I have found that you have to set it to active to be able to earn the credits. Thanks everyone on the community page your help was immensely helpful :)One of the things I do not like, that I can voice without spoilers, is you have a set character no way to play as a female. It is not need but I prefer to be able to chose it for replay ability.			"

												Tough call on on if I should recomend this game or not.  On the one hand, I was very enjoyable.  The shooting felt good, the AI was challenging (even if it realied on bullet sponges) and the visuals where great, but on the other, it was not worth a full price game despite clearly being a great quality game.  I think my biggest complaint is the lenght.  It plays like a quest hub game with a splash of exploration and open world, when in fact this is completly on rails.  It just felt ""off"" at the quality that went into this game only to have it so shockingly short.  Expecially when the plot, setting, and myself where just begging for more.  Over all I recomend as I enjoyed the game and was not disapointed for the low price I got the game for.			"

												The game can't quite decide if its a non-linear open-world game or an on-rails corridor shooter. It's still fun though, especially at the beginning. Racing, shooting, gathering, crafting.... the game even gives you a believable reason for regenerating health.  The setting and gameplay will grab you, maybe not as tightly as some games but still to a degree.It's only at the end that it all starts to fall apart.  While so much of RAGE's setting is fleshed out and detailed a few key things aren't, things like the bad guys.  The obligatory ""Evil Empire"" you're supposed to be fighting is really ill-defined and only vaguely talked about, except in the context of ""well they're evil, duh.""  Since the end game deals extensively with them, the game starts to suffer.The absolute worst point of the game is the end.  The ending literally took me by surprise, as in ""wait, that was the last level?!""  I will not spoil the ending itself, but I guarantee you will be disappointed. Disappointed not for what happens, but for what doesn't happen, specifically ANYTHING.Still, the beginning is pretty fun, and the underlying mechanics of the game are sound.

												I'd reccomend you get this game in a sale, if you're interested in a post-apocalyptic linear FPS. It is not worth the full price at any rate.Mainly because RAGE is NOT a groundbreaking FPS. It's a linear FPS that tries to look like open world and fails massively.It's a fun shooter, weapons feel good and are varied (although I ended up using a good old shotgun most of the time). Driving around in a vehicle is enjoyable, and the overal atmosphere is fine.But the world is only open to about ten minutes of exploration. Then you'll find out it's only a handful of canyons connected together and most of the locations are locked and accessible only during certain quests. Everything else you see in the distance is just a picture on the wall. But your movement is limited even when on foot. Most of the obstacles in your path (like railings, chairs, tables, crates and such) are surrounded by an invisible barrier that allows you to shoot through, but doesn't allow you to jump over these obstacles. Which becomes even more annoying when you see your enemies parkour-vaulting over them, popping behind them, or shooting blindly from cover - all the things you can watch but cannot do.			"

												Rage, if nothing else, is one of the most solid first person shooter experiences I've ever had. The graphics, despite the game taking place in a desert, is gorgeous.

												I would reccomend rage on a sale or free. (That is how I got it).  It was very visually appealing, lots of rich terrain and infastructure. I felt like as soon and I got a feel for the game it was over. There are two main areas with what seemed like a dozen or so quests per area and then it is over. (I logged about 30 hrs, but really 20 of that was pushing the quests).The weapons were pretty fun (like watching enemies dance when you hit them with a dynamite dart in the hand) but again I wanted more interaction with the Authority. I wanted more technology from them coming at me and more difficult bosses.  The weapon ranges were pretty cool and I wish there were some challenges in the game that demanded creativity in the choice of weaponry and bots.  You could basically go through the game and use only the shotgun pop rockets and the fat mamma's and be fine.(another fun one is the flame thrower guys.. just shoot them with anything you have and they will sort-of turn away... when they turn away exposing their fuel tank shoot the valve and BOOM)From 0 to 100 I would rate it in the low 70's.  I won't likely play it again.  Pretty fun though.Seems like a book, or series of books about this subject would be better. I really wanted more detail about the post-apocolypse and how the authority came to power and what sort of technology they had. Didn't get much of that.			"

												This is THE game that made last year's remake of DOOM possible; DOOM 3 was good, but it still divides fans today.Sure, RAGE may come off as more of the tired, but classic post-apocalypse setting cliches, but id made them fresh again, with their know-how, and from borrowing asteroid 99942 Apophis from the headlines of 2004. Wingsticks are one of the game's trademark weapons, a pity they didn't get quite the following I for one expected them to get.Your rogues gallery of enemies consists of a fairly fresh take on the standard wasteland faire, including the Ghosts, who may or not be the unintentional forefathers of the Warboys from Mad Max: Fury Road. You are also up against the Authority, whose flag, weapons and red-and-black power armor evokes Hitler's SS; then there's the Mutant Bash TV gladiatorial show, hosted by the hilarious J.K. Stiles; RAGE's twists on After The End are the emphasis on vehicles, both to cross the wasteland, and to compete in racing and demolition derby mini games.One of the last adjustments RAGE makes to the recipe is its weapon and vehicle customizations, bought here and there from merchants, or from mechanics with special credits earned from racing. Yes, id put in a version of the BFG from DOOM - and no, I'm not gonna tell you WHERE exactly!Like a nice little bow atop RAGE's neat package, you also have bit roles of John Goodman voicing the first character you meet, and sexy voiced Steve Blum as John Marshall, the leader of those fighting the previously mentioned Authority.Let's face it - without the Scorcher's DLC, RAGE is actually pretty damn short; but with the Scorcher's, you can keep your game going long after the credits, AND you have more reason to hope for a sequel or an HD re-release.Fans of id Software's 26-year track record shouldn't pass this one up.""Ashes scatter, Burnin' Jacob's Ladder, I'm afraid I might fade away!""

												I can only comment on the single player campaign of the game and I did not buy the DLC 'The Scorchers'.- Game is from 2011 but graphics are fine in my eyes. Well, they are good enough that you also will notice that a lot of textures look low res when you come close, for me this was not a big problem, I had a very old display and system a few weeks ago. If you think a game like for example Skyrim looks bad then you may already be used to something different and please keep that in mind if you continue reading.I had very little texture popping after I found a fix for the issue on the net. Once I bumbed into an invisible car.- Music and sound effects are good too, music I often turn off because I like to concentrate on the effects and ambience but this music I listened to, it was quite fitting, situational and well done.- Difficulty: The game was so easy in the beginning that I switched to the highest difficulty early, you can do this without restarting. I have a tendency to slowly explore and hold my position in a single player FPS if that is possible, this and the fact that there is no gun swaying when you zoom in with certain weapons was the death sentence for a lot of the standard enemies in this game. There is recoil of course but you just need to be a little patient and use your cover. Enemies use grenades but you have the time to get away, they will yell 'use a frag' or something similar and then you know you soon need to retreat a bit, also grenades tick and the direction you need to avoid can be seen on screen once the grenade gets close. If enemies decide to leave cover and charge then you usually will hear about it too. Being patient also meant I did not need any healing besides the auto healing most of the time, the auto healing in this game especially means that scouting will not cost you anything in a lot of situations. Then there were agressive standard melee enemies, mixed sometimes with other enemies and this was a bit more challenging. But you may know what is the standard close combat weapon and it's powerful. The last mission again was a little more difficult but of course you also have the most powerful weapon then. For some reason I did not get myself to use self made rules, if you give Rage a try and are an experienced FPS player then maybe hurry sometimes though there often is no need, you could limit the amount of ammo for certain weapons per mission in the beginning at least, something like that. Later the game got a little more difficult but for me the highest setting was ok and I finished the game with a lot of unspent resources in my inventory.There was a side quest that was a challenge and there may be more side quests and/or races that are difficult, I did not play through all of them because side quests from the job boards often lead you back to an area you know already. And I am bad at race games, winning the easier races though was sufficient to be able to buy enough upgrades.- Characters look good and one in particular was done well enough to let me hope for some more story telling at a certain point, though I did not expect a story rich game. The tension after all did rise after that, there were 3 boss encounters, the atmosphere changed to be more threatening and a tougher fight. It's ok when a game has its climaxes and its weaker moments, the alternative can be boring.- Story: Do you know the line 'Skip that if you want.' ? It's the beginning of the 'story' of the first Doom iirc. The developers have come a long way, skipping text is required regularly now (joke). Seriously you should not try to skip the story completely although - to quote a line in the game - 'no one reads' in the world of Rage. Not going to spoil it, I just suggest we don't let it come to this. Though the game is not too short imo the story was almost over when I found the main purpose for a hero in the wasteland, from that perspective the game seems unfinished. Overall the story is very shallow.- Easy difficulty does not mean it is a game with weak level design, after exiting the wasteland everything is quite linear and some places indeed were a little boring but other locations were well done and there are a lot of scripted encounters. Actually 'scripted encounter' is just a category I'm used to, the 'standard AI behaviour' if something like that exists in this game separatly is not bad at all too. Enemies behind cover for example often are not stupid, you just are too powerful for them usually. Compared to what I am used to the AI has improved a little. But I also have to say the last mission is a letdown. It also is quite short..- Some of the buildings look like from a different planet, maybe they hired an architect tired by the restrictions of reality, nice.- No bugs besides the invisible car I think. Well, once two enemies looking at me did not shoot until I got very close which I 'had to do' because I guess sometimes I need to be shot at first to feel better when... yes. Rarely enemies did not correct their position when only partially behind cover and when being shot at.- Violence: I may be getting closer to the point when I simply saw it often enough, be it a simulation only. I already focused in this ID game on the technological progress I could witness for 10,- € because of my very old PC before this one and the developers deserve full credit for it, and I forgot most of the bloodshed already or so it only seems to me because I also know now there are some consequences in our brains if we make violence more than an occasional experience in our life, there is scientific evidence for this afaik and there is a lot of killing in this game of course, the killing of images of human beings most of the time. What I certainly do remember was ""The best idea a 12 year old ever had."", it was the description of a weapon. There was at least one other description which I personally would not want to be responsible for. I may return again to an ID game to watch true progress too but I will give a decision and consequence heavy experience more than one try before getting the new Doom if at all, guess I will wait and buy when and if I get the honest feeling that they get what they deserve, from the demo it seems you shoot evil daemons and possibly with good reason, so all right. For me and increasingly it really does make a difference if there is a good reason for the killing. Now there certainly are reasons for the violence in Rage but the justification feels done halfheartedly 'on the way'. It gets a little better at some point when you get an explanation why the main opposing faction indeed needs to be stopped but behind the shallow story the bad guys certainly are out of their minds simply because we sometimes like to be out of our minds in games. According to the achievements 65% of the players have not even seen the said explanation btw, maybe single player is not important for many and/or the game does not update achievements when you get them in offline mode. Anyway, Rage is bad science fiction at best, certainly a game for 18+.- Though not really a new idea the early setting of the game is ok. Asteroids are a potential 'civilization ender' as someone from NASA did say. You pay with paper money called 'dollars' in the post apocalyptic world, that's another thing I did not forget but this somehow was funny at least.- Some people claim to have finished this game in 12-16 hours, in my case the in game timer (not steam) showed 24 hours at the end. Well, I tried to avoid death but that's quite a difference still. And the (last) hope of the wasteland was destroyed anyway 5 times total in my case, 4 times because of impatience if memory serves.

Aside from the FPS, you'll have racing and some other mini games to play. The combat system is responsive@really satisfying feel. The AI are fairly smart. You'll get to experience it when you put up a fight against groups of mutants and the humans factions.Rage is set in an post-apocalyptic time. It feels like a combination of mad max & borderland. I'll give you the bad news first. You'll be spending most of your time driving. The good news?  No nonsense farming for random glowing loot & you'll get to blow up lots of enemies/vehicles/mutants while exploring the land -or-trying to get from point A to point B. Unlike borderlands, you'll only have a limited choice of weapons & customization to choose from. Some are pretty nasty & interesting (for instance the Nail Gun or the remote control car with bomb) BUT you'll need to replenish the ammo constantly throughout your travels. You either buy them or craft them from your salvages.The road to richness is a long one, you'll get to play some mini games to to earn cash, a tv arena to earn more cash and a few racing arena where you'll have to invest your time to get the vehicles upgrade parts for your sweet ride.The story is linear but definitely an interesting one. Not as funny/whacky than borderlands but is still refreshing to do them after X amount hours on the road (smashing/blowing up everything that moves). There's Multiplayer option as well however I have yet to try it out myself.My Summary:It was refreshing and fun at first but after a XX amount of hours into the game, it gets pretty boring@repetitive but what kept me going was the story. The interesting fights/scenario you're put into. Late into the game however, there's a sudden spike of difficulty. That's a no-no for me. I wasn't pleased at all with ending. (There wasn't even an epic boss fight!) Despite the awesome guns/combat mechanic - there is no replay value for Rage. It was a sweet, one time experience for me. On the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for Rage is a 6/10. "

It’s a constricted open worlder, it runs well, the graphics are brilliant, sweet enemy AI, shooting/ driving mechanics feel a little constricting (but overall good however), there are some compulsory mini games/ missions and they suck.

												I'd reccomend you get this game in a sale, if you're interested in a post-apocalyptic linear FPS. It is not worth the full price at any rate.Mainly because RAGE is NOT a groundbreaking FPS. It's a linear FPS that tries to look like open world and fails massively.It's a fun shooter, weapons feel good and are varied (although I ended up using a good old shotgun most of the time). Driving around in a vehicle is enjoyable, and the overal atmosphere is fine.But the world is only open to about ten minutes of exploration. Then you'll find out it's only a handful of canyons connected together and most of the locations are locked and accessible only during certain quests. Everything else you see in the distance is just a picture on the wall. But your movement is limited even when on foot. Most of the obstacles in your path (like railings, chairs, tables, crates and such) are surrounded by an invisible barrier that allows you to shoot through, but doesn't allow you to jump over these obstacles. Which becomes even more annoying when you see your enemies parkour-vaulting over them, popping behind them, or shooting blindly from cover - all the things you can watch but cannot do.			"

												This is a great game with a few drawbacks. Gameplay is amazing... (reminds me a lot of Wolfeinstein) but the story is only about 6/10. There is no end boss; in fact the biggest boss in the game is about halfway through. There is some repeditive busy work but again, taking people out in this game is amazing. It took me about 17 hours to go through everything and I believe it has some good replay value. Now that I know the game, I am replaying on NIGHTMARE mode and finding it a lot of fun.This game goes on sale every once in a while so I suggest you wait and pick it up then but I don't think you will regret your purchase.9/10			"

												Rage is something of a departure for Id in that there is more to Rage than simple FPS mechanics. Sure the shooting is there and what shooting there is is incredibly well done with locational damage and some decent weapons. As well as some amazing enemy animations as well as AI that is impressive in it's ability to take cover. Rage offers more than this though with it's light RPG elements such as crafting and ""quests"" and the buggy driving mechanics which will come in to play while travelling to your quest locations. Here Id's abilty shines with car combat that wouldn't be out of place in a dedicated arcade racer.What really impresses though are the NPC animations, such as the blind Dr with the shoulder robot or the Mayor of Wellsprings who all show movie quality animations and facial tech. Just be wary if you're an ATI owner as there are some driver issues related to this game. 8/10.			"

												So after finishing the game that I was really looking forward to, I have mixed feelings with RAGE.PROS:+Great action. +Addictive driving and fun car combat. Fun races too! +Great weapons with good sounds+Impressive graphics once setup properly.CONS:-VERY linear -LITTLE exploration. No free roaming à la Borderlands / Fallout 3. -Few side quests / jobs to do.-No deathmach mode for multiplayer (very unlike id Soft)-Online racing can be tedious to find other players.-No BOSS FIGHT in the last chapter (quite unlike id Soft)-No proper closure of the campaign mode (still no DLC)-ATI Drivers issues at game launch made the game unplayable till months later. (Waited 5 months till the game was playable!)Saddening this game took MANY MANY YEARS in development and it ended up like this. Promising game with many letdowns. OVERALL:A disappointing game with fun shooter elements like id Soft are known for and that it could've been so much more. RATING:7.0 / 10UPDATE:If you loved playing RAGE, you may consider playing the single player DLC which is decent but don't expect more story into the game, unfortunately.			"

Sure, you had to mind your ammo count but I was never lacking.  Graphics and scenery were cool and it reminded me a little of Borderlands and maybe a bit of Stalker in a different situation.

												This is DOOM creator´s Jhon Carmac last piece of ♥♥♥♥.Bethesda should know better than join up with ID software. The Game falls short right in the second wordlmap - this is ID´s post apocalypse shoot gallery with vehicle races, but if you tought ""ELDER´S SCROLLS!"" when you saw BETHESDA in the credits, look more carefully and you´ll see ID´s software is there too. The graphics are amazing and the game is open-world... if you consider a two-square mile canion with uninteractive gorgeous scenarious where you CAN´T GO open-world. You race in normal races and stupid ones where the objective moves constantly - so even if you tuned up your car you end up losing because you have no idea where to go - and battle with them, either against easy enemies or an horde of final ones, inside and outside the lanes. This was supposed to be a post-apocaliptic race battler with RPG elements. What´s the problem with it? ID´s software dumb touch is the problem. Closing the player in a dead end with either a wave of enemies or big bosses, dumbly blocking strategical positions and exits with impassible little fences, like DOOM does. limiting ammo and grinding, removing maps from interiors so you get lost after you finish the level (the old 'where the ♥♥♥♥ next?!?'), and the most imcompetent corpse-looting in the history of games (not like STALKER where you can loot weapons, or Elders Scrolls where you can even loot armor: this ♥♥♥♥ get 5 Bucks per corpse and a little random ammo). Yes, it´s just like a Bethesda game... if you diminished scenario, casualized inventory and cutted the open world to a little canyon. I rarely write reviews, but after THIS game all i can feel is... RAGE.			"

												Unfairly maligned as a Borderlands wannabe upon initial release, id's post-apocalyptic shooter isn't particularly deep or expansive but it remains consistent to its vision throughout. Sporting impressive environmental design, your progress is largely driven by a desire to simply see what visual wonders id have in store for you, just as long as you don't feel too strait-jacketed by the limited scope of the combat.

												Rage is a classic first person shooter with a post-apocalyptic scenario.Graphics:     7/10The good news is that the game on the whole looks very good. When you play it for the first time you will have the ""wow-effect"" as soon as your character leaves the survivor capsule. The particle effects are not exeggerated and suitable. When you get the first weapons you will agree that the developers put some work into them. They may not be everbody's taste but the visual quality is unquestionably good. You can say the same thing regarding the environment.The bad news is that if you look a bit closer at the textures you will be very disappointed. Some are very blurred and directly next to them some are razor-sharp ones, what underlines the blurring even more. It looks like someone mixed Crysis 3 textures with Minecraft textures. Nevertheless the game has a good appearance concerning the graphics.Sounds:     6/10The weapon sounds are really powerful (especially the shotgun). Usually the rule is ""the louder the gun the more damage you do"". The cars have a nice engine noise. While most of the enemies say nothing or have nasty sounds you don't want to hear the villagers have pleasant voices. I appreciate that the developers tried to give everything a sound. That made the game lively and authentic. Due to the really bad enemy sounds I give 6/10. The developers could have made it better than that.Gameplay/Handling/Equipment:     9/10It's an ego-shooter, you will get what you expect. You will spend most of the time shooting mutants and bandits. To keep the player entertained the developers wisely added some side missions to break the monotony. Besides that you can gamble, enter an extensive racing competition to win car upgrades and new cars, play cards with a ""trading card game"" or risk some fingers in the knifegame. The handling is nearly perfect. You can quickly change weapons and ammo type, draw your grenade or fix yourself up. Steering a car is really easy. The equipment is very nice. The different ammo types make the game interesting. If you are tired of normal shotgun ammo then craft explosive ones to transform your shotgun into a grenade launcher. Especially the crossbow has a lot of special bolts.Level design:     8/10The level design is pretty narrow with some exceptions. This makes the combat straightforward and the shotgun your best friend in close quarter combat. The exceptions are mostly the parts where you are driving the car. Sadly there are only two or three sniper side missions. The level routes are very interesting and sophisticated. You will have few monotonous areas in the game. The only really monotonous part is the open world which connects the mission locations.I loved the level where I had to go to the destroyed city to get the defibrilator-upgrade. It gave me a real apocalyptic feeling.Enemies/AI:     5/10The AI is relatively poor. Except for some scripted events the enemies are just charging at you or are not using the covers properly. They don't have teamwork or act structured. Well at least some enemies use special abilities like the ""octopus-like"" enemy with the hook. The enemy variety is relatively low but it doesn't really matter.Story:     3/10The beginning and the basic idea was actually cool but it seems that the developers lost their creativity in the end. You are a survivor of a meteor impact and then... well and then you have to deal with the new world. There are some people who want to use the rescue-capsule for something and you want to free the civillians from the enemy influence and make sure that the capsules don't fall into enemies' hands. I don't really get it, what's so damn important about the capsules? They missed the ""legendary"" reason to fight a big bad company. Im sad that they wasted potential here. Even I could have made a better script for a story. And the biggest disappointment awaits at the very end. No big fight (not bigger than before), noone really cares and nothing you could call an ENDBOSS. The game was made to have an endboss. I was 100% sure of it: There has to be one. But poof. Nothing at all. Borderlands 1 had a crappy Endboss but at least they developed one.Critic summary:     6,3/10Personal fun rating:     8/10     [very good game]With all it's problems and missed opportunities the game is still worth a try.If the developers make a sequel I desperately hope for them to implement an endboss.The game may not have an exciting ending (extremely boring to be honest) but the gameplay and the atmosphere at the beginning and midgame is really enjoyable.I recommend it to buy it for 10 bucks or less.

												Rage is a decent game, but I felt a bit disappointed with my overall experience. It has great action, nice visuals, and a decent AI; However, the game felt like it didn't live up to what I was hoping it to be. Instead of a more sandbox style game, it becomes a rather repetitive experience. Rather than seeing the fruits of you labors, the game has you go through a number of quests in a barely existant plotline that isn't rewarding on its own. I felt so disappointed with the game that I stopped playing it before I finished... something I normally never do, regardless of how bothered I was with the game			"

												Review, not recommendation.The game is rather fun to play and is a straight forward shooter.  If you enjoy FPS's you'll enjoy RAGE.The setting feels appropriate, and the people populated into the world by the writers and actors fit the situation perfectly.  It was refreshing to have the characters populating the world feel like real people rather than plain cardboard cutouts.Like most sci-fi shooters in post apocalyptica, the weapons vary from a very basic pistol to a rocket launcher or a energy mini-gun.  As per normal, the only weapon in the game that can one shot anyone is a 'hi-tech' crossbow, and it can only do it if the enemy doesn't know you are there.There is a MadMax car component to the game that isn't bad, but I don't really view it as a core component to the game.  The car is mostly for getting you from point A to point B.  The car racing/demo derbies are fun distractors from going off and playing the other parts of the game.Overall, I'd say the greatest reason to play RAGE is the atmosphere and the well portrayed NPCs.  Most everything else is pretty generic.The story is pretty good, but the ending felt like a let-down to me personally.  Especially considering some of the things you do in game prior to its conclusion.Overall rating: 6/10 (Get it if you like shooters, you'll probably enjoy yourself)			"

												If you are coming here expecting something with plot as great as Modern Warfare or New Vegas, turn back now.  If you want an open world full of systems and dynamics on par with the GTA series or the Fallout Series, turn back now.If you want a shoot mans game  that feels good and natural and intense as you approach a room full of hostiles, click buy.  I really wish the gunplay in this game was copied over into those other games I mentioned earlier.  The character models, the feel of the guns, the doubt as to whether you want to risk your high end ammo for a good kill or tough it out with smaller weapons to save the good bits for what is down the hall, that feels good.The crafting system is surprisingly fun, especially with the ability to craft turrets, spider drones, RC car bombs, and some meds, this is crafting that's on par with what new vegas had, more accessable actually.But all this comes at the cost of texture pop-in in the exterior, a shoddy story, pretty but lifeless towns, and an experience which is fun but kind of hollow. Get it cheap but get it to understand good gunplay.			"

Think Fallout as a first-person shooter/racing game.  The story line is pretty generic, and there's far less content that I hoped, but what is there is great fun, especially for something that started life as a mere tech demo.  I can't stop playing Tombstones, one of the many gambling side-games available.  I sincerely hope they revisit this world and give us more to explore in the future.

												All the hype and fan-♥♥♥♥♥ing aside, despite some of Rage's flaws, it is a mindblowingly fun and gorgeous gaming experience for those that love certain things about first person shooters - violent, bloody death scenes and an arsenal that kicks serious ♥♥♥! The AI was pretty darn decent (and amusing), the different ammo types were fun, and I absolutely adore sentry bots/turrets so had a fab time trying out the different gear. The racing elements weren't necessarily my idea of fun but the mixed genre was different for me and I quite enjoyed that. Its a beautiful, fun first person shooter. Did I mention poprocket ammo for the shotgun, mind control bolts and dynamite bolts for the crossbow and sentry bots / turrets? Noice. Grab it - if your gear is decent and can handle the game, you won't have much to complain about! :) "

												RAGE is another single word title game from id Software, creators of DooM and Quake. This game was the showcase for id’s Tech 5 Engine and as well as the first new IP from the company since Quake. As one would expect, RAGE is a First Person Shooter, but only part of the time. It is also a racing game at times as well as a vehicular combat game.  RAGE takes place more than 100 years after an asteroid has devastated the planet in an atmosphere that is similar to the Fallout series in some ways. You play as an Arc Survivor, a person that was placed in cryogenic suspension to be woken up after the disaster to rebuild civilization. The player isn’t the average joe by any means. He has been infused with nanotech that enables him to heal amazingly fast and even come back from the dead. First the player battles the many bandits that inhabit the Wasteland, hideous mutants and then moves on to the tyrannical high tech Authority which aims to dominate the world.     Combat in RAGE is solid and was certainly the most enjoyable part the game for me. The weapons “feel” solid and are varied. Along with different weapons are different ammunition types. Some types of ammunition increase affectedness against certain types of enemies and a few make radical changes in how the weapon will act. In addition to using weapons the player is able to construct RC Bomb Carts, Sentry Turrets and even lethal Sentry Bots to help the player out in a fight. No small amount of combat that occurs in RAGE takes place on the roads of the wastelands as you drive about. This combat can get a bit tedious at times as there is little variation in the enemies and they attack in a fairly predictable manner. That was the good, now for the bad and that is the writing. I am not saying the writing is terrible, it gets the minimum job done. But it *only* gets the minimum job done. Most of the characters you see in the game come off as flat caricatures whose only reason to exist is to drive the story along, act as an info dump or give you a mission to accomplish. You really don’t care anything about these people. Even the ones you should care about such as Dan Hagar, the first person you meet on the game and he even saves your life. If the characters you meet in the game have any real life to them it is because the voice actor gives it to them. If Steve (Spike Spiegel) Blum can’t bring a lot of life to a character, something isn’t right. Sometimes there are things that show up that make no real sense and can break your suspension of belief. Bandits with British or Russian accents? What? WHY? Heck, I remember one bandit complaining about how he missed Mother Russia. This is supposed to be a post-apocalyptic world. You just don’t pick up and move hundreds of people halfway across the planet without even a hint an explanation or reason.  Something that irritated me was all the references to other id games that can be found in RAGE. Now I am not totally against the practice of referencing, but there is a point where it breaks immersion. Unfortunately in RAGE they go to the point of shattering immersion into a thousand little pieces for no good reason I can see. From hidden rooms dedicated to earlier games (done in the same graphical style as the original game) to advertisements for DooM 3 or RAGE 2, to “Pinkies” a combined take off on Twinkies and the Pink Demons from DooM. You can even find the “numbers” from LOST in there as well as a “Pick up the can” scene from Half Life 2. Probably the best illustration of the problems I see with RAGE can be found in “The Scorchers” DLC. In this we are introduced to Sarah, a member of the Hagar Clan. It seems to me that she was supposed to be a character similar Alyx Vance from Half Life 2. But if that was what id was going for, they failed and failed badly. She starts off as a very good fighter, then turns into a damsel in distress at the drop of a hat for no other reason to give the player a reason to follow the bad guys. Sarah shows more skin than just about any other female character and struts and poses like a model all the time. Worse after going through a fairly traumatic experience she shows absolutely no reaction to it other than a “Thank You”. Wut? The main enemy of the DLC (a bandit clan called the Scorchers) has a base in some strange ruins that look like they were built by aliens. In fact I actually thought that it did take place on another planet for a while since it didn’t resemble the environment seen in all the rest of the game. The end of the DLC leaves Sarah in the Trophy Room (Yes, that is the Official Name) and never leaving. If you talk to her she will snark a little at the player though.  I guess the biggest problem I have with RAGE is that I can clearly see is that id seems to have been shooting for the next Half Life or HALO IP and they screwed it up. They had all the pieces to make a compelling universe that people would want to visit again and again, but they failed to bring those pieces together and relied on writing that is often flat and riddled with clichés. I guess the part about RAGE I dislike the most is the fact I can see the great game it could have been and is not. Despite my complaints RAGE is a good shooter and if you are looking some good FPS combat RAGE certainly delivers. Just don’t expect much more than that. sm			"

Every single part of this game is so generic and has ALL been done before. There is nothing that stands out at all.Imagine Borderlands with a slightly more realistic art style and all the humour removed. Then call it Boringlands. Then imagine every FPS moment you've ever experienced replayed in the most average way possible. That's Rage. Boring quests, boring characters, boring driving sections. Oh and a boring environment. I couldn't stick around long enough to learn more about the (boring) plot.If this was the very first FPS with driving and side quests in a post apocalyptic world then it would have been fun. It simply arrived too late and does everything in such a standard way, never trying to make its own impact on the genre.Rated BG (Boring and Generic)			"

												When the basic controls of a game feel tight and responsive, everything you do feels more substantial, and the rest of the game becomes that much more fun.  Nintendo realizes this, Infinity Ward realizes this, and apparently id does too.The stuff you’re doing in RAGE isn’t even that interesting.  While playing the game I realize that I’m just doing basic errand boy crap that would be boring in any other game – but I still want to do it.  The objectives aren’t at all important beyond being new excuses for you to engage in the game’s tightly crafted gunplay. http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=9092083 "

												Rage had a lot of hype behind it and rightfully so. id Tech 5 introduced ""Mega textures"" and bolstered some other neat features. So did the engine and the game deliver us the true ""next gen"" id experience? Yes and no.You are an Arc survivor, one of the best [badass] and brightest of humanity before a major calamity befell earth. You wake up from your cryo-sleep ready to rebuilt society. Only to find the world has been reduced to a wasteland filled with bandits, mutants and is under control of the ""authority"". While getting on your feet, helping some of the more civilized natives you come across an overarching plot that ties everything together.The wasteland that you find yourself in is a pseudo open-world. It has a clear structure of progression with separated locations on the two over-world maps to clear out. You'll take on quests from people you meet in the hub towns and you're free to tackle all your quests in any given order. You travel to each location with a selection of quads and cars, all upgradeable at your leisure. While traveling from location to location you'll notice that the big draw here is the variety the id Tech 5 engine provides. Repeated textures are few and far in between, creating some wonderfully diverse scenery of sprawling vistas. This however comes at a cost.Rage uses immensely large singular texture maps [""Mega Textures""] for each location, streaming in only that what's being looked at at that moment. The most noticeable problem is that if you spin around 180 degrees or round a corner you'll see the textures clearly stream in. Another problem this generates is that because each location essentially has one large texture file the resolution of individual objects might seem rather low at close proximity. Because of these issues and the lack of directly being able to resolve them in the video settings menu [without going into the developer console], it is recommended that you use a GPU with 2GB of VRAM. I would also reckon that because of the sheer size of the textures a SSD drive would greatly speed up this streaming process as well.Do these glaring problems still make it worth exploring? Yes. Despite it's shortcomings Rage presents a wonderfully hand crafted world for you to explore. Each location you'll visit has a clear flavor, look and feels completely unique.The level design varies and changes per location, as do it's natives. Enemies come in a variety of flavors and the AI's tactics will be completely different from one faction to another. How each faction navigates their environment differently can make initial encounters jarring and tense. All that being said, everything can be disposed of with a well placed buckshot or two. The gun-play feels like the signature id Software gameplay we all grew up on, while also throwing in some new elements [vehicle combat] that can be hit or miss. All you need to know about the guns is that the signature id Shotgun and BFG are properly represented here.To sum it all up, Rage is an interesting, gorgeous but sometimes frustrating ride that stumbles in it's execution. With John Carmack's departure from id Software it might be the last ""true"" id game we see. And that's exactly what it is, it's an id game. Now suck it up, strap in and blow some bandits away.- Full disclosure - I played and 100% completed the SP component of this game on Hard. I have as of writing this review not touched any of the DLC or MP components.			"

												I really enjoyed what I have played so far.  It is true that the driving isn't as fun as the shooting parts but the driving parts arn't bad either.  This game actually does a lot right.  It is varied and gives you lots of different things to do.  The guns feel powerful and meaty, as in any ID FPS, and it gives lots of options to customise the ammo you put in your gun.  It has a crafting system so you can make your own ammo and sentry bots and remote control car bombs and ....etc.  Wing sticks are a good addition and adds a new level of strategy when 4 guys are running towards you twirling through the air with flaming baseball bats.  The enemy AI is really well done.  In fact I think this game has the best AI I have ever played against in an FPS.  Graphics:  Are really well done.  The scenery is really beautiful as well as character models.  Some of the inside textures are low quality but it doesn't really detract from the overall feel.  You just might not be able to read what it says on a vending machine or on a computer screen.  Does not affect gameplay one bit and there are plenty of high res textures in the game.Sound: Very interesting soundtrack with the different guitar noises whenever you complete a quest.  It almost made it that much more satisfying to beat every mission.  The music in the FPS sections really sucks you in how it adds urgancy and scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of you at the same time.  Overall I would recommend this game for ID FPS fans.  If at first you are discouraged because of the racing parts, just keep going, it gets much better.			"

												Rage is something of a departure for Id in that there is more to Rage than simple FPS mechanics. Sure the shooting is there and what shooting there is is incredibly well done with locational damage and some decent weapons. As well as some amazing enemy animations as well as AI that is impressive in it's ability to take cover. Rage offers more than this though with it's light RPG elements such as crafting and ""quests"" and the buggy driving mechanics which will come in to play while travelling to your quest locations. Here Id's abilty shines with car combat that wouldn't be out of place in a dedicated arcade racer.What really impresses though are the NPC animations, such as the blind Dr with the shoulder robot or the Mayor of Wellsprings who all show movie quality animations and facial tech. Just be wary if you're an ATI owner as there are some driver issues related to this game. 8/10.			"

												So after finishing the game that I was really looking forward to, I have mixed feelings with RAGE.PROS:+Great action. +Addictive driving and fun car combat. Fun races too! +Great weapons with good sounds+Impressive graphics once setup properly.CONS:-VERY linear -LITTLE exploration. No free roaming à la Borderlands / Fallout 3. -Few side quests / jobs to do.-No deathmach mode for multiplayer (very unlike id Soft)-Online racing can be tedious to find other players.-No BOSS FIGHT in the last chapter (quite unlike id Soft)-No proper closure of the campaign mode (still no DLC)-ATI Drivers issues at game launch made the game unplayable till months later. (Waited 5 months till the game was playable!)Saddening this game took MANY MANY YEARS in development and it ended up like this. Promising game with many letdowns. OVERALL:A disappointing game with fun shooter elements like id Soft are known for and that it could've been so much more. RATING:7.0 / 10UPDATE:If you loved playing RAGE, you may consider playing the single player DLC which is decent but don't expect more story into the game, unfortunately.			"

												This is DOOM creator´s Jhon Carmac last piece of ♥♥♥♥.Bethesda should know better than join up with ID software. The Game falls short right in the second wordlmap - this is ID´s post apocalypse shoot gallery with vehicle races, but if you tought ""ELDER´S SCROLLS!"" when you saw BETHESDA in the credits, look more carefully and you´ll see ID´s software is there too. The graphics are amazing and the game is open-world... if you consider a two-square mile canion with uninteractive gorgeous scenarious where you CAN´T GO open-world. You race in normal races and stupid ones where the objective moves constantly - so even if you tuned up your car you end up losing because you have no idea where to go - and battle with them, either against easy enemies or an horde of final ones, inside and outside the lanes. This was supposed to be a post-apocaliptic race battler with RPG elements. What´s the problem with it? ID´s software dumb touch is the problem. Closing the player in a dead end with either a wave of enemies or big bosses, dumbly blocking strategical positions and exits with impassible little fences, like DOOM does. limiting ammo and grinding, removing maps from interiors so you get lost after you finish the level (the old 'where the ♥♥♥♥ next?!?'), and the most imcompetent corpse-looting in the history of games (not like STALKER where you can loot weapons, or Elders Scrolls where you can even loot armor: this ♥♥♥♥ get 5 Bucks per corpse and a little random ammo). Yes, it´s just like a Bethesda game... if you diminished scenario, casualized inventory and cutted the open world to a little canyon. I rarely write reviews, but after THIS game all i can feel is...

												I have read a lot of criticism against this game. Maybe Im not normal, but I mean that this is the best FPS I have ever played.- The good: Is an spectacle for the eyes. The cities, the landscapes, the interiors, and all the characters are lovely and nicely made. The physics is the best, how you move, how the enemies move and how they die! All that runs perfectly with an old gtx 260 m, with high seetings, just going down a little with textures and antialiasing (x8).- The bad: A problem with textures popping up. This happens sometimes in exteriors, when you are not in a car and you turn around you with the mouse. I got used, but is distracting during the first hours of gameplay. The game is too short in duration? yes, as all the FPS in the markedet nowadays. Is up to you: rush the game in around 12-16 hours or enjoy the way, play some of the minigames in the cities, do the races, and you get a longer gameplay. Not to say, if you do achievements, you know that 16 hours of gameplay can became much, much more. - A hint: if you are used to FPS, play the game in hard from start. Is not so hard. This is also a good way to get more gameplay. Rushing is not so easy then.			"

												If you are coming here expecting something with plot as great as Modern Warfare or New Vegas, turn back now.  If you want an open world full of systems and dynamics on par with the GTA series or the Fallout Series, turn back now.If you want a shoot mans game  that feels good and natural and intense as you approach a room full of hostiles, click buy.  I really wish the gunplay in this game was copied over into those other games I mentioned earlier.  The character models, the feel of the guns, the doubt as to whether you want to risk your high end ammo for a good kill or tough it out with smaller weapons to save the good bits for what is down the hall, that feels good.The crafting system is surprisingly fun, especially with the ability to craft turrets, spider drones, RC car bombs, and some meds, this is crafting that's on par with what new vegas had, more accessable actually.But all this comes at the cost of texture pop-in in the exterior, a shoddy story, pretty but lifeless towns, and an experience which is fun but kind of hollow. Get it cheap but get it to understand good gunplay.			"

												This game is feels kinda like hybird Console/PC game. ID Software moving away from it's roots. The feel of game is great and it's pretty intense with all the monster's coming and coming. The Graphic's is interesting seeing what the Id Tech 5 can do. I think they got the design of this game entirely wrong, they should of went with Linear based progression like HL2. Instead of following an RPG model which just didn't work for this game. The car should of been removed from the game.  "

												I see other reviewers' complaints about the story line, characters, etc.  I find myself wondering whether they've played the same game as me?!This game is head and shoulders above any other FPS game out there for its weapons, movement and AI mechanics. The graphics is far ahead of any other game of its time, with its texture streaming technology where they've achieved the most realistic environments I've seen to date. Also, you will not see any repeating textures that are so common in other game titles.Game characters are exquisitely portrayed and memorable. Perhaps you won't find much back story for them, but this game is FPS with RPG elements, not the other way around. The game uses RPG elements to involve you into its story, it's a tool, not and end in itself.The same applies to story line. Simple doesn't always mean bad. On contrary, simplicity is Zen, and that is hard to achieve, especially in FPS. Take Crysis 2 or 3 for example, where I've still no idea what's going on, despite replaying it few times. That's because story in Crysis seems like an addon, so I don't care for it. RAGE will make you care, for its story is essential to your gaming experience. Vehicle fights are incredibly fun, but you need to take time to master it. Weapons are punchy and satisfying, with adversaries' AI providing just enough challenge to enjoy the fights. Close proximity fights are so much fun that it took me back to Doom2 and 3 days!The time invested in playing RAGE will reward you with hours of pure fun.			"

												Rage is something of a departure for Id in that there is more to Rage than simple FPS mechanics. Sure the shooting is there and what shooting there is is incredibly well done with locational damage and some decent weapons. As well as some amazing enemy animations as well as AI that is impressive in it's ability to take cover. Rage offers more than this though with it's light RPG elements such as crafting and ""quests"" and the buggy driving mechanics which will come in to play while travelling to your quest locations. Here Id's abilty shines with car combat that wouldn't be out of place in a dedicated arcade racer.What really impresses though are the NPC animations, such as the blind Dr with the shoulder robot or the Mayor of Wellsprings who all show movie quality animations and facial tech. Just be wary if you're an ATI owner as there are some driver issues related to this game. 8/10.			"

												Tough call on on if I should recomend this game or not.  On the one hand, I was very enjoyable.  The shooting felt good, the AI was challenging (even if it realied on bullet sponges) and the visuals where great, but on the other, it was not worth a full price game despite clearly being a great quality game.  I think my biggest complaint is the lenght.  It plays like a quest hub game with a splash of exploration and open world, when in fact this is completly on rails.  It just felt ""off"" at the quality that went into this game only to have it so shockingly short.  Expecially when the plot, setting, and myself where just begging for more.  Over all I recomend as I enjoyed the game and was not disapointed for the low price I got the game for.			"

												Good game. Good fun. Unfortunately I felt a bit like I just wanted to play Borderlands during the gameplay. However there are many fun 'mini-games' and car races/events. Enough to satisfy a change of scenery from shooting bandits.The missions felt a bit too 'samey', going into a hideout or area and shooting bandits to bits, you pass an area you can't get into as you go in and you start to realise you're just going to poke out of their in about 10 minutes time. But, the story within the hideouts change which makes it enjoyable nonetheless. The addition of screaching and random moments of being trapped in with muties bouncing around made me jump quite a few times as well which is always a bonus.The ending [no-spoilers, don't worry] was a bit of a let down for me. I thought the story was going to be dragged on a bit more but it seemed to end quite suddenly and was easy to get to in the last area. Was expecting some kind of huge boss (like Borderlands) but only got waves of armored-muties.Recommended weapon:The wingstick. Mandatory in this game. Never known a game where a modified boomerang destroys all.Haha.In all, 7/10, would recommend if you havn't tried Borderlands or have finished both and want more.			"

												I would reccomend rage on a sale or free. (That is how I got it).  It was very visually appealing, lots of rich terrain and infastructure. I felt like as soon and I got a feel for the game it was over. There are two main areas with what seemed like a dozen or so quests per area and then it is over. (I logged about 30 hrs, but really 20 of that was pushing the quests).The weapons were pretty fun (like watching enemies dance when you hit them with a dynamite dart in the hand) but again I wanted more interaction with the Authority. I wanted more technology from them coming at me and more difficult bosses.  The weapon ranges were pretty cool and I wish there were some challenges in the game that demanded creativity in the choice of weaponry and bots.  You could basically go through the game and use only the shotgun pop rockets and the fat mamma's and be fine.(another fun one is the flame thrower guys.. just shoot them with anything you have and they will sort-of turn away... when they turn away exposing their fuel tank shoot the valve and BOOM)From 0 to 100 I would rate it in the low 70's.  I won't likely play it again.  Pretty fun though.Seems like a book, or series of books about this subject would be better. I really wanted more detail about the post-apocolypse and how the authority came to power and what sort of technology they had. Didn't get much of that.			"

												This is THE game that made last year's remake of DOOM possible; DOOM 3 was good, but it still divides fans today.Sure, RAGE may come off as more of the tired, but classic post-apocalypse setting cliches, but id made them fresh again, with their know-how, and from borrowing asteroid 99942 Apophis from the headlines of 2004. Wingsticks are one of the game's trademark weapons, a pity they didn't get quite the following I for one expected them to get.Your rogues gallery of enemies consists of a fairly fresh take on the standard wasteland faire, including the Ghosts, who may or not be the unintentional forefathers of the Warboys from Mad Max: Fury Road. You are also up against the Authority, whose flag, weapons and red-and-black power armor evokes Hitler's SS; then there's the Mutant Bash TV gladiatorial show, hosted by the hilarious J.K. Stiles; RAGE's twists on After The End are the emphasis on vehicles, both to cross the wasteland, and to compete in racing and demolition derby mini games.One of the last adjustments RAGE makes to the recipe is its weapon and vehicle customizations, bought here and there from merchants, or from mechanics with special credits earned from racing. Yes, id put in a version of the BFG from DOOM - and no, I'm not gonna tell you WHERE exactly!Like a nice little bow atop RAGE's neat package, you also have bit roles of John Goodman voicing the first character you meet, and sexy voiced Steve Blum as John Marshall, the leader of those fighting the previously mentioned Authority.Let's face it - without the Scorcher's DLC, RAGE is actually pretty damn short; but with the Scorcher's, you can keep your game going long after the credits, AND you have more reason to hope for a sequel or an HD re-release.Fans of id Software's 26-year track record shouldn't pass this one up.""Ashes scatter, Burnin' Jacob's Ladder, I'm afraid I might fade away!""

												Rage, if nothing else, is one of the most solid first person shooter experiences I've ever had. The graphics, despite the game taking place in a desert, is gorgeous. The gunplay is satisfying and responsive. The side quests, much like the NPCs who give them, are varied and colorful. So what went wrong?Plot wise, Rage has terrible pacing. A majority of the game is spent building your reputation. Your only act of significance occurs in the final moments of the game. Unfortunately, even the endgame isn't rewarding.Playing on the second most difficult setting, I died only twice. Rage is ridiculously easy. The AI is predictable and lacks intelligence. The guns are imbalanced. Challenge is something left to be desired.With regards to the mechanics, Rage does gunplay exceptionally well. Even vehicular combat is smooth and rewarding. However, refining the bare minimum won't get you very far. Nothing about Rage makes it stand out. Yes, it is fun. But no, it isn't memorable.Grade: B-			"

This game had a wonderful wasteland, extremely good shooting mechanics, great weapons, a fun card game, great bosses, great AI, and a lot of potential. Sadly the game also had terrible texture issues, including poor quality and texture pop. Along with a terrible short story, no SLI support, complicated mod tools that launched late, no mod support from the community, terrible multiplayer modes, and a ton of other short comings. Had this game just been a high quality PC title with a longer campaign I would have loved it. This is not to be compared to Fallout 3, I suppose that is what I was hoping for, and one of the reasons it seemed so disappointing. With the lack of SLI support, and terrible graphics (mainly textures), I cannot recommend this game unless it's $15~.			"

												Overall, this game delivers a constantly fun experience throughout the whole game, which is more than what many FPS games can claim. It feels as if the designers thought about what's fun first and let the rest of the game fall into place around that concept.I consistently enjoyed the core shooting gameplay. It rewards precise aiming in that headshots do lots more damage. However, the enemies can feel like bullet sponges at times. I overcame this by using the strongest ammunition I could find. I ended up playing most of the game using the starting pistol with Fat Mamma and the shotgun with Pop Rockets. A headshot from a fat mamma or a direct hit with a Pop Rocket is an instant kill on normal enemies. So, if you start to feel frustrated by enemies seeming to have too much health, try that out. Even then, the frustration factor is mitigated by a revive mechanic AND a quick save and quick load mechanism.There's also racing. The racing controls on a keyboard kinda suck. The wheels turn before the camera, so you'll often end up turning to sharply. I didn't try playing with a controller because I didnt' know how it would handle switching between schemes, but I bet that would be better. That issue aside, it's actually a really fun addition to the shooting gameplay and a nice way to break it up and make the environment seem bigger and more lived in. In particular, I liked how they would put challenges that would reward bonus money when you were driving to an objective. It made it feel less repetitive even when you were driving back and forth. between the same areas.It's not without issues. They re-use several areas a few times. I didn't find this to be much of a problem because you're honestly just more focused on the shooting and what the enemies are doing, and they change up the enemies when you re-play through those areas. Also, if you play on a low sensitivity like me, the menus are very unpleasant and difficult to use effectively. It's the fact that they use mouse acceleration combined with a low sensitivity setting that just makes it possible the worst menu experience I've ever seen. Thankfully, you don't need to spend too much time in menus, but it would've definitely enhanced the experience.If you want a fun, precise FPS, definitely get this game.  "

												Rage had a lot of hype behind it and rightfully so. id Tech 5 introduced ""Mega textures"" and bolstered some other neat features. So did the engine and the game deliver us the true ""next gen"" id experience? Yes and no.You are an Arc survivor, one of the best [badass] and brightest of humanity before a major calamity befell earth. You wake up from your cryo-sleep ready to rebuilt society. Only to find the world has been reduced to a wasteland filled with bandits, mutants and is under control of the ""authority"". While getting on your feet, helping some of the more civilized natives you come across an overarching plot that ties everything together.The wasteland that you find yourself in is a pseudo open-world. It has a clear structure of progression with separated locations on the two over-world maps to clear out. You'll take on quests from people you meet in the hub towns and you're free to tackle all your quests in any given order. You travel to each location with a selection of quads and cars, all upgradeable at your leisure. While traveling from location to location you'll notice that the big draw here is the variety the id Tech 5 engine provides. Repeated textures are few and far in between, creating some wonderfully diverse scenery of sprawling vistas. This however comes at a cost.Rage uses immensely large singular texture maps [""Mega Textures""] for each location, streaming in only that what's being looked at at that moment. The most noticeable problem is that if you spin around 180 degrees or round a corner you'll see the textures clearly stream in. Another problem this generates is that because each location essentially has one large texture file the resolution of individual objects might seem rather low at close proximity. Because of these issues and the lack of directly being able to resolve them in the video settings menu [without going into the developer console], it is recommended that you use a GPU with 2GB of VRAM. I would also reckon that because of the sheer size of the textures a SSD drive would greatly speed up this streaming process as well.Do these glaring problems still make it worth exploring? Yes. Despite it's shortcomings Rage presents a wonderfully hand crafted world for you to explore. Each location you'll visit has a clear flavor, look and feels completely unique.The level design varies and changes per location, as do it's natives. Enemies come in a variety of flavors and the AI's tactics will be completely different from one faction to another. How each faction navigates their environment differently can make initial encounters jarring and tense. All that being said, everything can be disposed of with a well placed buckshot or two. The gun-play feels like the signature id Software gameplay we all grew up on, while also throwing in some new elements [vehicle combat] that can be hit or miss. All you need to know about the guns is that the signature id Shotgun and BFG are properly represented here.To sum it all up, Rage is an interesting, gorgeous but sometimes frustrating ride that stumbles in it's execution. With John Carmack's departure from id Software it might be the last ""true"" id game we see. And that's exactly what it is, it's an id game. Now suck it up, strap in and blow some bandits away.- Full disclosure - I played and 100% completed the SP component of this game on Hard. I have as of writing this review not touched any of the DLC or MP components.			"

VERY narrow gaming, you can't even jump over a 30cm obstacle just because the designers don't want u to go that way even if its way too obvious that you could go there. everything around you is just for looks, no interactions AT ALL. absolutelly non. all items are fixed inside teh environment graphics. Rage is actually a quake game with an upgraded engine. That's exactly what it is.the price for such a game is unacceptably high. i mean comon, after playing scifi games like crysis, mass effect and fear, RAGE looks like an old retextured game. they put too much efford for designs and environmental graphics, but they didnt work on the rest. it is... just weird...! wait for a sales opportunity, the game is worth playing, but not for such a price..

												Must admit, I enjoyed this game much more than I thought I would.  I was stunned by the quality of the graphics and character modeling (every NPC is 100% unique).  Think Fallout as a first-person shooter/racing game.  The story line is pretty generic, and there's far less content that I hoped, but what is there is great fun, especially for something that started life as a mere tech demo.  I can't stop playing Tombstones, one of the many gambling side-games available.  I sincerely hope they revisit this world and give us more to explore in the future.  I'll be waiting in line, eager for more insane dune-buggy combat!			"

												Rage is a good FPS, the graphics are very good and the there are many weapons with several different types of ammunition. There are also some very fun misc items you can craft like remote control bombs and turrets. There is a very well developed driving element and the driving combat is fast and fun. The biggest downside I have found to this game is that it does not have the strongest central story, so don't go in thinking that you will care deeply about the characters.			"

												I thought that it was overall not a bad game, but it lacked depth. This game competes with Fallout 3 in terms of setting and mood. The graphics are nice. The shading and lighting is a lot better than Fallout. It feels a bit low poly and some of the textures are washed out despite the otherwise impressive engine.It is very smooth, even at highest settings.The gameplay is nice, but not ground breaking. I severely disliked the feeling that you are on rails the entire time. You can not even jump over small obstacles. There is always only one way to get to where you need to be. Everything is very scripted. Enemies will appear out of nowhere because of the way things are scriped. Your path will frequently close behind you, blocking your way back. As a result there is no finesse to the combat. You can not sneak up on the enemy and take them out silently (forget about the boomerangs, they are worthless). This is something that games like dishonored did a lot better.The engine would have provided the technology for an open world game like Fallout but they did not use it. It is a bit of a shame.There is no way to advance your character and learn new things (it is just a shooter, alright). You can buy a few items to boost but that is about it. There is the whole driving and racing element to the game. While it is fun, it feels like a separate game all together and very disconnected from the shooter part. The story is very linear and is lacking depth. It is also quite short. Where do those mutants come from? Why did they mutate like that within 100 years? We never get to meet people behind the authority. Why are they doing all of this anyway? We meet a lot of characters but we never get to really know them.Finally something for the game designers (and not just in this game but many post apocalyptic games): Why does no one clean up?! People occupy some ruins and install all sorts of traps and machinery but no one bothers to clean up and make the place livable? And why is there is still power in all those abandoned ruins? It makes so sense!			"

												This is a game that likes to keep reminding you that you are playing a game.  This is because the game design is very, very old, as in it looks like a very basic attempt to create a FPS - story game circa 1995 with 2011 technology.  The levels are essentaily one long tube, the enemies are sucicidal, and this game loves to lock the door behind you are trapped in a room fighting waves of enemies.  It does it so often that you can just say, ""Ill step down this ramp, get trapped and fight these guys""  and then you do, and sure enough that is what happens.  Over and over.I paid $5 for it.  It is worth $5, and maybe a little more.  It is sad that ID has such nice techology, but their ideas in game design haven't changed evolved at all.			"

												If you can get this game on a budget, then its a great buy....granted most purchases are... ha ha ha. This is a good game.  Its not quite as action heavy or remarkable as say ....""Doom"" made by ID, but it still has good things about it.    If you've ever played Fallout 3 you may have been impressed with the vastness of that game regarding the places to travel, guns to use, things to shoot, and people to meet.   Rage takes a diffrent approach by offering ""quality"" over ""quantity""  Not saying that Fallout didnt have quality, but Rage gives a smaller, more polished and prettier experince.   You dont have as many places to go, but damn it looks georgous and you even get some sweet rides to take you there (the optional races in those rides are fun too).  You may not level up your character, but you get some wicked high-tech gadgets to become force multiplyers.   There may not be as many guns, but the guns you do get all have a role that never gets tossed aside and you obtain deadly new varities of ammunition  that changes how they operate and the level of carnage they can cause. The graphics are amazing.  The character details are amazing.  The animations and behavior of the things trying to kill you are amazing.  No joke, its great to have one of the Ghosts do a parkor flip off the side of a wall to avoid your shotgun blast.  I was even suprised to notice that a NPC computer controlled ally of mine maintained realistic gun control and even kept their trigger finger outside of the trigger guard until he was ready to shoot.  Its this great level of detail that makes Rage a new experince that I would encourage others to try.  Whats not so amazing?  The way it ends.   It seems like such a great build up for something that doesnt ever seem finished.  Perhaps they put too much detail in other things and they just ran out of time and/or money, but it seems like it ends to abruptly for a proper ending.  Not really timewise, but gameplay wise.Also after completing the main story and the DLC you're going to be quite constrained.  In fallout and borderlands you can at least go around the land and shoot things.... in RAGE ( please correct me if I'm wrong) you cant unless they changed something in an update that I dont know about.

												I HONESTLY BELIEVE THIS GAME SHOULD ONLY BE BOUGHT ON SALE!!!Alright, now that I've gotten that out of the way. .  If you're a fan of Fallout 3 and post apocalyptic settings, first person shooters with a variety of guns, like driving vehicles around and even racing them in a side game, then you'll enjoy this game. It's a linear fps with an okay story, some very repetitive quests, lots of driving around like in Borderlands, and it's not all that intricate. You don't assemble any weapons, but you can buy an upgrade every here or there. The voice acting isn't the worst in the world. You don't get to set what your character looks like at atll. The game starts you right in the middle of nowhere, but you're immediately given a mission and a gun. From there on out, you do his missions to gain a couple more weapons and your own race buggy, though you don't really have to race all the time. I hated the racing aspect of this game, but since I went into it with gloomy expectations, I wasn't let down much at all. It was pretty simple, laid back and had a lot of tacked on side games and side quests. I hear the multiplayer is d-e-a-d dead! So it'd be for the single player experience if you're thinking of getting it right now. Which I've heard lasts around 8-10 hours to beat, depending on how much exploring or time you sink inot the side games. All in all, for what I paid, I got a good amount of play time just waiting for me to log back in, but I wouldn't have purchased it if it hadn't been on sale. I'd say if you like SP FPS and a good sale, get it. If you like shooters that have a multiplayer slaughterfest of 1 on 1 or team vs. team, then this is definitely not the game fore you. But I think if you can get it and the DLC for 7 or so bucks, you should.  "

												I remember how much ♥♥♥♥ this got when it came out initially. It's very interesting to play it after Wolfenstein and Doom came out. Between the gunplay and story this game feels like an Id game. That is to say the gunplay is good and the story is dumb. In fact I think the story gets more boring as the game continues. You realize people are offering you these quests and it gives you the option to decline but for what!? They all act like you're doing this tough stuff when you're obviously a god, it just feels out of place. The dialog completely ruined the immersion for me.The game really shines when you're in a good gun battle. The enemy's maneuverability is awesome and underutilized. The game is the worst when you're driving (or racing) past other cars to get to the gun fights. The guns feel good but I wish the battles were more diverse. X amount of enemies spawn kill them to open a door. That happens over and over again. Some of the best levels happen later in the game. There is one fighting the Jackal Clan that has a lot of verticality and feels like a bombardment from all directions, very fun and tough! A lot of the game just feels empty even for a wasteland. You're only allowed to kill enemies in a particular room so every corridor is empty.One HUGE plus, the graphics hold up. I think this game could come out now and no one would complain, that's incredible from a game that is 6 years old. Also nice is the voice acting, they went all out and have some serious names.I kind of liked it but the game is a meh for me but you can't choose that on steam. I'm not sure Wolfenstein and Doom would be what they are without this game. I don't recommend you play this game but you might want to play, then do what you want.			"

												Being a big fan of any post-apocalyptic media of any kind, I had to buy this when it was 75% off... and I have been very pleasantly surprised. The graphics are different to any other game I've played: they are slightly odd - I don't know the technical reasons why, but the textures from afar look ultra-real, and even the far-distant cliffs and the background horizons are modelled (rather than being 'flat' images). However, sometimes nearby objects can look comparitevly pixelated. Overall though, the graphics are spell-binding. When I first emerged from the Ark, I had to loiter, agape, for some minutes. id have tried to make a 'free roaming' game, and come close to lulling us into beliving that it is one. Certain things make it essentially linear though - the 'internal' levels are 'one route only' and so feel like a simple shooter (I hasten to add that the gameplay is far superior to the tedious shoot-strafe-shoot Doom 3). Also, there is some choice as to the order of missions attempted, but really, it has nothing like the content of other Bethesda titles like Oblivion, Skyrim or Fallout 3. As the Gamespot reviews of Rage correctly say, the characters are animated well and brilliantly imagined, the driving is fun and destructive, and the mini-games are simple but enjoyable. And ok, when you compare Rage to Fallout 3, its an unfair contest. Rage doesn't have even close to the same amount of content (it even has you going back to locations to complete only slightly different missions, evidently to reuse their painstakingly-constructed maps). Having said that, Rage is a step up from Fallout 3 graphically. Overall, if you accept that Rage is a different sort of a game, you won't fail to enjoy it. Rage is all about simple destructive fun, and it looks good while it does it. Highly recommend.			"

												Its basically Borderlands but with prettier graphics. The plot's a bit loose around the edges and the grand finale is both abrupt and unchallenging. It is very visual, but you're going to need a monster of a graphics card to see it in all its glory. All in all its an okay game, there are some nice touches with sub-games, racing, and tech you can build. But ultimately it feels like half a game. Its pretty short and you kinda get the feeling that there should be more. My score is a 7 out of 10			"

												After three attempts at getting through this game (twice on Steam) and 15 hours of my life, I can safely say that this is the most boring post-apocalyptic ""sandbox"" game I've ever played.First of all, there is nothing aligning ""Rage"" with sandbox. The world you're thrown in is absolutely not open and there is fairly little you can do outside of missions. ""The Saboteur"" is a sandbox game. ""Just Cause 2"" is a (great!) sandbox game. ""Rage"", on the other hand, is a dreadful experience of clunky game mechanics, blurry textures with loading delays, cumbersome inventory screens, and most importantly, BORING fetch/kill missions with a little driving mixed in and mini-games that make me want to jump off a building.I can't tell you how many times I've gotten lost within cities or big quest areas (like the Blue Line) without a minimap; it is exclusive for when you're driving around the Wasteland. I also cannot possibly count the amount of times I've tried finding something, coming to a door only to see I can't open it - even inner-city areas are completely devoid of rooms and exploration, unless they're tied to a quest character or a merchant.The graphics of this game - well, we all know how bad they are, and for me no amount of patches and workarounds made a huge difference, except perhaps that the textures are loading a bit faster; but that's still not enough.I have yet to be interested in the soundtrack enough to listen to it outside of the game - the opening cinematic was good but the rest sounded entirely uninteresting.Unless you get this game dirty cheap on a sale, like I did, I suggest you avoid this disaster.

												Its basically Borderlands but with prettier graphics. The plot's a bit loose around the edges and the grand finale is both abrupt and unchallenging. It is very visual, but you're going to need a monster of a graphics card to see it in all its glory. All in all its an okay game, there are some nice touches with sub-games, racing, and tech you can build. But ultimately it feels like half a game. Its pretty short and you kinda get the feeling that there should be more. My score is a 7 out of 10			"

												Careful before buying: the game doesn't use steam cloud it only saves locally so back up your saves with Gamesavemanager.This is unimpressive compared to masterpieces from id like Doom and Quake 1-3 mainly because those games redefined and changed everything, but it still has it's merits. To id's credit it is a creative game that has solid, smooth combat and great weapons and enemies, one of the smoothest running engines I've ever played, and also great sound effects. It has great graphics (besides the god awful mushed textures up close) and very nice presentation value and is a lot of fun to play. The combat is really very good, top notch. One big thing that makes combat so awesome is that all weapons sound very good. The weapons sound loud and hard hitting, especially when I blow a guy into outerspace with a point blank shotgun blast and it kabooms in my ears through my headphones.id software worked with Bethesda so Bethesda had some say in it and probably nudged them towards making it a wasteland game like Fallout 3 since it was so wildly popular at the time. That's OK, but I miss the evil satanic neo-gothic stuff from Doom and Quake. It also has a horrible last boss and ending. You do many things and craft and quest and so on, then the game just ends. But id knew they ♥♥♥♥ed that up and there's an expansion that lets you play even after the final boss.This game was an experiment for id to showcase their new engine which is incredible, as I said one of the smoothest game engines I've ever seen. It performs flawlessly. Although the graphics are beyond horrible in some areas, like ground and stationary surface textures. Just a blurry mess. Actually you know what, the graphics in this game just suck balls, period. Fantastic art direction, suck balls graphics quality. Oh and if there is one thing that id absolutely cannot do, it is racing. The racing parts in this game just ♥♥♥♥ing suck and are horribly sleep inducing. Also, the mouse pointer in game menu's, all of them, never feels right. It just doesn't move normally, but loose and crappy.Despite the games numerous merits, it doesn't live up to id's standards when you compare it to Doom and Quake 1-3. It was like they said ""we are going to create a good game even if it kills us"" and to their credit, they did that, but therein lies the argument that prevented this from being their next mega-hit. But RAGE holds it's own for what its worth: a wasteland FPS with very solid mechanics, a phenominal game engine besides the suck balls graphics, and not much else to complain about other than id's standardized approach to it's production quality.Lets just hope that John Carmack didn't leave id software because this game and future projects are what their production mentality is starting to curve towards. Let's hope that we actually see them bring back the magic when they put out Doom 4.Edit: DOOM 4 is the BEST GAME EVER7.5/10			"

												 For years many First-Person shooter RPG Hybrids taken place in some wasteland has been for many of us just a regular tradition each year. With the release of Fallout and even earlier games have made it fun; Rage took up the reins of 2011 for the wasteland First-Person shooter game. Does it stack up as good as the others such as Fallout? Or would it be lost forever, post-apocalyptic style?Story/Design: The story goes that in 2029 the real life meteorite Apophis is on a direct collision mark with Earth and nearly causes mass extinction; however with the world taking precautions they start to send out volunteers in Arks with cryo-genetic hibernation. It didn't go so well, and you are the only survivor of your own particular Ark. After 106 years off that, you step out in the world for the first type, post-apocalypse...Sound familiar? Anyway, the game starts out with a great starting cinematic, yet the story is only decent, if not weak. It takes time that you can try and change the story in general and find out what exactly happened to all the other Arks. The starting point is extremely slow and it took me real motivation to try and push through it in the first hours and not completely stop the game. . Furthermore, just before the game starts to heat up and get you interested it abruptly ends. The ending is certainly jarring (and extremely disappointing) it could serve as a quality story based DLC. The game is quite beautiful though, it honestly depends on your PC though, just like any other game. With the new id tech 5 engine they say it doesn't use any of the same textures twice which is nice; however, this means that your graphics will change once you rotate the camera and will load in accordingly. This can mean textures take in at least a full second or two to load in and can make some gamers lag. It's beautiful, but as a closer look in towns you realize how fuzzy and low-style they are. Overall, I'd like to get this through to everyone, if you're buying Rage then you should NOT be buying it for the story, it's slow and disappointing and forgettable. The textures are nice while driving around, yet in towns it can a whole second or two to load in at least a simple one.Gameplay/Mechanics: This is obviously a First-Person shooter. And I'd like to say that this is a game based off its shooting mechanics and it does a fantastic job of it. It feels smooth enough and has multiple guns to choose from. The game is also a RPG mixed game, obviously trying to take from other wasteland style of games, but is nowhere near as complex as say Fallout, or even a few mechanics of Borderlands. It results in using different type of ammo, selling and trading items, building things with objects for opening doors and other objects. It's simple yet does well. It also has quests and side quests to do multiple things along with just running around, killing, or just collecting. Racing and vehicle combat is also a big part of the game, races are critical to upgrading your vehicle. The driving controls are odd though, realistic they are not and you must keep using it to feel comfortable behind the wheel. The FPS feel is great and well done, the RPG elements are simple yet for some groups can be just what they want, with more experienced RPG players it will seems a bit too simplistic for them. The vehicle combat is actually fun and is a key thing from the game. It's a fun game to play but as I said, just to play, not to hear about the story.Rage is a game not based on story; it tries and fails with disappointment. The combat and gameplay is fun and engaging. The wasteland is beautiful yet with the hiccups it might seem like an aesthetic blemish to some, yet game breaking for others. It's an above-average FPS shooter, but it's just that. Slightly above average, the same bland story as some, and not memorable as I had to force and push myself to get through it. If you want a good FPS, without good story then you can try to get this on sale. If you want story...you're going to need to find something else. 6.8/10			"

												RAGE is an extremely fun shooter with a lot of fun weapons,impressive AI,and it makes great use of its somewhat limited level design by throwing interesting enemies at you,like those dudes who run on the walls and grab stuff on the ceiling and will even roll on the ground to avoid your fire.It's one of the very few good modern shooters.The health regen isn't even a handicap to the game,because there is lenty of cover and you don't have to wait for long.I might add that your view doesn't spaz out up and down like in most horrible modern first person shooters.AND YOU ARE NOT FORCED TO ONLY CARRY 2 WEAPONSThe fighting feels visceral,the animations are brilliant,there is a lot of blood and gory headshots,and when enemies explode,they leave a big splat of blood and tiny gibs go everywhere,painting the walls red.The driving aspect of the game is neither fun or interesting,and the races are absolute uninspired garbage and seems to have been thrown in there at the last minute.You'll spend your time between cool epic firefights driving back home to get new missions,and then driving to said missions.With random events like meteors made out of goodies that fall in front of you and you have to catch them.Or bandits you can fight,but it's not nearly as interesting.The vehicles only have 2 weapons,and the game auto locks on an enemy for you.They happen way too often and you should have the option to only make them spawn when you want,or be able to teleport back to town.The story is not really interesting,and gets buried deep underground by the annoying voice acting.It's not badly voiced,but it's pointless.The game takes 5 minutes to tell you ''good job,here is reward.''And you can't skip the dialogs.(or in this case,monologs) so you have to run backwards until the NPC stops talking and come back to him to hear the next part,and keep repeating this until you can finally accept the mission.One of its biggest qualities is the the level design.It's not just the ''point A => cutscene QTE cutscene QTE hide shoot hide shoot cutscene QTE point B end'' formula.There are no cutscenes during fights.Or annoying QTEs.That deserved to be said.The game uses fairly open linear levels,with a bit of exploration.The ''open world'' isn't really that open or that big,but it doesn't affect the game in a negative way.I still wonder how fun it could have been to roam around a huge map,enter a random building,and have super fast paced firefights.There is a little bit of RPG in this game,as you can collect junk,sell it,and craft stuff.Like some kind of door opening thing that will open locked doors that lead to stuff for you to get and sell/use to shoot baddies.You can also craft RC cars that go boom.Overall it's an amazing shooter with small problems that you can easily overcome.And it has fun coop!

												It was a decent game. To start things off we'll talk about the setting. Rage is set in a post apocalyptic wasteland, the scenery is mostly vallies of stone and sand with remnants off dead trees and various other small flora like dune grasses here and there. Not a whole lot,though it is a desert like setting where water is scarce so it makes sense. The general vibe is very steam punkish with a lot of rust and metals with weapons ranging from modified crossbows to machines to plasma cannons etc.. Indoor settings are mostly tech like and/or mutatant infested sewers or a combination of the two.The graphics were well enough. I played through on medium settings and it looked good and ran rather smooth on my laptop. No blocky square head or hands, the animations weren't clunky and looked proper enough for the actions. The controls were easy enough to get accustomed too ( you can change them anyhow if you don't like them in the settings) and were accurate. They were a bit sensitive though.... During gun fights they were well enough but the cursor on menus was insanly sensitive. Straffing was very fast as well, peaking around corners for stealth turned into full blown assaults very quickly lol. The jump button was pretty pointless as well, I couldn't jump over anything at all in the game and I tried just about everything >.< .Sound was alright along with voice acting. Never had to shove my head into my screen to here characters speak or had stuttered speech. Few well known actors voiced.Haven't played alot of multiplayer yet but from what it seems it is  Racing, V.S, and Team version campaign missions from the game. All in all I loved the game and reccomend it to others. My biggest dislike was the fact that after the main quest line there is no free roam.   SPOILER:After Lassard has go you collect the I.D decryptions  just before Marshall has you activate the Ark Capsules  be sure to get all of your exploring and side quests in. After you leave wellsprings for the resistance you can go back to the other settlements at any time, prior to the last mission. As stated I advise you do for the full experience.			"

												The game is mostly underrated if you take it for what it is- a well done first person shooter with amazing graphics and some basic driving capabilities. It could have been great if they made the world more interesting with much more life to it. As it stands the story is ok, the graphics and basic mechanics are well done, it just feels empty and does not introduce anything new to the genre. It is definately worth the sale price if you have unlimited internet and tons of hard drive space.  I managed to get 20 hours out of it.			"

												The two best genres of any game come together in this post apocalyptic video game.  The racing is first rate and the survivor horror first person shooter elements make this one of the most unique games I've played.  Learning how potentially reacts to the aftermath of a giant meteor impact on the earth is intriguing.  I love the upgrade system that they included for your vehicles.

												Nice game concept and post-apocalyptic game-world but the eye straining style just tickles my brain, in a bad way. After about a hour of playing i had to take a break because i felt nauseous and my eye's felt dry. It's the same strain level as Jazz Jackrabbit... The controls are a bit dodgy, the feeling of a bad PC port is big in this game. By tapping the strafe button you take a big step to the side instead of a normal step in all of the other FPS's so the controls can be called quite bulky, invisible walls are used almost as much as in the old-school Medal of honor titles which means that you will encounter allot of these, and the inventory system is just bad, you can clearly see that it was designed for a controller. The texture loads a bit slow, so be prepared for allot of texture loads while you play.Overall the weapons and character models look nice, the intro sucked me right into the game and atmosphere but as soon as the game really began it lost all of its charm. It's worth the 5 euro's i spend on it but if it is above this price i would spend the money on a game like Fallout 3 since this is a better alternative.After playing for 90 minutes i rate it a 6,5/10, mainly due to the dodgy controls and eye straining style. This also gets my ""Bad port"" stamp of disapproval.			"

												For me the only frustrations that arose with RAGE surrounded the fact that it comes so close to greatness.  A troubled PC launch seemed to kill the multiplayer community and the DLC adds little to the experience.  Yet even the limp ending and slim illusion of player freedom cannot hide the fact that ID know all about shooting things in the face.  That is where the fun is to be had in this game; shoot all of the things, then throw spiderbots, turrets and boomerangs into the mix.  The world and character design are enjoyable, although you never really interact with them in a meaningful way.  Whilst the racing and mini games are briefly entertaining, they prove to be little more than resource grinding.  RAGE also harbours RPG and crafting pretensions that do not get in the way, but feel strangely unimportant as a result.  If any one of these elements worked as well as the shooting, ID would have been on to a real winner here.  Just imagine what this could have been like if they had nailed them all......As it stands, RAGE has a solid core hidden amongst elements that either time, money or skill (all three?) prevented from truly coming together as a whole.  Seven out of ten seems fair, perhaps the ambition sends it a point either side of that mark, depending on how you take to the games weaker elements.  Should ID have focused their effort a little better?  Perhaps; the game shines when played with a controller and employing a gung ho approach to ammo and resource expenditure, as the title would seem to suggest.  It's just a shame that other aspects of the game never hit those heights.			"

												I just finish this game on hard a hour ago,and i must tell you that it is a great action game whit some role-playng elements.The charecters are intresting plenty of cool animations, the enemies ai is great,the driving is also amesome.As this is an ID game you can expect the gunfight to be just like in Doom3,wich is one of the best fps ever made,it fells so clasic and simple yet so adictive.The Mutiplayer is dead don't expect to find games cause i din't found any,that just shows how underrated this game truly is.The scenarios look nice,the levels are super well disigned true Bethesda(The Elder Scrolls Series,Fallout3) work there,just like fallout3 you play in a post-apocalipt world called the wastland,don't expect it to be  open world like fallout but what replaces that is an imporoved action overall,in fallout3 shoting guns felt boring, but in rage its way better.The story is pretty simple you wake up in a sort of capsule and you now nothing about what appaned or what is goin on.you just wake up in the wastland and must fight to survive,the westland is full of human-like monsters called mutants,so people gather up in big citys where there is plenty of work to do side-quests,racing,card games etc..So they are safe from bandits clans mutants and thiefs,and gues what,it up to you to defend the human race,later in the game you discover that this mutants where all creted by (the elite).People complain about the ending,but i found it great,the end is just the begining of something big.So i give it 8,5/10 .thanks to the ending scene im pretty exited for a RAGE 2 ,)			"

												RAGE was delivered as a fresh new franchise (on release) which is developed and published from id software, and as a huge long-time id fan there was no question of me getting this title. It's set in a post-apocolyptic world (somewhat of a cliche' these days), and you're one of the last people from before this time preserved with microscopic nanites flowing through your blood. There's a high price to the Authority and the Rebels for you and/or your head.Although the high res graphics are locked out (which you can change through internet research), and it was off to a sketchy release loaded with issues - but then why should you trust any developer on release or close to on PC titles?The game looks nice, performs well and introduces some nice mechanics. It presents a challenge and has a nice story which you can believe and immerse yourself in. For me personally, I loved the Rebar gun which was a part of the DLC package on Steam. The rebar gun launches a solid stick of ~400mm rebar or rio as we call it in Australia, and it can pin opponents to nearly any object, it can take heads off, it can take out multiple enemies with a really well placed shot, and it will terminate larger opponents with a couple of well placed shots - it does however take only one piece of rebar and reload speeds are slow. You are able to recover the rebar once launched, and it is the star of the game, so much fun.It is however very linear in the campaign, but once you're off campaign there's much more freedom. There are a lot of annoying invisible walls, and the trading/shop seems a little tedious if you want to be well stocked at all times, but you can compete in an array of races to gain some currency.Overall it is a fantastic game, but for the average user I wouldn't rush about to complete it. If you're into FPS games and/or into id software's style I would say it's a must own. When you get a chance, make sure you enjoy this title - there'll be another one on the way once DOOM is released next year!			"

												This game doesn't get nearly the amount of love it deserves. Sort of a combination of Borderlands and Fallout without being as good as either. But still good. And fun to play. No, it isn't an open-world game. No, it doesn't have an RPG skill tree. No, there aren't any twists in the story line. A lot of people have criticized the ""lack"" of story element. But, let's face it, the story is as plausible and complicated as 97.53% of what is out there. I guess it doesn't have a cheesy, ""No! My [best friend, father, girlfriend, etc] died!"" scene, so some people don't think it is deep. Ah, well. It worked great on my computer. The movement was tight and accurate. The graphics were nice to look at. Atmosphere was amazing (which has been pointed out by many others.) Overall it was just fun to play.

												While this game has a lot of rough edges and if you do buy it you might want to look up some config or visual modification tools in order to make it work for you the game is well done for the most part.  While it may not be as open as some other FPS/RPG games out there it does bring a few good things to the table that others do not have.  The enemy models, animations and reaction are very well done, fluid and depending on which faction you're fighting against it might play out differently.  NPC interactions are good, and facial animations are very well done making them feel organic at times.  The story is a bit rough in places and if you've read anything about this game you will already know that the ending is well not great to say the least.  While I do wish there was more to the game then what is offered it was mostly fun while it lasted.  The tech in the game world is very nice and refreshing; the in game crafting is rather well done and very quick allowing you to use different items against different enemy types.  The game could have been better, defiantly, the story could have been a bit better and my god the texture pop in is the worst I have ever seen in my life, however it may not have entirely been iD’s fault based on what I’ve read.  Even on current gen systems you will at times get odd FPS loss and major screen tearing and if you have an ATI card you might want to look else where because I have read that people are STILL having trouble running this game.  If you can buy/find it on sale like I did when I got it, it’s well worth the money, especially once you tinker with the game engine to make it look/run a little better.  It’s far better then anything Gearbox has done to date I can honestly say that, it’s not a boring motionless world with singular friendly/peaceful NPCs, however it is no Fallout 3, it is very much in between, far better gun play then FO3 for sure however.

												I'm a decent way in to the game now - got all the gear, fairly certain where the end game is headed. I definitely have a good feel for the features and style of the game, and while I've selected yes - I do recommend the game - that comes with several important caveats. iD have created a shooter with some really interesting ideas in RAGE. Unfortunately, it suffers from a stunning lack of ideas in many important respects, also - most of which have to do with the actual playing of the game. It's very old fashioned, in many ways, which you may view as a good thing if you're nostalgic for FPS games of old. Weapons assigned to number buttons, 1-10? Check. Unlock them in sequence, just as they're needed? Check. Tight corridors and fast enemies for shotgun splooshing? Check. Open spaces and cover loving baddies for sniper or machine gun play? Check. Oh, and here's a crossbow. Because crossbow. The enemies, while spouting some interesting dialogue, are of very limited variety, models reused with alarming frequency. Likewise, their move sets are limited. The challenge arises here in presenting you with more enemies, or sometimes enemies with higher hit points, than in providing smarter baddies. I can't think of a single interesting villian - or hero, for that matter - in the game so far. The characters are massively cliché. Attempts at making the world intimidating, or even horrifying in terms of things you see in bandit camps, are immediately undone by slapstick bad guys with cartoonish animation. Also, it's always jarring to be lectured endlessly about the dangers of this horrifying world, how every step outside the secure towns is taking your life in your hands as hordes of unspeakable monstrosities await the frothy goodness of your very blood...and then to saunter from place to place on a quad bike or stupidly heavily armed buggy without so much as an insult shouted from a nearby hillock. RAGE is not a dangerous world. Glasgow pubs are, literally and figuratively, more dangerous than RAGE. This is a game with too many ideas, some of which conflict stylistically with each other. And despite, or perhaps because of, the implementation of these ideas, other things are just left to the side. The world is very small, with some areas getting reused numerous times, just filled with different baddies. There's no true free roaming, in that you follow a limited set of canyons to a few major hubs. Occasionally you blow up a dam, or other obstruction, to unlock new canyons and a new hub. Quests are just places to go and collect things, with set pieces all along the way. A little bit on rails for a modern shooter. RAGE also features an incredibly annoying set of outdated features which aren't directly related to the gameplay. ALL the button prompts are for xBox controllers, even if one isn't hooked up. I know it's a console port, but that's just lazy and off-putting, and the mapping for controls is far from explicit about what the assigned key will do. The game actually prompts you to save on some occasions (only seen this in DLC missions so far, to be fair), stating that ""The action is about to HOT up, better save"". Any immersion you managed to achieve in this game, you just shattered with one pop-up. It may sound like griping, but the menu is just plain silly. Select quit game...get the ""Are you sure"" message. Select yes...get dumped to the opening splash screen, prompted to press enter. Press enter, get the main menu. Select quit game, and...get the are you sure window *again*. The game also features something worth special mention: The Most Pointless Weapon Upgrade Ever. Yes, the MPWUE can be found right here in RAGE! An otherwise neat little gun, the Authority LMG, features an optic with decent magnification, good accuracy, large magazines, and an armour piercing ammo variety. It's a staple, and it comes in very handy. And you can buy a laser pointer for it. Now this would be fairly useless anyway, as the shotgun takes care of anything short range and for long range - duh, optic. But the laser beam actually fades away within a few virtual inches of the gun. Even if you stand beside a wall, you realise it's just ""painted on"" - no red dot ever appears. And, and - there's an aiming reticule anyway! Granted, I've never tried disabling it. Maybe you can. Even so, this somewhat expensive upgrade feels like a lot of ideas in this game: it doesn't matter whether it WORKS, we just think it's cool. So why would I recommend RAGE? The vehicle combat between hubs actually feels pretty good. They got the feel and speed very nearly perfect. The weapons, while outlandish and old school, are very fun, especially the alternative ammunition types. Some of the town characters are kind of fun - Kvasir is a favourite, with the little cute robot head on his shoulder nodding or shaking its head along with his conversation. The crafting aspect is pretty well implemented without being intrusive. The little turrets, sentry bots, RC bomb cars and so on, are all fun to scavenge for and use. The areas you go to for missions - should have mentioned, they load up when you enter, they're not part of the open canyons directly - are well laid out, though the path is fairly linear. A little exploration is rewarded with spare parts and such. RAGE kinda sorta tries to be a more action oriented Fallout, but falls way short of the depth and story of that remarkable world. It also tries to be a single player Borderlands, a bit, and that's just absurd. A showcase of great ideas pinned on an ungainly donkey, pick it up cheap, laugh at its absurdity, enjoy smooshing mutants with an arsenal of stuff...but don't expect awe or major adrenaline rushes, nor a deep, post apocalyptic experience.

												This game tries to be a Shooter, Racer, & RPG but fails at all 3 of them.  The races have 2 modes of difficulty.  Baby mode easy & stupidly designed difficult.  Some races are checkpoint races that show you the checkpoints, but do nothing about showing you the order.  So, you will have to try multiple times just to figure out which order you have to go in to beat the time limit.  The world is open but huge & empty with little going on other than a bandit car or two, forcing you to drive everywhere to make any progress. The shooting is average & linear like any other Id game.  Invisible walls aplenty.  The RPG part is the game tries to be sort of Fallout 3 style with quests, but just... fails... entirely...  Every side quest is ""Go kill this.  Get said item.  Return.""  It really feels like they were just being lazy with the story.  Voice actors are great at least.As for the Co-Op, I never got a chance to try it because YOU HAVE TO UNLOCK IT by beating the campaign mode first & I just couldn't take the single player anymore...  After you beat all the races & get all the car unlocks there isn't really much point to keep playing. It gets incredibly boring after a few hours.  The online multiplayer is also just the races.  That's it.  So, this game is pretty much just an action racer with shooting minigames.			"

												Rage was a much better game than it got credit for. Smooth gun play, beautiful backdrops, and relatively enjoyable NPCs. However, it took heat for a few, notable reasons: First, at launch it was a buggy, ♥♥♥♥♥tormed MESS of a game! Second, the end of the game feels like a friggen ""mid-point"" in the story arc - but nope, that's the ending. And third: The Id Tech 5 engine has issues with particle textures. That being said, up close things don't always looks so amazing.All and all, the game IS good, it just wasn't good ENOUGH. I'd say I feel this game needs a ""meh"" or ""alright"" thumbs rating more thant ""good"" or ""bad"". If it's on sale, and you like the Fallout type of world (this is similar in some ways), this is worth your time to mess around with if anything else. 4.99 or 8.99 would be fair prices			"

												Let's start immediately with the only thing I didn't like: weak finale. Really? Come on Id, you've a long list of weak finales (quake, quake2,doom3 was better though) but this is probably the weakest.Ok. Cons list done. Apart from that, Rage is probably a MASTERPIECE. You start being an old-era apocalypse survivor and, before you have enough time to understand what's happening you're diving in a BEAUTIFUL post-apocalyptic HUGE scenario. A world, so various that goes from broken highways to dead cities, filthy sewers and many many more.Graphics, The detail is UNBELIEVABLE, every single aspect of every map is placed carefully and planned deeply. You can almost smell the garbage in wasted garage or gasoline in Shrouded Bunker. It's awesome how level designers pay attention to every single insignificant detail. Beautiful. I didn't see any popping artifacts, I must say, Probably because my video card is very old engine just decides to use low texture by default (most of all in Dead City level apparently), which it's ok for me.Gameplay, It's id, come on, Obviously the best in town. Every shot you fire it seems that really hurts enemies, and their bodies react with damage + previous movement so it really seems that a running mutant, coming after you, after been shot to death, has still some inertia to die in front of you making two more steps. This is art, imo.I noticed they add a little ""RPG"" addition, like the possibility to buy / sell items and to create objects from blueprints but developers decided that, very wisely imo, this is an FPS and has to remain an FPS, so this is the only ""non FPS"" insertion they added.Environment. Various, huge, well detailed. East and west waste land differ very much one from the other.Open Word. The entire game level is open, sure. But, during missions, you've the sensation that there's only one way to finish the mission and one way to follow to reach the end of the level but, it's done so beautifully that imo is a pro and not a con.Summary. I really don't see a reason why not to buy (maybe in sale if it's possible) this masterpiece from ID Software. If new Doom will be at least 40% good as Rage, it will be awesome!! "

												Yes, we have a game running on id tech 5. I was waiting for this game since long time. First of all i like a post apocalyptic style games. I liked this one too. The negative side of this game is very poor ending and graphical failures. I couldnt find any solution for shuttering, İf you can find anything, you are free to drop comment but anyway i finished and completed every achivement and uninstall already. Story is not bad. side quests very very boring and similar. Just i did all because of achivements. The game has a cool weapons.  Rally driving system is not bad. When i start to game, i was expecting i will play mad max on my pc but i dissapointed at the end and i understand this is not mad max, this is premature borned child of fallout 3 and doom 3. Generally ==> 7/10. And yes you can buy it and play it when it will be on sale. its just snack for a couple of hours in some weekend nights			"

												In this game you can carry 10 weapons (and probably unlimited ammo)  and shoot mutants along with  high-tech supersoldiers in a postapocalyptic world. You can also be a race driver with your very own cars. Pro:The combat system is excellent (these guys made the Doom series..), and I must mention, that the enemy death and combat  animations are exemplary. If I shoot somebody in the stomach, he falls to the ground, then drags himself to the nearest cover, and prepares to die. But he's still alive, so until then, shoots some bullet at you. If I hit somebody's feet, it limps, like in reality. You can be an engineer and construct items such as sentry bots and turrets. These bots are overpowered in my opinion, you can spawn 2 at the same time, and they clear the area for you. The races are exciting, but won the first place always at the first try. The minigames are also cool. Never facede any bugs (fell off the map once, but it was my fault). Contra:However, you can't really jump. Apart from the race fields, the whole game is very linear. You go into a building through the front door,  kick some ♥♥♥ inside, then return to that door again. And almost every single mission is like this.  The characters are boring, but their mimics and gestures are detailed. The textures sometimes look correct, but when they don't, they're ugly and low detailed. You have to save manually, because the game saves only at the beginning and the end of the mission. Forgot that when I started, and had to start again a mission. This game offers much more then 25 hours of content, in overall, it's a great FPS. If it has 75% off, or more, don't hesitate, buy it!			"

												I have read pretty much everything and its opposite about that game. So I wanted to write a review, to try to give a comprehensive list of the pros/cons of that game.First of all, this game is NOT a Role Playing Game. Of course, like every single game, it can fit into its definition, since you play the role of a character in an imaginary world. Now, it is not what is conventionally accepted as a RPG. This game has no character levels, it has no skills, it has no skill-tree either of course, and so on.This game is a shooter. By the people who invented the genre, id Software. Now, if it is from the people who invented the genre, how can it only have a User Score of ""49"" (at the time of writing) on metacritic? The reason is simple: this game is really different from what id Software usually does (or did. I did not play, by far, all the id Software shooters; but I played Doom and Quake).So, what are the pros and the cons?Pros:The overall experience is rather original, refreshing, with a definitely solid and consistent shooter feeling (think of other id Software games, the weapon handling is really close to that). The id Tech 5 graphical engine is incredibly slick, does a wonderful job, and even if the textures are sometimes ugly, or even horrible, when inspected from up close; the game has really neat graphics.In addition, the world, even if not so deep (remember, this is by no mean a RPG), has some interesting aspects, and the artists did an unbelievable job making each part of it unique and authentic.Cons:id Software used to do PC games. For a company that pretty much invented the FPS genre, it was perfectly logical. Whereas I can understand why publishers decide to make every single game available on consoles, it still is a mystery for me when developers also take that direction. Not for all games, of course, Mario and Sonic were totally fitting for consoles, and so were many arcade games I played as a kid.But for FPSes, one can only wonder. I know that the fingers are probably the most precise appendices we have, but even; how can someone imagine to replace two hands with five and three fingers (for the keyboard and the mouse respectively), plus one arm (the mouse movement has more amplitude, and therefore, more precision, than a stick) by only four fingers (thumbnails and indexes), for the same result?And even if id Software managed (thanks to their extensive experience?) not to get the main gameplay cluttered by such a decision, ALL the rest of the game has been affected. Not only the interfaces.And the game also features some mandatory races, there are achievements for random games (random achievements? what's next, unobtainable achievements?), and trying to 100% the game will be an incredibly frustrating experience, for those reasons.It's also worth mentioning that the difficulty is somewhat low (that goes with the ""console"" aspect I presume: the game has to be accessible to as many people as possible), or at best inconsistent (the Scorchers DLC increased the difficulty a bit, but also gives the nail gun, which has an unlimited ammo (rebar) and a rail gun mode, allowing to see the enemies in advance, and even to kill them without exposing yourself), even in ultra nightmare (which is turning the game into a binary experience (who shoots first) rather than into a harder one), and that in spite of the obvious efforts to make the game as non-linear as possible; all the missions are constructed with the scheme: talk to X, go to Y, kill all the baddies along the way.Bottom line:The game still is worth some money, as it has a strong shooter feeling, various encounters, an awesome atmosphere. But don't expect the usual id Software FPS, it is not.Additional Note:I got an ""Anarchy edition"" (the pre-order bonus) key in order to get all the additional content. I would recommend to do the same, or at least, to unlock the pre-order content (there is a console command for that) when you play the game, as it deeply changes the gameplay.			"

												This is one of those games where you have a lot of fun until the very last moment. You REALLY wanna think this is a great game, and you'd be right for the most part. Excellent premise, good gameplay, great graphics, even for someone who has bad graphics card, it's not demanding for something that looks soo good. But then, the music happens and it's sorta, lacking something, it isn't bad, but it's not quite great either. Then there's the gameplay, yes the FPS is in corridors and the like that's similar to Metro 2033, but honestly you'd need it to be in such of a place, it sorta fits. The story isn't too bad either, much better than some of the FPS games I've played, although nowhere close to Metro and other story driven FPS's. It does leave a sense of ""disappointment"" at the end of the game. Great level designing though. Overall, I say yes on getting it and playing it, at 20 dollars? No, at 15? Yes, and if you're a fan of Metro, or Borderlands, even Fallout, then it's a must at 10 dollars.			"

												This is one of those games where you have a lot of fun until the very last moment. You REALLY wanna think this is a great game, and you'd be right for the most part. Excellent premise, good gameplay, great graphics, even for someone who has bad graphics card, it's not demanding for something that looks soo good. But then, the music happens and it's sorta, lacking something, it isn't bad, but it's not quite great either. Then there's the gameplay, yes the FPS is in corridors and the like that's similar to Metro 2033, but honestly you'd need it to be in such of a place, it sorta fits. The story isn't too bad either, much better than some of the FPS games I've played, although nowhere close to Metro and other story driven FPS's.

												I played it all of the way through once. The overall feel of this game is like if Borderlands and Fallout 3 had a baby and then dropped it repeatedly on it's head.I can't quite put my finger on what it is that I find irritating about the gameplay here, but one of the main things is that it feels like a jumble of ideas, none of which quite fit together fluidly.Visually this game is a complete mess, which I attributed originally to it being based on a pretty sub-par engine that does not support SLI setups.  Having attempted to replay it on a brand new GTX 980 Ti and still experienced the same issues (blurred, low-def textures, horrendous pop-in issues etc.) I can safely say that it is just a terrible engine.I know that this game is probably right up a lot of people's street, but it really is not up mine.Pros:-Some fun moments with the gunplay/driving-Interesting scenery when viewed from a distance!Cons:-Terrible engine (with regards to graphical issues)-Iffy storyline-Parts of it plays like a dumbed mix of the boring elements of Fallout game combined with the same from Borderlands.

												Absolutely abysmal port; worse texture pop-in than Mass Effect 1, extreme mouse acceleration (that resets itself even when changed in the config files), and frequent dips in framerate to around 15 fps on lowest settings (on a rig that runs Metro: Last Light on high at a solid 60) all make the game virtually unplayable. It's possible that these are only issues on AMD cards, but either way, do your research before buying.			"

												Rage is a first-person shooter set in a post-apocalyptic world that offers plenty of enemies to shoot, and a variety of other mini games to play.As far as the world is concerned, there will definitely be a lot of comparisons to Borderlands. It is certainly a darker, and grittier version of that world, but it is less expansive and even less characterful than Borderlands. Also, the game tries to progress the story through a series of quest-givers to make it feel even more like Borderlands, however without any of the RPG elements such as character progression, talent trees, or loot, it seems out of place. In fact, because there are no RPG elements, the story could have been presented in a much more immersive way. The game tries to add in other diversions to make the world feel more immersive. Crafting allows you to create various gadgets and weapons, but you can easily get through the game without crafting anything. Often, it is simply easier to just buy whatever you want instead of crafting it. There are a variety of mini-games, including a card game where you can collect cards found throughout the world. However, not everyone in this world plays it. In fact, only a very few NPCs play this game, and they can be beat without finding all the ""best"" cards, so it takes the incentive away from trying to hunt down the cards. The game also tries to shoehorn in a driving aspect and even lets you upgrade all the parts of the vehicle: and you can only get these upgrades through a currency you get from racing. But in the end, the racing is not really challenging nor particularly fun. So finally, that leaves the shooting element of the game. There are certainly many enemies to shoot in this game. But none of your guns seem to pack a visceral punch. They don't sound or feel strong enough, and even when at point blank range with a shotgun, most average-grunt enemies still require 2 to 3 shots to down. All-in-all, Rage is a game that has many dimensions, but none of them are fleshed out particularly well. If you are a fan of first person shooters, you may find some interest in playing through this title, but it's certainly not going to be a title you will have a great experience playing, nor will it be particularly memorable. It's pretty much the definition of ""middle of the road.""5/10 ""Mediocre""			"

												I would definitely recommend buying this game. It has a very Mad Max vibe and provided hours of entertainment. There is a standard FPS weapon spread (pistol, shotgun, SMG, AR, etc) and a fair variety of enemies to shoot at. I found the story to be standard post apocalypse fair but this games take on it is good. There is a decent amount of sidequests and even some races both with and without weapons to provide some more thrills. Vehicles and weapons can be customized as the story progresses. There is also decent multiplayer based off events that take place during campaign to keep you going after the campaign is finished.			"

												At every possible moment this game threatens to become a good shooter.  There's really no reason it shouldn't be.  It's got a gorgeous graphics engine, entertaining guns... what else do you need?  Oh right.  What we don't have here is pacing, good level design or interesting enemies.  On top of that the game just decides to end at one arbitrary point.  On my first playthrough I got through the whole game without ever firing the game's 'super weapon'.  I was saving it for a climactic boss fight or final level that never actually came.Too easy, as well.  I played through on nightmare and felt no sense of accomplishment having beaten it whatsoever.

												(review for single-player only)RAGE is a strange game. It's a mash-up of different scenarios that doesnt really fit together. It's one part Combat Cars Racing game, one part Mad Max, one part Steam, one part Zombie fps and a small but significant part sci-fi. If the dev's had only stuck to one or two and then really seen that through, it would have been great.The mechanics are good, the main story is ok to a start, side stories and quests are easy to find and do, character progression is ok, but not great but somewhere in mid-game, the devs just stopped working and the result is not what the game could have been.Too bad really, I really liked it the first hrs.It's not really a bad game, I just got really disapointed after awhile.Buy it on sale if you wanna shoot stuff in a mad max futuristic steamish world, and race cars at the same time.

												There is a lot of things I dislike about this game, but I still quite enjoy playing it. But there is some things that just irritates me about it. Let's start of with what I dislike.Negative:*You do not have an in-game town/world map, kind of sucks cause I'm one of those guys who likes to explore everything and check off certain areas as ""done"" with memorizing the areas through world map. On the other hand the game seem to be so linear that you don't need one.*The jump seems worthless, there are obstacles in the game that's not even up to your knees that you can't jump across, which makes me think ""why did they even give you the option to use jump at all?"". You can't even climb over desks, or big windows with stuff in it, you have to get a lock grinder or whatever it's called to blow up the door. That's so poor.*A headshot with the crappy pistol doesn't kill the enemy, not even 1 feet away. A bullet through the skull on a human being should kill him. (And no, I do not mean the guys with helmets)*The co-op was a bit dissapointing and really short, I was expecting being able to play full campaign with my brother and not some short missions. Maybe I did my research badly before purchasing the game.*Using bandages or creating them seem to be quite useless. I mean you do regenerate full health by just not getting shot anwyay and if you badly need a bandage you're probably screwed over anyway cause you need to swap to the bandages from whatever you're currently using, like HE grenades or whatever. A heal button is missed in those scenarios, like pressing ""H"" on your keyboard.*The mouse feels bad when you're in the menu, checking inventory, quests and things like that. Feels like it's lagging.*In combat you can't lean!! I hate that you can't lean and take cover, best you can do is to crouch behind a desk or things a like and just stand up to shoot and then sit again. I think it's rreally poor that you can't lean when your opponents can do all kind of stuff, lean, jump over desks, climb though windows, take their arm up with gun only shooting at you while taking cover.Postive:*The vehicles looks good and are fun to drive.*The FPS is overall nice, except you can't lean!*The enviroments and graphics are okay for being a couple of years old game, don't see why people complain over it really.*The enemies move good and make up for the lack of leaning.*Quests are OK.Overall, there is more negative things to say about the game then positive.I would recommend this game at a low price on sale, but no chance of getting it at it's full price, there for I do NOT recommend buying this game. It kills some time sure, but if you're out after a good fps game, spend your money on something else. "

												Just another spam spawning, bullet sponge rail shooter with mediocre graphics and AI.Honestly, Rage is a step backward from the 2009 release of Wolfenstein.As with every other iD installment, area triggers spam in mobs, even in areas you just cleared. The term ""one clip, one kill"" applies here, as mobs which aren't mutants will require a full magazine pumped into them to take them down. It takes a minimum of two head shots from the sniper rifle, which is just a forced waste of ammo. One human enemy in white armor took 3 and 1/2 magazines of ammo to drop, and that was at 5 paces using short controlled bursts so no bullets missed. It was not a boss, but just a trash mob bad guy.Graphics.I keep seeing people praising the graphics of this game, but cannot see why. I got it shortly after it was released, and even then it was sub par compared to other titles. Sure, outdoor scenes can look quite picturesque overall, but the moment you get near any items, their mediocre look really shows. It's as if, even when on the highest graphics settings, that Mipmap number 2 is being used. Some items in the game haven't even been properly UVW mapped, so they just have distorted, splotchy pixels on them. I feel this is a symptom of iD being bought out by Bethesda. Several of us had been discussing whether Bethesda would bring iD down, or iD would bring Bethesda up back when iD was acquired. Unfortunately, Bethesda won, and iD's quality has suffered.Maybe it's due to the game being a port, but that is just breaking the 8th commandment of good game development and not an excuse for releasing a bad looking game on the PC.Gameplay and AI.The game handles like your average iD game. Mouse wheel through some of the guns (have to hit the numbers on the keyboard to access the rest), shoot spamming mobs of respawning bad guys, run out of ammo and punch the rest to death while strafing backward. Grab quest item and repeat. The formula worked better in the original Doom.The AI seems like it wants to work, but frequently just starts bouncing bad guys around until you Whack-A-Mole them to death one or two bullets at a time. After an hour in game, it becomes apparent that the AI is sorely lacking, and the game becomes painfully redundant and predictable. Maybe I just played too many iD titles over the decades.If you like redundant rail shooters with mediocre graphics, AI and love spamming hordes coming and going, then grab this game. If you want any kind of sophistication or thought provoking gameplay, avoid it like the plague.After thought.iD attempted to include aspects of all types of genres, and did manage to mix them together well. They even included card games. So you have rail shooter, racing/demolition derby, platformer/killhouse, Magic cards all in one game. I don't play Magic or Borderlands because I don't like Magic or Borderlands. I bought Rage because I thought I was getting another Doom style experience according to their hype. Nope.			"

												RAGE is a very good post-apocalyptic game - a veritable fusion of Fallout and Borderlands.I'm a big fan of Fallout, Borderlands bit smaller (but always xD), post-apocalyptic game stoke in my veins for a long time - I love the atmosphere.When I learned the game RAGE is available on the PC, which is based on schemes such games as Fallout and Borderlands - we had to look at this title closely.- Initially the game it was a massacre, but:RAGE, unfortunately, was initially bad optimized for the PC, texture errors occur today (are less intrusive, but they are perceived), CPU 100%, Bugs and jams / hang-ups - are problems that PC gamers received a start. I have a powerful computer, and the above problems experienced in person - on yet another powerful hardware was the same.Today, it is already well but minor bugs related to graphics (textures) sometimes happen.- Okay now time to move on to the more pleasant part of describing the game.Plots game is great, but i shall not say anything about it. :)Graphically, the game looks very good, beautifully but darkly, like a post-apocalyptic atmosphere. The music is nice, it's OK. Map of the world large, open, move along it mainly vehicles (because after every run xD). Opponents of the computer on high (Nightmare) difficulty are strong, fast, difficult to hunt. - With bosses and mini-bosses no longer remember xDCrafting system is good, the collected things on the map create useful us the tools to fight / break in this hostile us world - weapons, ammunition, dressings etc. Missions major and minor are pleasant, varied so you will not be bored - and for the execution of them get cash (+ special additives), which can be spent on in-store purchases, improve our vehicle.Polish Dubbing, because this version I have the pleasure to have - is good, you can safely compare it to that of Fallout 3.To summarize the above, the game RAGE had a difficult beginning to the PC, but now it is a game in which you need to play - is simply very good.I surely recommend!

												The game isn't terrible, but it has too many faults to be worth buying in this day and age, where we have so many great games out there. -After a certain point in the game, maybe 7 hours in, I started to get dizzy whenever I played it. Once I beat the area where it all began, I was fine again. However a bit later it came back, and it turns out that a lot of areas in the last half of the game, just induse dizziness. -Enemies soak up bullets so much! I expect 30 bullets to mean I potentially have 30 kills in my magazine, if I get headshots. In Rage this means 1 kill, maybe 1 kill and injuring another enemy. Boring as ****-It is super linear, and you get no choices anywhere, except for what weapons to use and what upgrades to put on your car.-There is no sensitivity option for your mouse, so you just end up sliding all across the menu, never getting the mouse where you want it to be.It's okay to play and certainly not the worst I've had, but it could have been done so much better. Skip this game.5/10 my lowest rating of all time.			"

Some stuff does look blurry close up. Phones for an example. However overall it looks good for its age. My main complaint is the dumb save system. Grrrrr. Your forced to save every 10 to 20 minutes unless you like starting over from the start of a mission. Ugh. If your looking for a good first person shooter then this is a solid choice.Ok just finished the game. Took me 12 hours for just the main game. I own the DLC so I am starting on that part next. You get a nail gun. The ending for the main game is lame like everyone says. But until then its mostly good fun. I still hate the races. Ugh.			"

												Rage is one of those games you either love it or hate it.The early weapons just do not cut it.   Driving around in scrap heaps with missles and guns catching meteor fragments is/was plan dumb.  IMHO just did not add anything to the game.Crossbow with the dynomite was nice once you acquire it.  Wanted to like this game but alas, it just fell short of good.Just can't recommend this one.			"

												Visceral - an impressive thrill-ride. Starts off gently but ramps up pretty quickly and sucks you into a very real post-apocalyptic world. Some crafting, many varied mission types.

												Rage was a rather enjoyable experience for me. It was somewhat similar to the Borderlands experience however I did find it quite difficult to get into at the beginning. The story, if you could call it that is difficult to follow as you're thrown into the deep end, and then you're asked to do a bunch or errands. Hang in and eventually it'll pay off. I would recommend Rage but only if discounted and I would recommend you buy the DLC's up front if discounted. It's a solid 7.5/10 from me.			"

												I don't know, Rage isn't all that bad. The game does look great, but there are so many technical issues that prevented me from truly enjoying it. The fact that V-sync, at first, wasn't implemented was a bad choice. The texture pop-in was awful as well. Combine this with the freezing problem (every few minutes the game freezes for at least 1-2 seconds) and I'm sure you'll understand what I mean.The gameplay itself is like any other shooter. With some added RPG elements. You'll  collect a lot of worthless junk (which is a shame) and complete simple, sometimes fun, quests. But since there is no real reward for the sidequests there isn't much incentive to do them at all. You'll gain money and some licenses for your vehicle, but no weapons, schematics or anything else. Not even XP. So in the end there's no feeling you're getting any stronger. A missed opportunity. The driving segments are actually ok, but quite easy.Anyway, I did have fun with it, but I expected more to be honest.[Rating: 81/100]			"

												The best way I can sum up Rage is... if you are interested in playing Rage, you've already played this game. It is the next generic post-apocolypse shooter. It's like the sampler appetizer that has just a little bit of pieces of other games. However, this is the best looking of these games. Some of the textures look like total crap, but some areas and vistas look very nice. The game does take a lot of hard drive space for a fairly short game. Overall, it wasn't bad. It took around 13 hours to finish. The story is generic. Most of the combat is done in linear corriders. I didn't care for the hit detection when shooting enemies. Shoot them once and you gotta wait to shoot them again or the hit won't register. A lot of bullets and time were wasted having to wait through the AI recovery  god frame animations so the next bullet will register. Most of the exploration is done with vehicles that let you travel the map. I'd recommend getting Rage if it's on sale and you want some mindless fun. It is unremarkable in every way, but I still managed to have some fun with it.			"

												It's unfortunate that RAGE has been subjected to so much negativity. I'm not sure what the origins of it are. Perhaps people expected something different, perhaps people expecting something more on some level because it was the next big game by id. I always loved RAGE. Pretty much everything about it. It plays superbly, being one of the few shooters I've ever played where firing a weapon actually feels powerful and great. It has AI that, while not smart in the sense that FEAR did, they are fun to fight because they move so oddly and realistic at times. I just started playing the new DOOM today and that game is just not for me. Having to search the environment to find something specific is just so boring in that game. I recognize that DOOM just isn't doing something that I like. In the same way I feel that RAGE was subjected to such criticism because it did something a lot of people didn't like. But it is a fantastic game if you like the thing it's going for, because it nails it.(For the record, I played RAGE on 360 when it came out. Intending to play it now on PC, which is why my play time is effectively 0 hours as of this writing).			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine RAGE is a game developed by id Software and published by Bethesda Game Studios. RAGE is a great game. Really enjoyed the vast majority of it. RAGE is an excellent first person shoot that puts many modern cash-grab shooters to shame. The game feels like it was inspired by the Mad Max seriesThe game has some excellent environments which are immersive, atmospheric, detailed and unique. Some novel weaponswith a very good crafting system. There are various enemy types and also some interesting and unique NPCs. RAGE offers a long and polished campaign which you get more than your money's worthHowever, RAGE's ending isn't very fleshed outIt should be noted that a small few of the weapons are crap on the higher difficulties. This is frustrating at first, but it promotes the use of some of the more unusual ammo (rebars, pop rockets, kill-bursts) which makes for a way better experience. There are many ammo types, some really unique, which makes it great fun to experimentRAGE is a unique and interesting first person shooter which breaks away from traditional FPS games RECOMMENDED :)  "

												I like this game. It is a few years old now but the graphics are still fairly good overall. Overall it is a first-person shooter style game, but they added in a driving/racing aspect that not only seems to work fairly well, but to me adds a degree of realism to a post-apocolyptic world that so many other games seem to lack. And unlike some other games, while you can just walk around out on the main map; taking the buggy or the monarch to drive around definitely gets you there both faster and safer. There is a good amount to do in this game aside from the main quest line in the form of side quests and challenges, as well as several easter eggs from the older id software games that are just kinda cool to collect.Now for the bad. Thw game is fairly linear overall. You can miss out on things by progressing the main storyline too far too fast, and I'm not a big fan of that in open-world games. It's not too bad as long as you do optional side quests first then the main 1 but on initial playthrough it might not be obvious. Also, might just be because I'm late to the party, as in I did not buy this game when it was brand new, but there is never anybody on the multiplayer side of this so I can't unlock the rest of my acheivements. not a huge deal, but a little disappointing.Overall, like I said, I really do enjoy the game. I would rate the overall experience as about a 7 out of 10. Definitely worth trying.			"

												I acquired RAGE on a sale, and for the price I paid, I'd recommend the experience.  The world is gorgeous, in a post-apocalyptic, Fallout-like style, with some obvious Fallout-like ripoffs.  Still, it's worth it just to experience some of the really immersive visuals.  The characters and people are reasonably good, beautifully crafted, fully voiced with a variety of personalities (even if some of the acting is forced).  Also, the first ""Dead City"" experience was really memorable.The game is largely good, but suffers from a lack of direction and from trying to do & to be too much.  The crafting system is interesting and provides some value, but largely unnecessary to complete the game.  The various minigames, too, are value-added, but in the same way that finding spare change in your pocket is value-added.  The vehicles actually drive very nicely and are enjoyable, and the vehicular combat isn't bad, but the entire racing circuit side-game is virtually mandatory and--as such--is a detriment.The game is arguably broken up into three sections, by ""hub"".  The first and third sections are really short, while the second is probably over-long.  The first section, being short, makes sense.  Its an intro to the game; the starting quest hub.  The brevity of the third hub, however, and the entire third section of the storyline--including the anticlimactic end stage and ending--feels shockingly unfinished, especially compared with some real gems in the section section (Wellspring), most notably the first visit to the Dead City.Ultimately, I'd recommend the game, if only to experience the first half to two-thirds of it.

												Rage is a game that does a lot right but has enough frustrating elements to keep it from truly achieving greatness.  The weapons are satisfying, enemy encounters are fun, and the presentation is great but it's wrapped around a terrible semi-open world progression and bland car combat.

												Played it during the free weekend. love the game, decided to purchase it. I think if you like playing Fallout 3. You would probably like this game. However, i highly recommend trying it before you buy. this isn't that kind of games where reviews would do it justice. This game has to be tried first. it is either you love it or you hate it. Recommend you to try it (Take away lesson) before you buy.			"

												Right, I wanted to write the review a while back, but just kinda forgot about it... So here's my list of pros, cons and miscPros:-Good looking game-Good gameplay mechanics-Suprisingly good driving(Was expecting it to be messy to be brutally honest)-Decent soundtrackCons:-Forgettable characters-Forgettable Senario-Pleanty of useless weaponry(I only used three weapons out of the lot)-Errand boy syndromeMisc:-Mad Max and other post apoc refferences are there-Shows that is was a game made by heavy hetal loversI recommend this game for anyone who likes a decent shooter that goes out of the COD mold and it is quite fun to play, even though the senario is really... Inexistant... But still, Mutie Bash and stuff like that keep it quite fun.			"

												I don't know why this game received such a low rating. It is very good. Though it was clearly made for console, it runs very well on PC and graphics are very nice (You can see it in the screenshots i have taken thus far). I like this game very much, id studios did not disappoint. Highly recommended!			"

												It seems that success was never in Rage's destiny. id Software (known for their genre-defining shooters, Wolfenstein 3D and Doom) released their 2011 open-world shooter in a post-Fallout 3 gaming landscape, choosing to leave their world fairly empty and uneventful aside from car combat encounters. It's testament to id Software's brilliance at making a polished combat system that the many flaws Rage has don't massively detract from the fun you'll have playing through it. It's glaringly apparent throughout Rage that much work has gone into the combat. Guns feel great to fire, with multiple modes of fire and different kinds of ammo to suit the varied situations and enemies you'll be encountering. There's a decent selection of them too, with the Combat Shotgun being a particular favourite, as you blast shells into mutants and bandits alike. There's also an Engineering (aka crafting) element, where you combine components to build certain tools. It's quite fun to build Sentry Turrets and deploy them, as well as RC Car Bombs that you can drive into a group of enemies and detonate. You'll quickly find yourself creating bandages to heal up more quickly, and making a ton of Pop Rockets for your shotgun for that extra explosive bang. Simply put, id knows how to do guns and do them right.As mentioned before, there's a fair bit of car combat in the game. We've since had games like Mad Max that do this quite a bit better, but here it's not too bad. You get a selection of cars throughout the game, and you can arm those with machine guns and rockets. Most of your encounters will be as you drive from one objective to another, and you can earn money from destroying bandit vehicles and returning to Wellspring or Subway Town for rewards. There's a decent amount of things to do in the game, with races and mini-games, plus the two main towns with their Job Boards that offer side quests. The biggest issues with Rage all concern its story and quests. You're mostly looking at a run of fetch quests throughout the game, and everything feels a bit samey. There's a general feeling of ""meh"" throughout the experience, as you venture into locations (sometimes more than once if you have to go back for a side quest) and dispatch of enemies, then either pick something up to bring back to town or plant something there. This is mostly a game that concerns itself with the fun feeling of shooting things, so in that respect it succeeds, but you'll not be playing this for any interesting or in-depth questlines. It's all going to wash over you, as the story limps to its conclusion. It's clear a sequel was planned, given the rushed, open-ended final cutscene.Overall, I do recommend Rage. I enjoyed my time with it, because the things that id gets right are the things that tend to matter in their games. You're getting a polished combat system, with plenty of nice guns and tons of enemies to shoot them at. You're even getting a small open-world to enjoy, even though there's not all that much to do in it aside from drive around, shoot other cars and occasionally pop in for a quick match of Bash TV. There's a bit more to do in the towns and those are the activities that will take up much of your time. The quests are the major flaw here, being generally uninteresting and uninspired. Rage is still id's most underrated game, and while its flaws will be apparent to you as you play through it, there's some good, solid stuff here that makes for an enjoyable experience.  "

												The best way I can sum up Rage is... if you are interested in playing Rage, you've already played this game. It is the next generic post-apocolypse shooter. It's like the sampler appetizer that has just a little bit of pieces of other games. However, this is the best looking of these games. Some of the textures look like total crap, but some areas and vistas look very nice. The game does take a lot of hard drive space for a fairly short game. Overall, it wasn't bad. It took around 13 hours to finish. The story is generic. Most of the combat is done in linear corriders. I didn't care for the hit detection when shooting enemies. Shoot them once and you gotta wait to shoot them again or the hit won't register. A lot of bullets and time were wasted having to wait through the AI recovery  god frame animations so the next bullet will register. Most of the exploration is done with vehicles that let you travel the map. I'd recommend getting Rage if it's on sale and you want some mindless fun. It is unremarkable in every way, but I still managed to have some fun with it.			"

												Personal Rating: 6 of 10Good graphics but linear and repetative gameplay and story. There are almost zero customization in the game except for fixed weapons and vehicles upgrades and ammo types. Do take note that this is a ported game from console and its really buggy with choppy graphics specially when running on ATI graphics card. There are some alternatives out there but it won't resolve the issue completely. If you are looking for the Anarchy Edition, try third party legitimate website for the DLC pack.			"

												The Short: An unsuccessful blend of genresThe Long:With a setting very much like Fallout 3, RAGE instead focuses on being a straight 3D Shooter (not surprisingly given that it’s an id-game) and throws in some fancy driving/racing for good measure. But all these elements never quite gel. The driving feels very much like an afterthought to amp up the game (or an attempt to channel Mad Max 2) but not only does this feel like a separate game within the game (which the racing basically is) but it very much sabotages any kind of open world feeling games like Fallout 3 offer, since you don’t explore the world, you simply drive through it … fast!Also the pacing of the campaign is terrible. It’s basically the concept of a linear shooter disguised as a RPG quest system. The player is rushed from one mission to the next. There are few side quests, mostly lazily designed by revisiting a previous location playing it backwards from end to start the second time. RPG elements are rudimentary and never quite pay off.Characters are superficial and you never get emotionally invested in their stories or fates. But at least the voice acting is fairly good.The storyline is badly constructed. Starting from the initial point from the player being rescued by Hagar just to be send out again to do missions, over establishing the faceless Authority (which way too  much looked like Half-Life 2’s Combine troops) as villains before even properly explaining what makes them villainous, to shoving the player towards joining a Resistance he knows little about. As in fact the whole background of this world is never properly established.On the bright side the game looks very good and plays quite well as a shooter. The locations are well designed, with a decent amount of attention to detail.In my opinion the game would have been better had it focused on being a 3D Shooter. Driving could still have been part of the game, but in a way harmonious to the gameplay (e.g. like Far Cry 2 - as mediocre as that game was).The way it is RAGE pretends to be more than it is and fails on living up to that pretense. It’s not a bad game, but playing it leaves one disappointed because it promised more than it delivered. The ending is also fairly unsatisfactory, but I assume the developers pretty much envisioned it with some ""RAGE 2"" in mind. In a better game it would have disappointed me. Here I really didn't care.			"

												Rage is a game that does a lot right but has enough frustrating elements to keep it from truly achieving greatness.  The weapons are satisfying, enemy encounters are fun, and the presentation is great but it's wrapped around a terrible semi-open world progression and bland car combat.  I would have preferred Rage if it was just a linear corridor shooter because the combat is so much more enjoyable than all the vehicle and hubworld exploration segments.			"

General ThoughtsInteresting little FPS.  I did enjoy playing, however there were a few things that drive me a little batty.  There was an interesting story that ended aburptly right when it was getting good.  Once completeled I was left with a feeling of, ""That's It?!?""  While the game is visually stunning, it did suffer from some issues like LOD popup constantly.  Thankfully these can be 99% eliminated with custom configs.  All in all I had fun playing the game.  I just wished for a more climatic ending.The Good Solid Shooting Mechanics Quest Driven Storyline Adaptive AI Plenty of Eye Candy Caters to multiple playstyles Plenty of timesink distractions (minigames, racing, gambling to name a few) Rewards explorationThe Bad Story Abruptly Ends Funky graphic issues (mostly fixable with custom configs) Crazy economy.   You'll consistently be dumping your earnings into ammo. Vehicles a bit wonky for keyboard/mouse controls.  Controller recommended. "

Get object from here and give to guy. Go to dungeon kill enemys. Etc. The story is simple. Emerge from vault/ark/bunker thing and help people.

												I like this game. It is a few years old now but the graphics are still fairly good overall. Overall it is a first-person shooter style game, but they added in a driving/racing aspect that not only seems to work fairly well, but to me adds a degree of realism to a post-apocolyptic world that so many other games seem to lack. And unlike some other games, while you can just walk around out on the main map; taking the buggy or the monarch to drive around definitely gets you there both faster and safer. There is a good amount to do in this game aside from the main quest line in the form of side quests and challenges, as well as several easter eggs from the older id software games that are just kinda cool to collect.Now for the bad. Thw game is fairly linear overall. You can miss out on things by progressing the main storyline too far too fast, and I'm not a big fan of that in open-world games. It's not too bad as long as you do optional side quests first then the main 1 but on initial playthrough it might not be obvious. Also, might just be because I'm late to the party, as in I did not buy this game when it was brand new, but there is never anybody on the multiplayer side of this so I can't unlock the rest of my acheivements. not a huge deal, but a little disappointing.Overall, like I said, I really do enjoy the game. I would rate the overall experience as about a 7 out of 10. Definitely worth trying.			"

												I acquired RAGE on a sale, and for the price I paid, I'd recommend the experience.  The world is gorgeous, in a post-apocalyptic, Fallout-like style, with some obvious Fallout-like ripoffs.  Still, it's worth it just to experience some of the really immersive visuals.  The characters and people are reasonably good, beautifully crafted, fully voiced with a variety of personalities (even if some of the acting is forced).  Also, the first ""Dead City"" experience was really memorable.The game is largely good, but suffers from a lack of direction and from trying to do & to be too much.  The crafting system is interesting and provides some value, but largely unnecessary to complete the game.  The various minigames, too, are value-added, but in the same way that finding spare change in your pocket is value-added.  The vehicles actually drive very nicely and are enjoyable, and the vehicular combat isn't bad, but the entire racing circuit side-game is virtually mandatory and--as such--is a detriment.The game is arguably broken up into three sections, by ""hub"".  The first and third sections are really short, while the second is probably over-long.  The first section, being short, makes sense.  Its an intro to the game; the starting quest hub.  The brevity of the third hub, however, and the entire third section of the storyline--including the anticlimactic end stage and ending--feels shockingly unfinished, especially compared with some real gems in the section section (Wellspring), most notably the first visit to the Dead City.Ultimately, I'd recommend the game, if only to experience the first half to two-thirds of it.

												The name of the game aptly describes the feeling I felt during installation and during the ending of the game. Putting aside the hassle that was installing a bunch of graphics drivers to play the actual game that almost broke my old computer, the game itself was okay, and had some interesting ideas. Despite that though, the game was rather short, and the ending was very much unsatisfying.			"

												dont buy this game, first review ever, took me hours to fix graphic bugs and make this somewhat playable(my hardware is 3x as good as the recommended one..) only so that after 20min into the game it wouldnt recognizemy keyboard any more and i had to stop playing it... seems like more ppl have those problems since they game is primarly programmed for consoles ----> x360 controller would probably solve the issue but im no PC gamer for nothin....

												In my opinion, Rage isn't so bad, for the price at least ($4.99 Discount) ($9.99 Original price). The game suffers greatly from pop-ins, boring story, and stiff gameplay. For some reason lowering the graphic settings seems to help simmer down the pop in issues for me. The FPS combat aspect is fun but still lacking. The enemies' movements are pretty cool, but you as the player, your movements are very poor in comparison.If the player had the abilities to evade and maneuver more like or similar to the enemies it would be a great asset to the gameplay. I haven't gotten far into the story, but I can tell you now it isn't something great. While the beginning shows something unique it quickly starts to fall bland and boneless. So far it has been missions such as:""Go to this person and get something.""OH, that person's something has been stolen. ""Go to a Raider's camp and retrieve it.""There is no actual Open world, everything is oddly convenient. Also, you can't pick up enemy weapons and gear. The game is very, very, basic. Which is unfortunate, it had potential. Rage has a Mad Max feel to it, you can race with your buggy and combat enemies with mounted weapons, but sadly the world just isn't open enough to justify it. This game is simply nothing exciting, but truth is I'm enjoying the game for what it costs. I would say give the game a try if it's on discount. I wouldn't recommend paying $10 as for this game honestly doesn't feel like a $10 game.Final Rating: 6/10 Could've been much better.			"

												Seriously... BORING UNEVENTFUL STORY.I actively wished the entire game to have a CHOICE in ANYTHING, especially being able to side with the so-called 'authority' because they got cool armor and seemed to have some sembelance of an idea what the hell they were doing.I do not recommend this game for someone who wants:1) A good storyline with a thorough ending.2) Interesting characters you can interact with3) An open worldAdditionally, if you DO NOT want the following; beware:1) Racing is REQUIRED in the main storyline. (I do okay in racing games and was able to complete them, but I do not like them)2) a couple mini bosses but no real skill requirement to fight anything3) Endless random vendor trash to sell for no apparent reason.4) Endless ammo if you so choose.5) Enemies which while having some intelligence, still seem to put their back to you when you throw a grenade at them. (seriously, just watched 2 people run around cover and turn to face the grenade with me looking at them... smart.)6) A lack of 'fun guns' to play with. Ultimately, I ended up using the shotgun almost the entire game because using 'Pop Rockets' (grenade ammo) is simply the only weapon I found enjoyable, side for shooting mutants with an assault rifle and then slamming them in the face with melee. (other than this, wingsticks were my only other weapon choice)-Some BACKGROUND:I played RAGE originally back in 2012 and after getting bored with it, I stopped playing. This was after about 2 hours of the game and I had not completed the game.Then, again in 2014 I picked up the game again (figuratively) and played past the part I stopped at previously. Again, I became bored out of my mind and uninstalled it.Finally, in 2016 I finished it.Yes, I was bored with an id game. Three times now. I only beat the game to prove I could and... dear god it was still a waste of my time. (Surprisingly, yes I always enjoyed Doom 1,2 and 3, also played the original wolfenstein games and commander keen. So, I love id and I think they have a great staff.)Sadly, this game has dissappointed me greatly. When I first picked it up, read the cover and thought back to the trailers; I said ""My, this would rock if it's anything like what is described."" That is simply not the case.I was hopeful of a Fallout3/NewVegas with a doom atmosphere, because out of everything I want a survival horror wasteland game if I can get one. (Even if doom is a bit shooty ;-)Regardless, this game at first tries to fool you. It gives you quests, loot drops, corpses to desecrate and thereby steal gear from; but ultimately none of it matters. On top of all this; characters all spew dialog for long enough to make me decide to step away from my desk to grab a snack while they yammer, before I can actually get a quest or shop from them.If you want to jump into a shooter and just blow people and mutants up, it can be fun. I won't deny that. But ultimately, I have stopped playing it two other times because some areas are just so unbelievably boring.A final thought, the higher you crank the difficulty the higher enemy HP is. (very annoying as that is the only noticable difference)			"

												RAGE is a great FPS.You get a good mix of fun and interesting guns.  Very good enemy AI, with good variation to the enemies. Great graphics and sound.Interesting characters with good voice acting and animation.  Fun 3rd person battle-racing, in upgradable car.I enjoyed all the exploration and side quests.Has Co-op outside the main campaign (missions are co-op only).Recommended for all FPS fans.			"
