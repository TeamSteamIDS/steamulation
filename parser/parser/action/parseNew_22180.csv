												Since I'm in a reviewing mood I thought I'd write a review about this game. Honestly, I really wish there was a ""Meh"" button for reviews instead of giving it a Positive or Negative because that's exactly what this game is, however I'm leaning towards Yes so I'll give a positive review.Penumbra Overture is the first in the series, the game after this is Penumbra : Black Plague and you have an additional game which is Penumbra : Requiem which is just a puzzle-solving one. These games are surrounded in horror, puzzles and story telling. Length/Replay Value	First thing that pops in to my mind when I'm purchasing a game is the actual length of the game and how much replay value it has. I purchased this game at the end of 2014 and didn't really touch it up until this day where I managed to finish it in pretty much one sitting. This game on average will take around 5-6 hours to complete... yes I said it... 5-6 HOURS! To me, I think that a horror game such as this deserves much more time to it. Is this game one I can go back and play? Not really. Maybe in a few years since I finished Penumbra : Black Plague a few years ago and now I've got the urge to play it again but other then that there isn't really anything to do in the game. No collectibles or anything like that. Just a game which requires you to avoid dogs, solve puzzles and be trapped in some creepy atmospheric mine. The replay value just isn't there. Graphical	The game was released in 2007 and still looks pretty damn good considering it was released almost TEN years ago! Of course, it won't be as good as modern day games but for it's time I would have said that this game was great and it still is! Gameplay	The game itself is actually very immersive, the music is creepy which really adds to the scary atmosphere and you are stuck underground in mines/caves with flesh eating dogs after you, massive worms and caves full of spiders, solving puzzles and trying to survive. Sounds cool right? Weeelllll... the game does start off great, the first time you enter the mine and hear the sound of a dog really does shake you up! But as the game progresses you realise that there is a lot of repetition that is used. You see, throughout this game there are sections where the level layout is very identical... similar looking corridors and mines which branch off different ways to different rooms which require you to go to in order to get specific items to progress and  using them specific items to open a ""locked door"" in one of the corridors. It gets boring after a while and what makes it even more boring is that the monsters that roam the corridors/mines are just dogs. In the caves there are spiders and there is a part with a worm but we're talking corridor/mine sequences... pure dogs. Unlike Black Plague where that had the Tuurngait [http://penumbra.wikia.com/wiki/Tuurngait_Infected], this one had dogs that you had to constantly avoid and could easily be avoided by throwing beef jerky around and locking them in cages. The Tuurngait actually carried flashlights in some stages and could see you in the dark, the dogs couldn't do that. I went through the game without getting spotted by a dog once because all I did was wait corners and wait for them to pass. That's another thing that annoyed me, Dogs are supposed to have really good noses and be able to smell stuff better than a human can yet they couldn't smell a sweaty guy trapped in a mine who was sneaking behind them or right around a corner, staring them in the face? SCARE Factor	Now this is a hard one, I don't know if it's because I'm getting older but games don't seem to scare me as much anymore unless it's a jumpscare but we all know they're no good in a horror game master-piece. Amnesia seemed to get it right. Back on point, this game had no jumpscares but was actually quite creepy when I played it briefly in 2014. If hiding from dogs, running from spiders and worms is your cup of tea then good! The atmosphere was kinda creepy? Personally though, this game didn't really have me scared or on the edge of my seat, If I was to rate it out of 10 on scare factor I would give it a 3.5/10 OVERALL	The game itself is quite an  interesting game to sit down and play if you're in to puzzle solving and a slight bit of horror at the same time. It isn't that long and isn't on the edge of your seat scary so if you're someone with a weak heart and who hates scary games then this may be for you! Would I say it's worth it's price? Yeah. However, Black Plague was scarier in my opinion. :)			"

												This is the game that changed the horror genre once and forever. It became the point of no return. This is indie low-budget game that influenced the industry up to AAA blockbusters. Outlast, Daylight, Alien Isolation, all these run-and-hide horror type games grew up from Penumbra and tried to evolve its mechanics in some way or another with no doubt. Nevertheless this game started it all, started so called new golden age of horror games.			"

												Penumbra: Overture is the first in a series of horror games released in early 2007. While the developers like to class this as a first person adventure game, I would also say there is quite a lot of elements of survival horror and psychological horror. The game uses a game engine called Newton Game Dynamics which is known for it's physical and realistic simulations. The adventure portion of the game focused a lot on physics based puzzles as well as a physics based combat system (i'll get more into that later). You can also play a lot of this game as stealthy as possible. The AI in Overture is well coded and respond realistically to noises and light.  There are also no guns or fire arms so your combat mechanics are based around manual weapons such as hammers and pick axes. The combat system is the one aspect that I disliked to begin with; it is very hard to control as you actually have to swipe your mouse in the movement you would like to hit the enemy. It can sometimes get very confusing and you may end up turning your camera 180Â° without wanting to, then getting smacked in the back of the head, which at times can be the difference between life and death.  I found I was able to get to grips with the technique eventually, it just took a lot of actual conscious thinking when I needed to use it. It's certainly not a mechanic I would like to see implemented in other games, at least not in this form. Your main focus when playing is on exploration and classic  adventure game object and item interactions.  Most of the puzzles require searching for keys or other objects which can be placed in another object, such as batteries or motors. All of the puzzles resolution can all be found in the game; there are no wacky puzzles that are really impossible to work out. Clues can be found in books and letters, which again are found all over the game. The game is split into four chapters, each of these chapters has one ""big"" puzzle which may stump you for a while, they normally involve some sort of maneuvering of some kind, for instance my favorite is a steam pump floor and you have to memorize the pattern in which steam is pumped out of the floor, that puzzle alone takes a ton of thinking and memory skills to progress. Graphically, Overture looks like a 2007 game, this is not a bad thing - it's just very dated. At the time this would of been a very good looking game. There are however fan made texture mods which make the game look amazing, and if you are confident in installing these type of mods, I would highly recommend giving it a try. As with most horror games, the music and audio plays a massive role in Penumbra. Like I said at the start, this game has a lot of physiological horror elements. At times there isn't actually anything physically to be scared of, however the music tempo changes and suddenly you start hearing thumping sounds, then all of a sudden you are on the edge of your seat wanting to throw your headset on the floor. Penumbra does the audio side of things brilliantly; in fact if you we to play the game without sound on at all, it wouldn't even be remotely scary. The story mode of Penumbra took me about four hours to complete, which is a solid amount of time for a adventure game like this and I was ultimately happy with the conclusion. Luckily you don't have to pay for each of the games in the series individually, so the price for all three is very well compromised with the length of the game. I didn't have any technical issues with the game either, the game runs at a silky smooth 60 fps, and can be played at full higher resolutions which is always nice to see from older games. If you are a fan of the horror and/or the adventure genre of games, you will certainly find alot of enjoyment in Penumbra. This is certainly a series that I am looking forward to playing the next installments of in the future. If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Ah, Frictional Games' first-ever.It's definitely a great horror game for beginning horror lovers. Its atmosphere is dark and menacing, and in general it functions well enough to be both a game and a trip through Hell. It's not too hard, and it's too traumatizing, either. It's a good medium for fun and scares alike.However, this is Frictional Games' weakest game, too. There is only one thing that truly spoils the horror and gameplay in this beauty, and if you don't know this, then it doesn't matter. Otherwise, if you want to enjoy the game without spoiling the feel, don't read the following. This is only a gameplay issue which makes the game trivial if you know it. Again, if you do not know this game and have the slightest idea of playing it, you should not read the following:The main enemy of the game, the undead dogs, aren't truly a threat at all. In all other of Frictional Games' games, monsters cannot be hurt and you are forced to avoid them. However, in this game, the only two monsters -- dogs and spiders -- can be killed. The spiders you are meant to kill; however, you are obviously meant to be stealthy and undetected by the dogs, but the problem is that you can kill them far too easily by simply stun-locking them with melee strikes of a pickaxe or hammer (which, somehow, do the same damage). In addition, they have bad hit detection, and you can sometimes kill them while standing on something just barely above their reach -- even a wall railing you can jump on. When you know how weak the actual horrors are in this game -- even on hard mode -- then all the stealth and threatening atmosphere that was intended for these dogs just becomes a face-mashing party. In my first run through this game, I didn't know the above and I enjoyed the game well. However, after playing it a second time with the above knowledge, I got bored before even getting a quarter into the game because it felt no longer like a horror game.In short:It's a great horror game for beginners if you don't advantage yourself with knowing a few of the game's functional faults. However, if you're already too familiar with such, then you should probably start with another of Frictional Games' better works.			"

												Would you like to know what was before Amnesia? If yes, Penumbra is for you as you have a chance to see the first survival horror game of Frictional Games.Although not as terrifying, Penumbra Overture is still a relatively scary and interesting game where you pick up the story of Philip who has just arrived to Greenland to find his father based on the mysterious letter he'd received from him. To make it even more interesting: Philip had always thought his father had been dead.The game puts emphasis on physics-based puzzle solving and physics based combat. Combat would be a bit harsh as usually the best thing to do is to run and other than a pickaxe or hammer we will not have any weapons at our disposal. Now, similarly to Amnesia, the protagonist has his own notepad where he writes his thoughts so this is how the story will gradually progress. While somewhat short, Penumbra showed something new in this genre and those who liked the Amnesia games should definitely give this one a try.			"

												Forget Amnesia, this is Frictional Games' underappreciated child that needs more recognition. Compared to Amnesia: The Dark Decent, this game brings more feelings of terror, two-fold the amount Amnesia had on me. In Penumbra, you cannot just run and hide from a situation to make everything okay, in most instances you are faced with a challenge to complete all while being stalked by a demon dog or infected crazies, which can be extrememly overwhelming. The storyline is intruiging, and the visuals are pretty good for a low-budget horror game. The monster AI can be a bit stupid at times, but it doesn't really take away from how terrifying they are. This is a game you will truly find yourself immersed in, and I would recommend it to any horror game fanatic (who doesn't already own it).9/10			"

												The best horror game I've ever played. Most of these days games rely on jump scares to temporally tug away at the player and is something there for twitch streamers and such. Penumbra will always hold a heart in my place where true horror, scare, and story blend in together.My father, Howard, abandoned me before I was even born. And here I go following his footsteps, but this time, I won't make the same mistakes. That's all I know...If you are going to play this game, avoid killing things. It makes things boring, and attacking is entirely removed in its sequels. Focus on avoiding and running away.I swear, I've never muttered to myself ""I'm so damn lonely"" in a game except this one. Its atmosphere is too great. Never seeing a single human being, only hearing someone, and your character's thoughts (which suspciously relate too much with me. maybe it's an edgy thing with me)You're tucked away at some old abandoned mine with almost no hope to escape and you're not even sure why you're there in the end.

 The most important fact here is Penumbra isn't a Amnesia game!Originally posted by Frictional Games:Penumbra: Overture is a first person survival horror game, emphasizing on survival and problem solving instead of mindless violence and gore. One of the best survival horror games i've ever played...I love the Survival Horror style, but i'm so bad when i play puzzle games,  in Penumbra Overture we have a quite simple  puzzles (Don't worry) . Most of them consist of finding a way into locked rooms  and discovering notes left by former occupants, and using clues left in the notes to make machines work or to put together various paraphernalia to aid in your escape. Remember... You must read the notes, because they are very important to understand the story!I think Overture it's the best of all three games in the Penumbra series, because are so nostalgic when i play it. If you played Amnesia, there is a chance you'll like this game, because Overture is ancestor of The Dark Descent.You play the game from a first person perspective, utilizing the ''WASD'' buttons for movement, and various keyboard keys for additional actions. You can use the mouse for specialized and realistic interaction with objects in the game. Quoting from the manual, âAlmost all interaction in Penumbra behaves in a physically realistic mannerâ¦You grab an object by pressing and holding down (the left mouse button). To let the object go, just release the same button.â (just like Amnesia)Note: Be careful, your game is automatically saved when you reaches checkpoints, or when you click on artifacts (special items). To finish, i really recomend this game if you appreciate a simple game who can give to you a special experience using puzzles and the Survival Horrors mechanisms.			"

												By removing the Shooter element from the FPS, 'Penumbra' created an eerie FIRST PERSON SURVIVAL PUZZLE genre that surprisingly features some unexpected, nicely paced, action sequences without any direct combat from time to time. You can actually melee some foes or trap them but you'll most likely just sneak past them in the dark (unless you're being swarmed by spiders). The interface is mostly a point and click plus, where not only you get to combine elements to make your way through doors and passageways in endless halls and corridors, you also get to interact with the environment in 3D (with the occasional frustration of not turning a wheel quite right to open a hatch or not thrusting a rock hard enough to break something). It's indie games like this that paved the way for something like 'Alien Isolation' and it's still today one of the coolest games out there with a great storyline and level design. In some ways I prefer this to 'Amnesia', specially because here the dark is your friend and doesn't drive you mad like in the later game (A mechanic that was introduced in order to force you to use lights as if it was food, to recharge your sanity).

												Penumbra: Overture is a first-person survivor horror game with problem solving puzzles implemented in the gameplay which focuses more on survival and eerie atmosphere rather than action and gore. It is also the first episode of the trilogy.The story centers on Philip, a 30-year old physicist, who gets a strange letter from his supposedly dead father shortly after his mother dies. This gives Philip the inceptive to follow his fatherâs clues, leading him to an abandoned mine in Greenland where he eventually gets trapped in after the mineâs entrance collapses behind him. From then on, Philip ventures through a series of events which turn out creepier with each new discovery he makes. Soon he realises that the mine is not just any ordinary mine. More importantly, it is not actually abandoned. The mine is in fact the habitat of ferocious mutated dogs, ârock wormsâ and spiders. Creepy crawly spiders.Surprisingly, the game has an intriguing story even if its premise of searching for your lost father as a plot device has been done numerous times before. Perhaps that is due to the fact that the story, or maybe its narrative, is actually pretty well-written. Generally, most of the story is being unravelled as the player discovers more lost documents and journals from various people who worked in the mine but died in the end in various circumstances. This may require quite a bit of reading to understand what and why things are happening that way (although some things are still left unanswered by the end), so it is important not to have a short attention span. Additionally, when a particular survivor by name of âRedâ makes his first appearance, things seem to get even more interesting from a plot stand-point, in a way reminiscent of Andrew Ryanâs debut in Bioshock.The gameâs mechanics primarily focus on point and clicking with some ""mouse swinging"" when solving puzzles and small occasions of combat mixed in. Although some puzzles may require a lot of thinking than others, they are by and large well implemented. Unfortunately, there are times when backtracking is required which may or may not become annoying in time. Furthermore, the game does allow you to hide behind objects and block doors to prevent hostile enemies from seeing or approaching you respectively, thus creating a pretty basic but functional stealth mechanic.Penumbra: Overture also boasts a great sound design with its spine-chilling ambient music and close attention to details such as foley sounds, as well as having a memorable soundtrack -- the title soundtrack shall always remain a favourite of mine. Sound design is crucial for horror games like Penumbra: Overture, and it is reassuring to see that the developers did a fine job here.Graphically, while the art direction is commendable, the game did not age too well by todayâs standards. The animations are rough and stiff most of times, particularly for the dogs. But in most parts, the aesthetics do achieve in creating the spooky environment the developers envisioned.The major downside of the game is its combat mechanic. Just like the way you have to approach the doors, drawers or switches in the game, the combat here requires âswingingâ the mouse which is extremely clunky and requires a lot of practice before getting the grips with it. Sadly, the experience generally ends up being always infuriating for every single hit stupidly missed by your pickaxe (arguable the main combat weapon). This is why any combat should be avoided as much as possible in this game, at all costs. On top of that, there seems to be a lack of variation in enemies too.Conclusively, Penumbra: Overture is a game which excels in creating an authentic horror experience with genuine eerie atmosphere and plenty of mystique, along with well thought-out puzzles and an unexpected interesting story, only let down by its combat mechanic and roughness from a technical perspective. Being a relatively short game (so long as you do not âwasteâ time standing in one spot due to fear), it has the perfect length and pace. It may not be the most impressive horror game out there on the surface, but it is one which horror enthusiasts must try thanks to its unique approach and emphasis on atmosphere and less on combat which differentiates itself from the masses of generic and/or action-oriented horror games; in addition to paving the way to future superior, if not the best, horror games such as Amnesia: The Dark Descent or even Overture's follow-up episode, Black Plague.

 ""Every time, itâs harder to pull out. Every time, I feel more of myself inside.â Penumbra: Overture represents the first of three episodes in the Penumbra series. The game offers an immersive horror atmosphere with interesting puzzles and a very strong storyline, which continues straight into the sequel Penumbra: Black Plague. The only disadvantage of the game is the stiff and sometimes frustrating combat system. Therefore, stealth should be prioritized over combat. Achievements: The game has no Steam achievements.			"

												Penumbra:  Overture ReviewIt's all right.  I wouldn't call it a horror game however, as it's more of an adventure/exploring game with spooky stuff rather than horror.  The story is interesting enough to keep you engaged, although you're gonna have to play all three games.  You play as some dude who gets caught up in some mysterious family drama and ends up in an abandoned mine somewhere in the middle of nowhere.  It's been overrun by mutated animals, giant spiders (of course) and worms big enough to rival the Alaskan Bull Worm from Spongebob.As you progress you'll do the typical look-around, combine items, solve situational puzzles, kill a few enemies, etc.  The game basically plays as one big map instead of levels, so unless you know exactly where you're going you're gonna get lost and frustrated.  Certain things won't even activate until you do something else in a completely different area and you won't exactly get a hint.  I used a walkthrough most of the playthrough which helped tremendously, and I didn't feel that it took away from the experience, in fact it was kind of fun for whatever reason to play with the walkthrough.You'll collect notes strewn about that range from diary entries to data logs and such; they give you a sense of what happened in the mine and you'll quickly realize that something went very wrong.  You'll also (after getting a radio) get these messages from a guy named Red who is evidently trapped somwhere in the mine.  He will lead you throughout the game until its end.  I should also mention that this game is rather short.  Don't be fooled by my playtime hours as I've played it across two computers (got halfway and reset).  So I do recommend it, and although it markets itself as a horror game don't expect too much horror, just enjoy the experience casually.			"

												The first game by Frictional Games, Penumbra stands as the strong debut of the devs. Although the combat system is clunky, and the mechanics feel a bit unrefined at times, Penumbra is still a great game that contributed to the more polished and sp00ku Amnesia : The Dark Descent. Both Overture and Black Plague are able to hold their own, with plots that are connected, yet both games give off their own distinct feel. If you're late to the party, (like I,) and haven't bought a copy of the Penumbra Trilogy, you're seriously missing out on sp00ku.			"

												My recommendation: Try it/Get it on sale.Pros and Cons:+ Great atmosphere+ Interesting puzzles- Small variety of enemies- Not as scary as some of the later games from FrictionalYou play as Philip, a 30 year old physics teacher. After his mother's funeral, he receives a letter from his father, who has been presumed dead ever since Philip's birth. In his letter, he asks Philip to destroy certain cryptic documents, but out of curiosity, Philip decides to do some research and finds out the location of a mine in Greenland. He then goes on to investigate the mine on his own, which is where the game begins.Penumbra Overture is a blend of survival horror, psychological horror, and adventure game. You will solve puzzles to progress further, while avoiding and outsmarting enemies. While there is a combat system, the game encourages you to be stealthy and cautions. Combat is pretty clunky and ineffective, mainly because Philip is just a regular guy, not an action hero. Puzzles are interesting and done well, but I did get stuck once or twice (however, I was never good at puzzle games anyway).What makes this game shine is its atmosphere, sense of tension, immersion and isolation. Mysterious story only enhances that, but since this is the first episode in the series, not much is explained. Most of the information comes from notes lying around the place, and you better read them if you want to get the full back-story of the area.In the terms of technical features, the graphics and sounds are solid and do the job, and the physics engine works well. Level design is decent, but since you are in a mine expect to see a lot of similar areas. Voice acting is not the best, but it's not cringe worthy either. Music is pretty good, it really keeps the tension going on and improves the overall atmosphere. Because of the nature of the game the AI is not that complex and that's perfectly fine - enemies patrol the area and if they spot you, they'll chase you.My complaints would be that after some time, enemies started to annoy me and get in my way. Probably because the enemy variety is pretty weak - there are only three different types of them and two of them are encountered only once or twice. Also, I didn't find this game really scary, especially in comparison to some of the later games from Frictional.Overall it's a solid game, worth your time if you're a fan of adventure games with horror elements. It does a good job of setting up the basis for the series.Click here to read my Penumbra: Black Plague review.More reviews on my Tumblr page[megaskylight.tumblr.com] "

												Got this pack once when it was on discount on a Steam Sale. Had never heard of these games before so it was a risk buy. However I was reall susprised how difficult it is. You are not given much clues or tutorials and you literally are on your own, thrown into the story. And this is something I really like. It's not dumbed down but the game actually expects you to THINK and use your brain and interact with the environment and the objects you find. It is quite hard but if you like challenges you'll be pleased.  Plus the atmosphere is really good.And the best thing is it is available for LINUX too :D Which is where I play it (haven't checked the Windows version yet).So if you're using Steam OS or playing under a different Linux Distribution, I can absolutelly recommend these games.

												Back to 2006 where I first bought retailed version of Penumbra Collection.Frictional Games started to release one of most intense/psychological horror first person game which become the trend for many FPS type horror. But what does, it's not about jumpscare. Penumbra introduces player with questions and goal of Phillip. Even there's no character development, the most the time each piece of his answer is revealed during playthrough. Overture still left many questions as it's first episode of series.The solid parts of Penumbra are atmosphere and puzzle. Plain map designs but feels uncomfortable and hopeless. The puzzles play as major role of the game. It's fun, creative and encourage player to think outside the box and learn from environment. The combination of point-and-click with real time interaction are well executed. However, when it comes to combat the player don't have much choice beside guarding position and spam your weapon due to clumsy control.Penumbra: Overture is small, interactive fun and left you with some intense moment and storyline.I enjoy everytime I picked it back in action.

												The first episode to Frictional's survival horror franchise that put them on the map.  This series, much like Amnesia, is a true blue example of how horror is done in gaming, only this series gains points of not having an arbitraty sanity meter, but then loses those points for an awful combat system that thankfully, is optional half the time.  The puzzles in the game are a nice relief from fetching â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ly designed slabs of stone to be placed inside indentations in walls and are actually solved through common, real world sense, such as just plain smashing that locked chest open with a rock using the dynamic click and drag world interaction system.  Finally, the story is compelling, and you'd be surprised how much you'll find yourself caring for the only support character you meet, even if he's just a voice over a battered old radio.  If you're a horror fan and are sick of the uneventfulâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥that's passing for horror these days, you owe it to yourself to catch up on this series!			"

												Amazing atmosphere as usual in Frictional games! This game here is iconic for the whole horror-game community because of how early it was made. If you're a fan of horror games and don't mind a bit outdated graphics, this is a must buy just for you to see what horror games were back then. If you want a really scary game from the same developers buy Amnesia: The Dark Descent! For an amazing story, buy S.O.M.A.! But buy this game just to see where it all started... (not really the first horror game but the first Very good one at It's time.) Thanks Frictional Games for still being here making more and more awesome horror games every time..			"

												Time to completion - 5 hours.Penumbra Overture is an Amnesia-like game (from the makers of Amnesia. It was their first game).  It is a bit different though. The story basically involves your father who had been gone your entire life leaving you a note after his death. This leads you to a location to investigate. The game is a mix of exploration, item colelction, and combat. It is really like on combat, which is good because the combat is the weakest part of the game. You wont be fighting any supernatural crazy things. I wont say more, because I dont want to spoil it. The game is good.Pros: - Great atmosphere and sense of place.- Good level design- None of the puzzles are crazy difficult- Story is interestingCons:-Combat is akward. LIke press mouse button and then ""Swing"" the mouse.- There were one or two places i had to lookup some brief guidance. - Ends on kind of a cliffhanger.			"

												Penumbra is a enjoyable experience for gamers who like puzzles and exploration. Dark, Dank, Dissused mines with Vicious dogs roaming around. Spiders, slugs and worms... urgh! It has a great atmosphere about it and areas are small and quick to progress through. Not too much back-tracking. The Combat isn't great but then it can be avoided with stealth. If you must fight, then use your nogging and find a way to make it easier for you and harder for the enemy. plenty of stuff lying around to make combat quicker and less annoying.The story gets alot more interesting the further in you get, So don't give up!Oh! and play this game with Headphones as it adds to the spookiness.

												I consider Penumbra: Overture to be one of the first 'true' horror games I've ever played. It fascinated me by taking an entirely different approach to the subgenre of survival horror, removing nearly all elements of violence or gore, while concentrating on a terrifying atmosphere and environment. Frictional Games manages to create suspense by solely focusing on the feeling of isolation and helplessness in a most hostile environment. Instead of just throwing one jumpscare after another at you, Penumbra plays with the fear of the unknown, and knows exactly at which time to strike. This combined with the puzzles and sophisticated physics engine ensure a perfect pacing between tense and relaxed parts. The music and sound design is remarkably well done for an indie game and can compare to genre classics like Silent Hill without doubt. Penumbra: Overture is a real insiders' tip for me if it comes to survival horror games, and shouldn't be missed by any fan of the genre.			"

												Penumbra: Overture is arguably a prime example to the tired idea of ""It's not how much time, but it's what you do with it."" Throughout the 4 or so hours I took on this first playthrough, I experienced genuine fear as I crawled through the dusty abandoned mine that would set the stage for most of Philip's first chapter. It's not a stretch to call Penumbra: Overture a terrifying game. More terrifying than Amnesia: The Dark Descent and more on the level of Alien: Isolation, Penumbra: Overture makes you dread turning every corner for fear of a flesh-eating dog or deadly spider. The atmosphere is amplified by the well-told story and excellent sound design (especially the soundtrack). The gameplay is also done really well, aside from the half-baked combat system and few difficult moments (like the first spider cave). I will be coming back to Penmubra: Overture for years, but the atmosphere, story, and sound truly sell the game. It may be 5-6 hours long (maybe more depending on how you play), but it's a well spent time.			"

												This game was quite the experience - though I would like to say it was an entirely positive experience, Im not quite sure it falls into that category.  I bought Overture as a part of the Penumbra bundle, and have started Black Plague with skepticism.  To sum up my experience with Overture, it would have to be, ""annoying.""  Though the beginning of the game provided an amount of excitement, it quickly became  borderline unbearable to continue due to the ungodly spiders, the redundant puzzles, the giant rock worm debacle and feeble combat/control system.  I honestly had the premonition, ""I will never play this game again."" roughly ten minutes before completing the game; which was all that I had left to carry good old Phillip past the garbage incinerator and into the, admittedly much improved, world of roving, naked 'grey' alien mutations of the Shelter.  My advice is to find a trustworthy rendition of the storyline of Overture, and then begin playing Black Plague.			"

Enemy animationsThe Bad :A lot of puzzles are very unclear in how to solve them ConclusionIt's obvious this game is showing its age and not just graphically but also in its level and puzzle design.

												Penumbra: Overture is the first game released by Frictional Games, using their proprietary HPL Engine. It's a very dated game, since it was released ten years ago, and you need to keep this is mind if you decide to give it a shot. You'll be exploring an old decaying iron mine which hides some secrets in its depths. The story is interesting but the gameplay falls a bit short after a while, because it gets boring to explore labyrinth-like corridors and to evade the enemies roaming around. The combat is original yet VERY flawed, I never managed to land a single hit with the weapons I found, but an empty oil drum got the work done. That's where the HPL Engine is cool: to whack enemies with whatever stuff you find laying around. The game makes a very clever use of the items you'll be finding around to proceed exploring the mine and the puzzles are fun to solve as well.The graphics aren't anything worth mentioning, other than the excellent dynamic lightning (for 2007 standards) and the atmosphere it manages to set together with the sound effects. I must be getting used to these horror games because I can't say that I was scared at all, but Penumbra can be very unsettling at certain times. Grab it in sale to enjoy how much Frictional has evolved over time. I'll be starting Penumbra Black Plague now and I hope it is as interesting as Overture.			"

												Penumbra: Overture is a very fascinating horror adventure game that takes the player to an uninhabited part of Greenland, into an abandoned mining complex, where the player will experience all kinds of spooky occurences and run into whatever creatures dwell inside. I actually really like it how the player is given the chance to fight the dangers, even though being stealthy is the best option to go with. Or rather, it would be if there were no glitches that the player could take advantage of; the games most commonly met creature can easily be slain by jumping on a crate where it cannot reach you, crouching and hitting it whenever it makes a desperate leap attack towards the player, but to no avail. Also the game seems to crash very often. Then again, thats probably just me skipping puzzles by for example climbing to place x instead of knocking the ladder down with something. Well, lucily those are the only grand minuses of the game that I can think of right now and other than those points, I can't help but recommend this classic to horrorlovers. Why? Because the plot is pretty interesting, the puzzles are semi-challenging and there are parts in the game where you need to think and act quickly in order to survive, this game is basically the daddy of Amnesia: the dark descent.

												A peaceful start, a few puzzles to learn the ropes... The game is set up.Now imagine that lovely background suddenly turns to an oppressing atmosphere, the anxiosity of walking in every corridor, that sensation of being watched or chased, forced to hide, with no clue what's going despite weird stuff happening all around you...Penumbra isn't cheap scary game made of screamers. It is a true psychological horror puzzle game, just like an interactive Hitchcock movie that would be mixed with science-fiction elements. Simple yet terrifying !Probably one of the best horror game available. I totally recommend getting the trilogy!Overture is my favourite episode : truly oppressing, a better setting and more clever puzzles.Black Plague will lead you deeper into the plot, gathering suspense and revelations. Requiem beautifully concludes the game, and puts an end to this psychological horror tale.			"

												Having recently played Thief Gold, I was surprised to find more similarities between the two. Philip isn't much of a fighter, but can sneak pretty damn well. The game manages to surround you with an desolate and eerie atmosphere, as you keep descending ever deeper into the complex systems of the underground mine. The puzzles can also offer a good challenge that will leave you satisfied once you crack it down and the documents, scattered about in the mine, are also fun to read to keep up with the story and your surroundings. The engine to interact with your surroundings is pretty unique, as well.    On the other hand, having heard that Penumbra is a massive scare-fest, it was a big letdown. The only semi-real scare you can have is when you meet the first dog and at the very end of the game, which is also quite abrupt and will remind you that Episode 1 is in the game title for a reason. Once you manage to dispose of a few enemies, the horror part really goes down. For most of the time, you are in complete control of the situation, you can work out the patrolling routes of the monsters and ambush them, instead of the opposite. You can also utilize the terrain and various objects to your advantage.    I would recommend Penumbra: Overture as a good atmospheric adventure/puzzle game, but not horror.			"

												I've never had so much fun running from dogs~!Seriously though, you should buy this game. For this being the first horror game by Penumbra that I know of, it is really good. The combat is a bit weird, and may screw you over at times, but you aren't suppoed to be fighting the enemies to begin with. My favorite part about this game's combat is definitely how you're supposed to use the weapons, swinging your mouse in the direction that you want to swing the hammer or pickaxe. While there isn't much variety in enemies, just spiders in about two or three places while your main enemy will be the dogs, it is still fun to get past them. Your only companion in this game, Red, has dialogue that is amazing from how it can range from Metaphorgotten to just borderline insanity. Personally, I prefer the Penumbra games over Amnesia and am disappointed that the story to these games is finished, although I can see why.If you're into horror games with a side of puzzle-solving, you should get this game.The main menu music is also simply beautiful in my opinion.

												one of the best survival horror/puzzle games i've ever played, highluy recommended. it doesn't treat you like you're stupid and expects you to be able to read, use deductive reasoning and problem solving skills. has a very engaging plot and is sh*t-your-pants terrifying at times. just play it, it's great.

												If you like Amnesia, this is the developer's first game and it lays the foundation for what came later. It shows in a lot of ways, but it is by no means a terrible game.For starters, this is the only game Frictional Games has made that feature weapons and combat. This is a good thing, as Overture's combat is clunky and broken. Swinging requires you hold left click, pull to the left or right to prepare a swing, and then swing in the opposite direction to hit. The hit detection is very short-range and the swing area is small. However, the most commonly encountered enemies (dogs) are easy to kill as you can use boxes to stand out of reach of their attacks and simply stun-lock them with your weapon until they die.The atmosphere is creepy, but all of the story is through notes and you never really encounter anybody else. Aside from some rare jump scares, there's nothing terribly scary because the combat AI is so laughably easy to manipulate. There are spiders in this game, which might make you freak out if you have arachnophobia.Luckily, the game is puzzle-oriented and there are only a handful of areas full of enemies. Most of the puzzles are figuring out a process of doing something such as turning on a generator or determining a four-number door lock by translating it through Morse code. The Morse Code puzzle is probably the most difficult out of the bunch and merely requires a pen and paper (or notepad) to write down possible combinations; all other puzzles involve manipulating objects in your environment and following some written instructions.The story ends on a cliffhanger in Overture, so it's recommended you ALSO play Black Plague, which plays much more like Amnesia: The Dark Descent and has much better story presentation. Requiem is technically the third game in the series but is only tangentially related to the other two.So if you're looking for a horror game that involves atmosphere and puzzles rather than focusing on combat like Condemned or Resident Evil, this is a good place to start. It runs on just about anything at a respectable framerate.			"

												Penumbra: Overture is a very very intresting, fun and immersive game.If you liked Penumbra Black Plagu, Amnesia or horror games with more an aspect of exploration with the threat still there, you'll love it.The best part is that if there are enimes around, the game makes it obvious. It allows the player to actually explore the enviroment!9/10. Spiders are very creepy!			"

Lots of practical thinking and puzzle solving involved as you explore each level collecting useful objects and papers for your notebook that also tell a good story.(you will need a walkthrough for some parts) Environments are very immersive and inhabited by predators that will have you on the edge of your seat as you consider each step.Unique and cleverly designed game that runs smoothly.

												I Dont normally play horror games as I do not get scared by them often.  However, Penumbra: Overture is Different.I thought I would pick this up, just to see what it was like (Also it was Â£1.25 in the Steam Sale). I had no Idea what I was getting myself into....PROS/CONS+A really Tense atmosphere: The atmosphere in the game is spot on. Instead of constant jumpscares the game shoves you into a dark enviroment that will have you jumping at shadows and curling up into a mewling ball in front of your computer.+Sound Design: The sound is immersive and chilling and when you do encounter enemies (Spoiler-dogs) The Nerve-shattering growling will put your hair on end.+Gameplay: You can physically interact with objects and you have to manually open doors by using the mouse button and dragging it around. The puzzles follow the traditional format of itemA+entitiyB=solutionC  and will require you to think logically. You have to manage resources (e.g You have a Flashlight that needs two batteries every hour).+Story: The story is immersive and clever twists and turns will leave you wanting more.+Graphics: Good for a small indie team. -Combat: Unfortunately, this game has a rather clunky combat system. You hold down R and Swing in the general direction of the target with a Pickaxe or Hammer equiped. This is rather annoying in dificult situation as you must stand perfectly still facing the target and if the target is a Mobile, Feral dog the you can expect death. Thankfully, combat is usually never the solution to anything.-Scripted events: The scripted events are annoying as they reqiure you to do certian things in a certian order. For instance, the first spider cave has you crawl through tunnels , blocking off spiders with boulders. You have a limited amount of time to think and what you have to do is unclear without pausing for thought. The worst experience for me was being chased by a Giant Worm through a chemical storage area. You have to close doors with obsucre buttons, bunny hop across a river of Acid, Use the Awful combat system to destroy a fence and finally, knock stupidly placed physics props over to cross yet another Acid River. The cherry on top of this Tarte auâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥was placing a valve next to the exit door only to have it turn very slowly with the solution being unclear (Remeber what I said about time constraints and thinking time). Thankfully these events are Rare in the game.To ConcludeIf you want a very good game that will Scare you and has a great story with nice gameplay and you dont mind the occasional bit of Scripted BS then this is the game for you.

												Penumbra Overture is the first part of Penumbra series, being called Episode One as back then it was planned to make Penumbra a trilogy. Ended up being a duology plus expansion pack. It's a First Person adventure game with horror elements and combat and it was made by Frictional Games in 2007. Yep, same people who made Amnesia, you should feel this one being similar somewhat.Actually, one should note about Penumbra tech demo, which Frictional Games people created to show off their engine. It had similar plot intro as in Penumbra, hero wanting to find answer about his dad in a mine set somewhere in snowy lands, and then you wander around in dark industrial corridors. And then meet a somewhat cute monster who is like a mix of slug and bat. And then solve puzzle. And then in the end get lamely knocked out in a small room covered in blood.And well, it actually excited people enough for developers to consider of making a commerical game based on tech demo. After all, it used physics engine where you was the one dragging things around and being able to manipulate with more detail. Like, you grab a side of valve and then have to circle it around accordingly. And then horror games in First Person weren't widespread back then either.Oh, and people being spooked by the cut enemy.As for how scary this is: Not much. It's not completely realistical and tame, but it doesn't try to screw with your brain with paranormal scares. It just sets of a really dark spooky atmosphere, but once you realize that whatever will be trying to get in your face is just a normal enemy, then well, you will relax. It still can scare you though, in the beggining. I think that game has enough for it going so even those who don't like being scared will feel it's worth playing.And it does feel like a not-high budged episode one of series. It doesn't have much going for it. It's actually repetetive in how it's maze after maze, password after password, note after note. But at least it's still nice to explore and still has lenght of a fine game. Even if it ends on clear cliffhanger. And there are no models for any other human. Even though you will ""meet"" Red. And may like that chap. Who is about as likeable as companion cube.And yea graphics are fine for that time. Does good work with shadows and lighting. Can be muddy. It actually has more than one light source. With one being infinite. Not to mentioning that a lot of areas are well-lit anyway that you don't really have to use them.Yes, it still makes use of that physics engine, which was pretty nice at the time. Though puzzle-solving part of a game feels so disconnect from whatever horror premise. And it's not used as much as one would hope. But hey, it still gives feels. You can feel how heavy the box is when you are dragging it and can't lift it off the ground. Other parts of puzzles makes you combine items like in your everyday adventure game.It also has combat and monsters. Or more exactly - dogs. They usually patrol the main parts of mazes and you find a few tools and items that are used on dogs. They are here to make you sneak and hide around corners of a maze, to make you afraid, with combat system that is clunky. But in short, it gets tedious really fast to go from one point to another point while hiding from them, so I would just murder them. It's actually extremely easy, you can exploit them. Or you can whack them directly and time it so they are pretty much stunlocked. So another flop.But you know, back at 2007 it still was an unique First Person experience. And still is a good fun, even if weaker than the adventure horror games nowdays. Actually, I don't like being scared much, so I enjoyed just having a nice dark atmosphere, exploring and puzzling. Not to mentioning fine music and ambience. And fine pacing at times.			"

												This was one of the scariest games I've played, next to F.E.A.R. and some others. Here's my short review:If you love being scared, exploring and solving logical puzzles, then this game is for you. Most of the time, you will be spending your time avoiding monsters unless you have a handy pick-axe with you.The overall atmosphere is very creepy, especially when those dogs are near. The music intensifies when enemies spot you which gives you a rush of adrenaline.The physics are also cool; you can pick things up and move them around.The story just immerses you with all the text you write in your notebook, the short passages during the loading of the next chapter, and the descriptions that you observe when looking at things around you.Overall, it was atmospheric, and scary. It requires you to use your brain and create objects in order to advance. It also gave me chills continuously. Note: To me, you cannot finish this game in one sitting.8.5/10			"

Penumbra: Oveture is the perfect game in terms of storyline.And that's about it. If you're looking for a ""scary"" game that will leave you shaking, this is not the game (unless you have a phobia towards wolves?) BUT the reason I love this game is because of the storyline. This is where Penumbra: Overture becomes one of my favourite games. You will feel like you're part of the story, you will be immersed and you will finish the game wanting more. I don't care about graphics that much, BUT for a game this old. I will admit that the graphics are pretty good, and you will not have to worry about issues in regards to the age of the game, I managed to get the game working on OS X and Windows without any issues.

												This game does right where all the games that have been trying to copy the Amnesia formula do wrong. Granted that's probably because it's by the same devs who made Amnesia, before they made it, but still. The atmosphere of the abandoned mine is absolutely fantastic, and combined with the music perfectly captures that feeling of being alone, and being watched.The puzzles are nice, you have to actually pay attention and think stuff out, and it doesn't delve into ""just spam every item in my inventory"".Another huge plus for me is the combat. Against more than one enemy you'll easily be overwhelmed, but if you get creative with your approach you stand a fair chance one-on-one, and it's a welcome change from the now-standard ""see monster, hide from monster, wait for monster to leave"" approach horror games tend to use.Finally, the story, or more specifically, the main other character you interact with, is fantastically written, and if you get emotionally invested in your games like I do the twists near the end will hit you like a wrecking ball.

												Whoa, Frictional certainly like their abrupt endings, don't they?  Heh.  However, this one at least has a direct sequel which I'm about to launch into, so perhaps there'll be a satisfying finish to this one yet.     Having now played this in the wake of the also brilliant Amnesia, I have to say...not quite sure why this game's ""spiritual successor"" got so much of the praise, when it's a virtual remake of this in a more ""medieval"" setting?  Sure, Amnesia is perhaps ever so slightly more refined, but it wouldn't exist without this blueprint/""test run"" coming first.  And any game which keeps me in constant suspense with just a handful of feral dogs, some carnivorous fist-sized spiders, and the occasional epic worm is clearly doing SOMETHING right!     In short, if you adored Amnesia you should at least get a kick out of this one, even if you might suffer a slight case of deja vu...and an absolute MUST-HAVE for anyone fascinated with just where the hell The Dark Descent came from.  Underrated!!Verdict: 8.5/10.			"

												I didn't find this game quite as scary as Amnesia, but it is still a good game. The stealth was not done as well as Amnesia, either. Getting around the dogs was surprisingly a piece of cake, only being caught at least 3 times, but you can just hit them, and run away while they go to the other dogs for help, and you'll be all good. The one thing I really hate is the way you attack, having to hold down the mouse button and then move the mouse around. This makes it difficult to stay aiming in the direction you want. If all you had to do was click to swing your weapon, it would make aiming a lot easier. I died a few times because of this problem. I can only hope that Black Plague doesn't have the same thing.And I really hated the part with the chemicals. The labeling of each chemical made no sense, there was nothing giving a hint as to which one was which. I thought the order they were numbered on the paper was the same order as the letters on the vials. I looked through a couple note regarding explosives and chemicals, but they didn't help at all. I had to look up the combination online. I tried to make sense of the labeling of the chemicals, but I just kept seeing people guessing. I still can't find out how it is supposed to make sense, with the numbered order being different than the letter order.But besides that, I still think the game was cool. You should totally play it.

												I bought the Penumbra pack back when Jesus was playing full-back for Jerusalem and made a number of attempts to get into it, but it never really grabbed me for whatever reason. Years later, I found myself in the mood for something a bit different and thought I would take the opportunity to clear some of my backlog. I'm glad I did.The combat system is awkward but you can make it work once you get used to it. The physics are good, and are implemented well into many of the puzzles you will come across. The graphics are solid, not amazing but they get the job done. The audio is fantastic, the skittering of mutant spiders and low growls of zombie dogs gave me goose bumps on many occasions. The story is ok, you will find yourself doing a decent amount of reading but it keeps you interested and steadily builds atmosphere. I played it on Ubuntu 14.04 and it did not skip a beat, it was probably one of the smoothest gaming experiences I have ever had.I thought of it less as a horror game and more as an adventure game that scares the bejeebies out of you. Penumbra Overture is terrifyingly creepy, and I loved every minute of it.			"

												Really excellent game. The combat is atrocious, but it's totally possible to sneak past any enemies without too much hassle. Great story, terrific immersion, and generally a really quality experience that puts you right in the shoes of the protagonist. Despite any graphical or gameplay issues, I had an undeniably good time playing a game that I really couldn't put down for more than a half hour at a time. Highly recommended, and I'll be moving on to the sequel as soon as I finish this review.			"

												I tried playing Amnesia multiple times but was terribly bored and not sacred (though I could never last long enough to get to anything that actually happened I guess). I was afraid that Penumbra: Overture would be similar, but luckily it was not.The graphics are not amazing by any means, but this almost just adds to the creepy atmosphere of the game. In fact, most of the horror elements of the game are just by sheer creep-factor, suspense, and tension alone. The story and atmosphere do most of the work, but they do it pretty well. Combat is a little difficult - weapons are melee-only and swing pretty slowly. Weapons movements are not very fluid, but once you get used to it it's not terrible. Overall, it's worth playing, but know that you have to continue on to the next games in the series to get any sort of conclusion to the story (based on having just finished Overture, apparently the first in the series).One thing though - a lot of the combining inventory items and figuring puzzles out seemed almost impossibly difficult. I don't use walkthroughs very often at all, but I did for the majority of this game, and I have no idea how anyone could get through it without a walkthrough. Maybe I was impatient, but I think I definitely would have simply stopped playing the game if I wasn't 1) brought in by how scary it was and 2) the ability to use a walkthrough - otherwise I definitely would have put the game down and wouldn't have bothered. It's just not the type of game you *want* to spend tons of time on - you just want to play it. Perhaps I should play through Amnesia with a walkthrough...			"

												I came to this game because I was so impressed by SOMA.  I can say now that the Frictional team are masters at creating an atmosphere of genuine terror and authenticity (when viewed through the lens of 2007 technology), emphasizing story and thinking rather than egregious violence.However, by any standards, the gameplay is laughably bad at times.  ""Combat"" is either trivially stupid (tossing a can at a dog 5 times) or impossible (swinging a hammer at a spider).  The puzzles range from simple to impossibly counter-intuitive.  If you find yourself spending more than 5 minutes wondering what to do next, don't hesitate to look it up somewhere.  The story also leaves something to be desired.  There seem to be several subplots woven together, but I saw no real arc or connection between the story's beginning, middle, and end.  Maybe the dots are connected in the sequels?  Enjoy this game if you're interested in seeing the roots of Frictional's more modern work.  There is also something to be said for it's atmospherics, horrific story, and historical value, but not much.  Don't expect too much out of it as a game.  Like SOMA, some elements of the gameplay actually chip away at the value of the overall immersive experience.			"

												While not as polished as later Penumbra games and the Amnesia games it is still a extremely terrifying and mystifying game.The story follows Phillip a physics teacher at a British university but like most horror game characters is an idiot who heads to the middle of nowhere in the ice of Greenland looking for his presumed dead father,unprepared so ends up falling down a old hatch into a old abandoned mine/bunker.He continues further inside the mine to a more modern part of the mine ends up contacting a insane trapped miner 'Red'.He slowly finds out what is really happening in the mine.  There is a sort of crude combat system but I think it shows what a normal scared person would do,swinging pickaxes around trying to hit that thing in the dark,the story,music and dull graphics build a horrible atmosphere which is great and you never want to find out what's behind that door.     The Puzzles are interesting,original but sometimes just really annoying.You use any tools you can find from crowbars to boltcutters.    This game is still a great horror game and will run on pretty much anything!			"

												Penumbra: Overture, while originally a mere expansion of a tech demo by Frictional Games, does a decent job of standing as a full-fledged game. While not quite on par with Frictional's later and more famous effort, Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Penumbra fires off a trilogy that's intriguing in its own right, and just as atmospheric.Starting out in a cabin amidst a frozen waste, you're presented with little motivation beyond trying to uncover the fate of your presumably dead father. After stumbling your way through a howling blizzard, you clamber down a mysterious hatch and find yourself in an extensive cave system and facility that leaves a lot of questions to be answered. It's not long before you realize there may be someone, or something, down there with you that doesn't want you to find those answers.As Frictional tends to do with their games, the horror in Penumbra: Overture takes the form more of a looming dread than anything particularly scary. Your powerlessness is repeatedly reinforced, as even something as small as one of the wild dogs somehow roaming the underground can end your day. Using your wits, stealth, and remnants left by those inhabiting the caves before your arrival, most of Penumbra relies on solving puzzles to progress. As you get further in, more and more notes and instructions left behind push you even deeper, eventually toward something no one should have known was below.Visually, Penumbra definitely shows its age, but things look cave-y enough in the caves and lab-y enough in the occasional lab that you get the idea, and you're unlikely to get lost just because of how things look. Interaction with items feels a bit clumsy, as lifting things just makes them hover in front of you, but the ability to throw or use items and giving things weight appropriate to their apparent mass adds to the immersion of the game. Death, when it comes, is often swift and brutal, but the checkpoints are placed as to not make things too much of a hassle to retread. If you can, remember to manually save now and then, just to be safe.Other than the awkward interactions and a couple of puzzles being a bit difficult to figure out, there's nothing I really found fault in when playing Penumbra: Overture. I highly recommend picking up the follow-ups, Black Plague and Requiem, if you like the first.			"

												So I'm about 8 hours into the game and must say I'm really enjoying it. It is a jump back into time as the game came out in 07, and the method to opening doors is to right click the mouse button while your cursor is over the door and then move your mouse like you were actually opening the door. The story is interesting and I'm hoping it doesn't build up to a terrible ending.  The combat system is weak and repetitive with most enemies I've encountered so far.   Each time you attack one of the dog's it will run away (maybe go howl) then come back and attempt to attack you if you're on the ground. Tip usually I'll get on top of a box and when the dog jumps up swing at them with the hammer. Overall this is a great game and I recommend anyone who was a fan of the Original Resident Evil Series (Before 3/4) or Silent Hill to give this game a shot. I'm wishing I played it sooner.			"

												This review contains minor spoilers, mostly of the beginning of the game.Penumbra: Overture is a first person horror adventure game and the first part of the Penumbra series. You play as Philip, a physicist who teaches at university. After his mother's death he receives a letter from his supposedly dead father whom he barely remembers at all. The letter contains a key to a safety deposit box as well as the instruction to destroy everything that's in the deposit box. When Philip opens the box he finds several document and maps, some of which he cannot even decipher. The findings point to a location in Greenland though. So, instead of destroying everything Philip packs his things and leaves to follow the traces his father has left behind. After arriving at the location he manages to find an abandoned-looking mine.Penumbra: Overture plays in first person perspective. The player can manipulate objects by clicking on them and then dragging the mouse accordingly. Doors and drawers are used in the same fashion. This system was later refined and used again in Amnesia: The Dark Descent, so if you have played that one you have a pretty good idea how it works. Many of the puzzles are solved by manipulating objects in the enviroment. It is also possible to pick up various objects and pile them up to briefly block a door or throwing them as a distraction. Philip can also crouch and hide in the darkness - a skill that is very much required. While combat is possible I'd highly advice against it. There are only melee weapons available and those work in the same way as manipulating objects works. You have to actually swing them around using the mouse which is very awkward, difficult and therefore risky. The combat is the one thing I really dislike about the game. Luckily it is avoidable in most cases.While exploring the mines Philip has to mainly rely on stealth and wits. As already said combat is very dangerous and in most cases not worth the risk. Also, there are certain enemies which are so massive that you cannot possibly hurt them in any meaningful way. So for the majority of the time Philip has to lay low, hide if possible and run if necessary. While staying hidden works most of the time there are some parts of the game where you have to get away as fast as possible. This really helps with spicing things up and making the player feel unsafe. Many of the puzzles revolve around manipulating physics objects but there are also some which revolve around finding information and acting accordingly. So you have to example figure out how to assemble an explosive charge, find all necessary ingredients (or substitutes), assemble the device and use it to clear a cave-in, so you can move on. There are several other puzzles which can only be solved by exploring the environment and gathering the appropriate information. Those are very engaging and reward the player with a true sense of accomplishment after figuring out the solution.Penumbra: Overture features a really creepy atmosphere. You are all alone in the abandoned mines with no human being around but still it is obvious that people have been there until very recently. Whenever you apparently get really close to meeting another human being that chance is taken away from you, so for a majority of the time you can only rely on yourself and on the voice of a crazy sounding man who contacts you over the radio from time to time. While he sometimes sounds really nice he seems very unstable and probably not the person you want to rely on when it gets serious. Overall Penumbra: Overture does a very good job in emphasizing Philip being isolated in a hostile environment.Penumbra: Overture is the first half of a two-part game (Penumbra: Requiem is rather a spinoff which does not directly continue the main story). The story continues and reaches its conclusion with Penumbra: Black Plague. Because of that you will not be able to figure out the whole backstory after having played only Penumbra: Overture. There are find several hints to find, though. While I think that Penumbra: Black Plague is even better than Overture, Overture is still a really good game.If you like horror games and/or engaging puzzles this lesser known gem is something you should really try out.More reviews here "

Penumbra Overture is a pretty decent horror experience from the developers that eventually created Amnesia: The Dark Descent and SOMA. Follow in the footsteps of your father, who left a mysterious letter that points you to an abandoned mine made into a military bunker deep in icy Greenland. The gameplay is primary about sneaking around monsters, solving puzzles by combining items or using physics, breaking vent covers and breakable wood, and outrunning monsters.  There is very minor combat, but it is largely useless. It is a decent horror experience, but the dated graphics and semi-janky AI of the primary enemies won't scare most gamers nowadays. The game features a man following in the footsteps of his father who left him a mysterious letter from apparently before his birth, telling his son not to follow him. Having limited info about his fathers wherabouts and life, his curiosity got the best of him and he went off to find out what happened to him by going to a mine/military bunker in icy Greenland, pointed out to him in the letter.From there, you play as a fit, but not strong man, exploring a dark, and abandoned mine network solving relatively simple puzzles, sneaking around strange monsters, and out running even stranger monsters. The majority of your inventory use will be light sources (flares, flashlights, glowsticks) and puzzle items and keys, Penumbra hardly has combat, you can find a hammer, pickaxe and broom, but they will be used mostly to deal with easily breakable planks and barrels, and rarely if ever for combat. Attacking enemies never served me well, and I always found myself better off running away and somewhat exploiting the dog AI. Apparently you can kill spiders, but the ""attack"" mechanic is so clunky that its never worth it when it only takes two hits to be killed and the fast enemies are hard to hit. The dog like enemies has funky AI, which sometimes you can run away from if they ""Kind of detect you"" or sometimes detect you from really far away when they haven't before. The same dogs are also fooled by you jumping on a chest high box, and sometimes go away after you run in to a ""steam cage"" in the later portion of the game. (You can probably kill or subdue them here, but it has never worked out for me). You can use beef Jerky to distract them if you stay out of sight, but I found it better to learn their patterns and walk behind them. The gameplay is physics based and ""Mouse-motion control based"", so you have to swing your mouse to attack and drag your mouse to pull levers, twist valves, and open doors. Most players will either hate this for being needlessly cumbersome, or love it for the tension it brings. I found it good tension for opening doors and not knowing what to expect behind the door or when being chased, but was annoying otherwise. Thankfully, most ""inventory puzzles"" work like classic adventure games where you either combine items or place one over something in the environment.You'll eventually recieve communication from a character that has gone mad from living isolated in a small area of the mines for weeks and assists you in your journey. I grew a disdain for this character, as well as the lack of reaction from the PC for the way he treats him. The player character eventually has an opinion of him that I oppose, and I feel many other players will feel the same. To be as spoiler free as possible, the ending was unceremonius, abrupt, and a set up for the sequel. Average play time between me and friends is about 8-9hrs, which is quite fair for one half of a $10 package. You can probably finish it in half that time or less if you know solutions, but expect to play both titles for a full(er) story experience. Penumbra is hardly scary by today's standards, so I only suggest this for adventure game fans or players wanting to play the precursor to the Amnesia series. "

												Ever since I played Amnesia for the first time I've become a sucker for good horror games.  Don't confuse that with games like Resident Evil where you can just shoot everything and move forward I never felt that was scary.  If you can fight everything that shows up than its not really that scary.  Amnesia is the first game that I played where you are completely helpless.  Hide or die is the motto.Then I found Penumbra super cheap and got all 3 episodes for little over a dollar.  I been meaning to play it for ages but now I actually am.  Overture is the first episode in the series and while its not as scary as Amnesia yet its still pretty intense.  Yes you can fight but combat is so awkward and clunky you want to avoid more than fight.  Besides most of the monsters are unkillable so fighting them is just to stun so you can escape.  The story is confusing and disturbing.  This ended on quite the cliffhanger and I'm looking forward to continuing the series in Black Plague.			"

The puzzles were difficult and very well thought, they must have taken me forever.

												I've played this game before, at least I think I have. I don't know if there's a glitch or it's me but I cannot get the  contol panel in the Refinery to work. I get no hand icon.Would I recommend it, yep if I can figure out what I'm going wrong.			"

												The game is very scary. Those who like Silent Hill type horror games, will like Penumbra also. The game in its entirety is fairy simple, the puzzles are simple, but general environment and athmosphere is scary and spooky indeed.			"

												I don't leave many reviews, usually because I'm too busy playing a game.Like another reviewer mentioned, this game is neither good nor bad.It's interesting.It's not nearly as creepy as many other games (FEAR series, the first Bioshock, etc.)It's worth the price when less than $10.However - considering you will eventually need to kill something (a rabid dog or one of those damn spiders)the combat functionality is just plain bad. It's worse than most games ported from a controller to a keyboard,and incredibly frustrating. This really needs to be fixed.I'll recommend it, but be prepared to die multiple times in a row because you can't get the damn""click - drag right - flick left"" melee to work...grrrrr.			"

												Yet another Horror Puzzle game at its finest. Grotesque creatures stalk your every move while you figure out which way you need to go, as well as solve any puzzles that are between you and your way out.Frictional games don't disappoint in these games as they will always keep you on your toes, like a midget in a urinal. The only downside that I have seen is the crude combat that exists. Throwing certain objects, using a hammer to strike them, or just simply sitting on top of a crate where they can't hit you but you can hit them kind of takes away the helpless feeling that Amnesia has. However, the sequel to Overture pretty much elminiated this making Black Plague an improvement.Overture is Part 1 of the Penumbra trilogy, and I also recommend playing the others as well (Black Plague and Requiem).9/10			"

												Well Penumbra Overture Iam so happy to add this game to my horror collection it is among the most unique and satisfying horror game of all time the atmosphere is nothing short of brilliant and will have you squirming in your chair the whole play through. The game play is very unique and similair to Amnesia which by the way is one of my favorite horror games as well but penumbra takes a different approach when it comes to horror and builds the terror as you play with each moment and every solved puzzle bringing you further into the madness that is penumbra. 10 out of 10 a must have for horror fans.

												Deep in the uncharted planes of northern Greenland lays an abandoned mine. You start out the game as Phillip, a physicist who got a mysterious letter from his father who has been dead for 30 years. In the letter are coordinates to an abandoned mine, so you decided to go check out what your father has been trying to hide since his death. Upon arrival, you find yourself alone, scared, and  defenceless . As you explore the mine, you decend deeper and deeper into the bowels of the Earth. Along the way, you slowly start losing grip on what is and isn't reality. I would give  Penumbra Overture  an 8/10. This game has a really great atmosphere and setting. The main down side to this game is that it can be a bit buggy from time to time, but 90% of the time it runs perfectly.			"

												Having played the first hour of this game I suddenly found myself trying to come up with reasons never to come back to to it again. I set it aside and about a week later I realized that the reasons I came up with were mere a cover to the underlying reality: I was too afraid to play it. Ashamed of my coward self I launched the game once again and let my manly self be engulfed by the darkness.The greatest compliment you can pay to a horror game is refusing to play it because you are too â¥â¥â¥â¥ing scared to do it.

												Penumbra is a horror/adventure series by Frictional Games, the developers of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. While not nearly as good as that horror masterpiece, there is still a lot to enjoy in Penumbra. In fact, it's very easy to see how Amnesia eventually came to be what it is - its elements are on full display here, albeit in early forms. While the games do have some scary bits, overall the fright-factor is not quite where it could be. This is mainly due to the somewhat dated graphics and easily thwarted enemies (which, unlike in Amnesia, can usually be killed). The puzzles are generally pretty decent, with only a few solutions being particularly obtuse. So, while not perfect, the series is still worth a look for horror/adventure game fans, especially those who enjoyed Amnesia and are interested in seeing the roots of that game and supporting its developers.Penumbra: Overture is the 1st game in the series. It's decent, but has some rough edges and doesn't quite come together fully.			"

												The game largely forces you to do combat with dogs and spiders, a generally unscary but annoying experience given the horrible combat controls. Avoiding them was suggested, but enemies are not anywhere near scary enough to warrant hiding. Amnesia's Grunts and Brutes always warrented hiding, a big difference.Small amounts of steam coming from pipes should never be used as an environmental killer. It feels wimpy to die to it.The puzzles are too short and easy. Honestly the game feels like a chore.Going to give Black Plague a shot after this. Currently considering Overture as Frictional's warmup attempt at a comercial horror game.Amnesia was stellar though.			"

												Solid horror experience. I definitely suggest this to anyone new to the horror corner of gaming, while it certainly has its share of scary moments, they aren't heart attack inducing like Outlast or Amnesia. It has quite a few gameplay faults, that when known, will greatly lessen the scare factor, so try to avoid let's plays before you've actually beaten the game. Another thing worth note is that this game DOES NOT hold your hand, at all. There are quite a few headache-inducing puzzles that will ruin your sanity until you've figured them out.Definitely give this one a try, especially at such a cheap price.			"

												I often play horror games with my friends, not because I'm afraid to play alone but because it's more fun to share  that creepy atmosphere at home while playing the game or just watch my friend freak out when a jumpscare pops up.So after an hour of playing the game with my friends , I turned it off. We got bored of it and went to watch a movie instead. After about 3 weeks later I decided to try this game alone, give it another go. I started from the begining and this time I got hooked. The atmosphere that this game gives is really good. You start fearing that some creature is waiting for you behind every door and after entering a room you barricade the entrance just because you feel safer. In some games it's more beneficial to just reload a save because you wasted some items needlesly or just lost some health points but in this game I felt happy because I was stopped being chased by monster. I didn't care that I lost half of my health and wasted items needlesly, I was just glad I was safe at that point. The puzzles of the game are alright but some of them make no sense. I had to look at a walkthrough for one of the puzzles which is a bad thing because it just destroyed the immersion I had. About the puzzle I was stuck on >  Ther's a locked door with a key that's inside from the other side. What I had to do is push the key out and manage to get it back somehome. The door is clearly touching the floor so there's no way of getting the key from under it. Turns out you have to put a newspaper under the door, push the key out, the key falls on the newspaper, you pull the newspaper and collect the key. But how could the key fit if there wasn't a gap between the door and the floor???  If you're looking for a horror game to play, then you should give this game a try.			"

												Penumbra: Overture is one of the best adventure/survival horror games I've ever played. The only real flaw with the game is that the weapons are pointless and the game would be better without them, and this mechanic was rightfully removed in Black Plague and Requiem. The story is Overture's greatest strength; you are thrown into a world of mystery, and the game does everything it can do build up atmosphere. Overture focuses on fear of the unknown, which works very well for it since most of the questions brought up would be answered in the later games. Overture is my favorite of the Penumbra series and is my second favorite survival horror games of all time (only to Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs.) I whole-heartedly recommend it, as well as the other great Penumbra games.			"

												The original Puzzle Horror game from Frictional games, Penumbra: Overture is the start of a trilogy to remember.  I played Amnesia: The Dark Descent first (having learned of it through youtube hype back when it was first released), and then when I found myself craving more and searching on Frictional's website, I came across this gem.  There is a free demo of this game available from said website, and I recommend playing that if you want a taste of the game before you buy.  It is very much like Amnesia TDD, although in a slightly brighter yet just as grim underground mine.  The atmosphere is eerie, and the story is captivating and can really make you emotional at points (it did for me, anyway).  I definitely recommend this to those who want horror games that play like Amnesia: TDD.  Or, for those who are just discovering Frictional's work, Penumbra:Overture is a wonderful place to start.

												TL;DR - Starts strong, good atmosphere but quickly becomes repetitive. Some great puzzles, but most are frustrating, and don't seem to make much sense. Worth a play if you're buying the whole collection. Not worth a buy on its own.This is a hard game to review because it's one of those in between games. I don't want to thumbs it up, but I don't want to thumbs it down. The first couple of hours of the game were pretty good, the build up and atmosphere was done really well. But when it got into it I wasn't scared throughout the entire game which is kinda disappointing. I think it's due to bad AI; once I realised with the dogs you can just stand on top of a box and beat them to death they no longer became any sort of threat. The game very quickly became boring and repetitive as each section of the game is pretty much the same. Big area leading to smaller areas, guarded by dogs with some sort of puzzle to solve to continue. That was pretty much every area in the game. The puzzles in the game are hit and miss. There was a puzzle fairly early on that involved Morse code and the way the game got you to solve it was excellent, I felt like a complete genius after solving that. It wasn't a frustrating puzzle, took a little while but solve it. But then most of the other puzzles were absoluteâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Later on in the game you grab 6 chemicals which you are supposed to mix in some sort of order to create something (I'm trying not to spoil anything best I can). Right, and literally nowhere is there any clue in what order to mix them. I'd grabbed all the notes and everything, read carefully, and couldn't work out anything. So, I passed the puzzle by trial and error. Mix this with this, nope. This with that, nope. 5 mins later... Yay I solved it!? Also, there is this really annoying worm creature that you occasionally run into where you have to run away and escape from right. Well, it's one of those â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ chases where it's literally impossible to solve first try. You have to die, get a little further by working out what to do, die again. Progress more than you did but die again. Until eventually you know exactly what to do to get away from the creature.The way I see it, if you're going to buy the whole package of the games, then it is worth a play. I wouldn't recommend buying this to be honest, or at least buy it in the sales.			"

												In the late 90's I published a Call of Cthulhu RPG scenario on Cthonian that resides near a coal mine somewhere in Eastern Europe, so this game has been pretty much a deja vu for me. Unfortunately, the game itself does not stand the test of time. Graphics is crude. Plot is decent, but nothing more. It is full of Lovecraftian cliches. The characters (character) you meet  being affected, implausible. The worst part of the game, however, is physics and controls. Interactions with environment tend to be clumsy, using equipment is very unhandy. How big is the problem? Well, I tend to avoid all creatures not because I was afraid of them (as it should be in horror games), but because I struggle to omit any fight possible. To simply hit an opponent with a pickaxe was a challenge requiring very high skills with mouse and keyboard. At the same time the enemies are plain stupid (attacking until dead in a repetitive manner) and happen to die in weird positions - dogs drop dead 2 ft above ground, or partly in the wall or in the ground. Again, it's a glitch, not a horror element.All in all, not recommended (says a Lovecraft fan). I had to force myself to finish the game.			"

												I recommend this because the next game in the series is very good.Overture really only seems to set the scene and has few good scares or puzzles (some are more annoying and solved through trail and error)..All said and done it was a decent game with a dark vibe and a strong story which gets better in the next game.

												The game ends in a cliffhanger. It is very clear that this is episode one, as it is stated both in the menu and by the main character in the end. Still, it's a very good game and I'd say it almost works as a 7-hour length demo of the Penumbra: Black Plague.The story of a man seeking for his father in some vast and deserted area with mutants has been seen often before, but I think that Penumbra's story isn't concentrated on the things you hear from the main character, but instead hidden inside the articles and letters you find throughout the game.I don't have a lot of time to analyze the awesome athmosphere or the great ending this game has, but I can say that this is a very considerable purchase. I haven't played Amnesia (yet), and this is a very good introduction to the Frictional Games' view of physics and story.I recommend this title.			"

												This is the first of a trilogy made by the makers of Amnesia, so if you've played Amnesia then you will find pretty much a lot of similarities from that franchise in these games in a more modern day scenario (amnesia was set in the middle ages, this is modern, so instead of a lantern with oil, you have a flashlight with batteries, although you also have a glowstick with unlimited power, but obviously not as powerful as the flashlight) with a somewhat interesting (and honestly confusing) storyline. If you're looking for a single player game that is cheap and will have you thinking to solve puzzles and that you'll play around 10 hours on (in each game) I recommend the Penumbra trilogy!			"

Penumbra will have you on the edge of your seat the whole way through (Unless you get stuck on a puzzle area) other then that the game is very fun and for the price of ten dollars its a great deal and it even comes with the sequel. Penumbra: Black Plague which is also very fun!			"

												I finished this game some time ago I think late 2013. Yes it took me 6 years to finally play this and when I did I was so glad I played it, this is the precursor to Amnesia: The Dark Descent and it's really nice to go back and see the evolution of Frictional's horror games and how they did so well with Amneisa. Anyways this game is really good while it is not amazing in terms of horror it really stands on it's own. There are no incredible grotesque monsters to hide from and the creatures you do encounter can be dispatched with weapons found, the puzzles are incredibly simple and the atmosphere does well to put you on edge.Overall I think this game is deserving of the attention of all horror fans and I highly recommend you play the others in the series too.

												I have not played this game, because it is scary, and scary things scare me, but I feel confident in writing a recommendation because I've checked out a couple screenshots and listened to Tchaikovsky's ""1812 Overture"" a couple times (this game has ""overture"" in its name).Basically this is a game about, you know, dark things in a place, and you do stuff, and I think monsters attack you? But it's also psychological horror, like, when you have just pooped and then you realize you might be out of toilet paper and it's the feeling you get before you turn to check if you do or do not have toilet paper. That kind of horror. Or the kind of horror that you get when you realize that you're going to be a parent. Or cancer.Also this game has physics in it, which is important because physics is science and science is the future and children are the future. This is a good game for children. To teach them physics.I give this game an 8 out of 10 Draculas (vampires are also scary).			"

												Penumbra Overture is an excellent survival horror game with a unique physics-based system that isn't very common in the survival horror genre. Sometimes frustrating because of the occasionally confusing puzzles, but overall frightening because of the tension that stems from a combination of dark atmosphere and being pursued by creepy enemies (mostly animals in this game). Not quite as good as its sequel, Penumbra Black Plague, but still a great game on its own (and much better than the third game in the series, Penumbra Requiem).

												the overture is the first game in penumbra series and its also first game by frictional games and you can see its their first gamestory-you go into the mine where you trying to find something that leads to youre characters father because he probably did some research and something screwed up,and then he dissapeard (i guess)along the way you encounter youre only enemy in this game........Dogs.......zombie dogs.yeah and then there is a giant worm but he wont chase you throghout a whole game so whats the pointbut lets talk about zombie dogs.who the hell thought they will be good enemies?!if you kill them they respawn but even with that theyre not good enemies.youre always quicker so you can lose them and if you will see dead end ahead of you,well dont worry just throw stuff at them they will stop.God even spiders youll meet are more terrifying.thats not the games only flaw.youll might love the envoirment of the mine but me...wellim sorry but it was quite boring envoirment,it felt all the time same for mewith that what i said you might think i hate the game  but actualy i think its quite decent.puzzles are decent and made me think for a while and even though i said that enemies sucks,atmosphere is really great and it actually feels like a horrorthe story isnt the best but also not the worstto sum up the game is decent but ill rather reccommend playing second one because i think that second one is betterbut if you want to know what happened in the begining go ahead and play it.its quite short so even if wouldnt like it you can end it in less then 3 hours not bad start for frictional games6,5/10			"

												The atmosphere in Penumbra: Overture is great. It's dark, creepy, lonely, and cold. The physics engine is okay, with some flaws here and there, but nothing worth seriously complaining about. The moving of objects and melee actions can take getting used to, but once you're comfortable with the physics engine, it works okay, although far from perfectly. The game flows through the story smoothly without any frustration or senseless puzzles/problems to be solved. Everything is logical and upfront, requiring a realistic approach and a reasonable amount of thinking to proceed. The save system is unfriendly. It seems to save your progress when you update your personal notes, or when you interact with a certain object within the game world, which the player has little control over when this occurs. This means that you will often have to do certain portions of the game over and over until you get it right. The voice acting is superb. The accent and tone are outstanding and adds to the storyline greatly. All of the texts you will encounter in the game are well written, interesting, and adds plenty to the plot. The controls can be awkward at times in order to accomplish some actions the game requires. Penumbra: Overture is not a scary horror game. Most of its interesting emotional influences on the player comes from the theme of being almost completely solitary in an unknown place that is far from civilization and darkness. There are some instances in the game that requires the rapid change of items in conjunction to platforming and running, which I had to do many times to get it right. There is also a surprising amount of platforming as a whole for a primarily adventure game. Some parts of Penumbra: Overture are really cool, there is no denying that, but it does have a feel of an unpolished low budget title. With that said, this is probably one of the best adventure games I have ever played. It is logical and tense at all the right moments. I am not entirely sure for how long the main character is inside the mine, but the glow stick lasts for the entire duration of the game. You are not forced nor expected to use the flashlight nor the flares, which have finite longevity. I found melee fighting to be clunky and awkward, but this did not detract from the overall gaming experience. The ending is very creepy and will keep you glued to the plot, even though there is much left without explanations. The only major downside is the game's length. It is somewhat short and leaves you with a feeling of unfinished business with a cliffhanger.Penumbra: Overture is good.			"

												This game will make you crap your pants. It was made by Frictional Games which is the same company that later went on to make Amnesia. There's small, hard-to-hit spiders in the game and they will mess you UP. There's also dog/wolf things scattered throughout the whole game but once you figure out how to kill them, they'll be a breeze to run through. Although the game is scary, it's very well-made and has an environment-interaction that I don't think I've ever seen before			"

												Builds a great sense of horror through simple design choices; no weapons, complete isolation, and immersive atmosphere. A survival horror game that requires a lot of forethought and skill to actually survive. Very unique experience with great puzzles and a story that continues straight into the sequel, Black Plague. If you're looking for something to scare your pants off for a few evenings then this and it's sequels are worth getting.			"

												Short Review Incoming:PENUMBRA OVERTURE the first installment of the Penumbra series is a good horror game. The atmosphere is amazing and really eerie. This and the sound-design is what makes this game for me. It's creepy without any kind of disturbing imagery or jumpscares. On the other hand: The gameplay is rottenâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ The puzzles are not really well thought through and most of the time you have no clue what to do. And the combat... OH boy the combat. It's dreadful. Hit detection seems like it's non exsistent in this game. It isn't really fun to play.I would say skip Overture, read a plot summary and start with black plague which is a much better game!			"

												Play Amnesia instead.This game plays exactly like what it is: Frictional Games' first shot at a full video game. The horror, atmosphere, and story elements are as good as always, but there are additions to the game that just make it worse.1) The AI is terrible.2) Being able to attack/defeat the monsters takes away from the horror.Their later games keep all of the good parts of this game and remove all of the bad.

												This is the first of the Penumbra Series.I was an avid fan of Amnesia: the Dark Descent, and wanted to try another Frictional Games piece. This game is somewhat disappointing. Without giving away too much of the story:- There is only one or two types of enemies during the entirety of the game, making their patterns highly predictable and once you find a way to exploit their terrible AI, they fail to present any challenges. -  The story is written as if an edgy teen indie team created it. The story must be intentionally vague, as (SPOILERS) the ending literally finishes with ""to be continued."" As a player, you never actually know what's going on. Sure, you know where you are and that you want to escape and how you got to where you are: the basics. The more you play, however, the more unanswered questions you end up with.- I want to give this piece the benefit of the doubt and consider the entire series in my review; perhaps the second and third games answer all of these questions and creates a fantastically crafted story. Unfortunately, the first game alone does not produce that faith in me.Although the game is an older ""classic,"" the story and mechanics are ridiculously simple, repetitive, and ultimately boring. Perhaps after the other games, I will feel better about the series, but this game is not worth playing alone.--EDIT--The remainder of this review is after I have completed the second game - Black PlagueI will reserve my criticism for that specific review, but because the sequel answers many questions and is a good game, Overture is a necessary evil for the means of continuity in the series.Long story short, Black Plague is far better than this game, but you should play this too for the best effect.

												Okay, so the best thing about this paranormal/survival horror game is the one thing many games out there don't have and which is my biggest peeve: ENVIRONMENTALLY INTERACTIVE. Yes, Finally, a game designer had a brain. I hate when there are things in the room and they are just made to look pretty and not be messed with, like part of the building's structure. If you see a book, you can pick it up. If you see a mattress, you can toss it, use it for a puzzle, launch it over a cliff. Glass can be broken. Hell, throw a barrel at your enemy and watch him stumble. How control how you pick it up and where you want it to go, Go play jenga with barrels and bags of garbage. XDAs for that, the rest of the game is very enjoyable in a very dark and strange way. The lighting, the atmosphere, the game dynamics. Very nice. Never had an issue with the game, including gameplay, puzzles, exploring. The game's sequel Black Plague is also just as enjoying, but not so much as the expansion Requiem.I highly recommend this game. NOTE: This is my opinions and thoughts of the game and not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research.			"

												The game fell short at the end (figuratively and litterally; you can beat the game in 8 hours). You won't miss much if you just read a summary of the story on the internet. The game really sets a good scary atmosphere though, but it never gets as scary as I hoped it would be. The dogs and the spiders justâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥me off more than they scare me, especially when I realised you could kill them.

Even though when the game came out there were already better options, the controls are bad the graphics are ok, the sound is ok, the overall story is fine but very limited. They could've gone deeper into the game lore. I haven't played the next game yet but hopefully that brings about a much more detailed story to keep me involved.			"

												I know this now comes as a pack and can't be bought seperately so to not play it would be wasteful, but in my honest opinion Black Plague is far better and this doesn't have much worth in playing except for experiencing the lead up to how the second game starts.This is because after only maybe an hour in everything becomes quite repetitive while nothing much happens story-wise either except for three short excursions that were fairly interesting but buried within the repetition. *edit* [Hardly a spoiler/Not a story spoiler]:After the encounter with the first monster, they become annoyances that are tiring to deal with. If you're looking for the adrenaline rush of scary encounters, you'll get maybe two out of this. Also, for the most part, what happens in the story in this game is explained in the second game. What you do get is more insight on a particular character and of course more notes to read. The ending felt quite underwhelming.What I will say that I enjoyed more in this game is that the notes you find are much more helpful (and usually necesssary) to your progression compared to Black Plague which means there's less of a feeling of ""I have these useless notes that I could read but I'm not that interested in"". However, the puzzles are also sometimes just a matter of wandering around which detracts from them.To conclude I wouldn't say you should definitely avoid this game, but that it provides a lot less than Black Plague does in almost every aspect. I feel that skipping this game improves the quality:hour ratio and you don't miss a lot by doing so. If you do decide to skip it and then feel interested in coming back to it, by all means. There are a few sections that are worth playing.			"

												Penumbra series are quite good games in general.  THey are a bit old but the story and adventure part of it is done quite well and is engrossing to a degree.The puzzles and quest are quite well done though a little illogical at times and can be monotonous, but overall they get you thinking.  The horror side is mehhhhh!  The game is predominantly in the dark and the creatures are from a B grade horror from the 50's but it does set the mood at times, especially with the audio effects etc.The graphics are very ordinary compared to modern capabilities but for the time they were okay.  The AI of the dogs etc is appalling and quite comical but again its primarily due to the era of the game.The part that kills al these penumbra games is the controls.  Its beyond bad.  They tried to be clever and realistic by making the use grab item and swing in an arc to open boxes and doors, or try to line up items using the mouse but overall kill the game.  You cant actually line any thing up so when trying to smash one of these crazy wandering brain dead dogs you end up doing the cha cha and relying on pot luck. Luckily as stated the AI is near non existant so simply get on a box etc and just swing and mash buttons and eventually the job will get done.Its a pity really because I was getting into the game itself but it just gets frustrating and unplayable.It would be great if they ever revamped the series as it has the making of a good game, but unfortunately I think this game is long forgotten.If u can pick it up cheap and have the patience of a saint when coming to control etc then I'd say you could do a lot worse.If its a action adventure your looking for then give this a wide birth!Steam should put a star system as I'd give this game 2 to 2 and half stars out of 5, but can not recommend for most people.

After about 30 minutes of trying to open that fecking hatch in the snow I gave up out of frustration as the rock kept dropping willy nilly and I was not able to control its height or position with any accuracy. Why do developers have to mess with tried and true control methods i.e. grab something and securly carry it until needed. Oh and make use of the laws of physics and allow you to throw or drop an item with at least a little accuracy. Just....frustrating.			"

												Penumbra Overrated. The atmosphere is great, the puzzles are ok and the enemies, plot, and stealth elements fall flat. This is not a spooky game. The atmosphere builds it up to be, but disappointing enemies and trial and error game play takes all that away. Your enemies are guard dogs & spiders, and very rarely a big worm thing, that's it. Some supernatural or especially fierce enemies could have added a lot of tension, but nope, just doggies. If you were dropped in the middle of the game with no explanation you would probably guess you were playing a poor wolfenstein clone.Certain parts of the game are only possible to complete by reading a walkthrough ahead of time or by dying over and over until you determine the correct sequence of events (especially the rockworm at the end). This repeated trial and error type game play replaces any feelings of suspense with ones of frustration.The plot starts off strong and mysterious, falls a bit flat in the middle and leaves with a confusing ending. This game had potential but at the end I was glad I had finished it just so that i can say i beat it and don't have to touch it again.			"

												I like this game's approach; Physics based puzzles, emphasis on atmosphere and story instead of violence. But once you know the type of enemies (hounds and spiders) you will encounter, the game is starting to lose its spookiness. When I discovered the clunkiness and the poor AI of the hounds I lost all interest, major game breaking element for me. You can stand on top of a barrel or crate and the hounds are unable to get you. Skip this title and try other entries in the series.			"

												Meh.  Thumbs up, but not that far up.  Decent semi tense horror type game from the Amnesia folks.  If you've already played Amnesia, you may want to just pass on this.  If you're a huge horror game fan it might be worth your while.			"

												OH HAI WE HAVE A â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ AND COMPLETELY UNPREDICTABLE 2007 UI, LET'S MAKE ALL OF OUR PUZZLES EXTREMELY COMPLICATED!!!!!!!!NONE of the puzzles make any sense. Every single different one I have had to use a walktrhough BECAUSE the interactions with items are NOT PREDICTABLE AT ALL. Sometimes you can pick up shovels, but in the next level you cannot. Why? I don't know, probably because the makers of this game wanted to make all the puzzles complex, but had to save space. I do not recommend this game for anyone who does not enjoy having to use walkthroughs and tear out their hair trying to figure out â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ levels. I've been stuck on a level for THREE WEEKS. This is absolutely ridiculous. Don't make your puzzles so complex and elaborate IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FORM OF STABILITY IN THE INTERACTIONS WITH YOUR ITEMS, JESUS CHRIST.			"

												Terrible game, your stuck in a mineshaft solving physic based puzzles. Only thing is the puzzles make no sense so you have to backtrack trying to figure out what you need or have to do. For example, there is a puzzle where you need to hang a broken ladder on this hanger where the lights are suppose to be. so i ignore the fact that a ladder goes on a hook the lights. But here is the thing the broken ladder is in two seperate pieces. and i got one of the pieces up already, so the logical thing for me to do is to try and piece together the other part of the ladder to reach the ground where im at. After spending about 20-30 min flinging this extra piece of metal around, trying every angle to get it to connect like a tetris piece, i give up and search online for help. Come to find out, I only need one piece of the ladder and i have to stack â¥â¥â¥â¥ing boxes to reach it.  Well holy crap, of course!! what was i thinking!? why would anyone try and put together a ladder when they could stack â¥â¥â¥â¥ing boxes.   Another time i have a rock roll and chase me, I somehow reach the end, only for the game to autosave upon my death at the end of the tunnle. So everytime i load, i die. So i load a previous save, i get past the boulder and dodge it, this time it autosaves when spider hatches  and i have to dig my way out. Again i die over and over, so i reload from previous save again. Come to find out, i have to destroy wood, that make boulder fall into a hole, run past spiders, and block parts of cave with rocks you move, showing off physic puzzle. At a certain point it become dumb, because the puzzles are not logically thought out. And you have to complete a checklist of a certain way to get past an encounter, which is fine....but don't make the next scenario impossible if i somehow get past it by not following your checklist, making me reload after multiple attempts of me thinking i did it the right way, only to find out it is impossible to continue beacuse i didn't do it their way.

												This is one of those cases where Steam needs a ""Maybe"" button, but since binary is the only option (and my experience of the game is bent slightly towards the negative) i'll have to go with ""No"" and then proceed to explain why.You play as some dude trapped in a mine underneath the freezing cold of Greenland. The gameplay is pretty straightforward: You arrive to an ""area"" of the mine, which consists of a few rooms connected by halls patrolled by monsters. You can see the map of the area in numerous locations in the halls (some are almost next to each other... was it so hard to have the protagonist carry the map around and view it with a simple button?). You visit the rooms, find clues, closed doors, broken machines, etc. and must then proceed to solve these puzzles in order to progress to the next area. You cannot visit previous areas nor move on until you completely clear the current one.You get some makeshift weapons, though you're not supposed to use them and instead sneak by the enemies by crouching and moving carefully in the darkness (BOOORING! it was slightly exciting the first time but seriously, there's some parts which you must navigate back and forth, and having to sneak carefully EVERY SINGLE TIME? c'mon), though i ended up developing a strategy to kill all the monsters so i could then move freely aboutWhat i disliked the most was the story to game length ratio. The whole plot is summarised in two sentences at the beginning of the next game, and it really feels overstretched at some points (a lot of times i was like ""ugh, can something happen please? i'm just here solving all these puzzles and nothing happens story-wise"")Audio, video and ambience are OK, but definitely not scary (and i always played with headphones and at night with all lights off). I really hope they didn't intend the locations to be frightening or disturbing, because if they did they fell very short of it.Finally the puzzles can be divided in two categories: traditional and physics-based. Traditional puzzles are like ""this machine is broken, find the parts, place them in the correct spots and start the machine with a specific sequence of steps ambiguously described in this text"" and they always feel too easy. Physics-based puzzles are like ""an electric fence is blocking the way"" and you must move things around (boxes, planks) to get through. Now i don't have anything against pysics-based puzzles, but most of the time there's no indication whatsoever that you're facing one of these, so you can spend some time wandering around an entire area until you realise that in the room in the complete opposite side of the mine has some stuff that MIGHT be the physics puzzle that you need to move on.tl;dr more annoying than innovative, and definitely not scary at all.

												I wouldn't necessarily classify this as a horror game after a couple hours with it. The game has its moments of horror, but they only slightly stretch passed the initial reactions to it. The beginning does a good job of keeping you in the dark in terms of story and atmosphere. There's a sense of confusion and loss that doesn't leave; however, this eventually turns to a sense of confusion based upon the lackluster combat and wonderment of why you should be scared. The enemies aren't difficult to run from, I found myself just running through areas avoiding enemies because of the horrid combat. Along with the weak combat, you'll get lost fairly easily as there's little to no direction regarding your goals.The game is short, so if you're looking for some cheap thrills, then I'd recommend it, but if you're looking for an engaging story and continuous horror, look elsewhere. 5/10			"

												First off, I do recommend the next episode, and if you are buying that, this episode will likely come in a bundle with that. But regardless I found this episode to be kind of lackluster.The game controls like a typical first person game, except the bulk of the gameplay is puzzle solving similar to that found in classic point and click adventure games. These puzzles are nothing special but managed not to bore me too much. There is however a fair amount of finding a locked door then finding a key, literal or figurative, in some random place. Fortunately the areas are small enough that they are not usually hard to find. Where the episode fell flat for me was the supposed horror elements. In between the rooms with all the puzzles in them there are some kind of mutant dogs or wolves roaming the hallways. These to me were not scary and were just kind of annoying. The strategy for getting past them is generally just walking slowly and hiding slightly out of sight when one is in the way until it moves away. There are some other creatures you come across which you have to run away from and these sections are very trial and error. At least one of the creatures would be scary but when you've played the same part repeatedly because of the trial and error nature of the gameplay, it loses any scariness it once had.There isn't a whole lot to the story. You're trying to enter an underground facility to find out what happened to your father who mysteriously dissappeared. There are various obstacles in your way and some crazy guy talks to you over a radio to guide you along. If you were to start with the second episode, you'd find yourself in the middle of the facility without knowing how you got there but there isn't really that much necessary background information needed to enjoy the second episode.

Several times the game would save right in a bad spot where it would load, and u would be dead 5 seconds later.Maybe an older computer will have more luck, but not recommended by me.			"

												When it was released, Penumbra had a relatively sophisticated physics engine. Too much of the game relies on the player marveling at the ability ot move objects around. And when that wears off, which it does very quickly, you're left with simplistic, unsatisfying puzzles.High points of the game are the writing, which you observe in the form of scattered notes, and voice-over work, which is limited. Overall, the game feels like a software physics project with game elements forced upon it.			"

The areas are bleak and bland. The music and sound effects however are great. The overall game feels empty and just cohesioned with long tunnels and hallways that merit littlle interest. I will give credit to the concept; which is marginally if not minimally presented in a generic package. The best way to describe this title is...............DRYY!!			"

												Penumbra Overture is a strange one. It is classed survival/horror, but I felt neither of those. It felt more like a trial-by-death rage game. Try to do anything, you die, until you die enough times to feel out what specific actions you need to take to not die so quickly. Granted, I played on the hardest difficulty so it probably would have been quite a bit more manageable on lower difficulties, but the lack of direction killed it for me. Not on a macro story level, but on a micro encounter level. For example, hopefully without spoilers, one level immediately drops you into an encounter where the character states, in subtitles, that they need to seal ""that door"" whilst looking at a door that obviously can't be the target of the statement. You are then in a large room with somewhat of a gauntlet arrayed before you, and if you take more than half a second to look around, even to get your bearings for the first time, you are dead. It took me at least a couple dozen attempts to coincidentally use that half second in the right spot facing the right direction to realize there was a button. Then I died again. And that was just the first leg of the gauntlet. There were at least two of these situations, together probably representing half of the time I put into this short game. Half the time the game decides to ignore its own mechanics, such as an enemy completely ignoring a distraction that should have worked, and had worked on previous occassions, for no discernable reason. There were also several cases where I would be hiding behind cover, such as a box or around a corner, waiting for the chance to sneak by, and the dog I was hiding from would suddenly start growling and teleport right next to me to rip my throat out. This game made me feel as though there were some hidden timer, and I weren't allowed to go more than a half-minute without dying, usually for no fault of my own.The controls aren't very intuitive when it comes to the use of tools. I often found myself swinging short or my goal, or in a different manner than I wanted, which in itself got me killed quite often. There wasn't much story, nor was I particularly captivated, but this is only the first chapter in a trilogy. I did like the character Red very much however, in both his voice acting and portrayal. I will also admit that even with all these things, once the credits rolled I was surprised to find how small the crew was, and for the team size I think the game was pretty good.Context aside though, as the game itself stands I don't find myself compelled to recommend it.

												It's the first commercial release from Frictional Games, the guys who made Amnesia: TDD. There are a few high points in the game, like the good voice acting of the character named ""Red"" and also unsurprisingly the atmosphere is great. But on the other end of the scale the ""combat system"" is completely broken and the game has very loose ties to the personal story of the main character, because the whole game focuses on this ""Red"" guy who in the end is very unimportant.The sequel Penumbra: Black Plague is far superior, and at points is even better than Amnesia in my opinion. I know this is supposed to be a recommendation, but I quess I can also recommend people to stay away from games, so this one right here is definitely one you should skip.			"

												Ths game is kinda weak. I got myself worked up for the first 30 minutes of the game, not realising there wasn't any thing to chase me yet, and then when they got to their first ""scare"" it was just a spider the size of my hand just crawling past me. Then, when a REAL threat came around, it growled which startled me (this was when I was still excited about getting the game), but I crawled around a corner and saw it was a bloody ( yet still unintimidating) dog the size of my spaniel, that I could run past without it noticing. Then later I decided to whack it with a hammer that I got very early in the game and it FELL OVER AND SURE AS   HELL TOOK ITS TIME TO GET BACK UP. Later I got on a crate where the dog couldn't get me but wanted to, so I kept hitting it with the hammer, and it DIED. That left me free of the dog until I went to another area, skipping and singing, ""ding dong, the witch is dead."" I just wish they made a better, scarier, maybe IMMORTAL, at least, monster. Plus, the riddles are SO FREAKING HARD. Had to watch PewDiePie play it to know wtf I was doing. But don't listen to me completely, I haven't beaten it yet, and I heard it gets more intense. CONCLUSION: Not a scary game (to me) but don't be COMPLETELY persuaded. Also, definately play this if you wanna play this game's sequal, Penumbra: Black Plague, which IS quite scary, but you won't understand a single thing in it if you don't play this; Overture. If you absolutely DO NOT GIVE A â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the story, go ahead and play Black Plague, but you'll be left with a crap ending that you won't get or like if you don't play Overture.Ok, I've played the rest now and it got a LITTLE more scary.Just a couple parts with a huge worm. Long story.So, all in all, I'd just get Black Plague and just enjoy the scares.6.5/10 wud play baseball practice with some spiders agin			"

												This is one of those survival horror games.  I guess people are buying this stuff.  It's not for me, though.  I played it for about ten minutes, then something spooky happened, I almost wet my pants, turned the game off, and hid under my bed quietly sobbing.  When I worked up the courage to turn the computer on again, I uninstalled the game.Pwninator score: 2/10			"

												Very atmopsheric and creepy.   A few frustrating moments.   The first time you're running away from a group of [spoilers] is tense, scary and inspires panic.  The tenth time you've done so after dying each time is just frustrating :o/  The 'no looking at the monsters whilst hiding lest you panic' mechanic is very good but spoiled by the fact that it's not too hard to kill the monsters once you get the hand of using the pickaxe (a mechanic that's initially somewhat frustrating)Overall, play Amnesia first.  If you want more after that, play this.Also, don't play if you're an arachnophobe :oP			"

												If you're looking at this game, it's most likely because you've heard of or played the famous Amnesia: The Dark Descent made by the same developers.  Penumbra: Overture is Frictional Game's first game and it definitely shares characteristics with Amnesia.The mood and style of the game is similar to Amnesia.  The lighting and eeriness of the locations set the tone of places you'd rather not be at.  Notes are scattered throughout the game, providing background history of the places you travel through.  The game is also physics based, but unlike Amnesia, you are allowed to have weapons, which does suggest that there is some form of defense.  However, the physics nature of the game requires the player to manually swing melee weapons by moving your mouse back and forth.  Nothing quite as fun as swinging in panic!  In addition to these, there are quite a bit more puzzles to solve, but nothing that is frustrating and some have satisfying complexity.If you're buying this game thinking you'll get the same experience as you did when playing Amnesia: The Dark Descent then you will be off the mark.  While it does share Amnesia's atmosphere of horror, its level of execution isn't the same.  A play through the game shows that a lot of thought went into finding ways to instill fear into the player, but it's unable to maintain the same pressure throughout the game.  If you want to get the same scares as one would get playing Amnesia, then you'll be disappointed.  But if you're interested in playing a horror game or seeing Frictional Game's earlier works, then it's worth picking up this title.			"

Good: Great atmosphere. Have to play the sequels to get a complete picture, but the story is looking great so far. It has definitely caught my interest and I'm eager to play the next game in the series.  Bad: A bit too much dragging of items around for ""puzzles"". Combat is extremely clunky; you can go towards a more stealthy approach, but killing things gives my heart peace. Much shorter than expected.  100% recommend this game. I got a STALKER vibe while exploring and I loved it. Also check out the movie ""Devil's Pass"" for more of the same vibe (it's like Stalker meets LOST).			"

												The Penumbra series was Frictional Games first series. Overture is the first game in the penumbra series, it features Phillip who is investigating a letter written from his dead father and ends up trapped in an abandoned mine. The game revolves around surviving and hiding, there are no real fighting mechanisms in the game. You can throw rocks or objects to knock out enemies (Dogs, Spiders, Infected) but after a while they will get back up again and attack you. This is a very puzzle heavy survival game, reading and taking notes are important but also some sounds can lead to become very important clues for some places. If you enjoyed Penumbra and haven't checked out Frictional games second series Amnesia, I would highly recommend it.			"

												There oughta be a law against playing this game with the lights on.  This is the first of a three-part series of games made by the guys who would then go on to make Amnesia, and the games are very similar (although completely unrelated, plot-wise).  Definitely pick this up if you want a dark (literally and figuratively), claustrophobic, tense experience.  Oh...and just because you technically get something you can use as a weapon...yeah, good luck using it that way, let me know how that works out for you.  :)			"

												This is the scariest game I have ever played. Seriosly it does everything so well: the atmosphere (including background audio), the story (including the felling of absolute loneliness while still having very interesting NPC), the setting (sooo claustrophobic), the puzzles (often based on physics) and so on. The only gripe I've got is the terrible fighting mechanic; which they luckily abandoned in future installments.			"

												Forget what all the people who don't recommend it say about horror factor in this game, this game is actually not meant to be as horror filled as Amnesia was, where-as this game was meant to play on emotion, as well as the other title, Black Plague does as well. Penumbra Overture, while people may be saying ""Has nothing to do with the main character, just this ""Red"" fellow."" it's untrue. Philip has a purpose to coming here in this frozen wasteland and pushing on, and the atmosphere is great if you have an open mind, it's dark, it's lonely, it's scary in the sense that you're trapped with nobody to help you, surrounded by death at every corner.For emotions on the other hand, there are so many things in this series that play with your emotions, they get you to love characters, only to do something to twist around your thoughts and emotions. I felt so guilty playing both in the series with how strongly I got to know and like all these characters in the games. I'll leave it at that. Want to know what was so tear-jerking? Play the game. That's all I can tell you. While the only complaint I may have for this game is being able to fight the monsters, I love the puzzles, (And I'll admit, I actually do love fighting the dogs.), I just overall love this game so much. Again. Just play this game. It's amazing. (Play Black Plague too!)			"

												Dude... This game is awesome.Well, it's awesome, if you like to get scared.This game ACTUALLY made me go ""Oh god, wtf... oh god... OH GOD! GET AWAY FROM ME! GODOGDODGODGODGODGODG JESUS CHRIST HOLY-- holy... jesus.""Then there was this time where I was running and way like ""GOD OH GOD!"" and screaming and stuff, then my friend decided to say in my ear in that creepy a** voice of his ""Run, run, as fast as you can! You can't escape me, I'm the gingerbread man!"" and I was like ""SHUT THE HELL UP!""This game... is... in my opinion... SCARIER THAN AMNESIA. Amnesia is more of the psycological horror, and there are those zombie things, but it's just... unsettling. Penumbra, is that, PLUS a freaky a** dog that is HALF MAULED, AND creepy notes everywhere that say things like ""I came down here with four of my colleges and learned a few things..."" then later it says ""...and humans are tasty."" And you know what is next to that note? A big stain of blood... alright?... And two pairs of BLOODY BOOTS! NOT COOL MAN! And when you read this note, guess what you're hiding from? THE FREAKING DEMONIC HALF-EATEN DOG!!So yeah. Creepy atmosphere, freaky scary creatures, and it ACTUALLY managed to scary me. ME! I'M the one, who laughs at people when they say that Slender is scary. I'M the one, who reasons with people to say that Amnesia isn't very scary, but it's pretty startling.The devs knew what they were doing. The story is pretty good, too. The graphics... They're good for what they use it for, and for 2007, but it's really not that great, and I notice texture glitches everywhere.Bottom line is, if you like to get scared, this game is for YOU.			"

Being the predecessor of Amnesia it beats the living CRAP out of it in all ways; atmosphere (seriously, crawling on your hands and knees with no weapons, dogs howling around you while you're losing your sanity is intense), music (there is none, which I love, it brings a whole new level to insufferable solitary) and the plot. The monsters in the game aren't the typical 'le slender face' either, just dogs, spiders and demons, the simplicity makes it even more terrifying and certainly plays on your fear of the unknown.			"

												This game is great, as long as you know what you're getting into.If you're looking for a plethora of things to kill and ways to kill them, this is not the game for you. The few ""weapons"" you encounter are tools that are used more for their intended purposes than they are for slaughter. Most of the time you're better off just running away from combat, as the tools don't do much damage anyway.The atmosphere and the creativity of this game make it an experience that differs from the norm, and this is the real reason to play it. The setting is very eerie and a nod to old survival horror games, placing more emphasis on survival than conflict. The sound effects can be very unsettling, and the ever-present snarls of the wild dogs send a chill up your spine. While not ""scary"" in the traditional sense, there are moments where the game will leave you with a distinct feeling of unease. The puzzles can be somewhat difficult at times, but you can't help but admire their creativity and thought-provoking nature. Notes and letters are more than just collectibles here. Many of them are vital to puzzle-solving and advancement, so make sure you read everything you encounter and pay close attention to clues.Considering you get both games in a $10.00 package, it's definitely a great value. Though if you don't mind waiting, I picked mine up during a sale for 50% less, which made it even more worthwhile.Admittedly, I have yet to finish the game. But I'm several hours in and I would already recommend it to those who enjoy a straight-up adventure game as opposed to the ever popular shoot-em-up. Looking forward to finishing this up and moving on to the follow-up, ""Black Plague"", which I'm told is even better.			"

He worked at some mining complex at Greenland and that is the place the game starts right with the entrance to the pit at the gameâs cover. In the next 4 chapters you delve deeper and deeper to reveal the strange and frightening secrets of this place. Along your journey you find various items to use and even some weapons which you desperately need: this place is haunted by zombie-like dogs, gigantic worms and spiders the size of racoons. Eventually you discover excavations from alien origin and make contact to the sole survivor of this place: âRedâ which apparently has gone mad.As the game was created by Frictional Games the mechanics are very, very similar to Amnesia. This game is older and when playing you can see the polish the developers did to Amnesia.Compared to Amnesia this game letâs you actually kill your enemies, though it is a though job. Which is sorta strange, since the game changes dramatically once you know how to kill all these dogs in the corridors. Then the dominant opponent turns into a âpiece of cakeâ and whatâs left are the riddles to solve. However getting a grip on these Zombie-Dogs is not an easy task and it takes you several (!) attempts to figure out how to get rid of them.I can imagine why they dropped the possibility to kill enemies in Amnesia: here the game stops been frightening at this point.The riddles in the game are of different qualities. Some are stupidly easy and for some you simply get false hints, which is bad. I remember myself in chapter 4 been chased by a big worm. The game tells you to â â¦ to seal that doorâ. Right then you find a crate on the right side. When I jumped up the crate I couldnât reach the door mechanics, but the worm didnât appear. So I thought Iâm on the right place and tried over and over and over and over to get somewhere from that position. Wrong! I needed to simply push a button on the left side of the door! And sealing the door didnât help either â¦Such quirks appear occasionally in the game: game mechanics great, story telling nice, riddles range from childish to misleading.Still, walking the strange mine renders some nice and creepy impressions, 7/10.

												I absolutly love the Penumbra series, and this one is where it all began.  I will miss Penumbra dearly.  If anyone from Fristional Games sees this i hope you are going to spread the news that im sure many many people would want... to make one more Penumbra.  Again thank you for making a brilliant game way before Amnesia.			"

												I picked this up with the first Humble Indie Bundle.  I already owned World of Goo from the bundle but hadnât heard of any of the others.  This one sounded like it might be similar to the Thief series, and it didnât disappoint!  Best played alone at night with the lights off, this game has you exploring a dark, dangerous old mine to find out what happened to your father.  This game is highly likely to startle and eventually disturb you.  If you already have it through the Bundle and havenât tried it you should absolutely check it out!  I even recommend buying it â Steam has it for $9.99 and itâs well worth it.			"

												Penumbra Overture is the first horror game, and game in general Frictional Games made, and it's a perfect start!Story-In Penumbra Overture you play as Phillip, a 30 year old male Physics Teacher.Phillip, after his mother's funeral, gets a letter from his father, which contained ""pleas of forgiveness"", but also the location of a bank Phillip had no clue exsisted, including instructions to destroy several documents that are held in said bank. When Phillip goes to pick them up, but he reads them rather than destroy them, because of human curiosity, and due to this he investigates more, eventually leading Phillip to leave his home on a ""grand"" adventure.I'm not going to say anything else, The rest can only be learned if YOU buy the game and play it!Gameplay-In Penumbra you have a few ""options"" to combat the enemies (mostly dogs) that stand in your way.The game tells you that hiding and being sneaky is the only real option, however depending on the difficulty you CAN kill the enemies (which is a BIG flaw IMO) with hammers, dynamite, and more. While trying to avoid the enemies (or jumping around because you killed them all) you have to solve puzzles, and go to different locations. The puzzles are usually easy, I rarely found myself looking up solutions to them, as normally the answers are told to you if you READ THE INFORMATION THE GAME GIVES YOU. Make sure you ALWAYS search a room/area indepth.I can't really think of anything else to say about the game, It's an amazing game, and a perfect start for Frictional Games, there are 2 more games in the Penumbra Series... Black Plague, and Reqium.I recommend you get this game if your a fan of horror, adventure, puzzles, or you are a fan of Frictional Games!Always remember""If fate frowns, we all perish""			"

												This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. I played Amnesia, read that this was the predecessor, but Amnesia is a few order of magnitude above this crap. The start is enought to make you shake your head - you start by leaving a boat, you go somewhere into the snowy wastelands, you're minutes from freezing to death, but you randomly find a hatch into the relevant mine. Noone was there for years, but the hatch is accessible and you manage to get in...After exploring a bit inside, you get into a room and you character tells you to bar the door, in case the demon dog thingy prowling there cpmes in behind you. So you drag a huge barrel to the door, place a heavy stone or two on top and the dog simply smashes all of it to pieces. And here's when I stopped. You see, in Amnesia, you have no possibility to kill the monsters, you can only hide. But the point is, hiding works, unlike thisâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ You have a hammer in your inventory with which you can, in theory, kill the dog. But swining the hammer is so awful, you can barely smash a crate. As a combat mechanic, is completely and utterly useless. If you can't hide from the dog and you can't fight the dog, the only thing you can di is uninstall.			"

												First chapter of the Penumbra Series.After a mysterious note from his passed away dad, containing clues. Philip (protagonist) sets out to Northern Greenland to find out more about this mystery and the past of his father. I like the fact that the game takes place in Greenland. Deep down in a long abandoned mine. A very unique choice for a location. Being a with snow covered uninhabited place makes a perfect set for a horror game.The beginning of the game got me right on spot. The story started off rather sad but had me curious about what was next. Was rather vague at first but piece by piece it started to connect. Not to forget that this is part 1 and part 2 will give even more depth to the story.Every level has a couple rooms that contain valuable information and/or objects that you require to venture further. In between these rooms there are dark halls and corridors with danger lurking around every corner.  Some levels have some very difficult puzzles that took me a while to figure out. It felt like an accomplishment each time I managed to solve a clue and make progress.According to the developers, playing in the middle of the night with headphones will grant you a full immersive experience. I did as they say and it sucked me right in. Psychological horror at its finest. Not a lot of jumpscares to freak but mostly the atmosphere. And spiders. :) Have fun "

												This is the first and, I'd say, best game in the Penumbra trilogy. It is appropriately mysterious, atmospheric and kept me interested till the very end. My only gripe with it is that the challenge of the enemies does not scale well with the experience of the player, so by the end of the game they are not scary at all, more of a nuisance if anything.

												Pros: Very immersive, almost no hud. Does a very good job at making intense chase scenes, require you to think on your feet and not just simply 'run away fast enough'.Puzzles are significantly more complex than amnesia's. Lots of interatable items.Cons: Has a weapon mechanic, which leads to some good puzzles and chase scenes, but also allows killing of monsters. The mechanics of using weapons are also really bad in some cases.Requires the second game to get full experince.Requires finding very specific items, which if not found quickly could result in you searching for hours for them, only to look it up online and find you threw a couch cusion over it. I would recommend Black Plague over Overture, but both games are solid story-driven horror games. Combined, Overture and Black Plague make for a scarier experince than amnesia IMO. If you have really bad arachnophobia, it may be a bit unsettling to know that spiders are very common in the game.			"

												This game is great, as long as you know what you're getting into.If you're looking for a plethora of things to kill and ways to kill them, this is not the game for you. The few ""weapons"" you encounter are tools that are used more for their intended purposes than they are for slaughter. Most of the time you're better off just running away from combat, as the tools don't do much damage anyway.The atmosphere and the creativity of this game make it an experience that differs from the norm, and this is the real reason to play it. The setting is very eerie and a nod to old survival horror games, placing more emphasis on survival than conflict. The sound effects can be very unsettling, and the ever-present snarls of the wild dogs send a chill up your spine. While not ""scary"" in the traditional sense, there are moments where the game will leave you with a distinct feeling of unease. The puzzles can be somewhat difficult at times, but you can't help but admire their creativity and thought-provoking nature. Notes and letters are more than just collectibles here. Many of them are vital to puzzle-solving and advancement, so make sure you read everything you encounter and pay close attention to clues.Considering you get both games in a $10.00 package, it's definitely a great value. Though if you don't mind waiting, I picked mine up during a sale for 50% less, which made it even more worthwhile.Admittedly, I have yet to finish the game. But I'm several hours in and I would already recommend it to those who enjoy a straight-up adventure game as opposed to the ever popular shoot-em-up. Looking forward to finishing this up and moving on to the follow-up, ""Black Plague"", which I'm told is even better.			"

												With poor visual appeal, the whole game just screams ""LOW PRODUCTION VALUES"" when compared to contemporary titles.However, far from it for Penumbra to succumb to low-production values on every front, the voice acting of the characters is phenomenal. Coupled with the game's inherently interesting plot (for those who simply can't walk away from a narrative like this) Penumbra boasts a wonderfully well-written and well-made storyline.It brings complex puzzle-solving gameplay with a pall of eeriness cast upon the game that leaves you wanting to take a few steps back every time you make one step forward.In addition to this, right from the beginning, for those interested at all in analytics, the game harps, rather subtly, on human nature. Howard, Philip, Red, all well-animated characters (figuratively speaking... of course) provide the game with a less-than-subtle hint of humanity.All in all one of the most well intriguing and captivating games I've played in quite some time.

But wait, its not just snow, there is also ICE! After a blizzard that nearly freezes you colder then a cave man you find a door. Its not just any old door though, this door is heated (how else could you open it). Now, you are in a stange hallway with a flickering light! How scary!

												I've seen a lot of criticism directed towards this game due to the combat systen. This is a survival horror, it should be difficult to fight back against enemies, and it should make you feel like avoiding them is the best option. This game does that perfectly. The physics in this game are fantastic, the puzzle solving feels very intuitive, and the narrative is gripping. The game doesn't rely on traditional jump scares, instead it utilizes it's environment, the exposition of the story, and the constant fear of what may be following you. This game is honeslty more than worth it's price, and it's a concise game. Well worth playing for any horror fans.			"

												Penumbra: Overture is a first person adventure/stealth game for cynophobics: you can sneak past the dogs or if you really, really hate the beasts you can sneak behind them with a pickaxe and bash them to death by wildly flailing your mouse around and hoping it hits something. Given how clumsy this was, the developers abandoned combat in the sequel and everything they've made since. This is either their great discovery that revolutionized horror gaming or a gigantic mistake that led to the genre abandoning resource management and becoming a puddle of samey, poorly-designed walking simulators with bad lighting.Regardless, it still nails the sensation of being trapped in a not-quite abandoned Greenland mine, at least to someone who has never been to Greenland or lived off dead spiders and dog meat in a mine shaft (if you have by any chance experienced either of these and feel that I am mistaken, feel free to let me know). If this sounds appealing to you and you don't mind the possibility of having to load someone else's save after the game refuses to acknowledge that you plugged a power cable in properly, you will probably enjoy Penumbra: Overture whether it spooks you or not.Also, pay attention to the store page's screenshots. They reveal some enemy encounters ahead of time while also picturing several that never actually happen in the game just to keep you on edge. Stuff like this is brilliant and I'm surprised there aren't more horror games that do this. "

												For those of you who have played Amnesia, this is much like it- execpt you can actually fight, albeit with rather ineffective weapons such as a hammer. That's right. Though it isn't the 200 pound battlehammer that one might be expecting.For those of you who haven't, well, it's a horror game.Long story short, it's set in the early 2000s. There's this guy named Phillip, whose father goes missing around the time of his birth and whose mother dies some time after. Phillip grows up and, after 30-ish years, gets a letter from his father, who is supposedly dead. Anyway, he becomes obsessed and tries to find him. His biggest lead is an abandoned mine in Greenland.That's where the game begins. Phillip- the main character- wanders through the cold, desolate and hostile mine, searching for answers. Along the way, you can find letters and things like that explaining the backstory of what's going on. The game is pretty creepy, although playing it with a walkthrough in an open tab, the lights on and having other people around makes it much less scary than it could be otherwise. I don't think it's as scary as some other games, especially the sequel, Penumbra: the Black Plague, but it certainly is a good game. My only problem is some parts, especially the puzzles, can be a little frustrating at times. It's okay to check a walkthrough for the hardest things, but don't use one as a crutch like I did.			"

												The Penumbra Series is BRILLIANT!!! The graphics hold up even almost 8 years later. The story is amazing! There's good scares and great puzzles that make the series challenging. The best part about these games is the gameplay mechanics. The physics puzzles are great and even something as simple as opening a door is immensely satisfying and adds greatly to the realism and immersion into the creepy, frigid underground world. If you like the Amnesia games, get the original!			"

												The practicality of its puzzles is P:O's strong point. The problems and their solutions all feel firmly rooted in the world you are exploring, and solving them elicits a nod of satisfaction for their intuitiveness. Beyond that, the gameplay is rather lacking. The enemies that can be combatted present zero threat or challenge, resulting in a severe lack of tension throughout the journey. Fortunately the exploration and mystery is the far bigger draw and well worth a playthrough.			"

												Although it has taken me a little more than 5hrs to finish this game, it seemed like a very long time. From the moment I clicked ""New Game"" I was detached from earthly boundaries. At first I was scared and jumpy, but after a while I thought ""enough"", I got up and killed that damned zombie-dog, and it was so satisfying. I strongly recommend this game for anyone in need of some of that horror rush. Remember kids: Badly Administered Dopamine Clouds Frequently Everything.			"

												Wow!  Just beat this game and that's about all I can say is wow.  It was awesome!  I just glanced at the first couple of reviews and noticed they're negative reviews complaining about the combat style and I guess non-intuitiveness? of the control scheme, and I have to say, I do agree if you're playing it on a traditional monitor/screen.  But I just played the whole game on my Oculus CV1 thanks to the VR mod and it's truly amazing.  The genius modder, Joseph Delgado, definitely deserves props for this one!  Some notes on the VR mod:  It fully supports Oculus Touch (even though he wrote it for and with the HTC Vive in mind), however, it does require a 360 degree setup (3 sensors) because there is no turning mechanism (snap turning or otherwise).  But with 3 sensors in 360 setup, it's nothing short of fantastic.  The only issue is Philip doesn't jump as high or far in the VR mod since the modder did something kind of screwy with the gravity I believe.  I didn't actually play the game in 2D before I jumped into VR so I didn't know any better until I found 2 spots in the game where it was completely unpassable in the VR mod due to not being able to jump far enough.  Once I realized I just played those 2 parts on my desktop real quick and once it gave me a save point, I went back to VR and it only happened twice.So for the rest of my review on the game, I want to point out that these devs really knew how to make a great game.  It has everything from compelling story, crazy atmospheric gameplay, sounds, and the list goes on.  This is a gem of a game.  I'm kind of torn on whether I should play the next Penumbra game since there is no VR mod for it, or just wait for the source code to be released so another fine soul can add VR support.  Hell, even though this is an old game by now, it might prove a good idea for the original devs to add VR support for this series and gain some recognition and reputation for a future game/series hopefully built for VR as well.  Just food for though.  Anyway, 2 Thumbs Up!			"

												I have seen several let's plays of this game and now that I have played it myself I have realized a few things.-Compared to Amnesia: the Dark Descent the controls were a little sloppy (for me at least), if not, it was at least not the most efficient set up. (Now this isn't so much as a negative system, but it might be too efficient causing to no longer be efficient).-The only story of this game is: get through the mines. Now while you traverse the mines and caves you get hints at what the next game will hold. Red also explains what has happened and what is still happening. Now ... to actually get or say this has any plot to it: you have to read the notes, and listen to Red.-Another comparison to Amnesia: the Dark Descent is in this game you almost never have a time of absolute darkness to where you cannot see in front of you. -Although the puzzles were good and some were very easy; unless you have seen someone else, have maps of the game, or even have a walkthrough ... there are no initiatives for directions of how to work the puzzles (although Red does help a little it is very easy to miss his times of speech especially when being chased or if you are in hiding). There or the ""To Do""'s but unless you have clicked on something that requires reminding, it is very unhelpful/useless.-Now this game is the first commercially released game that Frictional Games has done and therefore deserves a high rating of amazement from an avid gamer to the company. I definitely recommend this game to others who are looking for a game to play.			"

												I'm gonna be honest here. This was one of the first games I ever bought on Steam back in 2011. Being an idiot, I never really got past it. Well, I decided to sit down this weekend and try and actually finish it. Wasn't hard. I did it. Penumbra: Overture is a good game. As a horror game, eh...For someone who hasn't really played horror games all that much, this was a pretty ok start. Penumbra follows the adventures of a young man as he travels to Greenland upon his dead father's request. When he gets there, a storm hits and he is forced to take shelter in an old mine. Bad idea, as the mine has it's own little messed up histrory. Pros:-Interesting story-Decent graphics-Very atmospheric-Pretty ok puzzles (especially for people not good at them)Cons:-Not very scary when you can just kill the enemies...Really thats it. The enemies can be killed pretty easily and early on. It really kills the mood and prevents it from being a great horror gameRating: 8/10 "

												About 30 minutes into the playthrough, I was being terrorized by a dog with glowing eyes that really thought I was made of bacon. I finally got to a door, and closed it behind me, thinking that the dog couldn't get through. I was wrong. The dog broke down the door and I nearlyâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥myself. In my panic, I picked up a rock and threw it at the dog; it fell down, got back up, and then wimpered away. ""huh,"" I thought, ""I guess that was all I had to do?"" the answer was no. The dog quickly changed its mind and came running towards me. I panicked and hit the dog once more with the rock. It just did the same thing again, and I was getting desperate. I hit it once more, and when it was down, began bashing it in the head over and over again with the rock (doing this by moving my mouse up and down quickly) and then... the dog died. I really did not expect that.10/10 game lets me kill the scary bad guy with a rock.			"

												Run from the dogs: The SimulatorHaven't played Penumbra games as first Frictional game I played was ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"", which I really liked a lot. So going back to older Frictional games was quite odd.Anyhow, game is horror'wise quite weak and the ""combat"" is just horrific, but the storytelling & puzzles make up for it. Considering this is first frictional games game & it's almost 10 years old then this game is quite good. So obviously it isn't as polished gameplay'wise nor looks as amazing in comparison to newer Frictional games  titles, but that was a great start and there are 2 more chapters to this game.Though i found it easier to run & lead dogs rather than avoiding them altogether.Seriously.. those damn dogs..Ending was somewhat sad as well.Want a game with interesting Puzzles & Story then sure, play this game.In a nutshell:+Interesting story+Great puzzles+Fitting atmosphere-Isn't as ""scary"" as hoped for-Horrific combat7/10			"

												With poor visual appeal, the whole game just screams ""LOW PRODUCTION VALUES"" when compared to contemporary titles.However, far from it for Penumbra to succumb to low-production values on every front, the voice acting of the characters is phenomenal. Coupled with the game's inherently interesting plot (for those who simply can't walk away from a narrative like this) Penumbra boasts a wonderfully well-written and well-made storyline.It brings complex puzzle-solving gameplay with a pall of eeriness cast upon the game that leaves you wanting to take a few steps back every time you make one step forward.In addition to this, right from the beginning, for those interested at all in analytics, the game harps, rather subtly, on human nature. Howard, Philip, Red, all well-animated characters (figuratively speaking... of course) provide the game with a less-than-subtle hint of humanity.All in all one of the most well intriguing and captivating games I've played in quite some time.

												After completeing this title a little over 5 months ago (After putting it off for a long time) --- I can quite honestly say: if you haven't played it, please do... Being the same developer, it is the direct spiritual predeccesor of Amnesia and, quite frankly, brought Amnesia to it's success. Without the technology developed from this small series, we wouldn't be experiencing the horrifying, dark, immersive 3D experience that we know today. This game never got that much credit, where much credit is due. I would LOVE to live to the day where survival horror saw more games akin to this. If you REALLY want the pants scared off of you - I'd highly recommend it's successor - Black Plague. 10$, you can't beat that price for such a beautifully crafted masterpiece.			"

												Maybe it's because I've been so spoiled playing Amnesia Dark Descent and Outlast... but this game only spooked me a little bit. The puzzles and figuring out things was fun... but the creatures among the puzzles were just annoying after a while. A couple things did take me by surprise, but over all... I was kind of disappointed.Story line? ""oh where is everyone? oh what happened to my dad? oh what are these weird lanterns? oh how do i get out""I finished this game in under 6 hours.Bug report: early on in the game I had my grab/interact mouse disappear on me. Had to restart.Controlling was very easy for the most part. Keyboard and mouse. The ONE thing that bothered me the most was having to shake my mouse like an idiot just to swing a hammer or a pick-axe. -.-Motionsickness? Yes, unfortunately. I think the repetative tight corridors and looking around for clues is what did me in.Would I recommend this? Well... maybe. I don't know. Personally, if you want a game not as scary as Amnesia DD, then sure... but if you are really looking for loads of OH GOD MY HEART! then... I'd actually say skip it. o_o Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad. it just wasn't great.I think maybe I will recommend if you're kind of looking for a horror game to quickly pass the time OR if you scare really easily. Just maybe get it on sale.Here is hoping Penumbra Black Plague will be scarier.			"

												""The Penumbra Series"" was created by Frictional Games. As many know, they are the creaters of the none-stop famous ""Amnesia Series"". I first started off with ""Amnesia The Dark Decent"", then ""Amnesia A Machine For Pigs""before ever playing Penumbra. I haven't seen any play throughs on Penumbra (nore Amnesia at the time) because I love to be suprised, and love to figure things out myself. With Penumbra, it take almost if not EXACTLY the same game mechanics as Amnesia! Just slightly different in very VERY small ways. And with that being said, that's not a bad thing! I know I may be a tad bit late to review this game since it's been out for quite sometime. I haven't even beaten the game just yet, but I am pretty far, and already I love it! I am thankful that Frictional games takes a good notice at their Mac users (cause i'm a Mac user) and gaming on my Macbook Pro isn't that bad at all. The game runs fairly smooth, and doesn't lag at all. I am impressed with the Story Line as well (which I think most people don't care about in these Phsychological Horror Games.) The story is one thing that makes these games what they are! Very mystical, quite a few jump scares here and there, and it's even better when all lights are off. I have yet to play the other ones (which I did purchase) and am so anxious! I would recomend this game to any Horror Game fan, or someone who just flat out wants a good scare here and there, with a few mid to hard puzzles to solve. I would give this game a 10/10.			"

												Let's get one thing out of the way first: I'd reccomended this game based solely on the experince and story alone and the cheap price ($10 for the bundle with it as well as it's sequels) only sweetens the deal. The graphics, atmosphere, sound design, and story are all top notch. This is also pretty much the game that started the exploration heavy and combat-light based gameplay-style for indie-horror that Amnesia later codified. I DO have some complaints about the gameplay machanics that anyone thinking of buying this should now about, though:*The combat is clunky and barely responsive. I can see that were going for for a immerisve and substansal feeling system with interaction beyond clicking a button to swing, but it was implemented horribly. It consists of holding the action button to ready yourself, and using the mouse to swing but it takes such broad movements that it's hard to hit anything and good luck lining up enemies when they can simply step out of your hitzone because you obiously can't move the camera while holding the action button.*I won't post spoilers here, but some of the puzzles violate common sense or rely to much on really diffcult trial and error along with memorization. Some also do downright underhanded things like requiring you know morse-code with nothing but a code-sheet and no indication how to tell dashes from dots.Normally I'd trash this game, but the story and art design made up for the short-comings in the gameplay and made worth powering through to the end.

												About 30 minutes into the playthrough, I was being terrorized by a dog with glowing eyes that really thought I was made of bacon. I finally got to a door, and closed it behind me, thinking that the dog couldn't get through. I was wrong. The dog broke down the door and I nearlyâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥myself. In my panic, I picked up a rock and threw it at the dog; it fell down, got back up, and then wimpered away. ""huh,"" I thought, ""I guess that was all I had to do?"" the answer was no. The dog quickly changed its mind and came running towards me. I panicked and hit the dog once more with the rock. It just did the same thing again, and I was getting desperate. I hit it once more, and when it was down, began bashing it in the head over and over again with the rock (doing this by moving my mouse up and down quickly) and then... the dog died. I really did not expect that.10/10 game lets me kill the scary bad guy with a rock.			"

												For those of you who have played Amnesia, this is much like it- execpt you can actually fight, albeit with rather ineffective weapons such as a hammer. That's right. Though it isn't the 200 pound battlehammer that one might be expecting.For those of you who haven't, well, it's a horror game.Long story short, it's set in the early 2000s. There's this guy named Phillip, whose father goes missing around the time of his birth and whose mother dies some time after. Phillip grows up and, after 30-ish years, gets a letter from his father, who is supposedly dead. Anyway, he becomes obsessed and tries to find him. His biggest lead is an abandoned mine in Greenland.That's where the game begins. Phillip- the main character- wanders through the cold, desolate and hostile mine, searching for answers. Along the way, you can find letters and things like that explaining the backstory of what's going on. The game is pretty creepy, although playing it with a walkthrough in an open tab, the lights on and having other people around makes it much less scary than it could be otherwise. I don't think it's as scary as some other games, especially the sequel, Penumbra: the Black Plague, but it certainly is a good game. My only problem is some parts, especially the puzzles, can be a little frustrating at times. It's okay to check a walkthrough for the hardest things, but don't use one as a crutch like I did.			"

												    Interesting enough game to keep you hooked. My BIG complaint is the programming of the mellee weapon attack. It IS hideous, really. That...coupled with having to un-equip a mellee weapon before you can interact with objects or function buttons/activations really makes things very awkward. Even though these are 1 handed weapons you still can't press a button, grab a door?? It seems like the game wants you to use environmental mechanics to deal with deadly creatures...but that very odd equip...un-equip combo in the heat of battle gets very annoying & makes things a ton more 'fingers & thumbs' than they need to be.    Base generic enemies too. But, otherwise a goodish time... :-)  Only recommended when on sale. I think I paid $2-$3 for all 3 games...so yeah good for that...any more...not sure... "

Save points are quite few and far between so beware, if something seems off and you've already tried everything, then its most probably glitched and you will need to reload.

												It's good and pretty scary, until you find out how easily you can kill all the dogs and bypass all the threats. It's essentially a survival horror stealth game with one of the most clunkiest inefficient combat systems out there that is purposely bad to make you feel utterly hopeless. A great idea to drive the horror with poor combat, sort of like how Resident Evil took use of the bad camera angles to gimp and make the characters have a weakness. However, poorly executed, could be way better if the combat is scrapped entirely or gimped even more.Ignoring all the flaws, it's still a very good horror game.			"

The sound design and graphics are quite good and the story is compelling enough to keep making you want to play it; delve ever deeper (literally) into the mine that the first part of this series (Overture) almost entirely takes place in.   Also, the puzzles and game play mechanics (such as being able to smash open a locked chest or closed door with a hammer or pick + having a glow stick, a flashlight, and even flares at your disposal to light your way, are all great features as well)Can't wait to play the rest of the series!

Frictional games, creators of the critically acclaimed Amnesia: The Dark Descent made this Penumbra a few years before ATDD, and it doesn't disappoint!Scary atmosphere, and compelling scriptwriting make it a joy to play. The plot isn't particularly believable, but which horror game plot is nowadays. The controls feel a little clunky at times, and the combat system (which was thankfully done away with in Penumbra: Black Plague) is entirely optional, meaning you can attempt stealth playthroughs of the game.Grab the collection if its on sale, its worth the price!8/10!

												I love horror games, especially first person horror games, and I REALLY wish I could write a better review for this one. I understand a game where the atmosphere is important, that's what gives the game immersion. All Penumbra: Overture had was immerson techniques used by lights, textures and audio. I thought that in itself was really cool, and halfway through playing I was wondering when the ""scares"" were going to happen. They never came. It took me four hours to get through this game because I wanted to get everything I could out of it. Overture is not a bad game in any means, but it lacks what every horror game needs: horror. I'd still recommend it, though. Just because it wasn't for me doesn't mean it won't hopefully scare someone else's socks off! If you choose to get it, have fun! However, if you're aso wondering why there aren't any scares, play through it for the experience. 4/10 for me :(			"

												A predecessor to the (in)famous Amnesia, Penumbra is a diamond in the rough that incites fear through storytelling and some fine voice acting rather than the overuse of jump-scares and B-movie cliches.  What results from this great narrative is a short but truly discomorting game where the fear comes from the pervading sense of dread as you delve deeper venture the mine and uncover more of its backstory.  Though this game is dated in appearance, anyone who found Amnesia to be entertaining will likely feel at home with this game, with the physics based puzzles and Frictional's unique take on horror first established here. After nearly 8 years it still stands strong.			"

												I came to this game way after both Amnesia so I had a little idea of what to expect even if it wouldn't be as polished as the later game.I wouldn't say the atmosphere is all that scary compared to Amnesia, but the sense of exploration and piecing the story together yourself is much the same. The certainly isn't a game you just blaze through. If you don't spend the time reading the notes and such left around and immersing yourself in the lore you'll find the game a bit empty.The good: intriguing early story; some smart puzzles; manual interaction with doors et al for good sense of immersion.The bad: a bit ""was that it?"" at the end (though obviously this is only the setup to the rest of the series); lack of variety in enemies; controlling the tools/weapons can be a bit obtuse.

												The practicality of its puzzles is P:O's strong point. The problems and their solutions all feel firmly rooted in the world you are exploring, and solving them elicits a nod of satisfaction for their intuitiveness. Beyond that, the gameplay is rather lacking. The enemies that can be combatted present zero threat or challenge, resulting in a severe lack of tension throughout the journey. Fortunately the exploration and mystery is the far bigger draw and well worth a playthrough.			"

												Very atmopsheric and creepy.   A few frustrating moments.   The first time you're running away from a group of [spoilers] is tense, scary and inspires panic.  The tenth time you've done so after dying each time is just frustrating :o/  The 'no looking at the monsters whilst hiding lest you panic' mechanic is very good but spoiled by the fact that it's not too hard to kill the monsters once you get the hand of using the pickaxe (a mechanic that's initially somewhat frustrating)Overall, play Amnesia first.  If you want more after that, play this.Also, don't play if you're an arachnophobe :oP			"

												Alright so Penumbra is Pretty scary even if you set your Brightness to high because it uses Horror Noises and Scares to Scare theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥out of the Player. It's Very good but not the kind of game i would play often because you can not defend yourself very well in this game and the Other two, Black Plague and Requiem you arent able to defend yourself at all.

												A predecessor to the (in)famous Amnesia, Penumbra is a diamond in the rough that incites fear through storytelling and some fine voice acting rather than the overuse of jump-scares and B-movie cliches.  What results from this great narrative is a short but truly discomorting game where the fear comes from the pervading sense of dread as you delve deeper venture the mine and uncover more of its backstory.  Though this game is dated in appearance, anyone who found Amnesia to be entertaining will likely feel at home with this game, with the physics based puzzles and Frictional's unique take on horror first established here. After nearly 8 years it still stands strong.			"

												This game is really great. I must say this game for it's time is awesome, compared to Amnesia it is not all that much, but what can you expect since this game was created earlier. Penumbra really leaves you wanting more.Penumbra is different from Amnesia, since you have weapons and can fight. It is a different experience that should be played. The fight mechanics are a little wonky and some of the puzzles are a bit odd, but it still is a great game. Overall I think Penumbra Overture gets a 8.9/10 "

												""The Penumbra Series"" was created by Frictional Games. As many know, they are the creaters of the none-stop famous ""Amnesia Series"". I first started off with ""Amnesia The Dark Decent"", then ""Amnesia A Machine For Pigs""before ever playing Penumbra. I haven't seen any play throughs on Penumbra (nore Amnesia at the time) because I love to be suprised, and love to figure things out myself. With Penumbra, it take almost if not EXACTLY the same game mechanics as Amnesia! Just slightly different in very VERY small ways. And with that being said, that's not a bad thing! I know I may be a tad bit late to review this game since it's been out for quite sometime. I haven't even beaten the game just yet, but I am pretty far, and already I love it! I am thankful that Frictional games takes a good notice at their Mac users (cause i'm a Mac user) and gaming on my Macbook Pro isn't that bad at all. The game runs fairly smooth, and doesn't lag at all. I am impressed with the Story Line as well (which I think most people don't care about in these Phsychological Horror Games.) The story is one thing that makes these games what they are! Very mystical, quite a few jump scares here and there, and it's even better when all lights are off. I have yet to play the other ones (which I did purchase) and am so anxious! I would recomend this game to any Horror Game fan, or someone who just flat out wants a good scare here and there, with a few mid to hard puzzles to solve. I would give this game a 10/10.			"

												I came to this game way after both Amnesia so I had a little idea of what to expect even if it wouldn't be as polished as the later game.I wouldn't say the atmosphere is all that scary compared to Amnesia, but the sense of exploration and piecing the story together yourself is much the same. The certainly isn't a game you just blaze through. If you don't spend the time reading the notes and such left around and immersing yourself in the lore you'll find the game a bit empty.The good: intriguing early story; some smart puzzles; manual interaction with doors et al for good sense of immersion.The bad: a bit ""was that it?"" at the end (though obviously this is only the setup to the rest of the series); lack of variety in enemies; controlling the tools/weapons can be a bit obtuse.

												Dude... This game is awesome.Well, it's awesome, if you like to get scared.This game ACTUALLY made me go ""Oh god, wtf... oh god... OH GOD! GET AWAY FROM ME! GODOGDODGODGODGODGODG JESUS CHRIST HOLY-- holy... jesus.""Then there was this time where I was running and way like ""GOD OH GOD!"" and screaming and stuff, then my friend decided to say in my ear in that creepy a** voice of his ""Run, run, as fast as you can! You can't escape me, I'm the gingerbread man!"" and I was like ""SHUT THE HELL UP!""This game... is... in my opinion... SCARIER THAN AMNESIA. Amnesia is more of the psycological horror, and there are those zombie things, but it's just... unsettling. Penumbra, is that, PLUS a freaky a** dog that is HALF MAULED, AND creepy notes everywhere that say things like ""I came down here with four of my colleges and learned a few things..."" then later it says ""...and humans are tasty."" And you know what is next to that note? A big stain of blood... alright?... And two pairs of BLOODY BOOTS! NOT COOL MAN! And when you read this note, guess what you're hiding from? THE FREAKING DEMONIC HALF-EATEN DOG!!So yeah. Creepy atmosphere, freaky scary creatures, and it ACTUALLY managed to scary me. ME! I'M the one, who laughs at people when they say that Slender is scary. I'M the one, who reasons with people to say that Amnesia isn't very scary, but it's pretty startling.The devs knew what they were doing. The story is pretty good, too. The graphics... They're good for what they use it for, and for 2007, but it's really not that great, and I notice texture glitches everywhere.Bottom line is, if you like to get scared, this game is for YOU.			"

While it lacks a diverse cast of enemies, has somewhat repetative level design among other trivial flaws, it serves as a solid exposition to the plot.

Going against the wishes of a letter appearing to have been written posthumously by the father you never knew, you venture to the far-off, icy reaches of Greenland to discover a terrible secret. In perfect isolation, you have no one but yourself and your own wits to rely on as you creep through the mazelike underground tunnels of a forgotten outpost, abandoned 30 years before... and as you bypass obstructions and make your way deeper and deeper into the dangerous warren, you discover that you may not be alone, and that there's no turning back.

												Downloaded this game (and it's sequels) in preparation for Amnesia. A good game, (if a little short) atmospheric, puzzles can be a little irritating, but satisfactory once solved. However, combat is plonky and players should stick to stealth, I also noticed that health regenerates (I was playing on easy) I never died in the one instance of accidental direct combat. Other minor complaints are that when I started the game up I had to tinker with the graphics just get some colour and clear picture.All in all, enjoyable experience.

												To start: I used to add a longer header describing my reviewing ethos, but it made some reviews too long to submit, so I've left it on my Backloggery page.Gameplay: Odds are that if you're looking at this game, you've played the Amnesia games. They're pretty much one and the same, these series. In fact, there's such a high probability that you've played Amesia or at least seen Amnesia that I'm not going to bother going into too much depth as far as the gameplay goes. Instead, I'll just keep things shorter and compare and contrast the two. For starters, both games have an emphasis on hiding from enemies, since combat is kinda spotty at best. However, that's by design, so there's not much point whinging about that. Unlike Amnesia, you don't have to worry about sanity. The screen just goes all wibbly whenever you look at the enemy. All in all, there's three things you've gotta worry about: puppies, carnivorous spiders, and the worm. The puppies will patrol the area, but you can distract them with bits of beef jerky... sometimes. It doesn't work all the time, though; even if you've got a whole pile of jerky in front of the dog. The other two you just run away from.Puzzles are, again, very akin to Amnesia. There were a few puzzles that were kinda annoying or suffered from 90's Adventure Syndrome, but they're generally pretty alright. You can brute force a few puzzles; a favorite solution to one where you have to knock down a ladder is to build a tower of barrels. Yes, that works. I'm still surprised that it works. There wasn't really anything that blew me away as far as clever puzzle design, though. It's just pretty run of the mill puzzle design.As far as the atmosphere goes, Amesia wins by a LONG shot. There really weren't any gripping moments for me in this game. It's not bad, and to someone who's more susceptible to horror than I am, it might be quite a thrill. However, the game didn't grab me in the same way that Amnesia did. Then again, this is the first episode of the Penumbra series; maybe Black Plague can step it up a few notches. 6/10.Story: It's a pretty typical supernatural-based story. I can tell a lot of the questions the game brought up (that I didn't find myself asking, actually; the game kinda shoved the questions down my throat) are gonna be answered in later installments, but for just the first game, I didn't find myself really caring all that much. Red should have been a lot creepier of a character, but he was more of an annoyance than anything else. At the end, I didn't feel pity; I just felt relief that I wouldn't have to hear his stereotypical rambling. Also, just because your game is episodic, that doesn't mean that you've gotta have a cliffhanger. It only works if you're really invested in the series. Otherwise, it just seems silly. Oh well; at least they got better at writing by Amnesia. 5/10.Graphics: I'm quite impressed that they were able to do this much in only a ~300MB download. All of the textures look pretty good, the worlds are pretty well made, and everything just looks pretty good. Too bad that the mine environment didn't allow for much on the art style front. Enemies aren't really too interesting art design-wise, either. Certainly nothing as discomforting as Mr. No-Jaw-McGee. It does get kinda boring looking at mine section after mine section after mine section, but I guess that couldn't be helped. The game will run at 1080p easily, and I'd imagine that if you have any graphics card whatsoever, you should be able to run this game without any problems. For a fair bit of technical finesse from an indie team with an unfortunately lacking art direction, I'll give it a 3/5.Sound: Frictional has always been pretty good at sound design. While this isn't their best example of sound design capabilities, it is still a good show. It does get a bit silly and overdone at times, but for the most part, it does a pretty good job at setting the atmosphere. As far as the voice actor (singular; Red is pretty much the only one), it wasn't bad. It's only bad  that his dialogue made me get rather tired of him fast. As far as the music, there really isn't much. It does set the mood, though, so I guess there's that. 4/5.Overall scores are: 6/5/3/4; cumulative score of 5.7/10. Overall a pretty middling surivival horror game. Hopefully Black Plague picks up the pace.			"

												This Game is great for the price of $10 and the fact it comes with the games in the series is great. As for the Horror Survival part of the game is geat how if you don't feel like hiding you can walk up to an enemy and BEAT THEâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥OUT OF HIM WITH A PICKAXE. Great story though the horror is Ok because he pretty much tells you that something is comming.			"

												Very atmopsheric and creepy.   A few frustrating moments.   The first time you're running away from a group of [spoilers] is tense, scary and inspires panic.  The tenth time you've done so after dying each time is just frustrating :o/  The 'no looking at the monsters whilst hiding lest you panic' mechanic is very good but spoiled by the fact that it's not too hard to kill the monsters once you get the hand of using the pickaxe (a mechanic that's initially somewhat frustrating)Overall, play Amnesia first.  If you want more after that, play this.Also, don't play if you're an arachnophobe :oP			"

												The first of the Penumbra series and developer Fritcional Games' first commercial foray into their unique brand of horror, Overture gets the mood and sense of isolation right from the start. Your quest to discover the fate of your father in a secret base under the Greenland wastes becomes a struggle to survive a living nightmare, and if this kind of horror is for you, you'll absolutely love it.By far and away the biggest problem is the ease with which you can bludgeon most monsters to death, immediately rendering them unthreatening. Luckily, it's entirely possible (though much harder) to play the entire game without killing anything, and this need to remain hidden or face certain death infinitely ups the fear factor. The sequel, Black Plague, fixes this problem without needing to play in a particular way, but Overture can be just as terrifying with only a bit of conscious effort.Highly recommended and the game that got me into horror.From the developer of Amnesia!

												May not be as scary as say Amnesia but this is one survival horror that you shouldn't miss. Its fun, challenging and very very creepy.Combat is difficult so you can't always rely on the ""weapons"" you get, which makes the game interesting because a game isn't a horror game if you can easily fight your way through all your enemies.

												Captures the claustrophobic fear of being trapped and the madness that sets in during a gruesome struggle for survival. Fighting for your life feels clumsy and frantic at the same time: eventually I lost count of the number of zombie dogs I had wildly and desperately stabbed to death with a pickaxe. The sound design complements the atmosphere wonderfully and you will find your heart pounding in time with the ominous music before long.Puzzles are intelligent and interesting, sometimes requiring you to use your noodle to decipher codes from written clues or learn how to do something from a field manual rather than simply ""use item A on object B"".A little difficult and confusing at points but definitely worth a playthrough!

												About 30 minutes into the playthrough, I was being terrorized by a dog with glowing eyes that really thought I was made of bacon.

In my panic, I picked up a rock and threw it at the dog; it fell down, got back up, and then wimpered away. ""huh,"" I thought, ""I guess that was all I had to do?"" the answer was no. The dog quickly changed its mind and came running towards me. I panicked and hit the dog once more with the rock. It just did the same thing again, and I was getting desperate. I hit it once more, and when it was down, began bashing it in the head over and over again with the rock (doing this by moving my mouse up and down quickly) and then... the dog died. I really did not expect that.10/10 game lets me kill the scary bad guy with a rock.			"

												I highly recommend this game.  It's the forerunner to Amnesia, and I think the more interesting game.  I like the plot better, the location is also more interesting.  Make sure you get all three acts, because it's not until the end that the developers really figure out how to do everything right, and it's fun to see their progression as you get more and more terrified.  Great plot, horrifying gameplay, nice puzzles.			"

												I never thought I'd like a horror survival game, but this was great fun! The gameplay mechanics used in this game are fantastic and I wish more games used that style. The storyline was quite good too. You get led through an underground mine by a man at the end of a radio transmitter. There's enough new things to find to keep you interested. I didn't find it nearly as scary as I was expecting, but that doesn't mean to say I didn't jump every now and then. :P			"

												This game is like a FMV console horror game from Sega Saturn or Sony Playstation except it's in realtime 3d. Honestly, it shares so much with Enemy Zero or Hellnight and its more streamlined ilk. You've basically got puzzle rooms interconnected by a corridor sequence and on you go dodging death and solving puzzles.The mechanics may not have aged well, and the second chapter (Black Plague) retcons plenty out of this one, so don't get burned there. The horror premise is well-worn and the setting is honestly inspid, but it's a decent game all in all.			"

												Frictional Games' first outing.  A classic in my opinion and it made Frictional a dev I'll buy games from on release day(or earlier) and have no problem paying full price.It's not your traditional FPS.  There is some shooting but the idea is to keep confrontation to a minimum and just run the hell away from everything because it's so freaking scary that simply staring at the monsters for too long will drive you insane.  There are some pretty unique action controls that you probably haven't seen in an FPS before.  Some of it is awkward to get the hang of but it all ends up making sense just as SOMETHING IS BEHIND YOU FFS RUUUUUUN!<3 Frictional Games.			"

												Penumbra Overture is a chilling first person horror adventure that utilizes creepy lighting, music, and sounds to keep the hair on the back of your neck standing. The story isn't grade A quality, but the presentation is where it shines--revealing pieces slowly while purposely withholding information. The game isn't continuously scary, although it does offer several moments of adrenaline pumped fear as you push forward into the unknown. It offers some decent puzzles, good physical interaction, and fabulous choreography of events with sounds. Keep the lights off, the sound cranked up, and immerse yourself into its eerie atmosphere. For the best experience, combat should be avoided.			"

												The Penumbra series is one of the only horror series left in modern gaming - story driven, challenging, dark, and believe it or not, scary.  People call Doom, F.E.A.R., Dead Space, and Resident Evil 4-5 horror games even though they're no more than just shooters.  If you're looking for something more authentic and deep, then give Penumbra a try.  Remember to play them at night.			"

												It's the year 2000. Going against the wishes of a letter appearing to have been written posthumously by the father you never knew, you venture to the far-off, icy reaches of Greenland to discover a terrible secret. In perfect isolation, you have no one but yourself and your own wits to rely on as you creep through the mazelike underground tunnels of a forgotten outpost, abandoned 30 years before... and as you bypass obstructions and make your way deeper and deeper into the dangerous warren, you discover that you may not be alone, and that there's no turning back.

												Giving this game a thumbs up because the interactive physics engine is spectacular and the first hour of gameplay feels fresh and great. The puzzles are fun to get through because you can pick stuff up and toss things around. It makes the Source engine feel primitive. The sound is also done well-- dissonant soundscapes that make your skin crawl just a little bit. And these shining points are why Penumbra Overture gets a solid ""MEH"" instead of a dissentful ""GARBAGE""; read on.After the first hour or so, the game gets quite mundane. The game begins in the typical ""abandoned mine"" game trope, which is one of the worst settings there is, on par with ""the water level that's mostly swimming"". Nobody likes abandoned mine levels, we all just begrudgingly power through them hoping to get to the next area. Unfortunately there is no next area-- the whole game is in this mine. As a result the level design feels uninspired and boring.. because it is. And the one lake area that adds some dynamic to the world is a total non-sequitor.As is standard for horror, combat is terrible. We are encouraged to sneak around enemies, which does have novelty for the first hour of gameplay. After that, it's just Outlast before there was Outlast.. I grappled with the poor fighting system until I found a reliable way to exploit it and kill the dogs (almost) every time. Running from enemies doesn't increase tension. It never increases tension. It only breaks momentum. The corridors are too long to backtrack through if one has to stop and wait out the dogs, so the dogs need to be taken out back and axed. Crouch down and time your hitstuns.The spiders are poorly implemented. They can't be killed in any practical sense, and they can outrun you. It's a matter of trial and error, death and respawn, until you've brute-forced the maze to the point of memorizing the right path. There was an instance where I got check-pointed with spiders right on my tail, thus making the current objective impossible to complete. Player death was unavoidable because I hadn't previously been moving along fast enough for a sufficient head start. I had to reload an older save and use hindsight to briskly run through and make all of the correct turns.Similarly, boss battles are all one-shot kills and require fast environment interactions to get past. Once again, they're impossible to beat the first go-around. But after enough trial and error you learn where to go and what to press. It takes all the tension out of the prospect of death. Good game design involves giving the player the opportunity to analyze and deconstruct the situation in the middle of the action, but Penumbra punishes the player for slowing to look around despite it being necessary to advance.My guess is that this game was playtested only by the creators, and knowing the lay of each path, were able to breeze through with little difficulty. Uninitiated players, despite Penumbra Overture being a relatively easy game, will inevitably die at certain points in their playthrough, making death expected, accepted, and anticlimactic.Nevertheless, I still recommend buying the Penumbra Collectors Pack this Winter Sale because it comes out to only 83 cents for each game. Although most of my review was negative, it's fortunate that the majority of the game is puzzle solving with that neat physics engine. This game is worth the 83 cents, and it was fun to see where Frictional came from before I play Amnesia for the first time.			"

												This is going to be a hard review. I wish I could be neutral about it, but due to Steams review mechanics I will have to reach a verdict at the end. Oh boy. Please read carefully, especially my conclusion!Lets talk about the atmospheric, story-driven experience you are going to get out of this first. Though graphically not top-notch given the year the game was released it sets up a great, intimidating and believable atmosphere with a mysterious touch to it. Great sound assest, brilliant light effects and decent level design regarding maze-like interiors. Aesthetically everything falls into place when you consider the fact that you are an explorer going down into a mine to find secrets your father left behind. The story, while a little bit predictable, is told very well and involves the player in it.Mechanics. It is Frictional Games' first game which set a milestone in story telling gaming, which is wonderful. Not so wonderful is the fighting system, which is forced upon you when encountering enemies, like dogs or spiders. It is not like in Games like Half-Life where you bash your enemies' heads in with your crowbar while still being able to evade their attacks - no! You have to swing your melee weapons with your mouse and you control it directionally, meaning that you can swing either side: left, right, or direct push. Problem is, that your screen locks when you try to swing, so you are unable to move. This is obviously not a good idea and you might think, that it encourages sneaking. And yes, at first that is the case - but soon you are not able to avoid encounters and you will have to brawl your way through, which is frustrating in a great way. This is a big negative, since it is practically forced upon the player and you have almost no way of avoiding it or finding a way around fighting - and you will come across those situations regularly.Other mechanics work quite well. Puzzle solving is a bit tricky at times given the dated graphics, especially texture quality. For example: You find a key and don't know where to put it? It might be that pixely black mess of a texture on a control panel! This makes it quite complicated and it could use some sort of indicator, but well, it works somehow. Certainly, patience is required.ConclusionIF, only if you can withstand a large amount of depressing forced and flawed combat (I guarantee you that you will shut your game off multiple times!) and live for excellent atmosphere in every aspect, I can recommend this game. This game shows you why Amnesia was/is such a big success as THE atmospherically overwhelming and best written game up to this day (haven't played SOMA yet). Play Penumbra and - if you played later games of FG like Amnesia - you will experience an immersive adventure putting you through a relentless environment.Recommendation? I shouldn't, because it forces those combat sequences on you like crazy. But I have to considering the artistic part of the game, which takes a greater part than combat.If you really have doubts about the ever returning bad combat system, just read up on the plot and continue with the second game without playing this one. That's basically the workaround.			"

												This is one of the finest games of the survivial horror genere. I was first introduced to this game by a youtuber named Helloween4545. I fell in love with the game when I watched him play it and the love grew stronger when I experienced the evil demon dogs and nasty spiders for myself. This is a game that doesn't hold your hand, but in a good way. I give the game a soilid 8/10. It would get the prestigious 10 if it wasn't for the length and combat. In my opinion the game was a tad short, and the combat is terrible. *hint*, when foghting the dogs just stand on a box or barrel and hit them, you'll be too high to be hit.			"

												Captures the claustrophobic fear of being trapped and the madness that sets in during a gruesome struggle for survival. Fighting for your life feels clumsy and frantic at the same time: eventually I lost count of the number of zombie dogs I had wildly and desperately stabbed to death with a pickaxe. The sound design complements the atmosphere wonderfully and you will find your heart pounding in time with the ominous music before long.Puzzles are intelligent and interesting, sometimes requiring you to use your noodle to decipher codes from written clues or learn how to do something from a field manual rather than simply ""use item A on object B"".A little difficult and confusing at points but definitely worth a playthrough!

GODOGDODGODGODGODGODG JESUS CHRIST HOLY-- holy... jesus.""Then there was this time where I was running and way like ""GOD OH GOD!"" and screaming and stuff, then my friend decided to say in my ear in that creepy a** voice of his ""Run, run, as fast as you can! You can't escape me, I'm the gingerbread man!"" and I was like ""SHUT THE HELL UP!""This game... is... in my opinion... SCARIER THAN AMNESIA. Amnesia is more of the psycological horror, and there are those zombie things, but it's just... unsettling. Penumbra, is that, PLUS a freaky a** dog that is HALF MAULED, AND creepy notes everywhere that say things like ""I came down here with four of my colleges and learned a few things..."" then later it says ""...and humans are tasty."" And you know what is next to that note? A big stain of blood... alright?... And two pairs of BLOODY BOOTS! NOT COOL MAN! And when you read this note, guess what you're hiding from? THE FREAKING DEMONIC HALF-EATEN DOG!!So yeah. Creepy atmosphere, freaky scary creatures, and it ACTUALLY managed to scary me. ME!

Penumbra: Overture, as the title would suggest, is the opening chapter of the first-person horror epic Penumbra, from the creators of Amnesia and SOMA.Originally released in 2007, P:O was one of the early standouts in psychological horror, and laid the foundation for many of the concepts and mechanics that have come to characterize the genre, notably: a relatively weak, ""everyperson"" protagonist who has no choice but to rely on running, hiding, and sneaking to avoid and bypass effectively invincible hostile creatures; consumable light sources that force the player to balance ability to see against likelihood of being seen, as well as exploration against safety; use of auditory and visual effects to communicate the emotional state of the player character; strong emphasis on immersive audio design; environmental puzzles that require the player to brave dangerous or disturbing situations to collect the necessary components and/or clues to solve them; and the application of the Lovecraftian principle that a nebulous suggestion, filled in by the player's imagination and dangled at the edge of awareness, carries much more potential for terror than something explicitly portrayed in graphic detail.The story begins as the protagonist, Philip LaFresque, receives an unexpected letter from his presumed-dead father, urging him to destroy a set of cryptic documents. Upon investigating them instead, Philip applies his Library Use skill, discovers a reference to a mysterious location in Greenland, and, apparently armed with only a flashlight, a bottle of Jack Daniel's, and his wits, sets off to uncover the truth. In terms of gameplay, the player interacts very directly with the environment - doors and drawers are manually pulled open and pushed shut, levers manually raised and lowered, wheels manually rotated. In addition to H.P. Lovecraft, the game draws heavy inspiration from Half-Life - in terms of physical interactions, fans of board smashing, crate stacking, and barrel arranging will find plenty to like. There's even a crowbar engraved ""Freeman.""P:O is enjoyable and complete by itself, but its ending segues directly into Penumbra: Black Plague, and players who enjoy the overture should definitely continue. The game shows its age graphically, but the Penumbra series's strong writing and eldritch atmosphere make it a classic for fans of Lovecraft and stealth/survival horror.			"

												Penumbra: Overture is a solid survival horror from Frictional Games. Everyone knows frictional games from the massively successful and terrifying Amnesia: The dark desecent. While I have played some Amnesia I personally really enjoyed Penumbra. While the graphics are dated, and Amnesia is overall a better experience, Penumbra delivers scares and is a really good starting point for the studio. It's cheap and short, and it is 100& worth it, even if you are going back to it. It's a great game.			"

												One of the best horror games i've played, but it does has some flaws.On the bright side, the atmosphere is fantastic, the music and sound effects are really well made, it gives the game a constant feel of dread. I found myself scared to advance in several ocassions.Even though the game game has a interesting story, at the end it only raises more questions than answers ( but there is a sequel called Black Plague, i've played a couple of hours, so far so good).Also, the character named Red, is one of the best things in the game, and the voice acting was great.The physics based controls and gameplay are also one of the (and maybe the best) best things of the game.As i said, the game has some flaws.The game is rather short. Unless you get stuck somewhere, you can finish it in under 6 hours.The combat is a major flaw, and my biggest complain. It is poorly made and barely effective. The best resource against an enemy will be to run like hell. Also, once you figure out how to kill an enemy, most of the suspense and tension gets lost.Overall i recomend it, it's an interesting game, and even with it's flaws, is still very scary.7.5/10			"

												Penumbra is a horror game that resides in a special place in the genre of horror games, as it not only tries to scare you but rather makes you horribly miserable and lonely the more you progress. The atmosphere is really well done and while playing I felt more and more isolated, the deeper I went into the mine. If you pay attention to the details and let yourself into the mood, this game will reward you by kicking you in the balls and laughing at you while you whimper on the ground. So much for the mood part.The puzzle mechanics are a bit rough and unpolished, which is excusable as this is (one of?) the first games of this studio and you see quite some elements that are later refined in titles like Amnesia. The combat system (which they thankfully removed in the second part) is pretty wonky and needs a lot of getting used to, the best option is to hide.If you can forgive the mediocre mechanics and really need to feel down, this is the title for you.

												So you get this feeling, not a haha feeling but a calling feeling (I'm sure we've all expirenced it before..... Maybe..... Probably not). Anyway, you have this inexplicable feeling to journey to Greenland and find your father.... or something. And what you find is completly expected (Snow). But wait, its not just snow, there is also ICE! After a blizzard that nearly freezes you colder then a cave man you find a door. Its not just any old door though, this door is heated (how else could you open it). Now, you are in a stange hallway with a flickering light! How scary! Then there is some blood, then there is a worm, then there is an incinerator, and then the end. But hey, it was kinda fun.			"

												I'm not into horror games that much, but damnit this game is so good. Really interesting story, cool puzzles, pretty spooky. Combat sucks though, good thing the sequel got rid of that. Amnesia is a spiritual successor to this series and I honestly think that game is the best horror game I've played, but the Penumbra series is still pretty damn good. Get this and Black Plague (skip on Requiem if you're not into puzzles and no horror) and play them.			"

												With poor visual appeal, the whole game just screams ""LOW PRODUCTION VALUES"" when compared to contemporary titles.However, far from it for Penumbra to succumb to low-production values on every front, the voice acting of the characters is phenomenal. Coupled with the game's inherently interesting plot (for those who simply can't walk away from a narrative like this) Penumbra boasts a wonderfully well-written and well-made storyline.It brings complex puzzle-solving gameplay with a pall of eeriness cast upon the game that leaves you wanting to take a few steps back every time you make one step forward.In addition to this, right from the beginning, for those interested at all in analytics, the game harps, rather subtly, on human nature. Howard, Philip, Red, all well-animated characters (figuratively speaking... of course) provide the game with a less-than-subtle hint of humanity.All in all one of the most well intriguing and captivating games I've played in quite some time.

												Maybe it's because I've been so spoiled playing Amnesia Dark Descent and Outlast... but this game only spooked me a little bit. The puzzles and figuring out things was fun... but the creatures among the puzzles were just annoying after a while. A couple things did take me by surprise, but over all... I was kind of disappointed.Story line? ""oh where is everyone? oh what happened to my dad? oh what are these weird lanterns? oh how do i get out""I finished this game in under 6 hours.Bug report: early on in the game I had my grab/interact mouse disappear on me. Had to restart.Controlling was very easy for the most part. Keyboard and mouse. The ONE thing that bothered me the most was having to shake my mouse like an idiot just to swing a hammer or a pick-axe. -.-Motionsickness? Yes, unfortunately. I think the repetative tight corridors and looking around for clues is what did me in.Would I recommend this? Well... maybe. I don't know. Personally, if you want a game not as scary as Amnesia DD, then sure... but if you are really looking for loads of OH GOD MY HEART! then... I'd actually say skip it. o_o Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad. it just wasn't great.I think maybe I will recommend if you're kind of looking for a horror game to quickly pass the time OR if you scare really easily. Just maybe get it on sale.Here is hoping Penumbra Black Plague will be scarier.			"

												This is one of the finest games of the survivial horror genere. I was first introduced to this game by a youtuber named Helloween4545. I fell in love with the game when I watched him play it and the love grew stronger when I experienced the evil demon dogs and nasty spiders for myself. This is a game that doesn't hold your hand, but in a good way. I give the game a soilid 8/10. It would get the prestigious 10 if it wasn't for the length and combat. In my opinion the game was a tad short, and the combat is terrible. *hint*, when foghting the dogs just stand on a box or barrel and hit them, you'll be too high to be hit.			"

												This is going to be a hard review. I wish I could be neutral about it, but due to Steams review mechanics I will have to reach a verdict at the end. Oh boy. Please read carefully, especially my conclusion!Lets talk about the atmospheric, story-driven experience you are going to get out of this first. Though graphically not top-notch given the year the game was released it sets up a great, intimidating and believable atmosphere with a mysterious touch to it. Great sound assest, brilliant light effects and decent level design regarding maze-like interiors. Aesthetically everything falls into place when you consider the fact that you are an explorer going down into a mine to find secrets your father left behind. The story, while a little bit predictable, is told very well and involves the player in it.Mechanics. It is Frictional Games' first game which set a milestone in story telling gaming, which is wonderful. Not so wonderful is the fighting system, which is forced upon you when encountering enemies, like dogs or spiders. It is not like in Games like Half-Life where you bash your enemies' heads in with your crowbar while still being able to evade their attacks - no! You have to swing your melee weapons with your mouse and you control it directionally, meaning that you can swing either side: left, right, or direct push. Problem is, that your screen locks when you try to swing, so you are unable to move. This is obviously not a good idea and you might think, that it encourages sneaking. And yes, at first that is the case - but soon you are not able to avoid encounters and you will have to brawl your way through, which is frustrating in a great way. This is a big negative, since it is practically forced upon the player and you have almost no way of avoiding it or finding a way around fighting - and you will come across those situations regularly.Other mechanics work quite well. Puzzle solving is a bit tricky at times given the dated graphics, especially texture quality. For example: You find a key and don't know where to put it? It might be that pixely black mess of a texture on a control panel! This makes it quite complicated and it could use some sort of indicator, but well, it works somehow. Certainly, patience is required.ConclusionIF, only if you can withstand a large amount of depressing forced and flawed combat (I guarantee you that you will shut your game off multiple times!) and live for excellent atmosphere in every aspect, I can recommend this game. This game shows you why Amnesia was/is such a big success as THE atmospherically overwhelming and best written game up to this day (haven't played SOMA yet). Play Penumbra and - if you played later games of FG like Amnesia - you will experience an immersive adventure putting you through a relentless environment.Recommendation? I shouldn't, because it forces those combat sequences on you like crazy. But I have to considering the artistic part of the game, which takes a greater part than combat.If you really have doubts about the ever returning bad combat system, just read up on the plot and continue with the second game without playing this one. That's basically the workaround.			"

												Before Amnesia, there was Penumbra, a series of games that put you in the  dark-cold caverns of a secret facility where many questionable things have occured. While not a blood and gore type of game, Overture makes the player feel very uncomfortable right from the start, throwing danger and death quickly into the player's path. While the controls are simple, some are quite difficult to master, such as utlizing a weapon to defend yourself. The number of enemies is limited to less than a handful, but despite this the game has you question your every movement, thanks to the help of a man-eating-giant-worm and the unstable areas of which you tracel. The atmosphere is good, the graphics okay, and the story is relatively puzzling. Unless you are too frightened, you will likely want to purchase the sequal.			"

												When playing a survival / horror game, atmosphere is definitely a key factor in immersing you in the game... which Penumbra Overture does just fine. Puzzles are simple tailoring the games' story line. The sounds are also simple yet enough to send chills down your spine. What makes takes this game back is the stupid AI of the dogs and the awkard handing of the weapon.Graphics ain't top notch but it's still worth a try to play the game.			"

												Wow!  Just beat this game and that's about all I can say is wow.  It was awesome!  I just glanced at the first couple of reviews and noticed they're negative reviews complaining about the combat style and I guess non-intuitiveness? of the control scheme, and I have to say, I do agree if you're playing it on a traditional monitor/screen.  But I just played the whole game on my Oculus CV1 thanks to the VR mod and it's truly amazing.  The genius modder, Joseph Delgado, definitely deserves props for this one!  Some notes on the VR mod:  It fully supports Oculus Touch (even though he wrote it for and with the HTC Vive in mind), however, it does require a 360 degree setup (3 sensors) because there is no turning mechanism (snap turning or otherwise).  But with 3 sensors in 360 setup, it's nothing short of fantastic.  The only issue is Philip doesn't jump as high or far in the VR mod since the modder did something kind of screwy with the gravity I believe.  I didn't actually play the game in 2D before I jumped into VR so I didn't know any better until I found 2 spots in the game where it was completely unpassable in the VR mod due to not being able to jump far enough.  Once I realized I just played those 2 parts on my desktop real quick and once it gave me a save point, I went back to VR and it only happened twice.So for the rest of my review on the game, I want to point out that these devs really knew how to make a great game.  It has everything from compelling story, crazy atmospheric gameplay, sounds, and the list goes on.  This is a gem of a game.  I'm kind of torn on whether I should play the next Penumbra game since there is no VR mod for it, or just wait for the source code to be released so another fine soul can add VR support.  Hell, even though this is an old game by now, it might prove a good idea for the original devs to add VR support for this series and gain some recognition and reputation for a future game/series hopefully built for VR as well.  Just food for though.  Anyway, 2 Thumbs Up!			"

												From the makers of Amnesia â The Dark Descent. There, now buy it. Oh okay, I guess Iâll say a little more. Iâm not going to ruin anything about the story, firstly because Iâm not a total jerk and secondly because I donât remember a whole lot about it. What I will say is the developer, Frictional Games, does a phenomenal job in creating a creepy atmosphere, hair-raising moments, and clever puzzles for you to solve all the while.


YouTubeâ¢ Video: GBFSHS - Penumbra - Overture (PC)Â 

			Views: 12		

			Today we get stranded in Greenland and learn about eating spiders and evading wolves. ***** Penumbra - Overture is copyright Frictional Games/Paradox Interactive, 2007.		

For $20, you get three Penumbra titles: Overture, Black Plague, and Requiem, which is apparently an expansion to Black Plagueâ¦so Iâm not entirely certain how thatâs supposed to work, but whatever. Iâve only played Overture (first in the series), but I was impressed enough with that, so I can definitely vouch for the others. If youâve been on the fence about Amnesia, definitely check these out so you can get an idea of what youâre in for.			"

												Well here i go with this one, so i came into this game thinking it was going to just be one of those typical horror games full of blood and jumpscares which well sure there was a few bits of blood but it wasn't overwhelming and a couple of jumpscares but they set the feeling before the jumpscare happens so its not like fnaf or something that only uses jumpscares as a method of scares. there was a few enemies or well monsters which were dogs, spiders, and giant worms and while the ai is pretty bad they still feel like a threat when you're playing. The story is actually great and even though there is a cliff hangar being this is part 1 i still felt bad for things i read and had to do and was compelled to find out what happened to the character's father which i think the story is mostly why i really liked this game. The controls were kinda funky but that is just the system they used (like amnesia, which no i haven't beaten it and i kind of want to finsh this series before i beat it). i give this game 8/10			"

												This is where genius was born. It's easy to see that the artists who perfected their art in SOMA and Amnesia started out on the right foot. Yes, it has rough edges and yes, some mechanics are outright terrible (the axe-swinging for example), but the atmosphere and the story more than make up for this. I'd also like to point out that I think this game has aged very nicely. It's still very much playable and looks good, apart from some animations and models, but well, different times, different technology... If they remade it today, it would look absolutely stunning.

												Very decent game, and with it equalling to about 3.33, I'd say pretty well worth it. I haven't played the other two yet, but this one was pretty good. I was satisfiied with the puzzles, and the controls were pretty decent for what they wanted to accomplish. Fighting was a nightmare, but that might've been intentional. Once you get used to killing things, it becomes relatively easy if you're not afraid of doing a part over again. All in all, interesting story, good gameplay, good puzzles, and I'd give it a 6/10.

												Overture has been a great adventure through cold perilous mineshafts full of puzzles. Frictional is good at hiding things in plain sight so stay keen as this game will test your wits at times. Looks and plays well, very enjoyable. Game itself is worth the moneys, I highly suggest getting the Collectors Pack.			"

												Cool adventure/semi-horror game. Not too scary, not too difficuly either. Except for some small parts where you really need to know exactly what to do by forehand in order not to die.Great atmosphere, both in gfx and sound.Environment is quite nice for its time (it's an old game already) and there's enough content to keep you busy for a decent amount of time.One negative thing though. The dog encounters were getting a bit annoying. Once you got past a few either by being stealthy or using some other tricks, these encounters kept dragging on a bit too long for my taste.Still, very enjoyable to play.For best experience: lower gamma a little. By default, the screen is still too bright, making the use of lightsources less mandatory than it should be in my opinion. "

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Penumbra: Overture is the first game in the Penumbra trilogy and developed by the gods of horror and their first ever game; Frictional Games and published by Paradox InteractiveI won't go on and on with this one, but let me just say that before Frictional Games' Amnesia: The Dark Descent became synonymous with fear, they were perfecting their craft with the Penumbra seriesThis game has it all. From the atmosphere that breathed down my neck, tingling my spine and darkening my thoughts to the gameplay immersing me into the world, this game hits all the right notesI won't spoil anything, but let me just say don't let the atypical setting of a mental asylum fool you. It's much more than that, and giving this game enough of your time to find out why is well worth the investmentI highly recommend this game and the Penumbra trilogy in general! RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Crap fighting controls.  Very difficult just to swing ang hit something.  Doesn't help with spiders crawling around.  Puzzels are good but some have a hint of keep trying even when you get them.  Example is climing a high up ladder.  You have to keep jumping in just the right spot to click.			"

												Absolute must-play for anyone interested in survival horror. Frictional's pre-Amnesia take on what would become the groundwork for first-person horror is, and especially for its time, an absolute masterclass. If you enjoyed either of the Amnesia titles or are a horror fan in general, play this. You'll get the bone-chilling tension you want out of a horror game with some incredible atmospherics to boot.
