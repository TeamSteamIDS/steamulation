												  As you can see, by my so far 1300 hours (6 man-months of work), I felt there was more to the game than what you could pick out in just a coupla hundred hours of play.  I found so many slight adjustments that occurred whilst I was playing, such as you came in the game in the dry season, as evidenced by the fires visible on the cab ride into town, plus the cab driver's admission that it WAS the dry season.  That meant that the flare gun and Molotov cocktails were at their peak efficiency for destruction, since when the wet season came about three hundred hours later, the grass turned green and your flame and smoke damage were quite a bit reduced.   Also if you timed the moon just right, you could pick a cloudy night for a most stealthy job and have a better chance of completetion.  I found out at 750 hours that after you ride shotgun on that weapons barge across the lake, and you warn the doctor, that you don't have to fight you way thru the town to make it out alive.  You could just hop up on the cart, climb the stall to the tarp above it, jump onto the roof of the clay building just behind the Dr.'s office and make your way to the swamp boats that were moored right there in the garbage cove.    I would pile cars up  in special preset locations and set C4 to explode as I approached the exits, and then had a Liberty Jeep waiting (those are the best armor rating, except for the 3 tonners, I have read others more informed than I say) to ride like a snowplow thru the enemy blasting away. Thank goodness for game saves, those made it possible for me to complete the game in many situations where I, in my mighty inflated ego, thought the only  way through was blasting away and running and dodging like a basketball player making way downcourt.   I do believe that playing the game on Master (Very Hard) is the only way to play, and you should be by the first five hours, unless you are a nubie, it gives the enemy some brains, and they go after you, not just wait to be shot.  Love the way they will ambush and surprize you, call you out.  That you can go back into the first area in FC2 after getting cooler weapons in the second area is a great idea.  Going back and blasting like no tomorrow is a nice way to past time.   Using subtrafuge, and disattraction, with drawing their attention to the other side of the camp and knifing the few left on duty station is a way of penetrating into some camps that you feel just have to be obliterated by grenade-launcher technicals until you realize there is another way, and another, and another ad nauseum.  There are just so many ways to accomplish each mission, with the one where if you kill everyone in the mine, except the bosses in the tin admin shack, they will ply you to let them live and you can  walk right into an office of the enemy with all of your weapons and just blast them to bits, which until then you thought that you needed to be searched and disarmed before entering the mucky-mucks hdqtrs.  The thumbs-up the dude at the door gives you when you arrive to fulfill the promise they gave at the mine is awesome, dude is like, no problem, bro.  If you drive a nade-jeep all the way up the narrow path to the safe house to contact your mercanary friend about the killing of the government minister of censory before having the dejay read the propaganda to kill the medical doctor in his rounds, you can step outside of the safe house right after the meeting and climb directly into the jeep without touching the ground, and blast away over the hillside into the resort area where he is residing with his finger on the cut-off switch in case anyone trys what you are gonna do.  I thought it was easy having a nade-boat fifty feet away in a cove ready to go a hundred feet to blast the resort, but being able to hop outside and complete her or his part of the mission within seconds is majical.  This is perhaps not so much a game as a sort of lifestyle alteration.  "

												The first time I felt bad killing someone in Far Cry 2, it was a death I didn’t see coming. I’d seen plenty of unpredictable, often hilarious things happen as a result of my violent actions -- I once shot a driver who then rolled his truck into a zebra, over a bridge, and into a river. Moments like this get more out of hand in Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 4.But when remembering my truly definitive Far Cry moments, and when asking myself which Far Cry game is best, I always think about Marty Alencar, the friend I murdered.Marty was my first and best Buddy in Far Cry 2’s Africa. He was the man I rescued from a fiery plane crash. The guy who always brought me back to life when I took too many bullets, put a gun in my hand, and stood by my side until everyone around me died.Far Cry 4’s Guns for Hire system operates on a similar idea to Far Cry 2’s Buddy System, allowing you to summon an ally instantly to fight alongside you. But they’re nameless henchmen, expendable fodder I used to deliberately detonate landmines and send to certain death for the sake of distraction. I never cared about any of them. I used them.Compare this to Far Cry 2, where I relied on Marty, approaching him every time I stepped out the door, knowing he’d tell me he had my back, knowing it was true. Marty was a good man, always ready with another option when a mission wasn’t going to benefit me as much as it could. Yes, these “character traits” fed into the gameplay structure and story missions of Far Cry 2, but it convinced me that Marty Alencar was more than a Buddy -- he was a friend.Marty dragged me out of the line of fire and into the bushes when a random group of guys jumped me on the road. Stupid. You never take the road. A gunner on the back of a truck mowed me down while I fell into my own misplaced Molotov flames. Marty hands me a pistol and opens fire. I find a couple grenades, knock the truck around, and finish the job. When it’s all done, I hear Marty screaming for help. I can’t see him.By the time I find his blue smoke streaming out of the woods, he’s grunting incoherently. I kneel down, jab a regenerative needle into his stomach, and wait for him to head home. He doesn’t get up. He’s still wounded, so I put another needle in him. Nothing, but he slows down, and his eyes roll upward. One more needle. Marty’s head hits the ground, and he stops squirming.I overdosed my best friend.The wieght and impact moments like this have is why Far cry 2 is the real gem of the series and how Far Cry was meant to be. The pure unscripted brilliance. "

												I'm going to begin this review with a confession: Far Cry 2 is my favorite game in the Far Cry series.Since that one was so well received, let me go for a second confession: Far Cry 2 is probably the least popular game in the Far Cry series.It is my favorite game in the series because of the overall ""attitude"" of the game. It is everything Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is not. It is the very antithesis of Blood Dragon: Where Blood Dragon revels in being irreverent, ridiculous, and detached from reality, Far Cry 2 is gritty, realistic, and dark. It is a modern retelling of The Heart of Darkness, in which you play a mercenary hunting an arms dealer in a fictional African country, all the while battling malaria.It is not the most open world. You are not a bullet sponge. Health does not regenerate, and in fact guns will jam on you based on how dirty they are. There isn't even a skill tree or a quick melee button (you have to manually switch to your machete). However, it is probably the single most immersive gave I've played in a long time if not ever, and a fantastic story takes you through a unique setting not often seen (or done well) in games.Gameplay: Far Cry 2 is dated. It's not unplayable, but if you've recently played some of the other Far Cry games then the absence of some features is certainly conspicuous. However, the guns have punch, the player is fragile, fire is dangerous (it's a dry African setting), and the game reeks of realism. Yes, reeks. The main reasons people hated this game were because your character has malaria and because guns jam. Guns jamming is avoidable but you do have to address the malaria from time to time. It plays like a survival game, because you have to struggle to win (without it being too punishing). There's no skill tree and you have to really work for your equipment upgrades. While this isn't for everyone, if you go in expecting this kind of gameplay, you're going to enjoy the game more than someone going in blind. 8/10Graphics/Visual Experience: While the game is old, the graphics aren't too bad. I go back and play this every once in a while and I'm blown away by some of the nature scenes. The game is truly impressive when compared to other games released at the time and that gives it some true staying power. The environment is immersive (the first game I ever actually got lost in: The first day I played it, I played it for 12 hours straight) and while it's not in the same way characters in Skyrim have complete lives, it's still capable of sucking you in if you let it. The score that follows accounts for both the game being dated but still capable of impressing me: 7.75/10Sound: The song from the title screen is still on my phone somewhere. Guns don't always have a bassy sound but always feel like they have some punch. Ambient/background noise is done well, gives the environment some life without having wild animals like 3 and 4 do. 7.5/10Replayability: Not as much as the later games in the series. The main draw of 2 is the immersion and story. While the environment can suck you in, it's not particularly fun to explore because you don't get the feeling of missing out on interesting things as you drive from place to place. If you're like me you'll want to play and play until you finish the story, but there is a hard ending and that also kills post-story replayability. 5.5/10How it Runs: It's still a demanding game. I've played games released in late 2015 that made my computer run hot less often than this game. However, there are very rarely spikes in the resources the game needs to play smoothly. Physics aren't too intense, the worst the lag will probably get is when there's a bunch of fire on the screen. This is the first game with fire propagation, which they certainly wanted to show off. They actually had to set a limit because during testing, there were times when the entire in-game world was set on fire without the limit in place.			"

												This game is not related to the original FarCry in anyway except for name, if you go into FC2 expecting the same story/mechanics/locations/characters as the original you will be disappointed.That said this game really shines (or did shine back at release and the years after that) in the sheer vastness of it's open world ""sandbox"" enviroment.Almost 1.5k hours on record (I owned the disc copy years before it came to steam) and I have still not yet found every golden AK47; let alone explored every location in the southern ""second part"" of the game.Best part of this game is the weapon degradation (why don't more games have this!??!) that will affect all guns over time and add to the immersion.While the MP is not entirly alive all these years later I still do host a weekly get together for myself and a few pals where we mess around with custom maps/mods.Out of all the FC games I would have to score this one as 7/10 only because I have not yet finished it!

												Off-roading in Jeeps. Unlimited gunplay. Setting fires that spread with the wind. Hunting down your target with a machete. Firing a mortar into a pack of zebras. There's a reason this game still garners respect and admiration, and retains a cult-following to this day. It's an, ""off the beaten path,"" strategy-laced masterpiece. The gunplay is raw and satisfying. The environments are beautiful. The map is massive.The main complaint thrown at this game is respawning guard posts. The reason so many people hated this mechanic is because they played Far Cry 2 like a Call of Duty title. This game is not about just pressing the X button occasionally in between set-piece action sequences. This game forces you to slow your roll, take out your map, and plan a route to your target. It simply wants you to take your time with it. This is part of the beauty of the game.Each and every situation in Far Cry 2 has unlimited potential. Almost everything happens dynamically. You may have heard the term, ""emergent gameplay,"" being tossed around in the gaming press as of late. Well, Far Cry 2 was ahead of it's time for attempting to show the mainstream what ""emergent gameplay"" actually is, and in my opinion, the mainstream wasn't quite ready for it when this game released back in 2008. If you end up playing Far Cry 2, make sure you play it on either ""Hardcore"" or ""Infamous"" difficulty. It turns the A.I. into what you'd think gangs of vicious mercenaries and cold-blooded killers should be.Just effin' buy it.			"

												Far Cry 2 is one of the most immersive games I've played. It's a game I've always considered vastly underrated. I would go as far as to say Far Cry 2 is one of my favorite sandbox games period.Unlike most games Far Cry 2 tries to remain topical and relevant to current day events. The game takes place in an unnamed African country. The government has fallen and guns are worth more than human life. You play as one of several would be assassins sent to kill the Jackal, a notorious arms dealer.What Far Cry 2 does probably the best out of most sandbox games is it makes you feel like you live in Africa. The game's hud is minimalistic, your health pickups are syrettes of morphene. You're infected with malaria and regularly come down with a fever requiring constant supplies of medicine to avoid dying from. Your guns visually decay and eventually break apart in your hands. The world beautiful, but is always extremely hostile to the player. With long stretches of open land requiring almost constant access to vehicles and guard checkpoints at every corner forcing the player to massacre their way through. I never feel like I'm ever safe or that I'm ever comfortable when playing this game, and it's something that always fascinates me when I play it. I always feel like I'm perpetually on the brink of death in every firefight and I need to just keep pressing on, keep moving forward, and keep my finger on the trigger. There are hundreds of games that look like you're in a warzone, Far Cry 2 makes you feel like you're in one.			"

												Date of review: 10.24.2014Platform: PC Released in 2008, Far Cry 2 took a sharp turn from the first Far Cry, and threw the player into a much more realistic, grim, fictional African country. Forget the super mutants and crazy scientists, and get prepared for arguably the most authentic game representation of an African civil war.Story:In Far Cry 2 you can choose to be one of 9 pre-created characters, and while the choice itself will not have any real impact on the outcome of the story, the characters have interesting backgrounds and the ability to choose definitely improves the immersion.However, no matter who you choose, you will be a mercenary, sent to assassinate the Jackal, a notorious arms dealer who is arming both warring African factions, the UFLL and the APR… (the remaining characters will also show up in the game, as “buddies”, and they will help you throughout your progress). Of course things will go wrong, very wrong, and you will find yourself in the middle of a bloody war, AND sick with malaria. The story is exciting, and unique. Forget the good guy(s) who fight(s) the honorable war against the evil enemy kind of stuff... In Far Cry 2 everyone is a corrupt, backstabbing son of a b****,  and as you progress through the main plot you will realize that there is no good or bad choice, there is only bad and bad, and there is nothing you can do about it. Definitely not your average approach, but you know you are dealing with something unique when you get a Nietzsche quote right at the beginning of the game…10/10 Visuals:Far Cry 2 could obviously not  keep up with today's AAA games in terms of graphics, but maxed out it still looks very good. The African wilderness is very well depicted and diverse, with deserts, vast savannas, and jungles, and lively with several forms of wildlife running all around the place. The towns are filthy and dilapidated, with signs of poverty and war visible everywhere. On top of that, Far Cry 2 also has a live day-night cycle which is not only visually pleasing, but also adds a lot to the immersion.While I was more than satisfied with the visuals of the Dunia Engine, I did have some problems when enabling DirectX 10, which was causing seemingly random crashes on Windows 7 64 Bit Ultimate. On Windows 8.1 64 Bit Pro the problem disappeared…All in all, nice visuals, with some technical hiccups here and there. Today's computers should run it without any problems even on maximum details (for reference, you can check test system specifications at the bottom of the review).8/10Gameplay:Far Cry 2 follows the path created by the first Far Cry in terms of gameplay, but it also polishes and adds a number of new features to it. The world is truly open and huge (50 square kilometers) and provides a ton of things to do. You get a decently long main story with varied and interesting missions, and plenty of side quest from weapon dealers (who will reward you with new weapons), from buddies (who will reward you with safe house upgrades) and from the locals (who will reward you with malaria medicine). And on top of that, you have a lot of miscellaneous “quests” as well, like diamond searching and outpost scouting.You can probably rush through the game in 15 hours or so, but you can easily spend 50+ hours and still have things to do.But this is an FPS, so what about the weapons? No need to worry, the weapons are also varied (from pistols and sub machine guns to assault rifles, sniper rifles, light machine guns and even exotics such as the flame thrower and the mortar) and provide several ways of combat. It’s up to you to decide whether you will try to dispatch your foes from far or in a bloody close combat. Stealth however didn’t really work for me, and as far as I can tell, the developers didn’t want to make it a really viable option… something I can understand in a way, this is a civil war after all. Still, it’s fun to shoot, the weapons are quite realistic (don’t expect an ArmA type of game though) and the flame thrower is really awesome, even if not very effective actually.Still, this wouldn’t be a Far Cry without vehicles, right? Right! You also have vehicles in Far Cry 2, from small cars and modified assault trucks to boats and gliders… and while they feel completely arcadish, trust me, you will be thankful for them as the distances can be really huge.Unfortunately however, Far Cry 2 has its problems as well. Some of the side missions become repetitive after a while, the weapons have a degradation system which is interesting, but way too fast, the AI is simply painfully stupid sometimes (although when it works, it will surprise you…) and… well you have the “outpost system” which is one of the most frustrating features I have ever seen in a game. There are dozens of outposts scattered throughout the map, manned by the soldiers of the warring factions who will shoot you on sight. While the concept does make sense, and clearing the outposts is fun at first, they will soon become frustrating because of their insane re-spawn rate… it’s really not fun to clear out an outpost, walk away a couple hundred meters and come back to find it fully manned again. Ubisoft, this was really stupid!8.5/10Sound:In terms of music and sound effects Far Cry 2 is above average. While the soundtrack isn’t really memorable, the African tribal theme is pleasant and adds to the immersion, and the environmental and combat sounds are actually quite good. Unfortunately the dialogs are a bit soulless which sometimes kills the characters.8/10Replay value:While the plot is linear and there aren't any choices which would significantly change the outcome (which was done on purpose as far as I can tell, because in the end Far Cry 2 is story oriented and has a very strong message to communicate), the game provides countless possibilities, and can easily suck you in, making the game worth returning to.9/10Conclusion:Far Cry 2 is a very good game, with a unique setting, a unique plot, and a strong message which raises some very interesting moral questions. And while it might be a bit outdated by today’s standards, it’s definitely one of those games which you have to play at least once.I really recommend it if you are willing to invest some time into it, and if you are interested in something different, something special. If you are looking for a simple “tunnel shooter” however, you might get somewhat disappointed.8.5/10Test system specifications: AMD FX-8350 (OC @ 4.6 GHz); 8 GB DDR3 RAM @ 1866 MHz; AMD Radeon R9 280X (AMD Catalyst 14.4), Windows 7 64 Bit Ultimate / Windows 8.1 64 Bit Pro.

												threw one molotov next thing I know Africa is on fire.10/10 (old review) {Please work with me as I go out of order in events because that's how it's going through my mind as I write this.}Where to begin with such a great game? You could start anywhere really, the setting is in Africa, you enter the country (I forget if they say. [yes I know Africa is a continent]) hunting a man known as ''The Jackal'' an arms dealer and your mission is to eliminate him; to stop the gun trafficking in the war torn country, but things turn down south immediatly after your boots touch the ground you've gotten malaria (This... This was one of the annoying/funny things I found that happen in the game, I mean c'mon it's freaking Malaria no one really wants to black out in the middle of a gun fight, I mean when I did I kept screaming ''♥♥♥♥! ♥♥♥♥! ♥♥♥♥! Not now! Surely I have one more pill to keep me going!'' But alas I didn't and woke up a day later in a church now angry about the travel time I have to ensue yet again.) I digress through the events of the game you find new friends, new enemies, and many plot twist with these characters, and the currency in this game is Blood Diamonds which you find all across the map and from completing missions. If you read my little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review from the beginning you'd understand what I mean, it's pretty ridiculous, what starts as a little fire now consumes your entire screen. Now then the combat in this game I thought was pretty well for this game because there was a lot of realism for the time for example your gun would jam and you'd have to unjam it in the middle of a firefight (now you could avoid this altogether by getting a new version of the gun from your gun stash) or you'd find enemies weapons that are so rusty that litterally sometimes after 5-6 shots after you picking it up it just keeps jamming up and you scream ''WTF'' (you will do this trust me). Let me think ah yes! The RPG's in the game quite fun instruments, but just as dangerous! You could shoot a dud and then be like me and run away screaming or sit there like an idiot... Your call... the other thing it would do is start you on fire and you can easily put it out by using the healing animation. Now then moving on to Multiplayer... Just wow the creativity of people's imagination just blew me away! People were creating maps such as D-day with such realism you could look into a history book and it look the same, I always loved those kind of people when it comes to games where you can create such things, I certainly wish I could have that kind ability or at least a little bit of it haha. Onwards we go though, the multiplayer back then was pretty fun people were nice and they also very team play coordinated (which I love in team based games instead of lone wolves {which can work depending on the game and game modes} and I don't know how it is now since I haven't played multiplayer again yet due to playing with friends with other games. Finally my score of the game: 10/10 still. I enjoyed litterally every part of the game, the characters, the story, the twists, and also being able to find some crazy ♥♥♥♥ that goes on in here.			"

												Far Cry 2 is game that I would call a ""victim of the bandwagon"". It was generally hated by the community upon release because it had nothing to do with the first game. (Which frankly isn't a bad thing.) Rather, FC2 tried to take the series in a new direction. No mutants or cliche action seqences. Just gritty violent dark chaos   unfolding in the African jungles around you. The stripped down approach is quite appealing because the game seems to take itself more seriously. Putting more emphasis on tactics than just going in guns blazing. Story: You play as a hired gun that was sent by an unknown party to kill an infamous arms dealer named the Jackal. According to information provided, he is largely responsible for increasing instability inside Africa by stirring up civil wars in the country by providing weapons to both sides. Sounds easy, right? Go to Africa, find the Jackal, kill him. As you soon find out, it's not the simple. You soon start to play a part in the fate of the country and that perhaps, there's bigger problems than a person selling guns. It's an interesting story if you're willing to invest into it. The Jackal is an interesting character to listen to as he describes his life in the country. How the increased violence and warfare is slowly tearing the country apart. Gameplay: FC2 is a sandbox shooter at it's core. You're dropped into a beautiful lush world with various objectives to complete at your leisure. How you approach the goals is also up to you. Go guns blazing, go stealth, snipe, etc. As long as you got the tools, you got a plan. It's very satisfying to go in stealth and pick off guys from the darkness of the jungles. Watching them panic as their numbers get reduced one by one. Overall, I can't complain about FC2. It's a well made shooter that will keep gamers entertained for while. If you like planning attacks out and you're all about think first, shoot later. This game is up your alley.			"

												I've put in more than 40 hours into this game on the Xbox 360 version, as well as the non-Steam version, so don't mind the lowly 9 hours I've put into the game here on Steam.This is a fantastic game, and I personally prefer it over Far Cry 3. I was a huge fan of the original Far Cry (no, not the one on Xbox called Instincts, but the very first one on PC!). It was a flawed but fun game, with glitchy AI but beautiful levels and an open world design, where you could do a mission multiple different ways. I was worried when Far Cry 2 was announced to be in Africa and not a tropical island like the first, and that Jack Carver wouldn't be returning. I bought Far Cry 2 anyway when it released on PC, back when games didn't always come with Steam keys.I was immediately addicted. The game is very gritty, with just about everything out to kill you. It's definitely not for casual gamers. Weapons start rusting and breaking after long uses, eventually exploding in your hand, damaging you and forcing you to scavenge for a weapon off the ground while enemies are shooting at you from all directions. Cars can start to break down, requiring you to quickly get out, pop the hood, and use your magical wrench to fix it all while enemies are driving down the road trying to find you. Bones will break. Shrapnel will stab into your thigh. Bullets will require pulling out of your arm. You'll need to heal yourself, which uniquely has your character fix himself through multiple animations of ripping out large chunks of metal from his legs, bandaging himself, etc. It all looks fantastic and gives the game, as I said earlier, a very gritty feel.The game is flawed, just like Far Cry 1. The AI is iffy. It's hard to stealth. The story isn't delivered very well. Everyone talks like they've got to get to the last rocket off Earth. There's respawning guard outposts (though you can easily go around them, to be honest). But even with all of that said, I still think the game is much more unique and fun to play compared to Far Cry 3. I love exploring Africa, it looks gorgeous. If you ask me, I think the engine they used for FC2 (Dunia Engine) looks much better than the slightly cartoon-y style FC3 had with the Dunia Engine 2.I'd recommend the game if you're looking for a different, less casual type of FPS. It's got an incredible amount of detail, the weapons are fun to use, there's some very cool features like weapons breaking down, the healing system, and the way AI interact with each other (enemies will try to drag their friends away after they've been hurt, for example). It's a very underrated game, and I hope one day we'll get another Far Cry like this. One that isn't afraid to be different and try new things.EDIT: I recently started playing Far Cry 4 on my Playstation 4, and I just wanted to say that if you were a fan of Far Cry 2, but sad that FC3 removed a lot of the neat ideas 2 brought with it, you should definitely check out FC4. It feels like a mix of all the things I loved about FC3 and brought back a few things I missed that FC2 had, like fire realistically spreading (FC3 sorta had it still, but it didn't work well), being able to go to sleep to change to a specific time of day, and hell, even a certain character returns from FC2! I won't spoil who it is, but it took me by surprise, since he wasn't a particularly big character in FC2. He's also the first recurring character in a Far Cry game, other than one other character who returns from FC3. Seems like Ubisoft is starting to make the games connect a bit!			"

												Far Cry 2 - for me still the best part of the whole series. After playing through it multiple times (during internet downtime) i can safely say: This game is incredibly awesome!You start as an agent sent to an african country to hunt down an arms dealer. Too bad, you end up getting malaria and in need to rely on help of the local warlords. You help those guys out and get deeper and deeper into the fight between the different forces. The game, as allready mentioned, takes place in a fictional african country. You have 2 very huge areas in which are you free to move around and shoot people and animals. You have a lot of different weapons to use, some which you can find, others which you can buy. You get access to new weapons by completing side missions, same as malaria pills, which you need to survive. During your time you get to meet a few other mercenarys, some which get to be you friends and come help you in times of need. The Story is generic, but enjoyable, same with the missions. The graphics are beautifull, the african setting totally stunning. Yo can spend an incredible huge amount of time in the game, if you e.g. play on a high difficulty, simulating maximum realsim. The engine does its best to help with that! The sound you are listening to during your playtime might be a bit generic but is very nice to listen to. Multiple possible endings complete this wonderfull game.10/10 Still the best Far Cry game i've ever played, plus one of the best SP shooters. [Hint: i've heard mods make this even more enjoyable. I did not test that out though] "

												This game is absolutely great no matter what haters say. Haters are mostly people who've played Far Cry 3 first, which has its positives, and while it's more cinematic than Far Cry 2, you just play to get over with it after a while. The Cons:Far Cry 2 only has 2 actual cons and they're both closely related. First of all, driving everywhere is mandatory, unless you use a bus station, which basically fast travels you to another bus station. However, you can't fast travel anywhere at anytime. The second con is related like I said, and it's the fact that you have to drive all the way to another underground station to get more Malaria pills. Malaria itself is an interesting part in the game and it adds to the difficulty and surprise since you might be taking out a huge army of enemies and suddenly feel the Malaria kick in. However, having to drive to an underground station to get passports and then travelling to another Underground station to give the passports and get the pills, is a huge detour that could have been avoided.The Pros:This game's positives overwhelm the negatives by far. The physics engine is absolutely perfect and it's undeniably better than Far Cry 3 and 4's since almost everything is dynamic. That means you can use fire for your advantage, unlike 3 and 4 where fire just spread everywhere randomly around the source of the fire. In Far Cry 2 since the environment is dynamic, by looking at how the wind blows (grass and trees' leaves can indicate that since they are moving n/s/w/e) you can actually use fire to your advantage and trap enemies inside a fire circle that's getting closer to them by the second.Another notable pro is that Far Cry 2 has a great gameplay that makes sure you're never bored. Malaria, Weapon jamming, respawning camps (some people find them annoying but we could all see how dead the island was in Far cry 3 after all camps were captured), a great arsenal of weapons, and of course, much fun with the flamethrower. It's also worth noting that Far Cry 2 in Infamous mode is an extremely hard challenge for all players and it can generate Dark Souls level of rage, which means the game actually respects the player and doesn't just ask you to be a Rambo in Africa. Overall, this game is great and the atmosphere are well as the gameplay itself show its true quality. Also, no Uplay! 11/10.			"

												Far Cry 2 is rather an anomaly amongst AAA releases, and - in light of Ubisoft's more recent games - a world away from their typical modus operandi in the way it presents an uncompromising and utterly standout creative vision, ridden all the way to completion. It's not a perfect game - there are a number of features that are evidently only partially implemented and have little effect on gameplay (the buddy system, the reputation system, the malaria), and the story and characters are lacking to say the least. But, what it lacks in narrative it makes up for in atmosphere and pure creative integrity. I've never played a game that so accurately recreates the FEEL of a real-world location as Far Cry 2 does Africa. Whether the sun is rising over the still river water in the morning, or setting over a fire in the dry grasslands, this game is DRENCHED in atmosphere. You can almost smell the dirt and feel the sweat dripping off you as you play. Aside from creating a living, breathing world (which, in my opinion, is one of the most important features that open-world games often fail to include), it shows that there was someone with vision that pushed the creative team to create a product that was not necessarily going to hold the hands of the player (unlike Far Cry 3 with it's HUD crammed full of indicators telling you what to do and when). For Ubisoft to make such a choice and release a game which may not have been accessible to every single walking, talking wallet is, in light of their recent history, utterly mind-boggling, and I applaud the team behind this game for their efforts. Everything else aside though, the game is genuinely well-made - the core features all work wonderfully, with solid gunplay, responsive driving, and a well-designed sandbox that rewards exploration with many distinct and beautiful locales. The enemies are aggressive and unforgiving, typically forcing you to plan your attacks and prepare the right weapons for the job - it's so rewarding when a plan comes together. Equally rewarding, however, are those moments when you're caught unprepared - perhaps you only have a sniper rifle, a pistol, and some molotovs, and are caught from behind by a number of enemies, so you start frantically flinging molotovs in the direction of the enemy who are somewhere out there in the bush, as you relocate. You find a new spot and look back to see the bush ablaze and enemies fleeing, some already dead in the fire. These moments of pure, unscripted tension and excitement are what makes this game far deeper than it would seem on the surface, and this is perhaps why this review is littered with anecdotes. Because this is a game that creates anecdotes organically. Of course, with Far Cry 3 they made a number of changes that made it more accessible, but less memorable in my opinion - in favour of a realistic setting they crafted a cartoonish tropical island, in favour of a do-it-yourself mission style they filled the HUD with feedback and mission markers, in favour of challenging fights and impressive AI they put enemies in brightly coloured shirts who bum-rush you the second you fire a bullet, and on top of that they littered the world with meaningless fetch-quest items. It's not to say that I think FC3 is a bad game, but I find myself getting bored quickly every time I play it. Far Cry 2, however, is a game in which the fun one has is limited only by the player's imagination and creativity. The thing is, in its quest for realism, and its lack of strong narrative, I find the game actually offers the player a freedom that few other games genuinely do. The side missions are typically pretty bland, yes, but the strength of the world design and the freedom that you're offered means that there are quite literally countless ways to finish them. So you need to assasinate a target? Perhaps you block the road with your car and lie in wait to ambush him. Perhaps you wait until night and sneak in with a silenced pistol. Perhaps you snipe him from a nearby hillside. Perhaps you trap him in grassland and set the countryside ablaze. Perhaps you stride in with an RPG and just blow him the hell up. Even the way you choose to get to the location is undecided - do you drive the quickest route? Do you take the long way off road to avoid the checkpoints? Do you hop in a riverboat and take a shortcut downstream? You're given a target on a map, and complete freedom to traverse a believable world from then on. And even though I will criticise the lack of characters and story, the characters that are there feel like real, shady people. The main antagonist (although he is no Vaas) is enigmatic, and his cynical and exhausted outlook on the world becomes genuinely affecting as the game progresses, and I find that the thread of narrative that exists actually leaves you thinking about the real world situations that exist right now in so many African nations.It's clear that have a deep affection for this game, and that may be taken as bias by some, but it's an affection that was hard-won from release day as I slowly got used to Ubisoft's take on the franchise, unravelled the features of the game, and then began exercising my complete freedom to explore and manipulate the vast and beautiful landscape. This is a testament to what a strong creative vision can do to a AAA release, and while it might not go down in history as a particularly successful iteration, I feel that Far Cry 2 is one of the most criminally underrated games ever released and I defy any player not to be caught staring in awe as the sun rays filter through the canopy overhead. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a dirty, gritty, realistic shooter in an incredibly immersive world that lays the tools on the table, and lets the player decide what to do with them.

												A Good game on many accounts.Farcry 2 is unique, fun, exciting and definately challenging. The enviroment is dynamic and beautiful, albiet sometimes locked in and small. The tactic of creating bush fires to devastate enemies has become a godsend for me.Malaria is a topic all on it's own. Deadly, realistic and game-changing at times, it hosts a brand new, rarely implemented idea that is interesting as it is deadly.Unfortunately, this concept is also extremely annoying and frustratingly good at stopping progress. You have to constantly backtrack to get new pills and it tends to pop up during important moments in conflict, costing you a lengthy retreat or a undeserved death.Another issue i found was that the game feels.... crowded. You cant drive 500 yards without hitting another guard post (there are 63 in the map!) or enemy patrol. And once spotted, prepare to be tirelessly chased down and shot at until you are, injured and with a smoking engine, forced to pull over and face the threat. You can scout these posts and keep them from respawning soldiers, but it's a lengthy, time consuming process that takes away from the air of flowing gameplay and beauty otherwise found in Farcry 2.When it comes to guns, theres a LOT. So much different weapons and tools to use, so little time. From flare guns to rocket launchers, you will never have to worry about getting bored. The weapon unlocking system is fun but a bit tedious, and it seems to be a magnet for the ever-so-present danger of malaria. The story is less implemented and less of a focus, allowing you to create your very own path to find your conclusion. This may seem to make the game ""offset"" at times but it also makes Farcry seperate from other ""Go here, do This."" games like Battlefield, Call of Duty and Halo. Vehicles are fun, relatively diverse, and suprisingly fragile. It only takes a few wild bullets from a machine gun to turn your beautiful safari ride into a smoking husk of a truck. Return fire is not an option unless you stop the vehicle. Gliders are fun and a great way to get from place to place. Be careful when getting off them though!Map creator is absolutely astounding! Fluid controls and a large array of options can make anyone into a professional map creator. I've spent a good long time building maps and playing on others. It is quite possible to never play the same map twice in mulitplayer.All in all, this game has it's pitfalls, but the pro's outway the con's. This game is interesting, breathtaking and unique. I love playing Farcry 2 and im sure you will two.			"

												Farcry 2 is a fun game where you are in some African-style country off to raise hell. The gameplay is fun and nice for short and long lengths of playtime. The weapons are fun and the flamethrower can leave one hell of plains fire, so be careful with that thing! Farcry 2 is the last of the Farcry games that DID NOT incorporate Ubisoft's most terrible invention ever: Uplay. Yes, you can play this game without Uplay, and that instantly makes this better then Farcry 3 or 4. I recommend it.			"

Some people have called it a central African truck driving simulator rather than a first person shooter, and it all depends on how you look at the gameplay mechanics. It has a lot going for it with the open world, letting you tackle the missions as you prefer. The graphics and the African setting looks great. The game has a lot of features that really immerse you in the game, as the lack of minimap, instead utilizing a map you actually have to equip as an item and look at.The game puts you in a central African nation, where different factions are waging war at each other, and your mission is to stop the arms dealer supplying both sides. You have ""buddies"" helping you with missions (giving you optional ways to tackle the main missions) as well as giving you side missions of their own. They will also help you out of trouble if you get shot down.It's up to you to choose how to tackle each mission: get to the mission in an open world, utilizing buses for instant fast travel to a few set locations, otherwise the other vehicles available or going on foot, then finishing the mission objective in the way that best suits your playing style. Stealth, guns blazing, a tactical approach with grenades/molotovs to smoke the enemies out, or any other way? Your choice. Getting to the point of interest for each mission can take 1-4 minutes per mission, and sometimes involve shootouts as you get discovered by enemy patrols or checkpoints.The story sets out ambitious but doesn't hold together all that well. Most of the game is standard missions that are somewhat similar. One odd thing is that the DVD release of the game required the developers to speed up all recorded dialogue to make it take up less space. This is also in the steam version of the game. The fast talking NPC:s sound really odd!There are four things I got tired of while playing the game:1) Guards at guard posts always shoot at you, if you clear them out while passing they respawn until next time you pass.2) Enemies locate you way to easy, and fire at you with expert aiming, even almost dead enemies seem to have no problem hitting you with handguns at 300m range.3) Some enemies (this gets more frequent later in the game) can take almost a whole clip of ammunition before going down.4) If you do the buddy quests for the main missions, it can get quite tiresome to get to 3-4 different locations (some times at different sides of the map) to prepare everything needed for completing the main mission in an alternate way.I found out the perfect solution for problems 1-3: Dylan's Far Cry 2 Realism Mod 1.4. It fixes the stealth, the enemy health and the checkpoints (you can pass checkpoints without being fired upon most of the time). The game also gets a lot harder since your health is reduced as well (remember to save a lot), but much more satisfying. You're best off planning your assault, and it's really satisfying approaching an objective, taking out a few guards from afar with a sniper rifle, staying hidden to not draw enemy fire, then moving in closer and finishing the last guards off at close range with a silenced sub machine gun. You also come to appreciate strategic advantages as an elevated position. One of my best experiences with the game was behind cover with an assault rifle at an elevated position, moving from cover to cover, mowing down the enemies below. All the time the action being really tense since you know that getting hit by one or two bullets can end it all, so all firefights are really tense. At moments like these the game is glorious.I would really recommend the realism mod, and the game requires a bit of patience. For the right player, driving to each mission, sometimes avoiding (or taking out) enemy patrols along the way just builds up the tension, but will be tedious for other players, so you have to ask yourself if the way the game plays suits your taste.Except for running the realism mod, my recommendation would be to skip most of the buddy quests. It gets far to tedious to do them all, and the rewards aren't that great. The pacing is much better if you just stick to the main mission most of the time (ignoring the complaint calls you get from the buddy).Far Cry 2 is one of the best FPS games I've played, and also one of the most immersive games of all genres. It has a few drawbacks, mostly solved by the realism mod, and it requires the right player for the game, it isn't for everyone. If you want all action all the time, it isn't the game for you, but the realistic and short but immersive and tense firefights this game can offer are hard to beat if you're in to that kind of action.

												This game is my favorite single-player first-person shooter of all time. I enjoyed Doom back in the 90s, but other than that i am not really a fan of the genre. I find the mechanics somewhat repetitive - you are forced to kill everything, everywhere, spraying bullets around like you're in some kind of direct-to-video action flick. Even acclaimed shooters like Half-Life and Bioshock come across as cartoonish and tedious to me. Counter-Strike changed everything. A game where you only get a rifle and a sidearm, where every shot matters, where a bullet to the head means instant death and spending the next few minutes learning from people far more skilled than you. After playing Counter-Strike, every first-person shooter felt like a mindless kill-fest where stealth or tactics did not matter. The good news is those things do matter in Far Cry 2.You are still pretty much railroaded into killing everything that moves. It is an FPS, after all. But stealth always feels like a possibility. The tension before the killing ensues, the time you spend crouching motionless in elephant grass, is a highlight of the game.The enemies in Far Cry 2 are some of the most human i have encountered. It's why killing them takes a toll - they are a lot like you. If you have been seen - if any of your enemies spot you - the whole base goes on alert. Forever. They will lay down suppressive fire in your last known position. They will wall-bang. They will establish search parties. They will freak out and start getting paranoid over the slightest noise. If you are seen - or heard - again, expect to die. One or two shots from an enemy rifle will wipe you out. But stay perfectly still, crouched in the undergrowth, and the enemy may creep past just a few meters away. And, as they widen their net, you may be able to slip through and circle round. Inevitably, ♥♥♥♥ will go south. You are spotted and clipped, then running through the jungle, sliding to obscure their line of sight, spinning round to lob a grenade or to spray and pray. Mostly, you will die. It is ♥♥♥♥ing brutal.I know some reviewers have complained about the mechanics of this game. Respawning bases. Deteriorating weapons. Malaria. I will admit i played with Dylan's realism mod and never tried it any different, but in Dylan's mod it all makes sense. You are sick and scared and stumble into the jungle with a pea shooter. So you see an AK, grab it, but it jams in no seconds flat. You see an unguarded jeep, jump in, then get hit by an RPG half a click down the road. The game teaches you these hard lessons in the first half hour. How are you supposed to survive in Ubisoft's nightmare version of Africa? Don't pick up jury-rigged weapons. Don't jack jeeps. Wait till dusk, get your belly in the mud and proceed to your destination at a crawl. Avoid the roads, avoid the checkpoints, scout your targets and look for a headshot. Value reliability over firepower. Value cover over speed. Value your life.The story is grim. You play an opportunistic soldier of fortune in the midst of a civil war. Almost everyone is evil and corrupt, and the vast majority attack you on sight. Even if you try to minimize casualties on an assassination or sabotage mission, something will invariably ♥♥♥♥ up and the bodycount will rise. Or your next mission will require you to clean out a whole area anyway. Every time you hear a squeak you expect a technical to pull up and unload 50 cal into your back. Every time the sun falls on a certain pattern of leaves your trigger finger will twitch. And gosh, those hanging vines really do look like bodies sometimes, don't they? I loved Spec Ops: The Line for its simulated PTSD effects, but those were mostly scripted. Far Cry 2 plays it totally straight and your brain still goes there. ♥♥♥♥ is ♥♥♥♥ed up, man.So yeah. The game is punishing. It's bleak. You spend most of your time holding your breath and crouched in the dirt. Every now and then you are awed by a herd of zebra crossing the savannah at sunset, or the majesty of a tropical storm, or the slow rising moon. And then a bullet ricochets off a nearby cliff face and everything turns to ♥♥♥♥ again. A lot of games have made an impact on me due to their strong narratives. Far Cry 2 is different. The plot is thin as a potato chip, but its unforgiving sandbox houses an atmosphere thick enough to haunt me offline. Best single-player FPS since Doom? For me, yes. Hands down. "

												My Jeep had smoke coming out of the hood. It was driving slower than it usually did. I had just survived a brief skirmish with some trigger-happy hooligans, but with one quick grenade under their Jeep, the problem was solved. I saw a guard post up ahead.""Piece of cake."" they said. ""Clear it with that shotgun you just bought."" they said.I jumped off the Jeep and pulled out my shotgun. It really was a thing of beauty, a work of art: it was ornately decorated with what looked like silver on an African or Brazilian wood with a reddish hue. The sound of it being fired was pleasant but aggressive, kind of like gangsta rap or heavy metal. It was brand new, and I decided to affectionately name it Ho Lee Schitt, after my adoptive father from China.I sprinted over there. ""YIPPIE-KI-AYE-AY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S"" I screamed, in my best Bruce Willis voice. ""It's time to ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up!""But then, I realized the harsh reality of what was coming. I had limited ammo, and no grenades or molotovs. I had the rapt attention of about five heavily armed people who I had just threatened. The fastest means of escape I had was a small dune buggy on the other side of the shantytown. Malaria struck me almost instantly, and I heard the roar of a Jeep's engine. I felt a sharp pain overwhelming the entire left side of my body as I lost my grip on Ho Lee Schitt.""HO LEE SCHITT! NO!"" I screamed. and then I felt myself get smashed to the ground by a heavy steel chassis, and everything went black.But not for long! One of my buddies that I met earlier just came to pick my pathetic, lumpy body off the ground and save my life.""Ol' buddy, ol' pal!"" I was able to whisper to myself with all of my energy. Everything went black again, but only for about five seconds, and I saw my buddy, courageously fighting off my enemies with a rusty old pistol like the independent woman she was.But then I noticed her struggling. She left my body on the ground as she had to load her last magazine into the pistol. Odds were, one of us or both of us were going to die, and I was determined that if any of us were to die, it would not be her.So I bit the bullet and looked at my leg. It was surely broken, but there was a bullet hole in it, too. I couldn't just leave this bullet there, so I performed a brief, gory self-surgery with my trusty machete. She noticed that I was coming to, and decided to give me the gun.""Go!"" I yelled. ""Go into that house over there for safety. If one of us dies, it will not be you!""I saw as a bullet was fired into my left arm, which I noticed was also probably broken. I shoved my finger through the bullet hole and pushed the bullet out, leaving a clean hole in my arm. I collapsed to the ground, like some fat guy in dire need of doughnuts. I realized that I was going to die of malaria-induced lead overdose if I didn't get up, so I popped my last malaria pill and stabbed a morphine syringe in my arm.I arrogantly belted out, in my best James Brown voice, ""AND I FEEL GOOD! I KNEW THAT I WOULD NOW."" Then I saw it. Ho Lee Schitt was in the hands of one of my enemies. I was furious. I ran over to the dune buggy I saw, jumped on it, and ran him over. He was crawling on the ground begging for mercy. I crouched next to him, and shot him once in each eye. Ho Lee Schitt was mine again.I ran over to the two remaining men, murder in my eyes, and my tongue stretching out longer than Ace Frehley's. They each had a clear shot on me, and i risked getting buckshot all over my face and the ""PIMP"" tattoo on my licker; however, their rusty shotguns jammed, obviously because the bullets were scared of me. A quick bang here and a quick bang there and there were two less idiots in the world.""AND I FEEL NICE! LIKE SUGAR AND SPICE!"" I continued to sing. The adrenaline was coursing through my veins, and I jumped up in the air and high-fived my buddy. We stayed in the air for a full minute, like the end of some Van Halen concert on MTV or the closing credits of literally every episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. I was Born To Run, and against the better judgment of my friend, I kept rolling on that Thunder Road to the place beyond that guard post: New Jersey.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------""gr8 8/8 m8"" - IGNThis game is amazing, definitely the best in the series, and I dare say that it is the best FPS of 2008 (yes, I know that Call of Duty: World at War came out in 2008. What about it?)			"

												""See that plane? Last one out of the country""This review contains a good amount of history so the game is less confusing to people who arent fresh on African History, you have been warned. Farcry 2 is a game that will at first, confuse people from the newer games in the farcry series.To the untrained eye, this is a brutal, not fun, masochism sim. You will die, you will kill people you care about because they beg you to. You will run in the jungle away from packs of native Africans who are dying to cut your tendons and leave you to starve, but Malaria will get you first.To kill the confusion, lets have some backgroundFarcry 1 was essentially a linear half life style shooter, albeit an incredibly difficult one. It has almost nothing in common with farcry 3 and 4, which can be summed up as giant playgrounds of 0 difficulty.Farcry 2 is a mix. Open world, brutal, Quick tutorials, no holding your hand. This is Africa, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, not some cute little island, not the scenic mountains of India, every ♥♥♥♥ing thing in this country wants to kill and eat you, the people most of all. The big components of later games, stealth, vehicles, first aid in first person, etc, are present here, but are not given to you nicely. You may not even realize the stealth system, exists until you are in a bush with 10 men with machetes walking by on the road, and they dont see you.. puzzling you as you realize this game is deeper than it looked. In addition to all the features of later games, this game also has a ton of immersion. Your map is actually pulled out to use it, you get to pick from a selection of (Sadly only male) Characters and your choice affects your viewmodel, etc. Fire is even more realistic than later games and will change entire battles for minutes at a time, and is dynamic, If say for instance the fire spreads over a guys dropped gun or an ammo cache, the bullets might start going off from the heat, and best of all, guns deteroriate, and actually jam, realistically. One last mentionable feature which is quite interesting, is enemies in this game actually behave like people. They arent ludicrous men of no fear, they actually panic, and even flee. You will find yourself sniping a small outpost, and the last man you try to kill will book it into the jungle, the battle music stops, you raise a brow, you run around in the outpost like a tard trying to get him to notice you, assuming he just lost sight of you or ran the wrong way by accident,  but hes gone, he didnt want to die and instead of sitting around like every other NPC in every other game waiting to be shot, he ran away, Fight AND flight are represented here.To be fair and describe both pros and cons, the game is missing a few features. There are no dangerous animals such as lions or crocodiles (The game devs felt this would make an already unfair and cruel game too frustrating, but I wish they had added them) Theres some very ""African"" scenarios that were never played on, such as hunting or big dangerous game with a large caliber gun, for instance. And one feature I feel would be super nice to have had is the ability to use a gun in cars, not while driving like Farcry 3 and 4, but just pull up your gun, letting go of the wheel, that kinda thing. You get ambushed by people in cars with massive machineguns in the back ALOT in this game, so having to change seats or get out of the car every time is a -massive- pain. If you don't know anything about Africa, this game will also fly completely over your head, so let me spell out some stuff.This game models itself after African countries such as Angola, which were heavily affected by the cold war. Multiple sides, sporting nicknames like UNITA or the MPLA, sprouted up. These sides usually were based on their tribal and ethnic origins, but they pretended to be for whoever was sending them weapons. An MPLA officer may scream joy for the soviets who buy my guns, joy for communism, but what he means is ""Joy for my Tribe"" the two sides in most of these battles cannot be told apart, and in this game that occurs too, which confuses many a player trying to find which one they want to support. Once the cold war died down, these factions had lost their free toys, so now we have a bunch of tribes armed with ridiculously lethal weapons and no backers, so they start mining Africa's rich Diamond deposits and selling them off. These ""Blood diamonds"" fund wars in Africa that essentially still go on today. So, in this game, you are a merc hired to track down a man who trades weapons for these diamonds. To do so, you work with various factions whose names are all acronyms just like real life African war-factions. You may also get jobs from certain locals, missionaries, ""Princes"" to take care of dirty work in a country abandoned by the world.  You will fight men with machetes, rockets, flamethrowers, but Africa itself is your worst enemy. Between psycho wildlife, malaria always a mere spell of sickness away, and the humidity and weather rotting your guns into dust in your own hands, this country wants you dead.Do not buy this game expecting Farcry 3 africa edition. Buy this game expecting a rust-style survival simulator. Buy this expecting to be confused, afraid, lost, and desperate. Read heart of darkness, watch apocalypse now, get in that mood, that is the point. Do not buy this if you are afraid of unfair odds or unwinnable situations.The last bit ill touch on is the buddy system. This was introduced to make resource management and the overall stress level even more horrifying. You have people, who will try to help you stay alive in various ways. You have a main one and can have side ones, and theyll actually exist and can be found in ""Mikes bar"" and they interact with eachother and you. They can do a number of things, giving you info, offering alternate ways to take on missions (These ways drastically alter the way a mission is played and are up to you to choose or not) and If you ""die"" they may save you, drag you to safety, etc. But they can die, in battle, on the way back, heck, you might be saved, 30 minutes later find your bleeding out on the side of a riverbank, some militants in an airboat shot him up? Why? because he was there. You can heal him, with one of your expensive needles, but what if you are out? then you can leave him there I suppose.But he will beg you to end it... Embrace the pistol you put to his face, and you will pull the trigger.The last plane out left as you arrived. Death is the only way out now.			"

Cast your minds back to the holiday season of 2008, the original Dead Space released as a suprise hit, as well as the highly anticipated Fallout 3 from Bethesda, and of course Gaben graced us with the superb Left 4 Dead, and Far Cry 2, a sequel to a game that, by all accounts, had all but been forgotten to many, released on October 21st in North America.Showcasing a modified version of the CryEngine, dubbed the Dunia Engine, Far Cry 2 was certainly an impressive technical feat for its time, featuring dynamic weather, volumetric lighting, a realistic physics engine and perhaps most impressive of all, dynamic fire propagation, with fire acting in a realistic and driving manner. Ubisoft Montreal had taken over the reigns from Crytek who had moved onto pasture news with their Crysis franchise, and it was clear that the Dunia Engine was to be an important tool for the series, with future games in the series continuing to use the engine, as well as being used in conjunction with the Anvil engine in Assassins Creed 2 and Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. When looking back, 8 years later, its still hard to deny just how Far Cry 2 continues to look, holding up well with many more recent games in the series.Far Cry 2 takes place in a small, failed Central African state, currently embroiled in civil war. The government has recently collapsed, leaving two factions vying for control. At war are the United Front for Liberation and Labour, or the UFLL and the Alliance for Popular Resistance, abbrieviated to the APR. Your main goal is to find and assassinate the Jackal, an arms dealer who has been selling weapons to both sides of the conflict. It's worth noting also that Far Cry 2 is a sequel in name only, featuring none of the supernatural elements from the first game at all, though these elements were re-introduced in later games.Throughout the course of the games story, you are forced to work with both the UFLL and the APR, each using the player as a deniable agent in order to avoid a full-scale war. In addition to the hunt for the Jackal, you can provide the Underground with stamped travel documents for refugees in exchange for anti-malarial drugs, ambush convoys of weapon shipments in order to gain access to a greater variety of weapons and equipment from arms dealers, and assassinate targets acquired by intercepting signals from various cell-phone towers in the area. There really is no shortage of things to occupy you in this game, and while many people lament the all too common 'malaria attacks' for being more intrusive than compelling, it does help to break up the pace of the main plot, without feeling too much like padding out the games length.Realism was something that Ubisoft really wanted to push with this game, with features such as weapon degradation, the previously mentioned  dynamic weather system, a day and night cycle, as well as the aformentioned fire propagation mechanism. Weapons will become dirty over time and prone to jamming, eventually becoming completely unusable, you have to hold a physical map and use a handheld navigation system to get around, when vehicles are damaged you must perform a short repair animation and on top of this, you have to deal with a worsening affliction of malaria, having to take a pill in order to combat the blinding and potentially fatal effects of the illness.Many saw these 'realistic' features as little more than annoyances that distracted from the overall experience, and I disagree, these quirks were what made the game unique, and set the Far Cry 2 apart from its generic FPS roots. Far Cry 3 and 4 dumbed down the realistic features, and I felt the games regressed as a result, feeling more like an average open world shooter that are all too commonplace in the current market.The dynamic weather system allowed for different weather conditions such as storms and strong winds. And the time of day also affected the behavior of enemy AI, heightening their awareness at night, but hindering their ability to see the player in hiding, while during the hot part of the day the enemies might sheltering in the shade in groups, but be able to easily spot the player from a distance. Several species of animals can be encountered in the game, and while none of the wildlife found in the game pose any direct threat to the player they are able to distract the enemy, as well as make them aware of the player's presence. The previously mentioned dynamic fire propogation also played a key factor during enemy encounters, allowing a small fire to spread and eventually cause large brush fires, which could be used to the your advantage during combat if handled carefully. The behavior of fire is dependent on many factors such as wind speed and direction, rain, as well as the type ofvegetation. With fire spreading much more freely in the dry, grassy plains and savannahs compared to the humid jungle environments.These elements forced you to make tactical decisions when attempting missions, and is something that I really enjoyed during my original playthrough, it also added a great deal of replay value, with each encounter playing out differently depening on the conditions and time of day.Without going too much into it, as I sadly never got the chance to really play it back in 2008, there was also a multiplayer component to the game, which attempted to include many of the dynamic elements of the single-player game such as the use the of fire. As well as including a quite comprehensive map editor, something that was seen in the Far Cry also. This map editor was incredible, almost everything can be tweaked and tuned to your liking, and I actually had a lot of fun playing around with the various features of it, even without getting to actually use said maps in multiplayer, though I have since some pretty creative and impressive maps made online. Thankfully, the map editor managed to keep its place in future games in the series, with the exception of both Blood Dragon and Primal which were sadly solo experiences.Far Cry 2 will always be a bit of a difficult game to judge, it tried to do so much that I can't help but appreciate and commend Ubisoft Montreal for their ambition, even if some features could be considered annoying to many. None of the later games in the series have ever managed to capture the sheer scope,  and sense of freedom that this game had and for that reason it has to be considered the best in the series, and one that you should definitely pick up and play, either for the first time or for 100th time.

												Welcome to my review of Far Cry 2. I hope I can help you to decide if you want to buy this game or not. I will try to show you the positive sides and negatives also.Let's start with the fact that this FPS is one of the most immersive open world games you can find. All of your HUD is hidden and your map is in game (you have to bring it up to see where you want to go,there is no mini-map). When I said it is hidden,i meant that when you are exploring you won't see it,you will only see your health bar when you get hurt,and you will see your ammo when you are low or when you are about to reload.The sound design is amazing, except for the voice action. They speak super fast and without emotion, its kinda hilarious but you get used to it. Other than that the sound quality is superb. From winds at night, to listening to the wild life in the distance – you get such a good feeling when you are exploring on feet.Next the graphics – they are great for their time,but when you start the game you immidietly will see that they put a very big effort to make to world feel alive, the engine handles everything perfect – to the grass and trees to the enrupting flames when something blows up or you throw a molotov.There are a lot of mission to do.*Main Missions*Buddy Missions*Convoy*AssassinationWhen you go to a weapon vendor, you have a pass a mission so more guns will be unlocked.Also your guns wear down the longer you use them.They start to jam in a middle of fight and eventually break.So you have to always resupply at the vendor to keep your equipment up to shape.Last we will talk about buddy system and choices in the game.Your buddy is there to help you,when you go down,he comes and helps you – brings you to a save place while killing your attackers (which is cinematic).He can give an alternative way to pass a mission,and if he gets injured you can decide if you want to save him,or to leave him (or worse put a bullet in his head).Now let's talk negatives about this game.The biggest one is the respawning enemies.What I am talking about is,when you clear a checkpoint and leave it,and go for example 1km away to re-suply at weapon shop  and go back,they will be there again.Also if you try to skip it and just drive past it,they will shoot you down,and you have to fight them anyway.Also when you are exploring and traveling with your car,there will always be a jeep which is will come right to you and shoot you,so you have to stop kill them,and then move on (and again,again …).And when you are playing on higher difficulty is easier to just walk,because you can hide in the environment – but it takes more time to go from point A to point B.If you want a good open world game,in which the game does not hold your hand,you are free to explore whenever you want,do the mission how you like, and choose who you spare or kill. This is the game for you.If you can look past the respawning enemies and jeeps you will have a great time ranging from 20h to 30 depending if you do all the side mission or not.			"

												Yes, I recommend this game to anyone that wants a good playing game. It's worth $10. More than many of the other $10 games I have. Check out the videos on the store page and see for yourself. I've not tried mp yet. Not sure there is anyone playing mp?As for online game play, I didn't buy it just for that. I got it for the single player experience, only. I looked and there is no one that I know of, playing online these days. If you want to play online, you'll have to create a LAN server and play with friends. I have none around me that play these games or, any games at all that I know of? All-in-all, the game has a good SP experience if you like playing single player games. It will give you plenty of play time and it's open world to do as you please. Nothing runs in any perticular order, just play the game the way you want to, there's no time limits in it for missions or the like. Side missions are of your choosing and not mandatory. The game plays the way you want to play it. Your decisions are your own. However, your enemies are still your enemies. There's several mods for the game and a map editor for it so, do as you wish.By-the-way, you can launch your own dedicated server through the start window.			"

												When I first played this game, I underestimated on how addictive Far Cry 2 can be. I just cannot stop playing it and kept going on for hours.What the game did right: This game is similar to its predecessor but expands the limited open world that the first Far Cry game was trying to construct on.  The environment is now far more diverse, ranging from dry savannahs to humid jungles with thick vegetation.  There is also a dynamic weather system in which fog can overtake the land or a rainstorm can appear and change the way you play.Adding to its wide ranges of landscapes, I can argue one of the more ""tactical benefits"" this game boasts is its fire.  A lot of games have a blaze kept at a constant size but FC 2 offers greater realism in that part. Throw a Molotov Cocktail at a dry patch of grass and see the fire consume the grass with its voracious appetite but in a humid climate, it will inflict little damage.  The A.I. of your enemies are no longer the same ""dimwits"" that got slaughtered in FC 1. If you're spotted out in the open or make too much noise near guard posts, they will come for you. They also converse with each other and try to protect themselves from the player which reflects real life. In one instance, a downed mercenary will be helped by another merc. Stealth has been improved. If you're careful enough, your reward is being able to silently take down one enemy after another. For the most part, their awareness is fairly balanced, unlike FC 1 in which the mercs couldn't tell if someone else was firing a loud weapon but still could see the player behind tents and bushes. Also, your choices on when to use stealth makes a big difference. For example, you can go at night where potential assailants cannot easily see you but are alert. A unique feature that FC 2 has is its buddies. They are in the game to help you with missions, increase your reputation by providing optional quests, or save you if your well-being has been thrashed to zero. I do enjoy interacting with them upon taking missions. When combining the aforementioned aspects, you can do missions with almost any mentod you want.  You can either quitely sneak past foes or go in guns blazing. It's all up to you. Exploring doesn't easily get dull and the replay value is high.While I do favor this game, some problems are existant. What the game should have avoided doing wrong:The voice acting for most of the characters is inauspicious. Most of the characters speak too fast and have a flat tone. One of your buddies' dialogue sounds like it was taken from Google translate and that makes it inauthentic. Over time, the side missions get repetitive. The ""convoy missions"" are the most subjected to this.  It gets quickly mundane to find circling rival arms vendors and blow up their trucks. The worst part is if you want to have better weapons sooner, there's no other way around this other than to proceed through the main objectives most of the time. The ""weapon degradation system"" is one that I have debated in choosing if it's interesting to keep in a game or conclude it's mostly annoying to have in a firefight. As of now, I have decided that it's a nuisance as some weapons degrade too quickly and jam at the worst times. Also, close to the end of the game, even with reliability upgrades, the game will punish you if your shots miss too much and you cannot obtain new weapons (unless you stored them).Also, the malaria mechanism is very annoying, with no way to ever stop it, only delay it. When you're under attack by that damn disease, you can barely see well and cannot sprint away from danger. Although it doesn't last that long, it may cost some precious seconds for you to flee. The diamond cases in this game may somewhat excite newcomers for a while but it's painful to endure when trying to reach for some diamonds on a cliff. Although not necessary to find, it's just a distraction from what the game can truly offer. I did mention you can interact with your buddies, but that's very limited.  All you can do is accept 2 of their quests and after that, they will just say ""hi"" if you meet them regularly. The (re)spawning of enemy mercenaries in certain locations is downright stupid. In one case, you can take down all enemies in a base but when you leave for a certain distance and look back with a scope, the place is then refilled with enemies as if nothing has happened. The developers should have put a time limit in how fast enemies can respawn when you're sufficiently far away. The A.I. is good when confronting them but when they drive, it's a mess. The drivers tend to have problems in making a  U-turn and are horrible in judgement. One time, a patrol car tried to run me over but it missed and plunged into the water.Finally, the storyline is woefully linear. Though understandable, your choices are very narrow and don't have much impact on the game. Trying to avoid providing spoilers, it's the same ""bad"" ending, if you decide to detonate some explosives or bribe some border guards to help out a fleeing country in need. Other: I haven't tried out multiplayer yet but I have heard that it's dead, which is sad. However, if you feel like allowing your imagination demanding to make a map with the African landscape, there is a map editor that is easy to use. Shamefully, it's quite limited and it's meant for multiplayer. Customizing this game is almost impossible to do, unlike most games. For those who wish to mod, they will be sadden that this is almost unachievable. Still, there are a few mods that can enhance the game (and perhaps tweak balance), like Dylan's Realism Mod. Conclusion:This game is definitely worth a purchase. While it may have cons, the pros in this game will entertain you and not disappoint you for at least one playthrough. If you're bored of playing games that trap you in confined spaces, get this game and feel how open it is.			"

												Out of all the Far Cry games, this one is the most difficult and I love it. Let me tell you why.All the good stuff in game down below.● The AI might seem simplistic at first, but they are sharp as knife. They hear you whenever you stealth kill a guard, pull out a weapon, move in bushes. Every move you make, they can hear out and instantly know where you are. For some, this might be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but for others, a pleasant thing. This makes you get creative about destroying outposts etc..● Bunch of weapons to choose from, from flare guns to IED's. Variety of ways destroying convoys, assasinations etc...● The setting itself, it looks just as Central-Africa, large deserts, jungles, savannas and  animals moving around. There is just something about that orange look I love.● Fun and appropriate side missions, enjoyable assasinations, blowing up weapon convoys, same goes for buddy missions● At some point story becomes cool, intense as ♥♥♥♥.● Golden AK's, nuff said.● Exploring with Glider is the most enjoyable thing ever until you get one shotted midair by a guard with a fricking pistol miles away.● Weapon jam, suck it FC3 and FC4● Malaria to remember you that approximately 30-40 mins in real life have passed by.● Instantly respawning guards at guard posts to make you mad and waste your ammo and health kits. Hell I love this, wish FC3&4 had it.A few negative things also though- Basicly every mission requires you to drive someplace far asf and the instant spawning guardposts might trigger some players.- Glitches here and there.- Cars doesn't feel like cars, they get stuck everywhere, always the same speed, sound...Definitely a great game, 100% recommend!

												Back when Ubisoft wasn't complete sh*t and they made masterpieces.Played this back in 2009 on Xbox 360 and even to this day I still feel it was ahead of it's time.Pros:*Aged very well visually and even at maxs settings is a very pretty game.*Natively support Ultrawide Monitors and other custom resolutions.*Fire*Very uniquely written story albeit a tad loose.*Africa*Blood Diamonds*Golden AKs*Weapon Degradation that adds to the survival vibe*Foliage and environments are EXTREMELY believable and I actually FEEL like I'm in Central Africa.*Not tied to Uplay*very detailed healing mechanic that's SUPER brutal. (such as pulling twigs and bullets out of your arms and such)*Lots to see and explore.Cons:Not much to do end game after getting all diamonds and equipment (But still have LOTS to do before then.)

												Heard a lot of negative press about this game, and while some of it was certainly true, the flaws were far from bad enough to ruin the game.I really enjoyed this, I can't really put my finger on why though. The wide open spaces were enjoyeble to wander through, and though there was no variety in enemy you could create your own variety in the tactics you used to deal with them. Weapon choice seemed to have a big impact on combat, you could try and pick them off from afar with long range weapons or maybe run and gun with a shotgun and some grenades. How about starting a fire and using the resulting confusion to take advantage of the situation? Maybe just take a different route and avoid combat all together. The environments were much better looking and more varied than I expected and although there could have been more variety in the missions, I never found them to be a drag as they usually made you explore new parts of the map.

												Beautiful but empty world.The guns are a blast to use but the knife is horrible. You can't stealth with a knife??Driving is fun but not after hours and hours and hours of it. WAY too much back-tracking. The few fast travel spots are always out of the way and you're better off driving/running/boating which eventually makes travel an extreme burden.Practically all the missions are fetch quests. Get mission, go out, do X, come back, repeat. I wouldn't mind this but the fact that you can't have multiple missions makes me want to cry because the game forces you to do them one by one.Story is extremely bleh.Enemy respawns becomes a pain. Enroute to location A, I clear out enemy post B, to make it to location C. On the way back (because the fast travel locations are rarely useful), enemy post B is full of enemies again even though I was just there 5 minutes ago. This is how a game tells you that your actions do not matter and have no effect on the world.FC2 had potential and it's exhibited FC3 as they fixed most of the problems. If you have played FC3 prior to FC2, DO NOT PLAY. You have been spoiled with all the fixed mechanics. I certainly was.			"

												Shoot people, start fires, drive cars, blow things up. This is about all you'll be doing in Far Cry 2 but when it's this much fun and so immersive, it doesn't really matter. Far Cry 2 is a stripped back version of what the current series is all about and if you don't mind spending 10 minutes driving to your next objective, in between suffering from malaria attacks, you will have a great time.It runs like greased lightning on toasters as well.Full video review:

												This is a game you either really love or really hate. Everything in the entire game is there for 1 reason only: to kill the player. Ranging from infinite respawning guard posts to jamming weapons and malaria (oh that malaria...), every freaking thing is hell-bent on killing you every step you take.Should you buy this game, I have two recommendations: Install a realism mod and up the difficulty a bit to at least hardened. Both this mod and this one are really good. Recently a new supermod in the form of this one was released. Take the game at a slow pace. The faster you want to finish missions, the game, your enemies, or anything for that matter, the faster the game throws everything it has at you. And don't be mistaken, you will die. Take it slow, plan your attack a bit. 99/100 times your plan goes awfully wrong, so all that you're left with is complete and utter chaos anyway.Do yourself a favor and buy this game. Nevermind how much is wrong or broken, it's an experience you will never ever forget. (I've played through it 3x on my Xbox and 1st time on my PC now, I still enjoy it!)			"

												Not much of a review guy, so this will probably be the only game i'll ever review on steam. This is also going to be a little biased and you'll see why in a second.Okay first off, the world itself is amazing. For a game made in 2008, the level of detail in the world and atmosphere is phenomonal. The music that comes along with it is great, changing whether or not the game detects you being in a fire fight or not. The character models are also good, no two seem to look the same although they do have similarities. Only gripe would be the voice acting; characters mouths dont always seem to move in sync with the dialogue. The map is massive, and you'll spend a good amount of time driving to locations or maybe just walking like I usually do. If you're not a patient person, and need to have some kind of action 24/7, this won't be for you. The action is there, and explosions and gun fights happen frequently, but if you're expecting the rushed delivery from something like CoD or Battlefield, stray away. Theres a good selection of weapons to choose from once you've done a bunch of the convoy missions. Some include different snipers (Dragunov, AS50), submachine guns (MAC-10, UZI), Assault Rifles (AK, AR-15) and theres rocket launchers, a dart rifle to sneak around with, a mortar and a 6 round grenade launcher. Theres more aswell I just dont remember everything. All will deteriorate and jam once used too much, so you've got to keep an eye on your loadout or you'll run into an outpost empty handed and get slaughtered. You can only carry 4 weapons at a time, and choose wisely or you'll be stuck in long range engagement with a shotgun, pistol and a flamethrower. You can choose how aggressive or passive you want to play depending on your loadout which gives the game some replay value if you went through the campaign once and only played a certain way. The game is a ton of fun once you get past the tutorial (which only lasts about 10-20 mins).If i have to mention some cons, here are some. The respawning enemies at outposts can be annoying sometimes I suppose, but if they didnt respawn youd clear out all of them and then just be driving around an empty map that sure is well designed and beautiful, but wouldnt have any of the action youd expect from an FPS. Sound design from gun sounds to weather to just everything in general is really good, but if you're bothered by a characters mouth not being in sync with their dialogue then...yeah. AI can be a little finnicky sometimes, you can be on a rock in some cliff sniping down on an enemy outpost, put a bullet in a guys head, and his friend right beside wont even notice or react. Other times they'll find your location right away and immediately start firing at you. Enemies seem to take a little too much damage sometimes. When I played this game before I always carried a sniper so i could kill most people from a good distance with a headshot and its a one shot one kill, but if youre going in with an AR and thats all, you can put around 15 rounds into someone and they wont die. Other times they will. Its weird sometimes, but it doesnt really take away from the game in my opinion. It's just something you get used to. One thing I was disappointed by when I bought this was there not being any multiplayer. I try to create a Ubi.com ID and it just says theres a problem with the Far Cry 2 servers. Not a big deal, for only 3.50 its a good pickup especially for a great campaign. Theres some things i've probably missed, but for just 3 dollars, please just try this game. Its an absolute masterpiece. I played this game for YEARS literally when I bought it on PS3. Had thousands of hours invested online and beat the campaign dozens of times. Havent played in a while so I figured I'd pick it up on PC and give it another go. That's why this review is biased though, I have so many memories with this game and it's what got me into FPS games which lead me into COD4 and then into the cods after that. It sounds nerd as ♥♥♥♥ but Far Cry 2 had a special place in my heart and I wont forget this game. Not too many others I can say that about. 10/10.			"

												Far Cry 2 is a open world first person shooter with some small RPG elements set in the African savannah.You have a aim, killing the Jackal, the person who supply the African war groups with weapons and causes the whole country to suffer even more.When arriving in Africa you get driven by a taxi driver to the main city Pala.While driving through the magnificent looking landscape you see several things and also notice your Malaria.You get a Malaria attack and get unconscious.You wake up in a house in Pala and see your enemy, the jackal.He decides who lifes and dies and he lets you alive.After this you have to get out and get unconscious again after a while.You get saved by a group called UFLL. There are 2 groups who have war against each other.UFLL and APR. Who is the good and the bad have you to decide even though both are not perfect.I personally prefer the UFLL. Only my opinion though.On your way through the story you visit a lot of places and meet your buddies who help you.I wont say more to dont spoiler too much.The gameplay is actually very nice. I love the first person weapon handling.It feels realistic and there is a big range of weapons to choose from.All being buyable in the Weapon Store for diamonds.Thats the currency of the game.You can also buy upgrades for you and your weapon.Your weapons degrade! Maybe too fast for some but for me its fine, especially with upgrades.You can change them for free in your Weapon room and ""repair"" them like that.I wouldnt recommend using weapons of the enemies, they are weak and in bad quality.You often get quests to finish certain aims. The mission variety is fine even though not big.But its fine for my taste. You mostly get diamonds or medicine for completing quests.You can also find collectables in the game. Diamond suitcases with 1-3 diamonds in each and Jackal tapes.There is a incredible amount of this stuff. Also there are 8 gold AKs in the whole world.The difficulty is higher than normal. Dont try rushing over the enemy, this mostly wont work. You always have to watch out. And the health doesnt regenerate, at least not completely. You need some sort of medics to heal yourself and you cant carry unlimited of those.The open world is extremely big and you have your feet, cars, boats or the bus to reach several places.Busses are helpful for those who prefer fast traveling even though the busses just have 5 stations per map.Enough for me though. The fact that you have to travel actually I like about the game.Its nice visiting the landscape and I like this sort of oldschool traveling.Some may dont like this sort of system but I love it.While travelling you will often pass some sort of checkpoints of the enemy who will shoot you on sight.Each of those checkpoints have some special ammo or medicine. Mostly with around 5 enemies at each point.A little bit annoying about this game is the way how the Enemies respawn and hunt you with their cars after they saw you. You mostly have to kill the car until you can continue passing. Also the enemy is often faster than you. After you erased a point, the enemies will respawn fast after going away and come back and that is the most negative point about the game. I got used to it, even though I agree its not perfect. Beside of those checkpoints there are also other places which are often specially named. Places like bases of the enemy. Trainyards, camps, whatever. There are often 10+ enemies and you should watch out, most of those places you see automatically while doing missions.There are also animals in the nature, around 5 sorts of animals in the whole game. Realistic behaviour and they shun humans. I often think they could add more animals and also hunting animals but on the other hand its not as unrealistic as in Far Cry 3. The animals there are to much if you ask me.The graphics and engine in general are amazing.I rarely saw so much realism. The whole engine simulates real world nature. Wind, rain, sun and day cycle.The graphics in general look amazing. Especially fire effects. Definitely 10/10 in terms of graphics especially for 2008.Some say Crysis or CryEngine 2 is better but I think they are equivalent. The Dunia Engine just has its aim on realistic day/night cylcle and weather cycle. A little part of the CryEngine is in the Dunia Engine btw!The Music is also amazing and fits perfectly into the whole setting.The African setting like that is pretty unique and thats great.The Multiplayer is ok.Some sort of CoD sort of Multiplayer which is just more realistic in general.Not many people play it online anymore though.Fortunes Edition DLC:This is a small DLC which adds 3 new weapons, some new cars and some new Multiplayer maps.Nothing special but not bad either.And now our favorite part.Can it compete against Far Cry 3?I say yes.Its maybe not everyones taste but Far Cry 2 counts to my favorite games and can compete against Far Cry 3.It maybe doesnt have so many gameplay tweaks as Far Cry 3 but I like this rustical way how Far Cry 2 handles everything. Reminds me a little bit of oldschool games. Not a lot of gimmicks but everything thats neccessary to have a nice game. I love the atmosphere of the game. The whole nature is amazing and the music fits perfectly into the game. Maybe its even better than Far Cry 3 in this part.Some of you are maybe spoilered of Far Cry 3.Try ignoring the things that Far Cry 3 does better.I already played the game 2009 and I loved it back then.Far Cry 2 maybe isnt perfect but it does a lot of things right and it has a great experience.You should definitely try it especially because of the price. I think the game will get 9/10 from me, maybe overrated but I think this score fits good for me. Make yourself an own picture of the game and dont listen to people who say its bad.			"

												Far Cry 2 is an action open world game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It was released in October 2008. You, play as a mercenary sent into Africa in the midst of a war between the APR and UFLL. Both sides are wanting power and control of the nation. This review will discuss the campaign and the open world element and provide a general recommendation in the conclusion.  Campaign  Far Cry 2 features a very good and tight campaign. The story is simple, you are a merc and you will bid for any of the factions that pay you the most. The caveat is you have to complete missions for both sides, which do eventually learn that you are doing work for the enemy. Story-wise, the game really drives down the power hungry aspect of things in which you have to assassinate leaders, and multiple of them. It’s a strong narrative and I immensely enjoyed the story and the twisting elements of it. Furthermore, I did not experience the 'Ubisoft bug' where it hits about 15 hours in the game and it feels like a chore to complete it, which is a refreshing thing to say about an older Ubisoft game.The main characters in the game, whether it is enemy characters or allied buddies, have distinct personalities. In particular, your buddies have a very brief journal in the game that allows you to discover and learn of their background. Buddies are important because when you gain a main mission they contact you to provide an alternative approach to the mission, which has many benefits including making the mission easier, increasing your reputation and upgrading your safe house. Further into the game it becomes fairly irrelevant as you get more powerful.  Open World  The open world element is very nice, it isn't too large but it isn't small. There are two maps, both have safe zones, and a variety of areas including enemy guard posts, gun shops, and so forth. All of these provide the open world aspect of it. Furthermore, the side missions actually add to the game. For instance, you can get missions from the church to help you cure your malaria illness, which is essential. Or, you can go to the gun shop and do their specific missions to unlock more weapons for you to purchase. In other words, side missions are not filler, rather the majority of them add to the experience of the game. The gameplay portion is absolutely fun and realistic. If you have shoddy weapons for example, they can jam mid-battle causing you to flee before retackling the objective. The story is realistic in that there is no money, rather the currency is diamonds. I enjoyed the little things in the game per say as they added realism to the game.  Issues  I experienced some notable annoyances and glitches. The first was the health system because the enemy somehow have very accurate accuracy as it hurts if they hit you and it takes several bullets to hit them, which actually becomes annoying and unrealistic. Furthermore, I absolutely hated enemies automatically respawning at guard posts. Second, when you answer the phone during missions or at any time during the game, the dialogue does not pop up on the screen and there is no sound, meaning there is a glitch. Lastly, there were multiple crashes when trying to save the game.  Conclusion  Far Cry 2 is a pretty good game. It features a thrilling story that is both compelling and immersive. It provides a very realistic and accurate take on the current state of civil war in Africa in contemporary times. I enjoyed the gameplay, in particular the elements that made it more realistic such as weapon jamming and weapons getting rusty. In contrast, there are major glitches relating to dialogue and crashes that did hurt my play-through. I feel this game would have been excellent provided there was no multiplayer and the focus was the single player as it was nearly great. In saying that, I totally recommend this game, as I enjoyed it considerably.  Rating  8/10  Pros  	- Excellent story with twists and turns.	- Gameplay.	- Realism. 	- Side missions as they did not feel like filler content.  Cons  	- Crashes.	- Bugs within the game.	- Enemy AI, in relation to gameplay but also enemy respawning.If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												This is a classic challenging Fps game with very little hand holding, devepment and plot. You are attacked by both factions on every mission because you are a Mercenairy, every mission explains this.The outposts respawn (get reinforced) because they are at strategical map locations in a war torn country. Your guns jam and deteriorate because you are in a humid jungle and well guns just ♥♥♥♥ing jam (something no other games hold Stalker, have implimented) which is so realistic and only adds to the experience. The world becomes more alive and realistic than other farcry games with better pixels because of a slight breeze, blowing dust and circling birds. The absolute pinnacle of this game is the guns. Oh my the guns are done very well. The sounds, the effectiveness of each different one. Every single shot you fire ejects a shell which makes a corresponding sound depending on what it strikes. Its the Primitiveness of the plot and story and the extremely advanced weapon handling system that make this game so great. All the things i listed are what casuals think are wrong with this game. Yet they make the game prob one of the most immersive best fps titles you can experience. Im glad that this game is a love or hate it affair. Its the perfect example of a game that seperates real elitist hardcore players who want to be pushed and challenged and actually feel like they are in a hostile environment. Instead of casual vaping hipsters playing one of their 10 titles of the day for 1 hours and writting it off as broken or bad within the first 30 mins. Really nothing compares to Farcry2 for immersion. The only thing i can think of is Stalker: SOC which is superior even completely broken and glitched.This game is smooth. It lacks any drama ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t plot that seems to glue most current gen games together. Its primitive raw FPS like games of the past. Its the Darksouls of FPS games where any wrong move or a venture down the wrong path can mean immediate death.			"

												OK, and now for the review i have been waiting to do......What can i say about this game, aside that i believe it's about as close to perfection as a game can get...???  From the AI, the weapons, the amount of immersion, graphics, story, sound, everything in this game just oozes awesomeness.  This was a game that managed to draw a fine line between what people enjoyed and didnt.  Either you absolutely hated it, or you loved it dearly, with no middleground.  Most of the complaints revolved around the respawning checkpoints, which didnt bother me because, well, IT IS a shooter afterall.  If you're playing a shooter and you're not shooting something, then it can get a little boring sometimes.  First on the discussion list is the story.  Loosely based on the short book titled ""Heart of Darkness,"" the story has the player hunting an arms dealer named The Jackal who supplies two rival factions with an armory to start, and continue waging war against each other.  On your journey you aid both factions in search of information of the Jackal's whereabouts.  Now, this isnt a story that unfolds like you initially think it will.  Far Cry 3's story is very similar in context, but told in a more dude-bro lingo, while Far Cry 2 does so in a rich, yet immensly dark tone that will test what kind of man (or woman) you would become in this situation.  Considering that you're thrown into a real-world senario in a fictional African country, the story is constantly unfolding without the player even knowing.  Many games these days have taught us that the story is only told through dialogue or cutscenes, but this game has a story that unfolds with every bullet you fire, and every death you cause.  It's a morailty tale that might give each player the insight as to who or what kind of person he or she is, or will become.  The gunplay is some of the best i've personally encountered in any game.  From the sniper rifles, to the assault rifles, to my personal favorite, the 6P9 silenced Makarov, every gun feels rather unique in its own right.  Each sniper rifle has a different characteristic, the 2 rocket launchers each perform differently, even (most of) the pistols perform differently.  And, of course, everyone's favorite is unlockable very early in the game:  the flare gun.  Spreading fire was the key innovative feature in this game, and when done correctly is a very strategic tactic when taking on the numerous guardposts.  The AI is unscripted and acts accordingly to you.  If you haven't engaged the targets, they talk amongst themselves.  If they think someone is nearby, they will slowly approach the location of the disturbance.  Also, your reputation determines how aggressively the AI will combat you.  The lower your reputation is means the AI will hunt you down because they dont fear you.  The higher the reputation is the more cautious they are, meaning they may find cover or try to flank you.  The graphics and sound seem very dated in 2015, but for it's time it was top notch.  Some might argue that the graphics in Far Cry 2 are better overall than Far Cry 3.  When you factor in small details like shadow resolution, texture quality, and Ambient Occlusion, Far Cry 2 does have the upper hand over 3.  Lastly, the immersion plays a pivotal role in this game.  There is next to no regenerating health and health is restored using syringes or water bottles.  Malaria can attack you at any given point, although as your symptoms improve the time between attacks increases.  When very low on health your character performs a ""surgical technique,"" in what is basically described as one of the coolest animations in a video game.  Gruesome, sure.  Cool???  You bet!I've logged over 600 hours in this game on steam, and another 200+ on disk, and almost all invested in single player.  I can't even describe why i keep coming back to this game so much.  Maybe it has to do with the fact that this game allows my imagination to run wild in the combat senarios.  Maybe because the story is that engaging.  I don't know.  What i do know is that since this game came out 6+ years ago, i've only found 1 other game like it, and it still doesn't hold a candle to this sheer brilliance.  Advice for new players reading this???  Give the game some time.  Allow yourself to sink into the story and REALLY think about your every action and what it's doing to you.  Study how every decision you make affects YOU, not your character, but YOU.  And for the love of god, play with all the guns.  There's only 31 guns (with DLC).  9.8/10			"

												Far Cry 2 is one of those games that any reviewer on youtube loves to ♥♥♥♥ all over, hell alot of Steam reviews will ♥♥♥♥ all over it and rightfully so. Despite being an amazing game, Far Cry 2 has a lot of design issues. Outposts can respawn within an hour, there are long periods of tedious traveling and driving to destinations followed by sporadic moments of shooting two dudes in a car, all of the missions are basically the same ""kill this"" or ""blow this up"", the buddy system is underdeveloped, picking a character has literally no effect on the game and the soldiers of both factions are out to kill you, even when your doing a mission for one of the factions! With the lazily given reason for this being that your mission is supah secret and no one knows about it. The Malaria gimmick is more annoying than an interesting part of gameplay and the world feels very static, with no sight of civilians around the country-side (which the intro cut-scene shows). Instead  they're hiding inside huts waiting for you to give them passports in exchange for your malaria medication. The actual world is populated by respawning soliders and mercenaries and the wild life is just there so you can watch the hilarious ragdoll physics go into effect when you hit them with your car. Finding Diamond briefcases can be frustrating (and also makes no sense), increasing your ""reputation"" does nothing except make the enemies say different dialogue and have better weapons over time. And finally the way you heal damage by viscerally resetting broken fingers and pushing bullets out of your gaping wounds is brutal and awesome to watch at first, but reaches Monty Python levels of comedy when it is done multiple times in a single gunfight.And yet, This game is ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic because what it does it does better than almost any other game. Its firefights are fantastic with smart A.I. that leaves you with a exhilarating sense of an adrenaline rush combined with a real sense of fear due to the fact that the enemies will do everything in its power to ♥♥♥♥ you. Along with a fire mechanic that frankly is nothing more than a gorguous piece of artwork as you watch it spread throughout the dried grass and trees of the country-side and into the enemy base with the backdrop of an orange setting sun. The African environment feels so real, like you can really feel just how hot and unpleasant it must be just by looking at that beating sun in the sky and the shriveled up grass in the plains. Enemies constantly complain about the heat and there are empty plastic water bottles scattered everywhere. Furthermore, when you enter the bases of the Factions, you can almost feel the humidity and the laziness it would create as papers and garbage are thrown on the floor as its occupants are to drenched in sweat to really care. It reminds me of my apartment in the Summer. NPC dialogue is interesting to hear, especially in gunfights as they try to take you out and their hectic screams and grunts make them seem less like the super badass soldiers from every other shooters but simple mercenaries who are desperate to survive and leave this ♥♥♥♥-hole country. A combination of their smart tactics and scared dialogue makes them seem like a threat that would play out similarly in a real life scenario and at times you even feel bad for them as it's clear despite their advantage in numbers, they're just as scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as you are and do their hardest to look out for their fellow comrades.In fact the sound design is fantastic all around, all the voice acting is great and the standout performance of the ""villain"" The Jackal, provides a small amount of social commentary as he justifies his lifestyle as an arms dealer. All of the guns sound really good and the cracklings of that fire are pure eargasm. The music of conga drums being violently beaten as combat starts really provides a minimal but effective approach that makes the firefights even more savage. Though an issue with the latter is that the congas start anytime you fire a gun and only stops when it's clear you were just ♥♥♥♥ing around with a goat or chicken. lulz.Alot of the issues I mentioned in the first paragraph were fixed with Far Cry 3, which is also an amazing game. The world is lush and colorful and there is a lot to do other than shooting, there are soldiers that are on your side and also patrol the country side and will fight with you. There is Flora and Fauna that is actually dangerous to the player along with a hunting aspect. The Story is more developed with popular characters like Vaas, and of course, the ♥♥♥♥ing bases don't respawn. But Far Cry 2 still manages to remain relevant despite all of the improvements the third entry made. Simply because Far Cry 3 can't beat the 2nd game at what it does best: Gunfights and its fire mechanic. Far Cry 3 is an amazing game, but it feels very ""video gamey"". Far Cry 2 is less like a traditional Game and more like a simulation. But more than that it's a extremely unfair simulator with the cards very clearly stacked against you in every encounter, often with snipers and rocket launcher dudes covering all entrances to bases and a group of a dozen or more soldiers ready to flank you and kill you quickly while you're in the midst of suffering from a sudden bout of malaria. It's a game that is unapologetic in how dirty and below the belt it plays. Which is why the game suddenly begins to click when you, the player, begin to play like just as much of a dirty ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, if not more so. Use flamethrowers and molotov cocktails to make fires spread to bases and mow down the fleeing soldiers, throw grenades in areas where there are ammo boxes so that bullets begin exploding and hitting any enemy near enough to get sprayed. Buy an upgraded camo suit and silently one shot enemies in the head with your silenced pistol before taking your machine gun and killing the rest while they're off guard. Learn the layout of the land and use it to flank enemies, plant IED's on your jeep and then jump off it as it speeds into the base, then detonate it. Use a ♥♥♥♥ing mortar to scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of the enemies and make them scatter so you can pick them off one by one.And my personal favorite. Give a non fatal shot to an enemy so that he is crying and crawling out in the open. His buddy, his dearest friend in the whole wide world will come out to try to hoist him up and get him to safety. And you just kill them both.While Far Cry 3 is a very pretty game, with that whole paradise in hell motif going on. Far Cry 2's world is just as beautiful but in a more gritty and harsh way: Everything seems grimy, dusty and dirty, weapons that you pick up off of dead enemies and not from gun stores are rusty pieces of ♥♥♥♥ that break easily. The houses barely look like they can stand (a detriment to the game that you can't actually blow them up red faction style) and villages themselves look depressing with the lack of civilians and only soldiers, giving you an impression of what happened before you arrived on the scene. All the characters you interact with are greedy, evil ♥♥♥♥♥ that actively bring suffering upon the local populace for their own gain and their various mercenary lieutenants and your fellow buddies are more often then not, just scared people who got scammed into a war whose factions don't actually have the money to pay them and they're stuck unable to get out. It's an ugly, nihilistic game which despite its flaws ironically makes it one of the best games to come out in that decade, despite all its problems.			"

												Some kind of paradox, that game is. It takes name from very famous FPS Far Cry - and giving a very diverse experience. So, basically, like heritor of Far Cry - it sucks really. First Far Cry was in its core quite oldschool shooter (like Doom or Half Life) - just with so many fixes as one could imagine 10 years back (like outstanding physics, witty and challenging level design, clever AI behavior).There, in Far Cry 2 - we have a nice engine, yes. AI may not be very smart... but it has some explanation by overall agenda. We're talking about setting of that game. It rests in the middle of some civil war in Africa, in one of many so called ""countries"" where state wasn't existed at all and people continuosly swallowing by warmonger tribes habits. That quite realistic setting lies so far from ""just a tropical island afar from anywhere, where some mad doctor making a war mutants from mercs"" - base of first Far Cry. But not a sip of realism made diversion between first and second games. Far Cry 2 is a sandbox. That's her bless and curse.Let's start with bad side: I quote there since I cannot say better: ""Driving across beautiful but lifeless world while fighting infinitely respawning enemies to complete unimaginative missions for people who all try to kill you"" (yougamers)Where first Far Cry gameplot offers dramatic episodes ""like in the movies"", sandbox game just leaves you to entertain yourself by continuous driving through the countryside, killing almost everyone on sight. Gameplot is awful, storyline doesn't have any cultural value. Just a reference to a movie ""Lord of War"". Protagonist (any of them) its just a brief bio like ""Tall, strong, divorced, reserved, alcohol habits"". No personality besides that. Mandatory ""twist"" in the midst of game just slightly changing decorations, nothing more. Ok, there are some little ""twists"" around every story mission, but it's just a choice between two shootouts, with big blood or with much-more-than-big blood spilled. Oh, and story motivation - running from one dose of drug to another - kinda frustrating, I guess.Now, question - is it worth playing at all?Well, yeah, there is a good part.This particular FPS game still a way more wiser than any flat but overrated shooters like whole bunch of Call of Duty series. While it's not as complex and addictive as Stalker games, for some points it's easily beats Ukranian games. For a start, it's size feature. Big vastes can be depressing, but, when you are planning to hit a conwoy or clear up a fortress full of soldiers all by yourself, you surely need some room for elbows (Bewegungsfreiheit, as Germans might said). And, all of sudden, moving in these vastes could be quite relaxing. Natural. Really, I've just played Far Cry for 7 hours not completing any missions. Just wandering around and collecting hidden diamonds. Game setting fits just right to simple wandering around. Almost like you're on vacation, on safari, of kind.Sadly, we have a very few FPS games in one-player modus, that allows player choose it's destination, planning your moves before rushing forward in battle, and using long-range rifles from distance more than 100 meters. Project IGI comes in mind now, for some missions (not completely). Xenus (another Ukranian game) - an ambitious sandbox, but poorly executed. Op.Flashpoint/ARMA are too simulating to be fun. What else?Overall: While many might find Far Cry 2 too boring, it has its own place. Like it was with Assassin's Creed 1, which too was a pretty boring openworld experience. If you can look behind its bad sides, game's good one, with some originality, charisma and clever details.Fair 7.5/10 in my collection.			"

												Possibly the most hostile and cruel game I have ever played. It drops you in an open world with guard checkpoints, snipers, rocket launcher dudes, patrolling machine gunners, and enemy millitary bases with nothing but the weapons you can scrounge together and the vehicles you steal. This might sound like every other far cry game, but this one takes every oppertunity it can to beat you down further. ""Are you enjoying blasting people with that shotgun? Too bad! it's jammed now!""""Do you like driving really fast away from machine gun trucks? Too bad! Your engine was shot!""""I bet you love that rocket launcher. Too bad because it just spat a defective rocket at your feet. You have <1 second to run away.""Unlike the later entries in the series this one does not try to accomodate the player. It won't ""give you,"" anything. You have to get it yourself. The vehicles wont get you out of a sticky situation. You have to get yourself out, possibly while using vehicles. Every cool thing that happens in the game is all because of what the player ""forces,"" to happen. You have to actually think about what you're going to do. For a clearer picture: You are pinned down by enemies in a base. You see a truck. You think you might be able to crawl your way to it without taking too much damage, but you also know that you need to drive it into cover before the enemies bust the engine. You remember seeing a river a short distance from the base before you snuck in. You figure that the river might have a few boats on it near the docks. Now you have a plan. ""rush to the truck, drop it into the river, get out, swim to a boat. hope nobody sees you escaping. All while every part of your plan goes wrong in exactly the way you thought it would."" Weapons fizz out, truck breaks down just as you flip it into the river."" None of it is scripted, and all of it is trying to kill you at all times. The fun of the game all comes from beating the system rigged against you. That is why I reguard this as the definitive Far Cry game. Too bad that the multiplayer doesn't work without modding though. Also: if you suck at video games, this one will kick your [Censorship]Sidenote: The game is actually far more rewarding to play on higher difficulties, while only allowing yourself to save outside of military outposts. It's not a genuinely difficult experience unless your getting pinned down by as few as one or two enemies and having to ration out your two or three health syringes. You will die a lot in the beginning, but as you learn the ropes of how to survive, the game will become far more enjoyable than it ever was before. Much like the artificial progression of the third game, giving the character abilities that make him an awesome warrior, this one slowly transforms you into something similar, but instead of giving you abilities, you actually become better at the game and thus, equally badass. Instead of watching a character grow more powerful, you are the character, growing more powerful.			"

												I beat this game many times a long time ago. It is an impressive game with some flaws you can tolerate in order to enjoy the rest of the experience.Even now with its outdated graphics is tremendous fun. In my opinion, it is the last Far Cry game made well, before Ubisoft started with their nonsensical spree in the form of Far Cry 3, 4 and Primal. Just stupid things. They should have kept the quasi realism you find in Far Cry 2, and stop the fantasy of adding more and more things. More is not always better.			"

												Give me FarCry 2 any day. Destroyable gas stations, respawning checkpoints (I have no idea why people hated these with so much passion. Park the truck, pull out a launcher and blow the ♥♥♥♥ up!!), diamond discoveries, different landscapes with unique terrain. FarCry 3 is like the hot supermodel that doesn't have all the intelligence that a normal girlfriend does: She's great to look at but the depth of conversation and the ability to draw you in are severely lacking. I have an extremely difficult time believing that the main character matured from no combat experience to wiping out an entire cartel.This was my review for FC3 but I feel it also belongs here.  I won't play FC4 and probably won't touch Primal either.  FC and FC2 were by far and away the best of the series.  What other games allow you to burn dry grasslands to draw out your enemies like the cocaine runners did in Crocodile Dundee 2?  None.  The AI is spot on in all their responses and for a game this old, they take cover really well.  Landscape was incredibly well detailed to the point you would think it's a Bethesda title and this game made you WORK for victory.  Shame on all you crybabies that ♥♥♥♥♥ed and moaned about Malaria or jamming guns or respawning guardposts.  Y'all missed the damn point of the revolutionary gameplay that made you HUNT your enemy.  I felt like a lethal predator sneaking around with my silenced handgun, silenced shotty (Anton Sigur, anyone?), and a flamethrower.I also learned that the only tool you'll need in life to fix engine, radiator and body damage is a ratchet.

												After beating Far Cry 1 I have to say Far Cry 2 followed it's own unique gameplay of endless waves of bad guys, and twist plots within the story. It's a good game. I had to have my patience while getting through the first half of the game. If you pay attention to the story line it helps you stay engaged till the ending. I believe Far Cry 2 was the, ""next gen,"" of the series allowing the player to experience an open world scenario. If you're looking for the same game play as FC1 you're going to be taken on a different path of an experience. The story is rather dark. My best advice to you is to just play through the main missions. Do your malaria missions as well. I didn't have the strength to upgrade my weapons, or do ANY side missions. I strongly suggest you just do the missions, get your malaria pills when you only have to, and bypass the enemy checkpoints as much as you can while driving on the road. The game gets better after the first 50%, literally. I promise. Here's my pros and cons.Pros: Fluid combat. Easy to aim. Intense gun fights. Decent story for a Far Cry fan, rather dark though. Game is fun if you play through only main missions and only having to do about 4-5 malaria pill runs. Missions aren't too difficult. This game is much easier than Far Cry 1. Cons: I don't like to put a bad vibe on a game I enjoyed, but there are elements of this game that will drive you nuts. First off I didn't figure out that one can do a ""quick save"" until literally half way through the game when you get to the next part of the map. If this game only ran off of the save spots that you have to physically drive to on your map this game would be horrible. The amount of A.I that you have to fight is redundant almost. Enemy checkpoints located on your map will ALWAYS re-spawn. Just drive through them. They do NOTHING towards completeting the game. There's ammo and health packets in most of these though if you really need them. The driving in this game along with following the map is a time stealer. The arrow doesn't match up with where you are on the road exactly. The GPS's in the automobiles are off as well, plus it's too small for you to follow. I had to drive with my map out 99% of the time. The story is confusing if you don't pay attention. It's also very dark if you pay attention too. That's actually a mutual feeling, but the con about the story I do have is Ubisoft could have fixed the ending just a little bit.Overall I give FC2 a positive review. It's a good single player shooter. If the shooting wasn't fluid at all and the last 30% of the game wasn't interesting enough then I wouldn't give it a review at all. I plan on playing all the Far Cry games. I'm a big fan now. If I could give just one suggestion to anyone wanting to play this older game in the series I'd tell you to have patience and get through the first half, literally the first half. You can check your progress on game completetion in the ""statistics"" category when hitting esc. It's a good game! Hope you enjoy.			"

												Just from 4 hours into the game, this is an AMAZING game.Pros:1) The guns are amazing. Yes it has the AK-47.2) The map is big from my gameplay.3) Four weapon slots: Machete, Secondary Weapon, Primary Weapon, and Special Weapon.4) You can drive and pilot a boat.5) Awesome self-healing animations, including taking the pills (for malaria) animation.6) Grenade Launcher :)7) You can burn things.8) The running animation is amazing.9) The game looks pretty, and it doesn't need a good pc/laptop to play the game.10) (cont. from 9) You can adjust the graphical settings to your liking from ""OFF or LOW"" to ""VERY HIGH and ULTRA HIGH""11) The minimap is a map you take out.12) There are a lot of the same sounds from Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 4.13) You can slide, just like in Far Cry 3 and 4.14) There are so many pros that I don't have enough patience to type them down.Cons:1) Driving a boat is horrible.2) The introduction takes like 6 minutes to shoot some god damn guns.

												Please read what I have to say. Let me hear you out, I have listened to so many complaints these years ever since I played it that I want to puke from casual complaints. I will answer you. Please read what I have to say.WHAT THE GAME IS ABOUT:You, a hired mercenary on contract for some client, hunt down a famous white african weapons dealer called the jackal, so you stop the two rivaling fronts of killing each other as he delivers weapons for both. You get paid in blood diamonds and you get deceived sometimes. The game is all about the irony of man in times of hatred and prejudice. African mercenary civilian tribal wars and the morality of weapon dealing. Deals with the death.GRAPHICS, OPTIMIZATION AND ENVIRONMENT:First, the graphics. This dunia engine was close to realistic depiction of what we all wanted in 2008. Sharp Textures, nice shadows and such. We didn´t have screen space reflection, meaning no mirror reflections, but we had ATMOPSHERE in the settings the game played in, in this case AFRICA. And we had nice weapons and animations!We also had mature themed scenarios and plots. The geometry is great for its time, only that we lack high poly counts or ambient occlusion. What we could do in FC2 though was burn stuff and let the fire consume it in a dynamic manner. Bushes and trees catched fire and spread! We could use molotov cocktails or a flamethrower to drive the enemy into a corner! Because no one used it effectively, we never ever have seen it again in a game, what a shame... With enough level design, we actually could have used it to our advantage. Sadly we never did. The jungle environment was beautiful for its time and still does even now. Never had any modern FPS, except maybe something older like Vietcong, showing such beautiful jungles and atmosphere! It simply isn´t ugly, it´s more of outdated as it lacks many modern graphics elements like advanced shaders and reflections, occlusions and lighting techniques. The game is optimized for everything from 8800GTX to GTX 480 or RADEON 2900 to 5970. It runs on any CPU with two cores and uses 4GB Ram. The game runs maxed out on my old GTX460 in 1080p on 4xMSAA with average 71 FPS. So.... everything these days probably can run it. GTX 285 run them perfectly maxed out. GTX 260 can run them maxed out non MSAA and even 8800 GTX run them on high 1080p. Even Core 2 Duo E8000´s and AMD Athlon II X2´s are perfect for such a game and max it out.WORLD, STORY AND SCENARIO:What we didn´t have was the choices! Do we still have them? Maybe.... in FC4 we can decide between two factions, one being religiously obsessed, the other hardcore stalinistic oppression through force industrilazation. In FC2 we play a simple mercenary in a money war raged country though! WE have NO choice except for deciding between mercenary friends or righteous justice. Ubisoft took a inspiration from the book Heart of Darkness from Joseph Conrad. They also looked at Lord of War from Andrew Niccol. It has you gripped with it´s realism but at the same time the characters and NPC´s are pretty far away personally and feel like puppets on a war theatre. The game never reaches to fit its role in letting you feel the worlds agonizing universe. Yet it lets you feel helpless and gives you the right impression of ♥♥♥♥ed uppery. GAMEPLAY AND BALANCING:Guns all feel balanced. They all have their purpose and none are too weak nor does the recoil make them unusable. You can decide from your very own gun houses and chambers all over the map. Which gun to equip for the next mission and which to use for your purpose. Useful and nice. Ammo is restockable and guns are buyable through a computer in the gun brokers -/ dealers shop next to your inventory houses. You can buy upgrades like stealth suits and car repair time reductions, but also a quite big arsenal of guns itself. This game has a 3 slot mechanic. Main gun, secondary and special weapon. Like Sniper rifle / assault rifle, pistol or SMG and flamethrower, explosive / LMG. Shooting guns feels amazing with great animations, recoil and details being excellent! Sadly for many there´s a jamming system with rust. If you don´t take care of your weapons, taking cover instead of charging in on enemies will be the needed way of fighting, because the guns will jam HELLA LOT. So take care of them, like a real gun nut and the game will forgive you. I will forgive you....MISSION - / LEVELDESIGN, AI AND ISSUES:The enemies flank you and shoot accurately. Stealth is possible and even sometimes easily the recommended choice. Even on brought daylight! The AI has brain and knows how not to act like a bunch of ""running against walls idiots"". They hit you quite often and quite hard and are admirable enemies. The AI is fine, except for animals, which happen to be present. Enemies are challenging on higher difficulties. Level design often goes into either scrapyards, facilities, plantages, farms, villages, depots, estates, mansions, docks and desert ruins.... it has a variety and offers you many places to fight in. Nearly everything is burnable and destroyable with decals flying all over the place!Fantastic level design! Many great routes and alternative routes besides the main routes, often you get blue instead of red alterantive routes. Morally good routes and objectives which your mercenary friends offer you to take on instead of the straight morally bad red ones. Good mission design. Many different objectives, from talking to radio DJ´s to making propaganda to execution to hostaging and blood diamond retrieval or escort, sometimes even base assault and much more. The game has you covered. You drive in buggies or quads most of the time, otherwise you take busses or boats to get to your objectives. Many who complained over long travel times never discovered the bus feature! What idiots! And there´s one big issue! The respawning enemy outposts! You can avoid them by driving past them as the map always allows you to drive around the outposts easily! IDIOTS! I SAY! IDIOTS! OMFG fc 2 was ♥♥♥♥ becauseof respawning enemies? Yes, one issue of game design! But what I did was drive around them without them pursuing me and if they did, change from the drivers seat to the MG seat and quickly kill the pursuing cars by shooting the driver and MG guys. Took me like max 10 secs! People are idiots.... Don´t be an idiot! Do it like me! This game didn´t have many issues except for that. It could get repetitive often and it had those outposts, but mostly you could avoid it. The way you die is different from other games as well. If you do missions and favors for mercenary friends, they rescue you once you died on the battlefield. They let you know if they are willing to come to your rescue. A real nice bioshock like resurrection feature. But in the end, the flow, missions and such were all nice after all if it weren´t for the issue of malaria! Yes you can get malaria... you need to do side quests for aquiring pills. You can also just let yourself get a malaria induced breakdown or stroke and have your friends save you, so you can avoid the side quests and just play for a long time until you get the stroke again.... That can be annoying. The game is still worth it though.CONTROLS:The game controls really nice and with direct mouse control, even if the menu mouse is kinda wonky. Aiming and moving is fast and accurate with no input lags and you have most common standard first person controls.ENDING AND GAME LENGTH:The game length is around 25 hrs+ with two maps and plot twists.The game offers you a nice ending with the decision to either save friends or hunt down the jackal with a nice twist at the end. Nice ending and satisfactory game length.  A fantastic game with fantastic gameplay and fantastic atmosphere ahead of its time. I wish many more would approve of it.			"

												I'm just gonna go ahead and say that FC2 is my favorite game in the series. I found Far Cry 3 to be casualized and easy. There was no challenge from start to finish and it follows the same Ubisoft open world formula from recent Assassin's Creed games. Far Cry 2 is vastly different and I prefer it over Far Cry 3 and 3.1, I mean 4 for a number of reasons. I mean just the fact I don't have to climb any radio towers to see more of the map or having the map littered with collectable icons are great. The feel and sounds of the guns are also really good for a 2008 game. Every gun in FC2 feels unique and don't feel like a toy compared to FC3 and 4. Guns jam, they have recoil, they show signs of wear and tear, and more. They don't feel like brand new military weapons but rather feel like they fit the African milita setting of the game. Every gun in FC3 and 4 feel like they're brand new and the sound is muddy when shooting them. In my opinion the gunplay in FC2 is some of the best I've played in a first person shooter, and I play quite a few of them (check my Steam game list if you want).The AI I think is pretty decent for a 2008 title. There are games released today that have far worse AI than this game. In Far Cry 3/4 if you're up on a cliff or a decent distance away and you take an enemy down via sniping then the others in the camp or nearby will always somehow zero in on your location. In FC2 the enemies will try to help their fellow comrades by carrying them to safety and search the immediate area, not instantly know which direction the shot came from like in FC3/4.As for the malaria it never really inconvenienced me when out and about, and I thought it was a pretty nice touch to the overall setting. I also don't feel it artificially prolonged the game like say having a crap ton of collectables all over the map.As for the story I'd have to sayit's not the best. In fact I enjoyed Far Cry 3's story more than FC2, but when it comes to the gameplay then FC2 for me wins easily.I give it an 8/10.PS. Don't mind the 2.6 hours on record. I played this game to death when it came out on PS3 and bought it on Steam a couple years ago on sale. "

												Too bad they dumbed down the franchise and turned them into mindless kiddie shooters with idotic story lines and level bosses . I haven't seen anything quite like this anywhere else . With all the possibilities out in the real world , keeping the mercinary theme would be great in my opinion . The malaria  slant is a little lame , but this is one of the best FPS games I have ever played . Love the open world environment . Very much more impressive than the mindless "" run & gun "" franchises out there these days . But , then , I'm not a thirteen year old kid either.			"

												There are some aspects to Farcry 2 that i actually like more than 3.The gameplay of Farcry 2 is pretty much standard like an FPS would be albeit with some addons and differences. You are able to use a primary, a secondary, and melee weapon along with a special weapon including grenades and molotovs. It is a big open world and your main means of travel is by various types of vehicles. To add a bit of realism, guns will jam and explode after awhile of prolonged use.Unlike its predecessor you can have buddies that protect you and help you on missions. You can pick which character you want to be, though it doesnt really change the outcome. Also unlike its predecessor the setting is completely different as it takes place in Africa and not on tropical islands out on the pacific ocean. While alot of people showed disdain for this setting change, i actually liked the setting and enviroment.The story of Farcry 2 is gathered via information when you accept missions or when you find cassette tapes left behind by the games main Antagonist ""The Jackal"". Essentially the lore of this game is in the background and you have to research it and pay attention to understand whats going on.Farcry 2 still holds up well in its Graphics Department for a game from 2008. The Dunia Engine makes use of fire elements burning the enviroments grass and trees, as well as showcasing a day and night cycle and weather effects not present in the previous game. As for the sound design the explosions, guns etc are all top notch while the voiceacting is pretty decent. A few music tracks caught my attention in this game; i really enjoy the calm music transition to the fast battle paced ones when a firefight is happening.My only minor gripes with Farcry 2 are having to constantly get Malaria pills, and the long drives it kinda takes to get to some areas. Other that that i recommend playing Farcry 2.			"

												The game is a misunderstood masterpiece. It is a First Person Shooter mercenary sim that is really tough but rewards you for playing stealthy,taking your time and planning how you execute your missions. It can be extremely punishing if you play it as a run and gun COD clone. Overall I found it very immersive and very challenging, particularly on infamous difficulty. The graphics are good overall , the gameplay is solid. I would recommend the game to players who are patient and like a bit of tactical planning , stealth and slower paced action.			"

												For a game made in 2008 it has aged gorgeously , The Visuals are still impressive and the game can create really intense moments . The game is set in a fictional unnamed war-torn african country which in my eyes is clearing inspired by the movie Blood Diamond and the Angolan Bush War , As a south african i was surprised that the white mercs spoke afrikaans (south african language). The guns in the game can degrade over time and visually will show the damage until it jams and eventually explode in your hands , which is a cool feature.    The game isnt like FC3 & FC4 where you are some Tourist that becomes rambo , its more plausible as you are a merc hunting down a gun dealer and the story is pretty cool , i advise you to get the game			"

												After my first review that didn't seem helpful to a lot of people and the fact that I had nothing positive to say about the game, I gave Far Cry 2 a second try. The graphics are great and the weapons and upgrades are good as well. There is plenty of action, diamonds want to be found and the map is huge. Unfortunately I still find many things that I don't like and that still annoy me a lot. First there is the car driving, this gets annoying really quickly as you constantly have to drive from one end of the map to the other and back again. It doesn't help that you cannot truly clear out road blocks, enemies will respawn even though you have cleared the camp. You can just ""scout"" these camps, thats all. This way, you will have plenty of shootouts as you often have to step out of your car and kill people before you can head on. Im also missing a fast travel system to locations you have scouted or at least to safehouses. Driving becomes a chore.Secondly there is this awful map. It is a good idea, but ultimately it is obstructing your sight and is annoying. This minimap is missing several options, you as a player should have control over. Hold the GPS in one hand and a pistol in the other for instance. Or have the map in your left hand be set on the left side of the screen and not right in the middle. Or have a GTAish GPS in your HUD. Instead you can hardly see whats in front of you. The buddy system is interesting, but ultimately lacks the immersion to bond with your partner(s), they seem expendable and are badly written.The story is bland: Kill the Jackal. I'm totally missing storyline here, that leads you through the game, tells you an actuall story. Instead the game presents you unrelated quests of killing that repeat themselves. After all you don't even know what you are actually doing and why you are in Africa. Are you there for a Malaria cure, that you got there to begin with? Are you there to befriend the Jackal? Kill Factions or not? What was the purpose of it all? Bring refugees across the border?I thought Im a mercenary, there to make a profit, well guess I lost my identity.The AI is pretty annoying as well, granted they try to surround you, but it seems even if you are hiding they always come from behind, spot you through obstacles and shoot you through high grass and plants where you could only make prediction shots.SPOILERS: But the worst of all is the miraculous ressurection of your so called buddies. First they will be killed in  the bar. Then at the end every buddy is there again in a shootout for some stupid diamonds. Even if you shoot a buddy yourself during the game, but whole clips in them, they will come back. This makes no sense at all, ""story"" or otherwise.			"

												Far Cry 2 is the sequel of the FPS Far Cry, this time set in the heat of Africa. It involves hunting down ""The Jackal"", the feared arms-dealer that fueled the war between two nations. Meanwhile, you're also constantly fighting against your contracted malaria.PROS: + Pretty long gameplay+ Good graphics despite its age and can run well on lesser devices+ Immediate freeroaming (in both areas once you reach the next)+ A good variation of satisfying-to-use guns + Lovable open nature of flora and fauna (as cheesy as that sounds)+ Raiding outposts and towns is incredibly fun+ Has a map editor which is pretty funny to fool around with+ Packed with the Fortune's Pack DLC which includes a few more weapons, alt machete, vehicles and lore+ Fair price/content ratioCONS: - The missions and various subjects (music, sounds, voice lines, etc.) are slightly repetitive- The health system and certain damage sources are a bit odd/unrealistic- The voice acting sounds like it is sped up somtimes- During my probably 200 hours on both the disk as well as the Steam version I've come across numerous small bugs like missing or invisible textures, sound malfunctions, AI glitches, odd mechanical behavior, etc.It's a little hard to explain why, but this game really feels like a masterpiece; it plays smoothly, it's fun, let's you freeroam rather quickly and feels a little realistic as well. Definitely one of the most enjoyable and memorable games I've ever played.The ""Mostly Positive"" rating on Steam is totally ludicrous. This game is a little gem.My rating: 9/10			"

												Many games try to be immersive, but Far Cry 2 really pulls it off. In this war-torn African country, you are a mercenary and everyone hates you, even the warlords who employ you. You'll need a stealthy approach, but there are no detection meters, only careful attention. You'll need to trek across a beautiful open world, but there's only a paper map to get you there. You'll need money, but the only people worth saving in this country have no money, and the mission will earn you $0 on completion. The guys who have money are first justifiable, then amoral, then despicable, but by now you're hooked, and besides, the arms dealer promised you a grenade launcher if you took out his competition.Have you ever had to watch your friend die in your arms because you weren't fast enough at clearing out an enemy guard post, or because your gun jammed in the middle of a firefight, or because you had a sudden attack of malaria, or because you set the entire complex on fire and blew up the getaway car? You will, after you play Far Cry 2. Where Spec Ops: The Line is a self-aware jab at the player for playing an FPS, Far Cry 2 takes the time to engage you first, and trusts that you will realize what a monster you've become once the missions start being things like ""The enemy can't fight if you blow up their water supply.""I described this game to an African coworker and his response was, ""Sadly, that's what happens in Africa.""

												My favorite game of all time. The most immersive and replayable game with no randomized elements, there's no skill trees or xp or leveling up. It's just you versus the enemy and you never know whats going to happen. Also one of the few stealth systems that feel realistic, enemies have very good vision. You can't move bodies or throw rocks, but this adds to the unique feel/challenge and forces you to get in and out fast. (This is my 3rd copy of the game, across 3 separate computers).			"

												This is one of the best shooters I've ever played, better than the games afterwards. The open world activities are structured in a very simplistic way, but achieving your objectives is anything but simple. You constantly feel like you're under threat of being attacked when you're outside, and you have to spend about 15 minutes preparing for each mission. Picking and replacing your weapons and maybe even getting new Malaria pills. There's a lot to contend with, you have to take cover and buy yourself time to heal yourself, you need to make sure your weapons don't jam, and you need to defend the buddies you bring with you because they absolutely can die, leaving them gone for the rest of the game. All of this means that pulling off the missions feels INCREDIBLY rewarding.Honestly I've never played a shooter as immersive as this, and yes the malria and guard post respawn issue is annoying, but not enough to break the game entirely. It's dynamic, it's dark and the world actually feels hostile to you rather than an open world playground. If you're willing to put up with its quirks, you'll find one of the most rewarding shooters of last gen here. They don't make 'em like this anymore.			"

The difference between Far Cry 2 and the others is night and day.Far Cry 3 is a decent popcorn experience which gives nothing and takes nothing.Far Cry 2 is a game with admittedly some rough edges, but the whole is greater then the sum of its parts.If you have the will to stick with it to the end, you will question the decisions you've made throughout the game; and the morality of you yourself and the people you associated with. There is no righteous cause in Far Cry 2, when everything is said and done; nobody deserves death more then the individual you choose to play. It's an interesting and immersive look into a war torn african country where there is no black and white; but shades of grey.And the game plays great too.""A living being seeks above all else to discharge its strength--life itself is will to power"" -The Jackal quoting Freidrich Nietzsche			"

												I played this years ago, and returned to it as I enjoyed it; also that I have no game time on this account.  Farcry 2 excels at making the game fun just through the gun play and traversing the land scape;  I would describe it as a gleaming example of what a game should be - as oppose as some superfluous plot with rewards dispensed through progression, Farcry 2 is fun to play at the core.Its true Farcry is not perfect, there are so many obvious bugs; but it does almost add to the game rather than mock it.  The bugs are often hilarious, i.e. there is pretty much a constant bug where you enter an area and an AI militia will levitate up into the air and suddenly drop.. As lame as it sounds, it is very funny to watch whilst scouting the place out is always amusing.I think the best thing about Farcry is the stealth and standard FPS mix.  There are many stealth games today, but not necessarily in the past, I don't think it was as frequent.  And despite the stealth component still being very primitive, I can still creep around and kill an entire group of militia with a knife without being detected (even though knife kills are often or not going to get you detected.).  It almost feels at times that the stealth element wasn't meant to be a major aspect of the game, but I think it works reasonably well.There are quite a few characters , though playing as a different character does nothing any different.  So the character system is quite superfluous which is a shame.  Though its interesting how it all pans into the story.  Story was good enough. Although it seems rather pointless and of course in line with the farcry games - overkill.  The extra stuff such as the chit- chat between the militia is good too, the game certainly has character.  It makes it worth sitting back and observing your environment. However, the Jackal tapes are a questionable introduction.  There are quite a lot to pick up, but once you pick up 5 of them, the following collected say the same thing.  Its almost like the designers were trying to make you remember those words, the hopelessness of war which I can kind of appreciate but it still sucks , they could have added more variation to it.The gun play is very good I felt. Each gun is different and for example, the sniper rifles; the more expensive one, though it is semi automatic does not make it worth forgetting the others.  The guns are nice to use and generally I felt most were worth returning to.  However, the mortar is an interesting weapon, but I have tried to master it and found it doesn't do anything... I may be wrong though, and it would be a shame a weapon like that was put in only to be bugged out -  First person shooters could do with more deviation when it comes to weapons.The game design is interesting too.  Its a case of travelling through areas, so instead of walking through a linear level and you are presented with enemies, instead, you need to get from one point on the map and need to get through check points and other obstacles which respawn.  It makes the map very re-usable and again, as the combat and the ai is as-it-is, it can make it work... I have played farcry 3 and found everything about it was an extension to this game, so logically to say it would be an improvement would be expected, however, it does not play as well as this - it is definitely more boring.  This game is probably the best in the series , or that is my opinion.			"

												In my opinion Far Cry 2 is the best game in the series. If you liked Far Cry 3/4 but found it too easy or dumbed down, you will love Far Cry 2. Lacking features such as crafting and such from the more recent games (crafting is too overrated), it gives you a gritty experience of guerrilla warfare in an African state.I'd recommend playing with Dylans Realism Modification (gives the game an extra tweak to make you plan your attacks)I'd also recommend installing Far Cry 2 Graphical Enhancement Suite (to make sunsets and the overall atmosphere look even more beautiful)The game engine is solid, the only occasional physics bugs you will encounter will be when one vehicle crashes into another, or when you walk around the safe zones and the AI  occasionally gets killed by the physics objects. This can be hillariously funny, especially when the wildlife gets involved. (It doesnt happen often enough to be something to worry about, it's only happend to me about 3 times in my entire playtime). I have never had the game crash, ever. Even with the use of Dylans mod and the Graphical ES.The gunplay is satisfying, people complain that jamming weapons are annoying, however if you purchase your own you will rarely or even never encounter this. I rather enjoy the weapon jamming as it makes the combat more exciting and unpredictable.There is also a multiplayer feature for the game which you could make use of if you want to fight some friends.With a reasonably cheap price, and occasional sales, i'd definatly recommend picking this game up.

												One of the best open world game, highly recomend, far better and less restrictive than its sequals. Love how on this one you can have a choice on who you can be and how you play, great mechanics and great missions.And for fans of philosophy, the main antagonist that seems to be some sort of Neitzchian (probably butched the real termonology) nihilist. Which also leads me to say the great amount of characters and their personalities, great number and personalities of the faction captains and commanders, as well as your buddies.Altogether a 10/10, one of my all time favorite game			"

												I got the Farcry bundle on steam sales. If you get this game, prepare to be shot at every five minutes.There are alot of missions to do and shootouts are inccredibly satisfying. Guns jam like they do in real life if they get real dirty, and things blow up, grass and trees catch on fire, etc. The only problem is that I found the map rather small for a sandbox game, but its definitely a steal especially at this price.

												This game is basically Africa Simulator 2008.You play as some faceless, generic mercenary sent to some generic African country to kill some generic arms dealer. Problem is two factions of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are fighting over all the rusted scrap metal and rocks you see throughout the landscape. You are forced to work for both factions and no one seems to notice the fact that you're working for both of them until the end of the game. Like what the ♥♥♥♥, nobody in either of the factions noticed that the guy working for them just ♥♥♥♥ed up their generic bad dude grunts for the 50th time.Also there's malaria, because some ♥♥♥♥wit in Ubisoft decided that running to the church each time you run out of your prescription pills to fight off your malaria induced seizures and doing some lame, repetitive mission was a good idea. Yeah, great job guys, real good.Your guns rust and break and ♥♥♥♥ which is pretty neat because it makes using enemy weapons a gamble because they can jam and ♥♥♥♥ you in your ♥♥♥ in a fight. Instead you buy your own weapons using some sketchy black market and some blood diamonds you find sacttered across the countryside that 12 children died trying to mine in a Congolese slave mine.The generic African country makes for a pretty dope map. There's deserts, savannas, jungles and more. Also thre's outposts. ♥♥♥♥ING OUTPOSTS. Every time you clear one the enemies just respawn. Like how many of these ♥♥♥♥ers are fighting here? How do they manage to return to each outpost 5 seconds after you just blew the ♥♥♥♥ out of it with an RPG? There's towns too but they're pretty lifeless, just more generic mercenary guys standing around.There aren't a lot of menus in the game. You press a button to bring up the map in your generic mercenary dude's hands and you actually have to look down at it. It's neat but it makes driving a ♥♥♥♥♥. There's some fast travel but only to certain points on the map for all you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who like driving 40 miles in a game just to get to the mission and die immediately to do all of that driving again. Immersion!You also have some people you meet in the game which are called buddies that can come save you when you get downed by enemies. They can actually die and when they're dead they're dead for good, which is pretty neat. They also help you out in missions with different approaches and ways to earn more Congolese slave diamonds. Once again, the buddies are all generic mercenary dudes. They try to inject some character into them but it doesn't really work out. I only liked the old Yugoslavian guy out of all of them.There are wild animals too like zebras and whatnot but they just stand around and watch all the dumb♥♥♥♥♥ fighting over nothing.Anyway its a pretty sweet game, get the Fortune Edition because you get an OP ♥♥♥ crossbow with exploding bolts which is just sick. Basically the game has everything; war, exploration, jungles, gunfights, companions, generic mercenaries, a pretty cool story once you get into it, and infectious disease. Something for everyone and definately recommended for the best Africa experience in a game yet.			"

												Far Cry 2 has nothing to do with Far Cry 1 and you can not compare them to each other because of that. Which is great. Because Far Cry 1 was a mess. It wasn't inherently bad of course. Hell, it was cutting-edge at its time! But I didn't like it too much.Nontheless, Far Cry 2 is just as hard as its predecessor. You're in Africa. You got malaria. Everyone wants to kill you. Ammo is scarce. Weapons jam frequently. Cars do, too. And I'm sure there's one bad person the dev team didn't like for every god damn guard post in this game. Oh the guard posts. Also, the AI is pretty good, especially on higher difficulties, making some fights seemingly impossible to win. Perfect for the masochistic player.One could argue that the main objective of a video game is to be fun. And you would be right. Seeing all these elements in Far Cry 2 and playing it for myself I can't say the game is always ""fun"". The game can be a frustrating, challenging and enraging piece of ♥♥♥♥ that slaps you for wanting to play with it. At times, Far Cry 2 doesn't like you nor does it want to play with you. Essentially, this game has a lot of conflict between casual video game fun and stress. But that's what makes this game a good game.It's not outstandingly great, by any means. But it's pretty solid. Although a lot of the missions come down to ""Kill this guy"", ""Blow up this thing"", ""Steal that thing"" or ""Collect 1000 of these, pretty please"". Also, you drive around. A LOT. Seriously. If there would be an african driving simulator, this would be it, I can tell you that for a fact.You could argue that Far Cry 2 can get boring at times. And it does, it certainly does. But then again, I've played MMOs so I'm up for the challenge. I don't get bored that easily. And if you don't get bored that easily like me, Far Cry 2 might just be the right game for you.You like shooting guys in the face with a variety of weapons? You like burning down vehicles, small, destructible buildings, people and gas stations? You like blowing stuff up? You like a gorgeous looking open world FPS? You don't have anything against repetitive quests and objectives? Having a constant, life-threatening condition that could strike you down at any moment doesn't bother you too much? Driving around in a car that breaks down all the time due to tons of guys shooting at it is no problem for you? If you said ""Yes!"" numerous times in the last 20 seconds, I advise you to get this game and have fun (or frustration - who cares, both words start with f so that's fair enough) with it!I like Far Cry 2 so far and if you think like me, you will like it, too. If you don't, it can't be helped. Not everyone can have a decent taste in video games. But you'll learn, I'm sure of it.			"

												Wow, talk about a game that misses the point. As an American male, I was raised on a steady diet of action movies and games that fed me exactly the sort of masculine power fantasy that I have come to expect from shooters. From classics like DooM and Duke Nukem to modern masterpieces like Medal of Honor and Call of Duty: Black Ops, games have understood that the best thing to do is inflate my ego to as big as possible by giving me complete domination over enemies and pride of place in the narrative as I, the hero, destroy all evil and save the world. These games understand that from the day I was born, I was given toy guns to play with and taught to idolize soldiers, sheriffs, pretty much anyone in a position of authority with a gun.Which is where Far Cry 2 drops the ball. I mean honestly this game fails so bad it's like it tries to be the OPPOSITE of a power fantasy. You show up in Africa and immediately get malaria. You screw up your mission, nobody cares about you, your guns jam, you have to scrounge for cash, your vehicles keep breaking down, and everyone wants to shoot you. You have to pry bullets out your ankle or pull them out of your arm with your teeth, and you have to watch buddies bleed to death unless you shoot them.Fire will spread unpredictably and burn you to death. AND YOU CAN'T CURE THE MALARIA. You can just keep popping pills, but to get the pills you have to do favors for an underground resistance run by the people stupid enough to stick around while two militias fight over the country.Instead of feeling like a badass when you kill guys, they cry out in pain, writhe around, and respawn 15 minutes later. You are a bad person, your buddies are bad people, and you get missions from bad people to do bad things. You deceive and kill people for no reason other than a potential meager profit. Nothing you do makes the world a better place and you never feel good about it or powerful when you do it.So yeah, Far Cry 2, way to miss the point that basically every other FPS game in the world has understood. Other games realize that I can't get hard without getting a sweet headshot, but Far Cry 2 just makes me feel bad about shooting people. Honestly, what's the point of a video game that doesn't make me feel good about murder? That's like watching a movie where you don't get to see any ♥♥♥♥ or explosions. Lame. Plus this game is set in Africa. Who cares about Africa? Why not set your game some place cool like a tropical island? That's what made Far Cry good. Far Cry 2 is brown and sad. Far Cry was green and blue and happy! It was like a sweet vacation where you also got to kill some dudes with some rad guns. That sounds perfect, not like the miserable slog through a hot, insect infested swamp or through a scrapyard with burning tire fires that Far Cry 2 gives you.This game is basically Blood Diamond without the feel good message at the end. Did you get to see Jennifer Connelly's ♥♥♥♥ in Blood Diamond? No. Were there explosions in Blood Diamond? A few, I guess. But still. That movie wasn't exactly as awesome as something like The Expendables. And this game is no Duke Nukem Forever.Thankfully it looks like maybe Far Cry 3 realizes where Far Cry 2 went wrong and has brought us back to the ""head to a beautiful island paradise, grab a bunch of sick weapons, and kill the ♥♥♥♥ out of some pirates to save your bros."" Now THAT is a story I can get behind! And this time instead of African resistance fighters, there's a hot native chick who helps you out, and she's not wearing much! I mean I'm not sexist but it's good if the women in a video game are easy on the eyes. I play these things for entertainment. So with its RPG mechanics (which are great because leveling up is a great way to reinforce the power fantasy) and its return to a hero I can care about instead of the horrific mercenary with zero morals that I have to play as in Far Cry 2, it looks like Far Cry 3 is the game for me.

												Far Cry 2 is an amazing sandbox type game set in Africa. You need to hunt for The Jackal, which is apparently giving guns to both sides of the factions in the war. You do missions for both sides to progress through the game. The game is divided into different Acts, which is interesting. Between the North and South of the map you will experience a loading screen, this doesn't bother me too much, because I don't go between the North and South frequently in this game. Pros:-Great graphics for an older game, still hold up well in 2014-Good story-Very realistic setting, has awesome enemy AI and your gun can jam-MASSIVE map, seriously this map is huge. I'm not sure how it is compared to other games though. -Gets on sale for very cheapCons:-Malaria, pops up alot. Pretty annoying-You'll be driving alot-Enemy outposts respawn way to frequently, if you go away from an outpost for a few minutes and come back then it will have tons of enemies in it again. Plus, these outposts are quite frequent so they can get very annoyingIn summary I highly recommend this game, it's fun, you'll get many hours out of it, and it's very cheap often. "

												firearm malfunction simulator would describe this more accurately but the authentic approach of this game regarding guns is awesome. Setting is great, missions are fun, story is kind of boring but it refers to real life events from the African civil wars so it is kinda appealing to finish the story in that sense. 9/11			"

												First and only Far Cry game I've played so far. A lot of the gameplay and shooting reminds me of Crysis 1.Pros: The shooting feels natural and sounds nice.Driving feels natural and there's lots of variation. Pretty realistic, if your engine gets shot and starts smoking you'll slow down a lot. Bullets can shoot holes in windshields, etc.I personally haven't had any crashes or bugs so far.The open world is large and isn't too cluttered or too sparse.Cons:Pathing is a bit clunky. Don't expect to squeeze between tight spaces in gunfights or bunny hop up cliffs like in Skyrim.Punkbuster hung up while isntalling from Steam and would never finish. If you don't plan on playing online you can go to your steam install folder and find the install and delete it so it never installs.Alt-Tabbing resizes both the game and other windows. When you go back in the game pressing Alt+Enter resizes it back to fullscreen without any other problems.			"

												Far Cry 2 is my favourite title in the series. It will probably be yours if you like your games challenging and frustrating, but at the same time fulfilling to complete. The plot differs from other FC games; rather than embodying some variety of quirky evil, your nemesis - The Jackal - is shrouded in ambiguity. He sells guns to all sides, and so he must die...however, is it as simple as that?The AI isn't anything special, yet battles are made fun or even thrilling as you are handicapped by several abiding traits:- Malaria - this impairs your vision, ability to sprint or even walk, and total health.- Weapons jamming; this is painfully common in the heat of battle.- Vehicles are easily made immobile, making hit and run style attacks tough to pull off.- The environment of heavy foilage, dull browns and greens means enemies are easily camouflaged.- Health recovery is slow, to the point where fleeing is more viable than taking cover, which also tends to be difficult.Even patched, the game suffers from a few glitches, including one where a side mission failed to start, requiring me to load an earlier file. Navigating, with your handheld map, can be cumbersome. But these shortfalls are forgivable, for Far Cry 2 is punishingly hard, has atmosphere, benefits from a decent story, and makes diamond hunting near-compulsory in service of you getting reasonably equipped; for even more of a challenge, don't hunt or spend them.The visuals, while dated, remain passable several years after its release in Autumn 2008. The tropical forests and plains of sub-Saharan Africa have since been used by popular series such as Metal Gear Solid, but remain generally unfamiliar to gamers. The murky politics and many conflicts of the region make it nothing less than perfect for a Far Cry game, and make the story more believable and immersive.Far Cry 2 is superb, but only if you're the kind of gamer who relishes challenge, and doesn't want his hand held or need his eyes dazzled by cutting edge graphics.

												This game is one of the best games I have played. This game gets some negative feedback because of its difficulty, but I will explain why you should play it.First off, Far Cry 2 still looks absolutely gorgeous. Africa has never looked better in a game. You will find zebras and gazelles roaming the grasses. You will enjoy mountains, waterfalls, and canyons, travel across the small lakes, visit Pala, Sefapane, and Mosate Selao, and speed across the dirt roads to hunt for enemies.  The gunplay in Far Cry 2 is undoubtedly realistic. This is no Call of Duty; your guns behave like real ones and there is not much ""running and gunning"" unless you are playing on easy.  There is gun jamming and degradation, so you will need to take care of them. There are weapons for everyone. There are multiple rocket launchers, grenade launchers, pistols, machine pistols, snipers, and explosives. There is even a dart rifle and a explosive crossbow!The missions are fun but may get boring. I would advise playing on Hardcore or Infamous difficulties because when you play on them, the game becomes much more challenging and even more realistic. There are respawning outposts with enemies, and these provide good fun since you never run out of people that are trying to kill you. Many people are not used to such a harsh game; expect everybody outside of the Ceasefire zones to try to kill you. Is that good? Your call.There are tons of weapon upgrades and some vehicle upgrades, plus upgrades that will allow you to carry more ammunition or molotovs. The second half of the world unlocks when you complete half the missions in the game, and this second world adds new Jeeps, boats, and guns, plus new locations to explore.Fire is my favorite part of the game because it is so well-done. The fire is better than Far Cry 3 because it was not designed to play a large role in Far Cry 3. Far Cry 2 has seasons and rain, so expect fire to work less effectively when the grass is green or there is a downpour. When the grass is dry and there is no rain, fire becomes the game changer. If I feel overwhelmed during gameplay, I may throw a molotov cocktail into some dry grass to start a (potentially massive) fire. This fire scatters enemies, forcing them to change their attack plan; if you are lucky, you may even get one to burn to death. The audio in this game also never ceases to impress me. You can hear birds and monkeys in the trees, the wind rustling the leaves, the whine of the mounted gun as it swivels. When you are around enemies, you will hear their conversations (they sound believable). The music in this game is a nice change as it is what you would expect and African band to play. You have malaria during the game, and it puts an interesting spin on your gameplay. You may have to wait out a malaria occurence, and this can kill you. The best tactic to do is throw a molotov and hurry to cover.Note that it took me 30 hours to complete my first playthrough. After that, you can do a new one on a harder difficulty (feel free to change difficulty anytime you want). The ending of the game is unexpectedly deep. All in all, this is a game like no other. Everything I said above amount to an amazing experience. This is an experience like no other that can be had, during a sale, for just $2.50. "

												The best Colonization simulator i've ever played..You play a brave, noble soldier in Her Majesty's Colonial Forces and you must kill all the dirt worshipping Hutus and Tutsis you see for honor and glory! Once you kill enough dark-skinned savages, you can then build up an civilisation that they were too stupid to put together. Once you have an operating civilisation, you can then fire into large crowds of protestors who feel ""oppressed"".All in all, this game gets 9/10 Rule Britannias for its authenticity and genocidal fun!

												For game that came out in 2008 this is realy awesome looking game. It have some glitches/raw moments especialy with mouse sensetivity and video/display settings... so you got to get used to it due time. Whole gameplay reminded me a bit a movie Blood Diamond with Leonardo DiCaprio... the atmosphere here is kinda the same. This game is Part/Open World shooter with some minor survival elements. Playing this game on Hardcore difficulty making it pretty challenging. Comparing to other shooters of that time in this game is a bit hard to aim and shoot and everything is very situational. And its different type/genre to FarCry 1. Basicly its one of 1st of very few open world shooters that came out on PC. CryEngine (aka Dunia) here looks realy beautiful (for 2008 ofc). Cant say that i'm pleased with storyline but also cant say that i dont like it... maybe just i wanted it to go a bit different way. I was playing this game for few months 1-2 hours per day and now when im looking at Steam and see that i've finished it to the ending for just 55 hours ... im kinda surprised... to me it seems like i was playing it for at least half of a year and spent much ... much more time. Also i realy like that idea of healing self by talikg out bullets and other stuff from your body pieces ... every time i was watching this i got my teeth tight creaking ))). 10/10 for this crap.So: Sound/Voice/Music - 9/10. Graphics/Visuals - 9/10. Story LIne - 7/10. Gameplay - 8/10I would reccomend this game to everyone who like non-linear 1st person shooters with some minor survival style things and constantly have some free few hours for gaming.-W-			"

												Pros:+Good variety of very different weapons, and they are all fun to use.+Beautiful graphics+Great deal of freedom when doing missions and freedom to do things when you want to do them.+Gun degradding, wound healing, and no pausing to look at a map add to the immersion.+Always plenty of guys to shoot and generally good AICons:- GENERALLY good AI. On harder difficulties, they can see through vegetation unusally well, but not consistently. They're also bullet sponges if you don't use explosives, shotguns, and sniper rifles. Sometimes they are smart and try to flank you, other times they bum rush you like it's their first time playing a shooter.- Voice acting is very odd; it feels rushed. Considering what kind of game this is trying to be though, this isn't a big deal because...- ... the plot is more of an excuse to be shooting people in Africa than an actual story.- Driving to objectives is a 'female dog' (thanks for the PG censorship on an M rated game, Valve) and a half with all the patrols and guard posts that respawn if you walk more than 100m away. I opt to go on foot most of the time becuase, aside from discovering more that way anyway, it's safer.Objective score: 8/10It's a tremendous amount of fun to feel like a hunter and methodically approach every conflict, but you don't have to always be stealthy. Constatnly changing up your play style is what makes this game so much fun. It's my go-to game if I just want to relax after a hard day. I like to take my time, slowly pick guys off one by one with the dart rifle, then finish off any remaining bad dudes with a shotgun. But again, I switch it up often. Silly ways to have fun:+ The flare gun is a one hit kill and magically kills everyone in a car, even though it doesn't set the car on fire nor directly hit anyone inside. +The AS50 can shoot through more than one person.+ Sneak up behind an enemy, place an ied, back up, *boom*.+ I never get tired of sniping guys in boats. They fly out sideways about 5-7 feet in a perfectly straight line.Subjective score: 10/10 - Would bless the rains down in Africa again... but fire spreads more easily when it's dry.Sorry I got that song is stuck in your head now :)			"

												Far Cry 2 is one of the best open world games out there. Set in a war-torn African country, there's a wide variety of places to see: from deserts, to deep jungles, small towns...The story is pretty good. You arrive at this country in order to kill the Jackal, the guy who armed both sides of the conflict. Things go wrong, and you end up taking jobs from the different factions in order to gain their trust, and, in exchange, getting information about your target. Luckily, you're not alone in this mission; although the troops will shoot you on sight even if you're working for them, you'll still come across several buddies (foreigners, just like you) who will help you out during missions.There's plenty of stuff to do in this game. Besides the main missions, there are different missions you can take, including taking convoys transporting weapons, assassinating certain targets, and helping your buddies out. Also, you'll encounter enemy outposts, and, although taking them out is fun, they respawn quickly, which gets tiring after some time, and you'll end up trying to use fast travel (which, by the way, is only available at certain locations, in the form of bus stops) as much as you can to avoid the outposts.The environment, as mentioned, is quite varied, and the map is huge. You can move around it using different vehicles, including jeeps, trucks, quads, boats, to name a few. You can unlock safehouses on the different areas, and there's hidden stuff to look for.Another interesting mechanic is the sickness level: your character is infected with malaria, and there's nothing you can do to cure it, you can only take pills in order to control it. While it's an annoyance most of the time (especially if you have a malaria attack right in the middle of a firefight), it's still an interesting mechanic. There's also weapon degradation, meaning that you'll need to get new weapons from time to time, or run the risk of a weapon jamming at the wrong time. Luckily, weapons bought at stores are always available at armouries next to them.Well, in conclusion, this is a really good game, one you should really play.			"

												Like Far Cry 3, but slightly less streamlined, less quest / notification markers and (in my opinion) a far nicer and bigger map.Honestly I did prefer FC3 when it came out, but after re playing it, I absolutely love the freedom you get with FC2, you're not CONSTANTLY nagged by the game to do the next mission with a ♥♥♥♥ing obnoxious phonecall every time you die / load a game. You just pick and chose what you want to do at your own pace and I love that. Plus all the little secrets, hidden diamonds have you spending hours trying to figure out how to get up a cliff, take special routes. Its great. It has its flaws, for a start the muddy graphical filter and occasionally bizarre AI.. But 2 mods easily fix that. Check MODDB - Dylans mod and SWEETFX. I've been replaying this for the past 7hrs, so underrated.			"

												Great game even though its 2016. I already owned this game for a couple of years but never completed it for various reasons. I've played Far Cry 1 + Far Cry 3, so I've got some experience with the Far Cry franchise.I did not play this game vanilla, I installed these compatible mods from the beginning and I can recommend you to do the same:- Dylan's Far Cry 2 Realism Mod.- Real Africa - The Ultimate SweetFX Config ( Best graphics mod, trust me).- Night Vision Mod for Far Cry 2 by Masson.First of all, what immediately striked me when playing this game was the nature. From the way the wind was blowing trough the grass and trees, the birds and other animals making their pressence known. It just felt alive and breathing.The transition from day to night, the different weather types, every little details adds up to something really beautiful. TIA, from Blood Diamonds, one of my favorite movies, comes to mind.I haven't finished the game yet, but I can already tell the story is realistic but not really fascinating to me.The villain in this story is intriguing, but Vaas was way more badass. Then again, wich game villain was ever more badass then Vaas? I like the buddy system, it adds another layer to the game. Especialy because they can die.Obviously if you quick save allot then you can prevent this, but I like to play hardcore and only safe in safehouses.If they die on missions, they die. Brutal, but this game ain't about fairy tales, such is life.I already mentioned the nature and sounds, combined with the mods, the atmosphere in this game is absolutely perfect. When you are shooting african warlords or south african mercenaries, you get a sense of the cold (or should I say warm) hard reality of Africa. There is no higher moral ground whatsoever, you are in it for the money/diamonds, altough at times you are portrayed as the Good Bad Guy doing some of the dirty work that must be done for the good guys.Something I don't like in this game are the limited amount of vehicles and there is a weird invisible speed limiter at 70/110 (kmh), depending on the vehicle. I know it's africa and they don't drive Lambo's, but I feel this aspect could have been done better. Then again, this game was published in 2008 so I can definitely forget this flaw.The four weapon slots one weapon each are a bit anoying. But for gameplay purposes I can understand why they have done this and it fits the grim realistic setting of this game.The weapon jamming of rusty old weapons you got from killed enemies can be a big liabilty in battle. A grenade-launcher jamming in the middle of the battle with two nearby shirtless wild african UFLL soldiers screaming for your blood, can be a little daunting to put it mildly. The reloading and unjamming animations are awesome and rewarding. At times it makes you want to play with unreliable rusty weapons, just for the thrill and risk of having to take cover in battle and unjamming your weapon as a badass, maybe opting for your machete when the enemy gets close. Russian roulette at its best.The navigation map was very frustrating for me in the beginning, but I've gotten used to it. I still prefer a radar in the corner of my screen, but it's playable and again fits the setting of this game.There are some animals in this game, but they could have added more variety, like hyena's, rhino's, flamengo's et cetera.  All and all, I've already taken way too many screenshots of this game and I'm going to enjoy finishing it.So far this is my favorite Far Cry and I think it's way too underrated. I wouldn't say this game feels old, to me it feels more like a 2012/2013 game.I hope there will be another Far Cry in the future with this setting, because it's one of the best. I give this game a 9 out of 10.			"

												If you are looking for a great open-world first-person shooter, than you should take a look at Far Cry 2 in a Steam summer sale. This game has nothing to do with the first Far Cry game because it is a completely different world and setting. StoryMain story: The player takes control of a mercenary on a lengthy journey to locate and assassinate ""The Jackal"", a notorious gun runner. He is the one who is selling weapons to the people and the main reason for the escalation in Africa. To find him you must take missions from two factions during a civil war: the APR and the UFRR.  “The jackal” will finding you, so you have to be like him to gain his attention.GameplayThis game takes place in Africa and has a very big area with 50 square kilometers and many different terrain like deserts, savannas and jungles. There is a dynamic weather system that has a day-night cycle and different weather conditions such as storms and strong winds. The time of day also affects the behavior of AI, in terms of enemy alertness and aggressiveness. To travel through the game you can use many vehicles including cars, trucks, quads and boats or you go by foot.To defeat your enemies you have access to a large arsenal of weapons. Assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, machine guns, explosives and a flamethrower. You have four weapon slots but only three can be chosen, because the first slot is always a machete for melee attacks. You can use hand grenades and Molotov cocktails too. Weapons can become dirty and prone to jamming if you use them to much, so you should change them from time to time.The realism in Far Cry 2 is very nice. Apart from the weather and the weapon degradation, the player needs to hold a physical map and a handheld navigation system to get around, no minimap in this game. The greatest feature is the fire. For Example, a small fire can become very large in an area like a savanna with strong wind. You are able to burn complete outposts with one Molotov.If you are not on a main mission you can collect diamonds to buy better gear, take save houses and spy outposts or kill all the enemies in there. Or you take side missions to get more diamonds and take special missions for antimalarial drugs.You can use many different play styles. Being like Rambo and use LMG’s, shotguns and a flamethrower or being like a ghost with a sniper rifle and kill them silently? Your choice. A negative point is, that the enemies respawn to fast. If you cleared an outpost and turn around after you drove 50 meters, they are back. That’s annoying. GraphicsFar Cry 2 was released in 2008 and looked very beautiful. In 2016 it is still looking very awesome and runs perfectly on newer systems. The Dunia Engine has the best vegetation I’ve ever seen, very realistic and nice. Lights and shadows are also very nice, only the nights are too bright and in 2016 the rain looks a little bit unrealistic if there is no sun, but 90% of the time your eyes will enjoy it. [Outdated]Far Cry 2 includes multiplayer and an awesome map-editor to create your own maps for the multiplayer with strict rules, that the map is balanced at the end. You can create realistic maps, recreate maps from other games [de_dust2] or just build funny maps like a race map. This is the easiest map-editor and I created a lot maps in 2008. The multiplayer was funny but today I think, no one is still playing that. Far Cry 2 is a great Ego-Shooter with a large open-world, a realistic and beautiful setting with a weak story bur strong gameplay elements. Most of the time you are a lonely wolf in a big and beautiful world and anyone is your enemy. It is an open-world adventure more like a sandbox game as a theme park title. This is not an action-title like Far Cry 3 or far Cry 4, so if you want that, then don’t buy it. If you loving large open world games and playing with different play styles, go and buy it on sale for less than $5,00. It’s absolutely worth it.			"

												Probably one of the most thematically difficult games to experience due to the graphic potrayal of real-world issues: conflict diamonds, arms races, disease-attrition (malaria), internally displaced persons/refugees, and ideologically-fueled factions fighting for control over scraps of impoverished landscape. Unlike it's sequel, FarCry 3, this game feels less cartoony and emotionally vapid because it keeps the player vulnerable, evenly equiped with enemies, and isolated in the vastness of the maps. This can be frustrating at times, but ultimately (I argue) makes for a more valuable experience. Your mortality is quickly equated with that of the world's other NPCs and inhabitants, and so the destruction, or implied destruction, of those lives is more profound.While FarCry 3 represents a huge step forward in gaming technology and is a worthwhile experience in it's own right, it's emotional impact and themes fell flat for me because of how the game held your hand throughout and superpowered the player very quickly with outrageous rewards for menial tasks. I played FarCry 2 after finishing the third game, and felt a much deep connection to the aesthetics of this one. Although I think it's fair to say that the plot is almost non-existant, and certainly not a coherent narrative than a series of similaraly motif-ed scenes joined by some key characters and locals; the plot only really comes together toward the end of each ""chapter"" when the principle antagonists are reintroduced to the game after remaining shadowy figures, alluded to but not seen or felt. Overall, a fastastic game with some flaws, but one that has given me more pause to consider the real world than anything else I have ever played.			"

												It’s a great African driving simulator. But really…I had high hopes for Far Cry 2. I saw the great reviews it got. But only 5 hours into it I had to stop playing. It was a combination of complete boredom, frustration and knowing I’ve already experienced all the game would have to offer.Far Cry 2 is a very open world game. After the first guided mission you are free to go wherever you want, which is nice. Except…Here is the formula for every Far Cry 2 mission I encountered in 5 hours     +Drive to a place that has a mission available     +Drive to the waypoint on your map for that mission. Which is always far away.     +Get shot at driving through areas you’ve already cleared.     +Repair your vehicle.     +Take down a random vehicle with a turret.     +Repair your vehicle.     +Complete mission.That’s it…that’s how it was for 5 hours before I knew that was all the game had to offer and show me.I might have been able to push through if the missions were close to one another. But, there’s SO much driving in this game. I didn’t mind that in itself. The fact that it’s not even enjoyable really killed it for me. I thought after clearing a checkpoint it would be good from then on out…WRONG. Enemies always respawn everywhere. Which means you get in constant battles when you just want to drive through an area you already cleared. It makes me feel like I’m not accomplishing anything and gives me no incentive to kill enemies. I just resorted to flying through the checkpoints and killing any vehicles that gave chase to me. Far Cry 2, in my opinion, commits several cardinal sins in video games.      +Respawning enemies     +Enemies that can hit you from a mile away, consistently. Even with a shotgun?!     +Enemies that can instantly hit you each time you break from cover     +Enemies that know your exact locationPros+Open world style of gameplay+Graphics+Good shooter at its core+Capturing the African environment and culture+MusicCons+Respawning enemies+Extremely repetitive gameplay+Too much driving around+Enemy AI+Didn't feel rewarded for doing anything+Strange run on sentences with the voice acting4/10 Below averageFar Cry 2 really does have some good mechanics and systems it employs. But the negative things I mentioned above far outweigh the positives. I couldn’t continue playing and therefore can only recommend if it’s on a big sale and you’re really curious. Otherwise, stay away.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Far Cry® 2: Fortune's Edition Original Release: 2008 Genre Tags: FPS; Action; Open World;   My Overall Grade: B Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 12-25 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Auxiliary Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Strong narrative advocates; Fans of the intellectual property; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs REVIEWMany people were disappointed in Far Cry 2, and it does have its flaws, but I still found it to be an enjoyable experience overall.  The game succeeds in being immersive and captivating, and the actual gameplay is exciting and has some novel mechanics. Also, there is an interesting story aspect imbedded in the main campaign. These qualities can help some people overlook the minor annoyances; others however may feel like it’s not worth putting up with them, especially if they aren't as interested in the narrative and atmospheric aspects.I felt that the environments were well-designed and the gameworld was a pleasure to explore. The graphics are pretty solid, and the animations and effects are noticeably good.    Far Cry 2 definitely has a nice setting.  If you enjoy immersing yourself in foreign gameworlds, you should like this.The gameplay is also pretty fun overall. There are a lot of good ideas and unique nuances in the game. Also, the combat can be exciting and the open-world allows you to plan your route of attack any way you would like.  There are some annoying aspects to the gameplay, though.  But there are some pretty awesome missions sprinkled throughout the game that make putting up with the annoying parts worth it.As for those annoying parts, there are two main aspects of the gameplay that can become tedious at times. For one: the gun jamming. The idea of implementing mechanics where guns found on the ground have little ammo and jam frequently sounds interesting on paper, but it needs to be executed well. In Far Cry 2, there are times it winds up being far more annoying than interesting. And the other main gripe with the game is the extremely frequently respawning guard posts.  Clearing 5 guard posts every time you want to travel on the map gets old fast. But both of these annoyances can be extensively minimized by just playing on easy.  Guns will jam far less often, and you will able to drive right through the guard posts instead of clearing them out every time. So I suggest you don’t play this particular game on a high difficulty.  You will only magnify the aforementioned faults with the game and allow them to overshadow the fun parts. And as I mentioned, there are some really fun missions in the campaign.So if you would be interested in this kind of game, and feel like you would be able to enjoy the good parts, then Far Cry 2 should be something you consider checking out.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												As much as I want to recommend this game, I can't. There are just too many immersion and game breaking bugs that will never be fixed.I'll admit, I did have fun for a while. Sneaking into a heavily guarded fort on a rainy night, killing the target and sneaking back out after only killing one guard with just a knife felt pretty awesome. But there are just so many annoying factors for the majority of the game, and let me start off with the two biggest issues:THERE ARE PROGRESSION BLOCKING/SAVE CORRUPTING BUGS THAT FORCE YOU TO RELOAD AN EARLIER SAVE.And you have no idea when they occurred. I had this happen to me twice in one playthrough, but luckily I had many save files to fall back on and find the ones that still worked, which set me back 4 hours. I almost rage quit and I wouldn't blame anyone for doing so. Having that many save files is also annoying because it takes forever to open the load menu because each save is ~5MB. I'm not completely sure, but I noticed that when the door guards tell you to go look for a guy in captivity, your game is about to break. Look at the map to see where the buddy is, then reload a save that was before you talked to the guard and go find them on your own. I have heard of other bugs like key NPCs vanishing or just refusing to talk to you, but I did not personally experience them.THERE IS A BUG THAT ONLY LETS YOU LISTEN TO 11/18 JACKAL TAPES.Jackal tapes are the ramblings of the arms dealer you are sent to kill. The Jackal is the main villain. These tapes are the only way you can get inside his head and see why he behaves the way he does...and you can't get them all in the current state of the game. This is a pretty big part of the story that just goes missing, especially because those last few tapes reveal a lot about the character (because the majority of the game doesn't tell you anything story related). How do I know that? Because I looked them up on YouTube, the only way to listen to them all now.The game crashes constantly with DX10.Use DX9.Enemies and supplies respawn after they go out of draw distance.Go too far away and come back, and they'll all be there again. Not only is this annoying when you're trying to get somewhere that involves backtracking, but it makes you feel like nothing you do matters. It just wastes your time.Enemies know exactly where you are the instant you miss.Good luck trying to take out a base without save-scumming. The instant you miss one bullet, they all know your exact location and start closing in and shooting even if you used a silent weapon like the dart gun. This is a glaring flaw because you have to plan your attacks on every set of enemies. They can very quickly overwhelm, flank, and kill you on higher difficulties so you must try to take out as many as possible from range. Don't even think about turning down the difficulty, because...Enemies are stupid.Even if you crank the difficulty up, which gives the AI the ability to flank you and such, they'll still do some really dumb stuff. I once blew up a barrel from a distance and the AI decided the best way to investigate the situation was to gather around it. About 6 guys just grouped up and I shot them one at a time. They never took cover, just spun around looking for me. On easier difficulties they'll ""run"" up to you, stare at you for a few seconds, then fire. They seem to have overreacted to far cry 1 difficulty complaints.Cell tower and arms dealer side missions are always the same.There is absolutely no variety in any of these. The cell towers have you assassinate one guy always dressed in a suit with a desert eagle in random heavily guarded areas. Sometimes he's in a car. Sometimes he's in a cease-fire zone. The arms dealer missions are EXACTLY the same: it's always blow up a truck with a technical in front and behind it driving in a convoluted circle on one of the 9 map squares. Always. There is no creativity whatsoever, and it's pure padding.Most of your time will be spent driving.Almost every mission will have you travel across the whole map repeatedly, and because of respawning enemy camps this can take forever. Good luck driving through an outpost because the AI will get in their cars, cheat by going faster than you can to catch up to you, and blast you away. The only time you can ""drive"" past an outpost is when you go full speed in a swamp boat, the AI doesn't seem to notice/catch up in those cases. There are 5 ""fast"" travel points across the 9 map squares in an X shape, but that's not enough and normally you still have to do a good bit of driving to and from them. Driving in-and-of-itself is annoying as well because...Vehicles have horrible behavior.They struggle to go over the smallest of obstacles and handle like arcade racers. If you manage to get your vehicle stuck on a 6 inch flat rock or in a dried up river bed while it's upright you can't push it off, you just have to abandon it. But if you drive your open top vehicle off a 50 foot cliff and it ends up sideways or upside down after bouncing around a few times (not damaging your health at all) you can just go to one side and spam the use key to flip it upright. All of this is very immersion breaking.The vehicle repair animation is stupid.I realize you can't expect them to put in a completely realistic fixing animation where you rebuild the engine or something, but at least have some variety. All you do is put a socket wrench on one nut and twist it for a few seconds. That's it. For every vehicle. If you get a repair manual, you twist faster, but only for that specific vehicle that the repair manual was for. Apparently buggies, ATV's, trucks, technicals, and even Jeep(TM)(R)(C)'s all have a magical nut that will instantly repair a vehicle to factory conditions when twisted. Who knew?There are no civilians outside.There is no friendly/neutral AI except the almost stationary buddies. This situation only makes sense at the very end of the game due to the story, but for practically the entire time there is no reason for it. Every single person outside is armed and dangerous. Every story mission you are an under cover operative and both sides will shoot you on sight unless you are in a cease-fire zone.There are infinitely spawning mobs and clairvoyant AI in Cease-fire zones.If you shoot anybody in a cease-fire zone, every single AI in that zone will (1) know your exact location and (2) infinitely respawn as hostile until you leave the zone and run a bit further, then you can immediately come back and they won't care. This hostile behavior happens even if nobody saw you take the shot with a silent weapon. Very immersion breaking.Weapon durability only applies to you.I get why durability is in the game, it makes sense to have a weapon degrade over time. An enemy's weapon never jams when he wields them. However, the instant he dies his weapon becomes utter ♥♥♥♥ and will jam like crazy until it explodes in your hands three reloads later. Some of the weapon design/behavior is horrible.The two that stand out the most to me are the MGL (that revolver like grenade launcher) and the dart gun. Now I don't know too much about guns, but I do know that the MGL (1) Has 6 grenade slots and (2) reloads like a revolver. It doesn't have 4 grenade slots in a magazine style reload system. This reload animation is just insulting. As for the dart gun, apparently it's hard to carry more than 10 darts the size of bullets. What is the point of having a silenced sniper rifle if you can only use it 10 times before you need to find ammo. Not to mention the gun has the worst reliability and on easy can break before you even run out of ammo. Wut?!I'd go on but I'm out of space. DON'T BUY THIS GAME! "

												Far Cry 2 is one of the best shooters of all time. Like any good story, it's loosely inspired by Heart of Darkness. And believe you me, the story, barebones as it might seem (no traditional cutscene until the very very end), is shocking and incredible. Trust no one, shoot everything that moves, you will be friendlier with your ingame buddies than your real life ones, all that good vidyagamey stuff.Far Cry 2 avoids many of the flaws of its successor - a game I would best describe as Robinson Crusoe for somebody who wants a power trip. Not knocking its many successes (the animal system, etc), but many RPGs make the mistake of letting the player get away with pretty much anything in the lategame. Far Cry 2 is not an RPG. You will make decisions, but you're not in search of XP: you're in search of a better chance at survival, and if you're feeling lucky, maybe you'll try to keep your buddies alive too.Far Cry 2 is an experience.I chose to disable the crosshair because muh immersion (note the presence of ironsights makes that decision slightly less punishing compared to, say half-life) and I highly recommend you do the same as well, because this game, despite having questionable graphics from the mid-2000s, works best when you're immersed and twitchy and prepared mentally for the worst.Far Cry 2 gives you nothing. You have to earn every buddy, hoard every high quality weapon you own, build your reputation with the factions brick by brick. Regardless of your choice of APR or UFLL - pick your own lesser of two evils - your greatest enemy is the jungle itself. Your guns will jam and even break (usually when you need them most), the harsh terrain and many, many faction guard posts means that even a trip between two safehouses a mile apart must be planned and taken with the utmost caution, and don't even get me started on malaria. If you play Far Cry 2, prepare to be challenged.Far Cry 2 is a first person shooter that does not encourage combat. Even one soldier is a very valid threat of death. You do have a safety net in the form of your buddies, but don't rely on it. It's almost always better to detour around or sneak past a guard post than to plow through it. Stealth is encouraged but not rewarded - you can stealth kill, but guards will almost always scream out upon death, meaning that a kill threatens you more than helps you. Even carrying a sniper rifle at all times (highly recommended) and engaging from a great distance carries great risk, from multiple guards jumping in jeep and running and gunning you down, or mortar strikes, or a random patrol invalidating 90% of your hard work. Recommendation? Be ready to move, always keep your health high, and your life is worth more than anything else, even (especially?) the mission.Far Cry 2 will not leave you in the same place you began it. Many (most?) video games place you as the most important person in the world and give you all the tools to your success. This is not a power fantasy. This isn't even an underdog fantasy. This is hard work, and any reward will be in your head alone. You will be beaten down and beaten up, but if you beat the game, you will genuinely feel accomplishment and success unlike any game out there.			"

												Best game in the series. Far Cry 2 takes itself seriously, presenting the experience of being a mercenary fighting in the middle of a nameless African nation's civil war as a grim affair. Unlike the later games which glorify violence, Far Cry 2's tone is one of a much more mature nature.It's still a game about being a morally grey character in a morally grey war, but it does it in about the most tasteful way it can be done.I highly recommend using Dylan's FC2 mod as well, as it tightens up the gameplay and addresses the game's wonky AI checkpoints.

												In my opinion, the best game in the Far Cry series.  Yes, your character has malaria, and yes, your guns will break if you go too long without replacing them.  And yes, fast travel is incredibly limited, forcing you to drive around through the same checkpoints of infinitely respawning guards over and over again.Still, I recommend you give it a try.  It's one of the most immersive and wildly unpredictable FPSs I've played.  And hey, I'll take those infinitely respawning guards over the guards in Far Cry 3 that completely disappear forever once you clear an outpost.  At least in this game I can always find somebody to shoot.			"

												If you're the type who plays Far Cry for the map editor like me, then Far Cry 2 is by far the best. Unlike the later games, Far cry 3 and 4, Far Cry 2 offers unlimited map editor possibilities. You can do almost anything you please just as long as it's within the maps limitations. I've seen maps players created that were replicas of Grove street from GTA: San Andreas, The Deathstar from starwars and Megaton from Fallout 3. Not to mention, the story is also really good. It's a little short compared to the others however. Ubisoft butchered the map editor to the ground in the later games. The limitations were so great that I lost interest in the games. Far Cry 3 has an amazing story, I give it that, but the story wasn't all that the players loved about the game. Unfortunately, Ubisoft didn't understand that as some of you know.			"

												""I was hoping to get some BBQ and some cold icy beers at Mike's Bar...and after maybe some buffet at the weapons store to load up on some lead and explosives."" This was the thought that ran in my head as I play Far Cry 2.  In some ways as I relate to the story, I felt sorry for the world particularly with imagery thoughts on all the refugees and children homeless and sickness as the game starts, BUT unfortunately it didn't do a really good job in showing just how serious and bad the world has become.  It seems like you yourself is suffering from Malaria while all the NPCs and people you meet not one is suffering from malaria.  Also there are no refugees wondering about or getting shot at or threatened by mercenaries, no brutal executions or things that people see in wars on TV in the game.    The game is great and it plays well, BUT its too quiet...in between missions and fighting against enemy guard posts or driving around the land, there's nothing else except looking for diamonds. The control mechanisms are well done and the weapons really are AWESOME.  Especially the weapons degradation JAMMING! During gun fights I was always forced to swap from my assault rifle to my weak ♥♥♥ Makarov pistol as my rifle jammed in the middle of run and gun, and I became desperately looking for a stronger weapon....and there it was, an assault Jeep! GET ON THE GUN!   It was great because it was in these moments where you were put to make snap decisions, you run? or your going to fight them with a pistol?  OH and the Malaria kicks in just in time...with enemies come after you with full firepower...Run ♥♥♥♥♥ Run!   But no worries, when you ran out of health and knowing your going to die, your buddy shows up! Shooting down enemies as he drags away saving your ♥♥♥, I'm pumped to get up again and ♥♥♥♥ some ♥♥♥♥ up once more!  However, later in the game you realize, your buddy...Is he or she really your buddy!?   It's really easy to relate and immerse into the game because the world is so familiar we may have seen it in war movies and how refugees are migrating and escaping from wars etc...I just hope that it could've have done just a little bit more with putting in interactive NPCs like helping some refugee families, rescuing civilians from oppression by random mercenaries, and then you can earn your own reputation by your deeds which could effect how the story of the game could see you as good or bad.   I really do hope that Ubisoft can remake the game...however that is impossible..because I'm sure that if they remake this game again, it'll be great with all the new stuff added like NPCs and the total expansion that gives a more feel to what war torn Africa is like, would be another added treat along with titles like Far Cry 3 or Far Cry 4.

												Far Cry 2 is an open world FPS where you play as a merc hunting down ""The Jackal""; a notorious arms dealer that has armed two warring factions (APR and UFLL) in an Unnamed African Country (UAC).In terms of gameplay, you will spend most of your time doing the following: -Driving through the jungle, savannah, desert, and rural town settings of the UAC. -Shooting, exploding, burning, or sniping your way through hostile outposts, infrastructure buildings taken over by enemies, and the roads of the UAC. -Looking for diamond cases.-Completing main missions for both the APR and the UFLL; (kill this guy, destroy this outpost, destroy part of the UAC’s infrastructure) and side missions that include buddy missions (kill this guy, blow up this structure, retrieve this object) , underground missions (give these passports to these refugees to get Malaria pills) gun runner missions(blow up this weapons convoy), and assassinations (kill random guy in suit and his bodyguards). These are all the mission varieties you will ever have.I listed driving first because you will be doing it A LOT in this game. There are only four fast travel points (bus stations) per section of the map (two sections); and most of your missions will force you to drive even if you take a bus to be closer to your destination. Unfortunately, driving in Far Cry 2 is hampered tremendously by two things: enemy patrols and the overall terrain. You can't go for even 4 minutes of driving without some patrol truck hunting you down. It gets worse at the second act of the game, when they get heavy mounted MGs and even one hit kill grenade launchers. Your vehicle will get stuck all the time in small holes in the ground, rocks, tree roots, small trees, other cars, etc. At least there’s a wide and believable variety of vehicles to choose from, ranging from trucks, ATVs, actual Jeeps, and even a buggy. The shooting in this game can be immensely satisfying. You can either go in guns blazing with machine guns, snipe from afar, use a mortar to thin out enemy positions, burn them with a flamethrower, or blow them up with RPGs. Stealth is supposedly an option, but the game isn’t really built for it since shooting even with silenced weapons alerts all the enemies in the vicinity.There are a lot of weapons to choose from, including assault rifles, pistols, machine pistols, LMGs, RPGs, sniper rifles, grenade launchers, etc. Experimenting with these will be your main incentive to obtain more diamonds, which will allow you to buy more of these weapons and their respective accuracy and reliability upgrades. Weapon jams and explosions are a feature of the game. The longer you use a weapon, the more prone it is to jam and eventually explode, and since all enemies use worn out weapons, buying from the arms dealer with your diamonds is a must.The combat AI in this game is well designed for the most part. Wound an enemy and his ally will come to his aid, allowing you to kill them both. Enemies will shoot towards your last known location, and if you’re no longer there, you can flank and shoot them with ease. The AI feels dynamic and believable, but it is relentless. If you’re spotted by an enemy patrol they will chase you, even on foot, and shoot you until you take them out. It can be quite overwhelming to face more than five of them at a time, because the foliage will prevent you from shooting back properly. Now, this game has several underdeveloped ideas that all aim towards a more “realistic” experience, but only interrupt gameplay and annoy the player. The worst offender by far is Malaria. You will need Malaria pills to treat your symptoms for every 40 minutes of real time. If your Malaria goes untreated, you will faint and magically reappear at the nearest main city. It breaks the flow of gameplay during exploration and missions. Were it not for Malaria, you wouldn’t even touch the Underground missions.You can repair any damage to your vehicles, (from explosions to machinegun fire) by tightening a single socket in the engine. Buying the vehicle’s manual (10-20 diamonds per manual), allows you to tighten the socket faster, but there are no changes in the animations or in the way you repair vehicles. Overall, it’s much simpler to find a new vehicle instead of stopping every 5 minutes to repair. In terms of player progression and overall changes in the game world, this game is quite lacking. When completing main missions,none of the factions will care that you recently murdered their leaders and hundreds of their comrades. Your missions are supposed to be “top secret” which supposedly explains why every outpost and soldier wants you dead even if you’re doing missions for their faction. But really, it’s too obvious that the developers simply didn’t code friendly AI for the soldiers. You will destroy a lot of the country’s infrastructure: the train tracks, the morphine production centers, the Malaria pill shacks, the WATER PIPELINES, the diamond mines, etc. You can visit these places again and see the destruction firsthand, but the amount and types of enemies, the amount of drinking water, diamonds, Malaria pills and the way to obtain them, will pretty much remain the same. Your efforts to support either faction end up feeling pointless.The same happens with buddy missions. You can have two buddies: One for upgrading the many safehouses throughout the UAC, and one that can come to your rescue if you get fatally wounded. You earn points by doing additional mission objectives for your buddy, or doing buddy missions, which is really pointless considering that a “level 3 buddy” will give you all the same benefits as a “level 15 buddy”.  You never learn anything new from their stories, which are summed up in two or three sentences at most. Hunting for diamond cases can be a lot of fun, but some of them seem to be impossible to reach. Nowadays it can be regarded as a way to pad out game length, but I found entertaining.*SPOILERS* The story in this game won’t pick up until the second act. You will support the equally tyrannical and selfish APR and UFLL because you’re looking for information about the whereabouts of the Jackal. But your character never really tries to learn where the Jackal is, and your employers never tell you anything. You will NEVER hunt down the Jackal, and by the third time you see him, you will be working with him. It just feels nonsensical because of all the people and infrastructure you will destroy for killing a single guy who probably caused less death and destruction than you did. The game justifies this change of heart by presenting the Jackal as a “humanist” who is tired of the war and wants to save the civilians, but it all feels forced. The developers need to be given credit for how gorgeous the game looks even for 2016 standards, and the style that they chose for the game. The game runs smoothly and beautifully on modern rigs, and asides from a few AI glitches, everything looks, sounds, and feels as if you were in an actual African jungle, savannah, or desert. Structures, vehicles and weapons look used, broken down, barely functional, worn out. It really adds to the immersion in a spectacular way. The way you can create dynamic bushfires in this game is amazing and a viable strategy in the drier regions of the map.Despite all all of its problems, inconsistencies, glitches, and underdeveloped ideas, this game can be a lot of fun. It took me a while to complecomplete my first playthrough on Infamous difficulty, along with all the side missions, almost all of the diamond cases, and all the weapon and vehicle upgrades. All the while, I was having a blast on the combat segments; even if the driving wasn’t so smooth and game progression was non-existent. I can safely recommend this game to anyone remotely interested in open world or FPS games, just know that this ride can get a bit bumpy.			"

												In Far Cry 2's chaotic world of mercenaries, gunrunners, and armed militias, you'll find yourself dropped into a dizzying web of shady clients and paper-thin alliances. All manner of names and faces are introduced during the course of the storyline, but the real star isn't anyone brandishing a smuggled weapon in search of blood diamonds; it's the daunting and awe-inspiring 50-square kilometers of African landscape that make up the game's open-world setting. Aside from providing the opportunity to soak up an amazing sunset, Far Cry 2's free-roaming terrain brilliantly harmonizes with the first-person combat. The diverse landscape and myriad environmental factors work alongside a wide assortment of weaponry to give you tremendous freedom to approach each mission. Combined with solid multiplayer, Far Cry 2's sheer breadth of action provides you with plenty of reason to stay lost in the African wilderness despite an underwhelming plot and the occasional sense of tedium in navigating from one location to another on the gargantuan map.Far Cry 2 is quite the looker.Far Cry 2 is quite the looker.Far Cry 2's story is filled with potential. You're a mercenary working for a client who's sent you to an unnamed African nation engulfed in civil war, and your job is to take out a notorious arms dealer known as ""The Jackal."" He quickly proves to be an elusive figure, so you'll need to begin working for various warring factions that the Jackal has armed so you can trace the supply line back to your target. The two primary organizations at the heart of all this bloodshed are the militaristic UFLL and the revolutionary APR. You'll spend the bulk of the story working for these two groups, getting to know their power structures, and taking on all of the violent tasks they throw your way. Complicating things is the fact that your character has malaria, which means you'll need to occasionally play nice with the more ragtag Underground, the only group with the medical connections necessary to keep your potentially life-threatening symptoms at bay.Each story mission can be played in multiple ways. There are 12 potential buddies randomly scattered throughout the storyline who you can befriend (nine of whom are available to choose as your silent protagonist), and they're often keen to tack on their own interests to the quests handed out by the UFLL and APR. Instead of just taking out a target, you have the option to earn extra reputation points by working alongside your buddy to first squeeze any remaining assets from the soon-to-be-deceased. This also earns you the ability to increase your level of companionship with that buddy. It's a neat reward, but it doesn't shed much light on their backgrounds. But that's par for the course; the main story is delivered in such a rushed, quick-and-dirty way that you never feel very involved in the game's overarching conflicts. The plot is less Blood Diamond than it is early Grand Theft Auto, a long roster of changing faces that scroll by far too quickly to capitalize on the politically charged setting.Although disappointing for a single-player campaign that could easily drain more than 30 hours of your time, any shortcomings in the plot are mostly forgivable thanks to Far Cry 2's overall structure. The game is organized in a way that provides a daunting amount of freedom to explore, earn currency, and wreak havoc on the game's landscape and its denizens. It's all laid out in a manner typical of sandbox action games. Pulling out your map reveals a collection of icons that signify available missions and points of interest that you can meander toward at your own leisure. Among these are dozens of side missions that you can take on, with various forms of rewards. Delivering transit papers to trapped refugees earns you malaria medication, destroying rival convoys for gun merchants unlocks new weapons for purchase, and performing assassinations for mysterious voices at the other end of your cell phone rewards you with diamonds. You can also rough up militias stationed in small camps and turn their dwellings into your own safe houses. The side missions can feel a bit repetitive when played through in rapid succession, but they offer a great change of tempo when sprinkled throughout the main narrative. But what's most clever is how their differing rewards intermingle so wonderfully with your needs in progressing through the story: Malaria pills keep your HP and stamina up, diamonds buy you new weapons and ability upgrades, and safe houses provide temporary shelter to stock up and save your game.With so much ground to cover, you'll be spending a lot of time driving, boating, running, and swimming.With so much ground to cover, you'll be spending a lot of time driving, boating, running, and swimming.The freedom of choice that goes with selecting which mission you want to perform carries over to how you execute them, and that's where Far Cry 2 really shines. There are a variety of factors that affect the way you approach each mission, from the number of people you need to kill, to the landscape, to the weather and time of day. If your job is to take out a key figure hidden deep within a militia camp in the jungle, you'll do well to take a nap at your safe house until nightfall and silently stalk your prey under the cover of darkness. If it's a windy day and you need to take out a bandit outpost in the dry plains, you can start a fire from far away with a flare gun and let the breeze and arid conditions collude to spread the flames toward their camp, finishing off the survivors with a sniper rifle. Need to clear out a bunch of scattered guards? Why not shoot an oil drum near an ammo stockpile and watch as the bullets erupt in every direction like deadly pieces of popcorn? Of course, you can also get up close and personal with pistols and machine guns, but the moments in which elaborately planned assaults succeed are some of the most gratifying points in the game. The whole process of staging an attack only becomes more intricate and rewarding as you slowly upgrade your safe house into a full-blown armory and unlock new weapon and vehicle abilities--all done through the gun shops.Overall, Far Cry 2 is a game in which you can quite literally get lost for hours at a time. But that feeling of exploration is precisely what makes the game so much fun; your creativity never feels stifled when approaching a mission, and the game's overall structure of side tasks, friends, rewards, and upgrades is a diverse ecosystem rivaling the landscape itself. No matter whether you're a PC fan whose played through the similarly structured Crysis or a console owner new to the world of open-ended first-person shooters, you won't be disappointed by Far Cry 2.

												By far one fo the weirdest in the far cry series, Far Cry 2 is still one of my favourite games today. Buying it on PC again just reminded me how awesome the feels of this game were, and how different it was to any of the other games at the time of it's release.A must play for anyone who's a fan of Far Cry - also the main base model for the series UI and Combat success.

												After spending too many hours, 46 hours, playing the game I have to say is pretty fun but the lacks the capacity to surprise the player after 4-6 hours of gameplay. Missions tend to be repetitive, the history is not attractive enough and the ability to call your teammates in some mission is annoying most of the time. They only make you waste your time.So it's a pretty good shooter video game and it's prize nowadays is pretty affordable, however, as I said, after some hours of gameplay, FairCry 2 is kind of ""boring"". But you know, price es very competitive so if you don't have much money can be an option.Cheers,R "

												It took every part of my being to push through and finally see Far Cry 2 to the end. This is because it's not only mentally exhausting, but emotionally as well.Let's get what it doesn't do well out of the way, because it doesn't do a lot of ♥♥♥♥ well. There's all sorts of fun things that people hate like weapon degredation, the malaria mechanic which gives you a vomit-tinged screen until you press H and pop a refreshing malaria-fighting Certs into your mouth, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ open world which is full of repetitive quests that revolve around shooting the other soldiers of fortune you're working alongside of, or shooting a man in a suit, or blowing up a truck that's driving around in circles. It's really, really ♥♥♥♥ing grindy too. The secondary missions don't offer much more than just your stupid mercenary friend calling you up in the middle of your mission to ask you to do something so he can be a bigger, more amoral ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for dollars than you can. All it is is you being an unpleasant little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for money to other unpleasant little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s also here for money. Are you still with me? Good. Because it turns out that this game has so many flaws it has essentially developed Three Stooges Syndrome, the syndrome where it has lots of bad ideas yet they all don't end up killing the game, but rather strengthening it.All of the things up there would normally have killed my interest in this game really ♥♥♥♥ing dead. And they did the last two times I tried to play it, all the way back in 2010. But today, the game clicks for me. I don't know whether it was the depressed state I was in or whether I've realized that AAA video game design has been so design-by-committee that this was the thing I ended up dying for. This game ended up satisfying something I wasn't aware that I needed than, say, Grand Theft Auto 5 or Saints Row the Third, which are just straight-up celebrations of how awesome you are. Far Cry 2 tells you to your face that you're just another ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in a jungle with a barely functioning weapon, and that you won't matter if you live or die.But also at this point in time, the mental state of your mind also is very, very helpful when getting into this game. In order to actually sit down and play it, you must learn to accept the environment that the game is forcing you into. Everything is ♥♥♥♥. War is constant. The missions suck. Nothing really works. You are accepting missions in order to make like worse for everybody. Your guns get dirty really fast. You're trading rough diamonds for all the guns you can get your hands on. Absolute ♥♥♥♥♥ in buggies and jeeps and cars will drive off the road to try and run you down for no other reason than you are there, and you are a target, and everyone hates you. Everyone hates you here in Africa, and if it means that you will die so that there's one less target to shoot, you're gonna get shot. The work is absolutely repetitive, the fast travel system is the worst, and if you lose your car because some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s blew it up because they were trying to shoot you while you were using your car for cover, you're gonna have to hoof it. You are a person in a ♥♥♥♥ tornado. And the ♥♥♥♥ tornado has everyone you know and love in it. And you all can't stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ into the ♥♥♥♥ tornado. And because you all can't stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the ♥♥♥♥ gets into your eyes and mouth and face and you're swearing bloody revenge on the people who keep involuntarily ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ into the ♥♥♥♥ tornado, and soon you're all at each others throats while your lives become nothing but ♥♥♥♥ and tornadoes and blood and broken teeth.That's what it's like to play Far Cry 2. I don't recommend it for everyone. Hell, I don't know who I can recommend it for. It's a great game because it evokes that experience and keeps it consistent up to the end, but it's such an unpleasant experience that I'm surprised it got published at all.Besides, didn't Spec Ops the Line do this sort of thing, but within ten hours?

												Far Cry 2 has a good storyline, enough to give you a reason to keep moving forward and shooting more people.

												What's best about Far Cry 2?The true answer is that there is no one thing that can be considered best about Far Cry 2. Its brilliance lies in the fact that it is more than the sum of its already impressive parts. Essentially the game is a playground that caters for whatever mood players find themselves in. Want to storm into an enemy encampment in broad daylight John Rambo style, perhaps running a few unfortunate soldiers down with a MG-mounted Jeep before letting loose with your grenade launcher? Go ahead. Prefer to fast-forward the incredible day/night cycle to midnight by taking a nap in one of the Safe Houses and sneak in under the cover of darkness before slicing and dicing from behind with your machete? Be the game's guest.Ubisoft Montreal isn't, of course, the first developer to do open world shooting.But it is so well executed, so technically proficient that I can't help but feel it at least matches and in some areas even surpasses other games of the genre.After choosing from a selection of nine refreshingly un-clichéd mercenaries, ranging from a 45-year-old Mauritian to a 38-year-old Algerian you're thrust into an unnamed African country being torn apart by two warring factions.Your mission: To kill The Jackal, an arms dealer who's fuelling both sides of the conflict with weapons, and making a mint as a result. You immediately run into problems - malaria wraps its diseased mitts around your innards, forcing you to collapse as soon as you arrive in town. You wake, groggily, and find The Jackal standing ominously above you. He knows everything - who you are, why you're here and how defenceless you've become as a result of the malaria. In pity, he hands you a machete and a hand gun, and lets you live. This is where Far Cry 2 kicks off.Outside, all hell breaks loose. The United Front for Liberation and Labour (UFLL) and the Alliance for Popular Resistance (APR) are going at it in the streets. You make a break for it, dodging bullets as you head anywhere as long as it's away from certain death. But there is no escape - either you're shot or you collapse from the malaria. You wake in a slaughter house just outside town. A merc, one that you did not pick to play as at the beginning of the game but is determined by that choice, now reckons you owe him a few favours on account of him saving your ♥♥♥. From there, it's up to you what jobs you take on, whether it be paid work from the UFLL or APR, malaria pill jobs from various good Samaritans, weapon vendor jobs that unlock new purchasable gear, buddy jobs that improve your 'history' with the NPC mercs or assassination jobs dished out by a disguised voice heard from communication masts. What they all have in common, however, is combat, and it's here that Far Cry 2 initially frustrates.I'm used to developers holding my hands so tightly during game tutorials, and even beyond, that Far Cry 2 will at first jar with many due to the fact that it's actually pretty tough right from the start. Simply shooting stuff is difficult. Unlike the console versions, the PC version doesn't have a snap to target function when you zoom down the barrel of your gun. This is fine - the PC keyboard and mouse set up allows for a degree of FPS accuracy console controllers simply can't. But this doesn't stop your weapons, especially at the beginning of the game, from being, frankly, crap.You'll find the recoil offensive, the jamming so regular you'll tear your hair out and the enemies so hard to spot in your splendid surroundings that it won't be long before you grab a mouthful of dirt. The healing system doesn't help. Whenever your health dips you can inject yourself with magic hit point juice. That's fine, but when your health bar is almost depleted healing will instead trigger an animation where you gruesomely pick bullets out of the holes in your skin. The problem is that this animation, which takes about five seconds to complete, is interruptible by enemy fire. Some will applaud Ubisoft Montreal's approach. Some will criticise it. Whatever your opinion, persevere. Soldier through the difficult opening few hours, keep earning diamonds, keep reducing the recoil and reliability of your weapons with upgrades, and above all, keep experimenting, because it's only through experimentation that you'll realise Far Cry 2's undoubted potential.The save system differs from the console versions in that you can save absolutely anywhere and whenever you want. There are no checkpoints in Far Cry 2, at least not in the traditional sense of the term. Instead, you'll get a pop-up asking you if you want to save after you complete mission objectives, when you use the coach transportation system or when you go to sleep using one of the Safe Houses. The many guarded checkpoints will annoy some, but for others they will reinforce the feeling that you're never safe. Because the map is so big, you'll spend a lot of your time driving around. If you're going to stick to the road, you're going to run into at least three checkpoints along the way. Every soldier manning the checkpoints has a shoot first, ask questions later policy, too, making driving more a case of survival than sight seeing. The enemies respawn, too, so you can never once and for all clear enemies from that check point on that road you keep using to get to and from town.Obviously if you're a shooter fan you should buy this game. A simple glance at the score should confirm in your mind, if there was ever any doubt, that Far Cry 2 is nothing but brilliant.			"

												This is a fantastic game with one of the best environments and gameplay I have ever experienced. Despite this, I have heard so many complaints and gripes about this fine title. Many jump into this open world game expecting the many side missons of FC3, or the hand holding of many modern FPS games, and complain when FC2 does not accomidate them. Many also whine when the story does not cater to their ideals and makes them make hard, immoral, decisions. ""The story is crap,"" they say ""The ending made me feel bad."" I've also heard many complain that playing as an often heartless merc made them feel uncomfortable. How can that be bad? If a game can provoke an emotional response like that, then it has done a fine job. I have heard people, in the same breath, complain about the fast respawn time for enemy outposts breaking immersion, then say that the method of quick travel (finding a bus to take you to another bus stop after a loading screem) isn't easy enough to access and traveling is a pain. I say false to both statements, especially since they contradict each other. Having a world full of hostile entities makes you prepare for such encouters, and also refills the world with more enemies to fight, something that I feel FC3 lacked after you cleared out outposts. As for having to drive for awhile for any mission, I never could go more than a minute without something exploding, cathcing fire, or shooting at me. With all of this being said, I do acknowledge that this game is not for everyone. Since it does NOT hold your hand in, and instead is fairly abrasive, be it via malaria attack, a lucky mortar strike, or a jamming gun, it likely doesn't appeal to anyone who is looking for some mindless fun/action a la Metal Gear Rising or FC3. This game is rough, and can be frusterating at times, but because of these same qualities, I love this game for not being afraid of trying something different. As a result, I have never played another FPS that has gotten my heart rate up so much everytime an enemy appeared.Play it, try it, but DON'T expect FC2 to hand you anything.			"

												Probably the least enjoyable game of 2,3 and 4, due to lack of content but still really good. Its so much more intense than the follow ups since the voice acting for the general enemy AI is actually decent, there is vertually no HUD so the only way of finding your enemys is through sight and sound- which makes for some ♥♥♥♥ing shocking surprises- and the graphics are good, kind of realistic in a way i cant explain, so its really immersive. Shame about the music, but you can just turn that off. And wow the writing for the antagonist 'the jackal' is brilliant, like wow, the encounters you have with him are good, but its the tapes he leaves behind justifying his evil that really shine. So worth buying.			"

The other things in the game are for you to explore!                                                            9.7/10 with a Amaing Gowwden medal!			"

												This game is all about the gunplay and I do mean ALL about the gunplay. The missions and the dialouge are highly repetitive and it's only made worse by the long travel times between objectives interspersed with infinitely respawning enemies who make the long travel times even longer by shooting up your car. And don't get me started on the story, mainly because there barely isn't any. It got to be that I started playing it as an RPG, creating my own character and motivations but at the end of the game you're only given two choices on what to do, neither of which fit the character I had created, basically nullifying my whole experience.The game has its problems but the gunplay is its great redeemer and in this case it's enough.

												Okay guys, DONT QUICK SAVE WHEN THE BAD GUYS ARE LOOKING FOR YOU. If you load up the quicksave again they will stop looking for you wherever they spotted before and magically know where you are currently. Just a little Bug. Also if you need to be really sneaky use the xbox controller, which will let you walk really slow if you just push the stick a tiny bit. On keyboard you can oly walk at one speed.For maximum fun play on Hard mode, dont try Insane unless you are a crazy person.Despite all that, I LOVE THIS GAME. Its so much better then 3 and 4 and the graphics are still beautiful today. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.			"

												This game started my gaming hobby. Just bought the Steam version not too long ago, so it doesn't look like i've played it long. Trust me, this game might get a lot of negative flak, but it is one of the most immersive, entertaining, and blood-pumping games I have ever seen/played.Multiplayer works over LAN, and has a very easy to use map creator. Pick up a copy today and have fun!			"

												TL;DR ... for all its faults, FC2 is a ""summer popcorn movie"" video game that's enjoyable if you just switch your brain off and go with the flow.~~~~~~~~~~~BackgroundFC2 came out when ""open world"" and ""50+ hours of gameplay"" started becoming buzzwords on games. It comes from the generation of games that were more focused on creating massive playing areas, then didn't have enough time to pad them with actual game play.So, they slapped in a bunch of repetetive, cookie-cutter missions, scavenger hunts and enemy AI that's stupid but makes up for it by being programmed to cheat.I got this game when it first came out, b/c I had just built a new dual-core rig (when dual-cores had just come out), and wanted to see what it could do by playing Crysis, Far Cry 2, and other games of the time. Picked it up again during steam summer sale, and the good and bad come rushing back.To pro/con it, I have to break it down by components, since each component has pro/con.~~~~~~~~~~~PLOTPro: it tries to delve into some deeper aspects about moralityCon: It gets pretty pretentious and self-righteous for it's own good. It's hard to follow as you're thrown right into the middle of confusion without much explanation, and even your journal and cut-scene tip text doesn't help much. But, overall, you're not missing much. You're basically a lackey for everyone, so switch your brain off and ignore thinking.~~~~~~~~~~~NPC'sPro: there's large varieties of themCon: They were trying to cut-down on file size, so it seems they sped up everyone's dialogue after recording it. Everyone talks super-fast, which makes it difficult to follow, especially ones that have accents.~~~~~~~~~~~ALLIESPro: you get a ""buddy"" that can help revive you out in the fieldCon: it feels like what they wanted to do was let you have an AI NPC follow you on missions like a side-kick. Instead, they were rushed for time, couldn't implement that, so instead they just implement some half-a**ed cutscene with a buddy helping you out, then acting completely stupid in fire fights as they die from either standing out in the middle of now where, getting caught in a brush fire like an idiot, etc, etc. Basically, to enjoy the game, just think of your Allies as nothign more then quest givers, and ignore any aspect of them ""participating"" with you...because you will feel it is very lackluster if you do think of them as a ""companion"".~~~~~~~~~~~MISSIONSPro: there's lots of themCon: they're all the same cookie-cutter design ... go here, kill everything, collect this. I don't mind that so much (again, we're switching our brains off to enjoy this). What bothers me is you can only have 1 quest at a time. And the quest giver and the actual quest are usually on opposite sides of the massive map. So, you get a quest, spend half an hour getting there, complete it in 5 minutes, then spend another half hour getting back to the quest giver. While out and about, you will see other quest opportunities. You can't take them, or they will cancel your current quest. This is beyond dumb. For a map of this size, they should let you gather quests, then take care of all of them at once when in the area of operation.~~~~~~~~~~~ENEMIESPro: there's a variety of enemy dress and faces, plus they use guns you can useCon: the enemy AI is a bipolar mess of smart and dumb. You sniper a guy, and some will take cover while others try to investigate. Some will flank you and surprise you, but you realize they can only do this because their footsteps have been purposefully made extra quiet so you don't hear them. So, it feels cheap when they ambush you. The ones taking cover behind buildings won't come out. You can sneak around and pick them off with a sniper from a distance and they stay in duck-n-cover formation. I literally looked over a cliff. Saw two guys hiding. I shot one. The other guy didn't do anything. He just saw his buddy die, but he keeps hiding there. I shoot him, too. *facepalm* The devs purposefully made the AI cheat to give them a competitive advantage to challenge you. They will use their amazing eagle eyes to spot you through foliage and cover then chase or snipe you even though they are nothing but a dot in your sniper scope. Their clothes blend into the color pallette of the game, so it's hard to detect them. They will make next to no noise while walking through brush looking for you even though you sound like a herd of elephants while crouch-sneaking. When the game first came out (before patches) they were even able to run 50mph to catch up to you if you were driving through a checkpoiint without engaging them (thankfully that seems to have been fixed). But, basically... don't expect super impressive AI.~~~~~~~~~~~GUNPLAYPro: FC2 let's you load out with a primary, secondary and support weapon. This is pretty ingenious, because it lets you tailor your load out to your play style and/or mission.Con: I usually consider myself good at FPS (grew up on Doom and Quake), but FC2 has been brutal in run-n-gun play style. The PC is slow, can't sprint very far or fast, and likes to stop moving to do lots of activities (eg: malaria kicks in... better stop in the middle of this street while getting shot to take a pill instead of letting the player make me keep walking while doing so). Machine guns are jump as all get out, but sniper rifles have completely perfect, stationary zoom making head shots from a mile easy. Standing 10' away from a guy, you will watch as you can't hit him point-blank... unless you bring up your iron sights to target. You get a silenced sniper rifle (dart rifle), but it's not considered a primary weapon and is severely hobbled on ammo. There's just all these baffling design decisions.~~~~~~~~~~~WORLDPro: it's largeCon: everything is the same color pallete of ""browns and greens that easily blend into each other"". The world is so large that it takes half an hour to get to your mission site. There are so many mountains that all driving feels like ""corridor"" driving in that you rarely have very open areas to zoom through. Plus, when there are, there are so many trees and rocks in the way you can't really go too fast. There doesn't seem to be any permanancy in the world, too. You take a car from a place. Come back later... the car is there again, reset, as if it was never taken. And nobody gets upset over you taking vehicles. There are ""checkpoints"" throughout the place where enemies hang out and make it hard to pass through. You clear one out. Come back 5 minutes later...it's repopulated again like nothing happened! This makes you feel as if your actions are pointless / worthless, and dissuades you from clearing places out. (ie: you would have incentive to clear a place out if it stayed cleared out, but since it respawns 5 seconds later, you start to just avoid conflicts by going out of your way to go around those places since they just become time wasters). Diamonds are used as currency to buy new weapons, and they spread HUNDREDS of these suit cases to go scavenger hunt all over the place to pad the game with ""game play"" that isn't really compelling game play.~~~~~~~~~~~Did I mention you need to switch your brain off?There's a lot ""wrong"" with the game, but it is what it is due to the open-world fantacism + huge push for better graphics that was all the rage back then (and still sort of is).Overall, I still recommend the game, because it's entertaining going on missions and clearing places out. Sitting on a rock sniping people, pulling out a grenade launcher and blowing up vehicles with occupants still in them, tossing a moltov and lighting up a bunch of grass to burn people to death... it's mind-numbing fun.The game is best if you fire it up, spend an hour running a mission, then turning it off for a bit.

												Let me start by saying that this open-world FPS isn't for everyone. I started playing this game years ago, and i finally finished it only a couple weeks ago. This is partly because of the massiveness of the game, and partly because of the repetitive nature of it. One review i read of this game said it's the game that ""doesn't give you what you want, and slaps you for asking"". This is very true, the game presents many obstacles (guns that deteriorate and jam, malaria that makes you have to take medicine at any given point in the game, lack of ammo & resources, etc.) and doesn't have a single auto save. Every save is manual. Every. One. Fast travel is hardly any faster than driving across the giant map, because you can only travel to and from one of 5 fast travel stations on the map. And let me tell you, vehicles in this game do NOT go fast.This giant stew of inconveniences is what gives this game it's value. The setting is Africa, a wasteland containing only violence, disease, and scarcity. By making the player endure these frustrations, Far Cry 2 gives every convenience you recieve a kind of personal importance. The regular attacks from enemies beat you down until you become a proud killing machine. The slow and dangerous nature of transportation in this open world gives you a familiarity with the map, and maybe (what happened in my case) an unprecedented respect for the design. The story plays a passive role in this game (kill things, get payed, get closer to completing your main mission), but it fits into the violent & depressing theme. The ending, however, is fantastic. This game is slow. The combat is relentless and routine. You have to struggle to complete each mission, and the characters are all shallow. By stripping away all the usual comforts you would expect to find, Far Cry 2 does something extraordinary. It puts you outside of your comfort zone. You're alone in this troublesome world, and you have to discover for yourself how to make it out alive.			"

												Far Cry 2 is the most epic Far Cry game I have ever played the story for this game is just amazing it really keeps you hooked in the open world just blew me away there is so many things you can do after you have finished the game and really we don't get much FPS open world games and I would say Far Cry is probably one of the best FPS open world games out there. This really is a huge improvement over the first Far Cry being the first FC game to have openworld it really has developed a lot of new features that the first Far Cry didn't have. FC2's multiplayer you can invite your friends to join you but watch your back as you never know who your true friends are and who might betray you! All the single player technical features are also present in multiplayer mode. In Far Cry 2 you have a chance to explore a war torn African state and you are forced to make deals with corrupt warlords on both sides of the conflict this game's story really keeps people entertained and makes them not want to stop playing it is just an amazing story. They have changed the gameplay features of Far Cry 2 so unlike the first FC game there will be a lot of things that are different about the game and with the Fortune's pack DLC you can get access to new vehicles and weapons that are not in the game unless you bought the Far Cry 2 Fortune's Edition. Overall I give this game a 10/10 it is just a fantastic game to have in your collection and I think this game is definitely worth the money. So I suggest you go and get this game bros I am sure it will not disappoint you in anyway at all!.			"

												You are dropped in a war-torn african country, you have one mission. Kill the man that has been arming both sides. The gameplay is simpley amazing. The gun-play is next level and the environment gives you a feeling that the country is in horrible conditions and help is a far cry away. The most complaints i hear about FC2 is the weapon jamming and outpost, but for me it makes it more real. The outposts makes you strategicaly move from point to point and the jamming can ruin a firefight for you. It all makes it more difficult to survive, and instead of holding your hand all the time the game lets you approch how you want to. There are a lot of unlockables, weapons and uppgrades to let you play how you want to. Either run-n-gun or ninja style, and it does this well. Lots of games offer this, But FC2 manages this in a terrific way. The only complain i have is that the missions are very similar, little variety. But the different playstyles is enough to keep things fresh.All in all i would say this is one of the best games i have ever played. It is almost 8 years old, but is a though competitor for even the newest games.Im giving this 8/10 bacon strips.			"

Far Cry 2 is one of a kind experience and although is quite criticized by fans of the franchise I find it to be one of the most underrated games I have seen.50km2 of awesomness	Set on Africa, you take the role of a mercenary who finds himself in a middle of a war. The Government has been dismantled and there are now two factions trying to take control over it. Your goal is simple: kill the Jackal, an infamous drug dealer who benefits from the war selling guns to both factions.	In order to do so, you must shot your way to the Jackal. You can ally with both or just one faction which makes for a non-linear story; something really appreciated for those who value replay-ability.	Powered by Dunia Engine, the visuals are really well done and you will find yourself on savannas and desserts within a effectively designed world. The engine does a good job improving the stealth aspect thanks to day/night cycles that actually varies the way the IA work as well as includying dynamic fire propagation on the grass along others. Inmersive and awesome to explore	As the franchise got as accustomed, the world is filled with cars, trucks, hang gliders, boats and ATV's. Throughout the story, you will need to take pills that help you to control your malaria. Oh, yeah! You got malaria at the very beginning of the story. Failing to take said pills (which runs out really fast) will make you pass out and you will have to restart the mission again.	There is not a big selection of guns on this one though. I have to note also just how minimalistic and inmersive the interface on this game is. You don't check the map by a popup window in front of the actual gameplay but rather, your character holds an actual map wherever you need it and so on with a lot of elements on the game. Those are little details I love to find given they improve the impression that you are really there.It definitely has its problems, though	I hope you like driving, because oh boy, you are going to drive a lot. Not that it gets incredibly tedious. During your driving you will find enemies along the way which helps keeping things interesting. However, you are still going to drive a lot.	Likewise, to be considered a realistic game it's surprising how long it takes to kill enemies. Not everyday you see a regular person wearing nothing but a t-shirt get shot six times on the chest and still count the story, but enemies on Far Cry 2 sure can. Nevertheless, it works both ways considering you can walk to an enemy from a good distance while he is shooting directly at you and still kill him with a machete. The story is great, with interesting dialogues and memorable quotes but I really could never put my heands on the multiplayer, something about Ubisoft's servers not responding when I tried to sing up. I have never heard of it being shut down but to be honest I haven't bothered to look up much on the subject. Multiplayer was just a feature in this game, singleplayer is where the fun part is at.Playing this game on the Hardcore or Infamous difficulty mode makes it so much enjoyable, really. Because you can't get shot nearly as much as Normal you start making better strategies than just show up with your car in the middle of your enemy's base and start shooting everywhere like you were blind-folded. So, should you buy it? You're damn right you should. Far Cry 2 has to be one of the most enjoyable shooters I have ever played. An awesome game about exploring, surviving and killing so you can get a sweet, sweet revenge on everything the Jackal has put you and others through. Oh, and also, about driving. A hella lot of it. Let's also take a moment to appreciate the fact that this was (and probably will) be the last Far Cry without uPlay DRM. Anyway, despite all the flaws (which aren't that many, really) Far Cry 2 is well worthy of your money.			"

												Cabela's African Adventure 2 is a thrilling joyride to the heart of the African soul and spirit of hunting through the eyes of a mute foreigner who has come to visit his old pal Steve Rambo, who has started a new life as a hunting instructor and a Nietzche fanatic. As you, the noble white man, enter the country, the atmosphere instantly contracts you with Malaria and you have to face the ultimate test of survival to find your old pal Steve Rambo. In the game you hunt the most dangerous prey of all, Malaria pills. In the process you must cope with the locals who are  actually all foreigners too, but all the locals have left, so does that make the foreigners the locals? This is one of the mysteries the game gives you, the story keeps you guessing as you do work for two guys who hang out with foreigners all the time. Bill and Ted give you folders of diamonds instantly transferred to your International Diamond Account and order you to blow ♥♥♥♥ up, giving you the dough whether you actually go to complete the task or not. They also warn that their men will also shoot you because it's that much of a black op, but aren't they all foreigners as well? Both the UFLL (United Females Lottery League) and APR (American Punk Rockers) mercenaries look the same, so how can they tell eachother apart? See, this is the level of deep story and imagery the game gives you. Overall Cabela's African Adventure 2 is a fantastic game about learning medical perscription, maintaining vehicles and dealing with the explosive tourism that plagues the country.			"

												a must-have for any Far Cry/ Hardcore FPS Fan.Be thrown into an unnamed war torn African Country, as you try to find an arms dealer known as the ""Jackal"" but as luck would have it you get stricken by the infamous Malaria, and have to fight to survive on the outside while fighting an invader from the inside.as you will come across, the guns in FC2 are like real guns that will jam and eventually break. and you must be careful not to come across these problems in a firefight. these are Cold War/late Colonial era weapons and their age shows. when you first get these weapons from other arms dealer, they will be in pristine condition but eventually as you use them they will wear and tear, and become less and less reliable.P.S. if you get Far Cry 2 run it on the DX9 version, the Dx10 version has a bug that will without warning crash to desktop. Ubisoft never fixed this, so run on dx9 for optimal performance.			"

The is also the fact that over time you will need to take malaria pills so you dont die and do missions to get more, Also guns in the game will slowly worse in condition and you will need to find a new one or go to a gun shop using the game's currency of Diamonds which can be found in the game world as well.10/10			"

												Where to start with this game, it's definitely a step up from far cry 1 and I would put it quite close to or slightly better than far cry 3. First I would like to add that it's a cool feature having guns rust and jam after a while. The terrain is very accurate to what Africa is, with both desert and jungle filling the maps. Very good graphics. It's interesting how you can choose your character with the only affect is that you don't appear as an npc in the game.One of the problems I had with the game is that the story stretches out too long so I end up forgeting what im supposed to be doing in the first place. Enemies can also appear out off nowhere and kill you, sending you back to the last save (which happens alot when your on the hardest difficulty). I'm also a bit disappointed that none of the animals tried to kill you, we're in Africa aren't we?The main problems with the game is the fast travel system because the only fast travel you have is the five bus stops in each of the corners and centre. The more you quick save the harder it is to load the game manually. (Unless you delete them which I forgot to do). The AI is sometimes dumb and occasional fires through walls. I loved this game, but it is not for the inpatient. 8/10			"

												My take on the game:+ Big map that is separated into two regions connected by a stripe of desert + very good sound not only for guns but also other things (superior to FC3)+ good AI (will flank you, try to drive over you with cars, mortar shell you from a distance, ...)+ Much to do (with anonymous murder contracts, two warrying factions that both are your contractors as well as enemies, ...)+ road blocks and military posts make sure you'll be occupied when travelling between places+ Unusual story+ public transport as the only way to fast travel (and structured in a way that makes you value it)+ ""buddies"" offer alternative ways to complete missions+ kinda good collectables (like very rare golden AK-47, interview recordings with your main villain, ...)+ Guns realistic with old guns jamming and breaking often, ...+ Very good (fire-) physics and dynamic things (at least three times everything FC3 and 4 did / achieved...)- map is cluttered in a way that often seems to artificially, unneccessarily stretch routes so it takes longer to get from one point of the map to the other- missions and targets are often placed literary as far away from you as possible (like: you very often have to travel from one corner of the map to the other...)- there are sounds for animals that are not actually in the game as entities (you'll be hearing lions and so on but only encounter zebras and gnus...)- AI trying to drive you over can be very annoying if you haven't saved in a while (it also sometimes makes some sounds cars make glitch out)- some guns and some enemies are configured in a way that makes late-game enemies bullet sponges which will fall to the ground but then continue to 'last stand' against you with a pistol.- Main Story takes an incredibly long breather between beginning and end, distracting you with the sub-story of the two warrying factions; also takes a rogue turn during the last mission / with the last mission.------------------------------------------------------------Zu Deutsch:Was ich vom Game halte:+ Grosse Karte die in zwei Regionen unterteilt ist, die durch einen streifen Wüste verbunden sind+ Sehr gute Geräusche nicht nur bei den Waffen aber auch anderswo (besser als bei FC3)+ Gute KI (Flankiert einen, versucht dich mit Autos zu überfahren, bombardiert einen mit Mörserbeschuss von weitem, ...)+ Es gibt viel zu tun (mit anonymen Mordaufträgen, zwei kriegstreibende Fraktionen die beide sowohl Auftraggeber als auch Gegner sind, ...)+ Strassenblockadenund militärposten stellen sicher, dass man während dem Reisen beschäftigt bleibt+ Unübliche Geschichte+ Öffentliche Verkehrsmittel / ÖV ist der einzige Schnellreise Weg (und so aufgebaut, dass man es wertschätzt)+ ""Komparsen"" bieten alternative Wege Missionen zu machen+ Gute Sammelgegenstände (wie sehr rare goldene Ak-47, interview Tonbänder mit dem Bösewicht, ...)+ Waffen realistisch indem alte / gebrauchte Waffen schneller klemmen und verschleissen, ...+ Sehr gute (Feuer-) Physik und dynamische Dinge (mind. dreimal mehr als was FC3 oder 4 erreicht...)- Karte ist so vollgestopft, dass es einem so vorkommt als seien Wege künstlich, unnötig in die Länge gezogen worden - Missionen und Missionsziele sind meistens so weit von einender Weg wie möglich plaziert (man muss oft von einem Kartenecken in den gegenüberliegenden...)- Viele Tiere die man als Geräusch hören kann sind nicht wirklich im Game (Man hört etwa Löwen, trifft aber nur Zebras und Gnu's an...)- Dass die KI einen immer überfahren will kann bei längerem nicht-speichern nerven (und sorgt ebenfalls dafür, dass die Fahrzeug Geräusche glitchen)- Einige Waffen und Gegner sind so Konfigueriert, dass sie im Endspiel Kugelschwämme werden welche zu Boden fallen und dann noch mit der Pistole weiterkämpfen- Hauptgeschichte nimmt sich eine sehr lange Auszeit zwischen Anfang und Ende des Games und man wird mit der Geschichte zwischen den beiden Fraktionen abgelenkt; Die Hauptgeschichte nimmt in, mit bzw. bei der Letzten Mission reisaus...

												ONE OF THE BEST FAR CRY'S TO DATE AND THE BEGINNING OF THE OPEN-WORLD FANTASY THAT IS  THE FAR CRY SERIES.  Not too heavy on story more for the explorer, but not too much depth where you lose yourself in the side-elements of the game,  you get back on track pretty quickly and the missions are challenging but dying in firefights is pretty lame, until you gain a few comrades' who pick you up instead of having to re-do your assault missions.  This one doesn't take much from the first Far Cry except the high expectations in graphics and gunplay is more refined in this one.  The Feature of guns wearing after a bit really adds nothing to the game...cept tragedy in the middle of a fight.  There really isn't anything groundbreaking or gamebreaking in this one, a light frills ride through the Exotic African flatlands and forests' and the desterts...One of the best game in the series, has the longest play value, but yet is nothing that you haven't seen before in an open world.  I Had fun with this one.			"

												Finally got around to playing this game. The only reason i never finished it before is because I was annoyed with the malaria aspect but it turns out only to be a minor annoyance in the game. I finished Far Cry 3 before finishing Far Cry 2, although I started playing it years ago. I always knew I would come back to it and I am glad I finally did. I won't do any comparison to the original FarCry because that is entirely a different game, in my opinion.I found FC3 far too easy, being able to track your opponents, even through trees and rocks nerfed the difficulty enough, and getting special superpowers as you level up only made it worse. In FC2, you have malaria, which is like, the opposite of a superpower and became a hazard if you started having an ""attack"" in the middle of battle. And also, you have weapon jams which happen randomly as your weapon wears down. A weapon jam might sound annoying but it is a little detail in the game that adds a little realism and extra challenge to the game which I can appreciate. Your ""buddys"" are randomly chosen from your character choices from the beginning of the game, each with their own look and dialog.  You also have the chance to get incapacitated instead of dying, getting revived by a buddy for a second chance to finish the fight. if you go down too soon after though, it is game over. When you are low on health and apply first aid, the animations go from wrapping up a wound on your arm to pulling a bullet out of your flesh with a knife and plyers. Another way it differs from FC3 is your character is not the focus of the game story whatsoever. The story is really about the Jackal, the factions and Africa, and you are just someone who is in the right place at the wrong time. You do get to choose a character, which only effects how your hands and arms look in the gameAll these little details make a very unique first person shooter experience, and I think really smart game devs can learn from playing this oneIn the end, the only real problem I had with FC2 was not the malaria, but the fact that I couldnt use a custom loadout. Every weapon falled under primary, secondary or special and you could only carry one of each. Meaning I could not use a sniper rifle and an SMG at the same time as they were both considered primary weapons.The good far outweighs the bad though, and if you are jaded with your regular FPS experience, give this one a try.-edit- 2 years after this reviewI'm convinced this was one of Ubisoft's last good games. Also, it doesnt require uplay.			"

												Far cry 2 is like the dark souls of the far cry games. It's a game about getting from point a to b not exploring or ticking off all the open world optional stuff like far cry 3 and 4. The game really shines at the harder difficulties Hardcore and up.   PROS- -very interesting mechanics like: --- malaria.(the lower the malaria level you have the longer you can sprint) --- weapon degradation.(weapons break or jam which makes the gameplay tension --- fire affected by wind(removed in future far cry games; no longer are fires affected by wind or grass type). --- wounding an enemy to set up as bait for other enemies. --- cars break down a lot more than far cry 3 and 4. --- buddy system allows a way to cheat death. --- shooting ammo crates causes shrapnel to occur killing people around it.   -graphics although dated a bit looks pretty good still.  -realism is much greater in this game any of the future titles.  -the story is pretty good, P.S your not a hero in this game, in this game everyone is horrible including yourself.  CONS-  -the response time of checkpoints or locations are ridiculous short. Avoid the checkpoints and find routes through the rough ground (makes the game way more fun), you are also rewarded in game for doing this (with diamonds or tapes and sometimes guns)  - buggy phone calls, sometimes the dialog during phone calls doesn't play which sucks.  -no animal hunting or threats like in far cry 3 and 4,   -ending buddy story also kinda sucks.   Buy it on sale			"

												It's not the violent slapstick and chain-splodes of the hysterically volatile camps, filled to the brim with ammo dumps and fuel tanks. It's not the moments of pure adrenalised catharsis, where, rifle in hand, you power through smoke and machinegun fire, enemies to the left and right. It's not even when you stride through the ruins, calmly putting down survivors by plunging a machete into their chests.No. Its appeal is in the moments beforehand - when, from some lofty perch, you think of what's to come. You check your ammo. You reload your weapons. You heal up. You anticipate. It is the calm before the storm. You are the match before the flame. In the most player-centric world yet created, in a game that you know is about to surprise, delight and enthral you, standing still, waiting to strike, is one of the finest pleasures you can experience.After playing Far Cry 2, I'm simply unable to go back to straight and simple first-person shooters. This game has executed my expectations. Would you, could you, go back to games with similar gunfights as this, but along a more rigid axis? I think your own expectations are going to rise dramatically. And I think you really should play this game.			"

												  Hi everyone! Go to my profile to check out some of my helpful reviews!  Far Cry 2 is honestly the most realistic game I've ever played. Imagine Insurgency with missions and a good storyline. Mainly, all you have to do is start out fighting for one client, and from there you collect more, in which you get more missions, in which you get more resources.  The map is a greatly sized one compared to other games'. You have a map and a GPS to always use, that directs you to certain missions. Many of these are made to let the player use his/her own style, such as stealth, agressive, defence, or just plain old sniper from a long distance. The system of the stealth is mostly featuring missions like save the hostage, kill all the men without having a specific one notice, or taking/stealing a certain object smoothly. I, for example, on the hostage mission, enjoy going in, silent as possible, not being detected, killing some guards without the others noticing, and then saving the hostage. Then I shoot everthing.    The graphics are fantastic, as well as the multiplayer function, though my favorite is single player. The gameplay is tricky and fun at the same time, as well as the enemies (AI Units) are actually intelligent! This suprised me, when I tried to headshot one, missed, and they ran in different directions, to good cover, and one behind the hostage.    Also, the cars and planes are very well made. It is so realistic! No crosshairs in the game, no big texts on the top, but it just looks like you are looking from a first person view in real life. Another neat feature is the diamond GPS, where you can detect where hidden diamonds are and use them to trade for weaponry and other important goods that will need to be used to survive. My favorite part is that... "

												- When you can barely see the enemy with a sniper rifle, they can shoot you with a shotgun from there.- When you kill the enemy with a silent sniper rifle, with a camo suit, in a field where long-grasses cover you, still some guys can come near to you with a truck and they know exactly where you are.- When you get out of your safe house, almost always two guys come to you with a truck and start shooting.- Everybody is an enemy.Except these, the game is nearly perfect.Maybe it's a little bit hardcore than the others but probably the best Far Cry ever.

												Before reviewing this amazing game, I decided to play it for quite a while. As of the time I am writing this, I have two hours. Most of my reviews haven't been helpful, and I really want this one to help people geniunely decide if this is a game they want to invest in or not. Let's start off with the basics. Intro So you start up the game, and click new game. There are 9 characters to choose from, each from different nationalities with different voices, buddies (which I will go into detail of later), and ages. All the characters are male, though. Difficulty Levels There are 4 difficulty levels. Easy, Normal, Hard, And Infamous. On to the next thing.. Unscripted Player-Driven Events! Unfortunately for modern gaming, this is something most new games lack. Far Cry 2 is great for this kind of thing. Something I Found on IGNMarty dragged me out of the line of fire and into the bushes when a random group of guys jumped me on the road. Stupid. You never take the road. A gunner on the back of a truck mowed me down while I fell into my own misplaced Molotov flames. Marty hands me a pistol and opens fire. I find a couple grenades, knock the truck around, and finish the job. When it’s all done, I hear Marty screaming for help. I can’t see him.By the time I find his blue smoke streaming out of the woods, he’s grunting incoherently. I kneel down, jab a regenerative needle into his stomach, and wait for him to head home. He doesn’t get up. He’s still wounded, so I put another needle in him. Nothing, but he slows down, and his eyes roll upward. One more needle. Marty’s head hits the ground, and he stops squirming.I overdosed my best friend.Something that happened to me in game (Not IGN)When I was playing Far Cry 2, I was crouched behind a car. I fired off a few shots at a guy, and he was killed. I realised something; I was wounded! As my health was rapidly pouring away, I quickly healed myself, but while I was doing that, my car exploded and fell on me. Instant death.On to gameplay and stuff! Gameplay The gameplay is quite hard. If you are a newcomer and download the RealMode mod and play on Infamous difficulty for the first run of the game? You will die. A lot. You might die even without the mod. This game is BLOODY HARD AS ****.  Pick up a enemy weapon? Well prepare for it to be unreliable as hell. Snipers explode in your arms without any notice, guns jam, deal less damage... Recoil is a whole different thing. With weapons you purchase at the gun shops, they will do more damage, accuracy, etc. They also have a permanent ""good"" condition. However, firearms you ""borrow"" from your dead enemies, are quite the opposite; With inferior range, accuracy, and damage.  Wrap Up & Conclusion This game has its pros and cons..PROS- Amazing openworld experience- Great fun- Is pretty old and still looks amazing- Supports mods- Player driven eventsCONS- wtf is a con there is none buy this gameAll in all... BUY THIS DAMN GAME RIGHT NOW			"

												After many hours of stabbing my way through Farcrys 3 and 4, i was overall pleased with the changes made to the gameplay in those titles. Smoother, polished gameplay and greatly enhanced driving is what i enjoyed most about 3 and 4. They are great games, but they also felt like fantasy stories at times. That is why Farcry 2, in my opinion, shines above them.Gritty combat in a dark war torn nation is part of why this game is still the best in the series. Everything just feels so real. If one of your buddies die, tough ♥♥♥♥, he/she is gone forever. Malaria and jammed weapons make this game even more unforgiving. Shooting up an enemy checkpoint to steal their ammo and meds is also a little unsettling when you later see a guy on the ground, bleeding and screaming about how he wants to go home, but he can olny watch as you come crouch next to him and put a bullet in his head. The setting and feel is perfect, and the gameplay follows suit.Simply put, Farcry 2 is a game that requires strategy and patience, which is a great change of pace from the usual FPS realm. An interesting variety of weapons and a storyline that holds more than meets the eye make this game one of a kind. Replay value is very high, considering the unpredictability of the AI, the enviroment, and also how you choose to approach each mission. A satisfiying one man army experience is felt when played on hardcore or infamous difficulty. Ignite the conflict. Make them fear you. 9/10--To get the most out of this game and bring it to its true potential, i HIGHLY recommend installing Dylan's realism mod and sproyd's enhanced graphics mod, both of which are easy to install and can be found at moddb.com-- "

												If you love open world, mission based FPS then you will love Far Cry 2. It is worth every penny especially if you bought this on sale. The game itself is challenging because of the enemy AI. I recommend newbies to unlock Dragunov or AS50 as soon as possible by completing side quest missions. Fighting at a distance and preparation is the key in this game because no matter how powerful your shotgun or assault rifle is, you will get slaughtered by the AI. They love to flank and hide behind bushes and walls. The game is very realistic so it doesn't have an enemy indicator like most games which makes the enemies hard to see in jungle and grassy settings. Don't expect the game to make it easy for you just because you are a beginner.			"

												This is a great game. Graphics, gunplay, story and just wondering in the middle of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere are all great things to do. It would be one of the greatest games i've ever played... if it wasnt for that stupid ♥♥♥♥ing glitch that makes it impossible to move on with the game, ♥♥♥♥ that glitch. Ubisoft showed us again that they will make great games but they will ♥♥♥♥ it up. They promissed they would patch it in 2009. It's 2014 and i doubt they will ever patch it.If you are careful you wont have a problem with it. thats the real problem though. WIth a game like farcry the last thing i want to do is be careful. I want to run in with my flamthrower and set everyone on fire. I want to find the tallest point in the game and drive a car off the edge, I recommed this game because the game is amazing. It is so realist that you actually pull out a map to look at it and it wont pause the game. i felt i was in Africa killing people. Not sure if thats good or bad but it sure as hell is fun. Get this game, worth it without a doubt but make sure that you dont get the game ending glitch, you can spend 20 hours and not even know that you wont be able to countiue. Its the best worst geme. You spend hours playing and and doing things and then the game wont let you move on. It gives you the pleasure to play it and then when youre addicted to it, it takes it away from you... Get it but know you might have to restart... Also ♥♥♥♥ ubisoft. Patch the ♥♥♥♥ing game FC3 is fun yes and FC4 probably will too but fix your ♥♥♥♥ up. It is so painful for a game as great as this to have such a fatal flaw.			"

												REally great game! I played FC3 first and loved it so much I wanted to play the previous game and was amazed that it is just as good (except the lack of hunting animals to upgrade stuff despite there being animals in FC2.) You have plenty of awesome guns to buy after finding diamons hidden all over the place and a few vehicles and boats to drive around in. It is a few years old so Its not as diverse and in depth as the more current titles but its gameplay makes up for it.			"

												For start offs this game Far Cry 2 is good value for money, especcially on sale. I clocked over 54 hours on it and there still side missions available or buddy missions. This Game seemed to get a lot of bad press when it came out and in a way thats a reason i avoided it until a month ago. This bad press was unfair in my view, theres a good game in there if you give it a chance. The gunplay is quite good with the added feature of your guns jamming through aging or general abuse, no other game has that feature i have ever seen. This feature actually adds to a firefight when you are in the middle of one in the adrenaline rush to get your gun back up and running. The graphics for a 2008 game are reallly good too and the African countryside of Savannah, desert and jungle are spectacular looking. This open world feature is one of the games strongpoints. I didnt have any real complaints about the game other than mercenary checkpoints do respawn after you clear them out but its no real issue. The Dialogue in the game can go very fast sometimes too.This is an underrated game and for the price is definitley good value.			"

												So I have read some reviews on this one where some don't care for the respawning guardposts, the weapons degrading, the ""tedious"" driving, the side missions, your character having malaria, etc? Well, as far as I am conserned, that's what makes this game fun, and challenging. I have played this on Infamous, and let me tell you, if you thought playing on Master in Farcry 3 was hard(I personally thought it was a cakewalk), Infamous is a whole ball of wax;but there is a way to beat this on Infamous-Just get some stealth weapons from one of the weapon shops, get to a safehouse, change from daylight to dark, don't run at all(the guards will be able to hear you, even from long distances), and it's all easy pickens. Anyways, there's my review. This is Farcry 2. Welcome to Africa.			"

												What sets this apart from other shooters is the overall theme. Everything feels honest and real, from the syrettes and the malaria to the politics and ultimately the narrative. Without spoiling anything, I'll say your mission from the beginning is to take out an arms dealer, but as you get acquainted with other characters it becomes something much more. No matter which character you play as, you aren't a hero — you're not even a remotely good guy. As the story progresses you will come to terms with that fact, and how you deal with it is entirely up to you. By the end this game delivers a very powerful message. I really like the open world and how missions can be completed in many different ways, both by teaming up with the NPC buddies (optional) and also by learning the enemies' realisitc AI. Enemies react differently based on the weather, time of day, which weapons you're using, etc. It's a really deep system if you want to learn all the ins and outs. Otherwise just play it like any other game and it's still fun. There's a lot of variety in the landscape: jungles, plains, mountains, deserts, etc. There's also a lot of detail: Blades of grass part realistically when you sneak through fields. Hang gliders are a great way to travel and provide some amazing scenic views along the way. The Act 2 map is just as large as the Act 1 map, which I thought was already large enough for the entire game to take place in. That was a really great surprise. The Fortune's DLC adds a lot of new side missions to complete whenever you want to work on them, which add a lot of lore to what's going on in the war torn country. It also adds a little ATV which is by far the fastest means of getting around, and a crossbow which shoots incendiary arrows that explode on impact. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed every hour of Far Cry 2. I found it to be much more immersive than the first game. It still looks great today, and now that Far Cry 3 is out the price is really low!

												Far Cry 2 heavily expands the appealing, basic formula established in Far Cry 1. I would call it the first modern Far Cry game since most of the hallmark Far Cry features come into their own in this title. The core of a Far Cry/Crysis game is fast paced, streamlined, semi-realistic, immersive first person military shooter in large open environments where the player is free to explore multiple approaches (stealth, close range assault, sniping, explosives, vehicles, turrets, or any combination thereof) to overcoming enemies. Far Cry 2 also introduces a large open-world, non-linear mission system with multiple factions, weapon and equipment unlocks, safe houses and buddy companion-system. The central african environments are breathtaking and the game takes great pains to immerse the player in the environment. The HUD is incredibly minimal with most actions and situations being context sensitive and told through actual interaction with the environment. For example, rather than healing being simply invisible (the health bar just refills), you'll see your character inject a syrette in his/her forearm, reset a broken limb, or pull a bullet from a gaping wound in their leg. The map just doesn't appear on the HUD, you actually pull a physical map and GPS out. When your character suffers the affects of malaria, you're vision will blur and turn green and you'll have to pull out a pill bottle and swallow a pill to counter-act the effects. All these things effectively serve to immerse the player in the world, but don't inhibit gameplay. The enemy AI is also very sophisticated and will communicate with one another, actively hunt for you and attempt to surround you (or where they think you are), or even get scared and take cover or run. My primary grievance is that random encounters when traveling can be a bit to frequent and bypassing frequent road blocks and guard posts can get to be a grinding chore in traveling around the map.The mission system that unveils the story is fun and engrossing. The story is not just handed to you, but the player will have to really pay attention if they want to figure out what is really going on. The interplay of the factions, the player, and their buddies is fascinating and keeps the game fresh from start to finish. The side missions do get a bit redundant though, which include destroy arm shipments, and assassinations. Luckily, the core Far Cry gun play is solid and doesn't get old quickly. It is fun when a situation goes from you getting a jump on a bunch of enemies to reinforcements showing up and surrounding you as you run short on ammo and having to fight for your life to break the encirclement and make a run for it. Which brings me to the buddy system which is rich and unrivaled in any FPS/RPG that I have seen. The system is rather organic and you really seem to build a relationship and history with your buddies who are fellow mercenaries try to profit in this little civil war.All in all, there are few games I can safely recommend as must plays for anyone, but this is definitely one of them.

												Far Cry 2 was a bold game, and the perfect example of a diamond in the rough, if you will.After the original highly-acclaimed game set the players up in an exotic tropical locale and had them face up against mutants and various other assorted enemies, the sequel instead drops them in an Unnamed African Country where the worst monster is man. Finding themselves in the midst of a civil war between two warring factions, the player is hired to kill the Jackal, an arms dealer supplying both factions with weapons and thus fuelling the furnace. However, things go awry, the player contacts malaria and are caught in a crossfire they barely escape from. Penniless, weaponless and without any contacts, they will need to work their way up on the 'social ladder' if they are to reach their end goal.If there's two words that would describe Far Cry 2 perfectly, they would be 'world building'. The game actually manages to make the prospect of trudging through a dull, brown African country interesting, simply because of all the small details the game throws at you. As mentioned before, the PC is sick with malaria and must take pills regularly, even if a crisis hits him in the middle of a firefight, or his symptoms will worsen and make it even more difficult to do anything effectively. The game's currency takes on the form of rough diamonds, which are received as payment for missions, but also can be found in briefcases scattered throughout the UAC. These diamonds can then be used to pay for new weapons, upgrades and other improvements such as increased ammo capacity.And speaking of weapons, the dusty, hostile climate of Africa does not bode well for their condition. Weapons will start degrading in quality almost as soon as they're fired, and begin gathering rust. If they're rusty enough they'll jam while being fired and the PC will need to unjam them in the middle of the fight, again adding to the tension of any confrontation. Ultimately, if the weapon is not replaced, it might just explode in your hands, rendering you defenseless until you switch to another weapon or pick one up off of a fallen foe. Weapon variety should also be mentioned, going from Desert Eagles to the M79 to a Japanese mortar, a rifle that fires darts and a few light machineguns, to say a few names.The AI of the enemies is more than decent and will surprise you more often than not. You will constantly be flanked as they shout orders to one another and will need to act fast, as cover will not be the be-all end-all of a fight. However, it does suffer from the occasional hiccup, but then again, which game doesn't? (Except FEAR.) Something should also be said about the vehicles on offer, most of them having been refitted with mounted weapons which can be used by switching to the respective seat. Vehicles do get damaged when shot, but the PC can repair them by simply opening up the hood and...twisting a bolt with a ratchet. Huh. Maybe he's just the second coming of Bob the Builder. The buddy system also gets an honourable mention. The PC can meet several other foreign mercenaries, like himself, along the game, and they can give him alternate objectives for some missions or even rescue him when he falls, but once they take too much damage they'll need rescuing themselves, and once they die, they're gone forever. Their personalities and backgrounds are also fairly varied and they'll even talk about and to each other.While all this may sound perfect, there are several somewhat obvious faults with the game. First and foremost, everyone always attacks you outside of the designated ceasefire zones. This is explained as the PC being sent on secret missions by both factions, so the militia in the field wouldn't know his purpose, so that can be somewhat glossed over, or modded out. However, that complaint doesn't mix well with the next, that enemies will respawn on every cleared guard post, even if you only walked some 100 meters away. This can get annoying really quickly as you'll have to blaze the entirety of the map sometimes (which isn't incredibly large, but is varied), wading right through several guard posts you'd previously cleared, only to have to stop at each of them and kill the new enemies so you don't risk getting shot in the back as you're leaving. Another chief complaint is the Hivemindedness of the AI and the fact that they can see through the thickest of foliages. This could be passable if the one enemy that spots you would have to shout out for his comrades first, but that doesn't happen. The moment you're seen, everyone in the location knows where you are, and WILL fire in your general direction, even if you're hiding in tall grass.To add to that complaint, the stealth system is wonky and usually doesn't work because of the last fact. There are a few options for stealth, which is even encouraged on the last difficulty setting, including the Machete you always wield. However, a full stealth playthrough is nigh impossible unless you hit 100% of your bullets, because the moment you miss and the bullet whizzes past that one guard's ear, he will turn straight at you and try to murder you, together with all six of his buddies.Finally, the game is fairly bug-free, except for several annoying bugs that halt mission progress and are a pain to get through.To finish up this needlessly long review, I would recommend Far Cry 2 if you're looking for a different experience to most other FPS games. It might not seem like it, but it is a breath of fresh, dry, hot air in the genre. Most of my complaints can most likely be fixed by way of mods as well, so, give it a try!			"

												This is one of the greatest FPS ever crafted.Even overlooking the original setting, there's 2 giant maps to explore and a lot of hidden diamonds. The respawning checkpoints are a bit annoying, but so it would be an FPS with no shooting on it. You can deal with them in a variety of situations, from run-and-gunning, throwing molotovs from afar, mortar shelling, or strapping IED to trucks and jumping from them in the nick of time. Or use the fixed weapons on the vehicles. Or glide into battle.			"

												This is a great game. Graphics, gunplay, story and just wondering in the middle of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere are all great things to do. It would be one of the greatest games i've ever played... if it wasnt for that stupid ♥♥♥♥ing glitch that makes it impossible to move on with the game, ♥♥♥♥ that glitch. Ubisoft showed us again that they will make great games but they will ♥♥♥♥ it up. They promissed they would patch it in 2009. It's 2014 and i doubt they will ever patch it.If you are careful you wont have a problem with it. thats the real problem though. WIth a game like farcry the last thing i want to do is be careful. I want to run in with my flamthrower and set everyone on fire. I want to find the tallest point in the game and drive a car off the edge, I recommed this game because the game is amazing. It is so realist that you actually pull out a map to look at it and it wont pause the game. i felt i was in Africa killing people. Not sure if thats good or bad but it sure as hell is fun. Get this game, worth it without a doubt but make sure that you dont get the game ending glitch, you can spend 20 hours and not even know that you wont be able to countiue. Its the best worst geme. You spend hours playing and and doing things and then the game wont let you move on. It gives you the pleasure to play it and then when youre addicted to it, it takes it away from you... Get it but know you might have to restart... Also ♥♥♥♥ ubisoft. Patch the ♥♥♥♥ing game FC3 is fun yes and FC4 probably will too but fix your ♥♥♥♥ up. It is so painful for a game as great as this to have such a fatal flaw.			"

												Far Cry 2 has nothing in common with its predecessor other than the huge open world that characterised the first game, as well. In fact, the first episode was rather linear (practically, each level was a different island) whereas here you can go wherever you want. There are two maps with an enormous amount of territory to be covered. Just look at the pictures posted on the store page to see how beautiful and varied these areas are. As already stated, the game is beautiful. The jungles, the rain, the burning grass and trees (pyromaniacs will love it) once you obtain a flamethrower. It is just gorgeous! Too bad the story does not hold anything special in it. You complete missions for two competing factions that try to rule the area. If I'm mistaken this is all fictional and there's not even a mention as to which African country you are in.The game is very difficult. Even on a normal difficulty enemies you pass by in a vehicle can shoot you from a distance - I'm amazed how precise shots they have each time. If you go through a single outpost it is almost impossible to do that without being hit by the enemies. Another issue is how the enemies in these outposts throughout the game get respawned for no apparent reason. Mission destination points are usually deliberately placed to the farthest place on the map making sure you need to go through at least a couple of outposts along the way. This is bad as the game is prolonged due to some unnecessary, repetitive actions. Still, overall, this is a good game. It is entertaining and you can have some really funny moments during the combat with enemies. If you are not familiar with the franchise, however, I think the best is to choose the 3rd episode which is a more refined version of the Far Cry experience. "

												There are three kinds of enemies that can kill you in this game: malaria (doesn't really kill you, but will knock you out cold if a symptom attack catches you without the much needed pills), blood-thirsty mercenaries just like yourself (who duke it out supporting dubious causes for a hefty payment in blood diamonds), and the CoD-ey, impatient, quicktime-event-trained, short-attention-span mentality you WILL have when you first boot up Far Cry 2. All the past years, games in the likes of Call of Duty, Medal of Honor et al. have all created a FPS playerbase with a tremendously short focus of attention, a shocking lack of thinking and planning tactics, and a complete disregard of taking your mind off the shootybanging going on in the foreground, in order to soak in the atmosphere in the background. Far Cry 2 is, apart from a solid shooter, a magnificent atmospheric game, full of engrossing ambience and breathtaking vistas that will provide with a cheap vacation alternative to sub-Saharan Africa, albeit in a much more hostile environment than you would ever wish for. The nature that surrounds you can be both an ally and an enemy if you don't treat it properly, as a vantage point you used meticulously to pick off guards in a distant outpost can become a death trap at any moment, should a raging wildfire cut off any escape routes. Propagating bushfire mechanics can be harnessed to cause chaos and mayhem to enemy positions, but can also uncontrollably harm your character as well. Getting from point A to point B in this game can seem tedious at first, as you will have to walk or drive to wherever you need to be, but as you get more and more used to the feel of the adventure, you will discover alternate routes, shortcuts and safe zones to better facilitate your travelling needs.Don't expect fauna to be a threat, or to have any intelligence. Grazing herbivores are all you are ever going to see, and zebras tend to one-bump-one-kill themselves on your car, even if you are fully stopped. A full time-of-day cycle and dynamic weather effects will paint a much more convincing picture of your surroundings as you comb through the map length- and widthwise.TL;DR- An incredible experience worth the price of admission, it is a must that you should not overlook, especially since it goes dirt-cheap on sales more often than you would change underwear.

I got to play Far Cry 2 again with family sharing and It just reminds me how far Far Cry has come since the first entry into the series. Far Cry 2 hold true to this pattern being a good stepping stone for Far Cry fans and newcomers like to experience all Far Cry has to offer. No matter what far cry you like most be it, Far Cry, Instincts, Evolution, Predator, Vengeance. Paradise lost, 2, 3, or Blood Dragon you have to admit Far Cry 2 is a decent entry into the series.

												Far Cry 2 throws the player into the wild African savannah where you have to fend for yourself. No one is there to hold your hand, and the world offers limitless opportunities. Problem is, you have caught malaria and you are in the middle of a civil war. As a mercenary, you offer your services to the various warlords as you drift ever closer into the dangerous conflict.If you enjoyed the first Far Cry, you will probably find Far Cry 2 quite enjoyable as well. While not related story-wise, the game offers a similar tone in gameplay. The game gives you the freedom to roam a massive world set in Africa. And there is no doubt in saying that the world is gorgeous, yet this is also where one of the most fundamental flaws lies. The world is sparsely populated; there are no massive cities, villages, or interesting locations to visit in the game. The world mainly consists of outposts with 100% goon density. This shallow attention to detail is what makes Far Cry 2 quite repetitive once you hit the 10 hour mark. An impressive addition to Far Cry 2 is the durability of weapons. Unlike most FPS games, the weapons in Far Cry 2 can jam or completely break in the middle of a fight. This makes pre-mission planning much more fun as it promotes the idea of checking the weapon state. Yet this “realism” that Far Cry 2 so heavily promotes can be a pain at times. Your character contracts malaria early in the game, and forces you to do boring side-missions to acquire 1-4 pills. Depending on how long you play, you may have to do quite a few of those malaria quests. It is also bothersome as symptoms may show up in the middle of a firefight.As for story, Far Cry 2 follows in the footsteps of the first Far Cry in that it doesn’t provide an interesting plot at all. The characters are poorly voiced and uninteresting, the plot never really develops, and you could care less what is happening around you. It becomes quite apparent after a few hours that the budget went straight into developing the world and not the story or its characters. At times, you may feel extremely lonely in this intimidating setting.Overall, if you like a sandbox playstyle with goons who will make life hell for you as you try to traverse the African terrains, then this game should be plenty of fun. Even if you don’t plan to play the main mission, go raid some outposts. I found it quite entertaining. Score: 7/10 "

												Let me be as brutally honest as possible, as I'm only given two choices of ""Yes"" and ""No"" it's hard to pin point where I stand on this game. Pros: - Something to do with the story, I don't really care about story, too busy shooting things and exploring- Lots of things to do- Good gunplay- Good graphics for it's time, and even still good (to me) todayCons: (and boy, do i have a lot of these)- Respawning guard posts, I know Ubisofts main intention for the respawning guard posts was to make it so that you always had something to do, but when cars are oh so very easily damaged, it's a massive slow down when you can't actually just drive through a base without getting your car shot out by one or two guys- Enemy AI, Don't get me wrong, it's funny to hear them say ""I saw atleast 3 guys"" over and over, but when your trying to be sneaky, and enemies can see you through random bits of foiliage, but you can't see them, that's a tad bit unfair, a minor set back- The sheer mass of the game, the map is absolutely MASSIVE or maybe it just feels that way due to the fact that it takes ages to get anywhere, paired with the fact that stamina isn't unlimited, makes the exploration factor take a painful amount of time to do. Take this scenario, you don't know that there is one specific part that links the south part of the map with the north (as if the north part wasn't big enough) you take your buggy over to the north part, expecting to be able to get there, but alas, your character passes out and you can't. it respawns you without a vehicle, and you have to spend the next 15 minutes walking to find a randomly spawning enemy car. It has happened to me, it's probably happened to you, and if it hasn't, consider yourself VERY lucky.I could go on, and I may seem to be very heavy on the cons, and not so heavy on the pros, but believe me when I say this, this game has it's moments, it's quite fun, i enjoy it, if it weren't for the MASSIVE amount of driving that you had to do, and respawning guard outposts, this would be the perfect game, and I think i speak for a lot of people, because far cry 3? It's basically what i just described, Ubisoft agrees with it, and the vast populi of people who have played the far series agree with it.			"

Since most won't like the game, I'll discuss the good points first.Far Cry 2 drops your mercenary hide into an ongoing civil war between 2 factions in a war-torn African country, your objective is to hunt ""the Jackal"", the infamous arms dealer that arms both sides and thus, is fueling the war. The thing about the story is that it's actually not bad. The plot is heavily inspired by Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, the resulting focus on barbarism and morality is clearly evident. The game has an interesting approach to realism, the attention to detail is amazing. Your gun can jam in the middle of a firefight, performing the clearing drill around enemies creates a new level of tension. Fire is caused by anything flammable, molotovs, propane tanks, exploding cars, etc. And it propagates beautifully, better than in Far Cry 3 even. Your minimap is made of paper and you physically pull it out whenever you want to check it, it baffles me why no other game does this to improve immersion. Heck, even the plants bend when you step or drive over them, you can shoot the branches off trees too. A grenade will send pieces of a shed and the surrounding shrub flying, revealing the skeletal famework and anybody inside that is still alive. The AI is not perfect, they sometimes take turns to be impressively stupid and annoyingly sharp. But once combat starts, they yell updates at each other to coordinate flanks and comb the jungle for you when you are in hiding. At first, you will flounder around the map, attracting the attention of every enemy you meet, a frustrating and demoralizing experience. Slowly, you understand the quirks of the stealth system, you unlock guns which compliment your playstyle, you discover the value of always moving in a firefight. You grow fearless and become feared. You learn how to shoot to wound instead of kill, so that you may silently watch their comrades run out of cover to rescue their buddy and take them both out. As your reputation grows, soldiers in the cease fire areas no longer arrogantly push you away when you run up to them, instead, they mutter fearful apologies and back off. Sometimes, in combat, they will panic and scream about how they just want to go home. As your character uses his machete to execute the wounded soldier on the ground, you realise that the game's mechanics have turned you into the monster you were supposed to kill.Alongside that, an ingenious game mechanic is the buddy system. The game randomly assigns you buddies from a lengthy roster. Most of the time, you will be helping them run errands or get taken along by one of their crazy ideas to complicate the central mission. However, imagine this scenario: you attempt a raid and something goes wrong, a PMC flanked you from the tall grass to your right and you go down in bursts of shotgun fire. Your grow frustrated at the idea of restarting the attack, but then Josip, your hilarious, middle-aged Algerian buddy appears onscreen. He drags you to safety as you recall the time he got you to kill a car dealer for him because ""Turns out car is piece of ♥♥♥♥ - so *he* is piece of ♥♥♥♥"" and then awkwardly uses the word ""cool"" with a thumbs up and cheesy grin. You dig out the bullet from your forearm, the two of you re-enter the fray. However, assault truck pulls up. it's full of enemies and the machinegun on the vehicle sprays at both of you. You dive for cover and take it out with a grenade, only to see your buddy squirming on the ground. You move over to him and give him a morphine jab, expecting him to spring back to life just like before. But this time, he gurgles for more. With realization dawning, you give him another jab, his reply is the same. Now you have no more morphine and a dying buddy in pain. The game prompts you to unholster your pistol and you place it in his mouth. He even thanked you before you pulled the trigger. This is the way you get players to care.Unfortunately, those things only happen when the stars are aligned and the game plays as intended. The unfortunate reality is that in order for your emergent interactions with the militia to occur, the game throws them at you around every corner. This makes traversing the 50 square kilometers of the open world a serious hassle even when you master the art of finding paths of least resistance and take the bus whenever possible. Although it is highly satisfying to sneaking through a village to silence a high value target, it is just as likely that while sneaking through the town, the PMC on the platform at the other end of the town spots you with predator vision and blasts you with his RPG. Usually, stealth plans are thwarted midway because one missed shot from any silenced weapon alerts the whole camp to your position and they will almost instantly fire upon you from wherever they are. Using the machete is also, strangely, not a silenced kill. Making it useless expect in finishing off wounded enemies. I suppose Far Cry 3's magical teleporting knife instakills are an upgrade. The map design also causes fits whenever you encounter a steep cliff that blocks your safe shortcut to the objective. It makes you wish for helicopter travel or at least the ability to climb.Another unfortunate thing is the mission variety, although you are free to tackle them they are confined to 3 types. Assassination/intimidation missions where you either kill or force people to do things and maybe kill them afterwards. Sabotage/retrieval missions where you destroy or steal objects which are in a village filled with PMCs. Last is the convoy ambush, which is exactly what it sounds like. The last type usually only applies to the arms vendor missions which you complete to unlock the possibility of buying new weapons. So for most of the game you will be contending with the first 2. There are only so many ways to skin a cat and nearing the end, missions have the same draggy expectation as a fetch quest. When combined with the frustratingly long and tedious travel, you can see why this game was a major disappointment for many.The frustrations are slightly reduced with modding, Dylan's mod makes weapons much deadlier, increases the ammunition count, improves the effectiveness of your camouflaged suit, reduces the frequency of malaria attacks and jams as well as the chances of being chased when running through a checkpoint along with many other tweaks. As a result, you are more vulnerable and your gameplay will have even more tension. It's a good thing you have an extra life thanks to your buddy. I would advise to play it modded on the highest difficulty even on your first try because all is fair when you can usually down enemies with one round from any gun. Try to avoid conflict as much as possible and save very often, because you may die from ridiculous circumstances. That's all I have to say.			"

												Let's face it, nowadays, we only play this for the sheer pleasure of burning the dry plains of Africa. 90% of my time spent in this game is spent just burning things because it looks cool.I'm sure if I ever get tired of turning Africa into an ash tray, I'll discover a great storyline.

												I played this game when it came out and I must say that although I was very impressed with the game at first, it soon became boring and repetitive.The mission structure is very similar-basically go and blow something up or free somebody etc.Characters are shallow and not interesting.The world seems kind of empty with nothing much to do than destroying camps and dealing with very annoying armored jeeps that follow you when you pass by.Now 5 years later I bought a new powerful graphic card,found some great mods and decided to give it another go.I must say that I'm very pleased with the game.What this game gives you is very unique experience and that is enough to cover all it's flaws.This game made me realise what I've long forgotten.It's that not everything has to be action packed,flashy story,indepth customization of everything,points,cover system....It's just simple and beautiful.It makes you appreciate the time spent just roaming the wilderness with nothing on your screen to destract you from beautiful world around you.Total immersion.We need to stop with consuming games like an always hungry fat kid and appreciate the atmosphere and experience.You will often feel alone and kind of lost in this great world,which coupled with an amazing weather system,beautiful graphics and fitting background music makes the experience very unique.Sometimes it feels like a dream to me.Like you never really know what is going on but you just exist,just to watch that beautiful sunset.It gives you time for thinking between action parts.And action is great and the whole weapon system is designed very well.From buying,upgrading to the shooting mechanics and wearing out including great jamming system and animations.The arsenal is also pretty big with plenty to choose from.The other thing that shines is AI.Although they can act like idiots at times mostly they are smart and they will very often surprise you and flank you.They will also detect you quickly even if you just peak out behind cover to take a quick look.Just like IRL,they are not blind like in other games (Hitman:Absolution for eg) and there is no ""detection meter"".If they see you, they see you.Your best bet for sneaking is to attack by night wearing stealth suit and even then it will not be easy,because if you are too close they will hear louder sounds such as bumping in objects or reloading etc. and come to investigate.GREAT STEALTH GAME right there.Using quick save and quick load is much recommended.As I don't want to write a book here I will conclude and tell you to try it if you are looking for a trully open world game with a great action,juicy explosions and shooting,GREAT STEALTH possibilities and an amazing atmosphere.You will love Africa after this,or hate it.Whatever.What you will not find is many RPG elements and a great story.But lack of those gives the game its charm and keeps the focus on other things.WHAT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND is getting this mods from moddb:sproyds_FC2_SweetFX_config and VERY important DylansFC2Mod1.4 as it will basically fix the game.Just check it out even if you don't like mods(like me)Play on highest difficulty and enjoy!

												Let me be as brutally honest as possible, as I'm only given two choices of ""Yes"" and ""No"" it's hard to pin point where I stand on this game. Pros: - Something to do with the story, I don't really care about story, too busy shooting things and exploring- Lots of things to do- Good gunplay- Good graphics for it's time, and even still good (to me) todayCons: (and boy, do i have a lot of these)- Respawning guard posts, I know Ubisofts main intention for the respawning guard posts was to make it so that you always had something to do, but when cars are oh so very easily damaged, it's a massive slow down when you can't actually just drive through a base without getting your car shot out by one or two guys- Enemy AI, Don't get me wrong, it's funny to hear them say ""I saw atleast 3 guys"" over and over, but when your trying to be sneaky, and enemies can see you through random bits of foiliage, but you can't see them, that's a tad bit unfair, a minor set back- The sheer mass of the game, the map is absolutely MASSIVE or maybe it just feels that way due to the fact that it takes ages to get anywhere, paired with the fact that stamina isn't unlimited, makes the exploration factor take a painful amount of time to do. Take this scenario, you don't know that there is one specific part that links the south part of the map with the north (as if the north part wasn't big enough) you take your buggy over to the north part, expecting to be able to get there, but alas, your character passes out and you can't. it respawns you without a vehicle, and you have to spend the next 15 minutes walking to find a randomly spawning enemy car. It has happened to me, it's probably happened to you, and if it hasn't, consider yourself VERY lucky.I could go on, and I may seem to be very heavy on the cons, and not so heavy on the pros, but believe me when I say this, this game has it's moments, it's quite fun, i enjoy it, if it weren't for the MASSIVE amount of driving that you had to do, and respawning guard outposts, this would be the perfect game, and I think i speak for a lot of people, because far cry 3? It's basically what i just described, Ubisoft agrees with it, and the vast populi of people who have played the far series agree with it.			"

												Far Cry 2 is another sandbox game that allows you to explore the terrain and kick some ♥♥♥, but has a number of flaws that may turn some gamers off. First and foremost, their is an outstanding DX10 flaw that causes stuttering frames for some users (search for the workaround). As for the gameplay, Far Cry 2 does not feature a rich story in any sense and the enemy NPCs can become annoying with their over deadly accuracy and constant respawning. Still, Far Cry 2 is great for some freelance warfare especially given its detailed open-world environment.			"

												It seems like the Far Cry series gets better and better with each entry. I got to play Far Cry 2 again with family sharing and It just reminds me how far Far Cry has come since the first entry into the series. Far Cry 2 hold true to this pattern being a good stepping stone for Far Cry fans and newcomers like to experience all Far Cry has to offer. No matter what far cry you like most be it, Far Cry, Instincts, Evolution, Predator, Vengeance. Paradise lost, 2, 3, or Blood Dragon you have to admit Far Cry 2 is a decent entry into the series. Let us hope that Far Cry 4 will continue the trend of improvement and give us much joy with the next installment.         1/13/14			"

												Far Cry 2 is the Far cry 3 i always wanted. I know many people dislike this game; ""It is too hard"", ""there are no clear quest markers"", ""Its not obvious when enemies can see you"". But this game has certain realisms which, for a rising storm/RO2 fan, makes it more appealing.                       Certain features in this game make it just that bit better than the alternatives out there:+Your gun jamming when you have used it too many times. (With a nice rust effect to warn you prior)+Enemies don't just drop money, meaning that sometimes it is better NOT to kill all the lifeforms in a 30 mile radius.+There is a certain variety in the vehicle selection which i really like (The big white 'Tank' is truly a beast!)+Guns overheating, knife bouncing off hard targets; small features like this, and more, make the game beleivable.+You look at REAL maps instead of just  pausing and going to the menue, meaning you can look on the drive! All these features, at least for me, make this game probably the best in the trilogy, and i have played all excessivly (bar 4), and despite the malaria being a bit of a bummer, it is pleasant to have a character who isn't just super amazingly tough and perfect in every way.Would definitely reccomend buying, as long as you are more into 'realism' (as obviosly you can still soak up bullets like nobody else can).9.5/10			"

 Far Cry 2: Buy it! 
I am less than 10 h/ into the game, but I can say that it is worth however much money you get it for. The AI for the enemy's can be a little shaky, but for the most part you can actually use their purposly implemented features to your advantage. Scenerio example: 

You spot an enemy in the distance, in a base camp. Your mission objective is far away, yet you can't resist the urge to make your own fun in this barren wastland. You get a little closer, while still remaining in the bushes and shrubs, and you finaly get close enough to where you think you can make an accurate shot. You crouch down, take aim and fire at their shoulder. You hit, and the rest of the enemies remain clueless as to who fired the shot. They rush over to the wounded souldier, and as they get there you make a dash to get with close range, and take out 3 enemy's with your shotgun remaining unharmed and get behind cover before any other enemy's can get a shot off on you. 3 down, 2 more to get an easy advantage on using the same method with a little more run and gun.

The enemy's ""caring"" features as I would like to call them the feature I made a scenario about above. If you wound a souldier, or put one into a dangerous situation, if all goes well another souldier will move into the same general area, or go to the wounded souldier and help. This is a very cool feature that I like using, but you need to make sure that you are for enough away.

The different characters that you can play as all have a different initial spawning spot, which also means that your ""boss"" at the beggining has different traits (and of course different voice actors) which spices up the beggining of your game differently, which adds to replayability. Of course, I haven't played very far into the game on different characters so I can't confirm that the story/npc's that you meet later are different, but at least during the begining you can choose different characters to play as which gives different startings to the game. 

 Permadeath. Do it. Seriously. Permadeath is where if you die in game, you can't respawn. Well of course you still can, but if you are following the rules then you delete your save/all other saves corosponding with that character you are playing with. 

This game has a unique  buddy system , which can be fatal, and helpful. The more buddy's you have, the ""safer"" you will be. Your buddy's can save your A☻s, but sometimes can give you false hope, like if you only have one syrrette (morphine) left and you are at low health and your buddy is down, you can save them in the hopes that if you ""die"" that your buddy will rescue you, but your buddy is just as open to dangers as you are, and can die also. 

Syrrettes are morphine shots that restore your health to full, but you can only use them if you did the non syrrette heal, which is to hit the same key (H) and it will make your character do one of the dozens of healing animations, like biting a bullet out of your arm, using plyers to get a bullet out of your leg, pulling a peice of metal from your thigh, putting your arm back into it's socket, etc. which makes the game feel VERY realistic in the damage sence. Syrrettes are easily obtainable at safe houses, your ""boss's"" ""house"", enemy camps etc. but if you are constantly in the feild enjoying the open world aspect of the game, then you might run into trouble, esspecially if you are playing permadeath.

Some notes:

-If you steal an enemy car from a camp and another enemy sees you, they will engage.
-ALWAYS use a vehicle that has a mounted turret. It's as easy as hitting ""C"" to switch to the turret and within second you have a weapon that can be way more powerfull than your weapons that you carry.
-Make your own fun! Don't forget, this is an open world game. You can run around having fun and engaging in casual shennanigans alongside actually completing the game.

Anyways, you guys should 100% buy this game! It's worth it if you like unforgiving enemies, multiple ways of completing missions, having open world possibilities, and playing through older games (it was made in 2008). Enjoy! "

												If you look at my profile, you can see that I've spent the majority of my time playing this. It is the perfect game for when you want to have fun, but at a bit more relaxed pace than defeating a boss in another game. It is great fun to burn and blow stuff up and the story is pretty good also. At first, it is easy to get your butt kicked, but once you get some decent weapons it is fairly easy. I also LOVE the beautiful views and it's a way to get a dose of sun on a rainy day. The only real negative is the lack of wild animals like tigers, etc. but they fixed that in Far Cry 3. I still prefer this one though. Tip: try to grab a jeep with a grenade launcher because once you have that, you are almost immortal. The big assault truck is very effective also. And make use of the open space with a sniper rifle. I also found the dart gun to be very useful because you can kill like four guys before assaulting a checkpoint, greatly increasing your odds. The first one goes down and it lures other guards over. Muahaha!			"

												This game is a hidden treasure that all players must have in their collection. There is so much realism, so much detail, and so many more features than Far Cry. It's unbelievable how amazing this game is, and also how underplayed it is. I've heard people say that it differs too much from it's predecessor to be an official sequel. Although it's made on a different engine and has a surplus of extras not featured in Far Cry, the basic elements are still the same: shoot mercs in a sandbox world set in an exotic locale.If you never played Far Cry 1 and if you were to ask me I would say skip it entirely and get Far Cry 2. It has everything that most people would want in a game, with only minor annoyances. It's crazy how much detail is here: driveable vehicles, mounted guns, fixable cars, unlockable safe houses, weapon upgrades, uncontrollable wild fires, exciting action, riveting music, helpful allies, challenging AI, beautiful scenery, and to top it all off you have a bad case of malaria!

Good weapons, not bad gameplay, meh story (liked the ending though), bad and boring characters, ughh world. Not really much to do other than do the missions which is pretty bad for an open world, but it is still pretty good:9/10			"

												Worth playing for the first 10 hours or so, it's really great fun during that initial period.The gunplay is great and the touches of realism are well executed for the most part, which combined with the well designed gameworld, all leads to a very nice sense of immersion.Unfortunately after a while the game becomes extremely repetitive with pretty much only three types of missions, two of them being identical each time around (the gunshop and assassination ones), whereas the main story missions are also all very similar.Some questionable design choices also really get in the way of allowing you to have fun, making the need to travel around during missions an absolute exercise in frustration and tedium. The way everyone will shoot you on sight no matter what gets really ridiculous eventually, since you don't even need to be aggressive towards someone randomly driving around in order for them to start relentlessly giving you chase as if their life depended on it.The way enemies respawn instantly after the area where you fought them is out of your line of sight (why not make them respawn until a full day has passed by?) practially makes clearing up the camps pointless. The few fast travel locations don't really help much in avoiding excessive driving around. Had there been more fast travel locations and the uber aggressive enemies were toned down a bit (or if they at least didn't respawn so quickly), I would've been more willing to put up with the repetitive missions, since repetitve as they were, they were still fun to play.I can't say much about the story itself since I didn't see it through to the end, but it was serviceable at best during my time playing. Not sure if it gets more interesting eventually, but if it does it sure takes a while to get going.Ultimately I decided to call it quits on the main story and side missions and decided to just muck around freely. It was a more liberating and fun experience, though the fun didn't last long since due to story reasons (the main character has malaria) you can't go around without checking your health periodically, which requires doing more repetitive missions and I couldn't be bothered with that anymore.Nevertheless, as I said at first, for the first 10 hours or so the game is awesome and I don't regret buying it. If you have more patience to deal with repetitive gameplay and can tolerate some of the more annoying design quriks, you'll certainly have fun with this game.			"

												Story? Nah. Beautiful graphics? Eh. Repetitive? Yeah.Awesome gameplay? Hard as nails difficulty? Yesss. This game is awesome fun. A little hard to get into, pretty slow to start, but once you gather a few upgrades, you're set. In Far Cry 2, you are not a badass murder machine who roams the lands with impunity. You are a malaria infected loner who prefers to wage gun battles with rusty pistols which explode on short notice while popping pills like candy when the fever strikes.If taken at face value, the game would be fairly boring. A large varied world with not a lot in it, lots of bad guys to shoot, a few collectibles. What it is, though, is an extremely immersive battle simulator. The AI is great, the gunplay is quite fun, the weapon jams add depth and unpredictability, and the amount of ways you can enter an encampment and ruin the mercenaries' day are many.When someone watched over my shoulder as I played, he said it was like watching an action movie. It's like that. It's tense, precise, and satisfying, and at higher difficulties, brutally decisive. You won't play it for the story. The characters are two-dimensional, all of them inhabit little huts where they spout exposition and then send you on another kill all the peoples mission. You almost make your own story in the playing of this game. With no HUD and a sprawling savannah, Far Cry 2 will suck you in if you let it.It's a dangerous world. Bring your machete.			"

It looks better than that cartoony ♥♥♥♥ that FarCry 3 and 4 have. Now FC3 and FC4 have good graphics but I feel as if im actually in this world unlike 3 and 4. This game has a tremendous storyline. The storyline contains so much backstabbing for yourself to do and when SPOILERS your companions backstab you. You know how Modern WarFare 2 made COD? Well this made FarCry. I really dont know why the metric score is lower than FC3. Anyways this game is a solid 9.9/10. Why 9.9? SPOILERS because after completing the game you can not go back and free roam. But the Story makes up a Solid Reason why this happens.			"

It has an open world, multiple places to get ""missions"" instead of just one guy telling you where to go.Most of the issues I had with Far Cry I where gone, and the vehicles were finally conotrolable, the guns worked fine, as long as they didn't explode in my hand... and the graphics go along without any glitches or strange behavior.The downside is the most repetitive story, which includes a lot of simple ""drive there and kill everybody"" stuff. The story is pretty boring in that case. Bute every 6 hours playtime you get a very interesting one.Great game if you want a simple open world place without anything fancy, but straight forward missions.

												Far Cry 2 is set in a large, beautifully crafted rendition of the African wilderness.  It includes very satisfying gunplay and it allows the tactical use of fire in skirmishes - set the savannah ablaze or lob a molotov cocktail to flush your enemy out of cover with realistically modelled fire propagation!  The fire and explosion mechanics are great and the weapons have a good feel to them.  Enemy AI is generally pretty good - they will search for you and respond to stimuli in a realistic manner.  Annoyingly (because it is so obviously incongruous that it breaks immersion), the distinctive black and white character voices often seem to be assigned to minor NPCs of the opposite race.  The wheeled vehicles don't handle anywhere nearly as well as the weapons, but thanks to the beautiful world design, exploring the wilds by track or river is still enjoyable, at least at first.  As the game goes on, the driving becomes a bit of a chore (realism sucks sometimes).  I found travelling by boat to be more immersive and enjoyable - they certainly seemed to handle more realistically than the wheeled vehicles.You play as a mercenary tasked with killing an unscrupulous arms dealer that is supplying both sides of a civil conflict with cheap weapons.  Given your role and mission, you take a fairly detached approach to the civil conflict.  For most of the game, the story was of some interest, but I did not find it particularly gripping.  At times, it felt like little more than an excuse for various assassination and destruction missions, although they were thrilling enough to keep me motivated to do all the requisite driving.  Approaching the end of the game, however, the story became substantially more interesting to me, as a new perspective on the conflict was revealed.There is quite a wide variety of weapons available, although I found myself using only a couple of favourites most of the time.  The world is massive and lovingly detailed.  With multiple African biomes, dynamic weather and wind that affects both vegetation and fire behaviour, it really is a wonderful place to explore.  The excellent gunplay is icing on the cake.By far the most realistic of the Far Cry series, with destructible environment and weapon degradation (including jamming), I found Far Cry 2 to be a challenging and enjoyable game.  The spawning of enemies at checkpoints was annoying at times and I would have liked an option for even more realistic damage levels (people don't often patch themselves up and fight on after being shot with an AK-47).  Although playing this way would have been a very difficult proposition, I think that it would have driven the use of different, more realistic tactics.  With such solid fundamentals, Far Cry 2 had potential to eclipse S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Shadow of Chernobyl as my favourite First-Person Shooter game ever made, had it been more mod-friendly.  Sadly, Ubisoft had other ideas.  Nevertheless, even as it approaches a decade after release, Far Cry 2 remains a great open world FPS.  I strongly recommend trying it f you like open world games and planning your gunplay engagements from stealth.  The world is gorgeous, the gunplay satisfying, and I think it's worth playing just for the realistic fire and destruction effects.			"

												A great looking game with plenty of depth and a two moderately-sized maps to explore. While a couple of systems feel a bit oppressive, which can be a turn-off for some, they also provide a good amount of thematic depth and challenge. Respawn times are a little too fast as well; you can have enemies chasing after you from an outpost you just cleared. All the challenges and difficulties with the game are significantly less than the overall fun and feel of speeding across the African landscape.			"

												$3.39 is a steal! Buy it now...or read my short review and then buy it.Note: My experience was altered using the Far Cry GES(Graphical Enhancement Suite) and Dylan's Realism Mod, I INSIST that you download these as they turn the game into what it was meant to be. If you decide to play with the Dylan's mod, play on Infamous diffuculty...trust me.Graphics:Stunning when using the GES, as it allows you to alter the saturation, contrast, and brightness (the game can be quite dark in the jungle). The jungles are vibrant, the deserts are scathing, and my goodness are the sunsets gorgeous. The weapon models are fantastic and the animations that go with them are even better, particularly the jamming ones. My only problem would be the environmental textures aren't great. Gameplay:This is a hardcore mercenary sim, whether it's CQC with shotguns and assault rifles,  wiping out a base from a safe distance with a sniper, or torching the whole base with a flame thrower, the heat of battle is intense and visceral. The guns handle great and the recoil is really nice, especially on the silenced makarov. Another great system is how fire works, when it's windy you could chuck a single molotov and the fire would spread to engulf the base in flame. One mixed bag in the game is stealth. Sometimes it works amazingly, other times not so much. For example: on a mission where I had to sneak into an old greenhouse and destroy an old pump, I took out a sniper on the outskirts of the base and then proceeded without taking any other enemies out. I snuck in and placed an IED on the pump and snuck out. It was glorious. On the other hand there are times where you are sneaking up and a sniper who is not even looking at you will all the sudden turn around, tell the other enemies where you are, and open fire. So stealth is definitely hit or miss. The AI can be weird at times too. Another system that is FANTASTIC is the buddy system, Quaribani, you will always be remembered as my first buddy. You really build a reputation with theses guys, and then all the sudden they can ripped away from you, you try desperately to save them as they are wounded, but you know it won't work and you have to do it, pull the trigger. You have various types of missions to choose from, the main story ones, buddy missions (different from the buddy objective in the main missions), assassination missions, and weapons dealer missions which unlock new guns.The main missions and the buddy missions take a little while, while the other two tend to be quicker. So overall the gameplay is really good, some of my favorite FPS gameplay for sure.Story:The story sets up like this: You're a mercenary who is hired to take out an arms dealer named the Jackal. He has supplied arms to two different factions in a civil war. You do work for these factions and in turn they give you information on the Jackal. The games faction missions can be very interesting if you do some of the Buddy objectives which make the missions longer, but they can also be VERY repetitive. If you're used to open world games this won't be a problem. Besides that problem, when the story picks up, it REALLY picks up. And depending on which ending you choose (yes, this is one of those games) it has a great ending(one word: briefcase).Sound:In short: weapons and sound good, voice acting is on fast forward, and everything else is hit or miss.Replayability:This is my one major problem in the game. There is no post story mode playability, you could load up an old save but I have so many it takes awhile to load. Your only other option is to start a new game. I don't understand why there isn't a feature like in the new Tomb Raider where at the end it tells you are now free to explore the island and do side objectives.Final Score:8.5/10. Buy it when it's on sale if you're unsure, but if it sounds like your type of game, go for it regardless of price. "

												This is my most favourite game so far. Recommended ( but keep reading befor making decision ) if you love open world stealth, good challenge, first person shooting and do not mind backtracking through hostiles and breathtaking vistas.The game has shortcomings. It must be played in a specific way to be enjoyable (which is true for most games anyway). I usually do not like limitations in gameplay that force you to play in some specific style, but in this case the style was exactly my style, so the shortcomings worked for me.The gameplay is....different. If that is not your thing, you will hate the game. Lets see. Enemies in the world are bullet sponges and respawn as soon as the area is reloaded in RAM. So there is no value in engaging them before you reach objective. Hardest difficulty will force you to find alternate routes and practice stealth movement and long range combat to thin out enemies around the objective. CQB stealth is broken but shooting is not. You can definitely run and gun if you have godly reflex and aim.Yes, guns are worth discussing. The loadout is too complex in this game. Ammo is not abundant. There is no good medium range gun (something that was fixed in FC3). I used to switch between Dragunov and MAC 10 for everything. The condition of silenced guns is even worse. The dart gun has very limited ammo and it is long range. The DLC silenced shotgun is very short range and will leave you vulnerable in open fields. The silenced MP5 is trash. The weapon slots are restricted, so you cannot carry the shotgun alongside a medium range weapon. You can carry the dart gun alongside a real sniper gun though, but that will disallow you from carrying rocket laucher or IED. That is no big loss outside specific missions, becaus there is no good rocket launcher. RPG is too inaccurate, but still better than others, the GL and MGL take slots of secondary and primary, so not worth carrying outside certain missions, the Carl G puts your ♥♥♥ on fire, and the viewfinder of the explosive bolts reflects sunlight so you must find proper angle which is not always possible.That leaves you very vulnerable in case your stealth fails and a vehicle with mounted guns attacks you. MAC 10 helps, but not against GMG mounted vehicles. I enjoyed the suspense, you might not. I spent more time staring at the map (I got a PDF from web and printed it) and in stealth travel than running and gunning.Has high replay value. I was not a completionist, so did not go collectible hunting, amd more than 40% of the areas were new to me during second play where I found new ways to approach missions.In my opinion Africa is the most beautiful location in the World, yet it is never explored in videogames. This game might have outdated graphics, but the quality of ambiance can only be compared to legends like HL, Morrowind, Minecraft etc. There is one fault in graphics though, it is graphically too demanding compared to its graphics quality. It does not run smoothly even in rigs that are just enough to handle Crisis unmodded.			"

												I honestly consider this game to be the following:One of Ubisoft's crowning titles before they went sour.One of the greatest games (I have ever played) of all time.Why? This game doesn't hold your hand, it's naturally difficult and spits in your face. You have to treat your Malaria, you have to make sure your guns don't blow up in your arms and make sure you treat your wounds before you have to pull shrapnel out of your arm, shove tweezers in your leg to pull a bullet out, or snap your limbs back into place.The visuals, even for an 8yr old game are still breathtaking. The gunplay is fantastic, the enemy AI is unscripted and plans against you according to the situation. Your no one special, your another run of the mill mercenary looking for work, you have no powers or magic, you have your guns, and your own will to survive.Now granted, the game can get boring for alot of people, this is still one of the greatest games I've ever played.Get this on sale and immerse yourself in War torn Africa, where everything and everyone is out to kill you.Easily a solid 9/10 for me, and defintely Ubisoft's last masterpiece.

												Far Cry 2It's probably the last to come to mind when i think of the Far Cry series, but it's actually not that bad.However, it can be pretty boring when driving on the savannah, and walking in general, i think it's because there isn't that much going on like in Far Cry 3 or 4, however the graphics are really good for a 8 year old game.One thing thats allways cool i the Far Cry franchise is taking over bases and going sneaky and being stelth, i think that Far Cry 2 may not be as good as Far Cry 4 in this part but it's still pretty good.One thing thats realy annoying is the fact that there is no minimap, but instead there is a map thats in the hot bar or inventory, so if i want to like check the map where i am going i have to switch from my gun to the map. There is not that much more to say about the game, i recomend it if you haven't played any of the sequels.			"

												I honestly consider this game to be the following:One of Ubisoft's crowning titles before they went sour.One of the greatest games (I have ever played) of all time.Why? This game doesn't hold your hand, it's naturally difficult and spits in your face. You have to treat your Malaria, you have to make sure your guns don't blow up in your arms and make sure you treat your wounds before you have to pull shrapnel out of your arm, shove tweezers in your leg to pull a bullet out, or snap your limbs back into place.The visuals, even for an 8yr old game are still breathtaking. The gunplay is fantastic, the enemy AI is unscripted and plans against you according to the situation. Your no one special, your another run of the mill mercenary looking for work, you have no powers or magic, you have your guns, and your own will to survive.Now granted, the game can get boring for alot of people, this is still one of the greatest games I've ever played.Get this on sale and immerse yourself in War torn Africa, where everything and everyone is out to kill you.Easily a solid 9/10 for me, and defintely Ubisoft's last masterpiece.

No ""Kiddo-Saves-The-(Beach)Day"" or ""Mutant-Lizard-Nazi-Creatures"" or ""TibetFreedomSimulator"", just a cold and merciless mercenary (with malaria, for some reason) hunting a merciless and cold arms dealer in a godforsaken, war-torn, third-world westafrican country.

												The game is so dam long! Have not finished it yet!EDIT: I still haven't finished it yet; however, this game is one of the most memorable FPS games I've owned in years. One of the first FPS games to introduced an in-game non-immersion breaking UI in which keeping count of ammunition, health conditions, GPS location, and danger was completely in the hands of the player's avatar. The storyline is superb, capturing the tension of a nation torn by Civil War and ruled by ruthless warlords, and yet still managing to thrust you into a position in which ambivalence is impossible. Only downside to this game is the enormity of it all, the game was honestly too big for comfort considering it was single-player and at the time, AI mechanics where still lacking in many respects when compared to today's games. Great game still, probably best appreciated by fans/students of the industry.			"

												You can hate this game as much as you like. It isn't the best game ever made, it wasn't better than all the other games released in 2008, and it has more glitches and problems than one would care for. There are 100 idiosyncracies left out of this game that would have made so much better as a video game, and still not look that much different, but . . . this game is meant to be any of those things. It is meant to be a story, a captivating story where you think you are hunting evil and you think you are helping out, but all the while showing you that no matter what you do, you're still just as destructive and dangerous as the evil that surrounds you. This is one of my favorite games even to today. Play it, it will keep you engaged.			"

												Have you ever thought about what canada would be like without gun control? Now you don't have to! Far cry 2 is the worlds most realistic post Stephan Harper administration simulator, featureing black people and sand. Lots and lots of sand. Sand. MMMmmmm delicious saaaand. There are black people. They seem to beleve you are the member of the kkk and therefore shoot on sight and attempt to run you over with dune buggies. They are also made of kevlar and tote guns that are held togeather with chewing gum and paper clips. Luckily for you your kkk connections allow you to obtain infinite amounts of firearms in perfect condition from a friendly black guy in a gas station. Im not sure why the other black guys just dont buy from him. Maybe its because he is selling to the kkk. I digress, another RESOLUTIONARY feature of this game is fire. Yeop thats right! FIRE. Never before in a game have we seen fire before. 3/10 Would bang with caution.			"

												It is hard to recommend this game because of how much of a pain it is, but it is also hard not to because of how fun it is.Malaria aspect is interesting, along with the guns jamming here and there. The game is quite empty, you have to drive for quite a while to get somewhere, and if you die, start all the way back. You have to save often in this game if you want to get anywhere. Respawning enemies can be frustrating, but its not too bad. Overall, I think that this is a great, unpolished game.Also, one of my Top 10 games of all time.Another side note, I got this game from selling steam trading cards during a summer sale.

												The criticisms behind Far Cry 2 are that it's repetitive and there isn't much context in it. The story may not make you want to stand up and shout at its excellence but the part of the game that absolutely sold it to me was the sandbox nature of it all. Any mission or job can be tackled in a myriad of different ways depending on how you want to do it. The gameplay is a lot more organic and freeform than something like Call of Duty where you're being led by the nose from objective to objective.			"

												Fun but flawed best explains this one.For the fun:• Gunplay is very fun and satisfying. Plenty of variety in weapons.• One of the most immersive (hate that word) games I have ever played. • A big beautiful maps.• Good voice acting and dialog. Doesn't come off as stilted or awkward.• Fire spreading mechanics were fun to play with.• Runs great. I had it completely maxxed out on my computer which is getting on in age.For the flaws:• Some not well thought out game mechanics, namely malaria and checkpoints.• Severely lacking a fast travel system. In my 33 hours of playing the majority of it was from driving place to place. (At least it was immersive..)• Missions could of done with some better varying.• Some weapons were not balanced well. (Was fixable with mods.)• Animals are completely pointless. Come on, when I think Africa, I think death by animals.• Checkpoints with quickly respawning enemies.Some really hate the malaria mechanic, which while annoying, was never game breaking or frequent enough to annoy me. (Also can be delayed with mods) All you have to do is a very quick delivery side mission for more pills. Saddly it never gets cured durng the game. Some also seem to really REALLY hate weapons degrading and jamming. I was never bothered by it and helped create some tense moments. I was frequently swaping my weapons with my bought ones since they last longer. I ended up barely dealing with jamming as a whole. (This also can be tweaked with mods.) The last big flaw to most and one that bugged me was the road checkpoints. Basically a small camp of enemies, usually at intersections. Since you have to drive everywhere and the checkpoints respawn basically after you leave, you end up being shot at a little to often. Plus they will follow you in jeeps with mounted guns, or worse, mounted grenade launchers.Saddly the animals could not be tweaked with mods.. they serve no purpose other than run around... and do nothing. They die to 1 hit by everything. A gazelle/impala thing WALKED into my PARKED ATV and just fell over dead. So at least they were amusingly pointless.The graphics were very nice, even though they were VERY brown. It fit with the game, but I still wish I was able to adjust the saturation to my own liking. The game also never breaks the First Person view ever, which was nice. Even using your map doesn't break you out of the game. Helped keep up the .. *sighs*.. immersion.All of these issues seem to have been fixed in Far Cry 3, from what I can tell from videos. I look forward to getting Far Cry 3 once it has it ""Game of The Year"" or ""Complete"" version out with all its DLC. If you want a fun but flawed game, you could do worse than Far Cry 2. I only paid $2.50 and feel it was well worth it. But if you want a less flawed game, go with Far Cry 3.			"

												Of all the Far Cry games THIS ONE is my favourite.Many people despise this game - truly a ""love it or loath it"".Your poorly maintained weapon will jam, missfire and break. Mercs will block your path at checkpoints and ruthlessly hunt you when you try to get away. Bush fires will turn on you and have you trying jumping in rivers. You will be overcome by MALARIA when you run out of medication. And those are the positives.Pretty average AI, ememies are bullet sponges, some washed out colours/textures, lack of predatory animals. + originally there were a couple of ""point of no return"" situations that meant you would miss out if you hadn't already played through the game and knew what to do before a certain time.Have played through it a few times on console (hundreds of hours), now going to try new content and modding to see how the game can be improved on.Africandave simulator 2008			"

												A truly great ""open world shooter"" with one MAJOR flaw.The AI are too good.It seems they can see through jungle, respawn minutes after killing you, and are constantly harassing you with drive-by attacks and respawning guard posts.This wouldn't be a problem expect the game's missions forces you to go through many guard checkpoints, and the roads are constantly monitored.And ""walking through the jungle"" around the guard posts is not an option as many boulders and cliffs force you back toward the roads.Everyone seems to just fire as soon as your spotted, regardless of what vehicle your in.They dont check to see who you are, the just open fire on you.If the AI were fixed in the game and the auto-respawning of guard posts were tamed down, this game could be a really good open world shooter.Sadly, however this main flaw keeps me from enjoying the game, and just kills whatever WOW factor the other qualities the game may offer.(Review original date: May 2011)Product paid for by reviewer			"

												Why I personally feel Far Cry 2 is still the best in the series:1st reason: No Facetious Antagonist. What I mean is there is no over-the-top drama queen playing puppet master over an already lucid reality. (Really, the psycho-male antagonist is getting old)2nd reason: Its Not Afflicted By Action Movie Animal Predators!Basically, youll notice in fc3 and fc4 (the same game just reskinned) that the friendly npc's and otherwise are completely negated by poorly scripted animal interactions. A badger has the same effect on the environment as a mountain lion. Its silly, it feels lazy, and it doesnt instill any confidence in the civilian/paramilitary AI.3rd reason: ITS NOT JUNGLE4th reason: The poorly received weapon damage system. Im sorry but if youve asked for an open world first person shooter to provide you with a proper sense of realism you will invariably have weapon decay. (Thats a given) It also adds a very interesting dynamic to the world; you are always conscientious to your gear and effectiveness.5th reason: Malaria; I know, its one of the most hated aspects of the game mechanic. It also makes the game more interesting because you really do reach a state of panic at times looking for your medication. You really do feel more a part of the world because you are consistently affected by it and in a way that you cant always control (just the same in reality.)6th reason: Its not copy and paste like the latter titles. Its doesnt force you to unlock the map in the generic ubisoft way (Assassin's Creed) and finally........ NO UPLAY!!!!  OMG NO UPLAY!!!!!So there ya go, if you can get over the ai (or man up and mod the ai a bit with the realism mod) and if you can look past the more repetitive missions (your an idiot if you think the other titles arent repetitive) then youve got an underrated gem on your hands.Thanks for reading!NO UPLAY WOOOOOOOOOOO!Puma~			"

												One of my favourte games of all time, everytime I stop playing its lure draws me back into it, a fantastic world while not adding to the gameplay with random events, immerserses the player in a war torn Africa. Gueardpost litter the road which creates an uneasy feeling of isolation as you, a lone mercenary must choose to sneak past or run in guns blazing. Having started a new playthrogh on the Infamous diffiuculy (Dylan's Realism Mod) I must say that the tension is a firefight keeps me engaed for hours, stalking an enemy outpost as you silently kill the snipers is a as satifying as the moment you clear out the gurardpost and not a single shot is fired by the enenmy. However the game does have its nagetives, the respawning outposts may make you angry, I do appreciate the added challenge having to tackle it agiain, maybe this time I attack from a diffrent angle or try a diffrent weapon. Keeps the game feeling fresh, the only time this really beacame an issue is there a outlost near the fort where you must give the Prince his Father's ring, the outpost tends to respawn too quickly and because of the dense foilage, its very hard to engage in combat. The stealth mechanics aswell appear to be very strange, ranging from ""Wow how did he not hear that',""I'm so clsoe to him how does he ot see me"" to ""How the heck did he know where I was"". The enemy AI reacts strangly to stealth as they could be as oblivius as a rock or as aleart as an eagle with x-ray goggles .  Other than a few dumb moments the AI is this games is fantastic! If you fire apon them with a sniper rifle they will run into cover and hide, while other gurads will flank your location. They communicate in comabat and dicuss and carry out tactics in real time. If they lose sight of you they begin searching the immidiate area, confidently shelling put insults, while if you slay too many of his buddies, they begin to get scared. If you wound a soldier, his friend will carry him to safety. One point that really set this as one of my favourate video games is the games interaction with fire, one small ember can set a whole guard post on fire and these interations with the environment that truely creates an authentic game world, where the AI reacts postivly or naegtivly to the spreading wildfire. You start one simply by shooting a oil lamp with the dart rifle creating a distraction as you move in. While fire does carry over into Far Cry 3, its lush tropical forests does not really empashise the deadly viral spreading of a wildfire like Far Cry 2 can. If you always thought about playing this game, get it on a sale and the Dylan's Realism Mod, it truly pushes the game into another level as you are as fragile as your enimies. If enjoy a game where you like choosing to fight or stay stealthy, this game for you. At 4K on the GTX 1080, this game looks stunning and runs like butter smooth!!			"

												Let me start off this review by stating that the only other far cry game I have played, is Far Cry 3. Which is one I have obtained and played for the first time recently along with this installment in the Far Cry series. Now onto the review.   Far Cry 2 is a open world FPS set in an undisclosed country in Africa in between two factions vying for power after the government has collapsed. You choose from a selection of characters in the start menu when starting a new game and then dive into the world of Far Cry 2.   You may see other reviews giving this game a not recommended for having buggy AI, or annoying grievances such as respawn times for guard outposts. But I can assure you that if you look past those, and actually prefer a game be too hard than too easy, then you will more than likely enjoy this game. Many people also claim that the functions of having malaria strikes, (your vision basically turning green and a ringing in your ears as you desperatly mash the heal button hoping you have a medicine left.) difficult tough to kill enemies, and weapon degradation are what brings this game down. But to that, I can say that if you like a game that doesn't hold your hand and makes you think on your feet while not being ridiculous in its punishments, then you will probably enjoy those elements. More than once I found myself panicking and running for any piece of cover you can while enemies take pot shots at you from a meter or more away. Enemies do not take it easy on you. Unlike Far Cry 3, where enemies can lose sight of you and give up relatively quickly, in this game, the enemies will pursue with an intent to hang you above their fireplace. They are brutal, and don't take very long to notice you.   There are reviews I have seen where people say the stealth is non existant, and the enemies sight distance is ""unrealistic"" but I say that they are wrong, and have simply not managed to find the right way to stealth in this game. The enemies and stealth system work on a sort of ""If I can't see them, they can't see me."" Meaning that if your definition of stealth is hiding in a single bush and peeking halfway out behind cover, aiming your gun right at the guy, then yes, the stealth is non existant. Same goes for sound. If an enemy is down the road, and you open fire with a .50 Cal mounted machine gun, they WILL come for you.  This game is also very immersive. Turn off the crosshair, and you are left with an FPS experience like no other. There is no mini map like in the other Far Cry's save for the first. You have your own map that you have to physically pull out to see where your objective is. And no, it doesn't half ♥♥♥ it and show a big red dot in game when you get ""close"" to the objective. You have to use all of your senses to navigate, and you will die. A lot. This game also does not have the same sort of regenerative health that Far cry 3 has. And doesn't have the same healing system either. I found in Far Cry 3 that the syringes were useless halfway through the game because the animations for healing were enough to bring me back to full health. In this game, you HAVE to find medkits. You only stabilize your health when you are at one bar of health. And it can either be, (depending on the injury), a  lenghty, cringe inducing animation as you finger your bullet hole, or a quick one, where you rip out a glass shard from your hand. And depending on who you are, you may find this absolutely ridiculous and infuriating, or immersive, and an amazing addition to a game that already challenges you to your limits in terms of FPS.  All in all, I believe that Far Cry 2 is a great game for people wanting an extreme challenge when it comes to FPS games. And tired of feeling like a super hardcore robot killing machine that people fear. Because in this game, you feel outmanned, outgunned, and outlived many times.  So with all that said, Far Cry 2 gets the Blue Thumb of Approval. Highly, highly recommend if you can forget everything you know about other Far Crys', and look past some occasional bugs. "

												Fairly good game, but IMO it is a bit over rated at least as a one player game.  The game got a bit monotonous driving and running to different spots far away on the map but there is fast travel and once you learn your way around it gets less burdonsome. The graphics and sound are very good considering when the game came out. The voice acting is rather poor, but if you dont care much for the 1 player then that doesnt matter. The AI in the game is really good and the enemies are quite smart for the most part. The AI is much better than a lot of games I have played even newer games. The story behind the game is just ok and the ending is pretty good and a surprise happens. I would give the game a 7/10.			"

												This rivals STALKER as my favorite game of all time. As far as immersion goes, FC2 is unsurpassed. The game feels exactly like my real life experience in overthrowing an unstable African nation. It's hard, especially on the higher difficulty levels. YOu have to think about how to approach each mission, which works well because you have a variety of options. While most of the missions can feel repetitive after a while, it's fine because the actual combat is intense. You can never let yourself be distracted or opting for the mindless approach, as each (infuriatingly respawning) checkpoint can kill you, no matter how many similar checkpoints you've cleared. Even the respawning checkpoints work out to a greater point, nothing you do is improving the country, no matter how many nameless enemies you kill. It's not perfect, as I mentioned many of the missions are repetitive, but the gameplay feels as intense and dark as the narrative, and every aspect of the game seems to blend together into a cohesive whole. Gunplay is absolutely amazing, with each shot deadly for both you and the enemy. Flare guns in particular deserve a special mention, as the fire physics are devastating in this game. Apparently during early stages of testing, the fires would rage out of control, spreading across the entire map and killing every single character. The developers restricted fire to spread to a perfect circle, but to be completely honest I never noticed that as I usually used fire as a temporary distraction to flush enemies out of cover or to cover my escape. It can be frustrating to escape enemies in vehicles, as they'll chase you to hell and beyond, but now I'm just nitpicking. Nothing in the game breaks the immersion or flow, the map is an item you can pull out and look at while driving, and the entirety of the game reinforces the brutality of the setting and the fact that you're not a golden hero, magically fixing everything for the natives. Even the ending goes for the same, I won't spoil it but suffice to say, The Jackal (FC2's antagonist) is probably my favorite character in video game history.			"

												In response to the success of far cry 3, I feel it's time I look back and take a more in-depth review of far cry 2. Upon first look, it's a game with a terrible story and many infuriating game mechanics. More specifically, players hate the permanent dependance on malaria medication, the accelerated weapon degradation, the re-populating enemy strongholds and checkpoints, and the unusual fast-travel system. If you find yourself miserable due to all these problems, I understand if you want to un-install. However...I find a dusty, bloody, and primal charm from the whole game experience. Every issue I listed above is actually a reason as to why I love this game! And for me, it all comes down to immersion in the game's world. For example, the story doesn't grab you like it does in so many GOTYs. Instead of creating some elaborate story for the player to get distracted by, players are sent on small missions that allow them to play the game their own way. Weapon degradation forces you to use foresight and planning to ensure you are at your prime. Malaria also keeps you focused on living day-to-day, and prevents you from being the uber-warrior that so many games make you into. Never-ending enemy spawning keeps you on your toes. The fast-travel-by-bus system allows you to make short leaps around the map, but only in certain areas, forcing you to plan your routes effectively.Overall, far cry 2 is unapologetically rough. Underneath the seemingly frustrating game features lies highly immersive gameplay. The beautiful and lifelike ambient sounds and stunning visuals are just icing on the bloody, bloody cake.P.S.: I originally wanted to call FC2 realistic, but I now see it as engrossing, which is much more fun. If you can buy this game at $2.50 on a sale, please give this game a try.			"

Sometimes it can feel clunky and empty of the fancy gadgets of its sequels, sometimes it's absurdly frustrating, but this offers a very unique experience and story. Are there flaws, yes, but you get thrown into the wilds of Africa and what you choose to do and how you do it is up to you, unlike Ajay from 4 or Californian Kid #5 from 3. It's you that's there, and it's you doing the things as you choose to do them, not you as Ajay or as Jason would.Far Cry 2 offers a different philosophical experience than the tight stories and wacky characters of her sequels, here you get to journey into the Heart of Darkness/Apocalypse Now nihlistic hell, and in my opinion Toto's Africa rings true.

												Far Cry 2’s story isn’t great. you are sent into an African country in order to assassinate an arms dealer who is supplying both sides of a civil war. Over the course of the game you work for each side trying to get ever closer to your target blah blah blah basic stuff.If it sounds like I’m irritated, that’s because I am. This is due to Far Cry 2 having the gaming equivalent of the Plagues of Egypt. Respawning guard checkpoints, guns with no durability, constantly being followed around by jeeps with gun turrets and an actual plague itself in the form of your character having malaria. Each of these require careful management to keep you on top. It’s frustrating, but damn is it good. If you can get the hang of keeping your guns in order, sneaking through guard checkpoints and topping yourself up on malaria pills then what remains is a great single player experience.			"

												Fun but flawed best explains this one.For the fun:• Gunplay is very fun and satisfying. Plenty of variety in weapons.• One of the most immersive (hate that word) games I have ever played. • A big beautiful maps.• Good voice acting and dialog. Doesn't come off as stilted or awkward.• Fire spreading mechanics were fun to play with.• Runs great. I had it completely maxxed out on my computer which is getting on in age.For the flaws:• Some not well thought out game mechanics, namely malaria and checkpoints.• Severely lacking a fast travel system. In my 33 hours of playing the majority of it was from driving place to place. (At least it was immersive..)• Missions could of done with some better varying.• Some weapons were not balanced well. (Was fixable with mods.)• Animals are completely pointless. Come on, when I think Africa, I think death by animals.• Checkpoints with quickly respawning enemies.Some really hate the malaria mechanic, which while annoying, was never game breaking or frequent enough to annoy me. (Also can be delayed with mods) All you have to do is a very quick delivery side mission for more pills. Saddly it never gets cured durng the game. Some also seem to really REALLY hate weapons degrading and jamming. I was never bothered by it and helped create some tense moments. I was frequently swaping my weapons with my bought ones since they last longer. I ended up barely dealing with jamming as a whole. (This also can be tweaked with mods.) The last big flaw to most and one that bugged me was the road checkpoints. Basically a small camp of enemies, usually at intersections. Since you have to drive everywhere and the checkpoints respawn basically after you leave, you end up being shot at a little to often. Plus they will follow you in jeeps with mounted guns, or worse, mounted grenade launchers.Saddly the animals could not be tweaked with mods.. they serve no purpose other than run around... and do nothing. They die to 1 hit by everything. A gazelle/impala thing WALKED into my PARKED ATV and just fell over dead. So at least they were amusingly pointless.The graphics were very nice, even though they were VERY brown. It fit with the game, but I still wish I was able to adjust the saturation to my own liking. The game also never breaks the First Person view ever, which was nice. Even using your map doesn't break you out of the game. Helped keep up the .. *sighs*.. immersion.All of these issues seem to have been fixed in Far Cry 3, from what I can tell from videos. I look forward to getting Far Cry 3 once it has it ""Game of The Year"" or ""Complete"" version out with all its DLC. If you want a fun but flawed game, you could do worse than Far Cry 2. I only paid $2.50 and feel it was well worth it. But if you want a less flawed game, go with Far Cry 3.			"

However, still very playable for an average gamer.Controls - 4/5 Very General, there's nothing hard with the controls but nothing new really, your average shooter/rpg controls.Storyline - 2/5 I hated it. I think they did an original storyline, decided that a game this size needed a longer storyline and so did a lot of copy and pasting.AI - 2/5 Poor. Once you wipe out a outpost/road checkpoint, apparently, all the guys twin brothers arrive 5 seconds later and have set up defensive positions. Fed up of having to deal with 20 guys every 100m down a road.Good Point - If you're looking for a game which is easy to get into, plenty of fun weapons where you can burn and shoot some general guys, then you're looking at the right game.Bad Point - If you're looking for something where you call fall in love with the characters and the gameplay.

Despite it being very frustrating to have happen to you in the middle of a firefight, it's nice, unique, and I love it. I haven't yet finished the game, but I plan on it soon.

The controls and graphics are great, my qualm is with the super-accurate and repetitive AI, but the locations and missions are varied enough to hold your interest til the end at least. No civilians and flat characters make the story pointless. A good shooter though. 7/10			"

												At first when I purchased this game, I disliked it due to it being very gritty and different compared to the other Far Cry games. I came back to this game recently and man I love it. The buddy system is great, and rusting/jamming weapons is not something you see a whole lot in video games at all. Despite it being very frustrating to have happen to you in the middle of a firefight, it's nice, unique, and I love it. I haven't yet finished the game, but I plan on it soon. I would definitely recommend this game if you would like to experience a realistic, gritty, and fun first person shooter experience that is unique to Far Cry 2.			"

												It is hard to recommend this game because of how much of a pain it is, but it is also hard not to because of how fun it is.Malaria aspect is interesting, along with the guns jamming here and there. The game is quite empty, you have to drive for quite a while to get somewhere, and if you die, start all the way back. You have to save often in this game if you want to get anywhere. Respawning enemies can be frustrating, but its not too bad. Overall, I think that this is a great, unpolished game.Also, one of my Top 10 games of all time.Another side note, I got this game from selling steam trading cards during a summer sale. Bought the game without any idea of what I was getting into.			"

												I have only had a few hours on this game so far, and it seems to be a decent game. The graphics are quite dated, and it will only run in DX9 mode, DX10 makes it crash randomly. I haven't gotten too far in the story yet but it isn't all that special so far. The game play is pretty fun, though. That is why I'd recommend this. It feels quite rough around the edges, but it is fun and these days it is very cheap! There were quite a few things that could have been done differently, such as utilizing the map for enemy positions and check points, and an autosave checkpoint in the missions would have been really, really nice.I likely won't finish this game at all, only bought it because it was deeply discounted and included in the franchise pack. It is fun enough to play every once in a while, but can get frusterating after long play sessions. 6/10 from me.			"

												A very beautiful and immense game, the physics are great(besides undestructible buildings), the world looks like its alive. It's a very good potrayal of Africa. Must people are offset from the game because of the ammount of driving, Really the driving isnt bad and anyone who thinks it is probably doesnt have a life because it only takes like 2 minutes to get somewhere if you're a good driver. I'm saying they dont have a life because they've obviously never driven anywhere before.10/10			"

												Of all the Far Cry games THIS ONE is my favourite.Many people despise this game - truly a ""love it or loath it"".Your poorly maintained weapon will jam, missfire and break. Mercs will block your path at checkpoints and ruthlessly hunt you when you try to get away. Bush fires will turn on you and have you trying jumping in rivers. You will be overcome by MALARIA when you run out of medication. And those are the positives.Pretty average AI, ememies are bullet sponges, some washed out colours/textures, lack of predatory animals. + originally there were a couple of ""point of no return"" situations that meant you would miss out if you hadn't already played through the game and knew what to do before a certain time.Have played through it a few times on console (hundreds of hours), now going to try new content and modding to see how the game can be improved on.Africandave simulator 2008			"

												I've played alot of FPS games over the years, but I've poured more hours into this one than any other.  Creating your own maps and sharing them is much better and easy to share than what Far Cry 3 offered.  The multiplayer in this game seems to be dead, which is a shame because although the single player mode has one of the best FPS campagins I ever played (beats FC3 again for me), it's greatest feature was sharing and playing player made maps.  Played for years on the PS3 and only just bought it again on Steam to try and complete the single player again but with better graphics on my new PC.  If anyone knows a way to get the full multiplayer feature back with popular private server, let me know, that would be awesome.			"

												It took me a little while to get into Far Cry 2, but that was more because I was busy with other games.  Once I took the time to actually start following the storyline, it kept me coming back for more.  Hours upon hours of play, and I'm still enjoying every minute of it.  I especially like the weapons in the game.  If you pick up a rusty pistol in the middle of a firefight, you'll end up jamming your weapon at some point, and you'll have to take a minute to fix it before you continue firing.  When your health starts to get low, you can take some cover, and pull the bullet out of your leg with a pair of plyers before you keep fighting.  It's a challenge, at times, but that's never a bad thing.  There's a huge variety of weapons from pistols, to rifles, snipers, and even explosive crossbows, and a huge map to explore and mercenaries trying to kill you at every turn.  Tons of fun, a good story, and a lot of merciless killing.  Just what you want in a first person shooter.			"

												Let me start off this review by stating that the only other far cry game I have played, is Far Cry 3. Which is one I have obtained and played for the first time recently along with this installment in the Far Cry series. Now onto the review.   Far Cry 2 is a open world FPS set in an undisclosed country in Africa in between two factions vying for power after the government has collapsed. You choose from a selection of characters in the start menu when starting a new game and then dive into the world of Far Cry 2.   You may see other reviews giving this game a not recommended for having buggy AI, or annoying grievances such as respawn times for guard outposts. But I can assure you that if you look past those, and actually prefer a game be too hard than too easy, then you will more than likely enjoy this game. Many people also claim that the functions of having malaria strikes, (your vision basically turning green and a ringing in your ears as you desperatly mash the heal button hoping you have a medicine left.) difficult tough to kill enemies, and weapon degradation are what brings this game down. But to that, I can say that if you like a game that doesn't hold your hand and makes you think on your feet while not being ridiculous in its punishments, then you will probably enjoy those elements. More than once I found myself panicking and running for any piece of cover you can while enemies take pot shots at you from a meter or more away. Enemies do not take it easy on you. Unlike Far Cry 3, where enemies can lose sight of you and give up relatively quickly, in this game, the enemies will pursue with an intent to hang you above their fireplace. They are brutal, and don't take very long to notice you.   There are reviews I have seen where people say the stealth is non existant, and the enemies sight distance is ""unrealistic"" but I say that they are wrong, and have simply not managed to find the right way to stealth in this game. The enemies and stealth system work on a sort of ""If I can't see them, they can't see me."" Meaning that if your definition of stealth is hiding in a single bush and peeking halfway out behind cover, aiming your gun right at the guy, then yes, the stealth is non existant. Same goes for sound. If an enemy is down the road, and you open fire with a .50 Cal mounted machine gun, they WILL come for you.  This game is also very immersive. Turn off the crosshair, and you are left with an FPS experience like no other. There is no mini map like in the other Far Cry's save for the first. You have your own map that you have to physically pull out to see where your objective is. And no, it doesn't half ♥♥♥ it and show a big red dot in game when you get ""close"" to the objective. You have to use all of your senses to navigate, and you will die. A lot. This game also does not have the same sort of regenerative health that Far cry 3 has. And doesn't have the same healing system either. I found in Far Cry 3 that the syringes were useless halfway through the game because the animations for healing were enough to bring me back to full health. In this game, you HAVE to find medkits. You only stabilize your health when you are at one bar of health. And it can either be, (depending on the injury), a  lenghty, cringe inducing animation as you finger your bullet hole, or a quick one, where you rip out a glass shard from your hand. And depending on who you are, you may find this absolutely ridiculous and infuriating, or immersive, and an amazing addition to a game that already challenges you to your limits in terms of FPS.  All in all, I believe that Far Cry 2 is a great game for people wanting an extreme challenge when it comes to FPS games. And tired of feeling like a super hardcore robot killing machine that people fear. Because in this game, you feel outmanned, outgunned, and outlived many times.  So with all that said, Far Cry 2 gets the Blue Thumb of Approval. Highly, highly recommend if you can forget everything you know about other Far Crys', and look past some occasional bugs. "

												Fairly good game, but IMO it is a bit over rated at least as a one player game.  The game got a bit monotonous driving and running to different spots far away on the map but there is fast travel and once you learn your way around it gets less burdonsome. The graphics and sound are very good considering when the game came out. The voice acting is rather poor, but if you dont care much for the 1 player then that doesnt matter. The AI in the game is really good and the enemies are quite smart for the most part. The AI is much better than a lot of games I have played even newer games. The story behind the game is just ok and the ending is pretty good and a surprise happens. I would give the game a 7/10.			"

												You can hate this game as much as you like. It isn't the best game ever made, it wasn't better than all the other games released in 2008, and it has more glitches and problems than one would care for. There are 100 idiosyncracies left out of this game that would have made so much better as a video game, and still not look that much different, but . . . this game is meant to be any of those things. It is meant to be a story, a captivating story where you think you are hunting evil and you think you are helping out, but all the while showing you that no matter what you do, you're still just as destructive and dangerous as the evil that surrounds you. This is one of my favorite games even to today. Play it, it will keep you engaged.			"

												Clint Hocking's a genius, but it certainly took me a few hours (across the span of about five years) before Far Cry 2 finally clicked.This game is outright unfair toward the player, but that's kind of the point. The openness of game and its encounter design remain unmatched in the realm of shooters. Far Cry 3 seemed to learn all the wrong lessons, and the Assassin's Creedification of the series only served to clutter the screen with way too much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Having your .50 cal sniper rifle fall to pieces in your hands, forcing you to pick up an unreliable AK from the body of one of the militiamen you've just dropped and wing the damned thing--it's just exhilerating.Great game. Better than what came before and certainly better than what's come since.			"

Far cry 2 is the worlds most realistic post Stephan Harper administration simulator, featureing black people and sand. Lots and lots of sand. Sand. MMMmmmm delicious saaaand. There are black people. They seem to beleve you are the member of the kkk and therefore shoot on sight and attempt to run you over with dune buggies. They are also made of kevlar and tote guns that are held togeather with chewing gum and paper clips. Luckily for you your kkk connections allow you to obtain infinite amounts of firearms in perfect condition from a friendly black guy in a gas station. Im not sure why the other black guys just dont buy from him. Maybe its because he is selling to the kkk. I digress, another RESOLUTIONARY feature of this game is fire. Yeop thats right! FIRE.

												This game was designed to be unforgiving and harsh, and that's just the way I like it. Malaria gives you a sense of mortality that a lot of games tend to shy away from, and weapon malfunction is a great way to force improvisation. Even the high rate of enemy respawn has appeal; it's taught me to plan every mission in advance, and enemies that keep coming are the only ones that force you to keep yourself on your toes at all times. The UFLL and APR can call in as many foreign mercenaries as they want to; I'll keep cutting them down.I honestly don't understand why some people complain about these things. Especially traveling.

												Why I personally feel Far Cry 2 is still the best in the series:1st reason: No Facetious Antagonist. What I mean is there is no over-the-top drama queen playing puppet master over an already lucid reality. (Really, the psycho-male antagonist is getting old)2nd reason: Its Not Afflicted By Action Movie Animal Predators!Basically, youll notice in fc3 and fc4 (the same game just reskinned) that the friendly npc's and otherwise are completely negated by poorly scripted animal interactions. A badger has the same effect on the environment as a mountain lion. Its silly, it feels lazy, and it doesnt instill any confidence in the civilian/paramilitary AI.3rd reason: ITS NOT JUNGLE4th reason: The poorly received weapon damage system. Im sorry but if youve asked for an open world first person shooter to provide you with a proper sense of realism you will invariably have weapon decay. (Thats a given) It also adds a very interesting dynamic to the world; you are always conscientious to your gear and effectiveness.5th reason: Malaria; I know, its one of the most hated aspects of the game mechanic. It also makes the game more interesting because you really do reach a state of panic at times looking for your medication. You really do feel more a part of the world because you are consistently affected by it and in a way that you cant always control (just the same in reality.)6th reason: Its not copy and paste like the latter titles. Its doesnt force you to unlock the map in the generic ubisoft way (Assassin's Creed) and finally........ NO UPLAY!!!!  OMG NO UPLAY!!!!!So there ya go, if you can get over the ai (or man up and mod the ai a bit with the realism mod) and if you can look past the more repetitive missions (your an idiot if you think the other titles arent repetitive) then youve got an underrated gem on your hands.Thanks for reading!NO UPLAY WOOOOOOOOOOO!Puma~			"

												One of my favourte games of all time, everytime I stop playing its lure draws me back into it, a fantastic world while not adding to the gameplay with random events, immerserses the player in a war torn Africa. Gueardpost litter the road which creates an uneasy feeling of isolation as you, a lone mercenary must choose to sneak past or run in guns blazing. Having started a new playthrogh on the Infamous diffiuculy (Dylan's Realism Mod) I must say that the tension is a firefight keeps me engaed for hours, stalking an enemy outpost as you silently kill the snipers is a as satifying as the moment you clear out the gurardpost and not a single shot is fired by the enenmy. However the game does have its nagetives, the respawning outposts may make you angry, I do appreciate the added challenge having to tackle it agiain, maybe this time I attack from a diffrent angle or try a diffrent weapon. Keeps the game feeling fresh, the only time this really beacame an issue is there a outlost near the fort where you must give the Prince his Father's ring, the outpost tends to respawn too quickly and because of the dense foilage, its very hard to engage in combat. The stealth mechanics aswell appear to be very strange, ranging from ""Wow how did he not hear that',""I'm so clsoe to him how does he ot see me"" to ""How the heck did he know where I was"". The enemy AI reacts strangly to stealth as they could be as oblivius as a rock or as aleart as an eagle with x-ray goggles .  Other than a few dumb moments the AI is this games is fantastic! If you fire apon them with a sniper rifle they will run into cover and hide, while other gurads will flank your location. They communicate in comabat and dicuss and carry out tactics in real time. If they lose sight of you they begin searching the immidiate area, confidently shelling put insults, while if you slay too many of his buddies, they begin to get scared. If you wound a soldier, his friend will carry him to safety. One point that really set this as one of my favourate video games is the games interaction with fire, one small ember can set a whole guard post on fire and these interations with the environment that truely creates an authentic game world, where the AI reacts postivly or naegtivly to the spreading wildfire. You start one simply by shooting a oil lamp with the dart rifle creating a distraction as you move in. While fire does carry over into Far Cry 3, its lush tropical forests does not really empashise the deadly viral spreading of a wildfire like Far Cry 2 can. If you always thought about playing this game, get it on a sale and the Dylan's Realism Mod, it truly pushes the game into another level as you are as fragile as your enimies. If enjoy a game where you like choosing to fight or stay stealthy, this game for you. At 4K on the GTX 1080, this game looks stunning and runs like butter smooth!!			"

												This game isn't for the faint of heart. It's a brutal slog through a nameless war-torn country in Africa where everything is against you. Both warring factions will attack you on sight, vehicles break down, and guns will degrade and jam on you when you need them the most.Whereas Far Cry 3 & 4 give the player a sense of empowerment over their surroundings, this game makes you feel oppressed by the terrible environment you're in.

Gun-play is top-notch and just what you'd expect from a Far Cry game. AI is hit and miss. Story didn't make much sense to me but doesn't really matter. The African environment can be monochromatic at times but overall looks good and even gives a surreal element to the game (where are all the citizens??).After playing FC3 & 4 it was nice coming back and playing through this game for the contrast.

You have to drive 5 minutes to mission just to kill 1 guy in 10 seconds and then drive back, 5 minutes again. Story could be interesting, but not in this way.

												It's good.  Looks and feels very smooth.  Story has some problems, but overall above average for an FPS.  An impressive step from Far Cry 1, which I thought was horrible.Three major problems:1.  Traveling between locations for missions gets very repetitive, fighting your way through the same guard stations over and over.  All the traveling about makes the game feel like it drags on unnecessarily.2.  There are a couple points where the game presents you with some choices that seem really major, but they're completely fake.  Nothing at all changes based on what you choose.3.  You're given a lot of freedom to approach combat however you want, but there's no reason to do anything but thin out the enemy with some sniping and then casually walk in and mop up with an LMG.  The game almost never forces you to be any more resourceful.I'd rate it 75/100			"

Upgrading your weapons and gear is somewhat useless anyway.The open world doesn't really invite to explore because a quest will sooner or later take you everywhere anyway.Too much time is spent driving around. The guard camps get constantly refilled which makes getting around even more tedious.Saving is only allowed at specific locations which is generally fine but if a quest is actually hard you often have to repeat a lot of boring stuff to get to the interesting stuff.

												Far Cry 2, although it's not even really a sequel to Far Cry, is an amazing game. Why did they call it Far Cry 2? I don't know. The only similarities between the two titles involve the driving mechanics and the shooting mechanics. Otherwise, they have nothing in common.However, in my opinion, Far Cry 2 is the better game. While Far Cry had a more involving story, Far Cry 2 had a more interesting setting. The open world, fictional, war torn, central African country that your mercenary character arrives in is immersive and glorious. From savanahs, to jungles, to deserts and sand dunes, to valleys, Ubisoft Montreal packed everything you might find in a central African country into this 16 square mile playground. The towns are small and sparse, but the wildlife you find in between will capture your bewilderment. This, simply put, is a fully realized environment. And it's absolutely stunning.On the story side of things, the only thing I have to say about it is that it could have been more inspired. Basically, you choose a mercenary at the beginning of the game, and you play as that mercenary. The rest of the mercs on this list end up being your ""buddies"". Anyway, the story of the game is that you, an assassin for hire, was sent to this fictional country to kill ""The Jackal"", an international arms dealer who is supplying both factions that are fighting for power. Well, as soon as you get to this country, your malaria kicks in and ""The Jackal"" ends up saving you. ""The Jackal"" is, hands down, the most interesting character in the game. His philosophy about the current state of the country and his knowledge of politics invoke that he has no personal interest in whoever wins, but he is moralistic in that he does care about the civilians. After he leaves you for dead with a gun and machete, you escape and are saved by one of the faction generals who will task you with saving your first buddy. This is where the game gets repetitive, at least it seems to.Eventually, you'll save every buddy traversing through each area, doing missions for both faction leaders, doing missions for gun runners, doing missions for a mysterious contracter (assassinations). And, without going into details, these missions aren't that interesting. The only interesting moments honestly involve the few cutscenes you have with ""The Jackal"". But that doesn't mean the story is bad. It's just fleshed out with mercenary work as you are, after all, an assassin for hire. Eventually, you'll travel south to another part of the country where the remainder of the game takes place and more of the same is done. You find more buddies, you do more missions for the APR and the UFLL, and the, endgame.In terms of gameplay, this game is amazing. The hyper realism (except for car repairs which are the opposite of realistic) is splendid. Your gun will wear down and jam, you have to perform quick self surgeries if near death, branches and shrubs sway out of the way, the HUD is completely off when driving or running around, you have to take malaria pills to fight the malaria. The other interesting aspect is the use of diamonds as a form of currency. This is certainly much in line with how some African countries are due to a lack of a formal government.To summarize, brilliant FPS despite the weak story. And it's not even a weak story, it's just that the story was so sparse. The Jackal is such a great character, though, that he ends up saving the story.9.3/10			"

Intro:Far Cry 2 was considered a good game at the time of release, but its gotten a lot of hate over the years.While it can definitely get repetitive, I still think its a pretty fun game and worth your time if you can get it for a couple dollars.Gameplay:The gameplay is pretty self-explanatory. Its a first person shooter. You kill some dudes, drive somewhere, talk to a guy, repeat.Don't take that as a means of negativity though, I actually enjoyed this game a good bit.The controls are very tight and responsive. The gunplay just feels good. When it comes to guns, there is a currency and ways to unlock new ones as you progress. I liked having things to work toward. After purchasing a gun it goes to a gun room where you can permanently access it. You are able to take weapons from enemies, but they'll be old and occasionally jam so saving up to buy your own is ideal.That's one thing I'll mention now - Older weapons do jam. You can tell when a weapon is old because it'll be dirty and rusted. This seems to be a very big complaint with the game, but I had no issues with it. Weapon deterioration is there to encourage you to swap your guns out. There's many safehouses around the map where you can retrieve stored weapons so its not a big deal and I almost never dealt with my guns jamming.When it comes to the missions, you'll be accepting specific objectives. There are a bunch of sidequests all over the place as well that are quite rewarding. Completely optional though; you can just carry on with the story missions if you prefer.While you will run into some more unique missions on occasion, you're usually going through a number of unique locations and taking out everyone. Sometimes you'll rescue someone or stop a delivery truck. Its pretty basic, but can be fun. One problem is this game lacks in stealth department, with the exception of a couple weapons such as the dart rifle. I found it pretty fun sniping people with it from far away, but its insanely easy to get spotted and have your cover blown if you're using anything else.The game can get repetitive and another common complaint is these camps set up around the map. Driving through them almost always gets a group of enemies chasing after you. This can slow gameplay down and become a bit of a pain. In most cases you can drive around the camps to avoid this, but you shouldn't have to do that in the first place.So the map itself? Its a pretty good size. You'll start out with only half the map though. As you progress through the story you'll eventually uncover the second half. When it comes to safehouses and some other locations, you'll have to discover them. If you like collecting in games then that's something that might keep you busy as well as finding hidden boxes that have your main currency in them. There's a couple towns, some bus stations for faster travel, and a ton of sidequests to run into.Another thing to mention is driving is your main transportation. You'll want to find vehicles. The driving mechanics are pretty good. There is fast travel, but it requires you go to a specific point before using it and it also advances the time which can be obnoxious. The day/ night cycle is fine and all, but some objectives are harder at night. You can always sleep in a safehouse to pass the time though.I do want to point out how immersive this game is to me. I really loved wandering around the world and taking on the missions. Sure, its simple but the atmosphere of the game really pulled me in. I also love how even the map is an item you pull out in front of you rather than a HUD icon. While this isn't a roleplaying game, there's definitely room to roleplay your own character - similar to games like Skyrim or Fallout. I found it pretty fun for that, but it requires you to be a huge nerd with some imagination!One final nitpick is there's something like 8 or 12 characters to pick from. All of them are males. The game was meant to have 4 female characters, but cut them out for absolutely no reason. I have no issues playing a dude, but does every game have to be such a sausage fest? Why completely cut out the female characters?Complaints aside, I really enjoyed the gameplay despite its simplicity.Story, Visuals, & Music:Far Cry's 2 story isn't too deep, but its enough to keep you going. I won't spoil anything but it ended up being somewhat satisfying and the way the storyline is setup worked pretty well.This game might be a bit old now, but it still looks great. The graphical quality is pretty nice with high textures and impressive lightning. The foilage could be better, but this was what.. 2008?For a game that's almost 10 years old, it looks amazing. The only problem is its incredibly dull and washed out. There's so much detail that is hardly noticeable with the washed out color scheme. Fortunately, this is an easy fix with ReShade or SweetFX. There's been a number of configs released for this game that really bring out its beauty and making your own isn't too difficult either.As for the audio, it definitely sets that Africa feel. The music may have not been memorable, but it really helped with the immersion aspect!PC Version:This port is a bit of a pain. Its nothing like Dark Souls or Saints Row 2, but its not perfect.Going into windowed mode and back to full screen always messed up my resolution. It would be stuck in 720p until I restarted. The game also has a horrible feeling stutter. I had to use the console to cap my FPS with a command. This was the only way I got rid of the stuttering. You might be able to make an autoexec to do it for you, but I'm not sure.There are some mods for this game. Nothing mindblowing, but some of the issues I mentioned like enemies at camps chasing you, weapons jamming, and stealth are vastly improved through mods out there. I've never tried them myself, but they're definitely worth looking into.I have no idea if the multiplayer servers are still up. I don't think they are, but this is one of those singleplayer games with the MP tacked on. You won't be missing much if you can't play it.Conclusion:Far Cry 2 may not be some amazing game nowadays and I imagine the sequels are superior, but it was pretty cool for its time. I think the game still holds up, especially for people who enjoy getting immersion.It may not be something worth a bunch of money, but if you can get it cheap then definitely try it out.I think its still a pretty good game, despite being a little repetitive and having some minor issues.

												Better than the next Far Cry game. Why? Because it's more realistic like when you're grabbing gun,your guns can be destroyed and sometimes it jammed. And you got malaria in this game.The game itself it set in Africa.The best thing for me in this game is when i throw/shoot something that explosive it'll burn the ground and spread out everywhere either in the ground,building,and tree.I rate 9.5/10 The thing that i don't like that car that we drive easily destroyed			"

												No game has ever ended for me quite the same way Far Cry 2 did. That is, I didn't see it through to the end at all, at least the indended end. What happened instead is that about halfway through, I accidentaly shot my sister-in-arms while she was bleeding into the dusty sub-Saharan soil, begging me for help. You see, when one of your ""buddies"" goes down in a firefight, a plume of blue smoke will direct you to their location. You then have the option to either heal them with a magic syrette, leave them to their fate or, it turns out, blow their brains out right there and then. That latter option is denoted with the prompt ""Press 2 for handgun"". Clear enough, you'd think. Except I had been under the impression that ""handgun"" in this context would mean hauling the buddy to their feet and dragging them to safety, while fending off remaining assailants with a sidearm in your free hand. Because that is precisely what the buddies themselves will do for you when you've eaten one too many helpings of cold lead. So when instead of lending a helping hand, I watched myself put a gun to my friend's head and pull the trigger, I was left agape. Literally agape. As in, my mouth was hanging open and I was staring at the screen, for a good minute or so. After that, I drove around aimlessly for an hour or so, picking random fights, absent-mindedly going through the motions to complete a side mission. After that, I hopped onto a boat, drove out to a rocky island in the middle of a lake, climbed to the highest point I could reach, dropped an IED at my own feet and blew myself to hell, And thus ended the short and miserable career of Andre the Haitian. Definitely recommended.			"

												Sent on a mission to find and kill a man, you play as a mercanary of your choice, who by chance just happens to get Malaria while arriving in Africa. After your target looks through your belongings and gives you a machete after some kinky time on the bed, he leaves and tells you to get a job. Since you're a loser that does what anyone tells you for raw diamonds, you  proceede to help two factions fighting eachother, and kill numerous African people made out of kevlar(pick a white character for extreme butthurt). You collect weapons at an alarming rate while commiting assassinations, and do not once question if you have a problem. Every know and then you look for a ""trusty doctor"" who you save in trade for a unlabled bottle of ""malaria medication(maybe this is all a big drug trip). Also people leave diamonds with trackers all over Africa(who knew!). Oh and people play multiplayer. Much more beleivable than a rich kid part boy turned into a killer overnight(see sequel).			"

												FIRST: THIS GAME HAS FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT! BUT IT ISN'T LISTED! (I DON'T KNOW WHY IT ISN'T LISTED...) FANTASTIC game.  Atmosphere is its BEST quality.  Just running around the jungles, deserts, and savannahs is a joy.  Then you get plenty of good action.  And stealth!  VERY effectively-executed stealth gameplay.  The large areas and varied atmospheres give you plent of room to plan your strikes.  All animations and graphics are very good, even fitting realistic motions that a person's head would make!  The combat is fairly standard semirealistic shooting except for the large spaces, but the atmosphere and freedom make combat a discovery in the wilderness.  Discover and survive.			"

												far drive 2, I mean far cry 2, is a sandbox GTA-style shooter set in some african desert-jungle where you travel miles and miles and miles for each mission to merely shoot a guy or blow something up. and each time you hop into a car or jeep, you're tailed by some angry black men who want you ♥♥♥♥ing dead. I could sum up the game like that<, but that would be a bit boring, wouldn't it, let alone pessimistic as all hell. to put it more cheerfully: far cry 2 is a game that is as frustrating as it is enjoyable. make what you want out of that description. for a game where you're doing a ♥♥♥♥ of a lot of travelling, I have to admit that it pulls it all off rather well. the good thing about this system is that the map is lovely and big (it's very geographically diverse too which is even better), meaning you're not going to feel isolated in a tiny urban city area like you might feel when playing a game like saints row or GTA 4. the problem with the large degree of travel, however, is that you can only save your progress pretty much *after* you've beaten a mission. that's a huge problem because if you're travelling what literally seems like miles just to reach the objective, and you die in the heat of a shootout that follows, that means you have to go back to the beginning and disregard the fact that you've just wasted about half an hour of your precious life. either this is a pretty thrilling mechanic where you actually have a lot on the line, or it will send your controller routinely flying through the air.the graphics are surprisingly very crisp, especially for a game made in 2008. I played this game for years on the xbox 360 and the upgrade in picture quality on the PC is quite remarkable. if you had told me this game was only a few years old, I'd happy believe you, because it really does look good for its time. the enemy AI, while very responsive, can be quite bipolar. sometimes I swear the enemies have ♥♥♥♥ing spidey-senses and will spot you from about 100 feet away, even when you're only poking your head out from beyond a tree. they give enemies on MGS4's boss extreme settings a run for their money, that's for sure. but in other situations, you might come walking amongst them for a good 20 seconds until they actually realise that you're the enemy. it's quite a strange AI system. the gameplay itself, disregarding this, is pretty addictive, at least when you're on a winning streak. you can upgrade your weapons in a significant manner by doing side missions and this actually feels as if you're beefing up your character which gives this game a layer of RPG elements. you'll need to beef up your character too or else the game is going to absolutely slaughter you, especially if you're playing on at least normal difficulty. thankfully, these side missions are a nice break from the main story line. the vehicles, too, are very open for your usage and if you wanted to get from point A to B in, say, a boat, or a hang glider, it's all possible, but admittedly either finding the alternative vehicles is challenging or they simply aren't up to scratch (especially the boats when they crawl up the rivers like a ♥♥♥♥ing slug until you hit top speed). the currency system as well, which is rough diamonds, is also pretty nice, and it means you aren't limited to just getting the means to upgrade your rig by doing the missions in that diamonds can be found in the wild. lastly, the buddy system is a really nice new feature in such a game which I think delivers a huge deal of depth for a shooter like this. when your buddies stick their neck out for you and end up getting killed, it really is a sad sight to behold.oh, and did I mention dat map editor? good sweet jesus. pretty outstanding if you ask me. if you wanted to play sims creator mode but in far cry 2 instead, this is how you do it. and it's pretty fun. sure, it might be more trouble than it's worse when it will take you a massive amount of time to create a map that isn't shockingly bad, but so long as you're patient, like you'll need to be in all other departments in far cry 2, then it's worth the investment. evidently, far drive 2 is a flawed game. nobody can deny that. but it offers something GTA and its army of clones (saints row, sleeping dogs, red dead, etc) can't: an actual ♥♥♥♥ing challenge. sure, challenging games can only be challenging if they are occasionally frustrating, maddening and infuriating, but at the end of the day, I'd rather an experience like this where I feel like I'm actually a mortal human than some unkillable son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ - the former is a lot more fulfilling, and thankfully, far drive 2 isn't so challenging that it's unplayable. I'd compare the experience to the dark soul games - it's definitely a test of endurance. if you're an instant gratification style gamer - this game will get a 6 for you, if that. if you're a player who appreciates a good challenge where you actually have to sit tight and be patient - boost this game up to a 9 at max. personally, I'm tending towards the latter end with a 8/10 - not recommended for everybody, but it will definitely please a certain niche.

												7.5/10Great game when it comes to gunplay and amount of collectables, nice looking world, good sound quality. A few love or hate mechanics like breaking weapons, but there are ways to make sure you always have a gun. I loved these, btw. The only thing bringing it down is, the first half of the game seemed a little repetitive, unless you go out of your way to experiment with different playstyles, but I still found it fun. Also, it had a very weak ending imo.			"

												My game is quite buggy and I'm not sure why.  Maybe it's Windows 10 or something else.  The game actually seems like it would be pretty cool to play if it works.  Without a doubt I'd recommend this game if I could actually play it.  It's not as fluid as the newer Far Cry's, but who gives af; this is Far Cry history!  Hopefully it works for you.  Buy it on sale just in case.UPDATE:If you notice characters not staying on the ground or their heads moving from left-to-right like they're shaking their head 'no', lower the display settings and this should fix the issue.  I changed mine from ultra/high to Low and turned off some of the features and viola, the bugs stopped and the NPCs preformed as intended.  Hope this helps.  Enjoy FC2!			"

												The ""FUUUUUUCK This Ending Better Be Good"" game..........the ending was good.Getting CONS out of the way:Very tedious missions, enemies losing you when you are near their face, pebbles can stop and even damage your vehicle, ♥♥♥♥ING ENEMY OUTPOSTS EVERYWHERE, and long destinations making this game a bit longer to finish. However, PROS:For a dated game the scenery and the asthetics are gorgeous, really nailed Africa with its trees, landscapes, foliage and roaming animals. Buildings, bridges, and other structures keeps you immersed the entire time. Sound quality surprised me, the ambient animal noises, rain and waterfalls were great to hear. Design aside, the gunplay and constant firefights kept the playthrough very entertaining. JEEPS EVERYWHERE but was fitting. Good variety of weapons allowing you to enjoy a different style of attacking a group of enemies whenever you want (This game is not that well into stealth attacks, more for receiving the upper hand in fights).Story was great all the way through, lots of lefts and rights keeping you engaged and wanting to progress til the very end.You can shave off tons of hours on your playthorugh by not completing the extra (blue) missions.Yea it's good, get it on a sale. Play it. It's fun.			"

												What I liked:- Attention to detail: Wildfires spread, crappy guns jam, foliage conceals you. So many things are unexpectedly realistic.- Novel setting: Very few games are set in an African landscape, and this one pretty much makes it a main character.- Total immersion: There are no forced third-person cutscenes, and the HUD only appears when needed or when you press the ""Reload"" key.What I didn't care for:- Buddies are fragile: You can only successfully rescue a near-death buddy three times. This means you have to metagame if you want to keep a buddy alive.Recommendations:- Don't worry about having played the first Far Cry beforehand; there are no story ties between that game and this one.- Play it like Fallout 3 or Red Faction Guerrilla, not like Call of Duty or Gears of War. Explore, take side missions, and approach fights tactically rather than recklessly.- Turn off the music; it's not bad music, but it causes you to miss subtle audio cues.			"

												I bought Far Cry 2 for $3.39 about three days ago on steam and let me tell you thats a steal. I got about 20 hours of gameplay out of it and I bet you could get more if you weren't like me. (I used -GameProfile_GodMode 1 as soon as I finished the tutorial) So essentially I didn't die a single time in the game. I enjoy games when I'm unstoppable and here's why I think you should get this game. (For no more than $5 otherwise your wasting money). The game is fun as the story goes back and forth and you face moral dillemmas. The game gives you the illusion of choice however. It tells you to complete a mission you can do this or that. But it ultimately doesn't mean anything as you will be forced into the same outcome. Its just the means of reaching that outcome. The story lets you think you are writing it and participating, but you aren't, you're just following along. The game's missions do get repetitive as its only assassinate this guy or blow this thing up. I payed $3 and cheated through the whole game so I wasn't expecting too much. As for replayability, its a Far Cry game so there is none. Also there are no achievements which give me no incentive to find stuff or kill guard posts. In Far Cry  3, there were achievements, and I was playing on Xbox so achievements mean something, so there was a reason to go do something in the game. Since I finished the game 5 mins ago, I don't think I'll be revisiting it. BUT, it was worth all 339 of my pennies and I would gladly pay 339 pennies for another Far Cry game. It is what it is, a shoot em up with nice scenary so don't expect too much.			"

												EDIT: I suggest giving Far Cry 3 a look. I hear it's pretty similar to this one but better in most ways. Compare some videos to decide which one you want.First thing's first: it's a shallow game. It could have been better in many ways. They could have made the world more lively. They could have tried a bit harder with the missions. They could have made a better story. They could have (done much more), but they didn't. I haven't looked into it, so consider this anecdotal in the purest form, but I would wager that it was rushed for release or held back by being designed for consoles.One thing you'll notice is that the game is still beautiful 7 years down the road, and despite being a game made for consoles first. The shadows, while not as fine as modern games, are still extremely efficient for how good looking they are, which is what mostly contributes to the beauty of the game. You can play on highest settings and still get very good performance on any semi-modern PC. One of the ways they get such great performance out of good shadows is the clever way they hide the level of detail scaling. If you pay attention during the opening cutscene when the trucks pass in front of you -on ultra- you'll notice how the shadows under them disappear very quickly. In regular play, this is almost entirely hidden by clever level design with high usage of obfuscation; that is to say, very compartmentalized to a big wide open area with a limited amount of ""dynamic"" shadow objects like cars and characters, supplemented with great-looking grass everywhere and clever usage of trees. The grass and trees, which move and react semi-dynamically to random wind patterns, produce seemingly dynamic shadows (don't know exactly if they are dynamic or static; if it's dynamic, it's extremely efficient on resources; if it's static, they look very dynamic) that react particularly well with the pretty lighting method the game uses. Remember: It was made first and foremost for the limited hardware of the Xbox 360. They deload all rendering of areas you are no longer in while keeping the areas still loaded in memory so there is no loading time, keeping the game openworld. All of the system load in the game is due to graphical fidelity, very low CPU usage is observed due to the mechanics of the game, which works perfectly for consoles which have subpar CPUs but usually good GPUs to keep down prices. You'll notice that console games are rarely complex for CPU-based actions like lots of pathfinding enemies; just an observation I wanted to point out, totally unrelated to this review.The game is ""atmospheric"" and ""immersive"", since I'm tired and don't know a more clever way to describe it. It pulls you in and really makes you feel like you're in Africa. It really ""feels"" hot and dry. You can ""feel"" the heat applied by the light on your character's arm. The sound design is incredibly detailed, and the beauty of the world never strains your suspension of disbelief.The gameplay is shallow and underrealized. As the Steam review of the game, by the user Koltraiin had said, ""No elephants, Lions, Cheetahs, Snakes, Crocodiles."" This is indicative of the shallowness of the game; they could have given it more, but it simply wasn't there. With all this in mind, I find the game fun to play. It's a unique experience for a unique game, and despite being shallow in gameplay it's a great deal for 10 dollars and it goes on sale fairly often. The biggest downside to the game is being a Ubisoft title, and requiring a Ubisoft account to play online.			"

												Edit:Alright, finally finished it. It became slightly repetitive towards the end, and the ending itself wasn't that great, but I had a good time playing it. Probably won't repeat it, but it's still recommended./EditI'm in the process of finishing this game and I'm having a great time.To new players: Make sure you install the Dylan realism mod and then crank the difficulty UP a bit, because the mod will make you damage people more realistically (they won't survive direct headshots anymore, for example).And to be clear, I absolutely LOATHED the checkpoints the first time I played, and subsequently hated the game. After some time away I gave it another shot and quickly got over it being annoying, simply by following the advice from this article: http://majorslack.com/games-tips-tricks/having-fun-playing-far-cry-2/Taking it more slowly when approaching checkpoints on foot, or just cutting corners or taking shortcuts when driving on the roads, or getting ready to gun them down with the mounted weapon on your vehicle, will help you immensely with the checkpoints.After a while it got so easy for me avoiding them that I started having fun by creating the most sadistic ways of taking them out, like wounding one guy in the leg to lure out others trying to help him, only for me to pick them off one by one with my trusty sniper rifle, or getting the grenade webbing upgrade and tossing a truckload of grenades into every nook and cranny I could find, blowing everything to smithereens and listening to the ensuing screams of terror.Then driving my jeep away, looking forward to toy my way through the next encounter while enjoying the beautiful scenery around me as the sun came up or went down in the horizon.As long as you FOLLOW THE TIPS IN THAT ARTICLE and install the REALISM MOD you're gonna have a game with awesome and gritty atmosphere which any other game will have a hard time matching.

												[Played on Hardest difficulty setting with music off]If you're a fan of Far Cry 3 and are interested in trying this one out, be warned that it might not be what you're expecting.  It's more closely related to games like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. than any of the other games in the Far Cry series.  It's brutally unforgiving and slanted more towards realism and immersion than action-adventure.  The world is large, but exploration isn't necessarily a large part of the gameplay, as the only real purpose for doing so is finding diamonds, hidden tapes, and golden guns -- none of which are particularly essential to the experience of the game.At its core, the game is about tense gunfights and missions, and the different tactics you can use to ensure your survival.  The game has a robust array of different systems that organically create compelling moments -- last second escapes into the jungle while bullets whiz past you, guns jamming at the least opportune moment and forcing you to flee for the nearest sign of cover, buddies arriving just in the nic of time to save you from an otherwise unwinnable firefight, enemies whom you thought you had killed crawling to their knees and shooting you in the back for revenge -- the list goes on and on, and I'm still discovering new possibilities after hours of play.  Playing with the music turned off increases the tension in the game IMMENSELY, as you never know if there's an enemy around you just waiting for the perfect time to blast you apart and ruin the last ten minutes of progress you'd made.  You'll find yourself checking every corner, listening intently for footsteps or enemy chatter, and cursing yourself when you inevitably miss that lone gunman who finishes you off as soon as you step into the open.The narrative of the game is also smart and very sensible and aware of the topics which it brings up, which is a helluva lot more than you can say for most modern military shooters.  Don't expect to leave this one feeling like the hero.tldr;It's absolutely brilliant, especially if you're into S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-like games and emergent gameplay.			"

												This is a very good open world FPS.  The strongest aspect of the Far Cry series has always been the ability to attack the missions/challenges in any way you see fit; Far Cry 2 allows you to decide how you're going to take on the bad guys.  Run N' Gun?  Stealth?  Snipe everybody (my personal favorite)?The only negative about the game is the lack of Fast Travel between points you've already discovered.  There's a LOT of driving/walking/boating/swimming that you'll have to do in order to get around the world, but it's not so huge that this becomes a real issue.  You can get to the corners and center of the map via bus stations, but the rest of the time you'll be responsible for getting yourself where you want to go.So get out there and start tracking down The Jackal.  He's not a very nice person, and no one will miss him when he's gone... "

												Big Improvement graphically over the Far Cry, but game play is pretty bland and there are some major bugs. NPCs will rise into the air at random and if they are outdoors will fall and die. I was able to complete an assassination mission without firing a shot because my target did this. There's not much variety in the missions, either drive halfway across the map and shoot someone, or drive halfway across the map and grab an item after shooting someone.			"

												Far cry 2 is, let's say... less than ideal. Long ago I had even anticipated this game to be absolutely awesome, reality however didn't meet my expectations. The original Far cry at the time it appeared was a masterpiece that I enjoyed immensely. It was absolutely gorgeous, engaging to play and overall it just felt good. Far cry number two however falls short or gets you annoyed in several different parts. First of all when I started playing, I wasn't expecting it to be an Africa based awful driving simulator. There's way too much driving around in an open world that has little less activities to do than to shoot at everyone because everyone is extremely mad at you for existing. The world feels empty. How the AI works and behaves is questionable and because the enemy guys' bare chests are actually kevlar or something even sturdier you find yourself asking is this game really a game worth playing. I would go as far to say that it isn't. Too much repetition, too much boring driving and too much forced confrontations with foes that merely want to slow your progress in an annoying way (destroying the engine of your car so you have to stop and fix it). It isn't all bad however. It brings up some interesting points in the story off how cruel a civil war truly is, the greed of mankind and all sorts of nasty things. The game can look pretty freaking beautiful at times especially on daytime. Some of the guns feel pretty nice to shoot until they jam or break completely and won't shoot anymore. I did finish the game and at the end I felt both relief and contentment. There are just a lot more and better FPS games to be had than this. Don't waste your time. The predecessor of Far Cry 2 was a better game and so is the successor as well. Better to spend your money on something completely different. Or maybe similar but better if the type of game ticks well with you.			"

												Its an older game so it runs good on my budget Toshiba laptop. Environment looks beatiful for a game. Minor gun complaint - the G3K A4 rifle you get should have the same specs as the FAL since they fire the same cartridge in real life and both are capable of taking down a man at 600 meters or further and are basically 1 or 2 shot kills. But Its still interesting/fun in the beginning stages! I'm playing on easy because I'm a wuss and play for fun. The vehicle dynamics are improved from FC1, but are still a pain sometimes, but the fact that you can repair them (with one bolt!) is a hoot! Using the map is cool, but a bit clunky and hard to see while avoiding trees. Go blow stuff up and shoot badguys!(Updated: Aug31-2015)Finished it. (Spoilers ahead) here's what I felt:Basically the game punishes you for playing it well. If you want to finish the game, you cannot just pick a side based on a moral choice: ""Which side (UFLL or APR) behave morally and harm fewer civillians?"" No - its all about murdering all the other mercs (like you) for money. The game devs decided to make your amoral (immoral, some might argue) character (whichever you choose to play as doesnt matter a bit) fatally flawed in all important areas of the game:1) Before you even begin playing, you automatically contract Malaria. So your health is compromised from Day 1. The rest of the game forces you to do humanitarian missions for the Underground (the only ""faction"" that is for actually helping unarmed citizens) in order to aquire Malaria meds in order for you to stay alive so that you can kill even more mercenaries...on both sides. What if I wanted to work exclusively for the Underground...like ""The Machine Gun Preacher""?  (A movie based on a real guy in Africa.) Nope. Can't. Stuck being a selfish A-hole murderer.2) Before you even start playing (again) You become a stupid, failed TOOL. Not only do you immediately fail in your mission to ""kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that is arming both sides"" - the idea based on a flawed moral statement built upon the liet: ""Guns kill people, not the men pulling the triggers...so therefore to secure peace, we must remove guns."", (which makes it SEEM like the player-character has SOME moral compass) but no, you end up unwittingly working for the Jackal the whole game untill the unescapable, unalterable end. You're just a stupid PAWN!3) Before you even begin playing (AGAIN) You are predestined to be an ammoral murderer who only exists to kill everyone else you see - eventually even your ""friends"" whom you have saved and who save you numerous times throughout the entire game and yet, they all make the snap decision based on BS to just betray and kill you (and they just spawn in from space apprently too). And the game gives you no choice but to finish them off instead of healing/sparing them. I hated finishing this game. I thought I'd get to feel good about the character by the end, (I played as Paul - the Israeli). I thought I'd get to see him GROW as a person - maybe to become a merciful mercenary, who decides: ""Even though violence has its place in this messed up world (that is undeniable)  I will CHOOSE a side in this conflict based on moral absolutes. And by these guidelines, I choose how to live, fight, and die..."" It shouldn't be based on money, or the ravings of a greedy, dying lunatic Arms Dealer. But the game Devs said: ""WRONG! WE will force you to be a martyr no matter which path (detonate dynomite or deliver diamond bribe to border guards) you choose - You will still kill yourself."" Stupid...especially when one path could have easily allowed the player to live. But all my choices were made for me before I even began playing. AT LEAST I DIE SAVING REFUGEES AND NOT MURDERING THEM!!! Thank you for throwing me that bone, Ubisoft. But mostly its like Ubisoft is saying: ""Thanks for buying Far Cry 2, an excericise in moral-dilemas with no ""good ending"". Enjoy wasting 80 hours of your life as you wander aimlessly through this open world, killing everything you see untill...we make you kill yourself.  F^#k you, Murdurer!""			"

												Modern shooters have become little more than corridor crawls. You enter a mission and are funneled through the map with almost no deviation available. As far as the possibility of ""next-gen"" world building goes, shooters are stuck in a rut. Interestingly enough, Ubisoft made a valiant effort to push the FPS genre forward back in 2008.Far Cry 2 is one of the most invigorating ideas for a shooter that I've ever played. It doesn't always succeed in it's ambition, but the sense of freedom and the massive size of the world lend themselves to some fantastic moments. Those moments are spread a bit thin, though.While the very first thing you do in the game has an objective, the next 16 hours are pretty much you exploring. There are light story elements driving some of your actions, but you would be forgiven for not knowing that a plotline even exists. Your starting goal is simply ""Kill the Jackal"" and that is about as far as the narrative goes.This is the biggiest flaw with the game. There is no urgency in anything you are doing. You could easily spend years combing over every inch of the game world and never feel obligated or inclined to tackle any missions. While that is very intriguing as a launching point, it makes for a game that feels lackadaisical and pointless.When you do take up a mission, that is when the game starts to breathe. The fast travel spots are rarely convenient, so you are (almost always) forced to find your own path. The in-game map can help you from getting lost, but it doesn't point out any direction to you. You simply need to chart your own course.During your travel to the objective spot, you often run into bandits. This emergent style of gameplay leads to some fantastic shoot outs that have you scrambling for your life. These moments do happen a bit too often to stay truly enveloping, but barely dodging a missile and sniping guys across a chasm never cease to be quick fixes of joy.When you finish a mission, you simply are left with nothing. The currency system in this game is almost entirely worthless. Since your weapons can break down or jam at random intervals, it makes some sense to want to buy fresh ones that you can replenish. Seeing as how you run out of ammo fairly quick, there doesn't seem to be a need to buy those weapons; just grab them off the endless amounts of bodies you pile up.There is also the threat of malaria consuming you, which can make for some tense shootouts where a question of your mortality comes into play. Honestly, though, apart from some flashy effects on the screen, the whole malaria side of the game seems like an excuse to extend the length. You have to undertake missions devoid of originality to get more medication and it just ends up feeling like wasted time.I find it hard to remain angry at this game. It took me several months to muster up the desire to even see the conclusion, but the moments of bliss I encountered cannot be understated. I can't think of any game on current generation systems that even comes close to capturing the amount of freedom you are given.Developers love to throw around the claim that their game will allow you to ""go anywhere and see anything."" Ubisoft is pretty much the only one that let you do this. Traveling through most of Far Cry 2, though, you begin to wonder if you really want to see every facet of the map.All in all, I won't say the game is bad. I don't even think it's bad. While there are some crashes here and there, everything works as it should. Enemies are sometimes smart and I never fell through the gameworld. I just wished I could travel around faster. I would also have loved to have a sense that my actions were doing something.For the average gamer, though....I would take a pass. A game like Far Cry 2 takes a lot of maturity to conquer. It's joys are not quick and easy to obtain. A lot of effort needs to happen on the player's part to make anything of this game. If you're willing to sit through some rough terrain, you'll eventually find the diamond in the rough that lies at the core of Far Cry 2.6/10			"

												Having already played far cry 3 and 4 i had a pretty bias/high expectations for this game but it did dissapoint in some areas. The story is fine but it's very linear style gets boring after a few hours and feels more like a call of duty campagin for example get the mission/ kill the guys and repeat. Athough its an open world game some points of the map makes you feel enclosed and forces you to stay near the roads. After 3 hours i got really board of driving everywhere, the game really discourages exploration in my opinion, the outpost can be scouted but the enemies never go away and that get annoying when you just wana get to your destination. the map lacks a lot of interative feature with very few side mission, unlockables, collectables, crafting, etc. in my 20 hours first play through i did very few side mission and barely explored after 3 hours. i will be generous since you can get this game for very cheap but i would not pay a full 60 for something that  in todays market the feels unfinshed. Far cry 3 basically used the same formula but makes an terrific campaign and a immersive world with many things to distract you from doing the main story .final verdict 7/10			"

												I really enjoy playing it - its slow, its unforgiving - its not polished, but it is great fun, exploration, fire, blood and diamonds - and it looks so sweet with SweetFX enabled, you will love it. give it a try, I missed it in 2008, and now with every graphic option maxed out, I am having a blast! cheers			"

												While this game is pretty fun, it is simply outclassed by Far Cry 3.The missions in this game are similar to GTA 4... drive to this place, shoot this person, recieve diamonds. As such, there is not a very good storyline compared to Far Cry 3, where every mission takes place for a reason, and you feel like you've progressed every time you complete a mission.The AI and detection is a little janky, much smoother in Far Cry 3, and there is no detection meter in this game to tell you if you're being seen. Taking over outposts is also a finicky business, sometimes you take them over by walking around them, sometimes you can kill the inhabitants, wait up to 10 minutes and still nothing!It could be that I'm misinformed and playing it wrong, however as it is now Far Cry 3 is far superior and better value for money. Speaking of money, the only way to earn it in this game is through completing missions or finding it in chests around the map, there is no looting enemies. This seems a little weird, so if you want to buy a new pistol, you have to go complete an entire mission or go hunting for boxes of diamonds.The map is much larger however, and as open world games go this is rather good. Combat isn't all that bad, a decent variety of guns, and driving is a lot better than other games.All in all, I'd give it 4 out of 10, although I'll re-review this game after completing it most likely.

												The build up for this one after being in the works for several years was still one of the biggest slated releases for me as a gamer, but fell short in the delivery. Quote from one of my friends who got his hands on it when it came out; he said he was ""Bored"" within the first 2 days of getting it. It didnt offer very much innovation at the time besides the story based narative and such. The actual firefights were bland and the AI didnt make for very exciting gun fights. But one thing was clear, the graphics for its time were benchmarking quality. Nothing to compare to todays standards, anyone looking at this one should probably buy Far Cry 3 instead.			"

												I got this after Far Cry 3 just to experience more of the series. This has a different feel than FC3. More of a raw, gritty, type of atmosphere that is frustratingly fun. Good story line and a nice selection of weapons. Guard shacks always respawn so it's never ""safe"" to just cruise down the road to your next objective. Random enemies patrolling in vehicles will constantly be a thorn in your side but that's part of the fun. Enemies aren't always easy to spot. They'll hide in the trees and shrubs and they're clothing will annoyingly blend in to the environment around them. I can't count the number of times I've nearly died just trying to figure out where the hell I'm being shot from. Nothing like thinking you have an area cleared out and then have a wounded mercenary sit up, pull a side arm and start giving one last ditch effort to off you.			"

												Jumping is crap and several diamond-filled briefcases are either impossible to get, or I lack the creativity and jumping skills to get them.With that out of the way, there is no game like Farcry 2. It is a game about violence. It is not a game about violence. You are the good guy out to kill the bad guy. You are the bad guy out to kill the good guy. You have friends, or do you? There is a moral choice; there is no moral choice. If you don't understand my mutterings, play the game and you will. For a game that provides chaotic combat and satisfying action, it also provides its thoughts on war and human nature. A wonderful game to play mindlessly, and a wonderful game to play knowing full well what you're doing in game.			"

												Far Cry 2 is tedious, but if you value immersion above being fast-paced then you'd be hard pressed to find a better game. The empowerment you feel from playing the game comes from you persevering through mechanics that have been made more difficult than it is in typical FPS games by integrating real-world aspects, sometimes to unrealistic extremes. Playing through the campaign at max difficulty (makes you about as squishy as every NPC mook) with the music turned off (when you're on a far hill quietly picking off enemies one by one, hearing intense combat music play definitely throws you out of the moment).-Your ""reputation"" acts as your EXP level in the game, and generic NPC's react accordingly. Guards will tell you to f*ck off and frequently threaten you at the beginning of the game, but as you level up their dialogue will descend into professional respect and then to superstitious fear.-The HUD is very intentionally limited; the only onscreen effects are your health and ammo and they quickly fade when not in use. The map and compass have to be brought up like a weapon, and simulate a real paper map with pages of different scales. Sometime's it's a pain in the ♥♥♥ to be at the very bottom of a map section and not be able to see a decent area around you, but it's frustration with something that would be in real life, not frustration with some contrived immersion-breaking game mechanic so it only adds to the immersion.-You have to drive everywhere on the map but destinations are often close together and the geocaching side-quests, constant threat of ambush, and the detail put into making the ""HUD"" map feel real keep transportation from being boring. It's a rush to be looking down at your map, hear a close gunshot, and jolt back to the road to see a patrol that just came around the corner.-Guns start to jam around after you fire your very limited ammo capacity, but it forces you to plan ahead like a true professional and make full use of your 3 weapons slots. Necessity is the mother of invention, and the situations where you're completely surrounded with everything but your pistol broken because you weren't efficient with your shots make the game memorable. Likewise, the feeling of satisfaction when an outpost hit comes together perfectly because you stored the right backup loadout in your safehouse really seals the deal that you're a true professional and an unstoppable force.-Despite the game's difficulty, it's very feasible to beat the game without dying. The PC's that you didn't choose to play as can be encountered in-game and and turned into allies, and will rescue you if your health drops to 0. They're not invincible though, and they needed to be protected then met in a safehouse if you want to be rescued again by them.Far Cry 2 quickly became one of my favorite games because of how it sucked me in, made me feel weak, and then let me slowly adapt to it until I truly felt like the hardcore motherf*cker that I was supposed to be playing. 10/10, would recommend to anyone who wants to get absolutely submerged in a game.

												Fun game, as with other posts, the AI is iffy.  But, I think they are trying to get the point across that these people are not trained soldiers and will shoot at shadows, some AI seem to work better than others, i e. the foreign mercs.  This game has a GTA feel to it, except in Africa, so everyone is hostile.  When I started the game I thought people would only be hostile if you were hostile to them.  No no no my friend.  Apparently, in Africa, everyone hates everyone.   The game is more blissful than pleasurable.  It keeps you thinking, the story doesnt explain what to do, it just goes.  My slavic buddy is a bullet magnet resulting in a morphene overdose.  The driving is fun, some of the random AI in Russian Ladas cruising the country side are jokes, as it seems these people are just like you, trying to make their way in a wasteland, only to have their dreams crushed under the weight of my 50 cal mounted machine gun.  IEDs are fun. (dont look too far into that Mr. NSA).  Ambushing is easier with camo upgrade.			"

												As far as I'm concerned, this was the game that addicted me to the ""survival shooter"" genre and I have never encountered another game with the same realistic-yet-stylised approach which both allowed the feeling of general superiority over enemies while still maintaining a sense of mortality and real danger. Not quite as gritty as S.T.A.L.K.E.R. but also not an overpowered player character experience like Crysis. Both are also great games, but this is the uniquely satisfying middle ground.Being an older game, it is more limited by its engine in many regards, such as enemies' strange ability to see the player from incredible distances and snipe with improbable accuracy, but forgiving it the wrinkles of it's age, it's still a great experience and one I would recommend to anyone interested in a realistically-influenced shooter without the complications of ""hyper-realism"".

But those two things are exactly why I love this game.In most FPS games these days, you play some kind of super soldier that can't possibly lose. Those games are for babies.Far Cry 2 drops you into the world and trows everything it has at you. Only the strong can survive this game, and that is why it is so rewarding, even now in 2016.			"

Great gameplay, cool setting, all the guns are great, the road-side enemy camps aren't that annoying, enemies aren't invincible, it has great graphics, very few bugs, and will work on many systems. For $9.99, with all DLC, this is an awesome value and I'd recomend it to any Far Cry fan.			"

Hi there. I can't say this game is good or bad because it's somewhere in the middle. It's a long game but exactly because of this it's more boring because most of the missions are the same. A new feature which I didn't see in other Far Cry games is that you can gain friends by story and lose them as well and if you have some when you die, they will come for you and revive you and save you. That's pretty cool. The story is cool and weird at the same time. I understood the idea of it but the way they show you this story is even a bit horrible >.> Also a new system of jamming the guns is kinda annoying. Also NPCs are annoying as well. They will find you everywhere regardless of how long you ride from them. I can recommend this game but with a big discount.P.S.: Far Cry 1 still better than this :) "

												The build up for this one after being in the works for several years was still one of the biggest slated releases for me as a gamer, but fell short in the delivery. Quote from one of my friends who got his hands on it when it came out; he said he was ""Bored"" within the first 2 days of getting it. It didnt offer very much innovation at the time besides the story based narative and such. The actual firefights were bland and the AI didnt make for very exciting gun fights. But one thing was clear, the graphics for its time were benchmarking quality. Nothing to compare to todays standards, anyone looking at this one should probably buy Far Cry 3 instead.			"

												Beats the ♥♥♥♥ out of 3 in my opinion. This game is a lot like STALKER in that it doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about you. It sort of throws you out into the world and says ""Good luck."" This isn't the cinematic ""The world revolves around you"" type of game FC3 was. There's no skill trees or press Q to heal all your HP (aside from limited syringes you carry 3 of that can only be replenished by finding them) or free wallhack or crafting system, but if you're into the hard as ♥♥♥♥ but extremely rewarding with various ways to be played type of game, then this is for you.There are a few things common complaints about this game for and I think they're exaggerated and full of ♥♥♥♥.Malaria - I seriously think people are just looking for ♥♥♥♥ to add to their list of ♥♥♥♥♥ing. Malaria turns your screen yellow and eventually killing you, and you have to take a pill to make it go away (you have 5-7 pills I forget exactly how many). This happens every 40 minutes to an hour I think. The game will warn you when you're on your last pill to, and they're easy to get (go to the church, church will tell you to rescue people a.k.a kill the 2-4 guards outside of a house, the people will give you the pills)Weapon jamming - I seriously don't even know how this was an issue for anyone. Heres how it works: If your gun is rusted as ♥♥♥♥ it's prone to jamming, and if it jams too many times it can break. Guns you find lying on the ground are always rusted to hell, and guns get from the store (which gives you an infinite supply to replace yours with) are always in mint condition. They take a LONG time to degrade. So if you run out of ammo and need to use an enemies gun then get ready for the risks.Driving all the way across the map with respawning bases- This is another thing that's exaggerated as ♥♥♥♥. There's a bus system, that's like the stider system in morrowind but free, that can take you to every corner of the map and the center. The only thing that might make it tedious is the respawning checkpoints, but if you use the bus system you'll only have to clear 1-3.Cars breaking down - I think this was an issue for me once every 5 hours of gameplay, and when my car did break down I just jacked the car from whoever shot it up.Here are the ACTUAL flaws with the game IMO:Enemy AI: The AI is so smart it's not even funny, but theres one key problem. If one enemy sees you they ALL see you, this means if one enemy can see you in a shed then his 5 friends know exactly where you are and shoot you through the shed. Not a serious problem unless you're in an area with permeable cover (kinda rare). This is a serious problem though when snipers show up. In farcry 3 the snipers have a laser, but they don't in 2, so later in the game when you get to snipers all the sudden the entire enemy base knows exactly where you are and you have no idea why.Repetition: This wasn't an issue for me because I usually mixed things up, but this game is VERY repetetive. You will visit very different elaborately layed out levels, but to do the same thing. There's basically 4 types of missions they give you (assassinate, blow up convoy, save people, blow up/steal something in a base). Sometimes you'll revisit the same area for a different type of mission. Most of the areas have 3 ways to approach them, and theres a variety of weapons to mix your playing style.			"

												Far Cry 2 is a handful of good ideas buried under one of the most repetitive games I've ever played. Given the recent trend of reviewers re-examining it and declaring it some sort of misunderstood masterpiece I decided to buy it again (I'd lost my disk ages back) and give it another go. As I remembered it mostly consists of driving a vehicle backwards and forwards around the same parts of the map with the same 3-4 annoying AI troops respawning in the exact same areas and attacking you. If killed they'll simply respawn in their checkpoint ready to chase you next time and ignoring them simply results in them following you forever.Degradation is a nice idea but once your weapons have degraded you have to DRIVE BACK to the arms dealer again since picking up extra weapons from dead enemies is worthless (they are always in horrible condition). To even get weapons in the armoury you have to:A. Do a side mission to unlock the weapons for purchase (more driving to get there and back).B. Find diamonds to pay for the weapons (even more ♥♥♥♥ing driving).You do get small moments of fun now and then. Stealth, for example, sometimes works brilliantly but just as often the AI decides to spot me at random and then everyone in the area will magically know your position. I've got nothing against harder stealth but STALKER did it better even with its flaws. Some of the missions are fun too but most are fairly forgettable firefights.The game would likely have worked much better as a series of linear missions with a semi-open map for each (i.e. Far Cry 1). As usual open world here just means repetitive and empty.Buddy mechanics and the general atmosphere are the only good points but all the atmosphere in the world couldn't make up for the complete boredom of actually playing this game.Finally to add insult to injury the game is buggy as ♥♥♥♥, particularly the tutorial. Activating the DLC is an annoyance also. You might have to spend 1-2 hours hunting for fixes and replaying the unskippable intro/tutorial until it works (10+ minutes every time). As mentioned above the AI also varies between being completely blind and cheating depending largely on their alert status.			"

There is a story (though I haven't finished it, almost though) which is fairly good, it's not the greatest though.

												This was my absolute favorite game for a time on my Xbox 360, I've probably played atleast 100 hours of the game on Xbox. It's such an immersive world, it really feels like you are in Africa. The guns jamming are a great addition too and the fact that you have malaria is strangely awesome because it adds an element not found in other games; the constant chase for medicine and having to take pills mid-fight. I love the weapon upgrade system and the way that diamonds are the currency too. The game is a bit dated now and some features we are used to today don't exist, for example the world isn't very persistent. If you clear out a whole outpost, the enemies will just respawn so you have to clear it out or just drive straight through everytime you pass the outpost which is very aggrovating sometimes. Nevertheless it's a superb game and imo it's better than Far Cry 3 in some ways, not all though of course. More than absolutley worth it's price.			"

												As far as I'm concerned, Far Cry 2 deserves to be remembered alongside the venerated classics of the genre; Half-Life, Deus Ex, Bioshock, and all those other semi-legendary shooters. But at the same time, it's not entirely surprising that it isn't remembered that way.To use a really crappy pun, Far Cry 2 is, in many ways, a rough diamond. It might not shine, but it's just as solid and precious as any other of its kind.Let's start with the good, and the first good thing right off the bat about the game is the setting and atmosphere. How many other shooters take place in sub-Saharan Africa? It's a brilliant premise that's rarely explored in the genre. A war-torn, hostile, exotic setting populated by power-hungry warlords and psychotic mercs? There aren't many other real-world scenarios that would work better as an environment in which to set a shooter of this style, and I find it much more memorable than the exaggerated, tropical setting of Far Cry 3. By Far Cry 4 I was entirely disinterested in the franchise, and never played that game or any later ones. So I can't say anything about them. Far Cry 2's fictional setting is very believable, and the originality and thought put into it is apparent from the get-go.To go along with the great atmosphere are some genuinely impressive visuals, which might sound weird to those who have only briefly played the game. The vanilla color palette is just plain awful, but the effects, textures, models and shaders are all top-notch for a 2008 title, and the Dunia engine has a few nice tricks up its sleeve. A little tweaking with the Sweetfx shader suite goes a long way towards rectifying the brown, muddy colors and is absolutely essential to getting the most out of the graphics and the overall experience, and with the right tweaks the game has massive visual appeal to this day, even compared to some contemporaries like Crysis that are more well-known for their visuals. The graphics are stylized yet realistic without ever really feeling uncanny or too outdated. Again-aside from the questionable color palette-the care put into the visuals is apparent right from the start.All this would just be academic if not for gameplay to truly make the game worthwhile, and FC2 surely delivers in that regard as well. I've always considered Far Cry 2 to be a minimalist shooter, which might sound bizarre when you consider the massive, open world and whatnot. But at its core, there are only a few core elements driving the gameplay here. No shoehorned RPG elements, no crafting, very little NPC interaction, no player-influenced dialogue, not even much of a story. This minimalist, almost barebones approach to gameplay? Well, quite frankly, it's just plain fantastic. One thing I really disliked about Far Cry 3 was the degree of artificial progression in it. By which I mean the skill trees and crafting- this doesn't add flavor to the game as everyone ends up getting everything by the end and it just limits early-game creativity. One term that frequently comes to mind when I think about Far Cry 2 is ""emergent gameplay;"" that is, progression that is directed by the player instead of the game. There are unlocks and upgrades, yeah, and there is a reason to get them, but the most prominent progression in the game is that of your own playstyle. You start to learn what weapons, what routes, what tactics work the best for you and work from there- instead of being given a list of skills for your character. I'm a huge fan of the concept of character proficiency, but it just doesn't belong in a game like this, and the fact that Far Cry 2 is so aware of that is really refreshing. You never feel truly forced into a gameplay style or scenario you genuinely dislike, a problem many open-world games suffer from.The AI in Far Cry 2 is absolutely insane, to say the least. It's way too smart for its own good much of the time, and while this might seem cheap at times, it's also an excellent catalyst for the aforementioned emergent gameplay and player-directed progression. I remember starting out my initial play through trying to get up close and personal and stealthy, but the AI just isn't stupid enough for that to work. So I shifted to a more distant playstyle- sniping, picking off enemies, constantly on the move- interspersed with aggressive, ballsy assaults when the situation called for it or my position was compromised. Part of the gameplay is learning the AI's tricks and figuring out what works best for you. The AI is advanced enough that there are no glaring exploits to make the game too easy, but at the same time, if you're expecting a stealth shooter you're going to be disappointed. It really contributes to a feeling of overall cerebrality- you can be great at shooters but if you don't plan your moves you won't get far. It's worth mentioning by now that I've been playing with a realism mod on Infamous difficulty, which really is the only way to play as far as I'm concerned. The enemies are a little too spongy in vanilla, but the setup I use can be brutally difficult yet is rarely ever unfair. The gameplay requires analysis and personal experience and I can admit I was frustrated early game that nothing I did seemed to work- probably one of the biggest reasons this game isn't better remembered- but when you get it down the core gameplay is both elegantly simple and constantly engaging, while always feeling personally rewarding.Moving onto some of the weaker points, the sound design is a mixed bag, with guns sounding stock and animations not always syncing properly with sounds, but the ambient noise, dynamic soundtrack and enemy chatter are all pretty memorable.It was at this point in the review I ran out of mentally pre-rehearsed stuff to say. I'm not good at properly reviewing stuff. But yeah this game's rad so play it if it sounds like something you'd play.			"

												Should have been called driving across Africa.  Fast travel points (bus stations) are scattered and trips to the gun merchant feel unnecessary (should just phone in your order and have them waiting for you at your safe house).  Checkpoints are all over which is okay, but you can't shoot from your car unless on multi-player so you need to hop out at every one in addition to every single car on the road that immediately knows to kill you.  I would have liked an option to bribe guards with uncut diamonds as well, but that isn't an option.  Your safe house weapon crates contain one extra weapon of each type which you have to drop in there from the armory attached to the gun shop - so any of my dozen safe houses magically have a copy of the weapon, but I have to go back to the armory when the weapon breaks after enough use or I'm tired of it jamming all the time?Companions - there doesn't seem to be any point to doing their missions.  They add 1-2 small tasks to gain history with them, but then they easily die and also do not offer anything for having a high history.  Buddy rescue - where they come and save you after you get owned has a long cutscene you can't skip - you also don't cue your buddy rescue up until after you hit the safe house again instead of just automatically after some time.Missions are dull and repetitive - same mission for meds or gun runner every single time!  You also have to appear in person to start every story mission which just drags it out.  Your stealth options are a little limited as well.This game was probably okay in 2008, but really doesn't hold to current standards of a run and gun game.			"

												As far as I'm concerned, Far Cry 2 deserves to be remembered alongside the venerated classics of the genre; Half-Life, Deus Ex, Bioshock, and all those other semi-legendary shooters. But at the same time, it's not entirely surprising that it isn't remembered that way.To use a really crappy pun, Far Cry 2 is, in many ways, a rough diamond. It might not shine, but it's just as solid and precious as any other of its kind.Let's start with the good, and the first good thing right off the bat about the game is the setting and atmosphere. How many other shooters take place in sub-Saharan Africa? It's a brilliant premise that's rarely explored in the genre. A war-torn, hostile, exotic setting populated by power-hungry warlords and psychotic mercs? There aren't many other real-world scenarios that would work better as an environment in which to set a shooter of this style, and I find it much more memorable than the exaggerated, tropical setting of Far Cry 3. By Far Cry 4 I was entirely disinterested in the franchise, and never played that game or any later ones. So I can't say anything about them. Far Cry 2's fictional setting is very believable, and the originality and thought put into it is apparent from the get-go.To go along with the great atmosphere are some genuinely impressive visuals, which might sound weird to those who have only briefly played the game. The vanilla color palette is just plain awful, but the effects, textures, models and shaders are all top-notch for a 2008 title, and the Dunia engine has a few nice tricks up its sleeve. A little tweaking with the Sweetfx shader suite goes a long way towards rectifying the brown, muddy colors and is absolutely essential to getting the most out of the graphics and the overall experience, and with the right tweaks the game has massive visual appeal to this day, even compared to some contemporaries like Crysis that are more well-known for their visuals. The graphics are stylized yet realistic without ever really feeling uncanny or too outdated. Again-aside from the questionable color palette-the care put into the visuals is apparent right from the start.All this would just be academic if not for gameplay to truly make the game worthwhile, and FC2 surely delivers in that regard as well. I've always considered Far Cry 2 to be a minimalist shooter, which might sound bizarre when you consider the massive, open world and whatnot. But at its core, there are only a few core elements driving the gameplay here. No shoehorned RPG elements, no crafting, very little NPC interaction, no player-influenced dialogue, not even much of a story. This minimalist, almost barebones approach to gameplay? Well, quite frankly, it's just plain fantastic. One thing I really disliked about Far Cry 3 was the degree of artificial progression in it. By which I mean the skill trees and crafting- this doesn't add flavor to the game as everyone ends up getting everything by the end and it just limits early-game creativity. One term that frequently comes to mind when I think about Far Cry 2 is ""emergent gameplay;"" that is, progression that is directed by the player instead of the game. There are unlocks and upgrades, yeah, and there is a reason to get them, but the most prominent progression in the game is that of your own playstyle. You start to learn what weapons, what routes, what tactics work the best for you and work from there- instead of being given a list of skills for your character. I'm a huge fan of the concept of character proficiency, but it just doesn't belong in a game like this, and the fact that Far Cry 2 is so aware of that is really refreshing. You never feel truly forced into a gameplay style or scenario you genuinely dislike, a problem many open-world games suffer from.The AI in Far Cry 2 is absolutely insane, to say the least. It's way too smart for its own good much of the time, and while this might seem cheap at times, it's also an excellent catalyst for the aforementioned emergent gameplay and player-directed progression. I remember starting out my initial play through trying to get up close and personal and stealthy, but the AI just isn't stupid enough for that to work. So I shifted to a more distant playstyle- sniping, picking off enemies, constantly on the move- interspersed with aggressive, ballsy assaults when the situation called for it or my position was compromised. Part of the gameplay is learning the AI's tricks and figuring out what works best for you. The AI is advanced enough that there are no glaring exploits to make the game too easy, but at the same time, if you're expecting a stealth shooter you're going to be disappointed. It really contributes to a feeling of overall cerebrality- you can be great at shooters but if you don't plan your moves you won't get far. It's worth mentioning by now that I've been playing with a realism mod on Infamous difficulty, which really is the only way to play as far as I'm concerned. The enemies are a little too spongy in vanilla, but the setup I use can be brutally difficult yet is rarely ever unfair. The gameplay requires analysis and personal experience and I can admit I was frustrated early game that nothing I did seemed to work- probably one of the biggest reasons this game isn't better remembered- but when you get it down the core gameplay is both elegantly simple and constantly engaging, while always feeling personally rewarding.Moving onto some of the weaker points, the sound design is a mixed bag, with guns sounding stock and animations not always syncing properly with sounds, but the ambient noise, dynamic soundtrack and enemy chatter are all pretty memorable.It was at this point in the review I ran out of mentally pre-rehearsed stuff to say. I'm not good at properly reviewing stuff. But yeah this game's rad so play it if it sounds like something you'd play.			"

												Boring. The game can be pretty and interesting for short periods, but then you get a mission that requires you to cross the map, and there goes thirty minutes of battling through the same checkpoints that you cleared for the last mission, battle into the facility that you've cleared three or four times before, attempt to save a buddy who insists on fighting while surrounded and at close range. I love the open map, but what makes a game is fun, interest, and storyline. This game features none of those.			"

												Pros:+ Amazing scenery + Smooth gameplay+ Jammed mechanic are kinda neat I thinkCons:- Repetitive. - Malaria attack. This sh*t always happen when I was on the middle warfare.- Iritating enemy.    1. every a couple seconds on the road, there is jeep from nowhere shooting you.   2. there is no point to clear the guard post, they just respawn a couple seconds after you leave the post.   3. so, It took long time to complete every mission because of those. I have to go offroad which means more further   than on the road.This game suit for gamers who love the challenge.6/10 "

												Can you say 'underrated?'Yea, you'd better believe it, Far Cry 2 is the best title in the series, for me. Perfect? No, but neither is the rest of the series. Totally satisfying? No, but neither is the rest of the series. Dropping with atmosphere like the knifed fresh corpse of a wilderbeast drips that essential red elixir? You must believe it. And this is a quality that evades the rest of the series entirely.You are [I can't remember I've played too many similar games], a face into which a video game camera has been thrust, itself belonging to a body which has been thrust right into the meatgrinder of a central african (I wanna say 'kinda Kenya but more sandy' though this may be entirely incorrect) civil war, complete with savage flora, savage fauna and savage hearts. You begin the game staring wonderously at the bump map'd face of a taxi driver as he drives you deeper and deeper into a threatening looking square of hell - dissapointingly scaled to accomodate the xbox 360 I believe, but certainly impactful - where he drops at a hotel. You get out, get to your room, get to bed and wake up with infected with Malaria and dodging bullets as fighting has broken out in the town.You escape. You have no idea where you are. The landscape is alien and scary, the locals seem more like human big cats with AKs and a thirst for blood than video game villains, the roars of labouring car engines spark off immediate ""GTFO of here!"" sprints for cover, trees flex in the breeze, bushes rustle, a hot sun beats down on you like a express post migraine, and you eventually make it to a safe house where a bunch of uncaring locals welcome you to their collective deathwarrant and start giving you orders. You net some pills for the Malaria - things which will always stick with you and occasionally give you cause to run errands for the missionaries who supply them - and a rusty assault rifle and you're loose - free to do what you will, if you dare.The quality of this game is in the oppressive environment which has been really wonderfull captured. Occasional townships light up real nice in dusty battles, blood diamonds litter the map in padded suitcases, militia held checkpoints stare down at you from every hilltop or intersection.Difficult, yes. Challenging, yes. But inaccesible? No. The completionist in me loved this game - finding diamonds is just so easy, though finding them all would be a very lengthy mission indeed. Discovering every portion of the map, likewise a treat in itself. Ticking off enemy base camps and noting down the location of weapons stashes for future reference, all of these tasks are seamless and require one to go out of one's way only very rarely. The sandbox gameplay is so dense and rewarding infact that the campaign is almost a saddle on it - a key final mission of the opening zone became markedly less imposing for me when I realized that it was set in a clifftop fortress which I had comprehensively massacred on my first day in country.Complete that story, those missions, though, because they will eventually open up new areas for you to explore, new people for you to meet (interactable characters are rare but convincing) and new atmosphere to soak up.This game is a simulator, a simulator of that gritty, horrifying mode of hot Central African civil war that movies like Blood Diamond and co just about hinted at. It is not the best game ever made, and it is no the best game available on these pages, but it is a good one, and I would recommend it ahead of the next two games in the series. Or the third one at least, which completely failed to live up to the achievements of this title.			"

												This is an awful game in almost every aspect... So let's try and summarise it...- Since you are in Africa, and as we all know it, when you are in Africa, everything must be filtered through some awful brownish/yellowish colour to remind you... That you are in Africa... Or Mexico, or wherever... It is not pleasant for eyes...- Enemy AI goes from completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mushroom IQ to ultra intelligent super computer/robot from far future with integrated infra red/night vision/cat's ears...- About 50% of time fighting, you will turn around like an idiot, trying to pinpoint exact location of enemy who is shooting...- Once you shoot at them, they are able to see you even if you are laying silently in 1 meter high grass...- And, if that was not enough, once you clear out an enemy camp, return 10 minutes later, everyone are alive and kicking! ♥♥♥♥ yeah! :)- Missions... Oh, side missions... Every mission is the same... They tell you some completely irrelevant back story, and tell you to kill/destroy someone... You go to the mission location, there are 2-3 cars and usually a truck going in circles (!?)... Destroy the truck, and TA-DA, diamonds are automatically in your pocket!- Talking about cars... There are, I don't know, maybe 4 different vehicles in game... I cannot find any difference between them when driving...- And talking about driving... Wow, since most of the map is awful brownish terrain, you won't feel like exploring... There is nothing to explore, world is ugly (except for few exceptions), you will end up driving from one part of the map to the other all the time... Especially since missions are almost always as far from as they can be, from the point you took them... There are some bus stations, but they are so rare, it's easier to just drive...- Also, player character has a malaria... So, from time to time, you'll need to take pills, or survive through vertigo effects... It might be important for story, but I still have a feeling that it is too burdensome for gameplay...- As, it is usually a problem with games, main character is a mute retard...And now for Pros;- It has a QUIT button. I really tried to like this game, but...Yeah, it's actually one of the games I cannot find any good thing about; it's boring, repetitive and full of little problems and bugs... It's obnoxious...TL;DR: Don't.... just... Don't...			"

												1-3/2016 Original Review:Picture Dead Island.  Now, take away all the zombies, skill trees, interesting characters, and set the game in Africa.  Hey look, you've got Far Cry 2, a game with a meaningless protagonist who loves doing people's chores!  I get why people could enjoy this game, but I really didn't.  I have yet to finish the game and I'm dreading having to press on.  Here's some pros and cons to help you understand why:Pros:-Absolutely beautiful atmosphere/map.  Looking out over a desert, lake, or bayou at sunset is amazing.-This game's multiplayer was my childhood, and the custom maps feature is awesome.  Playing escape maps with friends online holds some great memories for me.  Unfortunately, online play for this game is near dead now, but if you can get a chance to play some custom maps with friends they're fun.Cons:  Oh god, where do I start.  -Gameplay wise, get ready for some repetition.  Talk to an NPC, get a quest, drive to the other side of the damn map (or use the poorly implemented quick travel system), shoot people or blow something up, rinse & repeat.  It feels like a sin for a game with such a vast environment to feel so slow, dry, and outright boring.-This game is literally driving Simulator 2009 edition.  You have to drive so much, only to be interrupted halfway to your destination which feels 35253 miles away by some random mercenary who thought it'd be tactical to literally ram the hell into you.  This occurs WAY too often and gets extremely annoying.  -The game is divided into two acts.  The problem with this, is by the end of act one the game feels like it's ready to end.  But it doesn't.  It goes into act two.  This literally made my jaw drop.  I was so ready to be done with this driving simulator.-If you're looking for a good story, don't come here.  In the beginning of the game, your character gets an idea in their mind of what they want to do.  Without spoiling anything, I'll say that at literally EVERY opportunity they get to carry out their objective, they're hindered physically (in pain, can't move, etc etc).  Total bs.  If this was the main goal of the game, I'd go to think they'd lift a finger a little more.  I think at the point in the game I'm currently at I can see why the protagonist might be changing their mind about killing the Jackal, but since our character doesn't talk we have no way of knowing their intentions.  Overall if you're a fan of the Far Cry series give this a whirl.  Otherwise stay away, stay far away.  5/101-7/2016 UPDATE:I've been trying to finish this game, and oh has it been hard.  Not gameplay difficulty wise, but hard as in difficult to sit through this p.o.s...This game is a perfect example of where a company threw the golden rule of games out the window: Gameplay over Graphics.  This game is gorgeous, but the gameplay is dry and repetative, not fun at all no matter how many different ways there are to approach missions.  This is because they're all the same exact thing, as I discussed in my older review above.  This game crashes constantly for me.  I was able to deal with this, up until now.  I have a few different save files that I've been making throughout the game just as a safety, and boy I'm glad I did.  I was at 88% game completion on my primary save, and I thought, I haven't saved in a while, I better save before end game!  Guess what?  I went to save, the game crashed, my heart sank.  ""No,"" I thought to myself , ""please don't let my save be corrupted.""  Sure enough, it was.  Back to 73% game completion for me.  I get to do all those repetitious missions over again.  Woo-hoo.  I may add more comments when I do manage to finish this glitchy pile of crap.  But, until then, this is me signing out, advising you to not waste your time on this installment of the Far Cry franchise.1-7/2016 UPDATE 2 (Several hours later):Well, I did it.  I managed to finish the game.  I managed to combat losing my save progress by creating multiple new save files instead of overwriting the same one.  The ending of the game is o.k, but certainly not very good.  Before the ending, the game tries to make you feel as though your choices throughout the second half of the game meant something, but really it just decides slight aesthetic differences (who's present at the end, etc).  I'm in a love/hate relationship with the fact that  all of your friends that you helped throughout the game turn on you and betray you, and you have to in turn murder all of them.   It's a twist that attempts to show the true nature of the world you're in, but also makes little sense after all you've been through.Even the final choice in the game makes no difference whatsoever.  Choice is a complete illusion in this game, which is lame.  I went back to my save just before the final choice and tried the other option, the game ends exactly the same no matter which errand you decide to run.Overall, having finished the game, my opinion isn't very changed.  The ending doesn't redeem the poor gunplay.  It doesn't redeem the annoying as hell A.I. who shoot me on sight without good reason, and who ram my car with their every 5 minutes which made driving so unenjoyable.  The voice acting is shoddy and there's only one or two people who seem to have actually tried to sound convincing.  Neither of this people are the main antagonist, either.It's just not a very good game.Remember Devs, Gameplay over Graphics.Revised score: 3/10P.S:  I hit uninstall on the game and the game opened.  What?			"

												Far Cry 2 is a solid game, with great graphics, a cool story, a realistic, open setting and... a lot of respawning enemies. It's pretty much the only downside to this game. The fact that you have to inject yourself, fix your car, that rockets fall down only a few metres away from you on occasion and that fire spreads across the land is all very unique and adds to the atmosphere. But like I said, the enemies keep respawning. And I'm not talking about the 'you close your game and the next you start it the enemies have respawned' kind of respawning. No, more like 'enemies respawn within 30 minutes or so' respawning. It gets very frustrating because at times you get the feeling that you have no influence on the gameworld, that you're doing practically everything for nothing. If you can just ignore that then there's a great game waiting for you here.[Rating: 86/100]			"
