												What is Grand Theft Auto 2?Honestly, if you don't know what GTA 2 is, stop reading this review, download it (it is freeware) and play it! See the end of this review for links that may or may not work, and make sure to check for viruses, for example on VirusTotal!But okay, what is Grand Theft Auto 2?Grand Theft Auto 2, or GTA2 for short, is a top-down action game where you can steal vehicles, shoot at people and fulfill missions for various gangs in the city which unlock by having respect for them (it is recommended to do all missions for one faction at once since you should have the respect by the time you complete their missions). You gain respect by fulfilling missions and shooting enemy gangs. There are three gangs in each district (level), each with distinctive personality. As an example, there is an over-the-top asian gang, the mafia-like Zaibatsu, the Hippie gang ""Loonies"", and so on.The game is entirely controlled by the keyboard. It feels fluid, the graphics which at the time were too demanding for my PC (in 1998 the game would run but the graphic effects would leave white boxes because I had no 3D card) nowadays are good 2D from above. There is one known crash which was never fixed but can be easily avoided: Entering a vehicle while shooting the flamethrower crashes the game - no other gun crashes it.The game can be saved at anytime outside missions in a central spot, of which there is one on each map (this costs 50,000 USD ingame, so you want to keep your multiplier from missions and reload if you die or get caught by the cops - this also means you need to do the first two or three missions in one run to get the score). There are additional collectibles - 50 GTA plates and 20 Kill Frenzies. Warning! If you play the game in German, they might be censored, I am not sure about that anymore (I only remember they were in the German version, but I don't know if all were there).I had great fun just bringing vehicles to the crane to see what goodies each one gives, then running rampage against the cops or against the civilians until I face my inevitable death or in very rare occasions even survive. At one time I even completed the first level with 100 percent. And although the game has only three levels, they can take a lot of time, although a speedrun probably could do them in maybe an hour each (of course only the missions then).And I did not even talk about the hidden things you can discover such as combos, ""Elvis has left the building"", the great soundtrack, the fun you can have with grenades and rocket launchers, the ability to even drive a TANK, etc.So is the game worth it? Of course! I have almost 7 hours in the Steam version as I write this, and that is years after I really played it. If you never played this game, give it a try, you will not be disappointed! The download link can be found above, as sadly neither the Rockstar Classics nor the Steam version are available anymore.Recommended: Yes!Download for the non-Steam version (freeware): (EDIT: But run it in a sandbox, see below!)http ://www. chip. de/ downloads/Grand-Theft-Auto-GTA-2_13015291.htmlClick on the blue button that says ""Download"", then again, then again and the download of a ZIP file will start.EDIT: Because VirusTotal tests the exe with a 22 of 56 detection rate (vs. 0 of 56 for the Steam version), the link has been made unworkable. Copy the line and remove the empty spaces to use the chip.de download. Usually the site is clean, but better safe than sorry! Many thanks to HughMungusBone2020 and SneakyGunz for testing (see comments)!EDIT 2: I found another download: https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA/comments/41dved/gta_2_download/Also, in the comments section this website was recommended (thanks at Phlum): http://gtamp.com/gta2/ All downloads are AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION! Make sure to check for viruses, I am not liable for any issues.			"

Short version: 78%Even though GTA2 is sort of the black sheep of the franchise, it is easy to fall in love with its easier overhead driver/shooter mechanics and zanier atmosphere that manages to hide the issue of repetitive missions and tiresome platforming sections.Long version:Grand Theft Auto 2, while it retains many gameplay elements of GTA1, is still the odd one out when it comes to the franchise. For starters, it is the only game that isn’t tied to a real-world city or time frame: Anywhere City is a featureless metropolis, and the supposedly 2013 date doesn’t fit the 1950s car designs.Just like in GTA1, the goal of the game is to earn enough money to advance to the next level, usually accomplished by accepting jobs from three rivalling gangs to raise the score multiplier. These jobs also earn respect, a new mechanic that forces the player into some love/hate micromanagement to access high-tier missions at the cost of making entire neighbourhoods hostile. The missions themselves are quite varied in flavour text but not in objectives: you either chase down a target or try to get a specific vehicle to a specific spot. There is some emphasis on platforming, especially in the last district, but these sections are probably the worst in the entire game.Gameplay also had some tweaks, and the result is a double-edged sword. Everything is easier now with the introduction of a player health bar and by increasing the sturdiness of every vehicle. And everything also feels more dragged out with a camera that essentially prevents going fast or missions where you are expected to take on entire armies on your own. The save feature and the ability to retry failed missions helps a lot, but in the end, GTA2 just feels more tiresome (yet more thought-out) than its predecessor did.			"

												This game is simply the one that got me in Grand Theft Auto. And it's still one of my favorites. The fact that you have three full maps to explore. Plus nine different factions (three for each map) to work for. And to get the full expierence you get to have as much fun and killing as you want. Is it as modern as recent games? No, you have to handle the top down-perspective and the fact that it might not be the entire idea you get from the games after GTA III. But it's still is one and will ever be one of my favorites.

												The rampages, gang missions and the ""karma"" style gang relations with the tripartite of gangs is quite interesting. One minute you'll be working with the Yakuza, the next you'll be killing them. There's no real story - it's just an arcade free-raoming rampage mayhem. It's not too easy so it isn't boring. The game is pretty long given its arcadish feel, and the only way to finish it (aside from doing all the missions) is to gain maximum amount of money to unlock bonus levels. That will take many hours. The intro kinda sums up the game really... or at least the context anyway. Definitely worth checking out if you're bored. And remember, respect is everything.			"

												Great classic arcade game where you try and rack up as much points as possible while doing odd jobs for gangs and causing as much mayhem as possible. I prefer this over gta 3 which says quite a bit,  years after(we're talking over a decade) I still played this on my ps2/ps3. for PC you have vike's gta 2 patch which optimizes and fixes the game up even more, I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes arcade shoot-em-up exploration type games.

												The first GTA game with the so loved GTA feeling. The whole game is played from a top-down perspective with 3D objects.You can do missions for rivaling gangs (Zaibatsu, Loonies, Yakutza,...). An important part is dealing with the respect level of these organisations. You can only do missions for gangs with positiv respect level.But technically you can finish the game without doing missions, because you get points for everything you do in a way.Additionally you have to juggle your saves. You need to pay 50.000 $ per save (especially at the beginning this is the money of 2-3 missions).Wonderful game with outdated graphics, but starting point of one of the best franchises.btw, my playtime of GTA2 is after GTA:SA the highest.

Multiplayer was good too if you could get TCP/IP mode to work (including deathmatch and other modes, even including cops which is great fun!), and the missions were much more impressive then the originals.

												A complete improvement from its predecesor.You must burp and fart your way through Anywhere City doing missions for 3 gangs per district. But every time you do this another gang will be angry at you and attack you on sight until you ""balance"" the situation.Once you get enough money you can progress to the next district... OR you can do all the missions, fight the leaders of the 3 gangs and see how everything goes to♥♥♥♥♥♥at the end before you leave.Look out for Elvis.			"

You weren’t satisfied with just running over ♥♥♥♥♥es, hoes, and pedestrians in the prequel? You now can electrocute them with your electro gun. The radio is chock full of satire and hilarity. There are even more varied ways to earn cash and respect in the game. To top it all off, the graphics for Grand Theft Auto 2 is a massive upgrade from its predecessor. Everything is much more detailed which in turn makes the explosions and gores that much more satisfying. If you’re going to play a classic Grand Theft Auto game, might as well start at number 2 and skip the first one entirely.			"

												Grand Theft Auto 2 (GTA 2) — компьютерная игра в жанре Action, продолжение Grand Theft Auto, разработанная компанией DMA Design (ныне Rockstar North).С 22 декабря 2004 года современную PC-версию игры GTA 2, содержащую мультиплеер, можно бесплатно загрузить на официальном сайте Rockstar Games. Игра доступна по Steam с 4 января 2008 года. В России игра была локализована и издана компанией «Бука» под названием «GTA 2: Беспредел».Вводное видео к игре является нарезкой из восьмиминутного короткометражного фильма, снятого в 1999 году для повышения популярности игры. Данный фильм доступен для свободного скачивания с сайта Rockstar Games. Начав еще в GTA: London 1969 движение в верную сторону, ко второй части серия вплотную приблизилась к схеме, которая для GTA сейчас считается классической. Немного подтянув графику, игре оставили аутентичный top-down-ракурс, повысили сложность ролевых отношений с органами правопорядка и мафиозными группировками и, конечно же, сделали еще больше города, при этом так и не снабдив нас картой местности. Значительных изменений в геймплее так и не последовало, зато появилось сумасшедшее стилевое наполнение, подразумевавшее полное отсутствие таких часто встречающихся в играх вещей, как ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ьная музыка и не менее ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ьный арт. Заручившись поддержкой легендарного английского лейбла Moving Shadow, DMA получили в пользование дюжину достойнейших треков в диапазоне от фанка до драм-н-бейса. В рамках рекламной кампании была снята семиминутная экранизация игрового процесса GTA в стиле Гая Ричи («Большой куш», «Рокнролльщик»), с угоном грузовика группировки Zaibatsu, драгдилерством и спасением толпы кришнаитов.Ставка Rockstar на атмосферу показалась странной тогда, в 1999-м, хотя, по сути, ничего дурного в этом не было: игру банально подкрасили и переодели, но сделали это достойно.
