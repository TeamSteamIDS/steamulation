												Even if Spore wasn't as it was expected to be like at launch, it is still a great game to play.Games like Spore don't come around often. I have never seen another game with so much freedom on what you can do inside of it. In the Cell Stage, you get to choose whether you are an omnivore, a carnivore or a herbivore. It's an extremely specific detail and it's why this game is so well made. There are many small choices like this in the game, you can become a warrior and kill everyone or trade your way up the ranks or just be a friendly race.The Cell Stage is the first stage that you play in the game, where you must start as a small cell and work your way up to becoming a creature with legs and arms that can walk around on land. The first cruical choice in this game is deciding whether you are a carnivore, an omnivore or a herbivore. This decision can effect your abilities in the creature stage. After you have chosen, you must either eat red meat (carnivore) or green plants (herbivore) or both if you are an omnivore. The general basis of this stage is to just eat as much as you can, and eventually you will become bigger and bigger, and it roughly takes about 10 minutes to finish this stage.The second stage in the game, The Creature Stage is one of the longest stages in the game. After finishing the cell stage, you must ally or kill other creatures until your brain becomes smart enough to create fire. This stage may take a while, and it all depends on how quickly you adapt to your surroundings and when you get certain unlocks. Overall this stage is very fun and can vary depending on what choices you make. The Tribal Stage is the third stage in this game, and starts after you get a cutscene of your creatures learning to make fire. This stage requires you to build huts for playing music to other tribes (allying them) or building huts to equip your tribe members with weapons to destory your opposing tribes with. This stage is definitely the most stressful stage of them all, as some of the timing with the instruments are off and can purely be based on luck in some cases. Fighting with other tribes is more fun and feels more rewarding.The second-to-last stage in this game is the Civillization Stage. In this stage, you are either preset to Religious, Economic or Millitary, depending on your previous actions in the Tribal and Creature stage. (You can manually set these if you decide to start a game at this stage.) Religious and Millitary cities have the same sort of way to gaining control of other cities, which is by attacking them. This is normally the quickest way to do the stage but can take some time if you do not decide to use the weapons provided at the near-end game on the toolbar. Economic cities, however, can propose to other cities to trade with them, which can generate you and the city you are trading with Sporebucks, and can be beneficial in the future. You gain control of the cities by buying them. The last stage in the game and the most fun and definitely the most time consuming. This stage starts after you conquer all the cities in the Civilization Stage. The stage starts out by having you learn the basic controls for your spaceship, scanning a crashed spaceship and a destroyed civilization. The end goal of this stage is just to get to the middle of the galaxy. However, you can do many other things in this stage, such as painting planets, searching for artifacts and trading with other empires.There is not really a story or plot to this game, as the story is mainly up to you and what you want to do. There is only a small plot point and it only features at the end of the game, once you go into the center of the galaxy. The creation menu in this game is very unique, there are many parts that you can use to create your own buildings, spaceships, creatures and vehicles. You can even paint different colours onto your creations and make them stand out however you want, whether it is with big or small horns, or with a big mouth and small eyes, the possibilities that this game shows is endless and very enjoyable to use.An add-on to the original game is called [Spore] Galactic Adventures, which expands your journey as an empire and lets you go down onto planets and do missions like hunting for artifacts or helping in a fight. You captain your own ship, like you do in the original game, but you can also have three crew members, just like in the creature stage, that can accompany you in your missions. The DLC also goes more indepth on what class / traits you can have, and can manually choose if you want to be a Trader, a Zealot or a Ecnomist, through the points that you earn by doing missions, you can select tools that can help you in that specific section, such as deadly weapons for the warrior and better energy storage for the scientist. Galactic Adventures is a great example of what a DLC should be. It's fun, increases the gameplay and gives you more freedom in your world.TL:DR This game is absolutely worth getting. It is so good and well-created in lots of places and gives you enough choices and decisions in the game to make it feel like it matters. The best thing about this game is definitely the space stage and the Galactic Adventures addon because it gives a fresh feel to the game and gives it a better sense of realism.			"

												This is one the best game I have ever played.This game is so perfect, or almost.First of all, this is a simulator of life evolution, with Cellular, Creature, Tribal, Civilization and Space stage. All of those are epic. The cellular one is pretty cool as introduction of the game, but a little too short, the creature stage is very nice, I love it, this is RPG, then comes Tribal and Civilizations stages which are strategical gamemodes, they are pretty cool too, and the comes the ♥♥♥♥ing best part of the game, the space stage, you are free to evolve your empire in an ENTIERE galaxy which contains more than 500 000 stars, and those stars contains between 1 and 8 planets (rocky and gas and satellites). The variety is so complex. You can encounter so many alien empires, you create your own creature along your history from Cell to Space captain. you create your own vehicules, buildings, villagers and spaceships, this is awesome.There are some negative points though, the server are closed, EA abandonned this wonderful game, this is so sad.Also, there are caracteristics for vehicules in Civilisation stage : speed, attack and health, that is not as customisable as in cilisation stage for the Space stage, too bad, I would have loved to see those in the space stage, but overall this is an amazing game with the biggest map ever and a very very very long gameplay.I have played it more than 300 hours as a non-steam game ! Play it ! it worths !!! I recommand particullary the Space stage if you like space and other stages if you like simulation, rpg and/or strategy. The editor is very complete, you can customise what you want with lots of templates for vehicules, buildings and creatures. There are lots of mods downloadables on the internet. Very long gameplay and amazing freedom Playable adventures on different types of planets and different kind of adventures (discretion, attack, defense, quest etc...) Finally, I give the note of 9/10 to this game. "

												Spore Galactic Adventures is a add-on to Spore it focuses on the space stage when you get to it you name your captain and it lets you go down from your ship and have well... adventures! A key part and my favorite is the new weapons! You can get claws, lazers all that kind of stuff. I think people should own this add-on the Spore!			"

												Okay...let's get the bad and the ugly out of the way first.Support for this game has been dropped entirely as of a few years ago. There's a few bugs that won't ever be fixed. As far as I know, the community is mostly dead. It's a pain in the rear to get started sometimes, and that seems to depend entirely on the alignment of the planets in relation to Will Wright's left buttock.That said, when this truly wonderful game decides to work, it's really. freaking. fun.You can make your own bizzare alien creatures, put stupid hats on them, build them spaceships to whiz around in, and blow stuff up. Including Earth.You can make friends with, or eat, pretty damn near any creature you encounter in the first two-fifths of the game, and then start forming a society. Which can also be founded on either making friends, slaughtering enemies, or both. You then go on to play a simplified version of Sid Meier's Civilization, in which you get to make your own units, control the spice (AND THE UNIVERSE...no, that's later), and take over the world. After which, you can conquer the galaxy however you wish. Do you want to make friends with whatever alien races you encounter? Go right ahead! Is blowing them up and taking their stuff more your style? You can do that, too! Would you prefer to subvert your enemies through the power of capitalism, and buy their homeworlds RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER THEM? HECK YEAH!Also there's some minor stuff about reaching the galactic core or whatever, but that doesn't matter much.You can also visit alien worlds and go on exciting adventures created by other players.Or you could spend endless hours creating things yourself.Anyway, THIS GAME IS AMAZING YOU NEED IT			"

												Well, plenty have done reviews over the basics of the previous Spore games, so why don't I review the extension: Galatic Adventures.This is played in conjunction with Spore's Space Stage as ""Missions"". Galactic Adventures actually starts you off with a few easy Maxis-made Adventures, where you get the hang of how each adventure plays out. These can range from action-themed adventures, puzzle-solving adventures, story/quest adventures, and so on. Galactic Adventures even has an Adventure Creator, where you can make your OWN Adventures for you to play AND to share with players, worldwide, on the Sporepedia. This also adds a new list of unique buildings, vehicles, and creatures to work with (all tagged with ""gaprop""), and you can create your own, too, and tag them with ""gaprop"" so you don't happen to get these individual creations in your Space Stage gameplay (or you don't have to). Also, along with the adventures, each game file creates its own Captain (your creature in the Space Stage), which you can name and outfit with Captain Parts (weapons, sheilds, life/energy storage, social parts, etc), to further make each exploration (and adventure) unique.At this point, you may spend a lot of time either downloading new adventures, or making your own; and at that point, the only real limit is your imagination.Live long and prosper! Nanoo Nanoo!Update: For those wondering what have I done for 2K + hours in Spore: Making playable adventures, and alpha and beta-testing them.			"

												While it was dumbed down by EA, this is still an amazing, and occasionally touching game. I mean, how can you not laugh when a species you've raised to the space stage wipes out all life on a planet just because they look wierd or ugly or they rubbed you in slightly a wrong way?! :D Secondly, I highly reccomend the galactic adventures DLC, as without it, the space stage can get boring. Plus the adventures by the highly acclaimed user Parkaboy are quite the works of art.			"

												Most people dislike spore for one reason or another, not me.I think most critics just think that the game gets boring after a while, and while I agree, I have to say ""Did you expect your interest to last the entirety of the Milky Way Galaxy?"" For what it is, it's FINE. Just fine. It's not some fantastic mashup of open world exploration with Civilization and Stellaris, okay? It's a Maxis game from like 2008, you gotta lower your expectations people!Again, good game, I enjoy it, and I find myself coming back to it now and then and still having fun.			"

												Although just a DLC for Spore it is wonderful.You can play as your captain in the Space Stage, get gear (which makes your captain A LOT better) and play adventures.That is all you can do with your own singleplayer worlds. But you might be wondering ""But can I make my own adventures?"" Yes! You can! You can add creatures, scuplt the world, add foliage, add vehichles and last but not least you can add buildings.That is all that I can name on the top of my head. So yeah.			"

												This is great and fun game, you go from a small cell to a Space captain. You can even create your own galactic adventures and you can make creatures that show up as you play. Once you are finished with the creature stage it begins to become an RTS that is very well made. The Tribal stage is fun and you can either burn enemy tribes or become their friends. The civilization stage can be very fun but it is a bit short But you can buy other cities and nations or go to war and conquer the enemy cities or convert them using religous power. And then Space Stage where you have a entire galaxy to buy peoples stars and colonise planets and With this add-on you can do galactic adventures and make them. I would definitley reccamend this to friends and it makes a great gift. I hope this review was helpful.			"

												(I had to post this review on the Galactic Adventures page because I play it with this pack, but this review talks about the core game.)I have had this game since 2008 as a retail copy, so I have put more hours into it then it shows on here. I love this game, despite it's flaws, it's quirky, it's unique and it let's me get creative! I understand that this game was overhyped as hell back in the early 2000s, but playing it for what it is, it's still a fun game. In fact, it's not really bad, just was disappointing to many. So now I will quickly go over the game and it's features it has to offer.GameplayCell stageIt's a nice tutorial for the game that helps you understand what Spore is all about, which is surviving in a harsh environment and helping your creature evolve. The only thing that bothers me about this stage of the game, is that there is no procedural user generated content to find...it's just Maxis's creations.Creature stageOne of my favorite stages, your cell now has evolved onto land and now has to make a choice...dance or kill. You're now surviving in a much larger world from cell stage, you must either make allies or enemies with your new neighbors. Doing this will provide you DNA points (which is used as currency in the creature creator) and body parts. Gaining new parts and DNA will help you change your generation and give you social and combat skills in order to defend or befriend other more advanced creatures as you get farther into the stage.Tribal stageMy other favorite stage, this one is more of a simplified RTS style stage. Your species is now sentient and has formed a tribe. You now control a group of your species instead of just one. Once again, you must decide on whether to make friends or enemies with other tribes. You collect resources (which is food) and use it as currency to build tools for your tribe, to give as a gift to hostile tribes which you can become friends with then or give to wild animals and make them your pets, the pets can help defend you and they give you eggs which is also used as a resource. One thing I will criticize about this stage is that it's a little too similar to creature stage and the npc tribes don't interact with each other.Civilization stageThis is where your species becomes the dominate species on your planet, they now build cities and vehicles which you can create! Depending how you played the previous stage will determine what kind of city and vehicle you'll get. There is religious, economic and military. They work similar but with a different goal in mind, as a military you'll conquer other cities, as a religious you'll convert cities and as an economic you'll buy cities. You'll be able to use land, sea and air vehicles which will determine the best way to dominate other cities. Some cities can only be reached by sea or air vehicles.Space stageI haven't fully explored space stage but here's what I know of it, Space stage is the meat of the game, it's a combination of all of the other stages, you'll be able to create your first spaceship and explore a galaxy of millions and I mean,literally millions of stars. Think of it as a scaled down No Man's Sky. Your able to travel to other solar systems, trade with other races, start wars with them or form an alliance with them. Take on missions (this is expanded on with Galactic Adventures expansion pack), colonize planets, find rare collectibles, abduct creatures and manipulate other planets by terraforming them or destroy them. The main goal of the space stage is to get to the center of the galaxy. However, the game will not stop there, once you reach the main goal, you are still able to freely explore the Galaxy to you hearts content. There is a lot to do that you could spend hours on this stage.EditorsThere are a few editors throughout the main game that allows you to create any kind of creature, vehicle, building and spaceship. They are quite possibly the best thing this game has to offer! They are incredibly robust and flexible and most importantly...easy to use! You can create a six legged horse with dragon wings! Or a large tank with twenty guns and wheels!  Or your favorite character as a spaceship! The possibilities are endless! I have spent so many hours creating all sorts of abstract things.Procedural user generated contentAnother cool feature of this game is that all of the npcs such as creatures, vehicles, buildings and spaceships are all made by other players. You will be able to see your friends creations in your game! There is a handy content browser called Sporepedia, that lets you share, browse and download other creations right into your game.So yes, despite the negative reception the game got years ago, I think it's a fun game. I only wish that Maxis would update the game again, I want to be able to make plants, to give more variety to the planets.			"

												Spore. There are so many feelings related to this word. Galactic adventrures. These two words have been literally taking whole days of my life since I was only 10 y.o. I remember how I was making huge Adventures, building insane empires and just taking all the Milky Way over. Spore is a kind of a game which you always find something new in. You never get tired of it, cause every day playing it you keep saying ""Woow, how didn't I know that!?"" over and over again. Also, because of Shooters and this stuff I have become very nervous through the time, but I have NEVER raged because of Spore. It's so magnificent that you just don't have time for butthurting! Highly recommended for relaxing.About the game itself. Some people might find first stages uninteresting, for sure, ""They are boring"" - they say. But believe or not, every stage should be counted as a different game, and all 5 games are connected. Look: Cell stage - sth Agar.io(ish), Creature stage - Classic open-world RPG, Tribe and Civilization stages - Tactical Strategy, Space stage - doesn't even need to be said. ""Okey, this game looks like a mix of others, so what?"". Noo, you are completely mistaken, Spore just contains everything, Maxis have put so so much stuff into a 5 GB  game, so anyone could find something interesting for them. ""Deym, what if I don't wanna make a ♥♥♥♥♥ in Creature stage like everybody does, what do I do then?"". Here we meet the Redactor. Tons and tons of parts you can aquire, resize, move, replace, spin, color - do anything with anything! The only thing that may stop you is your own imagination. The farther you get - the more creativity you can show! Creatures, buildings, boats, cars, planes, even spaceships - create your own with these *pulls off a bag of parts*.""Oh, I am gonna get tired of all this very soon, what will make me play this years and years?"". The game is full of hidden(and not so) jokes. Spore makes fun out of every problem of nowadays. Religion, wars, racism, sexism(no women at all) etc. Spore touched each feeling and showed it without hurting. Ye, of course, it was made for 12+ kids but who ever gave it a spark? Kids play it because it's interesting to create stuff and explore the galaxy, teens play it because they are looking for their place in this world and Spore really helps with that, really. Adults, though, are the grown up kids, kek.Galactic Adventures DLC(can I call it DLC?) is like another game in addition to what I've said upper but squared. Here you get even more space to make ANY-DAМN-THING! Just take planet(one of 52 different types), and change it the way you want, you can even decide, where each tree will be! Create seas, rivers, volcanos and stuff like that - all you need is there. On the other hand, you have all redactors in front of you - come and take! Created a new animal? Put some badаss devices on it - let it shoot rockets or summon bees. Got creatures that you needed? Now you can even adjust their character, moving, damage, health, even the phrases if necessary! Make your own planet with its own storyline, share it with friends, dude it's so undescribeable, that you just need to see it yourself.In conclusion(I have only said about the most massive features, there are a lot more), if you want a game which you will wanna play more and more day after day, Spore is definitely one of them! You just have to have it in your library, I promise, you won't regret this. 11/12 just cuz the game is very old and if there was a rebirth of Spore, I personally would want kids from it :-)Go ahead mate, buy it!

												GET THIS GAME. It's a game. Yeah a game, but just not a regular game. It's a game where you get to choose your own destiny! Cell -> creature -> tribal -> civilization -> SPACE. YEAH SPACE. Build your own spaceship and take over the... MILKYWAY or whatever. Ok, let me get to the pros and consPros:You get to create your own creature!You control  mostly  everything!Almost every stage is fun, but we all have our own opinions.This is an exspansion pack, so you can do more stuff than before. SPORE  is a fun timewaster.Lots of easter eggs to find! SPORE  has mods, lots of 'em, so you can have more content, unlimited complexity, infinite money, and anything you can imagine.Cons: Bad/Muddy graphics. Has lots of glitches. Limited parts, or complexity of your creature. Cliping issues. SPORE  servers are down (or atleast i've been told!). SPORE  is a old game, meaning no updates. SPORE  is nothing like the game shown at google E3 showing. So, yeah. that's the end of my review  WEBSITES LAST WORDS:     Wed February 2, 2011    Network outage resolved.    We experienced a network outage that affected several EA sites this afternoon. The issue should be resolved. Thanks for your patience. spore.com Yeah, spore was never fixed.So, my review states TO BUY THIS GAME, AND ENJOY IT!  "

												I'll review each segment of the game seperately...Base Game: This game takes you with creating your own, unique alien race and having them progress from the cellular level all the way through civilization and finally to space travel, and exploring the cosmos!There is a lovely ""Karma"" system where your actions, whether warlike, peaceful, or inbetween will set the special abilities, and stance of your civilization as it progresses.You'll see many types of games set into the different stages, and the game is overall fun to play.Cell Stage: A top-down cellular fight to the finish. With fun evolution mechanics, moments of truly feeling small, and the race for survival. This is one of the best stages.Creature Stage: You've left the ocean, and are given free reign to explore the planet! This mode is immensely fun as well. You have a small group of your own species and you go from nest to nest making friends, and EATING OTHERS!You'll encounter random epic beasts, sudden space ships and meteor showers!A wonderful stage overall!Tribal Stage: One of my least favorite stages if only for the dullness. While I understand it can be fun to have an RTS ""Go destroy their tribe!"" deal, I find this part bores me, and I just get through really quickly just so I can get to the next stage.Civilization Stage: OHho! Do you love Civilization? Do you love RTS games? Do you enjoy fighting 8 enemies at once all vying for the same planet!? THEN DO I HAVE A STAGE FOR YOU!Mattering on how you've progressed, you're either a warmongering fighter with tanks, planes, and boats of mass destruction, a financial empire that's trying to buy out their enemies, or a religious zealotry trying to convert everyone!This gamemode is amazing fun, and is really a better step-up from the Tribal stage.Also, I love that the final ability for a Warmongering race is a mass of Nuclear Missles being launched at once.Space Stage: You've done it! You have progressed your species far enough that they've banded together to create a spacecraft that will explore the cosmos! This stage is vast, but I will admit that it does die out after a couple days. You go about spreading your species through  colonization pods, buying out other speicies systems, or completley annhilating them to make room for your own. There are some fun secrets here and collectibles, so you should have some time before you realize that the task of colonizing the entire galaxy is insane, and you go play something else.Galactic Adventures: Lets finish out with the final expansion. Galactic Adventures has you take the captain of your Space Stage ship and go on user-created adventures that will level them up. These really help add more content and increase the value and playtime of the game.			"

												 DISCLAIMER: IF YOU WON'T READ THIS, AT LEAST READ THE TL;DR AT THE END, IT'S ONLY A LINE LONG. THANK YOU.SPORE is an impressive game. In this game, you start out as a tiny cell (which really resembles zooplankton), where you eat plants or other cells/floating meat. You can call a mate and get to the cell editor, where you can create ANYTHING you can imagine. You evolve into a creature. This is easily the best stage. You can socialize with other species, or kill their faces. You can meet rogue and Epic creatures, supersized versions of regulars. You can add rogues and regular creatures to a pack, but Epics are off limits. You evolve into a tribe. This stage, and the civ stage are not so good, but still acceptable.The Galactic God of sorts, (you), command the tribe. You can ally or kill off the tribes, as before. Civ stage. You capture ""spice geysers"", which produce ""sporebucks"", or ""spucks"". The sign for spucks are the same as the Simoleons, so Sims players may relate to that.  You can be religious, attacking civs with the Ways of Spode, military, which just nukes, or any other violent way to kill. Kinda in the middle are the ecomonists. They'll buy cities for big spucks, so that's always nice. After taking all 12 cities on the world, you evolve into the Space Stage! From here, you command your own ship, and with the GA expanison, you command your captain too. Beam down onto planets, infiltrate, prevent wars, stop invasions, you do it all! Your main goal is to reach the center of the galaxy, but around you is the imposing Grox Empire. They span 4000 systems, and kill you on sight. You can ally with them, which is dancing with the Devil. Everyone hates the Grox. They'll all declare war if you ally them, unless you have 200+ relationship points, which are bought with gifts, missions, trading, routes, etc.That's all for the main concept. Now, for a little bit on Sporecasts and possibilities. Sporecasts are you, the user, and other's creations. Of course, you can just make critters, but there's millions of awesome creatures made and ready to play! Maxis made their share of critters, just to ensure no one runs out of little dudes. That's all for now. tl;dr: good game, good content, best bought when on a discount. do get the main SPORE game first, as galactic adventures is not usable without it.			"

												There are few games that can keep me coming back for more time and time again. Those games are Skyrim, Team Fortress 2, and Spore.That being said, SPORE is an TOTALLY different kind of game than Skyrim and TF2. However it's just as good of a game for different reason. The beauty of the generated worlds and wildlife, even on a low-spec computer, is fairly impressive for a game this old. But what enthralls me the most is the animations. It doesn't matter if you have a three-legged spaceweasel with severe scoliosis, SPORE will figure out a way to make it walk, and it'll somehow look pretty natural. The sheer complexity of the model rigging and movement animations involved in making a totally-custom character model is mindboggling to a normie like me, but in this case I'd say I don't mind getting boggled.

												Spore is a 2008 multi-genre single-player fantasy god sandbox game developed by Maxis and designed by Will Wright.Pros: Can't get annoyed, so many possibilities of creations, an ENTIRE galaxy to discover, download other creations from other players, there's a real community around this game. Lots of secrets and even planet earth in the galaxy, the graphics aren't perfect but acceptableCons: lot of glitches/bugs, but doesn't affect the gameplay, normal and hard modes are almost impossible to play when you get to tribal stage, hard to evolve on space stage because you'll be attacked by pirates/got ecosystem issues almost every time, must clean my creations because after some times there's too much creatures to load.I think it's all. I personally rate this game 10/10, I played 1000+ hours on it when I was on windows XP.BEST game for kids or people with a whole lot of imagination, like me.			"

												Spore: Galactic Adventures is the expansion pack for the evolution/civilization/genocide simulator, Spore.You can find my review for the original game here.In Spore, reaching the Space Stage meant you could never leave your spaceship, ever.That, and the habit SOME PEOPLE had of making their creatures look like  was basically its main flaw.Though, you are allowed to ban creations from your game and people who keep getting creations banned are at risk of getting banned from online play.Spore: Galactic Adventures adds Adventures, special missions that require you to beam down to planets with your customized space captain and (possibly) your crew for an RPG-style Adventure.Since the game lets you jump straight into player-created and developer-created Adventures through the main menu, I played through Adventure Town, the Adventure to introduce you to the possibilities of the Adventure Creator.I was beamed down onto the LSD-fueled Adventure Town.Annoying music plays in the background, there's the occasional rainbow, every single NPC is dancing, and to start, you talk to the mayor, who is a toad/frog with a large moustache.His two assistants are busty frog women in flower bikinis, for some reason.You go around and talk to people who demonstrate stuff to you and eventually Captain Amazing (that is his name) says you'll become a great Captain, and the mission is mercifully over.I played some player-made adventures and eventually loaded up my Space Stage game again, soon receiving missions to go on Adventures.Most were fun.I levelled up my captain a few times, unlocking new equipment for him...until disaster struck.I had received a mission in French.I do not speak French.Why this game gave me a French language mission even though my language setting is clearly English is beyond me.While the little bullet points in each chapter (""Talk to X, Kill an X"") were in English, I had no idea what I was doing nor what any of the dialogue was.I went on an Adventure in Russian, but it had no dialogue and was made to be playable in any language.I have to commend the creator on that.While the Adventures are fun and you can create your own (you even design the planet it takes place on), it occasionally gives you a mission to go on an Adventure in a language you may not understand.That is the major flaw.Oh, and a tip: if you do get this game, do not play the Adventure ""Naked Timmy"".It's awful.

												Galactic Adventures adds missions for your space captain during the final stage of Spore. Previously during this stage you were mostly restricted to being a spaceship - which is kinda weird when you've spent so much time careful crafting the creatures that you're playing with and this was meant to address that.On the plus side, it is nice to be able to play your creatures again and it does even potentially give you the ability to earn the super powers from the other factions (for example you could be militarily based, but earn a shaman super power) rather than just being restricted to one and some of the missions are kinda fun, although there is often a quite heavy focus on combat which is still not great and you don't have any equips for initially.The down side though... It was a bit of a half arsed attempted by Maxis to cash in on user content and the amount of missions actually included with it by default seems to be rather small. Places will send you off to do a mission and when you arrive there you'll find it's a mission you have already played. Now at this point you can only progress by completing it again, but because you've already done it once you won't receive any experience for it. This won't stop other planets sending you on this mission again and again though. Player created content is frequently dross and the filtering system is largely unintuitive making it very hard to make sure you actually get any decent adventures.Each adventure also eats a planet. Did that planet have an expensive spice on it? Too bad. Is it contantly sending out signals to tell you there is a rare hidden there? Too bad. Once it's an adventure mission, even if it's a duplicate, it will sit there cutting off access to that planet forever. Since planets tend to generate them in nearby systems this can result in areas, especially around your starting systems becoming cluttered with unusable mission planets.Galactic Adventures is a great idea that was badly implemented and promptly dropped by the studio rather than being fixed. Whilst it definitely adds some much needed creature time to the space stage I don't feel it adds enough longevity to actually be worth it. If you already have Spore, pick it up during a sale if it goes decently low.			"

												This game is incredibly great. This game is by far the best space civilization game I have played. and it also has all those other stages like creatur. But EA has abandond this game. Thats right, no more updates no more bug fixes, not even the extremely huge ones. It pains me that EA just took a really great game and punched a whole through it. and all the great creators have stopped playing and stop creating and just disappeared.Now it was very tempting to say that i should not recommend this game, but then I thought of its pros, and SO many outnumbered the cons. With its seemingly infinite files and an interesting load screen. the references in the adventures, and the grox, and the galaxy. Setting a goal to destroy the grox and set a colony on EVERY single planet in existance, or to allie with the grox and destroy EVERY single planet in existance is a HUGE goal. To find the ""third rock from sol"" and setting a colony. Completing the all the acheivments. It is one heck of a game, and I'd say that this game is most certainly worth your time. And who knows, maybe EA will get their minds staight and patch this game up some day, and maybe have commercials on the TV and get more players on.			"

												Spore is really fun, you get to start life as a cell and evolve up to being super intelligent. Best part is you can customize everything on your creature from how it looks to if its a herbivore, omnivore or carnivore. My first creature ended up looking like some weird pink cow by generation 7 lol.I recommend buying Spore with the creepy & cute pack and the galactic adventures DLC. But something to note is that Steam has a bug and lists the DLC as seperate games on your library. You MUST install all 3 separately and then run galactic adventures to have access to the base game, the creepy and cute pack and galactic adventures.			"

												If you are considering buying SPORE, you should also consider buying Galactic Adventures. Unlike the original game, in Galactic Adventures you will be able to create worlds with advanced but easy-to-use tools. Simple, yet you can have a lot of fun messing around in the adventure creator. It also adds the adventures to be played in Space stage when you visit other planets, although it's not much fun. Creating is the best part of this game. If you feel bored when playing the original game, just jump into galactic adventures. I'll be honest, if you expect a game with good combat, awesome graphics and great voice acting, this is not the game for you. If you expect a game you can put time into and creating worlds you would have otherwise be good at drawing and writing to do, this is the game for you. Definitely one of the best games I've played, before it was on steam as a kid and I loved it. Maybe I am looking through nostalgia goggles, but I think it's great. Definately a good so called ""casual"" game where you can just mess around in when you get bored. Also, it's very child friendly. My siblings have stacked tons of hours on my account just playing this. If you have enjoyed games such as Garry's Mod or Minecraft then you'll love this.			"

												User generated content for Spore: GA is hit-or-miss with emphasis on miss. Many missions are awkward, hardly playable, runarounds, etc... Maxix made a strong DLC, expanding the original game greatly, but often I avoid taking missions of GA type because they can be really bad. Even those made by Maxix can feel a bit tedious. Otherwise, I repeat, the content is great, and actually gettiong into the editors can be as rewarding as making portal chambers in Portal 2.			"

												If there were a number rating system instead of yes or no, this would be so much easier, but since I have given it my own score of 8.25. These are the Pros and Cons.PROS:Seemingly Endless Imagination- The character creation in this game is so astounding I fell in love with this game many years ago at a friend's house.Great AI Interactivity-This game is great when it comes to communicating with AI, you can insult them, do quests for them, go to war, trade, and more. A Whole Galaxy to Explore-This game takes place in a single galaxy with tons of different alien races and intergalatctic governments at war with eachother.CONS:A Bit Buggy-There are a few bugs, mainly just when a character walks around, their legs sometimes look like a tornado of limbs, and sometimes the map gets buggy if you tab out while paused, but when you get back to playing, it looks normal.That is about it, I really enjoy this game and I hope you do too if my review has helped you!-Sean McFarland			"

												Do you like evolution? Do you like making unholy abominations that God never intended to see the light of day? Do you like building cities, designing the buildings, terraforming then colonizing worlds? Do you ever dream about traversing black holes safely without being at the mercy of spaghettification? Have you ever wanted to start and end a star war with superior weaponry? Have you ever wanted to wage said star war with a hyper advanced, damn near endless cyborg race, but become so lazy that rather than engaging them in honorable space combat, you just destroy their planets completely, making the entire galaxy, even your allies hate you despite using it on the menace  that threatens to eradicate them as well as you? Then this game is for you.This game is a complete package of God simulator, animal simulator, civilization simulator, and space captain simulator, each poorly executed but good enough to combine into a great game to spend your time on. You can create creatures, ranging from lowly cells to space-faring civilizations. You can design most aspects of that creature's civilization as well, such as buildings, vehicles (land, sea, AND air) and space ships. Each civ gets a different alignment and ability, depending on  the choices you made with them up to the space stage. One of your allies decline your deal to buy their planet (yes, you can buy planets out from under allies)? Play the correct way and you can just call in some space pirates to harass them,  or  ya know, convert their civilization to the great and mighty Spode  (lets be honest, this ""Spode"" they are  worshipping has to be  the great and mighty Gaben). Also, you can attempt to get to the center of the galaxy and discover a secret. It is a long and arduous journey, so be well prepared, well equipped, and have plenty of healing items and planet busters. Spoiler alert: what you find is unexpected, kind of hilarious, and really helpful...for a while. Also, community feature for sharing and uploading creations. There is also the portion of the game where you create a space captain to beam down to planets for missions created by you, players, or Maxis, but we don't talk about that. It's not that it's bad, its just that it isn't good.If Maxis  does not make a sequel to this  game, then may Khorne smite them with the pain of a thousand ♥♥♥♥♥♥-tearing brick poops.

												Got this on a Steam Summer Sale for $4.99 USD BTW. Just going to throw that out there.One thing to note: You have to have the Spore core game bought and installed on Steam for this to work.WARNING: SPORE ISN'T SUPPORTED ON WINDOWS 10 BUY AT YOUR OWN RISKAnyways to the review:Spore Galactic Adventures is expansion pack to Spore a game about evolution. In this expansion you create your own adventures. an Adventure is when you land on a planet and do tasks and goals to complete a ""adventure"". Even with the games cartoonish look, there is lots of stuff you can do with it. Everything is up to you. Now let's get down to the reviewPROS:+ Addicting+ You can use all the editors from the core game in your adventure+ Fairly decent NPC AI+ Complexity always got on my nerves, but this time there's still complexity although it is set really high+ KILLING INOCCENT CREATURES+ You can make npcs talk (Chat bubbles, no voice acting) EDIT: Correction there is voice acting you just don't get to customize it. It also sounds a lot like voice acting in the sims: Complete jiberish.+ Even though you launch it seperatly, you can still play normal spore+ Lots of customization for adventures+ Nice UI+ Easy TerraformingI will add to this list when I find more.CONS:- Limited voice acting. I know they don't speak they just make noises, but sometimes it feels like their not even talking.- F*CKING BUILDINGS DON'T PLACE ON THE GROUND PROPERLY. THERE ALWAYS FLOATING HALFWAY IN THE AIR.- Terrible veichle AI. They don't follow their paths and run in to stuff.- Incredibly buggy. I sometimes get stuck in roofs and just annoying bugs like that. (probably since it's such a big game)- Can't drive veichles. You can technicly ride them, but really you just stand on top of them- Can't create you own fixed objects and game mechanics (Gates, keys, stuff like that). You can disguse them as other objects though.Will add more when I find more.7/10 doesn't sound like the Pros are better, but they are better. Very fun I would get it if you like spores editors.EDIT: I am fully aware that it works fine for people on windows 10, but I have been hearing complaints on the community that it doesn't work on win10. This is probably due to the game being old and abandon.			"

												This Expansion pack is unbelievable, its amazing, i end up spending more time on adventures than the actual game. This has to be one of the greatest Space Sandbox games around, i think its better than No Man's Sky (Yeah, i said it). You can do so much in Spore, when Spore players back in 2008 say it was over hyped I would say it was hyped, this game is perfect for me, I enjoy every Minute of it. Every Penny i spent was SO WORTH IT!For all you Russian Spore Players:Этот пакет расширения невероятно, его удивительное, я в конечном итоге тратят больше времени на приключения, чем реальной игре. Это должно быть одним из самых больших Space Sandbox игр вокруг, я думаю, его лучше, чем Sky Нет Человека (Да, я это сказал). Вы можете сделать так много в Spore, когда Spore игроки еще в 2008 году сказал, что это над раздутыми я бы сказал, это было раздутыми, эта игра идеально подходит для меня, я наслаждаюсь каждой минутой этого. Каждый пенни я потратил ТАК ЭТО СТОИТ!			"

												This game is for those who have some time to kill and have a big, wild imagination, like me. Progressing through the 5 stages is already an adventure, but as a captain in the 5th and final stage, the possibilities are practically endless(as if they weren't already)! Spore was always a favorite of mine when I was a kid, and when I heard that it was on Steam, I rushed for the opportunity to get to play it again. And I sure as hell wasn't dissapointed.Downloading modpacks for it, however, is another story. The main modpack that I desperately wanted was Dark Injection; it added all sorts of new parts; Creepy and Cute, Robot Parts, Grox Parts, Parts from the now-diceased Darkspore, and so many others! But every time I got started with downloading each part, somehow somewhere a virus kicks in, overwhelms my AntiVirus, and kills my computer. This happened 3 times in a row, and I gave up on that dream....Well, at least I have TitanSpore to keep me company.Overall, Spore is a great way to kick your creative mind into full gear, with no limits except for your imagination...And that damned Complexity Meter...DAMN IT MAXIS			"

												Despite the game nearly being TEN YEARS OLD AND HAVING NO MULTIPLAYER! It was never amazing even when it was released back in 2008, even then I realized the game had more potential, was stuck in a odd forced evolution, its mega difficult to be a peaceful player or a economy player in this game, its so much easier to kill and attack everything against you! All through creature-civilzation stage! But in space stage, it gets quite boring, but this review so far is for the base spore game, not the DLC. The space stage was a bit boring, mainly just fly around and do simple boring quests, like delievery, killing animals dangerous to eco-systems, investigate species, deliver cash to enemies. It was getting old quite quick, and when your allies would fight eachoter, there is no way to stop it, you have to pick which group to save or just let them destroy eachothers empire. But when Galactic Adventures came out, it added adventure creation which was amazing! You start off with a blank world and make a VERY difficult to create adventure, but i've seen people over the years make wonderful and fun adventures that were a real treat to play! But it there was still no way to enter your space ship or see some sort of interior of it which was quite dissapointing. There was still no multiplayer! The best thing you got was commenting on other players creations! It was a great expansion but so much more could have been put in to make the game feel more immersive and fun. But it was a good try none the less, this is a space stage DLC that needs more added but I recommend you get this DLC. But try to obtain it while its on sale!			"

												Has a few flaws, then again so does every game.I--------------Good traitsI--------------It allows more content for SPOREYou can make your own adventures on your own planet with your own creatures.More options for your space captain, including a name, crew and even an outfitter.(This is just from my experience, but SPORE Galatic Adventures crashes less than the normal SPORE does.)Lets your captain be more involved in the world.I-------------Bad TraitsI-------------Still crashes for me. (Using Windows 10)You have limited editing when it comes to creating your adventure.Animations could be a bit more polishedShould have more options for propsI--------------Overall this is a very fun game and I find myself sitting for hours on end making adventures and going through them, also spending time going through space looking for others or my own adventures. It really lets the player and their creations into the SPORE universe allowing them to become more involved.			"

As for customization... it's Spore. It's got that down pat. The story is a bit lacking, but this expansion features missions, and user-made missions to go along with that. The people can create their own story, and I love it.			"

												You don't need Spore to play this, just buy this one since it's cheaper and includes the origional Spore as well as aditional content. This game starts out as Feeding Frenzy, then it quickly turns into an RPG where your species must either befriend or destroy many enemies, then you evolve into a tribal species where the game plays like an RTS, where you must kill or befriend other species that are tribal as well. Then you evolve again into a species that controls the world, but other cities or continents on your starting planet are not under your control, so you must build land, sea and air vehicles to either kill, befriend or religeously brainwash each other to take control over the entire planet. After globalising your home planets spice collecting operation, your species will be unified and develop a space ship, and the game becomes a 4X in space, where you have to terraform and colonise the 500,000 planets in the Milkyway. Here, the game really becomes open ended, you collect the spice from your empires planets, and sell to others at a profit. You can find other empires, all of which use randomly generated species as well, and talk to them, forge an alliance with them, request help, declare war, even ask them to go to war with another empire for you. There are many upgrades you can find and buy for your ship, from being able to terraform the planet, to being able to blow it up entirely. The only nuisance is having to scroll the mousewheel to enter and exit a planet or solar system, which gets annoying since you will be doing it a lot.Also, the Galactic adventures are basically garbage. Your not missing out on much if you ignore there existance in the space stage. The planet editor that comes with it is fun to mess around with, but it's not really complex enough to create interesting and dynamic scenes, like the level editors of other games. It's cool how you can replay them after finishing them though by just flying back to the same planet.Also, the online doesn't work anymore, which means you can't share your creations with others online, or use or see theirs, which is a shame. But the game comes with something like 2000+ creations anyway, and you can still make your own. "

												*NOTE* i have played both the original spore and this expanson pack away from steam since i had it on a disk, and when i lost it i bough it during a sale.*CONSI personally love this game, but unless you allready have an EA accont you wont be having much fun with Galactic Adventures.Luckuly i had the game during its golden age, where it was a bit active in terms of more content created by players and people were discovering how wonderfully strange this game was.Sadly maxis just left it rather than keep the game going.I do have an EA account prior to the whole server shutdown business and can still access extra adventures, but they crash upon completion.And without completion nor new adventures this really isn't much else than a planet scenario editor with some cosmetic items for your creatureEDIT: The custom adventures and maxis adventures work, turns out my old PC did not like them. I still cannot recommend as you will only see around 5 adventures before needing more. There may be ways to get more but i'm not entirely sure.EDIT EDIT: Well looks like owners of the steam version of the vanilla SPORE can actually access EA servers as long as you get that CD key through to origin thanks to this guide: 


How to connect to Spore servers / link EA account! (Working) 
A Guide for Spore
By: Dayvo

			Spore is a pretty decent game, I loved it back in the day, but since I bought it on Steam I couldn't connect to the Spore servers. So how do you do this you may ask?		


As for the expansions? Galactic adventures? i cant confirm, but some users had luck. Personally just buy the game through origin if you want to avoid this haffafle.*Since there is a fix, this review is at heart POSITIVE however i would advice against buying any expansions through steam because they are not certain to work, and due to this overall is stays negative*			"

												This game is a masterpiece in my opinion.I'm pretty sure I spent 3000+ hours on this game when I was a bit younger.The game never ends with this expansion. With this expansion, the game you can finish in one day, changes into a game  you can play for years.I spent most time creating adventures in the adventure editor. Players can create the weirdest things with countless objects in the game. It felt great to make the fantasies in my mind about aliens and monsters an actual story in a game that everyone can play.But ofcourse, not everyone likes creating these adventures, since it's pretty boring sometimes: Sometimes you spend over 3 days to finish just one adventure. And I made over 200 hah.If you don't like creating adventures, you can go to the God Almighty massive Sporepedia where thousands of adventures made by other players are waiting to be played. By doing these, you gain XP for one of your captains, a creature you made who can be used for playing adventures and the whole evolution story mode thing.Gotta be honest, I never finished the campaign after playing this for 3000 hours. I never even tried. I spent most time creating levels, but I also spent a lot of time playing them.If you like creating things, Spore is the game for you. If you want to take it a step further by using the things you make however you want, this expansion is the expansion for you.			"

ONLINE TROUBLESHOOTINGfirst before u even start the game u need to goto Origin (ea's online store thing) create an account and add your cdkeys from steam into your origin account.too late? u already tried to get online and it didn't work. well try to goto origin and add your cdkeys now. if you got your cd keys added but still cant get online then u need to close the game and delete the login.prop file... (default newer windows Delete C:\Documents and Settings\<your name>\Application Data\Spore\Preferences\login.prop). thats what i had to do and it worked.save often.Creature stage - if you die press the esc key on your keyboard as fast as possible. if u delay. or if u click the icon on the bottom right corner of the screen with your mouse the game may or may not crash. this was the only gamestopping bug i encontered.depsite those flaws this game is awesome. I bought this game back in 2008 and hated it. decided to try it again and fell in love. right now im at the space stage and i've almost got all the upgrades and all the badges and it is getting repetetive. im gonna look for some mods that might help that. not sure what mods are available for this game. simple things like saving base layouts so when u colonize a t3 planet u dont have to do the building layouts over and over again. instant travel would be nice as well. as the delay in zooming in and out from solar system to universe becomes unenjoyable after so long. had a bad experience with the adventures. not my thing.

												Spore: Galactic AdventuresStory - See the playtime up there? ^ That isn't my actual playtime, I had the disc version of this quite some time ago, I probably have around 600 hours put into this. Anyway, the story is amazing. A story about evolution. You start off as this tiny fish thing, then as a creature that has legs and arms and all, then your creature decides to turn into a caveman, then go really civilised, then you're off in space! It is simply amazing. 10/10Storyline Length - Oh believe me, this isn't one of those games you can finish in a few hours. Should take you a full week.AI - Pretty intelligent and can be funny at times! As expected, it depends on you though. Attack or make friends with them. This game even has Mega Creatures, meaning, THE CREATURES ARE BLOODY HUGE! 10/10Experience - You can make your own creatures anytime using the creator, you can make vehicles, spaceships, buildings, even missions! I'm telling you, you'll have SO much fun with this game. You pretty much play God! Btw, in the creator, if you run out of DNA points or you've put so many stuff on your creature that it wont let you, here are cheats!CTRL + SHIFT + C = Opens up cheat console thingadddna = Adds DNAfreedom = Editor limits increased 10/10Graphics - Can't say much, this is a 2009 game, but for that year, these are amazing graphics. You can still clearly see what your creature looks like and all! 10/10Sounds / Voice Acting - Just. Play the game. Stop reading. This review. Buy. It. Now. THE SOUNDS ARE GREAT. Lots of detail into the creature sounds, just. Everything. DETAIL. 10/10Controls - You can use arrows, you can use WASD, you can use the mouse, seriously, this game is freedom. Play this once, get addicted, play this a lot. 10/10Overall - 10/10Good God! You are God! Play this! Stop reading this review already and just... DO IT! YES YOU CAN! YESTERDAY, YOU SAID TOMORROW. SO JUST. DO IT! MAKE YOUR DREAMS. COME TRUE!			"

												This game has genuinely blown me away. Originally I bought the sale bundle for my 11 year old daughter, but within 2 hours of watching her play I'd bought my own copy.So, what do you do...well, you start as a single cell organism, evolve, develop on land, create a tribe, then a city, then a civilization, conquer your home world through ""religion"", economics or warfare then and eventually travel space completing on surface adventures with hundreds of differing alien races, or just explore and trade in a galaxy of thousands of starts and planets, all proceduarally generated, with life forms that do interact and exhibit their own behaviours, discover new flora and fauna, crystals, and artifacts, languages etc, all the time upgrading your ship, clothes, skills and colonies.The premise is ridiculously ambitous and yet everything above happens in realtime, and brilliantly too, it is, pretty much everything No Mans Sky promised, just written 10 years ago....it is absolutley unbelievable and for the few pounds you'll pay, just brilliant.

												I'm writing this review as a positive outlook on the game, but there as still a few issues. One, the servers are very unstable; you have to re-login everytime after you exit the creator and want to share your creation, two, the game crashes very often, especially when the game accidentally downloads a Creepy and Cute creature, it doesn't even show that you don't have that DLC! There could've been more parts, I've seen Maxis cells have parts that players can't access, which is very bizarre. In addition, I would love to see a sequel of this game; the enhancements, additions, replacements, and removal of issues could be a lot better. I guarantee that if you ask every player that owns Spore, if you asked them if they would like a Spore 2, over 90% would say yes.  Overall, this DLC allows you to install mods, create adventures, I'm glad I chose to get this DLC first. Adventure creating is time-consuming, but it's worth it in the end. That is the end of this review, I highly recommend this DLC and game, and check out my guide on Adventure creating!			"

												Bestest game I've played on Steam after the original Spore. It has tons of new features like the Captain Outfitter, and the Adventure Creator. The game crashes occasionally, but it's still awesome otherwise. If you loved Spore, chances are you'll like the Galactic Adventures expansion.			"

												This game was simple but enjoyable up to Tribe stage. I liked to construct my cell in the beginning, I liked to travel the land as Animal, upgrading myself even more. I was slightly troubled by Tribe stage, because it feels the same as Animal, only worse, with no new abilities and the very limited set of equipment. Very quick stage, though.But then Civilization stage came, and I gave up. It's RTS in it's worst sense: without smart pause, with miniature semi-blind map, quirky controls and the very fast speed. Thank you, but no thank you. Without me.I suppose, it could be enjoyable for someone else though, not so slow as me.			"

												Spore is and will always be my favorite game. Why? Because:1. It is beatifull. Even though it was created in 2009. The collors creatures the trees or even the milkyway. Everything is well made.2. It runs good. Even though EA quited updating it a long timw ago it still runs great!3. It is just plain out good. Creating your own species. Letting it grow from cel till spaceman. Every step you can choose. How will it look? What will it eat? How will my building look like? Hack you can even create your own song at your city. And every choise wil have affect on you in a later state.Welps this was a long review. Haha. I just love this game. So give it a chance.			"

												I love this game. It is one of the best Spore Games. You can visit and negotiate with tribes from other planets! You can go visit a fishing shack by a river bursting with fish. There are many effects, fixed objects, and etc. to chose from. You can even use your own creations or find creations from other people. I also personally favor the captain editor. What are you waiting for? Get the game!			"

												Create the universe. Expand existence on planets. Conquer galaxies beyond sight, And choose the future in this wonderful creative game of Spore. Watch the trailer, And you will want to buy this game.Spore is the best I have ever played. The first game I have ever played on steam and it is a WINNER. The trailer is interestingly funny and awesome. Create the future of your single species (No pun intended), And simulate the creator of all things in a universe, Be their ""god"" that guides the existence on a planet. Become the pillars of creation that created the universe. I reccomend you buy this game for it is WORTH BUYING.Enjoy observing life on a planet that goes through the many intense and epic discoveries and troubles and challenges of a normal human life.Now...Things have changed in the Spore world...Create the universe...And enter the Space Stage...The last stage in a regular life of Spore, But wait...In this action-packed expansion DLC/Pack, There be one more stage in life. Not only will you be a starship captain in the space stage, But now you take your starship captain, You name him, And you control him as he thouroghly looks for trouble on different planets.In this expansion(That must require Spore),You have the ability to beam down onto planets and solve their problem!Now wait a minute...Captain Spore Creature has found something quite interesting...Now you get to create your own problems and adventures and visit them!I have made my Captain Spore Creature make a problem with a King Kong Banana hanging off a mountain and boy is it fun to destroy that banana. After all you got to watch what you eat these days...But My imagination isn't all just Giant Bananas hanging off mountains...It can be many other things!Spore...Galactic Adventures...What Planet Are YOU Going To Save Next?

												Spore: Galactic Adventures is fun, simple and great for kids to create little games. Sure you can't do much, but the game really is for the younger crowd. It's so post to be simple and easy to learn, which it is. This DLC type game is great for people who like adventure and people who like to create. It adds very little to the space aspect of spore, but it's great for people to share what they have created and to show what they can do. There isn't much to say about this game other than it's fun, it's simple, as stated before, and it's really interesting to see what the fan base of Spore can create.8/10, great for kids and for people who like to mess  around and enjoy themselves.

												I've played this game on and off for years and now recentaly got it on sale £5 for spore and GA ,wow what a bargain.Now for the game : It's incredible, from swimming about as a cell to full on empire with a different gameplay for each stage is just one small reason why, add to that the creation of anything you can imagine (almost) and flying around in a ship on planet or off plus so much more.Moving on to the GA side of things, the captian system is a great addition and actually being able to walk the planets( with missions) just makes this the best space exloration/empire building/trading and much more game ive ever played and possibly the only one of its kind.If youv'e never played this game and love space then its a must own for you( assuming you enjoy empire building games ,since its one of the main parts in space stage though not the only thing and even people who don't like empire games may still enjoy this).The one thing that would make this game better would be multiplayer saves for you and your friend/s to play. Starting on different planets and building or fighting together or against each other.There is so much more to this game i've not even gone into but that's something for you to discover.And lastly a shout out to Steve ;)			"

												I don't think I had this much fun since Black & White. This game is amazing. So much customization in this game.This game starts off as a meteors hits a planet and your species begin as a single cell organism. Then, one you ate enough food, you can evolved into a beast to hunt, make allies, or do both. Later, you can become a tribesman and destroy or ally other tribes, or again, do both, this will turn from an action-like game to a Real-Time Strategy game. Then, you start a civilization to take over the world with Military, Economy, or Religion. Once all those are done, you get an archetype of each choice you do and begin space exploration.The game has complete creator from creatures to outfitters to vehicles to buildings, heck, even your own adventures for your captain on this expansion!Get this game if you're want to try making your dream species in a game!

												Great game once you get the hang of it.Is actually 5 different games.just when you learn how to grow your microbe,, the game evolves you into a very different creature. when you start getting the hang of that, then it evolves into a tribe of creatures to work with, then you evolve into a society looking for planetary unity. then when you get your planet evolved, you become a space cadet, which is by far the funnest, due to missions and freedom of choice.that's as far as I got so far and obviously lots of adventures and things to find ahead. will it evolve again?Each stage gives you the choice on whether to use diplomacy, friendship or brute force to get your way, and each stage allows you to design your character, it's home, and vehicles. millions of possibilities and infinite repayabilty.I look forward to a second playthru now that I know a bit of what's going on. but you can start at whatever stage you want. It will be worth the price just to play ""Galactic Adventures"" stage. I have been amazed at the variety of missions you can go on. even galactic adventures seems like several different games. there are space battles, colinization, teraforming, puzzle solving and item retrieval missions, and probably much more.Buy it and enjoy the variety.

												I like evolving my own species. How about you? I'm introducing Spore: Galactic Adventures. The original Spore does the same, Galactic Adventures is just an expansion pack, improving Space stage only. When I first started this game, I was expecting, not a only a galaxy, but an entire universe to explore. I was a bit disappointed when I found out that it was only a galaxy to explore.What do you do in Spore? You evolve your customizable species from a single cell stage to a technologically advanced species capable of interstellar space travel. But keep one thing in mind...You are not alone...In the galaxy, other aliens will be evolving on another habitable planet. They could be in creature, tribal, civilization or even in space stage. You can even communicate and buy items from them. When your in interstellar space, you can go to other solar systems and setup a colony on one of those planets or a gas giant moon.Whatever your species is, a carnivore, herbivore or omnivore, the amount of planets you can visit is a larger number than all stars in the galaxy.

												When I first bought spore in 2008, I was massively disappointed it wasn't the game that was initially shown. Now it's five years later and I like this game a hell of a lot more. I don't know if it's been patched into being better or it's just four years of being seperated from the hype. Very fun game now.Important notes: I had a lot of issues getting the online features to work. You have to have a CD key to make an online account, and despite this expansion running seperately from Spore, only Spore comes with a CD key. My copy of Spore came with an expired CD key and I had to appeal to Origin support to get it functioning. It was a chore. The online features also silently disconnect a lot so watch out for that.

												Gave a bad review for Spore, going to give another, different opinion on Galactic Adventures.Reinstalled it awhile ago so that when I had relatives (children) visiting they would have something to play that wasn't A) age inappropriate and B) wouldn't ask me questions or have me complete a stage/quest/enemy every five minutes.  I don't mind helping but when a kid is basically having you play the entire game for them, that game is not for them.  Said kids were absolutely delighted by Spore and I realized what my issue with it was in the first place.Simply put, this is a game that doesn't know who it's target audience is.  Or maybe I misinterpreted who it's demographic is and said hey, you can make stuff, this game is for me.Spore / Galactic Adventures, is, a great game for kids (with some exceptions)... It's cartoony, whimsical, and they can flex their imaginations with the creature creation.  However, there are a few principles that a very young child will have difficulty grasping.  My neighbor's kid (a seven year old) loved the tide pool and loved the animal stage but once he got to the civilization stage it went south real fast.  So maybe nine or ten is the ideal age here.That said, there is some absolute talent behind some of the player made creatures/vehicles etc and I'm going to take a guess that those folks are adults.  I had fun with the creation aspect of the game too.  This is where the game has it's identity crisis for me.  Some of it is appealing to adults, some of it is childish, but the whole of it appeals to neither at the same time.  Finally, the concept itself is a novel idea and one that I hope can be refined some day- in a different game.Once that novelty has worn off, all that's left is a tedious cycle of traveling between planets, trading spice (literally the only thing you get to trade), looking at butt ugly creatures my neighbor's kid made (sorry, kiddo!), running home to defend against raiders, and terraforming- things that sound exciting at first and are exciting at first, and then get promptly beaten with a tediousness stick.

												Everything I make in this game is awesome and adorable. It's like biological Lego. I can start a creature as a protozoa and live its life all the way through the race for sentience and then into space! I think it's one of the most clever games Maxis has every put together, and Maxis puts together a lot of clever stuff.One thing: once I got to the space age and was cruising around in my ship, flying the ship made me extremely dizzy and I vomited. That's not really a problem with the game, probably has more to do with my eyes or my inner ear or something, I'll just have to remember to take spaceflight in small doses.In other words, 10/10, would risk vomiting again.

												Spore is a unique game where you start off as a cell and work your way up to the King of the Universe. Not many games are like that. Each phase allows a unique experience and the expansion packs augment this adventure. The gameplay or style may not be for everyone, but it is certainly worth picking up. In conclusion, you won't buy one game; you'll buy five--or six if you get the expansions.			"

												Spore is a unique game where you start off as a cell and work your way up to the King of the Universe. Not many games are like that. Each phase allows a unique experience and the expansion packs augment this adventure. The gameplay or style may not be for everyone, but it is certainly worth picking up. In conclusion, you won't buy one game; you'll buy five--or six if you get the expansions.			"

												This♥♥♥♥♥♥was my CHILDHOOD!!!!! I nabbed the SPORE bundle for $12.99 (my game disks got damaged and the graphics got ♥♥♥♥ed up and couldn't be fixed) during the Steam Summer Sales this year to relive the good times and my nostalgia levels are off the charts already. I only got this game a week ago and I already hav 70 hours invested in this game. It was super addictive back in the day and it still is today, despite the community being a bit...quiet, these days.Enough ramblings. here are the pros and cons:Pros:1) You feel like a god2) Can make almost anything you want3) Easy controls4) Creature Creator's easy to work with5) A cheat menu is made easily accessible by pressing Contrl + Shift + C and typing in help6) SPACE!7) No invisible walls8) True open world gameCons:1) Glitches are frequent2) You might get randomly logged out3) Creating adventures is difficult starting out4) Maxis has abandoned the game, so don't expect any new updates or bug fixes			"

												Everything I make in this game is awesome and adorable. It's like biological Lego. I can start a creature as a protozoa and live its life all the way through the race for sentience and then into space! I think it's one of the most clever games Maxis has every put together, and Maxis puts together a lot of clever stuff.One thing: once I got to the space age and was cruising around in my ship, flying the ship made me extremely dizzy and I vomited. That's not really a problem with the game, probably has more to do with my eyes or my inner ear or something, I'll just have to remember to take spaceflight in small doses.In other words, 10/10, would risk vomiting again.

												It's a great idea and actually made pretty well. The first and second night I was pretty much addicted.At endgame it has the Galactic Adventures to spice things up while you're trying to build, protect and maintain your new space empire.That's where the snag hits... The base game has a very limited number of Adventures, relying heavily on the community to make more. The ones inflicted on me were in Japanese or Russian and all but one poorly made, in one case in a way that prevents finishing the mission.In conclusion, this would be a great game if more reliable adventures were available. Without it's fun for 2-3 evenings.			"

												Omg I love this game so my little heart's content, it mainly relies on your creativity, planning, skill, and how you want to proceed your goals...althogh DO NOTbuy this on steam BUY IT ON EA. So im going to tell you straight i couldn't go a day without this game in my library or i would die...not really. But still GET THIS GAME NOW it's...impossible to put it into words from me...and it will NOT be updated ever after they left spore for darkspore, they left it where it was and darkspore failed so thats when the spore franchise died in the void...but you can still see the cracks edges and beauty behind the distractions...so please get this game it will change your life for the good...if your not a stubborn brat.

												As sad as it is that Spore discontinued when there was quite the work that could be done to expand this even further, and as much as we all hate EA and their shetty ways with SecuROM and max-3-installs-per-CD-purchase to prevent privacy (which only managed to make actual buyers feel ripped) Spore was and is one of the most awesome simulation games ever made by EA along with the Sim-series (no not you SimCity idgaf bout you (jk I just haven't played it))Considering how EA Maxis ""left the game to rot"" back in 2011, the community still stands ongoing and strong, check the sporepedia and the sporums if in doubt, and that's partly what makes this so awesome - Spore in itself is a quite nice game, but with the GA expansion it took it all up a notch from a simple simulation-creature-creator game unto a whole new world where you can ""create your own games and storylines"" so to say, which is why I love this piece of goodness in my gameventory. I have had quite a few troubles with this, such as the robot packs DLC only being given out to people in the US making me weepweep a little, but after a 20 minute call to a foreign country because EA didn't care to make customer service in a shetty place as Denmark (I suppose I can understand that, but really) I finally got my free robotpack and all, because being an artist and a creative soul I need all the building blocks I can have to get the max out of this game. Usually these wouldn't be available for anyone who didn't get the code back in like 2011, so I'm pretty privileged to have an account from 2015 with the registered parts. WHICH IS TERRIBLE. This should be made free for all, and this is one of the few downsides to Spore. The technical issues within this game, due to the fight on pirates is initially what ruined a lot of it's potential.So it's a game you gotta take for what it is. There'll be no underwater stage, no female voice syncing no new patches and no cool new expansion packs in near (nor probably far) future, but at least the game has a hell of a lot of replayability, a lot of opportunities that relies on the player's creativity as well as opportunities for the player to make their own game within this game! It's gameception! I'd warmly suggest this for any person enjoying creative single-player simulation, exploring and adventuring.			"

												One of the things about Spore that I was excited to try was interacting with other players creations. Particularly with people I knew. Creating my own blob monstrocities was fun but the online interaction that used to work is no longer there. A huge dissapointment playing this game a few years late. Its not worth it now as the world gets dull fast without all of the online features.			"

												Please excuse the low play time, I only recently re-purchased this game.Spore is a world of ups and downs. Up? Pretty much all of it. Down? The fact there most likely will not be a sequel. Especially with this DLC, it adds much more depth to the entire Space Stage. Whilst I don't think it's worth spending $50 to get all the DLC, get it on sale, and you will not regret it. I have been playing the game on older computers since 2009, and I still play it today. Trust me when I say, the game is worth buying.Pros: Amazingly fun even after multiple runsBrilliant to design creaturesYou can attach giant versions of male genitalia and then share the resultsCons: Each stage could be more fleshed outNo sequel forthcoming9/10			"

												A great game, you can create your own caracter and your own story. It is the ultimate game for a person with a creative mind. It starts of quite simple an gets harder along the way, so it is fun for all ages. When you reach the final stage the game only just begins. So much to do, so much to explore a real great game.			"

												Im here to give my fair and honest opnion. This game is honestly the best game you or I will ever play. Yes it came out in 2009, yes it's claimed to be one of maxis's greatest failures. I have 93 hours in this game and I still play it. I hope and wish Spore 2 would come out,but from what I have gathered Spore 2 wont be coming out for a very long time. (DARKSPORE DOESNOT COUNT!)			"

												[Same review as SPORE]I'll start with this: I did not have any hype when this game came out, I was playing other games and probably was not even aware of this game so I have not paid 80$ nor had hype for this game.It's a good game, it has a lot of flaws but it's a good game, there could be better animations because those in game are clunky and all glitchy, we should have more freedom such as being able to play as an epic, more way of creating a creature (things such assemetry), more and a lot more parts for the creatures, planet creator/editor, being able to create our own parts, perhaps some God powers for when you're far in the game, more diversity, better textures, better models (the parts you put on your creature, some times, It's just too weird that it is seriously annoying to watch your creation) and lot of other things as well as gameplay stuff.For example, why can't we see tribes while in the creature stage or even the other stages from later? The only thing I have seen are the ships and that's rare plus they barely do anything.It's a great sandbox game, it's the only one that exist that does that other than the up-coming indie game that looks similar, called The Universim.Even though it's good, it's pretty basic, nothing complexe, not so great, doesn't have a lot of content and missing lot of stuff that it should have to make it the greatest experience of all.But after all, It is the only one in this exact genre so go for it, it's totally worth it while on sale.SPORE Galactic Adventures: A cool addition to the game, it adds a lot of replay ability but there are also lot of problems with the expansion, lot of bug, glitches and all the clunky problems you had in SPORE.Would still suggest it while on sale so you're better getting the complete pack while it's on sale for a few dollars.7.5/10 - SPORE8/10 - SPORE Galactic Adventures - Not the greatest expansion ever but still better than most of the ""expansions"", DLCs and microtransactions crap we get today.

												Well, I do not find this adds anything of value to the game.  It tries to be a different more juvenile game.  Galactic adventures would be better suited to a separate game perhaps focused on children.  The adventures are just too silly and pathetic for adults.This is just personal opinion, but I find this version seems to detract from the immersion the original game offers.  The best is the Creepy and Cute version, as it adds creative elements without interfering with the original feel of the game.  It is too bad they could not use the original UI, to perform the stories and scripting for Galactic Adventures.  I feel this version comes off like a separate add-on, or a mod overlying the original and getting in the way.  Galatic adventures should have been released like DarkSpore was, as a separate game entirely.Perhaps Galactic Adventures would be better if the scripting provided greater depth, and if the planetary adventures did not block you from visiting the planets via the normal means whilst playing the game.I gave this an upvote, because the underlying game is still well worth the play.  I bought all three verisons, and I find this one dissappointed me, the others I like VERY much.			"

												I have played the CRAP out of this game. Sure, it says I haven't played much, but I just bought it on a newer computer and I played probably about over two hundred hours. The game is ASTOUNDING! You start off as an organism floating in a distant planet's ocean, then evolve to a creature on land. Then you gain a good enough intellect to have a village, and then-you guessed it-cities! And I won't spoil the last one. JUST BUY THIS GREAT GAME!			"

												Great game... although I am greatly disappointed in how buggy this thing really is. Come on Maxis get it together here. I was playing the game but I had to stop after my game froze while naming my captain. Since then I have been unable to name any new creations I have made, which has lead to me being terribly frustrated. Great job EA-Maxis, you re-affirmed why I don't buy your games or why I shouldn't waste my time on your franchise.			"

												Would have been a good game, but sadly you can't create a Spore account with Steam, which ruins the whole point of this DLC as you cannot view other peoples adventures or share your own. I looked for 3 hours and did not find a fix.There are some guides with ""fixes"", but following those instructions takes hours and you end up with nothing.Another negative thing of the game is limitation. You can only add a few stages in each game and then it's limited, so you cannot make a fun big adventure, you'll have to copy the map and make like 10 different chapters. It sucks. I'm sorry, I cannot recommend this game.			"

												Spore was fun and I enjoyed the Creepy & Cute expansion, but Galactic Adventures offers very little to the game. The game community is expected to create their own adventures, props, planets, and everything else. Leveling up your captain is a joke and takes FOREVER to do. I think the thing I most dislike is the fact that every prop you make is made with the vehicle and building makers and as such considered by the game to be a ship or building. Want to make a fence or a signpost for your adventure? How about a bush or plate of spaghetti? You are now going to see just about every alien race you encounter using those items as their homes or ships. The other thing that gets me is that most of the adventures I have downloaded from online (I haven't done this in a year or two) do NOT work. Most are incomplete and look terrible. So yeah just get the Spore and Creepy & Cute, don't bother with this one.			"

												DONT BUY IF YOU WANT TO USE ONLINE FUNCTION.Tried to get support through EA who hasnt been helpful at all. Out of fear of losing my refund, I had to give up on getting help. First day I sent a ticket asking for help. It says the wait time was about 5 minutes. No answer. Second day I reactivated my ticket, no help, sent another ticket asking politely for help. Still no help. Third day I made 2 more tickets, that is 4 tickets in all. Admittedly I was a bit more blunt saying frankly that I havent had help for 2 days and would really appreciate it, still trying to be nice. Still. No help. Now I have had been trying to solve this problem before I even bought the game. I had this problem a long time ago and had no help in solving it.EA has literally non-existent support, the same goes for their games. Their games are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and overpriced. Now I admit, this game is amazing if not for EAs lack of care into it. The devs here though overseen by EA did a great job making it but a terrible job mentaining it.Again, there is NO online support. At least for me there hasnt been. Ive spent 2 hours googling online and contacting EA to get help with no help at all. Of course, EA does this all the time and is the WORSE video game company I know. From the Sims to Call of Duty, to all their other games, they have only been seeking money overpricing their content for less than worth of playtime and usage. Now if you dont mind spending money on a game thats been abandoned and has no online function, go for it. I got this on sale and will be refunding.IN SHORT, JUST DONT BUY.			"

												The only reason I posted it as a negative review, was to tell you all to watch out. When I first bought this, I had thought that this expansion pack would allow me to beam down to any old planet during the space stage. It returned to me as a surprise when I figured out that the only time you are allowed to do this in the space stage is when you take on an adventure mission.Other than all of that, this add on is rather interesting. You can make your own adventures and beam yourself down on those planets to snoop around and expand on what Spore once was. This part does not relate much to the expansion itself, but with this mod, you can also download a large variety of mods from the internet to change your Spore experience. I myself, fancy the ""Play as an epic"" mod.			"

												The game may be abandoned, but some people still make things, including me!I would recommend this game to ANYONE. You create a creature, watch it grow, help it survive and much more!But This DLC? It's awesome.Yet again, abandoned, but YOU can make an adventure or play old ones, maybe even new ones if someone makes one!EDIT: So a while back I found out that if you didn't play before a certain time, you couldn't acces online features, and I had a really bad pc that was the only one able to paly this game online.But then it happened, the pc would never start up again, and now I can't acces the online, I am stuck out of the eternal void I got stuck into, and that is bad.I really hope someone tries to revive this game, like someone buying the rights, because maxis has been shut down and I feel that no other studio will be able to make a sequal or an update that makes it better, EA will probably just set them to make a bunch of dlc for a really crap sequal then shut them down.

Features range from picking/placing eyes to designing space ships and buildings. Very lighthearted game. Not much to say. If you want a fun unique game this is it. Pro -	Basically everything is awesome-	Plethora of customization-	Great conceptCons -	Game is lighthearted, so if you want a deep story you won’t get it.-	Since you design the creatures/buildings/ships there is possibility for clipping.. but since it is your design you can also fix it.

												I'm a huge fan of the SPORE series. I played it when it first came out and again when it came out on Steam (lost the original PC game after a while lol). However, I'm disappointed by Galactic Adventures. It doesn't really add another dimension to the space-age stage of SPORE like I thought it would.It plays weird. The controls are like the primitive land stage of the original game, but you can't do as much, which says a lot considering you don't do much in that stage anyway. There is really not much else to say other than this DLC doesn't add much of anything to the game. Would not recommend.			"

												I played the hell outta this game as a kid, the base game part. But the Galactic adventures expansion pack really isn't worth your money. It's one giant dissapointment after the next. Let me preface this by saying I love the original spore! Even though it's a game designed for kids and is fairly simple I still think it's really fun. The GA exspansion pack basically allows you to beam down to planets (sort of), in reality you can only beam down to planets deemed adventure planets. If you played the original spore you would know that you get missions in the space stage and going to empires and requesting mission, then they tell you the background blah blah blah. Well in galactic adventures they just say ""beam down on this planet"" with no context what so ever! Also any of the regular planets you cannot beam to them. The adventures have potential, and I've seen alot of great remakes of areas from Bioshock and other games (how it works is you make buildings in the building creator and use them to look like walls, not only is this extremely tedious but you also end up having cities in the space stage being made entirely of walls or computers...really bad) but ultimatley there is nothing to do. The weapons are just like the creature stage in that they recharge with each use and there's only four viable ones (8 in total). The other thing is you can't swap weapons in game so making a ""find this gun/tool to do that"" type adventure is impossible. Long story short is if you want to see remakes of famous seens from video games just look up minecraft remakes, because this expansion spits in the face of the original game.			"

In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.2. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.			"

Posted: November 29, 2015
												This it not another review of unfulfilled promises, because I was VERY late to the party so I have no idea what those promises were supposed to BE.  I tried really hard to like this game, but it essentially punished me the entire time I was playing it.  I don't care that the multiplayer servers have been shut down, it's just not a very good game.  Never in my life have I seen a game that was centered totally on sandboxy crafting that simultaneously made it obnoxiously and irrationally difficult to do so.  Graphics are terrible, sounds are okay if you don't mind public domain animal noises.  The game is divided into five stages:  Cell, creature, tribal, civilization, and space.As a small organism you eat bits of meat, other creatures, or plant particles in order to increase your DNA.  You get bigger, break into a larger aquatic biome, and do it again.  This stage is actually very quick, unless you want to be an omnivore, in which case you need the ONE mouth part that enables that behavior, and spend some time grinding whatever you haven't been eating.  The creature stage by far takes the longest.  This is the major developmental stage for your creatures, and all the parts are earned here.  The stage is basically nests of neutral creatures, nests of creatures that attack on sight, giant creatures you have almost no hope of defeating, bones to pick DNA parts from, and fruit.  So you make friends with other species or eat them, and tweak your creature's physiology as this is your last chance to do so.Many of the creature parts are purely cosmetic.  The ones that actually raise stats may not play nice with the other parts in terms of clipping or alignment.  I assume every creature was made with the in-game editor, and that I must be terribly bad at it since all my creatures looked like walking potatoes.  Hell, the first two races I made weren't even upright, the game is actually somewhat terrible at telling you these things.  Side note:  who puts wings in a game like this and doesn't technically enable flying?  You flap, you glide.  Your AI pack members go higher than you - always, as if to mock you.  The game was designed this way.  What the ♥♥♥♥? The tribal stage consists of half a dozen major tribes that arise from the masses of creatures.  You're given roughly 12 buildings/techs/instruments with which to make friends or destroy your enemies.  Again.  The civilization stage you finally get a proper city.  You can eventually have land, air, and sea vehicles.  One of each type.  You can design four buildings, including the city hall.  That's it.  AI is predictable, it's not even Civilization Lite.  The space stage held lots of promises of being really deep and cool, but honestly I only made it there once. I read later that there wasn't actually a lot of content for this stage, they were hoping people would make the bulk of the missions for them.   The whole game is a disappointing slog.  My tally:  1st race:  Didn't know what I was doing.  Three hours into the game, it crashed.  I heard later that the game has a problem running on newer hardware.  Since Maxis FORGOT HOW TO PROGRAM AN AUTOSAVE, my entire race and progress was gone.  2nd race:  I created an omnivore.  Or tried.  I made it to the creature stage, discovered I wasn't getting any of the appropriate mouth-parts.  Checked online, learned that to become an omnivore you have to do this in the CELLULAR stage, or not at all.   3rd race:  I made the Krogan from Mass Effect.  Murdered everything in sight.  The civilization stage felt restrictive and obnoxiously difficult somehow, though dropping nukes was fun.  I actually made it to the space stage, and I got this feeling that there would be quite a bit more cool stuff if I wasn't slaughtering everything.  This restart's on me.4th race:  I made a true omnivore, got up to the creature stage.  Befriended everyone I could, enemies that attacked me became extinct.  Advanced to the tribal stage, discovered the game had classified me as a predator.  I'm sorry what?  So I reloaded, and spent the next TWO HOURS befriending THIRTY SPECIES, watching the same literal song and dance routines over.. and over.. and OVER again.  Advanced to the tribal stage, discovered I was now in the MIDDLE of the predator rating instead of buried in the deep end.  From this, I infer that I would have to spend another two hours and befriend another thirty species to touch ""middle-road"".  I don't even think that many species can be on the planet.  I've also read somewhere that the parts you have equipped may adversely affect your alignment, so literally the ONLY THING the game has going for it still works against you.  No thanks.			"

												This expansion pack for spore.. isn't really worth it much. I love spore, dont get me wrong as some hater, but this doesn't add much for the price it is. Sure, it adds a couple of fun things like destroying a ship from the inside and solving a few puzzles, but its not my kind of expansion pack. If you like this sort of thing (RPGs) then its for you, however I dont really like RPGs. I dont have an explination for why, i've just never got that much fun out of them (however, I love ALL star wars games). So thats my review. hope this helped, bye!

												The concept of the game isn't bad- in fact, I quite enjoyed designing my creatures in the early stages (they turned out as winged, bideal tigers).The gameplay itself however, is quite boring and linear. You start as a micro-organism, then go to dry land, and eventually become sapient at which point you stop evolving your creature and enter the tribal, modern, and space age.While the first few stages involve a bit of exploration and you can assemble a small pack to follow you around, tribal and modern periods play like an extremely simple and dull RTS game. I found space the UI of the space exploration stage to be extremely unwieldly, and combat clumsy and unsatisfying.As much fun and potential as there is in designing your species, your buildings, and all your vehicles, all that effort is wasted in the gameplay itself where very little is affected.Additionally, the DRM was a hassle and despite numerous attempts, I was unable to sync my game to the Spore servers, leaving me with only the default creatures to populate my game.While perhaps not a bad way to spend an afternoon, I doubt there's any replay value to be found here.

												Disclaimer: I used to own spore on disc but got it again on steam during a sale.The servers that used to give this expansion and the base game its legitimacy are completely and totally gone. The small batch of Maxis content ultimately cannot hold up when you are loading thousands of planets each demanding an array of different creatures.For this reason I cannot recommend Galactic adventures over regular spore. The user-generated gameplay it was supposed to add is now deleted due to EA's policy on servers for old games.			"

												When this was first released. it livened up the Space stage of the game. More importantly, several quality contributers created well-fleshed out adventures. All of those creators are now offline, their adventures along with them.The adventures that remain are abhorrent, broken, uninteresting, and low quality. Cannot recommend this to anyone. Do not purchase, you will not get your money's worth. This is coming from someone who has played 160 hours on the Steam version, probably over 500 on the disk version when I was younger. TL;DR Not worth the money anymore. DO NOT PURCHASE.			"

												A DLC for a wonderful game(see my other review if you haven't seen it yet!), that adds content to a game that, in my opinion, didn't really need it. Lucky me, I got it in a pack with the regular game while on sale, so I didn't have to pay $20.00 for this. It is promoted from false advertising, and makes you think that you will go back to ground level to have Star Wars esque battles, but all it does is add more quests and a few new mechanics, with an editor/creator for said quests. It can only truly be enjoyable with an EA account that allows you to play on Quests that others made, but if not, it is not a mechanic that was needed, nor wanted by me, to be added to the game.			"

												Honestly much like spore in its early states, Galatice Adventures seemed really cool to me. When it came out however my opinion suddenly changed. The adventure maker is clunkey and a lot of the adventures you will find online made by other players are just as buggy or poorly made. There is also not a lot of new content as not many players post new adventures anymore. Spore in itself feels like a game EA shoved out of the nest too early and then forgot about to never touch again, and galatic adventures is the tumor on the head of the dying chick. Spore Galatic Advantures gets 1.5♥♥♥♥♥♥Monster Captains out of 5			"

												I bought the whole package and I really wonder why I did that. Here are some sporadic comments to the game: The game seems unfinished. Various options seems to be possible, but are not. There are bugs in the user interface. The gameplay is tedious. The creation of your animal is funny at first, but you have no real knowledge of how effective your choices are. The modern times to the game seems like another game entirely. I could write a lot more, but all in all, it is as if you are playing a game blindfolded. As the games stands now, it should be free.

												Be forewarned: I played through the first stage--cute, though simplistic--and could not get to the second stage, apparently because of a bug that causes the game to crash--thankfully, quad-core prevents my entire system from crashing, when it would have six years ago.The critter-creation system appears pretty cool, actually! With some practice and experimentation, I'm confident I could build quite a cute creature! The bug is an issue. I'll try it again in a while, and if my experience changes I'll edit this review.I bought the game and its expansions on sale. Again, it's based on a 2008 game, and I experienced the crash, which according to the forum posts from six years ago were somewhat common. I just can't recommend a game that crashes so early in the experience, unless you're willing to persevere through it.			"

												This game, and its companion Galactic Adventures, are fantastic.   I cannot, however, recommend the game. The reason i cannot do so is because EA does not properly support this product, from what I can tell.   Upon installing and running the first time, I was prompted to connect to my EA account.  That was simple enough.  The problem, however, is that the servers which handled authentication apparently were shut off some time ago,so you can't properly authenticate the game.    You'll get an error saying the code doesn't work, and if you try to use the CD key, it will say it is not valid. I tried a workaround by logging into EA's site and binding the key there, but that also doesnt' work.   It says it successfully bound to the account but doesn't connect in Steam. Contact with EA support is what gave me the information I've stated above.   The only thing I haven't tried is downloading Origin (security holes from what I've seen, so no) and then using that to obtain Spore via my linked account, separating it from Steam. This game is entirely playable without registration, but there is no access to the creations of other players, which was a major benefit to Galactic Adventures (since it has a mission builder) as well as being able to reach new creatures for Spore that others created.  I would wager this will also cause problems with downloading DLC and entering codes to activate it, as seems to be a major complaint on forums regarding this game.   The workaround is to call EA support (not email or online chat) and bounce through extensions until you get to someone who can MANUALLY ADD YOUR KEY TO THE ACTIVATION DATABASE.   It's just not worth it.    I'm reminded now why this is still the most pirated video game in history as of 2014.			"

												Cell and creature stages are somewhat fun, if a bit simple. Then tribal stage happens and it all goes downhill. Not because of gameplay even, but because of the awful controls and camera. This is the absolute worst controls and camera I have ever seen in a game, and I've played a lot of games, even those old mmo 'clickers' that make me want to cringe now.Playing the game (in tribal stage) feels like an absolute chore, literally makes you not want to, and so I wont.I just cannot understand how this actually made it past testing, past a bunch of devs, and then they released the game this way.All they had to do to fix it, is something simple: take the cell and creature controls/camera and use and expand on them for the other modes. But, no, instead it feels like they just decided 'hey lets throw out these ok camera controls and controls schemes, and completely redesign it all and make it worse, and then use that.' And then the team decided to sell the game that way.I mean how does that even happen?! Did not one person, one dev, complain and say 'well this is just awful can't we just use the managable cell/creature controls/camera instead?' But nope.Anyway, I can't recomend the game like this. I really regret buying the game because of the tribal control scheme/camera, and normally I could just deal with it and either find some fix online (there isn't one for spore), or muddle through awful controls in a game to play, but I can't with this one. It feels just that bad to me.			"

												Let me start off by saying I'm reviewing Galactic Adventures instead of regular Spore because I think Galactic Adventures provides the biggest experience, and it's pretty much the same thing as Spore but with the adventures. My opinion here can also be applied to normal Spore.God, do I love Spore. Waaaaay too much. It's one of my most favorite games of all time, but at the same time, it's brought hate and anger not only upon myself, but upon my close friends.I know, I need to explain. It would seem that it's an unfair judgment to say this is one of my favorite games considering I only have 33 hours logged on it and I've only had it for a few weeks (at the time I'm writing this review), but I've owned the CD-ROM version since it came out, and I'm pretty sure I've spent hundreds upon hundreds of hours playing it. As someone who's soon to be 16 and grew up with a different era of games, this is one of the biggest games to define my childhood (considering I was about 9 or 10 when it came out). I got addicted to it, and sadly, my friends did, too. Every single friend I've shown Spore to, they got addicted to it, and it became the center of every friendship I had. Sadly, Spore wasn't multiplayer, so I had to constantly watch my friends play Spore when they came over. They weren't open to anything else, just Spore. It became incredibly boring and repetitive, and because of that, many fights broke out between me and my friends, which made me just hate Spore all the more. But at the same time, I loved it. When my friends would leave, I'd have Spore all to myself, and I'd play it constantly until another friend comes over and the cycle repeats. Sadly, I eventually lost my Spore CD, and for the longest time, I was at peace with my friends. We would actually do things together.That is, until, Spore went on sale a few weeks ago. I remembered loving that game, so I bought it again, hoping my friends forgot about it. I logged into my old Spore account, and surely enough, everything was still there. It was all coming back to me; I couldn't help but shed a tear when I saw my old creations, my childhood. I was a little irritated when playing my old adventures since I was terrible at making them, not to mention I was terrible at spelling, but I saw it more as a joke than something to be embarrassed about. After looking over some old creations, I started a new game on the story mode, and I was instantly hooked again.And eventually, my friends got hooked again. They saw me playing it, they started playing it again, and I even have some new friends hooked to it. I thought the cycle stopped when I lost the Spore disc, but a cycle can never stop, it always repeats. As of this week, I got into a small argument with my friend over how we should do something else other than Spore, which made me realize this whole thing is getting worse. But at the same time, Spore is more fun than ever. It's the best game ever, it's the worst game ever.But enough of what I believe makes it so great. From a non-personal standpoint, this game's still something to be enjoyed. The story mode has five stages to it, and each one is unique, which gives it a fresh experience. Each stage is fairly short, but replayable. Not to mention, a bigger variety of choices opens up when you chose to be friendly, neutral, or aggressive in each stage. It changes not only the way you play and the abilities you're given, but also what other think of you, so planning out your choices is necessary. Plus, the fact that you create the creature you play as is really cool. All of the possibilities makes each time you play story mode seem like a unique experience. Outside of creatures, you can also build vehicles, houses, and my favorite, adventures. Playing the adventures was a huge part of my experience playing Spore, and making them was just as fun.It's pretty hard to look at Spore from a critical standpoint, because for me, there's not too much to say outside of the fact that what it does is really fun. It defined my childhood, and because of that, I've chosen to give it two different reviews: my own personal review, and a review from a critical standpoint.From a critical standpoint, I would give Spore a 9 out of 10, and I would recommend it to anyone who's a fan of games that offer a creative, unique experience.However, from a personal standpoint, I would give Spore a perfect 10 out of 10. I just hold it too close to my heart, and I've played it way too much to think it's not perfect.			"

												Spore definately is a great load of fun and has been for a long while for me. I have the Galactic Edition bought from back in the days and I still have it, yet in order to get hold of Galactic Adventures, I had purchased the whole bundle at one point when it was on sale at a rather good and cheap price and still to this day, I love it.I have heard of people saying about EA no longer looking into this game or updating or whatnot and if this is true, then it truly is a shame; to abandon a game of such great fun that people - even to this day - like to play and enjoy playing. What point is there abandoning this? Because it doesn´t profit you enough? Then think about fixing it, though that will likely never happen.Still, I do recommend the game. It´s fun regardless, but it´d be more enjoyable if it was fixed.			"

												This game...well...how can you not like it? It has anything you could ever dream up and anything is possible. In galactic adventures you can make your own story and do whatever it is you want in it. Also when you choose a sporecast you can use some of the items for making adventures and it's super fun, although there is no gain from the adventures that players make, they are still fun to complete so ANYTHING is possible. In other words, It's well worth getting ths game.			"

												You guys know spore. The game where you have to create a creature then evolve it to get the the space stage and become the ruler of the galexy or something. Well that game get more awesome with this Galactic Adventures DLC. In the Sapce stage, you can beam yourself down onto a planet and do cool adventures. There are also cool new outfits and weapons. And one of the best parts of all, you can create your own adventures and share them to the public for people to play! This DLC is really fun and cool so buy it or you will die from an unknown cause. >:) So have fun with getting this thing.			"

The soldiers that are supposed to back me up start shooting at an object that can't be destroyed (the mob spawn). With 30 HP left I run back to get a health kit and they run in front of me for the mobs with giant lasers to shoot me to death. Try it again and again for a full hour but can't win. Finally destroy the pod but the guy I'm supposed to talk to afterwards dies.19237432/10 would watch idiots shoot at a wall again.			"

												A beautiful concept with a slight grasp of science and evolution. The base game is already amazing. You can be a peaceful microbe, eating plant molecules, or a carnivorous cell, eating the flesh of other cells. Or, you can be both. Then, you progress into the creature stage, which is arguably, the best stage. You can start a pack or herd, whether inter species or same species is up to you. The tribal stage is up next, where you build up your societies assets and behavior. And then you go onto space. You can forge an intergalactic alliance, whether being a terror or a symbol of hope is up to you. You can set trade routes, giving you acess to recourses you wouldn't find ordinarily. You can create your own planets and creatures, and eventually, become god.And then there is the galactic adventure stage. Create your own super soldier. Make your own adventures, or play others. Create a functioning ecosystem.The universe is at your command.What will you do with it?			"

												An oldy, but a goody as the saying goes. If all the YouTubers playing it hasn't spoken for this game already, then I guess I will.Spore is a game where you evolve your creature into sentience, where you can explore the galaxy. Galactic Adventures expands onto the space age, adding things like quests and a way to make your captains stronger. It's really a lot of fun, and you can go on it forever. I'm at a hundred hours and I'm about to put some more in right now. The graphics are still fairly good, even by today's standards. There are a few problems with it and bugs with it. If your going to play, be aware of this: Don't make your creature too complex because you need space to add gear to your captain. After a while it does get sort of old, and my mouse wheel makes noises now after all the scrolling, but it's worth it to get to the center of the galaxy.			"

												This expansion pack adds the amazing adventure creation tool, with which you can create your own completely unique adventures, levels, stages, scenarious, whatever you want to call them. The options are literally endless. You can create completely unique worlds, buildings, creatures, storylines and much more. As long as you are imagining something similar to the Creature Stage in the base game: Spore, your imagination is the limit here. And if you're wondering about the community left for this game, it mostly survies by young kids who happen to buy the game or die-hard fans who still make content. If you do happen to make an adventure and upload it to their site, expect around 7 people to play it in the course of 2 years. And definetly do not expect any comments or feedback on it.			"

												A beautiful concept with a slight grasp of science and evolution. The base game is already amazing. You can be a peaceful microbe, eating plant molecules, or a carnivorous cell, eating the flesh of other cells. Or, you can be both. Then, you progress into the creature stage, which is arguably, the best stage. You can start a pack or herd, whether inter species or same species is up to you. The tribal stage is up next, where you build up your societies assets and behavior. And then you go onto space. You can forge an intergalactic alliance, whether being a terror or a symbol of hope is up to you. You can set trade routes, giving you acess to recourses you wouldn't find ordinarily. You can create your own planets and creatures, and eventually, become god.And then there is the galactic adventure stage. Create your own super soldier. Make your own adventures, or play others. Create a functioning ecosystem.The universe is at your command.What will you do with it?			"

												This is a pretty impressive game. And surprisngly enough, with this DLC my normal spore has stopped crashing. All thanks to opening up this version of the game so far. Improving the length of time I can play as well. Had fun creating landsharks, bird frogs, and just plain old birdies to fly around with and see the would. A bit annoyed that I keep coming across the same adventures on the actual DLC when I speak to my allies in the game. But apart from that I'm loving the game and the creativity that has gone into it. Graphics aren't the best and their is some glitches that happen in the game that result in you needing to restart a lot of things tha you were doing. Less of a breaking game and more of a reload problem. Overall gameplay I'd give it a 9/10. But if you're someone that plays games for graphics and details then something more out of 7/10 would be for you.Its a great game either way. And if its on a sale its a must buy!			"

It is a real shame that EA shuns this game and it's community because the last remaining people of the once thriving game community are still there and still producing amazing things. I wish EA would come back to this and make a sequel (not Darkspore, which got rid of everyone's favorite features)  or at least some DLC...			"

And one of the best parts of all, you can create your own adventures and share them to the public for people to play! This DLC is really fun and cool so buy it or you will die from an unknown cause. >:) So have fun with getting this thing.			"

												Despite the fact that it could have been much more, I do appreciate what SPORE has to offer, especially in the late game stages with the galactic adventures expansion pack. The Graphics in this game are okay, especially considering it's age and will run just fine on any decent PC these days with no problem even at higher settings. It offers a unique style of gameplay in a fashion which I actually haven't seen any other game try, what I'd really like to see is a reattempt at this game even if it's under a completely new IP by an entirely different company. I think if the potential of this game got met somehow, then we'd have a timeless game on our hands, however, due to the pandering to younger audiences and general dumbing down though, it feels pretty dull on some levels. But, I would still reccomend this to someone looking for something different even if it is watered down.			"

												The Game had potential. EA games made sure ot put that down, though.It's still a game I recomend due to what it can do. It once had tons of fan sites, but most of them if not all, have fell away. Other then that, this is not the Spore we were shown by Will Wright back in the day.			"

												Spore Galactic Adventures is Spore's expansion pack. If you've played Spore, then you would know that you evolved on a homeworld to a space faring empire. This expansion adds more to the space stage. It let's you beam down to planets and do missions on the surface of them. You can gain experience and earn new items. There are 32 items you can unlock. Galactic Adventures does not only have a space stage add on, it has it's own editors. There are two new editors, the captain editor and advenure editor. The captain editor is an outfitter similer to the others. You can put newly unlocked gear on your captain. Each item has a unique ability that is useful when you're doing adventures on planets. The adventure editor lets you create your own adventure. This powerful tool can let you create you own game. You could recreate the Hunger Games or Star Wars. You could even create something new like a castle attack or something. Creativity is the limit. When you finish your adventure, you can publish it so others can see and play it. This add on is very enjoyable, though it has a few bugs, they're nothing that can ruin your experience. I would recomend you get this if you don't have it. You would not be dissapointed.			"

												I can't figure this game out. It's supposed to be super easy to figure out and have a really user-friendly interface for making your own levels, but it just leaves a ton to be desired. The missions seem half-baked, as if this game was never intended to have such mechanics in it. I say just stick with the original Spore. I'd have more fun just making up weird creatures (even campaign aside) than trying to figure this game out.			"

But just a warning, don't buy just plain spore, fork out some cash to buy all three, install all three, and play galactic adventures version, its the only way to get the fullest of the game.

												Pretty much essential if you plan on playing Spore, I found the space stage to be the most lackluster of the game. It has plenty of content, sure, but... what's the point? It's incredibly repetitive and easily very boring. It's a shame what this could've been if Maxis hadn't ruined their community with their stupid Maxis account bullcrap, but it was fun with the planets that came with the game, regardless. 7/10, worth it and hugely upgrades your playing experience throughout the entire space stage, but not used to its full potential.

												EA schould have ivested in spore instead of the sims, the only bad side of the game is that EAs servers cant host accounts and theirfor you cant acces online funktions.Spore is great game! It basicly lets you design your werry own galaxy. You can see your creations grow from a one celled blobb to eventually become a mighty space captain that concures stars. Its defenetly one of the best games ever. 10/10 (wish I could give more than 100% on this one)(Why did EA abandon this game? Did they think: ""What do players want? To design a huose hold or the entire galaxy? hmmm... Nah... I think they prefer to just design one house, downgrade of The Sims 2 and calle it The Sims 3""(not a real quote)? Or did they just think of what would earn them most money for least effort? Brobably the later)			"

												May be scientifically innacurate regarding evolution theory, but being able to play and evolve a creature on the path to space is very enjoyable. Starting out as a microscopic organism and evolving your way towards intelligence, all the while developing your species the way you want: an insect, a bird, a reptile, or a totally bizarre hybrid of 2 or more different animal types, say, a giant spider-like creature with a shark mouth and bird wings.Although the gameplay may not be very spectacular, being able to create almost any creature, building, vehicle, and spaceship your mind can possibly conceive is the truly greatest part of Spore. Spore's online functions no longer work, But i personally think it's much better to play Spore without downloading User Generated Content. Especially since default/Maxis creations often always look so much better than user made content, which a great majority are usually just a random mess of parts, horrible-looking/poorly-made creatures, giant♥♥♥♥♥♥♥monsters, creatures with massively oversized (and sometimes spikey) genitalia, or OP creatures with all possible stats at maximum.

												Pretty much essential if you plan on playing Spore, I found the space stage to be the most lackluster of the game. It has plenty of content, sure, but... what's the point? It's incredibly repetitive and easily very boring. It's a shame what this could've been if Maxis hadn't ruined their community with their stupid Maxis account bullcrap, but it was fun with the planets that came with the game, regardless. 7/10, worth it and hugely upgrades your playing experience throughout the entire space stage, but not used to its full potential.

												The DLC expansion for Spore gives us many more pieces to add to our creature and their vehicles/houses. It's a great add-on worth what you're paying if you pit enough time into the game. If you don't play the game a lot, don't waste your time, because it'll be a waste of money.			"

												I can't figure this game out. It's supposed to be super easy to figure out and have a really user-friendly interface for making your own levels, but it just leaves a ton to be desired. The missions seem half-baked, as if this game was never intended to have such mechanics in it. I say just stick with the original Spore. I'd have more fun just making up weird creatures (even campaign aside) than trying to figure this game out.			"

												Spore Galactic Adventures is Spore's expansion pack. If you've played Spore, then you would know that you evolved on a homeworld to a space faring empire. This expansion adds more to the space stage. It let's you beam down to planets and do missions on the surface of them. You can gain experience and earn new items. There are 32 items you can unlock. Galactic Adventures does not only have a space stage add on, it has it's own editors. There are two new editors, the captain editor and advenure editor. The captain editor is an outfitter similer to the others. You can put newly unlocked gear on your captain. Each item has a unique ability that is useful when you're doing adventures on planets. The adventure editor lets you create your own adventure. This powerful tool can let you create you own game. You could recreate the Hunger Games or Star Wars. You could even create something new like a castle attack or something. Creativity is the limit. When you finish your adventure, you can publish it so others can see and play it. This add on is very enjoyable, though it has a few bugs, they're nothing that can ruin your experience. I would recomend you get this if you don't have it. You would not be dissapointed.			"

												EA schould have ivested in spore instead of the sims, the only bad side of the game is that EAs servers cant host accounts and theirfor you cant acces online funktions.Spore is great game! It basicly lets you design your werry own galaxy. You can see your creations grow from a one celled blobb to eventually become a mighty space captain that concures stars. Its defenetly one of the best games ever. 10/10 (wish I could give more than 100% on this one)(Why did EA abandon this game? Did they think: ""What do players want? To design a huose hold or the entire galaxy? hmmm... Nah... I think they prefer to just design one house, downgrade of The Sims 2 and calle it The Sims 3""(not a real quote)? Or did they just think of what would earn them most money for least effort? Brobably the later)			"

(Spore's orginal ones went offline a while ago)Some serious reward for completeing the game (Like maybe you can go into a god mode IDK)Allowing more interactions with species that are in diffrent stages of devlopment ( I.E Space to Civ or farther)Allowing us to be abducted in the Creature stageMultiplayer, (It would be cool to be in the creature stage and all the sudden your at the mercy of a Empire capable of using planet busters) I can't think of anything else for now.Oh and Something funny....

												May be scientifically innacurate regarding evolution theory, but being able to play and evolve a creature on the path to space is very enjoyable. Starting out as a microscopic organism and evolving your way towards intelligence, all the while developing your species the way you want: an insect, a bird, a reptile, or a totally bizarre hybrid of 2 or more different animal types, say, a giant spider-like creature with a shark mouth and bird wings.Although the gameplay may not be very spectacular, being able to create almost any creature, building, vehicle, and spaceship your mind can possibly conceive is the truly greatest part of Spore. Spore's online functions no longer work, But i personally think it's much better to play Spore without downloading User Generated Content. Especially since default/Maxis creations often always look so much better than user made content, which a great majority are usually just a random mess of parts, horrible-looking/poorly-made creatures, giant♥♥♥♥♥♥♥monsters, creatures with massively oversized (and sometimes spikey) genitalia, or OP creatures with all possible stats at maximum.

 1. My Opinion  I really love this game, in fact, I've been playing spore ever since it came out! When Galactic adventures came out, I was really excited to see what its all about. I've only had it for about 3 days and  I have 22.8 hours. Which I think shows how addicting this game is.  2. The good stuff about it (Still My Opinion)  What I really love about this game is that you can create a creature that has endless oppurtunities! There are some codes you can type in by doing ctrl + L. Shift + C and then type in a code such as adddna (which adds dna/money, of course) and freedom (only works in creature creator outside of world) 2.1. This Add on With the Galactic Adventure Add on it really adds a lot, it adds a new captain creator (where you add accesories to your creature/captain.) What I was amazed by is the Adventure Creator. Basically what the Adventure Creator is, it's a creator where you make a world by landscaping it, terraforming it, and adding trees and stuff (And boy do these trees make you feel like your on an alien planet with a drug trip.) and then later you put creatures from Maxis, the internet, or your own on the world with houses or whatever, basically you can do what ever you want in the Adventure Creator. 3. The not so good stuff /glitchesSome of the bad stuff about this game, well, aren't actually that bad, except one. If you complete the cell stage (the first stage) you go into the creature stage, but the problem is, when your on the galaxy and you want to start at, well, the creature stage or tribal stage, it doesn't work. What im saying is it will say ""Must complete cell stage"" or _____ stage, even when you have completed that stage, I dont know if thats just my game or whatever. Now on to the other bad thing (This is only if you have a Spore account.) If you click ""Keep me signed in"" it will keep you signed in... For that session, and so the  next time you play Spore, it logs you out. I may just be lazy but it would be nice if it would actually keep you logged in. 4. my opinion... again Your probably tired of reading my grammatically incorrect, misspelled review, but this is the end of it. But I think that the Galactic Adventures pack really does make Spore a lot more fun. It gives the game a lot more story and fun stuff to do. But one thing I do wish, is that they add more Maxis made galactic adventure levels. Currently there is only about 6 levels, and if you don't have a Spore Account, thats the only Galactic adventures levels your gonna get. 5. The end, again I have a mixed review about this, but im gonna give it a 9/10 and a yes to recommending this game, and literally only because i've played this game in my childhood and am obsessed with this game.Bye!
