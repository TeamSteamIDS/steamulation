												UPDATE: I feel I need to update this review. Capcom has finally decided to fix the problem after 2 years. I played and completed the game. It was average. :( I will leave my original review up because it was part of my gaming experience and no gamer should have to go through so many hoops just to play a game they bought. 0/10Overview: Third Person ShooterOk here we go, I can't wait to play this....*installing directx* No worries standard procedure *installing Physx*No problem, *You must restart the computer for the patch to take effect*Ok, I understand how this works, *restarts*OK NOW FINALLY, let's get started, I'm so excited*This software must be authenticated online prior to use. For activation a valid SERIAL and an active Internet connection is required. Please visit our support homepage for additional information: https://support.securom.com/PAunlock/?c=3000*What the...... Um..alright....  *clicks ok**Please enter your SERIAL in the supplied text area and press ACTIVATE to unlock. This will connect to the license server via the Internet and request an unlock license. Press CANCEL to abort.**Enters serial key*, I'm sure everything is in order, can't have just anybody playing the game, got to make sure those pesky pirates don't steal....* Activation process has been terminated  The SERIAL was not found in the database. Most likely the SERIAL has been entered incorrectly.  Press BACK to retry activating (please verify the correct input of the SERIAL) or press CANCEL to abort.  If the problem persists, please visit our support homepage for possible solutions: https://support.securom.com/PAunlock/?c=1200*What the ♥♥♥♥ is this?  Ok so I'll just check for a solution online...here we go...In order to get the game to work:A) Create a support ticket http://shop.capcom.com/store/capcomus/Content/pbPage.CapcomSupport2B) Provide them with your key and proof of purchaseC) WaitD) Wait moreE) Wait for confirmation that they key has been added, and launch the game.ConclusionI don't care if this game is the best videogame ever made in existence, in order to get it to work, you have to contact either capcom and/or securom  and provide proof of purchase to get a valid serial key.  This is just pathetic, Valve should remove this game or capcom should actually fix the problem.  Just to be clear, I am not the only one having this problem judging from all the reviews and the discussions on the forums. If you buy this piece of crap you do so at your own risk.			"

												-----------------Heads up before review---------------------------------------------------------- This game has an issue with Securerom where if you buy it, and try to activate it will show you ""activation failed"" and deemed your cd-key invalid, claiming it is not in their databases.  That is because, it isn't.  You have to contact Capcom and give them a screenshot of the cdkey, and proof of purchase (A screenshot of the email steam sends when the game is bought).   After doing this, you wait a day or two and try to install it again and everything should work beautifully.  If you went to Capcom, and nothing happens, try again, over and over until it does.  It took me 3 tries but finally got the game to install.  Below are the instructions to get your copy working if you run into the invalid cd-key issue.1) Go to http://shop.capcom.com/store/capcomus/html/pbPage.capcom-support 2) Click on the ""Contact Us"" button under the search bar. 3) Explain your issue, something like ""bought Dark Void, trying to install got invalid cdkey, etc""4) Provide screenshots of your cd-key, and proof of purchase. 5)  Wait.  If for some reason this method doesn't work, repeat until it does.  Steam support can't/won't help you and the whole secure-rom team is probably crying in a room cause everyone hates them, so no point in trying to make contact for help.---------------------------------------Review---------------------------------------------------Well I spent almost 8 hours playing this game, 3 which were spent trying to install it over and over due to the cd key issue.   I don't feel like wasting more time on this so my review is short and to the point.Graphics 8/10 It looks good for a game of 2010 (I am old, so it's weird to say it that way, but yah, for it's time the game holds up quite well)Gameplay 2/10You'll play the first level and that's basically it, no other elements are added to the gameplay maybe 2 or 3 different weapons and the upgrades for them and the jetpack.  Overall the game is SUPER repetitive, making this game boring as hell.   All the missions are the same ""oh no, enemies, shoot them please""  once the enemies are gone, that's it.   Some levels have you running around for no reason only to trigger a ""oh no, enemies again"".   If you enjoy repetitive gameplay, go for it, this game is for you, but you can just watch a video of youtube in loop, hold any sort of gamepad and try to play along like a child who is being tricked by his/her parents so they can go bone in peace. You'll save the money and won't feel as stupid as I do right now. I played this game in the hardest difficulty by the way, and it was as hard as throwing a rock into a lake.  So maybe sucking at games will raise the challenge for you.  The last boss is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Seriously.  I don't like to use the word ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at all, and I am sorry for the last boss's relatives, but it was very disappointing, lame and just overall stupid.Sound/Music 3/10Umm... nothing memorable, just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ background music.  Noticeable enough that you don't hear the sound of a piece of your soul dying while playing this game past lvl 1 and forgettable enough that you can actually sleep at night after the feeling of emptiness leaves your body before bed.Story  3/10  I was going to give it a 1, but that's mean, and I've been mean enough already.   The story is bad, just full of holes and the character development is nonexistent.  The characters have names that you won't care about, there's a cameo of a cool scientist for like 2 mins total, and even then, they don't managed to properly include him in the overall development of the story.    I feel they hired dead fish to write this story, but since fish can't hold pencils or pens, they had to just wing it and interpret the smell of slimy scales under the sun into a filler story to get this game out there and ready to sell.  If only they had hired a child capable of mumbling words this game would be entertaining enough to follow along till the end.Replay value -1000/10When you finish they game they give you an unlocked radar to find all the hidden treasures...  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  omg.  Nice one guys.  That is the best April fools joke ever.Overall - 3/10  This is not an average at all, I just felt like 3 is a nice number.  ♥♥♥♥♥♥ enough to be under 5 but good enough to be above 2.  At first I had the ""don't buy this game cause you can't install it"" review, but now I edited to say, don't buy this game cause it will make you dumb.   I mean it is entertaining for like 20 mins, so if you are ok with that, go for it.  If not, please heed my advice: Go outside and pick up a rock, throw it in any direction as far as you can, then close your eyes, count to 10 and go look for the rock.  You'll have a lot of more fun than playing this crap, you'll play outside, you'll get some sunlight tan and who knows, you might hit a leprechaun or something and find some gold.  If the price of this game is $3.00 or less, buy it.  I like to collect games, so why not.  If you paid more than that, you are officially a sucker, like me.  Hey,at least you are not alone.			"

												I wish i could write a review, but this game as additional copy protection which does not allow the game to be activated so I can not play.Message 1 from meGood morning,I bought Darkvoid on Steam but ran into a problem as many other gamers on Steam:http://steamcommunity.com/app/45710see below screenshot for more detailed information.could you please send me an unlock codeI thank you in advanceMessage 2 from Capcom:Thank you for contacting us. We are sorry to hear that your key is not working in Steam. Please mail us a photo of your key, confirm in writing what you are entering as code and a photo of the proof of purchase of the game, thank you. Message 3 from me:Good Day,Thank you for your mail. Usually I stay (or try to stay) polite but due to the fact this is a problem which is going on for over a long period of time and involves many of my fellow gamers thus this writing.Concerning the following : We are sorry to hear that your key is not working in SteamPlease find below links:1) More Negative than Positive reviews because of ♥♥♥♥ing up honest gamers/buyers:2) Big promise but no solution from Capcomhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/45710/discussions/0/616199736993277811/3) 11 pages of buyers screwed by Capcomhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/45710/discussions/0/613938575205537267/4) complaints ...http://blogjob.com/oneangrygamer/2014/12/dark-void-securom-drm-continues-to-give-steam-users-trouble/5) and ... more complaints ...http://www.capcom-unity.com/dark_void/go/thread/view/7501/23133617/remove-securom-from-steam-version-of-dark-void-zeroI am gaming over 30 years. I started with the commodore 16.I never ever encountered such crap as with you guys.Back at the time when I was young buying Capcom meant buying quality and a good game.Capcom means nothing anymore. You guys are a like a dinosaur clinging to the past, unable to evolve.Look at my steam accountDo you know why I have over 500 games on Steam (and the games they do not sell on Steam I buy at Uplay and Origin).Because most of the games are crap.I play for an hour or most games even less before I get frustrated.Most games just suck because publishers see only USD but not the gamer who actually has to spend USD to buy the game.Rushjobs, unfinished, uninspired quick cash but no dedication and long term view towards the future.You ♥♥♥♥ gamers/buyers they do not trust you next time.I have games which I bought 3 years ago and I have never played which is probably the case with DarkVoid.You want proof of purchase, impossible because I do not keep them in my mailbox, and I expect that if I buy something because I want to be honest I do not want to be approached like a thief and I want it to work.I can ask the helpdesk at Steam, but for 9 EUR I am not going to waste my time.I am going to downvote this game and write my review and also publish my experience in the long thread of gamers who got screwed by Capcom.This is Steam, it has already been checked.I you approach honest people with this kind of attitude, it says all about the current mentality of Capcom.Maybe put more energy in making decent games instead of crap.this is all you will get from me in order to solve your problemMessage 4 from CapcomThank you for contacting us with your feedback, we have passed it on to the relevant department. We have forwarded your request for code activation and hope to give you confirmation shortly. Still waiting ....			"

Capcom put a broken game on Steam and is taking no responciblity, saying that ""its Steeeeeeeeams fault because they are the retailer and thats how the law works"".

												I'm actually pretty upset about this game not being playable. I had a copy of it for PS3 a few years ago, and it was mildly entertaining to fly around. The story isn't great in the least bit, but it has fun aspects to it. Well due to 3rd party DRM, I can't even play the game I purchased for nostalgia. 0/10 do not buy unless you plan on throwing away money.			"

												The game is short, starts slow, and has a crummy story. Definitely not worth what it went for at release.However, the stuff that was good was actually really good (the jetpack dogfights) and I'd say that that alone justifies the dirt-cheap price it's going for now. Just be aware that you'll have to suffer some mediocrity.			"

												I wanted to like this game. After all... JETPACKS!But I couldn't get it to run. Apparently, for an unlucky (carefully kept quiet) portion of the market, the authentication server fails to update. As a result you cannot authenticate your game. A couple of hours investigation turns up that:1. Steam says it's CAPCOM's problem, because it's an authentication server issue.2. CAPCOM says it's Steam's problem, because they gave you a dodgy key.3. Two or three weeks of collecting emails, and you're now ready to open a support ticket on CAPCOM's customer support so that, another week or so later, if they feel like it, they'll get around to adding your key to the database MANUALLY.3a. Oh yeah. I'll take proof of purchase, screenshots of your steam account etc. and probably a call or three to the support line as well before they finally give you access.4. Also, the whole time you're doing the above, remember this : This is a well-known problem that numerous people have documented (most of which has been scrubbed from forums etc.). But, since it's an old game, selling for (relatively) limited amounts, they can't be bothered to patch it. They're counting on you simply giving up having wasted your money.I never got that far. I gave up at about week 2. YMMV.			"

												One of the best (and underrated) games I've ever played, however... It gets too tough after a few hours because of the QTEs (quick-time event, meaning you have to push the right keys on the keyborad just on time; yeah, I do know that's pretty stupid). But shoting and flying is very rewarding, brings loads of fun. Also note that this game is not easy, not for ""casual players""; oh, no!PROS:- interesting story- interesting characters- great action (fighting, flying)- great graphics- great physics- you vs. bad aliens from space ;)- may be difficultCONS:- too difficult sometimes...- ... especially with those stupid QTEsVERDICT:9/10If I could, I'd buy it once again!

												So, most of the negative views for this game revolve around an issue where the SecuROM DRM failed to yield an activation.That issue has since been fixed, so you can buy and play this game reliably. That aside, this game was, for me, a pleasant surprise. It satisfied an itch I've had for a shooter, but also gave me something else to yearn for in the future - seamless horizontal to vertical combat.Writing wise, the game is pretty solid. There are some thematic elements that will feel familiar - a LOST-style island, references to reptillian conspiracies, a bit of the Matrix-style Oracle-tells-Neo-To-Save-The-World kind of stuff. It's a little flat towards the end, but its engaging enough to be enjoyable.The characters themselves are simple enough - the main character (voiced by Nolan North of Uncharted fame) is the typical male super-protagonist, pilot turned badass super soldier with a jetpack. You don't get very much A.I. help, and the friendly A.I. are just barely useful. That said, they aren't really necessary for much more than that - the majority of the game you alone are enough to handle the enemy hordes while the A.I functions nicely as cannon fodder. They _do_ deal damage though, which is nice - you can't assume they can finish an enemy off, but they certainly help a bit.The enemy A.I. isn't half bad either. They make use of cover, attempt to flank, use grenades, and will use jetpacks in mid-to-late game to get around you and take a vertical position of fire. It's not the smartest A.I. in the world of gaming, but they certainly put up a decent challenge.Now, with that said, the gunplay is pretty straightforward at best - cover-based combat in the beginning isn't anything special. But you'll find you don't use it very often, because you have a BLOODY JETPACK.The jetpack transforms you into Rocketman, blasting around the landscape with mounted guns blasting the crap out of enemies. It's well balanced - in hover mode you can boost around, taking advantage of the landscape to take on enemies on lower planes of battle, or engaging mid-air enemies efficiently. Some areans allow for full-range combat, converting from hover to full jet mode. In the latter you forgo your traditional weapons for a mounted gun that does tremendous damage to ground troops and moderate damage to flying ships.The addition of vertical combat was a very welcome change. It reminded me a bit of old Unreal tournament or Tribes in a sense - being able to descend upon the enemy was a very warm and awesome feeling. Smart use of aerial maneuvers could allow the player to zip through and lay down fire like an A-10 on enemis, swap to hover mode, and rain down from the rear while what few A.I. friendlies keep up fire from the front. It *does* work rather well in the end.The maps are generally well done - many times there are areas to engage enemies vertically, as well as traditional horizontal cover-based advances. Your jetpack is given plenty of areas to be used, and this helps keep combat fluid and engaging. There are always ways for you to get an advantageous position on the enemy, even at the risk of being shot out of the sky.I do have some gripes, in the end - there is an upgrade system that feels very half done. Weapons can gain up to 3 levels of linear upgrades, as does the jetpack. But it doesn't seem like there are enough upgrade orbs in the entire game to allow for more than a few fully leveled weapons. I went with the standard human weapon and a fully upgraded jetpack in the end, because the human rifle gets explosive rounds and that seemed to last well into the endgame. I will say this - endgame opponents are serious bullet-sponges, even with upgraded gear. It got a little annoying because the upgrade tree maxes out so quickly. It was an unfortunate oversight as it would have allowed for end-game units to be challenging instead of annoying. There is a dearth of instruction in the game - you can hijack enemy aircraft, but there is (to my knowledge) no guide to figure out the mixture of pressing 'E' to rip a panel off, and A/D to dodge around. There is at least one boss battle where the prompt says 'PRESS A AND D' instead of ""PRESS A OR D"". The latter will save you, while the former will force you into re-doing a relatively time-consuming sequence.There are not a lot of quicktime events, thankfully, but the ones that are there do not feel very challenging or engaging. I feel that if you are going to have QTE for boss/miniboss sequences, make it something a little more involved - the final boss QTE is very underwhelming. It is, in the end, a rather short game - expect to beat it in a sitting. I did it in about 7 hours on normal - I think hard would only yield another hour of gameplay at best. There are collectibles that may extend the gameplay experience - new game + allows them to pop up on your radar so you'll find them a bit easier (which, given the often extensive maps to fight on, its easy to miss them). Unfortunately CAPCOM didn't take the opportunity to really expand on a world that could have dived much, much deeper. I would say this title is worth it on sale for a Saturday worth of blasting lizard-robot alien scum and saving the world.			"

												This is going to be a quick 2 part review.  First on the game, second on the DRM.Firstly, the game is an okay Sci-fi FPS.  There are two distinct modes in the game, the FPS part and the flying/shooter part.  I perferred the FPS to the Shooter part as the flying is a little clunky in the controlls department.  Aswell the flying shooter part also felt lackluster as there was a very limited enemy pool and the enviroments were a little dull.The FPS was actually not bad, it was a typical cover based shooter.  However the cover mechanic was pretty decent as there was parts in the game where you had to scale or descend and the cover mechanic was used quite well in those as well.  In particular the end of the first chapter/mission had a real fun use of the scaling cover.  There is a lack of weapon variety in the game but you can upgrade your weapons to change them up slightly as well and at the beginning of each chapter/part you can switch up your weapons and there are weapon chests in the levels were you can do the same.Story was okay, not specatular, it was a little predictable, but still a interesting enough that you are interested in the story.  As well there is lore hidden about in levels to add to the story if you so choose to read it.Graphics were good and really enjoyed some of the level design, first level/area in particular.Alright, on to the second part, the DRM.  The DRM for this game is terrible to be fair.  When you buy/install/launch the game you won't be able to.  For some reason the Steam Keys don't end up in the third party DRMs (securcom? I think).  Anyways, the process sucks and takes some time but the game does work in the end.  Here is the proces I followd:1.) Launch game -> doesn't work even using Securcom directions2.) Contact Securcom, provide them with screen shots of steam key, they will reply it's not in their database and to contact Capcom support.3.) Contact Capcom support and provide them with screen shot of steam purchase hisotry showing purchase as well as screen shot of steam key.4.) Capcom support will email back that the key has been added to database.5.) Launch game.That process is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and is not needed, especially on such an old game and if you have a stance on DRM, don't buy this game.  For me, the DRM process was stupid, but the game does work and it was an enjoyable game for me so I give it a very hesitant recommendation.  I recommend the actual game, I DO NOT recommend the crappy DRM that comes with it.			"

												Ever watched ""The Rocketeer""?Was a fictional 1991 movie with a guy flying with a jetpack on his back. Maybe the first most realistic implementation of the idea ever made.Well this game was a complete inspiration of this concept. And it was sweet. But with a really messed up ending.So here's the thing, you got a cool action game with lots of potential and very nice story telling almost as if it came out of a good Disney scifi movie (EXCEPT THE ENDING).The voice acting was ok, and the graphics seemed also cool for a 2010 game.Sweet environments and awesome gameplay including exploration and action on foot, while hovering and while flying.Small but cool number of weapons to use, covering system omg yes, nice animations and models and decent maps to go through.All well and cool and a story that looks intriguing up to a point. But if you like GOOD stories that are being WELL told.... you'll get a bad surprise..The ending is so freakin dmn ♥♥♥♥ing LAME that it will make you stare at the ending credits with a serious WTF expression in yoru face wondering why you spent your time playing the whole thing at the first place.If you like a good relaxing acton shooting game, then you will have np spending your time with it.But if you appreciate good story and get mad when people ♥♥♥♥ the story up for you... Then you might not really enjoy the way this game ends.For the 1,24 bucks spent to get this on this holiday special offers, this is a great deal.But once you come to think that this title was once sold for full price and people actually bought it.... My god I feel sorry for them...______[Warning; Big Spoilers ahead after this point - angry rant following]_______What's the deal with companies getting to be so damn ♥♥♥♥ing lazy in some games?I mean, ok, you get your♥♥♥♥♥down to gather developers, modelists, music composers, voice actors to get a job well done, and your script writer is like what, a ♥♥♥♥ing 10 year old?Seriously this game could had been something really extraordinary enough to compete the top games of fictional story franchises ever.And right at the ending, they completelly ♥♥♥♥ up the whole romance background between the main character and his (ex) /girlfriend/After a huge♥♥♥♥♥final boss battle.. ~omg how freaking original right? - but ok let's say that this is an action shooter, It's understandable up to a point.But anyway after the final boss battle, you, the chosen one, who are supposed to save the parallel universe world from the evil machines who enslaved humans, you get to kill and destroy all the means the alien machines ever tried to use to oppress the humans of that world.While at it, all remaining humans build a huge♥♥♥♥♥freakin Ark that you have to keep fighting to keep it alive through hords and hords of enemies in order to get them to the portal to the real world [40s WW2 real life]And just about before the big final, the prophet tells you that only YOU can go through the portal after revealing that you are the chosen one.So instead of staying back helping all those people you dragged along just to acompany your sorry♥♥♥♥♥fighting in the sky on your way to the portalinstead of staying by teh side of the love of your lifeinstead of having the least amount of interest anyone could have had to explore a vast uncharted new worldThe main character crosses the port. ALONE! Like not giving a single ♥♥♥♥ about anything that happened during the whole ♥♥♥♥ing game.And that's not even the worst thing.Right at the end of the boss fight, on the top of the highest and sharpest ♥♥♥♥ing peak ever existing in teh horizon.After landing with your girlfriend right at the portal.A bad guy appears out of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere, without a ship, without ♥♥♥♥ing stairs to lead him up there, just spawns and stabs your gf!!And even after that WTF-JUST-HAPPENED scene, does the main character take his gf back to the ark to have her aided? NODoes he at least stay by her side to hold her hand on her final moment? NO.He just crosses the portal, not giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥about his slowly dying gf and just sits watching her die with a sorry♥♥♥♥♥expression on his face.Why the hell would you even take us through the whole romance story of the main character reuniting with his ex, actually bond all over again, reveal their background and have them fall in love all over again just to kill the girl and have the dude walk away like that without a kiss goodbye?Where the ♥♥♥♥ did you take the script from? A ♥♥♥♥ing japanese manga for teenagers?And as if all this didn't blow my mind well enough, you get to see a cinematic at the end.Your main character sits by the side of river Thames thinking about that girl, then out of nowhere a guy who was a secondary character and a person who lived inside the parallel universe world, appears next to you wearing a suit and tells you ""come on, there's much t be done""......wait.. wasn't the main character the ONLY one who was able to cross the portal...?...........WHAT.THE.ACTUAL.♥♥♥♥.DUDE?!?!??!????!?!??!?!?

												So, I felt like I have to write a review to compensate a bit the negativity this games got. The negativity mainly came from an issue with not the game, but its sh|tty, unnecessary and annoying drm, securom. Yeah, there is that, you cant do anything about it, but the point is, the issue with securom has been fixed. A long time ago. So, if youre planning to grab this thing and browsing the reviews just ignore those complaining about ""friggin serial not activating..."", its history.The other source of complains is the controls. Well, I play my games with a generic 3-button mouse and a generic keyboard, but I couldnt find any wrong with it, set my sensitivities and I was ready to go (saying this I dont dig games involving flying at all, apart from this one ofcourse). Idk about gamepad controls though, but I dont rly care, were pc gamers, gamepads are for consoles, kids, and maybe sport games anyway.About the game, yeah, it needs some love, but if you can get through the hiccups (Im detailing them below), its serious fun. Jetpax, man! With guns! And with flying, hoovering and jet-jumping along comes an interesting vertical cover system, flanking, b|tchslapping enemies from behind, from above... Fun times. While there are only 6 weapons in the game (besides your trusty jetpack artillery, what will be your main armament anyway) they are fun and unique, you can also upgrade them as you progress.Now about the afromentioned hiccups:- No full screen option: Alt+Enter when the game fired up ONCE, it will start in full screen every time thereafter- Cant skip intro vids: rename, move or delete the contents of ""\Dark Void\nativePC\SkyGame\Movies"" folder- Crash on falling rocks when first time picking up a weapon/at the falling boat after picking up the spare parts (both in chapter 1): this is an issue with ATI cards bc of the forced Physx driver usage afaik, locking the framerate to 30 for these two events helped me to pass them easily (you have to restart the game to take effect!)Played the game on both XP and Win7, but I didnt run into any other problems. These looks a lot? Maybe, for some. If you find these too much to tinker with, skip this piece. Or play it on consoles. But in the end we play our games on pc, were familiar with this kind of stuff, and at least we have the opportunity to tinker around.TL;DR:Fun game if you dont get cold of some tinkering, and since the securom issue fixed, defo worths the €2 this thing goes down to during almost every sale. Get it if youre into jetpacks, guns, or jetpacks with guns! Or just want a cheap trip into The Bermuda Triangle. "

												I LOVE THIS GAME!But there's also some very obvious flaws. Before I go into how much I love this game, let me tell you about how many areas need improvement: - Controls are very confusing (at first) - Flopsy combat system which bi-polarly interchanges from great to awful throughout - Flight needs some serious fine tuningNow let me unfold the awesomeness of this game - RELENTLESS ACTION - EPIC SOUNDTRACK - LAUGHABLY CHEESY PLOT - LAUGHABLY CHEESY CHARACTERS - UNDENYABLY FUN COMBAT SYSTEM, FLOPINESS INCLUDED!Everything cheesy about this game, is a GOOD kind of cheesy. Reminded of Uncharted voice acting. It's very realistic and engages the character, but at the same time just makes you laugh at how the characters react to the situations at hand.It's like B movie.People seem to dislike this game, and their complaints seem to be what make it really fun to me. Goofy animations, cheesy everything, just above bad ragdoll physics. It might be just me but these things make me want to play the game so much more. I honestly think this game was released as it was on purpose. Capcom didn't want to make something serious, but they also wanted to keep it engaging and fun, and that's exactly what Dark Void is. Engaging, and fun.Since I can't really release a review (without hating myself later) and say nothing about the plot, so basically; you crash land on an island, you encounter weird robot alien tech-like things you don't know about, you fight them, you survive the island and it's elements. It's quite forgettable, but in all seriousness, it more than gets the job done.IT'S UNCHARTED WITH ALIEN-LIKE ROBOTS! SCIENCE, ♥♥♥♥♥!8/10 = Being a very personal review, I'm sure many of you disagree.			"

												Dark Void isn't a must-play game. It's somewhat buggy, it crashes from time to time, there's not a huge amount of weapon or enemy variety, and there are certain parts of the game that are pretty boring. It also has a Securom online activation that was broken for almost a year, and even though Capcom has now reached out to them and fixed it there's always the possibility of it happening again. But it's one of those games like Dark Sector where while at heart they're just third person shooters, they have unique concepts that I haven't seen anywhere else and do them just well enough to be worth trying. In this case, the concept is the jet pack, which gives the game more verticality than most cover shooters have. The controls for flying it take a bit of getting used to at first, but once you do it's a lot of fun playing in the areas where you're free to fly around. There's a disappointingly high amount of missions that mostly involve confined spaceship interiors where there isn't much room for the mechanic to shine, but there are just enough missions that are great to make up for them. The story is also somewhat interesting, though the concept is more interesting than the actual execution of it and the main characters are just bland enough to feel like they don't really deserve to be in a story concept that neat, and the side characters that you actually want to hear more from usually get benched. The game goes on sale for around $2 pretty often (I got it for $2 from the Green Man Gaming summer sale), so it's probably better to wait for one of those times since it isn't exactly an ""you should urgently play this game right now""-good game, but it's certainly worth trying for the sake of playing the good parts. Dark Void isn't the best third person shooter you'll ever play, but chances are it's not the worst, either.			"

												Don't get me wrong the game is fun for what it is but the whole thing feels rushed to release.The numerous amounts of bugs and errors I've encountered from the get go indicates the type of game it is.The flying sections in the game are very enjoyable however the rest of the game such as gun to gun combat are almost pointless are you can simply run up to enemies and press E to one hit kill them.I wouldn't recommend this game if you're looking for a good GAME to play, however if you like the novelty of flying like I do it's something you should consider looking into.EDIT - I've recently finished the game and it feels very unfinished, the game ends suddenly with the final boss and plot of the story totally feeling cut off like they ran out of funding.

Initial impressionsThese are some of my initial impressions of the game, as well as some previous experience with the Xbox 360 version of the game.ProsIt actually started up, unlike what most of the reviews have been saying. Looks like I'm either extremely lucky or Capcom decided to get off their asses and fix it.Jetpacking is fun.Satisfying melee kills.Fairly nice visuals.ConsSecuROM.God, I hate SecuROM.Gun combat is fairly unsatisfying and largely mediocre.Forced exploration segments are unbelievably boring.Sub-par voice acting, with the exception of the protagonist (voiced by Nolan North).Note that this is not guaranteed to work for all people from what other reviews have said, so be wary. I could be one in a million, though I doubt a million people bought this game.6/10. If you're gonna try this one out, get it for cheap, just in case.			"

												A game that is under-estimated! I maxed the graphics on my GIG heavy PC, played the game on my wall through projector; WELL, the results are good! They were wanting to make a film out of this with a few HARD HITTING names interested! Let's say so much, THEY liked it - so your curiosity MAY be stoked. It is SO good! I think I would'nt be dismayed with a sequel to this game! It's 3rd person, Nikolas Tesla is in the game (hello history). The story is deep enough for more-as I said earlier a sequel is welcome from my side! How does it play? Sometimes like a blend of SNIPER ELITE V2 or/and JUST CAUSE 2, only fantastical sci-fi (aliens in jungles with air-combat from ww1 and sometimes a little bit of the feel of TOMB-RAIDER [one of her weapons-the ak-47 like rifle] )!

I'll give it a 6/10. Not a great game by anymeans, but if videogames had an equivalent to ""popcorn flicks"", this would be in that caterogry. Enjoyable if you know what you're getting into.			"

												TL;DR - This game is absolutely fantastic.  Great sci-fi story, twisted with some mythology, built through found journals and cut-screens at the beginning of each level; excellent weapon selection and upgrade system;  very smooth gameplay (with a few scattered, mildly annoying Quicktime events.)  All-around excellent game and well worth the asking price, though the summer sale is a nice bonus, which makes it a total no-brainer.  DEFINITELY BUY IT!!!------------------------------Anyway, I'm not sure why so many negative reviews (at the time of writing, only 41% of 327 reviews are positive) but I feel this game is criminally underrated here.  It current holds a 57 at Metacritic and 60.8% at GameRankings (I did not check the ratings of the console versions), which I still feel are too low.  Perhaps I'm just really easy to please but this is one of the best games I've played in the past year or so.  I will not try to make the grandiose claim that it's one of the best games ever or anything like that but I will say that it is certainly one of my favorites.Some people may be turned off by the presence of Quicktime events but, honestly, they are few and far between.  There are some brilliant cover mechanics, and the more standard run-n-gun shooter gameplay is supplemented by armed jetpack combat.  There isn't a large variety of enemies but varied environments coupled with a nice weapon selection/upgrades and very fun cover and flight mechanics ensure that the gameplay never gets stale.  There is some amount of replay value to find all of the journals and collect hidden ""tech point"" caches for weapon upgrades.If you're interested in more detail of what people like or dislike about the game, there are plenty of reviews here that have already covered it all - no need for me to rehash what others have said (likely far more eloquently than myself as well.)  If you get nothing else from my review, however, the takeaway should be that Dark Void deserves much more attention and praise than it has received.  I believe it's an excellent $10 game.  Even better if you can grab it at 80% off during the summer sale.  Believe me, you could do a lot worse with $2 on Steam.			"

												Im totaly for this game, game it self is realy deasent, ofc controls are bit sensitive especialy might seam dificult to handel flying controls at start, but its not becouse its poarly made or veigly optimized, this game demands a bit of skill from a player thats why majority rather not recomend it, story line is quite interesting in my opinion and thats another reason to love this game. Enough amount of action, a litle bit of mistery, and it got some enviromental background wich is well made. Not forcing you to buy it, but if u got the skills and enjoy roaming in skyes, nock urselfs out.			"

												Why is this game sold on Steam if you can't play it right out; why is a CD Key even necessary since it was purchased via Download; come on, Steam is a Digital Download interface, CD Keys are a pointless.  Either the DRM for this game should be removed, or the game should be removed off of Steam, simple as that.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It is unplayable without ""SecuRom"" DRM, which doesn't seem to recognize legitimately purchased keys. Unless you enjoy sending support emails and getting completely ignored, you're wasting your money. Yes, even for 1.99, THIS GAME IS A WASTE OF YOUR TIME. Wish I could tell you about the gameplay though. I'll let you know in a few weeks when all my security information is verified. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.			"

												I got this on a recent Humble Sale and had no issues activating the game with the CD key. I played and beat it when it came out on the PS3 and decided to pick it back up again on PC. The game mixes decent third person shooting with fun flying mechanics that is clearly inspired by the Rocketeer. The story is a fairly standard fare about the player ending up in another world where he has to fight alien monsters to stop them from destroying humanity. It does take some interesting bits like 1930s era visuals and having Nicola Tesla as a character but mostly you'll be flying in and out of combat, shooting alien machines.It's a pretty fun little action game with some cool ideas.

												Sad to see how low the reviews are here. I've played the non steam version some and I've played it on console so even though my playtime is low I've seen this game. The combat is pretty fun (I wish it took a few less shots to kill enemies though) the flight is also fun, and the controls feel good. That being said, I play with a controller. This game does not feel great on mouse and keyboard. The DRM is annoying just because it exists, but activation is painless. Very easy. This game only takes around 10 hours to beat, and for the $10 price tag it has (without a sale) in 2016, I think that is more than fair. The voice actors aren't bad, and the story is interesting enough to keep me playing. The graphics are pretty nice for a game of this era as well, and I'm fairly impressed with how smooth it runs even on newer hardware. It ran just as well on my GTX 330M at launch as it does now on my GTX 770. Good stuff. Now, what are the problems with this game? Well, you really only want to play it with a controller, and you might get motion sickness. Other than that, its a fun little 3'rd person romp, and its pretty cheap. Why the hell not right? -PR0XIDIAN			"

Runs a little slow on older computers, but what else can you expect?This is a good game if you want to play something like MASS effect but don't have the money for it. All in all a good game, flying with the jetpack was insanely hard if you used a game controller, and fire power was ALWAYS in the enemy's favor, but the duck/cover options more then made up for it.

												Dark void feels very rushed. its a solid premise guy gets trapped in alien dimention and has to kill robot alien things to get home. the story is the place where everything feels the most rushed. The game is very much part of the cinematic trend in gaming. this does not have to be a bad thing but then you shouldn't mess up the story. for example nicola tesla shows up and is not introduced as such. You are supposed to see it by the machinery he is around and the character designe. he also seems to give orders we kinda find out halfway through the mission. Furthermore the Interpeter and the Dweler both significant characters aren't given enought waight that they should have. i wish they could have built the world a little bit more since the alternative history take is something i always love. gameplay wise the beginning plays like a worse uncharted without the puzzels. Still the shooting and coversystem are solid. the enemies are usualy robotic aliens. but they seem to be inhabitied by these reptilian creatures (which is not gone into all that much.) Also the endboss battle can't kill you on casual that's just bad designe i know casual should be easy but come on people we aren't comatose. between these are jetpack sections that are the highlight of this game. It's just awsome to fly around and kill the alens in their aircraft. Its telling that desipite all the negativity i heaped on the game just now i wanted to play those levels again but had no reason to. given it's current price it's a trip worth taking despite everything.

												Most of the reviews for this game seem to be negative because of some sort of Steam key activation issue. Personally, I bought a copy of this game on sale a while ago and finally decided to play it on a whim with no activation issues.Pros:- The gameplay and shooting is honestly pretty run of the mill for a cover based shooter. However, the addition of verticality and jetpack combat made the game a bit more interesting. The gameply itself was also solid and only bugged out on me once where I became stuck in the wall/ground, but a simpel restart fixed it.- The graphics are solid (character models are kinda outdated) and the game runs at a nice framerateCons:- The story is kinda lame and feels as if parts have been left out. Like they just want you to assume some things.- The story just kinda ends. Like there is a set up, a quick boss fight, and that's it. Like they ran out of money towards the   end.- The boss fights and the game overall is very easy. I think I died like three time because of me doing stupid sh*t.Overall:I gotta say I had fun. The game didn't overstay its welcome, yet ended oddly quickly. Also, it appears they had a set up for a sequel, buuuuuuuut we all know that didn't pan out. I'd recommend the game on sale for like no more than $5. A dollar per hor for this game was a solid investment.6-7/10 "

												Alright...let me make one thing absolutely clear: Dark Void is a great game and an instant cult classic.Now that that's out the way, be aware that not only does this game suffer from uncooperative *DRM, but if you do manage to get it to work, you'll discover that the game is one of the worst ports ever, on the PC. Raising the resolution to anything above 720p will cause the game to freeze, and it does not run fullscreen; only windowed. No love or care was taken to ensure that this game is enjoyable on any level for PC users. On the first level my framerate eventually grind to a halt, then crashed.If you own a console like a PS3 or XBox 360, you NEED to make this game apart of your collection and I highly reccomend you get it - just not for the PC, obviously.*Side note: I managed to get the game authentication to work when I fired it up in the wee hours of the morning. I'm guessing whatever toaster is authenticating this game can only take on a small number of requests at a time. Try authenticaing the game during non-peek hours on a weekday and maybe you can avoid doing it manually though customer support.			"

												I'm not gonna lie I had some real fun with this game. Flying around with the jetpack was pretty easy and fluid, and the levels were well oriented towards the usage of the jetpack.Just some quick pros and cons:Pros:-Jet flight is fluid and fun-Story doesnt try and drag itself out (not trying to be overly deep)-Collectibles are there but not required-A little Variety with gun choice and can swap around in between levels freelyCons:-Enemies take a crap ton of shots to kill-Will most likely concentrate on the general rifle the enemies drop for upgrades, otherwise it takes forever to kill something-Some of the flying levels, while fun, can drag on for a while-Story isn't really explained, feels like they planned for a sequel that never happenedAll in all, like i said earlier, its a fun game, but i would get it on sale, not full price.7.5/10			"

Activation successful and was able to start the game. Runs without a hitch; screen resolutions can be configured without any problems. At this point i'm happy enough to recommend this game. Kudos to the developer, SecuRom, Steam users and perhaps Steam team too. Hah hah this could be a world's first usage of the term - Steam team. Definitely will be playing more of this game.

												Okay, first of all, lower you expactations a bit. It is a nice mediocre game, nothing more than that. I tell ya what... if the game was a 90's sci-fi movie, it would have done tremendously well. As for a video game... meh. The concept and the heart of the game seem to be in the right place, thing is it doesn't deliever it. The gameplay takes a lot to get used to, but once you have it can be kind of fun.I am sitting on the fence with this one. I bought it for 2 dollars on a Capcom sale and it was without even reading any review.So to be clear, if it is ever as super cheap as the price I bought it for, then sure, it describes the amount of fun in this game.anymore than that, it's on you, don't say I didn't warn ya.

												8/10This is is a MUST HAVE game. Not to complex but anything else than borring. Every Chapter, every level you get new enemies, stronger and with new abilities but this also counts for you!Easy to handle controls and great controller integration. Maybe just one downside and that is that the game is rather short and if you enjoy it as much as I do... it is just too short. Further more it has a story line and the game progress fits right into it. Good cutscenes where needed but not borring long or like qlot of ""in between game"" movies that tell a part of the game story, they come straight to the point and it is just a follow up and skippable!I started the game while testing some newly installed games, it was the fourth I tested but the first that I played for 4 hours in a row berore moving on to the next game to test!

												This game is horribly underated, sure the characters are dry and unemtional, but this game has something few other games have and that is combat freedom.I could easily sum up the pros in one sentence: Verticle, and horizontal cover based third person shooter that can turn into an aircraft battle at the push of a button.The reason it is so poorly rated is because it does have a feeling of being unfinished, like capcom started the game then abruptly had to sell what they managed to put together, which is dissapointing since it had so much potential.

												Maybe it's a great game, I will never know. The controls are so poor, I couldn't stand playing as I couldn't hit anything on the INTRO level.I mean you read reviews before buying that say the controls are poor, but you really have no idea until you experience it for yourself.Perhaps with a controller they make more sense. I don't own a controller to even try. I have over 15 years of first person shooter playing, and I couldn't stand their control scheme.Basically their intro mission puts enemies so close to you, that even while breaking your ""jetpack"" to slow down, you are stuck trying to quickly turn enough to aim at the enemies, but without over turning to aim pass them. Again, it's not like I don't know how to aim, but the way the game implements the aiming into the game.If a game developer can't even make the intro levels feel, and function smoothly, I don't trust them with my time in progressing any further in their game.

												I was actually a little surprised at how much I enjoyed this game.It has a lot of things in its favour.  The story, while not exactly the next Great American Novel, served adequately as backdrop for the action and most of the characters have enough personality without being obnoxious.  The visual style fits the concept very well, clearly influenced by the same alternate history comic the main premise is based on.  The air combat and cover based shooting mesh surprisingly well and I found switching between them to be fairly smooth and intuitive.I did read some other reviews mentioning that the air game was hard to control, however I believe this is because the game was designed to be played with a controller.  By realising that fairly early, I had no problems at all.  In fact I found that the whole air game felt particularly ""good"".  You can buzz around with your jetpack, take over enemy aircraft, hop into friendly AA turrets and seamlessly move between flying and hovering.  Note that the game doesn't really tell you to do these things though, I didn't even realise I could take over enemy ships until halfway through.  Still, it is small optional elements like this that sold the game to me.  In fact, I was impressed enough that if someone told me these developers made an open world game using the mechanics demonstrated here, I would probably throw some money its way.Naturally, it has its flaws.  Chief among which that the game is rather short and a bit random at times, most likely because the developer was more ambitious than its wallet allowed.  There are some signs of separate segments of the storyline being Frankensteined together in an attempt to keep things coherent after money ran out, but all in all this won't bother you much and I felt that a good job was done all things considered.  At least not until the very end.  There the game ran out of steam and threw in two bossfights in quick succession that obviously were only thrown in because it is what was finished.  Oh well.  Bigger titles have done the same with less excuse.Another issue I had was the placement of the checkpoints, which were not always properly spaced.  There was a defend section I had to do over a few times because I failed a quicktime event and died instantly.  Yes, the game has quicktime events.  That's another minus.  A minor saving grace there is that they are short, sometimes optional and, in the case of one particular hostile, even allow you to choose which quicktime sequence you want to do by picking between two different prompts.My final grievance is the upgrade system.  The game has you collect points to upgrade your weaponry of choice with, allowing you to hold 2 weapons at a time.  Upgraded weapons are vastly superior to non-upgraded ones, meaning you'll often stick with the ones you upgraded instead of picking whatever would objectively be a better weapon for the situation.  It is here that the game is also a little bit schizophrenic.  On the one hand, it allows you to steal the weapons your enemies use if you run out of ammo.  However, ammo packs and chests are plentiful and dying resets you to your last checkpoint with full ammo regardless of how much you had when you passed that point.  In addition to that, you'll only find enough points to upgrade 2 or 3 weapons properly, further encouraging you to really just use whatever you picked as your first upgrade choices for the entirity of the game and killing off what could have been a good way to add challenge to the game.Still, maybe it was because was I going through a backlog of generic shooters at the time and had low standards going in, but I really am glad I picked this one up.  It impressed me enough to write a review at least and I really only do that for games that leave a mark in some way.			"

It shines in all the areas where it tries to be different. Akin to something like Fracture, it doesn't shine when it needs to do simple mechanics.Don't think ""it'll be fine, it's cheap"".Don't waste your money on this SINGLE PLAYER game unless you know you're going to play it a lot.

The air combat and cover based shooting mesh surprisingly well and I found switching between them to be fairly smooth and intuitive.I did read some other reviews mentioning that the air game was hard to control, however I believe this is because the game was designed to be played with a controller.  By realising that fairly early, I had no problems at all.  In fact I found that the whole air game felt particularly ""good"".  You can buzz around with your jetpack, take over enemy aircraft, hop into friendly AA turrets and seamlessly move between flying and hovering.  Note that the game doesn't really tell you to do these things though, I didn't even realise I could take over enemy ships until halfway through.  Still, it is small optional elements like this that sold the game to me.  In fact, I was impressed enough that if someone told me these developers made an open world game using the mechanics demonstrated here, I would probably throw some money its way.Naturally, it has its flaws.  Chief among which that the game is rather short and a bit random at times, most likely because the developer was more ambitious than its wallet allowed.  There are some signs of separate segments of the storyline being Frankensteined together in an attempt to keep things coherent after money ran out, but all in all this won't bother you much and I felt that a good job was done all things considered.  At least not until the very end.  There the game ran out of steam and threw in two bossfights in quick succession that obviously were only thrown in because it is what was finished.  Oh well.  Bigger titles have done the same with less excuse.Another issue I had was the placement of the checkpoints, which were not always properly spaced.  There was a defend section I had to do over a few times because I failed a quicktime event and died instantly.  Yes, the game has quicktime events.  That's another minus.  A minor saving grace there is that they are short, sometimes optional and, in the case of one particular hostile, even allow you to choose which quicktime sequence you want to do by picking between two different prompts.My final grievance is the upgrade system.  The game has you collect points to upgrade your weaponry of choice with, allowing you to hold 2 weapons at a time.  Upgraded weapons are vastly superior to non-upgraded ones, meaning you'll often stick with the ones you upgraded instead of picking whatever would objectively be a better weapon for the situation.  It is here that the game is also a little bit schizophrenic.  On the one hand, it allows you to steal the weapons your enemies use if you run out of ammo.  However, ammo packs and chests are plentiful and dying resets you to your last checkpoint with full ammo regardless of how much you had when you passed that point.  In addition to that, you'll only find enough points to upgrade 2 or 3 weapons properly, further encouraging you to really just use whatever you picked as your first upgrade choices for the entirity of the game and killing off what could have been a good way to add challenge to the game.Still, maybe it was because was I going through a backlog of generic shooters at the time and had low standards going in, but I really am glad I picked this one up.  It impressed me enough to write a review at least and I really only do that for games that leave a mark in some way.			"

												I reeeeally don't know how I feel about Dark Void. Gameplay wise it's quite fun, it hasn't aged too bad graphically in 4 years... but Yahtzee from Escapist sumed it up quite nicely... Dark Void was the game that had disappointed him most in his reviewing career - not because it was bad, but rather because it was ambitious. In stretches it was very engrossing, innovative and fun, but in the end felt both too short and too unfinished, as if the developers had run out of money or time or will. It really is a shame, I really wanted this series to continue... Oh and the fantastic soundtrack (albeit pretty small) was composed by Bear McCreary, composer for Battlestar Galactica. I think I know where a great deal of the money went now... I only recommend this because I had fun playing it... it certainly won't be for everyone.  "

												A fun & well designed game plagued by some annoyances.The Unreal engine has never had great mousefeel, and unfortunately, this game reminds why I despise that engine so much. The smoothing, combined with the horrible mouse sampling means that zoomed in weapons jerk around the screen & jump, not moving smoothly. I had to switch the DPI on my mouse from 800 to 200 while zoomed to keep control. Inexcusable.The PhysX runtime included is unstable, but deleting the outdated dlls from the game directory solved instability.The game ends abrupty, a suffers from some overly long ""escort"" type missions, but still remains fun throughout.Get it on sale. Also, Nikola Tesla. That is all.			"

												The game is basically about Nolan North as a rocketeer set in an alternate early 20th century. Overall I liked the game a lot and thought the air battle sequences played very well and were reminiscent of Crimson Skies on the original Xbox. The on foot parts played like a poor mans Uncharted which is not to say it was bad but wasn't as smooth as uncharted. Graphics had an interesting art style but not the best looking game. Ran really well on my rig and did have some nice physx effect on explosions and the smoke trail from the rocket pack.The story wasn't anything to ride home about but felt like an old cheesy sci-fi show which can be enjoyable. Also the last boss fight was easy but epic. Also just happy it had a boss fight. "

												I'll put it simply:-Unimaginative story-Painful cutscenes-Short, really short-Ground sequences, while fluid, have way too much emphasis put on them-Flying sequences are the best part of the game, there is just not enough of them-Final boss/mission was over in 4 minutes and was extremely easy on hard difficulty.-Speaking of difficulty, it was too easy up until it got nintendo hard in some places (TVTropes.org would explain that term) -Too many quick-time eventsCould have been a really good game but it felt like the devs were really lazy with Dark Void.Really wanted to fly around more.

												After a long wait, I recently tried to actgivate and it looks like the steam keys are now working.  Huzzah.I've not played vary far into it; little over an hour. So far, I am seeing a fun and original game.The up & down dynamic of the jetpacks keeps the experience fresh and is making me learn a new skill, rather than retreading the same old shooter skills.Combat makes use of cover and it seems that the health system is one of those dynamic 'don't take too much all at once' systems rather than the tired health-bar.  This keeps the action moving forward and means that the player has to slow down at times, but generally not replay sections.Very happy with it and looking forward to seeing more of this unqie brand of action.Definitely play with gamepad, not mouse!  I usually use mouse for shooters, but even with carefully adjusted sensitivity, it was hard to control. "

												Some of the worst flying controls of all time, comparable to the helicopters in GTA 4 and 5. I put 5 hours into this game over the period of about a year only because I liked the ground combat and some of the gameplay elements. I recently played the game again and got to a mission where you have to follow a extremely slow airborne ""ark"" and protect it. I sat here and played through the level for probably 15-20 minutes and it just won't end because the ark goes about 1mph if that, It is prolonged by the ark's health bar dropping down and I can't do much to stop it and don't want to. One of the biggest fails of a game ever. Capcom games have always been hit or miss and this is a big miss. It deserved all of the negative reviews it got when it came out because it sucked then and sucks now. God awful flying control, some horrible missions like the one I explained, and stuttering from bad optimization. Finally uninstalled and will be permanently forgotten.3/10 blows			"

												This game is frankly a good idea hampered by the simple fact of money, or lack of it. The game is written like a cheesier version of Uncharted and the plot ends up going slightly mad towards the rather abrupt ending caused by what I guess would be a sudden lack of money forcing Air Tight to piece together what they had in the hopes they could salvage something.However the one thing this game has going for it is the jetpack gameplay which is honestly seamless and fantasticly fun to grind Will's face on a wall because you accidently activated the jetpack indoors. I would recomend this game but honestly don't expect a long fantastic game it's a good little bit of fun if you treat it like that and keep in mind they ran out of money so go easy on Dark Void, it is trying as best it can.For a lets play please visit my new channel;

												Dark Void™ is a sci-fi action-adventure game that combines an adrenaline-fueled blend of aerial and ground-pounding combat. Set in a parallel universe called ""The Void"", players take on the role of Will, a pilot dropped into incredible circumstances within the mysterious Void. This unlikely hero soon finds himself swept into a desperate struggle for survival, joining forces with a rebel human group called The Survivors. Trapped in the Void, these resistance fighters are battling to hold off a mysterious alien race that plans to threaten Earth. Dark Void’s unique combination of jet pack-booster aerial dog fighting and third-person combat brings a thrilling new gameplay dynamic to the third-person shooter experience. Taking 3D action to a whole new level, Dark Void’s unique vertical combat system allows players to dangle from thousand foot drops as they take cover and hurl enemies to their doom, bringing a whole new sense of tension and thrill to the player. Will is also equipped with a powerful rocket pack which allows for fierce in-air combat, hurtling through the Void at blistering speeds while shooting down anything that gets in his path.			"

												As generic as third person shooters go. Capcom made an effort to differentiate this game by implementing the vertical platforming/shooting aspects of the game as well as the jetpack sections, but when all you're doing in these sections is shooting the same swarms of enemies over and over (and the shooting itself feels weightless and unsatisfying) it's hard to give the devs credit. Overall the game just feels like a poor man's version of the original Uncharted.			"

												This game takes way too long to instal and verrify. Then you have to deal with the game crashing as you try and adjust the resolution and whatnot. At least I didn't have to fiddle with the .ini files.I love this game, despite it being overwhelmingly meh. You will probably play it, finish it, and then forget it ever happened, except for one or two flashbacks to the awkward controls and the insane B-movie action bits.For some reason, whether it be an issue with my mouse or with the game, I found that it takes multiple clicks to actual fire a weapon or aim, and then again to stop aiming.  The camera get wonky at least 5 times a missing and the movement in and out of cover is really sort of nonsensical and weird occasionally. The whole thing takes itself a bit too seriously, and ends up with an endearing campyness. The characters are cartoony when you see their faces and the dialogue is somewhat cringey. The story is cliched and the ending is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. But I'll be damned, I love this game. Then, you get a jetpack and realize how weird and crazy the flight controls are.Really, the game is quite♥♥♥♥♥♥in the same way that Sharknado is♥♥♥♥♥♥ It should be terrible and boring, but it's amazing and glorious in all its failings. Oh yea, and there's giant mech sloths that shoot lazers. MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING MECH SLOTHS THAT SHOOT LASERS. How could you not love that.

												Where can I start with this game... This game's gameplay and short campaign would be great on a device like the Playstation Vita, but on stationary consoles and PCs, this game just doesn't cut it. The gameplay is poor with bad controls and dull weaponry. It has a very bland ""Main Character is voiced by Nolan North and he isn't playing Nathan Drake"" basic feel to it. The main selling point, the ""Rocketeer"" look and badass looking jetpack are ruined by just how bad the flying is handled and how easy it is to die by crashing withought a ""God Mode"" cheat enabled. There is hardly any story to be had here, and to save you time and money, the girl dies at the end. Don't buy this bad game. 5.2/10.			"

												One of the biggest failings on consumer's part in a long time, this game, while criticized justly, is really unique and deserved better reception/sales.  The game revolves around the use of a Jetpack and it does so in such a beautiful way it is like playing a air combat game like Ace Combat one moment, then with the press of a button you switch to hover mode and its like the jetpack parts of San Andreas but with nice and responsive controls.  And finally once you hit the ground, it becomes a competent third person shooter with standard cover mechanics.  Except if you are by a ledge where you take vertical cover and fire down or up on enemies.  The vertical cover moments really feel like those crazy moments in the Time Crisis arcade games where your character uses something really rediculous for cover, like in Time Crisis 3 where you take cover by a ledge then hang upsidedown to return fire.  And then at any time you get bored of the ground you hit a few buttons and you are flying away like you just hijacked an airplane in Just Cause 2, which you can actually do using your jetpack incase you want some extra protection.  The criticism leveled at the game isn't wrong, although for me I had no issues with controls or framerate, but I think that was console criticism.  There was 1 part early on that caused a CTD but running the game in windowed mode got me past it and afterwards the game only had 1 more crash which is pretty good considering Triple A titles everyone owns crash more frequently.The game sadly suffers from being either too ambitious or being rushed, there are a few rapid jumps through time where it feels like the developers had an extra hour of gameplay planned and skipped it, and this really does make the game in the end sort of disappointing, however once you get your rocketpack addition to the jetpack, you will want to just fly around and never stop.  But the game does stop, and it stops very abruptly and the poor reception the game got probably means we won't see a game with this type of unique gameplay for a long time.If you enjoyed using the grappling hook in Just Cause 2, the Sky-Rails in Bioshock Infinite, the VTOL vehicles from Saints Row, or just the idea of freeroaming huge areas with a jetpack, you won't regret buying this game at it's current price, and if its on sale you are doing yourself a disservice by not getting it, its not an epic, but it is something anyone who wants to be able to fly around a series of huge battlefields should at least give a try.

												ONE OF THE MOST UNDER RATED GAME EVER. This game is amazing once you get the controls down. I do recommend you get a controller to play this game. Its like a sci-fi Uncharted Drakes fortune. same character actor as Nathan Drake. You get to fly UFO and  a  jetpack.Once you get your jetpack which in about the 3rd level you start to get these decent sized sandbox areas you can fly in. Use these areas to practice flying. Really get it down. You need a controller.  THIS IS IMPORTANT Clicking in your joysticks alous you to quickly flip your flying in the other direction. Also learn how to break when you are flying and when to boost up. Once you get the flying down you have these sandboxes with UFO bases around a open map. There are UFOs flying around drying to shoot you and other human survivors. You can fly up to these UFOs, Latch on to them mid flight. do a easy quicktime event. Dodge the turret on the UFO. Rip open the cockpit. Blow the pilots head off. Hop in his UFO and fly around. It is freaking awasome when you know how to do it and no other game does it like this. Also you fly up into floating enemy bases and blow them out of the sky. There are some Bosses. Even Huge ones that you can climb on and take out similar tot he way you take out a UFO. Also The cover and fighing is just like uncharted. grenades and everything. The game is Sci Fi and takes black in the burmuda triangle. I Think it has very good story. Illuminaty snake people ancient history. it is really cool. If you like uncharted and you Love sci-fi you owe it to yourself to buy this game if it is on sale. Just get the flight controls down. Get the Flying cover controls down you will have a blast like no other. I really wish they would make another one of these games. 10/10 It came out when the PS3 was first released so dont exspect it to look next gen but it looks good. just as good as the first uncharted game.  Edit: just read all the bad reviews. I bought the game years ago when the DRM worked fine and when i reinstal i never have any issues. Besides the really bad DRM this is a great game.Edit. I guess the DRM issue is fixed. Good stuff!			"

												This is likely the most unoriginal game I've ever play - So much so that the most common thing I hear in dogfights are ""Stay on target"" and ""I can't shake 'em!"".There's two things that are kind of fun. 1. Flying in the jetpack. Basically the basis of the entire game and still limited almost entirely to dogfights; It may have been a cool thing to base a game around if free roaming was even possible but it's far too linear.2. The vertical fights. They're entertaining, I don't see much like it often but they aren't saved by the other limitations of the game.Other then that, the gameplay is clunky, flying is difficult to get used to. Most fights are won with button mashing prompts similar to other takedowns you can do throughout the game that simply do not very. It gets boring. You gain no abilities, your weapons are very limited and upgrading doesn't feel like it changes much other than how fast you progress through fights.The story is just offensive. No, not like politically corrent offensive, offensive to even be called a story. You're an ex-military (which is mentioned once) pilot who is coincidentally chartered by his ex-lover (AND THE TWISTS JUST KEEP COMING!). Somone you know dies early on when for some unknown reason you fly into the bermuda triangle. There's a weird steampunk like military presence there who's origin is never explained and things are trying to kill you. You survive for a while and then, BOOM! You go through some portal and are in the void. Here, for no apparent reason other then you took some jetpack thing from a dead guy that no one ever actually acknowledges you have, you're treated better then everyone that's been there for years. You're given a room, you're all important. Everyone respects you. But you never make any decisions... you're just a soldier the whole time. Following orders. Yet everyone thinks you're great. Then you turn out the be ""The key"", big surprise, yada yada, the game would be better without cutscenes.If you want a linear game to kill time, maybe buy it for 2 bucks on sale.			"

												Dark Void is a mix of a lot of different games. Take the ground combat of Killswitch and Gears of War, throw in some flight combat like Crimson Skies, add a pinch of human enslavement from Prey and Half Life 2, and you have Dark Void. Now it's not as good as any of those games, but it is worth a play through. The story is an interesting take on The Bermuda Triangle but has more than a few holes in it, but i would like to see someone pick this up and continue on with it. In the right hands and a little more finesse, I think it could turn into a decent franchise. For me the vertical cover system and the ability to go from cover based firefights to hopping in the air with your rocketpack to flank and even strafe your enemies was the freshest and most interesting part of the game. It is without a doubt worth $10 in my opinion. "

												I really don't understand a lot of the bashing this game gets. The biggest gripe you hear is about how short it is, or how the ""devs ran out of money while making it"". I wasn't seeing anything like that. The ending definitely leaves the story open for a potential sequel, sure, but it's not like you're playing and the game just stops and shows the ending at some point. At any rate, it's a lot like Gears of War, but with a jet pack. The flying bits are pretty cool, and it's nice to be able to break out the pack whenever you need to get some height on enemies. There are veritical climbing areas too, and those are also a lot of fun. The gunplay is rock-solid, the upgrade selection is nice and enemy AI seems pretty competent. All in all, definitely worth the $10 they usually charge for it....			"

But the game does stop, and it stops very abruptly and the poor reception the game got probably means we won't see a game with this type of unique gameplay for a long time.If you enjoyed using the grappling hook in Just Cause 2, the Sky-Rails in Bioshock Infinite, the VTOL vehicles from Saints Row, or just the idea of freeroaming huge areas with a jetpack, you won't regret buying this game at it's current price, and if its on sale you are doing yourself a disservice by not getting it, its not an epic, but it is something anyone who wants to be able to fly around a series of huge battlefields should at least give a try.

												DO NOT BUY IT !!!! Too many graphics problems and bugs despite countless tests, fixes present in the forum do not work much, the game would seem nice if it was playable than the beginning. It should not be offered for sale a product so problematic. And the problems encountered them all owners, read the forums related! Do not buy!Ita:Non compratelo !!!! Troppi problemi grafici e bug nonostante le innumerevoli prove, i fix presenti nei forum non funzionano granchè, il gioco sembrerebbe bellissimo se fosse giocabile oltre l'inizio. Non dovrebbe essere messa in vendita un prodotto così problematico. Ed i problemi li hanno riscontrati tutti i possessori, leggetevi i forum inerenti! NON COMPRATELO!			"

I put in whatever product/serial keys I was given and was told ""activation failed"" I went through the securom website, that failed also. I can also see that this is an ongoing issue due to the previous complaints. I went to Capcom's website and was redirected to a blog, which didnt help at all. I can't seem to get anywhere with Steam soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo........I guess I'm S.O.L. with this game. If anyone out there knows a solution please let me know. THANK YOU!			"

At least Capcom support told me they are forwarded my issue to those who can solve it (ancient greek gods, I suppose, because they never solved). After that, silence.Don't buy it. You will never make it work.Update: Finally, after a month or so, Capcom bother to activate my code so I had a chance to play it.The game is not that bad as I saw in some reviews but have a lot of flaws that will drive you crazy.I gave it 5/10 or 6/10 but I still can't recommend it in 2015.

I didn't experience any of the technical problems I see in the reviews, either they fixed them or I'm really lucky. The levels are fun to play in, though some could use a little visual shine. The weapons are cool, though you only get the really awesome ones towards the end, which I really didn't like since I didn't even get to use 1 in combat. Anyway I had fun, now I'm done.

												I really don't understand a lot of the bashing this game gets. The biggest gripe you hear is about how short it is, or how the ""devs ran out of money while making it"". I wasn't seeing anything like that. The ending definitely leaves the story open for a potential sequel, sure, but it's not like you're playing and the game just stops and shows the ending at some point. At any rate, it's a lot like Gears of War, but with a jet pack. The flying bits are pretty cool, and it's nice to be able to break out the pack whenever you need to get some height on enemies. There are veritical climbing areas too, and those are also a lot of fun. The gunplay is rock-solid, the upgrade selection is nice and enemy AI seems pretty competent. All in all, definitely worth the $10 they usually charge for it....			"

												As generic as third person shooters go. Capcom made an effort to differentiate this game by implementing the vertical platforming/shooting aspects of the game as well as the jetpack sections, but when all you're doing in these sections is shooting the same swarms of enemies over and over (and the shooting itself feels weightless and unsatisfying) it's hard to give the devs credit. Overall the game just feels like a poor man's version of the original Uncharted.			"

												Where can I start with this game... This game's gameplay and short campaign would be great on a device like the Playstation Vita, but on stationary consoles and PCs, this game just doesn't cut it. The gameplay is poor with bad controls and dull weaponry. It has a very bland ""Main Character is voiced by Nolan North and he isn't playing Nathan Drake"" basic feel to it. The main selling point, the ""Rocketeer"" look and badass looking jetpack are ruined by just how bad the flying is handled and how easy it is to die by crashing withought a ""God Mode"" cheat enabled. There is hardly any story to be had here, and to save you time and money, the girl dies at the end. Don't buy this bad game. 5.2/10.			"

												Its not a the greatest game, but for 5$ or less when its on sale, it is really worth it.The shooting is solid, the cover mechanic is....unique and may be disorienting for some cause you can take cover on wall and roofs so it. I liked it but i can see some people not liking it.The big HICK of the game is the jet pack and that change a lot of the gameplay suprisingly. The jetpack / ground shooting can lead to some epic moment when your♥♥♥♥♥♥ship, then hijack one of them, destroy the other ships, eject, get in the base while flying with your jetpack drop a grenade in the generator and the BOUM everything explodes. ♥♥♥♥ING EPIC!!!

												ONE OF THE MOST UNDER RATED GAME EVER. This game is amazing once you get the controls down. I do recommend you get a controller to play this game. Its like a sci-fi Uncharted Drakes fortune. same character actor as Nathan Drake. You get to fly UFO and  a  jetpack.Once you get your jetpack which in about the 3rd level you start to get these decent sized sandbox areas you can fly in. Use these areas to practice flying. Really get it down. You need a controller.  THIS IS IMPORTANT Clicking in your joysticks alous you to quickly flip your flying in the other direction. Also learn how to break when you are flying and when to boost up. Once you get the flying down you have these sandboxes with UFO bases around a open map. There are UFOs flying around drying to shoot you and other human survivors. You can fly up to these UFOs, Latch on to them mid flight. do a easy quicktime event. Dodge the turret on the UFO. Rip open the cockpit. Blow the pilots head off. Hop in his UFO and fly around. It is freaking awasome when you know how to do it and no other game does it like this. Also you fly up into floating enemy bases and blow them out of the sky. There are some Bosses. Even Huge ones that you can climb on and take out similar tot he way you take out a UFO. Also The cover and fighing is just like uncharted. grenades and everything. The game is Sci Fi and takes black in the burmuda triangle. I Think it has very good story. Illuminaty snake people ancient history. it is really cool. If you like uncharted and you Love sci-fi you owe it to yourself to buy this game if it is on sale. Just get the flight controls down. Get the Flying cover controls down you will have a blast like no other. I really wish they would make another one of these games. 10/10 It came out when the PS3 was first released so dont exspect it to look next gen but it looks good. just as good as the first uncharted game.  Edit: just read all the bad reviews. I bought the game years ago when the DRM worked fine and when i reinstal i never have any issues. Besides the really bad DRM this is a great game.Edit. I guess the DRM issue is fixed. Good stuff!			"

												One of the biggest failings on consumer's part in a long time, this game, while criticized justly, is really unique and deserved better reception/sales.  The game revolves around the use of a Jetpack and it does so in such a beautiful way it is like playing a air combat game like Ace Combat one moment, then with the press of a button you switch to hover mode and its like the jetpack parts of San Andreas but with nice and responsive controls.  And finally once you hit the ground, it becomes a competent third person shooter with standard cover mechanics.  Except if you are by a ledge where you take vertical cover and fire down or up on enemies.  The vertical cover moments really feel like those crazy moments in the Time Crisis arcade games where your character uses something really rediculous for cover, like in Time Crisis 3 where you take cover by a ledge then hang upsidedown to return fire.  And then at any time you get bored of the ground you hit a few buttons and you are flying away like you just hijacked an airplane in Just Cause 2, which you can actually do using your jetpack incase you want some extra protection.  The criticism leveled at the game isn't wrong, although for me I had no issues with controls or framerate, but I think that was console criticism.  There was 1 part early on that caused a CTD but running the game in windowed mode got me past it and afterwards the game only had 1 more crash which is pretty good considering Triple A titles everyone owns crash more frequently.The game sadly suffers from being either too ambitious or being rushed, there are a few rapid jumps through time where it feels like the developers had an extra hour of gameplay planned and skipped it, and this really does make the game in the end sort of disappointing, however once you get your rocketpack addition to the jetpack, you will want to just fly around and never stop.

												The game isn't bad, I played it and finished it in the past and thought I'd buy it on steam to replay it, unfortunately what I had forgotten is that the mouse and keyboard controlls are very broken while using the jetpack, it's hard to turn and for some reason it's impposible to keep going straight even if you don't touch the mouse.Buy the game if you feel comfortable with a controller, but if you want to use mouse and keyboard you're going to have a very very hard time.

												 The blandest bland that had ever blanded. The initial freedom of the jet pack makes things interesting and then...nothing. Nothing new is introduced to KEEP things interesting. 6 boring weapons. Only a handful of enemy types with some of the worst QTE's I've ever seen (they drag on FOREVER). Basically to ships you can hijack and fly. Unfortunetely it really seems like half a game. Hard to recommend.			"

												Activated in February 2017, the activation server works fine, so those of you who are worried about activation can stop worrying. With that said, the game was... not that big of a deal. Basically, this game was Rocketeer turned into a game with a bit about Bermuda Triangle thrown in where our hero fights a bunch of weird aliens machines after being sucked through ""The Void"".  The third-person view can be problematic or not depending on your tolerance level, but I agree with others that a controller is definitely needed due to a lot of combo moves, like left stick and jump to shift platforms, and so on. My problem is with some of the checkpoints. Only a few chapters in, I was supposed to take out two generators to allow the ship to escape. The idea is drop on the platform, kill everybody, open the bottom shield (savepoint) then fly down there, land, the climb my way up, kill everybody, then somehow trigger self-destruct AND get out before the whole thing blows up. It was explained that just drop off edge of the platform and drop straight down. Except... If you were off and hit a cross beam, or you did not shift in time into flight mode, you get to repeat the attack (!) as you would have died and get to resume from the savepoint (!).  When you finally get this right, you get to do the other generator, except the direction is flipped... Fight to open the top, fight your way down, then escape by going up. And it can only get even MORE complicated. There is a minor weapon upgrade system, but the currency was in very short supply, and there are quite a few weapons. If you like semi-Retro aesthetics and gameplay, I guess this ain't that bad.			"
