												It is a bit difficult to find truly great twin stick arcade shooters on PC. There are quite a few of them around, but my search has been to find something as close to the PSN great Super Stardust HD as possible. A truly amazing twin stick shooter that many of us even got for free after the infamous ApocalyPS3 where PSN got hacked a few years back. Our reward was free games for not being able to login for a month! I ended up with Super Stardust HD, Little Big Planet, and inFamous as mine so I did well, but Super Stardust HD was the big surprise of the lot and I have been searching for a similar twin stick shooter ever since. Waves may not be the same as Super Stardust HD, but I am very happy with the similarities and this style of twin stick shooter regardless. So my search for similar games to SSHD actually DOES result in finding some other greats now and then. In SSHD you played on a sphere where you orbited planets and destroyed asteroids and enemies with bombs and a boost. This spherical type of Twin Stick I have yet to find another one worthy of mention unfortuantely. In Waves you are inside a flattened circle,  but it does give me the close-quaters bombs and instead of a boost it gives us a ""Slo-mo"" feature to get out of sticky spots. Waves is easily one of, if not the best twin stick shooter on Steam imo. It has a similar graphical style of Geometry Wars where everythng is minimal, but that is perfectly fine and works well. It serves up massive combos like most shooters should have and has a great deal of different game types you can play. In fact I was very impressed by the amount of different game types avaialbe in Waves, and these have been doled out for free over the course of its life. The main game type, however is Survival, and it means what survival means. Stay alive as long as you can and try to get the highest score possible. Unfortunately, the game has a max score limit of just over 2.1 Billion. It's not particularly easy to get here, but it is there. There are only a couple hundred Waves experts who sit a top the leaderboards with this max score so you aren't going to get to it without A LOT of practice and time played. I am not one of these experts who has achieved the score...yet. Other game types include Bombing Run, which you play with just bombs. Hold, which was just released in March, is a mode where you can only use your weapons when you are inside a designated area of the screen. So no flying all over the place to avoid things, you must get into the attack zone to keep yourself alive. Crunch time gives you quick events that you must beat from other game modes. This is just a few of the game modes and there are 6-7 total if I remember correctly. All with their own Steam Leaderboards for the community, friends, and Local. The Leaderboards actually work too unlike many of the other shooters on Steam right now. (ie. Scoregasm, although Scoregasm is a pretty fun TS shooter for a cheap price)Waves is definitely a GREAT twin stick shooter for any fan of the genre and I would highly recommend it. If you are one that wants to get massive scores and are willing to put in the practice and play time you can get there. With all the game modes available, and the time it may take to reach a score you can be proud of, you will be able to play for dozens of hours, if not 100+ hours. Waves is now a staple of my Steam gaming library for when I just want to jump in a game and start shooting things!Steam Achievements are plentiful and are broken down to each different game mode so you can only get them all by trying all the modes. They aren't particularly imposible to get, although your skill level must increase greatly as well as your undestanding of the mechnics to achieve most of them. Gamepad support is fine (BTW...TWIN STICK Shooter means they are meant to be played with...TWIN STICKS, not a keyboard and mouse...lol) with the XBox 360 gamepad, although I use a PS3 Dualshock 3 Gamepad with the DS3 Tool. For me, I wanted to flip the buttons around for bombs and slow-mo so using the DS3 tool made that very easy to do without having to go into an .ini file to change it up. There aren't control bindings in the game options so you need to do it manually, or with something like the DS3 tool. DS3 Tool is faster and easier for me as it is just changing the buttons up in the 360 emulation config rather than having to update the .ini file anytime there is a patch, which could replace that .ini file. Waves 2 is now in the works as well and looks to be taking community suggestions of adding many different weapon types and other game styles. From videos I have scene it looks like it has some sort of ""maze"" style to some of the modes where you maneuver around walls and fight enemies this way. Oh yeah...Waves 2 also has a co-op feature it appears. It had a kickstarter a while back, but didn't get funded unfortuantely, but it's still being develped, however and you can find a lot of gampelay videos of it on Youtube. I am lookign forward to that as well. It looks different enough that Waves 2 won't actually ""replace"" Waves as a game I will play. :)			"

A twin-stick shooter with a calm, polished, cybernetic aesthetic, Waves is a solid member of the genre with interesting mechanics but limited content.Waves is a game where you control a sphere rolling within a cylinder, shooting a spray of bullets with the aim of removing an array of shapes which you are motivated to kill because A) They give you points, and B) You blow up and stop moving when they hit you. The game has a few interesting auxilliary mechanics. First is the buffer which is a rechargable bullet-time power that is a main panic button, and the second is bombs that become available based on your combo multiplier. If your combo breaks than the bomb disappears so there is an interesting anxiety if saving a bomb, and also a chance to chain together a large number of bombs for maximum efficacy. As difficulty ramps up and the chances of missing decreases due to the large number of baddies on the screen, bombs become more and more frequent, which leads to a fun chaotic dynamic when things get tougher.This game has a small, understated, relaxing techno themed soundtrack that goes well with the hex-gridded environment and the polygonal, computer themed enemies. It took me a while to appreciate the game's design as there is quite a bit of subtlety, but in the end I appreciated the vision.Though ultimately enjoyable there are some minor gripes. First, I can't pause between death and respawn, though often I wish to simply restart the level after an early untimely death. Also, the challenge mode often perplexingly doesn't trigger success for the challenes appropriately. Further, the UI is a bit crowded and oddly designed. For example, a high score is often displayed proiminently in the middle right of the screen, while the current score is displayed on the middle left of the screen. There is a lot of data on the screen. Aesthetically it works in a sort of augmented vision manner, but practically I would like to reduce a lot of this clutter. My worst is criticism is Ithat he amount of content is limited. Many game modes play out quite similarly and there is only the one stage. After a few hours you've seen it all, and you may not want to grind the same set up repeatedly.Though unfair due Waves' differing mechanics, I feel this game asks to be compared with installments of Geometry Wars. If you liked Geometry Wars, then you will like Waves. If you didn't, you won't. If you've never played Geometry Wars than Waves is a cheap introduction to the genre when it is on sale. The game is a solid effort, and personally, I'm excited for the sequel, which as of this writing is in Early Access.Waves are a physical phenomena resulting from specific excitation in a medium. Most waves involving the medium itself are limited by the speed of sound in that medium, while the travel of optical and electromagnetic waves depends on the speed of light in that medium. This review brought to you in part using waves from Original Curator Group. "

												I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Geometry Wars. The gameplay and graphics are very similar.The scoring and combo system took me a while to get used to, but once I did, it was pretty fun. Perhaps some more effective tutorials would help ease players into the mechanics.My only real complaint is that gameplay sessions lasted a bit too long. Geometry Wars was fun because the sessions were short, and you always wanted to play ""one more time!"". Here you get a bit too many lives.But still, a fun experience overall.			"

												A really fun shooter, which is best played with a controller, and is perfect for a very quick game of a few minutes, to spending hours just trying to up your score, or get to later levels. It consists of an 'arena' in which you can move about freely There are several different game modes each of which have leaderboards, so you can compete with your friends and world.  Has achievements as well.very nice game			"

												Rating 9/10Overview: Twin Stick Arena ShooterThe Good:+The game has an interesting premise. Killing enemies levels you up. Upon leveling, a score multiplier is randomly placed in the arena. Collecting this increases your multiplier by 1 permanently. Killing lots and lots of enemies in a short period of time also increases your combo meter. When your meter reaches 10 you get to drop a bomb that kills enemies in the surrounding area. You can also slow down time for a brief period if this get a bit too crazy. You add all of this together and you get a fun fast shooter .+ The game has plenty of interesting modes to keep you engaged. Each mode is vastly different from the last and offers plenty of different ways to play the game. +Great music+ This game is the definition of pick up and play if you are looking to kill some time. Lots of replayabilityThe Bad:- Some achievements are very hard to get - Can be frustrating at timesConclusionConsidering I got this game for one dollar, it probably is one of the better purchases I've made. If you love the genre then this is a fantastic game to add to your library. If your just a casual fan like myself then you will also find it enjoyable.   "

												This game is both nerveracking and delightful at the same time. I love the music and the CONCEPT of the game is easy. That's about all. Getting high scores and surviving in the multiple modes is addictive. I've just played for a total of 2 hours and my brain feels like it's gonna explode! I would definately recommend this game for everyone with a gamepad. I haven't tried playing without it yet, mostly because it's hard enough WITH a gamepad.			"

												This game is essentially Geometric Battles 2. If you're looking for a quality twin-stick shooter, and you're sick of having so much free-time, then give this a look.PLOT: Roll around, shoot stuff, and don't die.While there are seven modes of play, there are some constants to be aware of. Waves emphasizes the multiplier-system. Every-time you level-up, a multiplier bonus appears on the field. Scores tend to be very top-heavy, the longer you survive, the better your score. However, by playing risky and using the limited slowmo ability, you can tack on another 4X bonus to every shape you destroy. Early on that doesn't mean much, but earning a 60X bonus by level 15 can be very nice. It also pays to keep combos going, because for every 10 shapes, you get a temporary bomb. For most modes, an extra-life is awarded every 10 levels.Crunch Time - You have three minutes to get a high-score. Since time is limited, this mode revolves around maximising the slow-down ability. This is a good mode, especially when you want to play a videogame, but only have a few minutes.Survival - Self-explanatory. You're given a stock of lives and you have to go as long as possible. Every several seconds a wave of enemies surrounds you, which can mix things up a bit.Rush - You're under a time-limit, with extra seconds only awarded through level-ups and destroying cubes. My strategy consists of moving in circles, only going for the multipliers if I bomb through the hordes. Honestly, I think I play it a little too safe, and my score tends to suffer as a result.Bombing Run - No weapons and you have to keep grabbing and exploding bombs to destroy enemies and survive. Your only other means of defense is a shield. It recharges quickly when the action is hectic, but only activates once. I really enjoy this mode, because is focuses on almost entirely on proper maneuvering. Challenge - Destroy enemies as quickly as possible, get a high multiplier, achieve ratings of up to five stars. This mode consists of 20 stages. It's alright, if you're looking for something a bit more concise. The challenges have specific tactics so you're employing more thought into the game aside from: ""I better not run into this shape!""Chase - You have about five seconds to move from point to point while destroying shapes. I guess this mode is directed at guys like me who prefer to play the wall and take it easy. Due to the ultra-stringent time-limit, things will get extremely intense. It's easy to fall into despair, when you have only a second left, and a thick crowd of enemies have blocked off the next point.Hold - You can only fire while in the lit-area. Keep in mind that this is a tight-space to be confined to. You might even have to leave the lit-area just to lure shapes out of your personal space. Those precious multiplier bonuses tend to spawn outside as well. This is a tough mode to play, simply due to how claustrophobic it is. I don't really care for it.While getting overwhelmed in this game is a constant, what actually kills you is usually the one shape that gets away. You're circling around, firing at a huge mass of shapes, but you're not looking at where you're moving to. Guess what happens next? An enemy spawns in your face and you die. Maybe that one shape matrix-dodges your bullets somehow. Yes the game can throw so many shapes on-screen that it'll cause your $1000 PC to freak out, but what kills you? That one shape. I shouldn't have to say this, but focus is the key. If you're distracted for 1/120000th of a second, you're done for.Like its inspiration, Waves has really good leaderboard support. If you have a lot of friends that play this game, all the better. The score of the next person ahead of you is always on display, giving you an incentive to work harder. There's not much else to say really, you probably already own this game(via an indie bundle), but ignored it due its generic title. Definitely give this game a look, you'll likely have a lot of trouble putting it down though.			"

												I've owned Waves since its release in 2011 & I still come back to for a few rounds from time to time. My original review written back then was pretty hyped, basically chanting slogans like ""I'm Hooked"", ""It's Uber!"", ""Grab it now!"" (As you can tell, I was pretty impressed!). In a retrospective (& more balanced) look, Waves boasts solid mechanics, simple design & challenging arenas/modes. Don't be fooled by the simplicity though, this game is hardcore! The small circular 'Neo-Cyberspace' arena to navigate, along with the swiftly increasing viruses, bugs (& other strange spawners)  that trigger wave after wave make this a true challenge to survive for any extended period. This difficulty can be off putting to some, but I really enjoy the intense gameplay - it keeps me coming back .. sweaty palms and all!Being a twin-stick shooter you are obviously able to move & shoot independently on each analog stick, but in  Waves you also have a slow-mo 'Bullet Time' rechargeable power-up which gives you those split seconds needed to make an escape or clear some spawners when things just become too hectic. You can use this strategically to boost your scores too, such as getting a combo to enable your timed 'mega bomb' or get up close & double your points with the 'Point Blank' bonus. Movement & aiming are fluid & these additional tactical features become instinctive to use after a very short time playing.Enemies are distinct, visually, clearly identifiable & have complementing attack moves. They have some cool mechanics, although you will learn there patterns before long (there aren't a lot of different enemies). The sheer numbers in later waves & the combinations of enemies used negates their relative simplicity. When you experience these large number of enemies with the vast amount of effects & action happening on screen, it can be hard to keep track of your location. This is the only downside I have found overall, and is  really due to having such nice graphical effects (take the good with the bad I guess :) ).Of all the modes, the classic Survival mode remains my favourite, although there are another six unique modes also available to tackle. Some are harder than others. There is the Challenge mode offering unique puzzle like waves to clear, Crunch Time offers short burst 3min timed runs & Bombing Run where you have no guns, only bombs to  defend yourself with. Destroy the Cubes as quickly as possible in Rush, try the ‘Run'n'Gun’ Chase mode where you need to hit the spawning markers within 5 secs to continue & the newest mode call Hold where you have a small moving circle to stay within to enable your weapons which I find perhaps the toughest of them all!Below is straight gameplay footage of Survival mode -  A taste of what Waves is like in action:


Waves Gameplay (Survival Mode - 1.6mil run) 
A Video of Waves
By: Aussiedroid

			A brief four & a half minute gameplay video, demonstrating the Survival mode & Waves game mechanics (along with my total lack of skills LOL). It becomes insanely hardcore the further waves you conquer!		


All these great modes, enemy types & overall challenge add up to a lot of replayability. When you wrap that up  in some smooth controls, gorgeous visual eye candy, pumping electro musical score (that has that tendency to get stuck in your head!), add online & friends leaderboards, a swag of interesting achievements & a big picture friendly design, you really have something special. You can see a lot of time has been put in to balance out, refine & improve the gameplay by the one-man development team @ Squid In A Box.Waves has held strong against the tide of new twin-stick shooter titles over the years, remaining one of the best available on Steam. If you missed this when it came out, it’s certainly worth a look now its half the price. It's great quality & great value!Just as much fun to play now as it was when I got it!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations! "

												WOW! This game was EPIC as it should!I got this game when I saw it was on sale, so I quickly buy it to see what's inside.I loved the graphics, but should be increasing the mouse sensitivity as the mouse sensitivity was a little low.The gameplay? Simple, but beautiful!In the game you should shoot AS much as you could because the virus (Usually the enemy, I used to call them ""Virus"")always seeking to you, and that's the best part of the game. Eventually, the virus will grow up, spreading throughout the arena, then eventually, you could be killed by the virus. This game had so many game modes in it, but the only game mode I've played is Survival.Oh! The music was awesome! I've been wondering where in the world I could get the music :vAnyway, keep it up! Beautiful Game, Beautiful Graphics at such a reasonable price!Note : I've made a review of this game, check it out in

 Waves Review - Ace Elite Waves is a fantastice arcade twin-stick shooter, perfect for wasting that 10 minuetes you don't know what do do with you life on. Or 30 mins. Or 2 hours, Like me. Gameplay Waves controls extremely well, with a controller or not. You play as a ball, and your aim is pretty much to blow up everything in the arena to earn XP, to earn multipliers, to earn points. This ball that you play as has a couple of tricks up it's sleeve though, the first is the ability to slow down time, and the second is, after you reach a combo of 10, you can let off this  explosion killing everything within a small area. The scoreboard in this game is amazing, it clearly and neatly displays your friends high scores as well as your own when you end the game. It even displays  your friends high scores during the game to the right of the screen. This suprisingly doesn't interrupt gameplay at all. The game has several modes, Including: Crunch Time, Survival, Rush, Bombing Run, Challenge, Chase and Hold. Survival, which I would say is the main mode here, as it is just classic roll around and kill everything, you have 3 lives and unlimited time to post the best score and every 10 levels, you gain an extra life, in Rush, you have 2 minutes to earn points, and every time you die you lose 10 seconds from your time, Crunch Time throws you into the arena with infinite lives and 3 minutes to just have fun, and that is what you do in this mode, have fun, in Hold mode, you have 3 lives and have to to stay within a circle of light as it floats around the arena,you have to stay inside this as your guns won't work outside of it, Chase is an insane mode where you have 5 seconds to roll over to these red pads, which re-news your five seconds to live, Challenge mode gives you 20 waves of enemies, and 30 seconds to complete each one. Completeing the challenges, (doing it within an amount of time and stuff like that) will award you bonus points, finally there is Bombing Run, which  dissables your guns, and throws down these red pads, you then need to roll over them to pick up the bomb and then go to the green pad before the bomb explodes, when you get the bomb on the green pad, it explodes killing everything. Except you.  Prettyness (or graphics/presentation) Waves has an awesome art style, everything is very crisp and works well together with the amazing neon glow of everything. Sometimes the screen can get a bit crowded, but this isn't too bad. Sounds/Music Waves has an amazing sound track wich fits in perfectly in the background of all this caos. there is also a nice robotic lady-like voice that tells you when your bomb is ready and stuff like that. Verdict This is a fantastic game for just 5 bucks considering the amount of content. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys, um, explosions, guns, balls, cool music and robot voices :).Thanks for reading this!TL;DRHas explosions and guns.Nuff said.			"

												I brought the game because it was cheap on a sale (79p), but it's actually a really good game!It's an arcade style twin stick shooter. I really like the neon-looking style to fit with the theme of Cyberspace and errors & viruses overrunning the arena. The main objective in most modes is to last as long as you can and shoot your way through the waves of enemies, with each wave getting progressively harder. There are different coloured bugs which overrun the arena, each with a different movement pattern and there is also a virus of hexagons which grows over time filling the arena. These viruses are good for shooting to obtain a ""bomb"" which you can use by hitting the space bar, but if you wait too long it will wear off and you won't be able to use it.I love the ""Bombing Run"" mode, where you can't shoot at all but you have to roll and dodge enemies while going from red hexagons to green hexagons to set off a bomb, killing enemies near you. The dodging enemies can require some good skills but you also get a shield every so often to help protect you, the shield basically pushes enemies back if they hit you for a short amount of time acting like a instant second life.Also - Achievements! ^_^			"

												This is a good twin stick game, though not quite as polished as Geometry Wars 2 or 3. Looks wise it  delivers for the most part and I like the short written verdict on your performance after each game, a nice touch.The bomb dynamic is a refreshing and clever new twist on the GW format. I'm not totally convinced about the slow-mo ability which seems like an unavoidable fix for the inertia based player movement. Without it you simply cannot change direction quick enough to avoid some potentially impending deaths. With it I feel like I'm activating a cheat, albeit a metered one... The longer I've played it the more these two issues bug me but on the whole the gameplay is pretty good, maybe just not quite perfect for my own taste.I would have liked the leader boards to show the total number of scores/players, this is a common annoyance also found in the GW games, it is hard to measure your standing without it. It is good and I would definitely recommend it still, but not as much as when I first played it. Waves 2 is out in early access and I am tempted, while the slow-mo ability remains the player movement looks to be greatly improved...			"

												The ball who shoots other ballsThis has to be one of the best game you can play when you got nothing to do.This is not really a game that i would sit and play for hours more like minutes every now and thenStandard Rules: If any of the balls touches you, you die so that's why you have lasers to shoot them before they touch you because they charge you like bulls.The map or whatever is circular and the balls spawns randomly and you can ofcourse you move around to dodge and shoot.There are high scores in the game that you always try to beatIt's really fun and there's many different game modes but one thing for sure, the action never ends!It's everything to survival and different challenges and the soundtracks are awesome!It even got one of those sweet GLaDOS voices! Like cmon buy it already!This game is really worth the money, I would buy it again.rating 7.5/10 - ☠ Pirate ☠			"

												Waves, where being a ball that spits out bullets becomes fun. I think it's a shame waves always takes place in the same map, I wish there were more of them. I don't think it would too much effort. The graphics are avarage for an arcade game, (naturally) there is no story, the controls are very userfriendly and the gameplay is fast and satisfying. I love the local highscore feature. It's too bad waves only has like what, three soundtracks?I personally like this game a lot, it's great to kill some time with (for example when you're facing a long loading screen), has user friendly gameplay and is fun to play with friends. I'll rate this game a 7 out of 10.			"

It has a great feel with points, powerups, and bombs. Check it out if you have any interest in the aforementioned games, because this is well worth the price (at $0.99 at time of writing).			"

												I guess for a shooter that isn't beatable, it doesn't make sense to wait until I beat it to review it, and I've played it for several hours already. This is just super great. In some ways it's just a very well done twin-stick shooter, which makes for a good game but doesn't really stand out by itself. It's polished, and all the fundamental mechanics feel and look and sound good. The things that really keep me coming back for a couple rounds every few days are the extra mechanics on top of the basic ones and the well thought out game modes (one in particular).A slow motion ability is not exactly a new or unique concept, but it's used well in this game, with a limited meter for it that drains VERY quickly and recharges moderately quickly, so it's very often available, but only in small amounts. You also get bonus points while using it, so you have to decide whether to trade off using it to save your life or be risky and use it to pad combos for more points. The other main mechanic is the bomb system. Your combo multiplier goes up as you kill more enemies without a break of more than I think three seconds in between, and at certain multiples you're awarded a bomb, which as in most games insta-kills anything in a relatively large radius around you. However, unlike most games, you cannot save it for later use. You have a few seconds to activate it, or it's gone forever. If timed/chained properly though, you can use a bomb to get you a good chunk of the way to your next bomb, then repeat. Of course, when there are enough things on the screen that you can get away with that, you need to be on your toes or you won't last long.It has some common game modes like unlimited time with a limited number of lives, or infinite lives but a fixed amount of playtime, and some more exotic or panic-inducing ones like the one which lights up a small spot on the screen, and if you don't move to it within a few seconds you die. Once you get there, it picks a new random location. Oh, and you also have to keep playing the normal game while doing that. Good luck. The one I've really gotten stuck on is Bombing Run, which takes away your guns entirely but continues to spawn enemies. It places a bomb pad at a random location where you can pick up a bomb, at which point it creates a delivery point at a different random location. When you bring the bomb there, it detonates like a bomb in the other normal modes, and a new bomb pad is generated. If you get a high enough combo, you can get a single-use defensive shield, but mostly it's about positioning, movement, and reading patterns and paths through what becomes a huge, chaotic mess at higher levels. It's really great for practicing that stuff without being distracted by all the shooting you're normally doing in most modes of most games, and it's just plain fun.			"

												Twin joystick shooters tend not to be for me, but I find myself enjoying this game a lot. The game feel is dead on and there's some real momentum to contend with. The player's weapon never changes (I think) and the survival mode is all I want it to be really.I don't find myself getting into the other modes of play, but they're there if you want them. I'll probably update this review as I play the game more, but if you want something with good game feel and a good few songs then this is a pretty solid $5.00 to spend. I'd wait for it to be on sale or a bundle though. There are other games like this with more content out there.			"

Who doesn't love Arcade-Games?Waves is a typical example for one of these. You have to eliminate the opposing balls as a ball. Sounds boring but this is not the case at all.The Fun-part starts simply by the fact that there are several gamemodes. I personally just play three of them because they are the best in my opinion.ModeDescriptionCrunch TimeAchieve as many points as possible within 3 minutesSurvivalThe round ends as you lose your 3 lives. Besides trying not to die, you try to score as high as possible.RushA mix out of the upper two modes: You have 2 minutes, for every achieved level you will get 10 seconds, for every time you die you will lose 10 seconds.Other GamemodesI didn't really play them, because the upper three are the best in my opinion. :)Graphics9/10Sounds10/10Gameplay9/10Atmosphere8/10Overall9/10Conclusion: A great casual game with fitting music and a slight bit of addiction potential.

Not mind-blowing, but will leave a smile on your face.If you enjoyed Geometry Wars or enjoy topping high scores, this is the game for you.  I wouldn't pay full price unless you dearly love the genre.  I would highly recommend waiting for a sale of $1 or less and kill a few hours with it.			"

												A hectic and vibrant twin-stick arena-based shooter that delivers. The Good:- Includes several different unique game modes, which each provide their own challenges, and each are even entertaining in their own right.- The graphics are lively and vibrant, and add to the feeling of the overwhelming odds stacked against you.- The bomb mechanic is excellent.  I get chills thinking about times I cleared the arena with 3 consecutive bombs strikes just as i was getting overrun.- Has a good variety of distinguishable enemies, and the slowly-growing ""virus"" is a wonderful touch that allows you to turn an encroaching foe into an arena-clearing weapon.- I think the music is good. Honestly I can't remember it.- The game has the derisive sense of humor of an older brother.- It's made by a studio called Squid in a Box, which might be the best studio name ever.- The game menus are succinct, fast, and well-designed.The Bad:- With everything going on around you and the colorful graphical effects it's easy to lose track of what's going on. - The leaderboards seem hacked.  Everyone in the top 10 or whatever has the exact same astronomical score.- Some people might be turned off by the pace of this game. Overall I recommend this game, especially if you like fast-paced arcade-style shooters where you die a lot but occasionally have those epic runs you want to tell you friends about.			"

												Probably my new favorite arena shooter. Not a complicated experience, but an enjoyable game to pick up and play, whether you've only got a few minutes to spare, or a few hours. It's a lot like Geometry Wars with more than one mode of play, and with the mechanics tweaked a bit so that the game gets more exciting and rewarding the longer you play and the better you become. The demo is highly representative of the overall experience, so do yourself a favor and check it out. I managed to snag this for $2.50 during a Daily Deal, but if you're into these sorts of games, the asking price of $9.99 isn't shabby considering the insane amount of fun I have with it.			"

												Great game for in between. In theory the game is very simple but after a few seconds it'll become very difficult 'cause one on one million isn't fair ;D . And if you want to max your points you have to use bombs and slomotion. No need to say, but you have to shoot everything around and avoid to collide with one of those little things. Well it's obvious that you need to do this at the same time.The gfx looks awesome and the controlling works fine. Even the soundtrack is great. (Well you have to like the style of chiptune). You can play it with keyboard and mouse or with a gamepad. Both of them are easy to handle but I preffere the keyboard. Even the tutorial is really funny (Hint: you have to read it).You will have much fun with this game for little money and it's definetly worth it!			"

												So far I haven't played much of this game, but when I play more or the game gets an update I will edit my review as I see fit.Waves is a twinstick shooter with the main objective of getting the highest score possible by shooting enemies.Graphics: The graphics of this game are absolutely beautiful. Even the smallest details in this game look amazing. 10/10Gameplay: Personally I haven't found any problems with the gameplay, it's very smooth and fast paced. This game can be played with the sticks on a gamepad, or if you prefer you can play with a mouse and keyboard. 10/10Soundtrack: The music in this game is very nice and fits the ""environment"". 9/10Overall: I love this game and I think it is definetily worth $5 dollars. 10/10 "

												I enjoyed this game quite a bit, its very reminicent of a certain geometric game that has you shooting colorful shapes, while this is more in depth than the PC port of that mini game, the sequel to the minigame, is better than this one, but this is the best you're going to get because the publisher does not want to spend the money to port the sequel over from xbox 360, which is a shame because I enjoyed the hell out of it.This game is different in that, there is a ""leveling"" system that tells you how difficult the game will be as you progress, the game has a great soundtrack and interesting enemy types, I just wish there was more variety in the game types, and weapons for the ship.

The addition of a slow-motion powerup based on kills and a bomb system reliant on kill combos makes for a unique experience. Although the selection of game modes does not differ significantly from Waves' competitors, there is enough variety to offer great replay value for fans of the genre. Highly recommended!			"

												EDIT:  After having broken the game's score counter in Survival mode (it only goes up to 2.4 billion points) I can safely say this game is worth the money.  Get it on sale if you can, but even at full price, it's never boring.This game gets flak for being a bit simple and for being too hard; at the same time, no less!It is what it is; it is a top-down shooter.   You're a ball, a trippy ball.  You shoot other things...there're lots of them, they never end.The music is excellent, the graphics are quite polished and surreal, the game itself hums to the beat of the music; the controls are fantastic with a gamepad's analog joysticks, and there is absolutely no reason a fan of shmups (shoot 'em ups) should not love this thriller.My favorite feature of the game so far is that in the Survival mode, the AI will form nets around you in an attempt to ambush you.  They spawn in a circle and close on you.   One slows down time, punches a hole in the net, and gets out of dodge....or one dies.			"

												I have a soft spot for twin-stick shooters: they're some of the purest arcade style shooters available, and with the simplistic control scheme joined with the even simpler gameplay style, I'm very rarely disappointed with them. Is Waves worth a check out? You betcha.For anyone that doesn't know, a twin-stick shooter is exactly that: the left stick controls you, the right stick aims where you shoot. Easy peasy. The arcade classic Asteroids can be seen as one of, if not the, first twin stick. So with Waves the premise remains the same: see brightly colored geometric shape, aim at it, and watch a pretty display of particles explode out from it. The more shapes you blow up, the more points you get. Blow up enough shapes in quick succesion, the higher combo you attain. High combo means more points. Points are life.Waves breaks up the monotony by implementing a slow down mechanic based upon an ever replenshing gauge: use it to get out of hairy situations or to rack up bonus points. Waves also utilizes a bomb system in which you're awarded bombs based upon your score, but only for a short moment. Miss your chance to use it and it's gone.Waves has a nice selection of gameplay modes, but if there was one issue I had with it, it's that they're all a little short (except for Survival of course.) Each mode has its own score boards, which is cool, and the variety keeps the game from becoming boring. The visuals are nice, the music is pleasing, and the gameplay is tight. If you like Geometry Wars, or simple arcade shooters in general, this is certainly worth the purchase.			"

												This is one of the better games on Steam, it's so very simple yet addictive and good-looking that you just can't stop mashing the buttons. Such colors, very eye candy, wow. Unlike many 2,5 dimensional shooters which are repetitive and uninteresting, Waves is totally awesome like a zombie ninja Jesus riding a motorcycle into outer space.Playing Waves is very easy, but getting good at it is next to impossible. Needs good eye-hand coordination and swift reflexes. The game gets FAST in a minute or two, and that's an old school definition of FAST, where 0,05 second gap really matters and a slightest error kills you instantly. TO DEATH. Like, really.Just go ahead and buy it right now. This game is good, and you should feel good about it.			"

Employs slow motion techniques for extended scoring but usage or buffer depletion lessens recoverability in tight situations so as the great Johnny Cash would say (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-OrzG3id_8).  Allows for zen like mastery where you perpetuate in a zone and keep extending time (Rush mode).  Multiple game modes.  Supports the Xbox 360 controller.

												When it comes to twin-stick shooters, there's not many games that can beat Waves. It's fast, pretty, intense and an incredibly satisfying game. A handful of simple mechanics come together into a score attack masterpiece.			"

												I don't usually write reviews, but for this game I had to make an exception. This game is seriously fantastic. I don't have a ton of experience with twin-stick shooters in general, but I do have some time in them. This game, for me, blew Geometry Wars out of the water. This is mainluy due the different way Waves handles bombs compared to GW. Instead of having 3 screen clearing bombs, you get access to a bomb (for a few seconds, not forever) once your combo meter reaches a certain point. The bomb destroys enemies in a small radius around you. Since you can, in certain situations, build your combo meter very quickly, you occasionally get a short burst of bombs with each bomb killing enough enemies to get you another bomb. It may sound to easy, but it doesn't happen to often and creates a MASSIVE sense of power. It is so satisfying that I just can't get enough.My initial gripe with the game was the fact that it has a slow-mo system that you can activate. At first I found it a crutch, but after the game giving me reminder's after each loss to use it more, I finally clued in. It doesn't last long enough to make it too easy as well. You get a 2x bonus whenever in slow-mode and so I realized using it along with a bomb got me even more points. Oh, by the way, it also has a large selection of actually very fun gamemodes, an amazing soundtrack, visuals, and controls (it even feels good on keyboard and mouse!)Honestly, I can't recommend this game enough. Pick this up right away, you won't regret it.BTW, I mostly played this game offline, hence my small amount of hours.			"

												First thing you'll notice with this game is the need to turn off all bloom, effects, and everything, so you can see what the heck is going on. Second thing will be the terrible controls. Third thing will be how utterly random everything seems to be (what enemies spawn when, where, and everything in between).Add to that how the game will berate, or downright insult you when it thinks you're not using the stupid ""slowmo"" that gets you killed more often than it saves you (because making things slower won't change the bad controls or how much inertia they decided the game needed) often enough, and quite frankly, I really can't recommend this exercise in frustration.I'm sure I could get better with more practice. I'm also sure it wouldn't be particularly fun to do so.			"

												If you like twin-stick shooters (keyboard+mouse is actually more fun) and/or score attack, this is a definite recommendation.I like neither. ... I likeD neither. Then I got Waves. ^^Upsides:- Launches quickly without forcing you to sit through endless logos. (Two skippables, and if you rename the video files, you get undelayed launch.)- Many different game modes that all utilize, hone and broaden the basic skillset of the player.- Good music.- Some peculiar, moderate humor that is almost like a sports coach at times.- Plenty of achievement goals.Generally very motivating. Many details I cannot put into words. The whole package just is a lot of fun.And, hell, it has a demo! You can check for yourself! Yay!Downsides:- You can't choose which music plays.- Maybe some minor obstacles when using a game controller for menu navigation.- Leaderboard display tediously slow.			"

												This game is only good if you can buy it for less than the price of geometry wars: retro evolved. GW:RE outclasses it in so many different ways: better bomb system, better combo system, and better enemies; but, the problems that this game has can be easily fixed with one or two balance patches, but the devs seem to want to use their time putting in community reccomendations for game modes and♥♥♥♥♥♥instead of fixing these. Some specific gripes:Bombs are terrible. They are never usefull when you can get them, unless you can kill a bunch of virus in a small period of time, because the enemies that you killed to get the combo to get the bomb were probably all the enemies in the bomb's radius. Enemies are unbalanced. The clustery things that turn red when you shoot them are a direct upgrade from the 3 little ball things, but they sacrifice speed for survivability: this means that it takes so much more effort to kill them than it does to kill literally any other enemy other than cubes. The green ball things that dodge your bullets are absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t; you could be in a perfectly fine position, then 4 or 5 of these ♥♥♥♥ers spawn in, and suddenly you have to use all of your slowmo to kill each of them individually, and if you miss, you have to resort to killing them outside of slowmo, which poses the same problem as the clustery things- you're using more and more effort to kill something that shouldn't take that much. Enemies use too much rng to spawn. Enemies in this game spawn in seemingly completely random patterns, and take .5-1 seconds to spawn; this means that if you're being overwhelmed in a game and one or two dudes spawn right next to you, you either have to use your slowmo to move out of there, or you instantly die, and you've probably already used your slowmo to survive being overwhelmed. Cubes have too much health for their size and impact on the game. The cubes in this seem good on paper, but when implemented, are absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing broke as♥♥♥♥♥♥in practice. They have the same problem as those other ones I put down, with taking too much effort to kill, exept these ones seriously punish you for not having the answer to them right when they come into play; they need to spawn in when you're in a position to get a bomb fast, otherwise you have this huge death-square coming for you and you can't deal with it without leaving every other enemy unattended. The combo system is trying too hard to be original. Honestly this part could be very easily fixed if the devs understood why most games use either the 'combo is constantly going up as you kill enemies and resets when you die or something' system or the 'combo goes up pretty fast but instantly goes away in a small period of time after you don't kill something' system. The system that waves uses is trying to make the latter better, but fails miserably: you need to kill 3 enemies to get one stack, and that will only happen when you're being overwhelmed by enemies or during an ambush of like 10 dudes. It rewards you for being in situations any sane person shouldn't be putting themselves in, which results in you needing to be lucky/really really good at twin stick shooters to get high scores in survival. The challange mode is absolutely infuriating for completionists. Not being able to go in and pick which levels you want to do and not do is just ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. Having to do that one level that you always ♥♥♥♥ up on when you're doing great in one challange run makes me want to stop playing this. TL;DR: This game is poorly designed and needs balance changes and you shouldn't buy it until the devs fix what I've complained about. 3/10 outclassed by geometry wars in almost every way.Edit: the music is pretty ehh as well, thought I should mention it; easily fixed by turning it off and turning on your own music.

												A fun little diversion that's well made and somewhat clever. Well, what's so clever about it? Light travels in waves, and there's waves in water, and you seem to be a little ball in a petri dish causing waves in the water while viruses, or whatever they are, reproduce. Oh, and there's some music, and sound travels in waves! And when you slow down time, the music slows down! Oh, how clever. There's a twinge of sarcasm there, I know that some have a hard time being able to notice that on the internet. Anyway, the game IS a lot of fun, and it is a very fun diversion, as I stated before. For...a little while. I can't see anyone dedicating tons of time to this game because, to put it simply, it gets boring pretty quickly. It's great to have a game to pick up for a few minutes at a time if you just have a few minutes to kill, and this game is perfect for that. However, it's so similar to some other game *cough* Beat Hazard *cough* that do the concept just a little bit better. The things that make this game unique also make it rather samey in the move-around-in-a-specific-area-and-shoot-crap-dead niche, which I happily subscribe to. Big fat A+ on the gameplayB+ on the visuals, which are nice, but they could stand to be toned down juuuust a hair so that thing you need to pick up to refill your slow motion gauge isn't completely indiscernable from an enemy spawning in the same exact friggin' place (that's not challenging, just cheap.) C+ on the soundtrack - now, don't get me wrong, the songs in the game are FRIGGIN' GREAT, but there's exactly 4, maybe 5 of them. The game could stand to use a bit more variety in a soundtrack. I have a hard time believing that the combined length of the tracks included equals up to the 25 minutes they have set for one of the survival achievements. Overall, 7/10 - would definitely recommend buying, but you won't be putting hours and hours and hours of time into it. Honestly, if it let me use my own music to play with the same game modes, this would probably overtake Beat Hazard for me, of which I've put something like 40 hours into playing. Give us a little bit of customization. I'm begging for a sequel, no, really.			"

A nice variety of game modes, great visuals, an energetic soundtrack, and a hi-score addiction fest make this a winner for me. Surpasses Geometry Wars in many ways. Very happy to have found this game, and for a low price too it's easy to just nab off the marketplace with some card cash.Woot.			"

												The twin stick shooter that I've been waiting for on the PC. I spent a lot of hours on the Xbox 360 version of Geometry Wars and developed a nasty habit, but never got to carry over my sickness to my computer.Now my dreams have come true. A nice variety of game modes, great visuals, an energetic soundtrack, and a hi-score addiction fest make this a winner for me. Surpasses Geometry Wars in many ways. Very happy to have found this game, and for a low price too it's easy to just nab off the marketplace with some card cash.Woot.			"

												Easily compared to Geometry Wars. Ive played both and this by far a better game. Music and controls are top knotch. Just wish there were a few more tracks. Easily worth the $10 or so I paid. Graphics looks great, especially when everything gets hectic and 360 controller works perfectly.			"

												This game is a bit too bland, generic, and abstract. First off, the story:In some games, story is presented as a series of characters with lines of dialogue, and/or events that happen. In other games, story is emergent, in that you create your own narrative based on choices you make. This game has none of that. This is a series of minigames with their own rules and challenges, but they're all meant to be played in short bursts. The result is that you're constantly getting snapped back to a menu, unless you're really really good. I admit I'm not the best at these types of games, even though I enjoy them. What some games do, to compensate for lack of player skill (twitch reflexes) is add RPG or progression elements and difficulty level. So if you're not good enough to make it 30+ minutes without getting snapped back to a menu, add an upgrade system and a difficulty slider so you can grind out some boosts to give yourself an edge. This game doesn't have that. If you want your sessions to last longer, it's on you.The controls are fine. Some people complain about how your avatar (a ball) has physics with inertia and such. That doesn't really bother me too much, but maybe it contributes to the difficulty. Several times I'd find myself getting smacked down in ways that made me wonder if it was poor reflexes or my avatar was just sluggish to correct.Finally, there's the art style. It's 3D neon geometric shapes chasing you around a circular field, with a honeycomb grid underneath that moves in and out of view. There are particles flying everywhere, and when you make kills, harmless bright blue bolts fly out of them and chase you. This makes you feel like you're constantly getting shot at even though you're just collecting ""XP"". (There is a leveling system but all it does is increases the difficulty, it doesn't give you any new skills or stats.) Sometimes enemies charge you at crazy speeds from very short distances, but you can only survive one hit. So your brain is constantly trying to figure out if the things coming at you are friend or foe, and it gets confusing. The abstract art style makes me feel disconnected, unmoved, so I'm less motivated to keep playing.To summarize: This isn't my favorite twin-stick shooter. It has a few cool features (like the time slow that charges up as you make kills, or the bomb that becomes available when you get a 10x multiplier) but to me, the punishing difficulty combined with an abstract art style and lack of progression or difficulty options means I'll be turning elsewhere for entertainment. The short play sessions where you get tossed back to a menu every few minutes makes me just want to head for the exit.			"

												I wrote my opinion on this game in a forum post well-before reviews were added to Steam, so I'll just copy-and-paste it here:Well, Waves is a dual-stick shooter that is aesthetically similar to Geometry Wars 2, but that's about it.I'll sum-up what I think the main differences are:The ship in Waves has weight to it (unlike GW 1 & 2), so you can't just turn on a dime.You can slow-down time (which also grants you a point-bonus per enemy you kill while in slow-mo). This ability recharges at a decent pace.You have bombs, but they works rather differently: When you get a combo of 10 kills, you can use a bomb (you lose it if you lose your combo, though). As you can imagine, there can be a lot of enemies on screen, so getting a 10x combo is mind-numbingly easy to do again and again.There is a Level & Experience system, which is used to scale-up the difficulty for a particular play-session. I find it adds absolutely nothing to the game, and there's no reason to even pay attention to it as you're playing.That said, you can basically play it with your brain off by just going around in circles, and spamming bombs over and over again because of how quick/easy it is to constantly get 10x combos. And not long into a session, there'll be enough enemies to constantly net you those 10x combos that it won't even matter what direction you shoot in anymore.At least, that was my experience playing it the other day, which was the first time in just under one year. I only played the main mode during that session (Survival mode), and on my very first try, got the achievement for attaining the highest score possible. So all Waves left me with was a main game mode that was way too easy to top-out, and a few other game-modes which I distinctly remember not liking very much.So yeah, I feel that those looking for a Geometry Wars fix will find Waves somewhat disappointing. It's not a bad game at all, and might even be a decent distraction if you could get it really cheap, but it left me feeling really underwhelmed - both a year ago, and when I picked it up again the other day.Edit: I made a silly.

												Holy heck this game is bad.  For starters, the graphics are too noisy.  After a minute or two of playing you can't tell enemies from powerups and not only does this cause deaths and frustration, but it's so blatantly trying to rip off of Geometry Wars that it's not even trying to hide how poorly it was handled.The game is uninteresting, mechanics are beyond boring, and the scoring system is fundamentally flawed such that it favors luck over skill in almost every scenario.Finally, the music and robotic voice are interesting at first but like the rest of the game, become annoying after the first few games.Save yourself the time and frustration and play something else.

Quick Breakdown: A twin stick shooter with a couple different modes of play. Its key gimmick is the ability to slow down time for a few seconds. It’ll kill an hour, but not much more.Length: 1 hourGenre: Twin Stick ShooterScore: 5.5/10Full Review: Waves is a twin stick shooter in the vein of Geometry Wars (the first two that is, not so much the third), from which it derives obvious influence. The core gameplay is much the same, pilot a shape with one joy stick, shoot with the other, and destroy different shapes on the map to earn points.Waves has a few differences though. Instead of having a set number of smart bombs, you earn a bomb whenever you get a combo of 10, and you only have a few seconds to use it before it goes away. You also can slow down time for a few seconds, allowing you to pick off enemies that are too close or maneuver away with greater ease. You can only do this for a few seconds at a time, and then it will need to recharge before you can use it again.The game features a few different modes of play, none of which are anything groundbreaking. A time limited mode to see how many points you can score in 3 minutes, a survival mode to see how long you can last before you bite the bullet, and a few others.I got about an hour of play out of the game before I got bored of it. So if you’ve already played Geometry Wars and need another twin stick shooter, this’ll fill an hour. If you haven’t, you’re much better off getting Geometry Wars 3 instead.			"

												Well, its not often you stumble across games such as this, a gem of an indie which is both gorgeous to look at and ridiculously addictive. The basic concept is a two stick arcade / high score / challenge type affair, guiding your ball across the 'waves' and defeating various enemies to achieve combo's and bombs. The urge to keep beating that high score keeps the replayability of this game right up there, aside from your usual 'survival' mode there are other game modes such as challenges, bomb runs etc.All in all, well worth the money and will be one of those games you return to time and time again...worthy of note is the chiptune soundtrack which accompanies this game is pretty sweet as well!

												I don't think I have the reaction times to play this properly. :).  I really enjoy playing Waves.  It's visually stunning, and the music is fantastic.     The choices of games to play is pretty good, and the game rewards the tactical player who looks ahead to see what the next step will be, thereby chaining their moves for bigger and bigger multipliers.  Watching a ripple of destruction echo outwards from the epicenter of your bomb, or taking out a cloud of incoming bogeys with a well-placed storm of bullets is great.     The game can be frustrating at times.  It's a dual-stick game, so it's very easy to momentarily fumble a direction of movement with a direction of firing.   The only downside is that the last time I tried to play it, it crashed on Windows.  No other games crash. Some update must have broken it.  I've reinstalled, to no avail, so it's getting uninstalled :( "

												I found this game in the suggest games that Steam put there for me. The name was what caught my attention. And I have to say that Steam did a REALLY good job by saying I might like this game, considering the ones that I already own. I absolutely love Waves. I bought it like an hour ago and already have over 3 million points! :D I'm thinking that's pretty good, but it might be terrible, I'm not sure.I would not recommend this game to people who like a slow, thought out kind of gameplay. This is a fast paced type of game where you need really good reflexes and awareness. Your eyes have to be constantly searching and your fingers always moving. A lot of things are going on at once, like dozens of explosions, things flying everywhere, bright lights. Its pretty extreme!There are multiple modes to play in (Survival being my personal favorite) and each is unique. The settings are great, you can change the keybindings to your liking and change to mouse sensitivity. The graphics are great and amazingly smooth. The aim seems perfect to me and I always like going into slomo to see my enemies explode. I find it a very pleasurable game and hate to exit it off. Just the fact that I have a high score makes me want to keep playing. And of course you HAVE to beat your friends' score, right?			"

												This game rips off quite a lot  from Geometry Wars, but I wouldn't say that's inherently a bad thing. Geometry Wars is a damn good game, and honestly I think Waves is a far better game.A lot of that sentiment comes from how Waves differs from Geometry Wars in terms of its more nuanced mechanics. While both are minimalist twin-stick shooters with similar art directions (though not identical, since Waves uses 3D models), Waves and Geometry Wars have fairly different ways in which they handle their score multipliers and bombs. Waves also has a bullet-time mechanic that's based on a meter you fill as you destroy enemies, and enemies you kill while slowed down net you a point bonus. You can also get point bonuses from destroying enemies at point blank, in which you have a circle around your ship that shows you the radius enemy ships have to be within in order to get the point blank bonus. Overall I just prefer the mechanics in Waves over Geometry Wars.I haven't played Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2, but from what I've read about it Waves it at least on par as they both offer a good handful of game modes that the original game does not have. Some modes in Waves are pretty much identical to ones in Retro Evolved 2 (Waves' ""Crunch Time"" and RE2's ""Deadline"" operate on the same principle of scoring as high as you can on a time limit), others are mostly similar with a few added wrinkles that slightly change how it plays (""Bombing Run"" in Waves plays much like RE2's ""Pacifism"", but with the added quirk of having to deliver a bomb to a specific point on the map before the bomb detontates on yourself, losing a life in the process). Meanwhile the ""Chase"" and ""Rush"" modes in Waves not like any modes in Retro Evolved 2 (funnily enough, the only mode in RE2 that Waves doesn't have an equivalent for is, in fact, called ""Waves"").Sadly, Retro Evolved 2 isn't available on PC. I don't feel too terribly sad about that, however, as Waves is a fantastic alternative. I can totally respect a developer who decides that they want to make a game that's *ahem* ""heavily inspired"" by an existing title, but then they aspire to make it just as good or possibly even better than the game they're ripping off. Also, the soundtrack has a track in it that samples Kefka's iconic laugh from Final Fantasy VI. I just can't argue against something like that.			"

												Waves is similar to Geometry Wars in the sense that it's a strictly one-arena twinstick shooter. There are no ""natural obstacles"" in the arena, just enemies to shoot.One notable difference is that the sphere the player controls in Waves has momentum, so it won't switch movement directions on a dime. There's also several different game modes.The enemy cavalcade isn't all that impressive, though, based on what I've seen so far.The game has plenty of challenge, mind you, for a semi-casual twinstick shooter fan like me, and it also has online scoreboards.Waves is one of the better twinstick shooters I've played. It's too bad its follow-up failed at Kickstarter.			"

												Well, its not often you stumble across games such as this, a gem of an indie which is both gorgeous to look at and ridiculously addictive. The basic concept is a two stick arcade / high score / challenge type affair, guiding your ball across the 'waves' and defeating various enemies to achieve combo's and bombs. The urge to keep beating that high score keeps the replayability of this game right up there, aside from your usual 'survival' mode there are other game modes such as challenges, bomb runs etc.All in all, well worth the money and will be one of those games you return to time and time again...worthy of note is the chiptune soundtrack which accompanies this game is pretty sweet as well!

Quick Breakdown: A twin stick shooter with a couple different modes of play. Its key gimmick is the ability to slow down time for a few seconds. It’ll kill an hour, but not much more.Length: 1 hourGenre: Twin Stick ShooterScore: 5.5/10Full Review: Waves is a twin stick shooter in the vein of Geometry Wars (the first two that is, not so much the third), from which it derives obvious influence. The core gameplay is much the same, pilot a shape with one joy stick, shoot with the other, and destroy different shapes on the map to earn points.Waves has a few differences though. Instead of having a set number of smart bombs, you earn a bomb whenever you get a combo of 10, and you only have a few seconds to use it before it goes away. You also can slow down time for a few seconds, allowing you to pick off enemies that are too close or maneuver away with greater ease. You can only do this for a few seconds at a time, and then it will need to recharge before you can use it again.The game features a few different modes of play, none of which are anything groundbreaking. A time limited mode to see how many points you can score in 3 minutes, a survival mode to see how long you can last before you bite the bullet, and a few others.I got about an hour of play out of the game before I got bored of it. So if you’ve already played Geometry Wars and need another twin stick shooter, this’ll fill an hour. If you haven’t, you’re much better off getting Geometry Wars 3 instead.			"

												This game is addictive, I mean seriously addictive! Once you start playing you will have to find a way to force yourself to stop or you will be playing the whole day. Its a classic top-down / shoot-em-up survival game (Like crimsonland). The achievements are truly challenging to get but the sense of reward at the end is really amazing, you feel like you've climbed a mountain, fell down 60 of 65 times, given up 4 times and finally succeeded the last time, then you go back for more.I recommend this game to anyone who likes to have their heart pounding in their throat, I have one suggestion to make in regards to this. The game dev's should occasionally clear the highscore board, cause seeing the numbers there could discourage a lot of players(Specially after counterstop)Game is a 9/10 for me, the lack of different weapons is the only thing that really brings it down, but the rest of the game is 5-star quality!

												Waves is an arcade action game that is slightly less twitchy than Beat Hazard and Scoregasm.  The game features a variety of modes that help keep the action refreshing and the addtion of controller support and widescreen modes are welcome.  The graphics are not amazing, but the use of a ball instead of a space ship adds a physics element to the challenge missing in other similar titles.  The music is average, not particularly bad nor memorable but taken altogether Waves is an above average entry into the field.  I recommend this game to anyone who likes either action or strategy, and particularly players that prefer gamepad controller play.			"

Addictive as hell, with multiple fun modes, and ridiculously polished; its only downside is that I now dream of geometric shapes and my thumbs hurt.			"

												What I like best about this game is that the laser weapon is not something to make the game easier but is something to give you a diiferent experience. The bullet gun uses spread fire to quickly & efficiently take out enemies but can sometimes miss. The laser is able to quickly move across enemies eliminating most in quick sucsession, however it sometimes can not penetrate the entire enemy or moves too fast across it. So you see each weapon has advantages & disadvantages. Not many top down shooters like this are that generous. Plus the graphics & gameplay are fanatastic.			"

												Very addictive twin stick shooter. Game design is superb, rewarding hair-raising risk-taking to acheive the really  big points. I haven't experienced that ""one more play"" feeling for a considerable period of time. The mechanics are beautifully tuned and the numerous game modes will take a long time to master. Brilliant game. If you like twin stick shooters this might float your boat.			"

												Pros:Pretty damn fun.Feels difficult, but generally without feeling unfair.Looks cool.Controller support is great, best way to play.Cons:No rebinding. I'd like to bind the bomb and slomo buttons to the buttons instead of the triggers, but I can't.A few of the game modes feel a little unnecessary.Should probably have some kind of gun upgrades or something, it'd spice the game up and give it a lot more replay value, without it, this game gets old a lot faster than other similar games.Pausing is really funky. You can't pause while you're respawning, a process that takes like 5 seconds, an annoyingly long time if you've gotten a bad start to survival mode or something and just wanna restart. And to further the frustration, the menu takes a little too long to come up, and if you're trying to pause in a hurry and aren't sure it came up, you may accidentally unpause it by hitting it again. In a fast-paced game like this, pauses NEED to be instantaneous, nothing feels worse than dying because you were trying to pause.But, it's $5, which ain't too bad, so unless any of those things are a dealbreaker, I still recommend it. Good few hours of fun to be had here. If they add more weapons/guns/bullets or whatever, and maybe some gamemodes that aren't just bouncing around a circle, like an actual map, then it's a must have.			"

												Well, its not often you stumble across games such as this, a gem of an indie which is both gorgeous to look at and ridiculously addictive. The basic concept is a two stick arcade / high score / challenge type affair, guiding your ball across the 'waves' and defeating various enemies to achieve combo's and bombs. The urge to keep beating that high score keeps the replayability of this game right up there, aside from your usual 'survival' mode there are other game modes such as challenges, bomb runs etc.All in all, well worth the money and will be one of those games you return to time and time again...worthy of note is the chiptune soundtrack which accompanies this game is pretty sweet as well!

												Waves is a twin stick shooter that cost be 99 cents, and it was worth so much more. A simply and very well designed game Waves has you moving and shooting in all directions to destroy brightly coloured balls and shapes. There are a variety of game modes which are all fun and engaging, my personal favourite being Challenge, Survival and Bomb Run. This game is very hard in stages but it’s never frustrating, if you die it’s your fault, not hardware, making you even more determined to beat your last high score, or the scores of your friends. Not to mention the dry wit and humor in the instructions and end game screens is hilarious and well worth a few dollars. If you can get a few friends to play against even more so. The visuals, music and gameplay are spot on and it's a great little time sink that I highly reccomend. A word of warning however, this game is MUCH easier and fun with a controler, rather than a keyboard.			"

												I quickly grew to like this game and the subtle variations in play modes.  The scoring is well done and visually its appealing.  The ample number of achievements have been satisfying to complete.  The interface allows for easy navigation and there are plenty of options.  One minor omission is the inclusion of auto-fire, especially since there is no restriction on the amount of ammunition shot.  I have no major complaints with the game itself however it does leave me with cramps from the rapid mouse movements needed to spray the hordes of nasties. 7/10			"

												This game reminds me of an old Mac game, the title of which escapes me right now, but maybe Dr. Z? Either way, you operated as a lone survivor in a room and had to kill off wave after wave of zombies. it was simple, but addicting. Waves takes that theme to another level by adding a variety of enemy types and what I assume is predictive 'boss' group spawns depending on how much you move around. It will also destroy your WASD keys and give you multiple heart conditions. 10/10 would recommend.			"

												Waves is a modern take on the classic space shooter arcade games of the 80's. In Waves you'll find that the controls are very easy to pick up and that the gameplay has a nice casual feel to it. The graphics and colors in Waves give it a fun and attractive look/feel. With each level of Waves comes more challenging enemies charging at you, more bright explosions, and more intensity to the gameplay; all the while maintaining a simple core concept of flying around shooting enemies in outter space. A few other nice things about Waves are: a fun sountrack, bits of humor hidden in the game, a handful of different game modes, and loads of steam achievements. I'd highly recommend this game to fans of twin-stick shooters or to those looking for a fun game that can easily be picked up for a few minutes at a time.			"

												God help you. God help you all. That drug addiction you kicked? A nervous tic. If your friends describe you as the poster child for addictive personalities, then just click away and save yourself the glorious, swarming, bullet-hell-esque heart ache.I won't keep hitting you with vague hyperboles, but you need to check this out while getting it is easy. The value you're getting out of this game for $0.99 is stupid. It's simple, but visually it's surprisingly attractive, and there are several game modes to suit your play style. Perhaps the most accurate way I can paint an image for you is by drawing a parallel with Super Meatboy. It's lacks any sort of story depth that Super Meatboy may have, but it has that same lightning-fast, razor's edge pace that demands every ounce of attention you can possibly wring from your brain. That exhilerating feeling of only barely being able to keep up, and the highly rewarding feeling of pulling of a sick run.Minimal, highly arcade, highly retro with cutting-edge PhysX graphics. Get this while it's on sale. Seriously. There is not another game on Steam as of this date that is a better buy for $0.99. If you're reading this later, I feel like it may well be worth the regular $5.00 price tag.			"

												My hands hurt as I dodge right and swing down the screen, my gun swinging in the opposite direction as I take out the swarm of yellow at close range. In the clear but if I'm going to keep my multiplier I can't dawdle. I veer off towards a growing cluster of explosive death, hitting slow motion to dart between two oncoming enemies. Bomb ready, but if I just hold off for a few moments longer... oh crap. At the heart of Waves is managing the risk-reward ratio. You can take the game at your own pace, but only by pushing yourself to your limits will you achieve your best scores. In doing so it manages to avoid the frustrating ‘brick-wall’ that can hamper many other dual-stick shooters. Dying is more often a result of you misjudging your own skill, than it is the game throwing more at you than you can handle, and very rarely a result of anything ‘unfair.’ While as the genre-name suggests Waves works much better with a gamepad, I’ve found it is easily playable with a keyboard and mouse, albeit at the expense of finer movement control. The game provides six different game modes, which serve to shift the balance of different elements of the gameplay. Survival, Rush and Crunch Time alter the balance between the need for speed, power and survivability; Bombing Run and Chase require you to move quickly from one target on the arena to another, favouring those with manoeuvrability and path-finding skills. Finally challenge mode is all about accuracy, and conserving your shots for maximal efficiency. Waves is the first dual stick shooter that has really managed to capture my attention, managing to deliver on ‘easy to learn, hard to master,’ without sticking a vertical cliff in the difficulty curve.

												This game rips off quite a lot  from Geometry Wars, but I wouldn't say that's inherently a bad thing. Geometry Wars is a damn good game, and honestly I think Waves is a far better game.A lot of that sentiment comes from how Waves differs from Geometry Wars in terms of its more nuanced mechanics. While both are minimalist twin-stick shooters with similar art directions (though not identical, since Waves uses 3D models), Waves and Geometry Wars have fairly different ways in which they handle their score multipliers and bombs. Waves also has a bullet-time mechanic that's based on a meter you fill as you destroy enemies, and enemies you kill while slowed down net you a point bonus. You can also get point bonuses from destroying enemies at point blank, in which you have a circle around your ship that shows you the radius enemy ships have to be within in order to get the point blank bonus. Overall I just prefer the mechanics in Waves over Geometry Wars.I haven't played Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2, but from what I've read about it Waves it at least on par as they both offer a good handful of game modes that the original game does not have. Some modes in Waves are pretty much identical to ones in Retro Evolved 2 (Waves' ""Crunch Time"" and RE2's ""Deadline"" operate on the same principle of scoring as high as you can on a time limit), others are mostly similar with a few added wrinkles that slightly change how it plays (""Bombing Run"" in Waves plays much like RE2's ""Pacifism"", but with the added quirk of having to deliver a bomb to a specific point on the map before the bomb detontates on yourself, losing a life in the process). Meanwhile the ""Chase"" and ""Rush"" modes in Waves not like any modes in Retro Evolved 2 (funnily enough, the only mode in RE2 that Waves doesn't have an equivalent for is, in fact, called ""Waves"").Sadly, Retro Evolved 2 isn't available on PC. I don't feel too terribly sad about that, however, as Waves is a fantastic alternative. I can totally respect a developer who decides that they want to make a game that's *ahem* ""heavily inspired"" by an existing title, but then they aspire to make it just as good or possibly even better than the game they're ripping off. Also, the soundtrack has a track in it that samples Kefka's iconic laugh from Final Fantasy VI. I just can't argue against something like that.			"

												I've had Waves sitting in my library for some time now, but have only recently gotten around to giving it a solid go. Waves offers up a fairly simple arcade arena shooter. You might associate ""simple"" with some sort of negative - not at all. The mechanics on offer here all gel well together to create something that you can pick up for a short playthrough and have a great time.It would be amazing to see a multiplayer (co-op) mode and see how far you and a friend could get. Given the various game modes on offer, I can imagine some interesting co-op mechanics to keep the pace going.As it stands, this is a fun little shooter that is perfect to pick up when you have a few minutes of down time.

												Waves is a twin stick shooter that cost be 99 cents, and it was worth so much more. A simply and very well designed game Waves has you moving and shooting in all directions to destroy brightly coloured balls and shapes. There are a variety of game modes which are all fun and engaging, my personal favourite being Challenge, Survival and Bomb Run. This game is very hard in stages but it’s never frustrating, if you die it’s your fault, not hardware, making you even more determined to beat your last high score, or the scores of your friends. Not to mention the dry wit and humor in the instructions and end game screens is hilarious and well worth a few dollars. If you can get a few friends to play against even more so. The visuals, music and gameplay are spot on and it's a great little time sink that I highly reccomend. A word of warning however, this game is MUCH easier and fun with a controler, rather than a keyboard.			"

												I quickly grew to like this game and the subtle variations in play modes.  The scoring is well done and visually its appealing.  The ample number of achievements have been satisfying to complete.  The interface allows for easy navigation and there are plenty of options.  One minor omission is the inclusion of auto-fire, especially since there is no restriction on the amount of ammunition shot.  I have no major complaints with the game itself however it does leave me with cramps from the rapid mouse movements needed to spray the hordes of nasties. 7/10			"

												Okay, this is nothing short of amazing.  It's a Williams game - Defender, Tempest, Robotron 2084.  It's pure evil, and it wants to hurt you.  Probably laugh while it's doing it, too.Gorgeous graphics, an excellent selection of very different gameplay modes (an unexpected and very welcome touch!).  This has one-more-go hard-wired into its DNA.  It's brutally addictive.The graphics, though lush and lovely, never get in the way of what's going on.  The colours do trick you sometimes.  You think you're heading for a green bomb pad, but no, it's a virus cluster of nearly the same shade.Slo-mo helps, but is in short supply.  The bomb mechanic takes some getting used to and doesn't always work.  One time, the voice started saying 'Bomb ready', but the combo had dropped (and with it, the bomb) before she'd even said the two words.I paid 79p for this game.  Honestly, if that decimal place had been moved two places to the right, I still would have thought I got a brilliant bargain.Can't recommend it highly enough.			"

												Waves has a surprising number of different gaming modes.  Only after playing it for a few days, I have my favorites and find the entire game quite addicting.  The more I play, the better I get and the more I want to play.  I have a controller and find the controls very smooth.  The in game tools at your disposal are limited (Slow-Mo and bomb), but are very useful and affective.  Both have saved my life numerous times.  As you level up, you have a chance to get a score multiplier.  I really hate when it disappears before I can grab it, but it does add some difficulty to the game.  I purchased this game when it was on sale, but it's definately worth the full price.			"

												Waves is a modern take on the classic space shooter arcade games of the 80's. In Waves you'll find that the controls are very easy to pick up and that the gameplay has a nice casual feel to it. The graphics and colors in Waves give it a fun and attractive look/feel. With each level of Waves comes more challenging enemies charging at you, more bright explosions, and more intensity to the gameplay; all the while maintaining a simple core concept of flying around shooting enemies in outter space. A few other nice things about Waves are: a fun sountrack, bits of humor hidden in the game, a handful of different game modes, and loads of steam achievements. I'd highly recommend this game to fans of twin-stick shooters or to those looking for a fun game that can easily be picked up for a few minutes at a time.			"

												God help you. God help you all. That drug addiction you kicked? A nervous tic. If your friends describe you as the poster child for addictive personalities, then just click away and save yourself the glorious, swarming, bullet-hell-esque heart ache.I won't keep hitting you with vague hyperboles, but you need to check this out while getting it is easy. The value you're getting out of this game for $0.99 is stupid. It's simple, but visually it's surprisingly attractive, and there are several game modes to suit your play style. Perhaps the most accurate way I can paint an image for you is by drawing a parallel with Super Meatboy. It's lacks any sort of story depth that Super Meatboy may have, but it has that same lightning-fast, razor's edge pace that demands every ounce of attention you can possibly wring from your brain. That exhilerating feeling of only barely being able to keep up, and the highly rewarding feeling of pulling of a sick run.Minimal, highly arcade, highly retro with cutting-edge PhysX graphics. Get this while it's on sale. Seriously. There is not another game on Steam as of this date that is a better buy for $0.99. If you're reading this later, I feel like it may well be worth the regular $5.00 price tag.			"

												This game is a shoot-em-up for those who don't care for auto-scrolling. You have full control of your character, a rolling ball, and disaster or salvation is completely in your control... At least, as much as it can be with enemies coming in from all sides. Colors are bright and vivid, and this game's demo is worth trying out to at least get a feel for how your computer will run it. Other than achievements and scoreboards, though, there's not much to keep people hanging in. No story to speak of - just stay alive.

It adds a bullet time feature for those flow-destroying tight spots, but it doesn't seem as claustrofobic as Geometry Wars; The enemy count goes up much, much slower and there doesn't seem to be any enemies designed to disrupt the player's routine. Even the Kudzu-style growths can easily be blasted through. The boss cube seems to be the only enemy type that needs to be avoided.			"

Waves isn't reinventing the wheel, but it does over some original game types, 6 or 7 in total.   Ive purchased it at $1.99, and have seen it at the price several times, it's every bit of worth that price.  It's usually $5, I believe.  After playing it, I would have spent the $5.Rating based on Gameplay and Replayability. 8.2/10			"

												This game rips off quite a lot  from Geometry Wars, but I wouldn't say that's inherently a bad thing. Geometry Wars is a damn good game, and honestly I think Waves is a far better game.A lot of that sentiment comes from how Waves differs from Geometry Wars in terms of its more nuanced mechanics. While both are minimalist twin-stick shooters with similar art directions (though not identical, since Waves uses 3D models), Waves and Geometry Wars have fairly different ways in which they handle their score multipliers and bombs. Waves also has a bullet-time mechanic that's based on a meter you fill as you destroy enemies, and enemies you kill while slowed down net you a point bonus. You can also get point bonuses from destroying enemies at point blank, in which you have a circle around your ship that shows you the radius enemy ships have to be within in order to get the point blank bonus. Overall I just prefer the mechanics in Waves over Geometry Wars.I haven't played Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2, but from what I've read about it Waves it at least on par as they both offer a good handful of game modes that the original game does not have. Some modes in Waves are pretty much identical to ones in Retro Evolved 2 (Waves' ""Crunch Time"" and RE2's ""Deadline"" operate on the same principle of scoring as high as you can on a time limit), others are mostly similar with a few added wrinkles that slightly change how it plays (""Bombing Run"" in Waves plays much like RE2's ""Pacifism"", but with the added quirk of having to deliver a bomb to a specific point on the map before the bomb detontates on yourself, losing a life in the process). Meanwhile the ""Chase"" and ""Rush"" modes in Waves not like any modes in Retro Evolved 2 (funnily enough, the only mode in RE2 that Waves doesn't have an equivalent for is, in fact, called ""Waves"").Sadly, Retro Evolved 2 isn't available on PC. I don't feel too terribly sad about that, however, as Waves is a fantastic alternative. I can totally respect a developer who decides that they want to make a game that's *ahem* ""heavily inspired"" by an existing title, but then they aspire to make it just as good or possibly even better than the game they're ripping off. Also, the soundtrack has a track in it that samples Kefka's iconic laugh from Final Fantasy VI. I just can't argue against something like that.			"

												This game is at least a 9/10. If you have ever enjoyed a twinstick, buy it. Rest assured, this is such a well designed game, slick movement, beautiful graphics that don't impede your ability to read the arena and a really aggression oriented scoring system. There's no messing about, just bomb everything. It's not when to use the bomb, its maneuvering into the perfect position before it times out, hitting slomo and detonating it. Getting into the lizard brain zen state in Waves is awesome, I haven't played them all but this has to be the best twin stick you can get, if someone has a better one PM me now.			"

												This game is fantastic. I bought this hoping it was similar to geometry wars and it completely blew me away. I love the different game modes that you are able to play. Slowing down time is also a pretty cool feature and allows you to escape without using a bomb. If youre a fan of geometry this is a must!			"

												A lightshow of a twinstick shooter, set within a round arena, The game typically plays like Geometry Wars, but takes the best from all the Geometry Wars clones over the years and even the bomb chainreaction gameplay from Every Extend and multipliers when you destroy multiple enemies with one shot. There's also a slow mo feature which you have to keep full to use, again, by destroying more enemies in sucession.  The game has it's own flashy 3D style, a very short soundtrack and multiple game modes. There isn't any real incentive to play this game but beating scores and no real level progression, just one arena until you lose all lives/time, unless you play the other modes.A pretty damn good twinstick shooter. Squid in a box is one to look out for.			"

												I rate the game Waves 3/5. Ok. This game has no bugs and interesting, cool, futuristic Tron Legacy styled graphics. Unfortunately too much of this game is style and far too little of this little game is substance. Remember the old 1980's arcade game Robotron? This is a less fun, less complex version of of that game with less interesting graphics. I'm happy I paid only 1.08 for this game instead of 5.00 as a result. The goal is to shoot stuff and earn points. A good game for a few minutes but extremely boring after 10 minutes. Ultimately Mediocre. Interesting sounds but they also quickly become repetitious.			"

												A spiritual sequel to the Geometry Wars games. It adds a bullet time feature for those flow-destroying tight spots, but it doesn't seem as claustrofobic as Geometry Wars; The enemy count goes up much, much slower and there doesn't seem to be any enemies designed to disrupt the player's routine. Even the Kudzu-style growths can easily be blasted through. The boss cube seems to be the only enemy type that needs to be avoided.			"

												What I like best about this game is that the laser weapon is not something to make the game easier but is something to give you a diiferent experience. The bullet gun uses spread fire to quickly & efficiently take out enemies but can sometimes miss. The laser is able to quickly move across enemies eliminating most in quick sucsession, however it sometimes can not penetrate the entire enemy or moves too fast across it. So you see each weapon has advantages & disadvantages. Not many top down shooters like this are that generous. Plus the graphics & gameplay are fanatastic.			"

The different gamemodes are delightfully hard and enjoyable all round. 9/10 would get my face eaten by a giant cube again			"

												OK, here is the test for whether you should get this game. Go play some free twin-stick shooter, like Echoes. Did you like it? Then you're going to ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. The controls are awesome and tight. The enemies are all interesting and unique. But the coolest part is the mechanics. The 4 moves are: Move, shoot, bomb, and slow down time. The first two are self explanitary, after a ten hit combo you have a second to activate a bomb, and you slowly charge a buffer, that can slow down time and get you double points while you do so 'because it looks awesome'. Oh, and you also get double points for shooting enemies at point blank 'because it looks awesome'. This game is awesome.			"

												Waves is a modern take on the classic space shooter arcade games of the 80's. In Waves you'll find that the controls are very easy to pick up and that the gameplay has a nice casual feel to it. The graphics and colors in Waves give it a fun and attractive look/feel. With each level of Waves comes more challenging enemies charging at you, more bright explosions, and more intensity to the gameplay; all the while maintaining a simple core concept of flying around shooting enemies in outter space. A few other nice things about Waves are: a fun sountrack, bits of humor hidden in the game, a handful of different game modes, and loads of steam achievements. I'd highly recommend this game to fans of twin-stick shooters or to those looking for a fun game that can easily be picked up for a few minutes at a time.			"

												This game is addictive, I mean seriously addictive! Once you start playing you will have to find a way to force yourself to stop or you will be playing the whole day. Its a classic top-down / shoot-em-up survival game (Like crimsonland). The achievements are truly challenging to get but the sense of reward at the end is really amazing, you feel like you've climbed a mountain, fell down 60 of 65 times, given up 4 times and finally succeeded the last time, then you go back for more.I recommend this game to anyone who likes to have their heart pounding in their throat, I have one suggestion to make in regards to this. The game dev's should occasionally clear the highscore board, cause seeing the numbers there could discourage a lot of players(Specially after counterstop)Game is a 9/10 for me, the lack of different weapons is the only thing that really brings it down, but the rest of the game is 5-star quality!

												Good, simple, arcadey fun.  I have to make the inevitable comparison to Geometry Wars, which is plays very similarly to.  Where that game has more diverse enemies, this one has more diverse game modes.  Also, where Geometry Wars's control scheme really was optimized for dual analog sticks, Waves plays just as well with a mouse & keyboard.			"

												Waves is a game very much in the same mold as Geometry Wars: you control a little abstract gun platform and you move and shoot in twin stick fashion with the left stick moving and right stick aiming and shooting.  Like most games of this ilk the fun is in the relentless and frenetic action of the unceasing hordes that home in on you and the satisfaction comes from the ""dodging raindrops"" finesse you acquire when ""in the zone"".  There's even a charging bullet time effect to help you out in a pinch. As a bonus there's some extra game modes available, but the primary action is the best.  There's a trippy electronica soundtrack and a lot of glitzy effects to go with the excellent color palette choices.My only beef is that there's not an escalating sense of your own lethality which means the climb in intensity levels off and you just continue fending off the frenzy, which while fun can lead to weariness if you're able to pull off a long survival streak.  Other than that it's a delight!			"

												Waves is a fixed map style shooter that is the most fun game in the genre that I've played since 1987's Crystal Quest.Waves describes itself as ""accessible"" and that label is absolutely spot on. Waves never aggravates with its gameplay and never frustrates with any part of its implementation. It is beautiful, runs at high resolutions, and was clearly built for play on a computer.Waves boasts a Matrix / Max Payne bullet time buffer that can be tapped to get the player out of a bind. Bombs and clustering virus cells round out the experience.Waves' multiple game modes all feel like peers rather than second class additions to a primary mode, and each are fun and varied.			"

												Pretty cool, small little game.  The basic idea is that you are ball that rolls around shooting other objects to get score.  Had several game modes and all of them were decent.Very colorful and easy to control, and if you get a combo of 10 hits quicky - you get a bomb to use to lose.... but I did wish that there was ""random"" powerups - the bomb is the only power up.  You do level up, but I never noticed what leveling up does.  Good little game, I played a little under an hour and got 16 achievements.  If you love bullet hell style games, you might like this since the twist isn't bullets but instead so many enemies.			"

												Waves (commonly misread as: Woves) is a twin-stick shooter for people who respect games with names like Geometry Wars. Comparisons to Bizarre's legendary shooter notwithstanding, Waves is about as good as it gets for twin-stickery on the PC and if you have a thing for aggressive geometry, leaderboards and some ridiculous menu tips then Waves may just be your thing.

												A fun small twinstick shooter.Simple yet intuitive mechanics, unique graphics and a good soundtrack. Perfect for some minutes gaming or to relax, though there are still multiple gamemodi so it doesn't get boring aso fast (especially because of the achievements).The enemies are very fun, some spread like viruses and some dogde your shots, it is enjoyable that the longer you play the harder and interesting the enemies become.Only downpoints is no story, no multiplayer and maybe that sometimes it feels a tiny bit random, but that's a problem of all twinstick shooters I think :P			"

												Waves is a bright and hectic twin stick shooter with many similarities to Super Stardust HD and Everyday Shooter (except with smoother controls) It is crafted to the point of a perfect arcade style game, where a player's failure or success is purely based on his or her skill and not cheap deaths. Easy to play for casual gamers, challenging enough for hardcore gamers. Multiple game modes to whet your appetite, though I prefer Bombing Run (no gun, one shield and bomb per red pad collected in 10 second time) and Chase (get to the red pad before time is out). Rush and Survival are also extremely fun. The soundtrack, composed by Smiletron (who has made alot of great electronic music) is an absolute wonder to hear, as it causes a near trance-like state when playing the game at high volumes with a good sound system - I was deeply immersed in this computer word when this chiptuney music was playing over the rave club-like techno bass. Having a subwoofer/surround system or really good headphones makes a huge difference.Waves is my favorite multidirectional shmup of all time and I intend to keep it permanently installed to go back to on occasion. Get this game, so Squid in a Box can fund their next project.			"

												This game is addictive, I mean seriously addictive! Once you start playing you will have to find a way to force yourself to stop or you will be playing the whole day. Its a classic top-down / shoot-em-up survival game (Like crimsonland). The achievements are truly challenging to get but the sense of reward at the end is really amazing, you feel like you've climbed a mountain, fell down 60 of 65 times, given up 4 times and finally succeeded the last time, then you go back for more.I recommend this game to anyone who likes to have their heart pounding in their throat, I have one suggestion to make in regards to this. The game dev's should occasionally clear the highscore board, cause seeing the numbers there could discourage a lot of players(Specially after counterstop)Game is a 9/10 for me, the lack of different weapons is the only thing that really brings it down, but the rest of the game is 5-star quality!

												Just a solid and maybe underrated twin-stick shooter on Steam.  Akin to Geometry Wars in its retro/minimalist visual style and game play.  I especially like the Crunch Time mode where you have 3 minutes to score as many points as possible.  The dynamic scoring system adds another layer for optimal high scoring tactics.Comparing your high scores in game with friends is adds to the competitive fun.Runs at ~30 fps on my low end AMD A6-5200 APU laptop with the visuals set to low.  Also in my opinion, an Xbox or similar controller is highly recommended.			"
