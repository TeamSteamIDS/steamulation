												The last truly great Battlefield.Back when they released maps for free.Didn't sell DLC before the game was even released yet.The only DLC they had changed the entire battlefield into a different era with different maps, weapons, etc. Don't you guys think BF: Hardline should've just been a DLC instead of a $60 game?  Aspect Rating   Sound Design Perfect   Class System Almost Perfect   Destruction Sublime   Graphics Amazing Played for countless hours on my xbox, got this on PC and was pleased to see a relatively active community. Sadly enough, playing BF4 and coming back to this just makes me like BF:BC2 even more. It's the best and you need to get it.			"

Battlefield: Bad Company 2  Field Rating Review   Graphics 9 A beautifully rendered world, extremely satisfying levels of destruction, grand animations, and an easy to understand interface. Battlefield: Bad Company 2 has it all.   Gameplay 9 At times, it feels like there are some frustrating balance issues. But those are few and far between. Bad Company 2 is a fantastic game to pick up and go to town with. You'll find glee in causing buildings to crumble around you, planting that charge of C4 on a tank and blowing it up, nailing that perfect headshot from across the map. However, where Bad Company 2 really shines is when you log on with some friends and get coordinated. Communicate and work together to outgun, outflank, and outdo the enemy team.   Story 4 I'll be honest with you. If you are playing Battlefield games for the story, you're going to be really, really disappointed. While there is a storymode here, it honestly isn't worth much of your time except as a glorified tutorial. The characters do give a few good laughs though.   Multiplayer 10 As mentioned earlier, Bad Company 2 really shines when you play with friends, but even alone you're going to have a blast with this one. Hours and hours of fun and destruction await you, with several different modes of multiplayer available to choose from. Be warned though, if you join up this late in the game you're going to face some very, very good long-time players.   Replayability 9 You're going to keep coming back to this one. The peak of the Battlefield series so far, it never gets old racing out of a building as it crumbles around you, covering your team on a withdrawal from an overrun area, or being at the front of a charge to capture a point. Don't miss out on one of the most enjoyable Battlefield experiences yet. The only struggle here is that most your friends will probably have moved on to the new battlefields.   Overall 9.2/10 Though not as popular as it once was (due to the new battlefields) Bad Company 2 still stands at the top of the Battlefield mountain. The Frostbite engine really shines in this iteration. Multiplayer is fast-paced, brutal, and spectacularly fun. Don't like those trees? Mow them down with your LMG. Don't like that building? Blow it up. Your team being overrun? Call in an artillery strike and give them some relief. All in all, an absolute must have for any Battlefield fan.

												Battlefield : Bad Company 2 might be the only current-gen/next-gen Battlefield game to not be stained by EA greediness. Just wait before the franchise turns into a free-to-play game with microtransactions and before it invades the Android platform.The community is still active even nowadays. And yet the game is still the most overlooked Battlefield of the franchise.PROS :+Very arcadish gameplay that features unrealistic shooting mechanics and lots of destroyable buildings+Doesn't require Origin to play+Ingame servers browser and matchmaking system (no web browsing à la BF3 BF4)+No premium account, season pass or whatever you call it+No multiplayer map packs à la Call of Duty, feels like a complete game by itself+No unlock purchase+A fun singleplayer campaign (not excellent but nonetheless good)+One amazing DLC that feels like a Total Conversion or a reskin of Battlefield in the Vietnam War eraCONS :-No 64 players maps-No option to change the narrow field of view (default 65) except in the .ini document-Unlike Battlefield 2, Bad Company 2 features no mod-Bad Company 2 Vietnam servers are almost empty (if you're lucky you may find two active servers)Old doesn't mean obsolete!Forget about Battlefield 3 and 4 and be part of the Bad Company!P.S.: Don't mistake me. BF3 and BF4 are quite fun. I just dislike the marketing philosophy behind it. I haven't played BF Hardline yet so I can't say anything about it.Rating :9.0			"

BEST BUY EVER! AND STILL POPULATED! (20-100 full servers at all times! NA - Eu/Russia - Oceania)Bought it 3 times:- Disk: 20€- Steam: 2.5€- Origin: 2€Time in-game > 3000 hours:- Disk: +- 2500h- Steam: 350h- Origin: 350h The SPNot that important to me, but even so I finished it three times (2x normal and 1x hard). I thought the chars were pretty great, certainly had a few laughs. The gameplay was OK, but like I said I'm not really a sp kinda guy.Pros (Multiplayer)+++ The gameplay is just... really this game has a soul people!! The feeling guys, it's amazing :D++ Brilliant map design. (flanking possibilities etc)++ Huge terrain variation. (jungle/ snow and desert)++ Almost everything is destructable. ++ Class system is great and rewards teamplay!++ Separate level and class unlocks.++ Vehicles are fun and rewarding when mastered but still balanced.++ Does not force battlelog or origin on its users.++ It can be soooooo much fun :D++ It goes on sale for 2.5€.... seriously?+ You can change FOV in settings file.+ Decent amount of graphical options.+ Imo the graphics (maxed out) beat a lot of 2014 titles to it.+ Requirements are pretty low.+ Never had issues that couldn't be easily fixed (like crashes etc).+ I found the amount of attachements a bit overwhelming in bf3, not the case here.Cons (Multiplayer)-- The hitreg isn't always as it should be.-- The community (players). Many of the players play like total scrubs and talk♥♥♥♥♥♥all day long.-- The community (admins). If you're a decent player, they might kick/ ban you from their server.-- Some balancing issues with weapons like mg36, explosive perks, autoshotguns and shotgun slugs.- Level unlocks only last till lvl 22.- There are some hackers. 1/40 rounds or so. (people who claim there are cheaters in every round have no idea what they're talking about)Conclusion:This game is amazing. The graphics and gameplay create such a unique atmosphere, I can keep playing it for hours and hours and just keep coming back for more. The only reasons why I don't play it 24/7 are the hitreg and the community. It's only 5€, seriously guys what are you waiting for :D!!Note for new players - It all comes down to one simple question really:Do you like spreading your cheeks and getting farmed/ baseraped by better players?Yes --> snipe from your main or use improved demolitions on 40mm/ rpgs, use chat to vent your rage, don't drop ammo/heals or repair vehicles, don't join squads, connect to 32 slots fast respawn (preferably hardcore) servers.No --> Use your primary weapon + pistol (+ magnum ammo perk - lvl 15), play the objective, use your audio, support your team, flank and backstab, change your FOV in the settings file, play on low ping 24 slots servers (no hardcore) , play SQUAD RUSH/ conquest/ rush, try playing with friends.  You will still get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but less frequently and you might even have fun.Respectable players --> don't use autoshotguns, mg36, mortars, rpgs/40mm tube on players, long range shotgun or improved demolitions perk.--Edit-- : How to find populated servers. (Since you asked)1. Boot the game.2. Click 'Login'. (right - center)3. Enter Email and PW of your EA account.-->Some people can't login when the boxes for remember PW/ Auto login are checked.4.

To rank the found servers according to population click on the 'Players' tab (center - right).--Edit--: Best way to register your CD key and prevent problems in mp! 1. Buy BC2 on steam.2.

Feel the battlefield with Battlefield™A review and recommandation of ""Battlefield: Bad Company™ 2""I spend a long time with this game. When I was ill, with good or bad mood. I played this. And? It was worth it.In no other game (accept Call of Duty) you will need so long to reach the motherfu*king top - General of the Army. 280 hours (for me)The historical background is the Cold War between the United States of America and Russia. That is the campaign. Very simple.To the facts!++ many people play it++ huge arsenal of weapons and vehicles++ realistic++ the best sounds (weapon etc.) I ever heard!++ nice explosions!++ nice map design++ maps and game modes - big variation++ awesome graphics+ everbody can play this - tactics, camper, rambos etc.+ the campaign is ok+ gameplay is smooth and fast+ every weapon has dis- and advantages+ normal sized maps (not like in BF3)+ don't rush - play with tactic+ no arena shooter (like Call of Duty)+ earn dogtags by killing an enemy with the knife...hihihiYes. Also BF:BC 2 has a dark side... not really- EA- many ""pros"" and camper are playing this now- many children play this..with a microphone- ruined my life- often connecting problems or problems with ""PunkBuster""- it isn't easy at the beginning, but you will find inIn my opinion it is the BEST Battlefield in history! Everything you want in a shooter is in this game! For 5€ or 20€ you can buy this. Please. I swear you will love this game! You can't make anything wrong.It is like a present from God, Buddha, Spongebob, Putin and Batman together.Join the Battlefield: ->  9,5/10 "

												10/10 Amazing game with amazing gunplay. Real high replay value aswell, i always come back to the game quite frequent for the amazing multiplayer experience that it has to offer. I highly recommend any FPS fan to get this game, you will not be dissapointed. The game is of course a bit old so the game is no longer supported, so somethings may still be a bit annoying/buggy like for example the ""zoom out while ADS(aiming down sight)"" which can be annoying. But overall its fairly balanced(except for the OP Saiga 12). So i'd suggest you get the game, either if its on Steam or Origin. I'd recommend Origin since its cheaper there(price depends on where you live, for example in Norway its cheaper on Origin and more expensive on Steam, but its the same price on both Steam and Origin in the US).

												This is a review of an old game but i've been getting back in to it as it's still active. The only Battlefield game on Steam but also the best.The good - - The guns feel powerful and fun to use and sound so loud and scary you'd think satan was farting in your ears.- A♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of weapons and gadgets to unlock.- Fun single player with likeable, memorable characters. Everyone remembers Sweetwater and Haggard, who honestly remembers the names of shouty marine #2 and #3 from the other BF games?- Destructible cover, walls and buildings  gives you so many different ways to play and works a lot better than in later BF games. In Bad Company 2 you can level whole buildings and laugh like a maniac as enemy players are crushed to death inside whereas in BF3 and 4 you can mostly only blow holes in (some) walls.- Doesn't require Origin to play!!!!!!!!!!!!!!- When the♥♥♥♥♥♥really kicks off there is nothing else like it on PC.- The sniper class looks like Chewbacca. The bad:- You can't go prone which is a little annoying in some situations but no one else can go prone either so it's no biggie.- You unlock magnum ammo at rank 15 which increases your weapon damage by 25%. It's pretty dumb and pointless, you will suffer many unfair deaths until you unlock it.- That's about it. Play this game and rock out with your♥♥♥♥♥♥out.			"

Taken 27/06/2016 (Steam summer sale 2016)Now that's out of the way, you can buy this game. Cause it's awesome.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For those looking for an actual review..MULTIPLAYER: For me, and quite a few people it seems, this is the best battlefield released to date. It's the most fun and most well made addition to the series and I think it's down to the simplicity of it's loadout system, as well as the great team and game play, and of course the destruction that every one loves. When you jump onto Battlefield 4, I feel its too complex for its own good. way to many class options and quite a few flawed items that became over powered (Especially a lot of the DLC weapons and gadgets that they released) BC2 gives you a good selection of guns and perk options without going overboard. There are one or two things I would maybe change (Magnum rounds and the shotty slug rounds) but everyhting else works well.The maps are really awesome, some better on different modes than others, and some you can only play on certain modes, a bit weird really. But they're all pretty awesome. rush and conquest are the main game modes available, along with squad deathmatch and squad rush, but just stick with rush and conquest. The general gameplay is standard battlefield fare, just awesome. Stuff's blowing up all over the place, soldiers are shouting their heads off about snipers blowing their mates head off, bullets are wizzing past and it combines to make probably, in my opinion, the most cinematic war experience ever made for a multiplayer game. Some people will be craving jet gameplay and the more varied vehicles that BF3 and BF4 have, but the ones available are all you need. Unfortunatley though there are no jets, for those that didn't know.And the audio... it's the best ( And make sure you go into the audio settings and turn on war tapes)SINGLEPLAYER:Decent for one playthrough I guess, played it on the 360 back in the day once and never really went back to it apart for achievements, but it's not the worst campaign ever. Not big, open free roam areas like BC1 had in the singleplayer which is a shame, but the characters and action are interesting enough to keep you interested.So overall:Multiplayer 9.5/10Singleplayer 7/10Audio 11/10The audio's so good...Buy it while it's cheap people.

												// READ //Great game, still my favorite Battlefield to this day. Multiplayer servers are still pretty populated, and it plays exactly as you probably remembered it in the past.Also worth noting, there are a few people giving this game negative reviews because of servers being empty, and that's mostly why I'm posting this. This is false, while there are no DICE official servers anymore, there are plenty of community servers where everyone plays on. You just have to press the ""search"" button on the server browser and you'll find many to choose from, however clearly this is much too challenging for some Steam users.Also unlike what that one guy said, you can still create a new account for this. It's literally just an EA account so if you already have one you're fine, if not you can easily make a new one and still play.			"

												The greatest FPS I've ever played, and I still play it to this day. Great gameplay, great maps and great balance between classes, weapons and vehicles, nothing is overrated. Though it is from 2010, the graphics still amazes me. Definitely worthy of every buck you spend. Do not worry about the server status, there are still 700 people playing online everyday, so it is not dead. Join us and keep this game alive.			"

												The best multiplatform shooter. Whereas CoD has you sprinting off by yourself, drop-shotting, and camping with some twitch-shoot mechanics. Battlefield encompasses the features that made people play First Person Shooters to begin with -- the feeling of being in a battle. Several factors contribute to this. The graphics are not the best out there, but they're very solid, much better than the first Bad Company which suffered from a grainy effect and low view-distance. Atmospheric effects (sand, debris, smoke) are done brilliantly and are wonderfully varying. One second you can looking down your scope in the desert and see everything laid out clearly. The next, looking in the same exact spot, your vision can be distorted by a rogue burst of wind and sand. The sound quality is even better, arguably unrivaled in gaming. Distant sound occurs a second or two after the event, giving the impression of a larger battle. The campaign is about standard for modern FPSs, which is why I didn't go into detail, but the multiplayer has no equals -- Bad Company really is in its own category.			"

												You're a gamer, so GAMEplay is the most important factor, visual representation is always second, Your brain and imagination can interpolate graphics into something more real than any next gen graphics. The game play is what keeps you playing, not the textures and eyecandy. This game had it. It went downhill after bad company 2 was killed by the ""new"" battlefields that stole its playerbase, just for the fact that it was the ""new"" and everyone wants to try the ""new"" but it doesn't always mean it's better. There are still people playing this, but not in huge numbers which is a shame. It just goes to show that having a saturated market isn't always a good thing.			"

												This game is so important to me, I have atleast 1,000 hours on 360 I'm the max level, and this game after joining the PC master race the DLC give me that ""feeling"" again. Certain games just you have a soft spot for in your heart. This is one of those games, I'm not even going to touch on the fact that The DLC for this game is remarkable. The game is extremely active. You can run around with a M1 Garand and scream ♥♥♥♥ you Kami's and How does that♥♥♥♥♥♥feel!!? This game gives me a disturbing feeling of war, The large maps, the snipers, the vehicles. Like I said before, this game has a ""feeling"" that can't be recreated. It's not a game where you pay for skins or pay for weapons. EA had the right idea when they let the Sweedish DICE make the game. Not forcing DLC and actually making a good game that requires skill and hours of learning. Other Battlefields focus on you as a player, with no prone or TDM this game requires teamwork. Even in 2016 I try and pick up BF3 which I love to death and I'm just not impressed. The graphics and smoothness of the game really is the best out there and all of the thousands that still play understand this. I feel as a player I can jump right in alone and have fun, even though it requires more team than anything. 6 years later it still has some of the best mechanics I have seen in a Multiplayer game. Ever. This is by FAR the most legimate down to earth game, with a action packed campaign to the loaded lobbies of active multiplayer years later. Plus this game is on Flash sale this summer with the game and DLC adding up to around $7.30 You're crazy not to pick this up. Go nab on your moms leg for those Steam wallet funds!			"

Be sure to go to the server browser and click search...you will find multiple servers.  Some have points boost so you can level up weapons faster...now the vietnam dlc is awesome but that doesn't have too many players...too bad because it is one of the best dlc's that dice has ever released.  Let's all start playing the vietnam dlc and bring it back old school style.			"

												This is probably the best battlefield you will ever play. This battlefield was made right before DICE become money hungry s***heads. This battlefield had a ton of work put into it and meaningfull DLC. All the guns are balanced except for the M60, but that made it all the more better. Maps that would take you on a journey or tell a story. A singleplayer campaign that felt more like an Indiana Jones movie, or singleplayer maps that were so huge, you could free roam forever. Not to mention that everything can be completely obliterated. Quick loading screens and can quickly play another game without having to join another server or wait a ridiculous amount of time. And the fact that this battlefield is on Steam and not on a fake rip-off called Origin makes it all the more better. All in all this is probably my favorite battlefield. 10/10.			"

The last Battlefield with full destructionBattlefield: Bad Company 2 holds a special place in my heart. I love Vietnam War movies, games and music and this game just happens to have a Vietnam War expansion pack. It really nails the expansion too. The weapons, the scenarios, maps, music, vehicles...it's all so very well done. The expansion pack is multiplayer only and it's epic!Singleplayer campaign is pretty ""CoD-like"" linear most of the time.  There are some sandboxy areas but for the most of time it's your simple corridor shooter.Make no mistake tho, the campaign is very enjoyable. It's not a serious shooter. It has a bunch of good humour in it, fantastic characters, pwetty graphiczzz and a vast variety of locations: deserts, snowy areas and jungles - I love me some jungles and xmas areas, man.It's about 8 hours long. Nothing special...no replay value, really. But it is fun for what it is and i guess you could go and replay it just for the heck of it.The Multiplayer is why people play Battlefield. Battlefield used to be a multiplayer only game. The first time it had a singleplayer campaign was back in 2007 in Battlefield: Bad Company. That game is a console exclusive tho.So this is actually the first Battlefield game that features a singleplayer campaign on the PC Entertainment System.Multiplayer is just awesome. Everything can be destroyed. Now don't get me wrong, i do love me some BF3 and BF4. I don't hate on them like other ""hardcore"" Battlefield fans. The hate is childish and quite ignorant to be honest. Nothing wrong with Battlefield 4 (it had a bad launch but it's OK now) and Battlefield 3...nothing bad to say about that game...but back to the point: Bad Company 2 lets you blow up everything! In later BFs you can only blow up certain walls or buildings. In here there's no boundaries!Blow up trees, blow up houses, blow boats, blow up water...explosion! EXPLOSION! EXPLOSIOONN!! EXPLOSIOOOOOOONNNNNN!!!! PROMOTEEEEEEED!!!!!Khm, as i was saying, the multiplayer is quite fun. Especially epic with friends but you can do very well when playing alone too.Just like in singleplayer, there are quite a good variety of locations: jungles, forests, xmas, deserts, plain fields. + The Vietnam expansion which adds A LOT to the epicness. Feels like a totally new game.32v32 player multiplayer, 5 people squads - Lots of shooting going on, lots of explosions, lots of raging.4 different classes: revive/heal your teammates, give them ammo or bring down tanks by yourself - Teamwork is rewarded. Don't ignore your teams needs...or ignore them. I'm not your daddy and you're a free kiddo. Do whatever you want in this virtual world of ours.Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is worth every single penny. If you're looking for a massive multiplayer game where you could destroy everything you see...man, look no further! "

												One of the best shooters of its generation.  Bad Company 2 continues in its predecessors' footsteps by creating a progressive and solid first-person shooter.  Instances in which both teams utilize the squad system result in truly breathtaking gameplay.  Also, due to EA's continued fascist business model, Bad Company 2 remains as the preeminent military FPS available on Steam.			"

												Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is a team-based MMOFPS capture-the-checkpoint game based on massive maps. As you may have known, its sucessors are having a huge sucess. Battlefield easily became one of the iconic PC FPS game beside CoD and CSGO. BF: BC2 seriously blew my mind on both gameplay and graphics quality. As a 2010 game, I did not expect much from it. I got this on a massive sale and grabbed a few copies to send to my friends. I tested 3-4 levels of the SP and had some MP matches with my groupmates. Here are the pros and cons I pulled from it:Pros:+ Amazing optimization and graphics quality. Similar to its successors, this game is highly optimized. This means you can run BF games on bottleneck PCs with 60 fps. Graphics quality that is offered with this level of minimum specs are also amazing.+ Classic Battlefield unforgiving & challenging shooting recoil. You can't point-and-shoot with laser-pinpoint accuracy like *cough*Call of Duty*cough*+ Again, similar to its successors, the gameplay keeps a great balance between realism and entertaining arcade system. You can't run around no-scoping people with sniper rifles, but you sure won't get killed with 1 body shot like in Arma 3.+ Servers & community are still active, most of them has x15 XP so you can rank up very quickly to unlock the weapons. A lot of people are still playing this game.+ Bullet drop already exists, not as harsh as BF4 but it poses a challenge to snipers.+ Tons of weapon choices+ Steep, but enjoyable learning curve. Not as harsh as CSGO and not as lean as Call of Duty.+ Definitely fun to play with your friends. Get them into a squad, turn your voice chat on, and go have a blast.+ Perfect game to test the Battlefield experience. If you're afraid your money will go to waste on BF3/BF4/BFH/BF1, try this game first. Although the elements are very different, general gameplay is similar.+ Haven't met any imperious server admins that enforces weird rules like in later BF games.+ Classic BF destructible environmentCons:- Still K/D focused. Players are not really motivated to work with their team and solely focus on their own K/D. Players rarely bothers to capture a point and chose to sit on top of a hill with a sniper rifle instead. - Too many veteran players. Some people simply don't get bored with old games and they stay here for years. Arrogant veterans are squashing new players with helicopters/snipers.- Base♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥is hardly controlled. Veteran players can easily find a sweet spot to camp the freshly spawned players. You basically will not have any chance to fight back if someone does this. Some servers kill these people but they often find loopholes to base♥♥♥♥♥♥e.g. destroying freshly spawned vehicle- I personally don't fancy the shooting. It's a bit wonky and awkward compared to other FPS games. I'm a 16-years FPS veteran that usually learns the pattern of new FPS games very quickly and can gain a headstart. In this particular game, it is very difficult for me to adapt.- Adding friends seem to be very difficult in this game. It took me days and multiple tries to have my friend request sent to my groupmatesIn conclusion, BF: BC2 is definitely worth it.  I wouldn't say that this game is better than its successors since I'm very meticulos with graphical quality and I despise downgrading games that I play. I would choose to play BF4/BF1 all day over BF: BC2.  However, this is an especially great game for people with bare-necessities PC specs or considering to purchase EA Origin's BF1/BF4/BFH. I hope my review can be helpful in your decision.Thank you for reading!			"

												Bad Company 2 easily the best and greatest of the Battlefield titles. The fun this game offers in multiplayer is completely unmatched by any of the other Battefields or Call of Dutys. It's maps are generally tight making the rounds fast and furious, and few vehicles to ruin the fun of it being a first PERSON shooter. The later Battlefields have too much of a vehicle presence. Obviously there are maps that are targeted more at Tank combat, but the infantry play the ruling role. The game is just perfectly balanced. Having said that, there is one underlying thing that Bad Company 2 has that the others do not. Heroes. It's game play rewards heroic and bold play styles. Meaning the entire outcome of the round can sometimes come down to that one person, that one play, that turns the tide of the battle. You may have died in the maneuver, but you made it possible for the rest of your team to punch through.With every new Battlefield released, the numbers in multiplayer drop... But they always. Always, come back to Bad Company 2			"

												Just bought it to play with friends.They also recommended me to not join any modded servers. But i did and got all the items in no time xd.Pros- destructible environment (even more than battlefield 3)- realistic as always- nice graphics (for such an old game)Cons- don't buy the vietnam dlc it seems like nobody ever plays it. So it's not worth itI'll update the review later on when i completed the storyline.Is there a building in your way you blow it like BOOOOOOOOOOOOM! No building and a clear path.			"

PROS:+ cool & cheesy campaign+ nice soundtrack (made fantastic in the Vietnam expansion)+ vehicles are fun+ collectable weapons+ destructible environment+ funny dialogue+ great multiplayer+ still plenty of people in multiplayerCONS:- a bit short campaign- some weapons become useless- enemies always focus fire on you- sand/snow storms blind a bit too much?- EA account needed for multiplayerComment:The logo looks like BF3 which might get people confused. Because, unlike the main BF franchize known for seriousness, Bad Company is lovably goofy. Best way to describe the mood is ""less serious CoD:MW"" mixed with ""a parody of an american action movie"". Unlike the previous Bad Company game we can enjoy this one on the PC too, although it is missing one DLC on the PC (Onslaught expansion which is a multiplayer co-op game mode). We are greeted with a WW2 intro/tutorial mission but the main game is played within a USA vs Russia conflict set in the present. The campaign is cool, fun and it keeps this tone for the most of the game. You will probably find your two or three favourite weapons and play those. First playthrough is good but once you unlock all the weapons you get to choose how you want to play. Which in my case was running around destroying everything with the rocket launcher. Unlike the collectable weapons that unlock for later use (or to have them already when replaying the campaign) the m-com stations serve little purpose than to distract. There could have been perhaps less (or more?) enemies if you find and disable one of these stations ... or at least extra dialogue. Your team buddies can actually kill enemies although the focus stays on you so you don't get bored letting your (immortal) mates do all the work. You all make a stereotypical gang - the smart one with glasses, the tough one, the sarge and the basic/vanilla one which you play. The slightly dated graphics still hold their charm though there are some graphical hick-ups - like tank threads that do not move. And I know it's kind of stupid to say but sand and snow storms hinder your vision a lot more than they maybe should. Because of this you either have to know where your enemy is or you have to be lucky. These storms are also annoying when driving around in vehicles and avoiding cliffs. The multiplayer is a blast and is still one of the best FPS multiplayers (even more if you have the Vietnam expansion). The playerbase is still good so check it out. There are more players in the default multiplayer than the Vietnam expansion but try that out too, it is awesome. Overall this is not a perfect game, it has flaws, but these can be overlooked due to the sheer fun factor of it. Get the bundle!			"

About Battlefield Bad Copany 2	Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is a 2010 first-person shooter video game developed by EA DICE. Released in 2010, this game still outdoes nearly every single other game out of the Battlefield-series, and nearly no-one knows why.The singleplayer is one to be played (though it is a little weird... played it 4 or more times and didn't really understood of what was going on), and the multiplayer has become more than friendly to new players, as there are multiple High-XP-servers on which you can unlock all the weapons within about 3 hours, depending on how you play. You do not need to have Origin started in order to play this game.With the Vietnam DLC, it brings a more historical touch to the game, sadly without a singleplayer campaign, which I imagine would have been the cherry on top of the cake.All in All Battlefield: Bad Company™ 2 is a verry Good first-person Shooter!9/10 From me :-) Sweep "

												Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is a first-person game having both single player and multiplayer modes.In the campaign you play as 1 of 4 U.S. soldiers and complate missions mainly fighting against Russian forces. Over the course of the game you will shoot shotguns, assault rifles, snipers, man turrets and drive vehicles. Personally the story wasn't that interesting to me, but it got kinda better near the end of it.Multiplayer has several gamemodes which you can play. The maps are pretty big allowing for not only infantry combat, but also the presence of tanks, helicopters, ATVs and APCs and that differentiates it from other FPS games. You can choose between 4 classes which each specialise in something. There are usually a couple of servers with players, but most are empty. Sometimes you will get killed by an Apache while at spawn. Vision on lowest graphics at least is kinda bad and the size of the maps doesn't help at all. You can get killed by a hundred different things and you might not even understand what was going on.I'd recommend this game if its on sale.			"

												Having played every Battlefield released on pc I think its fair to say that this is one of the best ever made, it beats its predecessors & following titles on certain points:+No suppression+No premium BS, map packs were free and the (1)! DLC felt like another game (even tho it is poorly balanced)+Good map design, dedicated rush/conquest maps+Gamemodes that make sense: Conquest, Rush, Deathmatch & SQrush. Each of them aiming at another playstyle / skill level +Not so many 'fire and forget' & lock-on weapons+Immersive sound from both map/game/players+Personality: Map progression in rush and characters.+Destruction that matters, unlike in BF3&BF4 you can basically destroy everything+Funny physics: ragdolls all over+Vehicles that take skill to master and to take down-10Tick, so once again pretty bad hitreg.-Basically no recoil on most guns, or easy to control. Which turns some 1v1 fights in sprayfests.-Like every Battlefield this game has some balance issues with guns like the mg36, shotgun slugs and explosive perks for rocket launchers-Community can either be the best one or the worst one ever (rocketspam/noobtubes/lame gameplay/whining)-Badmins: good players arent welcome anymore, you get banned if you win vs admins or if you just play on a level above the casual players.-Graphics are kinda outdated by now but still glorious on high settings. however, low graphics settings gives advantages such as looking through textures.-Obviously no more DICE support			"

												Wow, this game is amazing. Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is truly the best FPS game of it's year. I don't know what about it makes the game so addicting, but somehow DICE really got it right with this game. The multiplayer will keep you playing for hours at a time, with the comic singleplayer as a bonus. I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys FPS games, as this is easily one of the best.

												tl;dr: HIGHLY reccommend getting this game. Ignoring the mediocre campaign and occasional server frustrations, this is probably the best fps I've ever played.Even though I moved to a rural area and can no longer play it's muliplayer, I still regard this game very highly. If you have the money to spare, I can almost guarantee that you won't be disappointed. I have no idea what the servers are like these days, but back when I played it, the minor hiccup with the punkbuster service was overshadowed by the dedicated server support. Even the campaign is a fun playthrough for the first couple of times.What it does right: Where to begin. This is what an fps should feel like. The guns are satisfying to shoot, and kills are an amazing gratification in multiplayer. Everything is smooth and works well, with nothing seeming out of balance if you know which situation to use it in. The massive maps and inclusion of vehicles pretty much necessitates that every match of conquest or mcom needs to be a team effort, and makes this easy with the squad system. The endless unlocks and medals in the multiplayer ensure you always have a goal to work for, and make sure you never stick with one playstyle long enough to get bored with it.The multiplayer was the most fun I think I've ever had with an fps. The maps are always just the right size to ensure that you can't miss out on the action if there's a full lineup on the server, and with all the variables on each map there's never a dull moment, and every match is a different experience.Moving away from multiplayer, the singleplayer campaign was surprisingly enjoyable as well. The typical 'russians invading the world' plot bores me to death, but with the likeable characters at the forefront, and throwing out the traditional sense of taking everything way too seriously, this campaign was much more enjoyable than others of the same type. Most COD or even later battlefield games just take themselves too seriously, and the constant quips from the characters and such make it so that's never a problem.What it does wrong: EA has never been very good at dealing with customers, and the punkbuster service is no exception. Not only is it an extra account that has to be logged into every time you want to play multiplayer, but sometimes it doesn't even work for multiple attemtps. It can get really frustrating when I just want to play the game. I've heard it was to curb piracy and hacking in the game, but all it really does is inconvenience the actual paying customers. It wasn't a good design choice, especially if EA stops checking up on the servers entirely. I would hate to see an entire game broken because of the lack of consideration by the publisher, but with who we're talking about, it wouldn't be surprising.Another complaint might be the campaign. I know I said it was good, but especially on later playthroughs it can get really repetitive at times. The varied locations are nice, but there's really no reason to play through the campaign to find intel or something once you've beaten it once. This game really shines in the multiplayer, but that doesn't mean some features couldn't have been added to the offline side to make it more enjoyable. Like, you know, a skirmish mode to play against bots. That would've been nice. I don't get how earlier games had this, but DICE just decided to stop doing it all of the sudden. It would've been a godsend when the sign in service was acting up. The campaign could've done with some weapon customization or unlocks or something to make it worth playing more than once anyway.So overall, it's a really great game in the multiplayer side of things, and even still enjoyable in singleplayer. I would definitely recommend that everyone give it a try. It has definitely been one of the best experiences I've had in the gaming world.			"

												Had a lot of fun with this a few years ago, before EA really started making changes into the steaming pile of garbage that they've become.  There is a known issue with this game: EA, upon converting this game to Origin, reused CD keys that paying customers had already been assigned on Steam.  I was effected by this, as were many others (just go through the negative reviews).  I contacted EA four separate times about this issue, and was told that there was nothing they could do.  Mind you, I also have an Origin account on which I have two EA games.  Doesn't matter to them.  This company is absolutely abysmal and I will not be spending money on any game that they have had their hands on or in.  I hope more people take this sort of stance, considering the terrible way they treat their paying customers, as well as handle their products (see BF4 at launch).			"

												This game is hours of fun if you have friends to play it with or just on your own. It did especially after the first Bad Company. Lot of the servers have been shut down, though there are still plenty around with a lot of interesting plugins or just straight vanilla if you look well enough, make sure to use the server browser function!

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.The ying-yang symbol embodies the idea of balance and ideal tranquility. Furthermore, what makes a game worthwhile is that the same conditions are met in several parts of Battlefield: Bad Company 2, from the campaign to the ever immersive multiplayerOverallIn conclusion, this is one of the most intuitive and thought out titles played from the campaign to the multiplayer. If you're a newcomer to the series, the class system may take some getting used to, but if you've played the series before it's all you've ever wanted, vehicles, weapons, gadgets and all This is the best Battlefield game so far, and one of the best FPS games out there. It would be a real shame to miss it.			"

												how to win at the conquest gamemode: have all the reconsOne of my favorite games of all time thats still alive today! Try playing any of the classes, they're all extremely fun. While it is a military shooter, it has a great general atmosphere and personality. If you played this after playing lets say, Battlefield 4, there would be a huge difference in how the characters communicate. All the weapons are equally deadly and have their own niche. Vehicles are fun to drive, but if you don't have an engineer to combat them, the game becomes tank and helicopter simulator. Overall, its extremely fun, and still alive. I highly recommend getting this game. just don't be that extra bushwookie on a team with 3 or more of them.			"

												One of the only modern Battlefield games that I have enjoyed.  A lot of thought and time went into this game; not only in the single player, but also into the multiplayer.  It truly felt like a new game, instead of the regular Battlefield rereleases.  Certainly a great game at its price!  Personally, I'd love to see a new Bad Company Vietnam game!   "

												Hi everyone! - Scroll down for TL;DRI'm here to say that this is the last good battlefield. There is lack of customization weapons wise but the gameplay itself very well makes up for it. The multiplayer is so different from Battlefield 3 & 4. This of course very good. If you will be making this purchase I also highly recommend the ''Vietnam'' DLC.This game is still highly active with many people still playing it. There is about 50 Levels to achieve on the multiplayer. The unlocks last til Level 19 and after that it is pretty much even ground. The levels themselves take some time to get to so the game is a time sink and very worth the every dollar/euro/Your local currency. Now let's get to the game itself.Graphics are pretty good in my opinion. Do mind the game came out 5 years ago *From time of writing the review* and if you're playing games for graphics it's very much like watching Porn for the story.Gameplay wise the soldier has some weight when he's running so it doesn't feel like you glide like in Battlefield 3 & 4. There is no health level indicator which is nice for the people that like it.Campaign is here too. Pretty good one at that. And then there is Vietnam DLC for the history nut.TL;DRBuy this game it has decent graphics.Feels better than the newer counter partsYou will most likely spend loads of time on itNot dissapointed at allThank you very much from me. I hope you will be satisfied with your purchase.			"

												Pros:-Memorable characters in the campaign-Best multiplayer in the whole BF series-DLC isn't DLC; it's basically a whole new game-Balanced; people actually use the other weapons in the game and no kit was overpowered or underpowered-Graphics still look great-Destruction; you could tear up any building-Maps; they actually fit the game mode. For example, they didn't put Valparasio in Conquest, it just wouldn't fit. Cons:-Short campaign (not really reccomended)-No BFBC3-No prone-Not much customization (it was simple though)-Clunky movement; it feels like you are carrying a bag of bricks lolTips:There ARE players, and in fact a lot. Some people are just to dumb to look for a few buttons. In order to get servers, you press the server browser button and then search. omgggggg so hard

A Screenshot of Battlefield: Bad Company 2

Bad Company 2 is a first person shooter game created by DICE and published by EA in 2010. The game features both a team-based multiplayer mode and a singleplayer campaign. The singleplayer campaign has you playing as Marlowe, a member of an elite American special ops team. You start the game,however playing as Thomas Wyatt, coincidentally also a member of a U.S special ops team,though this time you play back in the WWII era instead of in the future. You start out going on a secret mission to meet up with a Japanese Scientist who wants to defect and claims to have valuable information on a new super weapon. Things quickly go to hell and your entire team is wiped out after the Japanese discover you and proceed to make you bear witness to the test firing of the weapon,killing you and your team.


Home sweet home.

You begin the real campaign after that and you start playing as Marlowe,though the campaign is in a futuristic setting now instead of the bleak hell of WWII. The campaign features 13 full levels with each one ranging from 10-20ish minutes to complete,with some more long or difficult missions being around 30-40 minutes at most. For the most part the missions are all quite linear,although they give you open fighting grounds to fill with corpses as you make your way to the objectives.If you came to Bad Co. 2 for a story that would blow your socks off you will be suprisingly (or maybe not suprisingly,depending on how you feel about Battlefield) dissappointed. The story isn't poorly made nor is it poorly done at all really. Problems arise when you have a story that is incredibly average and is only being held up by the unparalleled gunplay. When you get into the thick of fighting it's easy to get lost in the heavy smoke of the fresh gunpowder and the whump of your rifle as you mow down entire squads in your quest to save America from Soviet invasion.

Into the Fire . . . With Some Help The campaign may not be anything special but i'll be damned if this isn't one of the most fun MP modes I have played in quite a while. The destructibility is astoundingly fun to play with and actually has some serious strategic value. Enemy sniper hiding behind a window? 40MM Grenade launcher solves that real quick. Enemy soldiers crossing a bridge into your base? Blow that bridge to hell and back! Being able to just destroy pretty much anything at anytime you want is an incredible idea in both the campaign and the multiplayer. The multiplayer itself consists of 5 different game modes each with varying degrees of difficulty. The first one is Conquest,a mode where each team has a set amount of tickets,dying will of course drop this ticket total by 1 per death,and the goal is to drain the other teams tickets before they drain yours. There are also multiple flags you can hold that will give you a constant ticket drain if you hold the majority. Other than that you just need to kill them faster than they can kill you.The next mode is Rush,a gamemode where you have two teams,attackers and defenders each trying to attack or defend multiple M-COM stations respectively. Attackers are tasked with setting C4 charges on the stations then defending them until they explode. Defenders,of course are charged with defending the stations until they finally bring the attackers' ticket count to zero.After that you have Team Deathmatch which,if you have ever played a multiplayer FPS before, just consists two teams each trying to end the game with the most kills. Next you have squad rush which is just normal rush but with no vehicles,smaller maps,and a max of eight players.Finally there's onslaught,a co-op DLC mode where you try to play against AI and capture flags. Vehicles spawn at certain points and there are multiple levels of difficulty to fight against. Generally all the MP modes seem fairly balanced and there were no glaring problems with the mode that I noticed during regular play. The matchmaking system is completely broken and will either not find you a match,even though plenty are available,or it will put you in a match with just yourself; so make sure you just use server browser.The Multiplayer is what you really would be buying this game for as the campaign was pretty much overlooked due to more people wanting MP than SP.TL;DRAn excellent game for the price. Astoundingly well done MP component with an overwhelmingly average SP campaign. Solid gunplay and unparalled destructability make this a game you wont want to miss.If you enjoyed this writing and want to read more of such reviews,check out my steam curator page at Mudkips Gaming "

												This is the well-known BBF sequel which made many players reconsider what game to buy, all thank to Dice. I bought this game for almost 5 euros, when Summer Sale 2013 was going on.This game totally gave me another view upon FPS games, concerning graphics, physics, environment and so on. What is unique about this game is what DICE has been developing for good years>FROSTBITE. A cool thing that makes a good interrelation between Cause and Effect(s). Look for some gameplays/playthrough on YouTube, you will get it easy.

			Hey guys. Today we're going to take a look at Bad Company 2 after a year of playing BF3 and see what's changed. LevelCap's Computer Hardware: http://astore.amazon.com/leve0f-20 Streaming:...		

Pro:- great environment feeling;- teamplay;- variety of weapons which you can customize afterwards;- variety of vehicles, choppers, tanks- not talking about their particular model of vehicle, but their usage;- large maps(it's not a 'cozy's camper paradise'- it just fits to all 4 classes available in the game);- again great teamplay courtesy of each classe's duty;- great graphics;- astonoshing real sound.Cons:- can't find any at the moment;- just to fill this space, the price should be lowered.All in all, I would recommend it to my friends, fact that I already did it. It still diserves attention even if its successors have domninated the FPS games market. I would have played more but, I don't have that much time left for videogames because of school.It's a must-have game! COME ON AND GET IT! "

												Where Battlefield 2 was about that slower paced Squad based Teamwork, Battlefield: Bad Company 2 went in the complete opposite direction. Sure if you work as a team you'll overcome and win as you'd expect, but the pace is ramped up and the craziness is all the way up to 11!The singleplayer campaign has it's moments, but as with any Battlefield game that has a singleplayer campaign it's not what you'll ultimately be buying the game for. It's the multiplayer - as it should be and as it always should be. Whereas the original Bad Company was tongue-in-cheek and entirely selfaware of how over the top the franchise was at times (as well as the FPS genre in a post-Modern Warfare world), Bad Company 2 tones it down slightly (much to my own personal disappointment). I personally didn't mind the Bad Company spinoff from the Battlefield series, it was it's own thing and that was entirely fine with me. However, it appears as if Bad Company 2 is almost ashamed of it's original brother and returns to a more 'grounded' root, and almost tries to ape Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's fast paced Michael Bay OTT action... while keeping a straight face.Which is a shame.However... that's not what you're interested in in this game... to the multiplayer!The multiplayer aspect offers you almost everything you'd ask for in a Battlefield game - big maps, crazy weapons, tons of Armor and memorible moments of madness. This was one of the first Battlefield games to really try and push the envelope visually as they ramped up the Frostbite Engine to a whole new level of insanity. I remember feeling 'My PC can actually play this?!' to great surprise and glee too.So don't undersell your PC if you're unsure on the specs. The minimum specs will still give you a good visual experience.As for the gameplay, I think this was my favourite. I can't really put my finger on what it was exactly, but everything just seemed to work well together. Teamwork, classes, weapons - land mines. Land Mines. C4. Land mines. Airstrike. Land minds. C4...OK, so it's the explosions. Planting landmines, hiding around the corner and giggling like a Japanese schoolgirl as that big burley tank came lumbering around the corner to go down the narrow street time and time again. Yup, it's the land mines. Buy this game.Plant land mines.Laugh like Japanese Schoolgirl.			"

Unlike other FPS games from the same franchise like Battlefield 3 and Hardline which are slowly dying, BC2 still has an active community, affordable price and a stable number of servers which are full 24/7 despite the fact that the game is almost 6 years old.Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Vietnam adds an extreamly fun new maps and weapons which are restricted only to owners of the DLC.

The Bad Company series are the only Battlefield games to contain a high quality story with truly memorable characters. The multiplayer is the best in its class, with FULL terrain and building destruction across huge maps. Battlefield 3, 4 and even Battlefield 1 don't even come close to the legacy this game has.A game with a truly legendary status in First Person Shooter history.			"

After three years of not playing, was thrilled to discover that not only is this game around on steam, but it still has an active community of around a thousand players as of the time of this review. With a wide selection of guns and maps, and access to modded servers dedicated to the Vietnam expansion, i'd heavily recommend this game to any fan of it from the consoles along with new players. For a 6 year old game, it's aged very well! 9/10			"

												With the new Origin conversion and adding it too steam. EA totally ♥♥♥♥ed players who had previously played before EA screwed themselves over. So if you feel like playing this game just for some nostalgia...good luck. It will say your product is already registered and thats pretty much the only the only thing EA will say to you. They wont help you get your game back. The game is great...EA is just a bunch of theives.			"

												Loved this game on PS3 but no one plays it on console anymore. It was the first console game I bought and the only one I played for 6 months. Just loved it. Missed it so much I had to buy it on steam. Yes, it still is the best FPS. Perhaps the graphics aren't top notch compared to latest FPS games but the feeling and maps are wonderful. Still a living community and finding servers is not hard at all (2015-01-25).5+ game.			"

												Better than Battlefield 4, and the closest thing you can get to Battlefield 2.Get this game. It's Battlefield 2 without the dings and whistles of commanders, planes, and aircraft carriers.The story is awesome and hilarious, and the mulitplayer is casual to hardcore (depending on the server) with a good learning curve. It gives really good XP rewards for doing simple teamplay steps like healing people and fixing things, and it is possible to end the game at the top of the leader board with 3 kills and 12 deaths because you were healing, fixing, and giving people ammo.

												A game from way back before DICE got greedy. You pay once and never need to pay for anything again; all of the DLC packs were released for free for PC gamers, as well as regular updates and minor content patches.And they've been asking what people liked about Bad Company 2 so much? I wonder...Very worth it, doesn't use the crappy 'battlefield facebook' system either, uses the classic menu system. It is, by far, the best of the new Battlefield games. Quite different than say the original battlefield games, but in a good way, whilst doing what the newer games are trying to do, but better.And less network lag, so rounds will register more often. Game does still have the issue though, but not anywhere near as bad as BF3/4 have it.			"

												I've at least dabbled in all the Battlefield games from Battlefield 2 upwards, but I have to say that this is the best one for a fair number of reasons. To find out why follow me... I'll be reporting from inside the fight! (Races off towards distant towering explosions erupting over the war-shattered horizon, stubs toe, cries.)If you're after single player Bad Company 2 brings some fairly smart level design with a sharp, fairly witty script that approaches like a Shane Black movie. It's not screen-writing brilliance or anything, but it has a far greater sense of fun and playfulness than its increasingly tedious sequels and the latter Call of Duty games. No dark and gritty moping about here, purporting to show the 'horrors' of war whilst quivering with lust over the latest sniper scope attachment, nope. Just four Bro-Force men (or rather three and a mandatory smart-aleck quipping Shane Black staple) taking down the bad guys like out of some Kelly's Heroes meets Commando movie. So yeah, not genius, but fun. Battlefield 3's snooze-inducing 'arty' debriefing scenes framework nearly made me break my nose on the computer desk, so lethargic they made me. I cannot really recall Battlefield 4's at all. Plus the game is a lot less linear than subsequent outings, where you get to use the completely destructible scenery to its fullest advantage to forge new paths in completing a level.(""The stretched twig of peace is at melting point..."") Graphics! Well, they're very nice. Sure, Battlefield 3 & 4 have slightly shinier, more detailed graphics with slightly more convincing character animations and lens flare coo-worthy prettiness. But really, these graphics more than do the job. Dust clouds from descending helicopters, litter blowing in the streets, shockwaves rippling, shrapnel flying through the air... it's all here. And it won't tax your modern day computer too much neither. And there isn't too much going on to distract from the gunplay and everything runs smooth, so you won't be visually overwhelmed whilst trying to pick off the bad guys so much.And this game has the joint best audio of any game ever. The co-achiever of this award goes to The Long Dark, and its tremendously atmospheric sparse soundtrack and wonderful environmental sound. But Bad Company 2 has something magical called 'The War Tapes', activate it and feel like 1990's CNN war correspondent Peter Arnett fired by the NEWS CANNON of an Abraham Tank into the SOUNDS OF A WAR MIXED BY THE DERANGED PHIL SPECTOR HIMSELF. Ahem. Basically it's just a rather fantastic mix of panicky crackling intercom messages, wonderful bass-rumbling cannon fire and the sound of bullets zipping past your ears. You need headphones to really do it justice. (""...people here are very much bursting with war..."")So, you all know the basics of how it plays, no doubt. But how's the multiplayer? Well, it's the best in the series. This is beautifully balanced shooter created before kill-streak bonuses and landfill-stuffing +0.2% shotgun-accuracy unlocks smothered fun like a big statty-based tidal wave of squinty misery. There's four classes performing the roles of assault, medic, anti-tank and recon sniper. The recon sniper is the smartest tweak of the set, as the game encourages snipers to move closer to the action with such toys as C4 and movement sensors. The game gives them fun close quarter pistols and ways to support the team from the front lines. You can also snipe too, and have fun doing it, but you can no longer prone. This encourages movement, and forces snipers to quit camping and instead rove the buildings of a battlefield, picking off hapless players and then fleeing the area as enraged victims bring the upper floors crashing down upon their noggin. Yes, crashing floors. Practically all the buildings in Bad Company 2 can be blown apart piece by piece until the entire edifice comes a-tumbling down in a avalance of masonry-mayhem. It makes for great tactical play too. Using a grenade launcher to create a new entrance point never gets old, especially if Johnny-Foe is caught on the other side of the impromptu door opening. Yup, by the end of the battle few structures remain unscathed. (""...this very much is a country about to blow up in it's own face."" The maps are very good, with shout-outs going to Panama Canal, Arica Harbour and Oasis as to my mind the best three. I also have a fondness for the atmospheric snowy levels. The only maps I don't like are Harvest Day and Heavy Metal, which are vehicle dominated. I find it very hard to get a good footing on either of them, and the lack of cover makes trying to get around an abject misery. Not much room for tactical play either. Predictably, they seem to be the most popular on the servers. Gngh and argh.What else? Well, it all seems a bit more fluid and smoother than the latter Battlefields. Wiser and more knowledgable heads might nod knowingly and mutter the words, 'netcode', or something, but I've got no real idea why. All I know is it feels more fun to me. And I guess that's the important thing. SO. If you're itching to buy a military-themed multiplayer shooter with lots of vehicles and explosions and scenes unfolding like the best bits of Apocalypse Now, then get this one. It's pretty much the only one you'll need and is far less depressing than the 'mature' ponderous tosh forced on us nowadays. In Summary: COMPLETELY BANG! BAD COMPANY 2 IS SO ENTHUSIASTICALLY WAR IT'S BRINGING YOU ANOTHER TEAR ON THE FACE OF THE WORLD'S MOTHER. 9 / 10P.S: Apologies for the excess of The Day Today references.			"

												Here's what I remember about the campaign: I couldn't beat it. It was really, really hard. The AI seemed too smart, too capable, too deadly. And then, because Windows 7 64-bit was giving me trouble at the time, I downgraded, switched back to good old Vista, and lo and behold, suddenly, I beat the campaign with no issues. Since then, I have played on Windows 7, which has none of the teething problems it used to, and not experienced this problem.Weird, right?I have no explanation for this. None whatsoever.The campaign is short--you know how people always accuse multiplayer campaigns of being like four hours long? Well, me, I generally play them in two to three times that much. Only a small handful of games have ever proven to me to be super short, and Bad Company 2 is one of them. It's not a particularly well-designed campaign, either. Fun, I guess, but limited. The multiplayer was where I spent all my time. Never before or since has a game gripped me as much. I'd be willing to argue it's the best multiplayer in the Battlefield series--it doesn't use that stupid web-based Battlelog like BF3 and BF4 do, after all.Other than a lack of maps--that were eventually added in, a lack of multiplayer modes (people only ever seem to play Rush or Conquest, a far cry from the dozens of multiplayer modes that ship with other games, like Unreal Tournament or Call of Duty), and a frequent re-use of map assets (which were first seen in BFBC1 and reused in BF3), it's just... the best. It's tweaked right, the classes feel balanced, and the maps themselves are my favorites. I wouldn't say everyone should play this game, but I will say that if you like team-based multiplayer shooters, Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is something you'll enjoy.The Vietnam expansion was pretty cool, by the way.

Decent multipleeer, as befits the Battlefield series.I'm surprised, but in BC 2 More live online. 3.Frostbite. To this day, it is striking in its destructible. 4.To memorize the company.The colorful characters and wonderful Cat scene did their job. 5.Huge and a variety of maps.Thanks to them, you do not get tired so fast game.Disadvantages: 1.Cheaters.

Do you like fixing♥♥♥♥♥♥ Engineer. Are you the team's white mage? Medic. Are you that guy who always brings stuff to parties? Assault. Are you a loner? Recon. Insane amounts of vehicles to choose from. Drive a tank and bring pressure to an objective, drive a helicopter and feel you're on top of the world, or drive a quad bike for 8 seconds just to be blown up by an enemy tank. There's no better feeling than playing this game with a full squad of your friends and ending off the game just to see that you got the Best Squad Pin every single time. Bad Company 3 when?			"

												Bad Company 2 is my favorite Battlefield title.The single player mission is intriguing and well-made.I especially love the thought put into the sound effects.These days, shooters are all about flashy items and gun skins. Bad Company 2 doesn't do that.Good multiplayer experience and still many people play it.Hackers are also not that much of a problem in this game, I haven't seen any so far.Very nice game;- nice graphics- great sounds- great lighting effects, but not too flashy- building destruction, but not over the top- vehicles that can be repaired, including helicopters: these might require some practice before use..- many guns to choose from- rank system that reaches 50, but you only really need to get to 20-30, everything is unlocked then- fireteams that allow allot more tactical play (I suggest playing Conquest/Rush) "

												Singleplayer* Story is quite generic, but characters make up for it. * Not too long, showcases every mechanic except helicopter piloting.* On normal it has some difficulty spikes (2 helicopters fort depended on luck a bit), but in general immortal teammates and explosives spam make it quite easy most of the time.* Several scenes make you RATATATATA, and that's the best part about the game.* Destructibilty changes rules of getting in coverMultiplayerI'm late to start playing it, but it is still alive. Vietnam on the other hand had only couple active servers.			"

												This game is amazing: fast-paced, highly destructable, team-orientated, and just a load of fun! This game is highly recommended if you have friends to play online with, each playing their own class on the squad to have a fully rounded team. Yet, if you are looking forward to playing this by yourself, have no fear! This is one of the only FPS games out there that is actually fun to play online (or singleplayer) by yourself. It runs on basically any computer, and is one of the best Battlefield games on the market. Be aware though! If you are new to FPS's, this game can be extremely hard in the beginning online. There are a lot of experienced players whom have been playing this game since release, and have mastered it entirely. But do not be afraid, learn the maps, guns, and loadouts, and you will still have a blast playing! Highly recommended.			"

												If you don't mind wading into a small, hardened community of veterans, BC2 is still an excellent (I would say the best) entry in the Battlefield series. The gameplay is tight, the maps are interesting and the shooting just feels right. Since you will be dying a *lot* when you do find a server to settle down on, I wouldn't advise buying in unless you can pick it up on sale - this should give the added bonus of a spike of community interest as well, making it a bit easier to blend in to the chicken shoot  while the players who've been at it since 2011 have their way with the fresh meat ;)			"

												A classic and probably the best FPS game to date.  Title Battlefield: Bad Company 2   Developer EA DICE (Digital Illusions CE)   Publisher Electronic Arts  Release 2 March 2010  Graphics 3D   Genre FPS  Price €9,99  Rating  9/10 The game.Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is as complete a package as you could ever ask for. I've always been more of a COD fan instead of Battlefield. However, of course Battlefield is also a great game and, for me, this one, the BF:BC2 is the last truly great Battlefield.Gameplay.BF:BC2 offers to you the choose to fight for one of three military superpowers: the United States, the Chinese, or the newly formed Middle East Coalition. Armed with the latest modern weaponry, players can take control of any of the game’s +30 vehicles to engage in major conflicts with over 64 players in some of the largest online battlese.The sound design and graphics are really good, the destruction is great too. The whole multiplayer is by far the most exciting and entertaining part of the game, even though the campaign was lacking, it is fast-paced, brutal, and spectacularly fun.Pros. (+)Multiplayer is awesome.Sound design is very realistic.Great graphics.Squad style play and spawning mix very nicely together.A lot of destruction.Cons. (-)None.All in all, an absolute must have for any Battlefield fan.Probably, one of the best FPS's games until today.			"

Heres what makes it great -- Great hit detection, You dont die behind walls & feel cheated.- Better thought out level design.- More destructability than BF4.- Stil modern looking graphics.- Easy to find online games on any gamemode.If you have never played BC2 before your missing out, In my oppinion its as good as BF3 & better than BF4.

												Great gameplay!  Even today and its Decemeber 2014.  It has fully destructible environments and balances enough between fast paced action and using tactics/strategy to accomplish your mission.  Also provides enough option to be a lone wolf or function as part of a squad/team.   Graphics are still really good.  I am able to crank everything up and it doesn't look as shiney as some of the new games with ooooooo' wow factors but still does a great job of creating the environment to play in.   The weapons, vehicles, and soldier classes all offer fun and varieted styles of gameplay, all while being still balanced enough that there isn't any given setup thats OP.If you enjoy fast action with some strategy and tactcis, I would 100% recommend this game.     I would pay full price if this exact game was re-released with just a graphics engine update to current standards.   ITS THAT GOOD!			"

												The best Battlefield. The map design is excellent; it prioritizes fun engagements above all else. Maps are largely built around prefab, destructible, 2-3 floor buildings, which buffer the flow of combat and compartmentalize individual encounters. This means that you can actually breathe and make meaningful decisions in between all of the twitch-based watch-every-corner assaults. You know that segment in every battlefield scene where two soldiers duck behind cover and banter, using the moment of calm to rest and survey their surroundings before leaping back out guns blazing? This game is all about that moment. Front lines move back and forth in a perceivable way, you can get caught in epic holdouts with your squad, and buildings take a LOT of damage before they collapse, with each blown-out wall potentially changing your tactics. And despite how dynamic things get, you never burn out. Because you can breathe.Oh, and there are NO JETS, which means that A) Infantry can meaningfully engage every vehicle, B) no player has to  dedicate themself exclusively to countering air units, C) air units are easy to keep track of, and D) air combat remains cover-based and low-flying. The whole ""battlefield"" experience is much more tightly woven together as a result.			"

												What can I say? This game is legend and considered one of the best of it's franchise just as Call of duty 4 is considered best of its franchise. It's a learning curve that is for sure. Getting used to picking out players from the debris and aiming accurately with the sniper rifle will probably do your head in greatly as it did with me. (see my video's)Some of my thoughts of the game:Tank machine guns can snipe you accross the map.Snipers on hills can be seen very easily.You can be flanked and killed very easily.Tanks have little to no health and die very easily by rockets.Tank shells are VERY easily avoidable. A tank without a machine gunner is effectively useless.Snipers have to be extremely accurate anything other than headshot is a hitmarker.Flying a helicopter is like trying to fly a private jet upsidedown in GTA V It's hard as hell.Helicopters are like tanks and die REALLY easily.Jet's don't appear to be present which is sad as they were their in BF:Vietnam and BF:1943A bug with the connection with EA will require customized launch options in order to remain connected. EA must fix.The game needs more individual graphic settings apart from ""High,Medium,Low""and one final thing.It needs more new players to allow more balanced gameplay as many of the players present are at level cap and have all the best weapons unlocked.the community is alive it only needs a new influx of new players to balance the gameplay.

												Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is as complete a package as you could ever ask for.Both singleplayer and multiplayer experiences excel in Bad Company 2, and the sequel is a great step up from its first iteration. This is one of the best and most addictive on-line experiences in a shooter in years.Bad Company 2 is an excellent game and the best modern warfare shooter to date. Despite the cookie-cutter campaign, it beats Modern Warfare 2 in both single-player and multiplayer.The game is really amazing, the destruction adds a great level of immersion and gameplay, everything feels polished, and the attention and respect the PC version has gotten has been a hit for Dice as they reported that the PC version of the game is the highest seller.Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is one of the best shooters of this generation. The game has steel-solid mechanics, top gen graphics and an incredible multiplayer.			"

												Amazing game that has fantastic graphics even for today. The campaign is awesome with memorable chracters and twists, the multiplayer has classic maps and gamemodes, and the sound design is amazing (set audio settings to wartapes it is insane). A problem you will probably encounter is if you put in the cd key for the game on another computer it will say it is already in use. Contact EA and hope for the best and make sure you still have the receipt. If you do not want to go through that just buy it on Origin.			"

												The best Battlefield ever made ( I played all up  to and including 3) - and still has it's online crowd (sadly,much less on the Vietnam maps).Single player campaign is fun while it lasts, but even on casual games I still enjoy MP maps, since there are no spawn kills and other pleasure deterrents from game abusers.I made myself stop playing it since I have so many other games to play before I die...Great soundtrack for the Vietnam maps.10/10			"

												BFBC2 can be considered as a 'scaled-down' BF game. It is simpler: maximum only 32 players per server , less weapons and attachments, less options.At the same time, some people do dislike having too many players on a server, prefer actually playing rather than spending time choosing and matching from too many weapons/attachment options and having too many complexities - in other words, wanting to play a 'simpler' BF, but still wanting a 'BF-ish' game and not COD or others.If you want to play a game and have fun, personally, I have a lot of fun with this game (I have and also play another seven BF games).At the time of writing, number of players online range from a few hundred to over a thousand. To check current numbers:http://steamcharts.com/app/24960To check where the servers are located:https://www.gametracker.com/search/bc2/US/?sort=3&order=DESCDo check at different times of the day as the population in servers drastically change (obviously), and just one 'snapshot view' won't tell you much about the online numbers and locations of where the players are.Depending on the location, some people may only have more distant servers to play on with higher pings - different people feel differently about higher pings. For me: I get to play BF4 on a high tick 60 or 120Hz server with 30 ping all the time, but at the same time I also really enjoy playing BFBC2 with a ping of 150.The above is a just a very brief summary of what the game is about - depending on what you are looking for and what you like, the choice is yours.(I'm not commenting on the campaign because I don't play campaigns)			"

												The only game that can compete with TF2 for me (in terms of teamplay). If you can't work together with your squad and same is happening to other squads - you will lose for sure. I don't really think that it needs detailed review - Battlefield is a legend, and Bad Company spin-off is a gem. The playerbase is pretty solid and online is pretty stable, so don't worry about that and get it.And don't use shotguns. Just don't. Please. Really. Don't use 'em...			"

Don't mind my few hours on Steam with this game, as I played another 15 hours on the version I have registered on Origin.Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is a 2010 first-person shooter video game developed by EA DICE. Released in 2010, this game still outdoes nearly every single other game out of the Battlefield-series, and nearly no-one knows why.The singleplayer is one to be played (though it is a little weird... played it 4 or more times and didn't really understood of what was going on), and the multiplayer has become more than friendly to new players, as there are multiple High-XP-servers on which you can unlock all the weapons within about 2 hours, depending on how you play. You do not need to have Origin started in order to play this game, which is another laaaaarge plus-point.Using Frostbite 1.5, the game looks decent as has good physics concerning the recoil of weapons and the handling of vehicles that are usable ingame.With the Vietnam DLC, it brings a more historical touch to the game, sadly without a singleplayer campaign, which I imagine would have been the cherry on top of the cake.Being both brutal and atmospheric at once, this game is a must-have for every Battlefield-fan out there, and a game to be played for every non-Battlefield-fan. ;)Did I already mention that Battlefield: Bad Company 2 does not require Origin? Because it doesn't  which is pretty cool if you ask me. "

												Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is a competitive multiplayer FPS with very simple enjoyable gameplay.It also might be the only current-gen/next-gen Battlefield game to not be stained by Electronic Art's greediness. Just wait before the franchise turns into a free-to-play game with micro-transactions and before it invades the Android platform.The community is still active even nowadays. And yet the game is still the most overlooked Battlefield of the franchise. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed BF3 and BF4, but this game is a classic. Boasts more players than Hardline, doesn't require Origin, no Battlelog, no suppression, no premium.PROS :+ Very arcadiesh gameplay that features lots of destroyable buildings and such+ Love that it has a bullet drop mechanic so that snipers can't shoot from 8,000 miles away and not have to adjust+ Doesn't require Origin to play+ In-game servers browser and matchmaking system (no web browsing like BF3 BF4)+ No premium account, season pass or whatever you call it+ Doesn't have multiplayer map packs Call of Duty, feels like a complete game by itself+ No unlock purchase+ Melee killing people gives your their dogtag (ID) which permanently stays in your profile as a momento of lists of people you've disgraced, feels almost like an achievement that doesn't stop growing+ One amazing DLC that feels like a Total Conversion or a reskin of Battlefield in the Vietnam War era+ Winning objectives opens up further parts of the mapCONS :- No 64 players maps- No option to change the narrow field of view (default 65) except in the .ini document- Unlike Battlefield 2, Bad Company 2 features no mod- Bad Company 2 Vietnam servers are almost empty (if you're lucky you may find two active servers)Old doesn't mean obsolete!Forget about Battlefield 3 and 4 and be part of the Bad Company!TL;DR:9.0Great classic FPS that isn't corrupted by micro-transactions			"

 Battlefield: Bad Company 2  This is definitely a very good production. The game offers a very nice campaign for single player and multiplayer mode. The story takes us once again to play as member of bad company, Preston Marlowe and our goal is to find the secret weapon before Russians. The game's story is short but really nice. Multiplayer is very nice, dynamic gameplay and unlocking the following weapons can make you play for hours. Moving around in different vehicles and a large area of movement is amazing and thanks to the Frostbite engine there is a amazing damage model of world. Very nice graphics, good sound effects, a cool storyline, and addictive multiplayer. There is a certainly adequate benefits to purchase the game for a few euros on the sale. In the game, I lost a dozen hours and I had a lot of fun while playing this game. As for me, the game is worth a play. "

												I've owned this game on PS3 and 360. I'm new to the PC and it doesn't look like I'm going to turn back! I don't understand why a game like this isn't CRAWLING with gamers! There is a certain ""FEEL"" to this game that I haven't experienced with any other. Every time I get a kill its just as exciting as the first. I like the destruction and even the way you blend in with the environment. You can actually HIDE in a bush and be overlooked. Also, if you run your squad tight and well rounded you can be very effective online. A good squad is very important. I don't like how COD or even some of the other BF games are just ""run and gun"". No cares given kind of play style. This CAN sometimes happen with this game but seems to be with TDM mainly. Most of the time with this game you need to give your movments a little more thought. You might be staring down the barrel of a T-90 if you just come blazing around a corner. BLAH BLAH BLAH the game is AWESOME and my personal favorite FPS and one of my favorite games ever. EASILY WORTH EVERY PENNY!			"

												Those looking at Bad Company 2 as only a single-player game might come away disappointed. It's an action packed, gorgeous, and explosive game but it doesn't quite come together into a campaign for the ages. It more feels like an added bonus to the multiplayer game and for those in search of that, this is a great choice. Bad Company 2 as an online shooter is flexible and engaging, offering several features that the competition can only dream of. If you're looking for a more strategic and team-based change of pace, look no further because this is the game for you. BUT! Sadly the multiplayer is very, very hard if you want to just tricksh*t and stuff like that, most of the players that play as you read this are high level people that have a lot of experience with this game, but well, suck it up and kick some!

 Battlefield: Bad Company 2 / Vietnam DLC Graphically this game is beautiful and ONE OF THE ONLY GAMES TO NAIL REALISTIC GUNPLAY. Weapons echo with passion and feel meaty. Map design is mapped wonderfully and every location is a work of art. Although this game is starting to rack up on years it still has a wonderful thriving community that averages about 3,000 players per day. New players hopping on nearly everyday. Also IT'S FUN AS HELL.With BBC2 you also get it's Vietnam DLC for free. Another perfect addition to this masterpeice. Newer Battlefield games got NOTHING on bad company 2. Honestly BBC2 is one of THE BEST military fps games EVER developed and has my eternal bias. GET THIS GAME.			"

It's nice to be able to blow up and shoot people etc, but I don't think it's worth full price.

												This game was released 2010. That is 6 years ago and we know what EA and Dice has given us after that. A lot of improvements, graphicly, Frostbite engine, Higher tick rate servers etc. + Graphic: The graphic is really nice and the gameplay feel very smooth. + Storyline: I wish I could have played Bad Company 1 as well because I do believe that it had a better story. However the actors and the comedy make this story to one of a kind. No doubt. + Frostbite engine: On Bad Company 1/2 they let you destroy much more enviorment than BF 3/4. Which is always fun+ Weapons: The weapon FEELS powerful. The sound are really nice. + Soundtrack: I really like how they added music to the game. It adds much more feeling to the game. - Multiplayer unbalanced maps: This problem still remains in Battlefield 3/4 as well. The map are too unbalanced. Which means on some maps, 8/10 times you etheir win hard or lose hard. There is no between. This cannot be blamed on the teams. It is a map issue. - There is hardly any rest time in multiplayer. When you lose a base in rush. It takes you 10 seconds and then the enemy are nearby the next objective. Very intense and I disslike it. Personal opinion- During the story line you run a lot. On Battlefield 3/4 they leave you with much more action, less running. I put it as a negative thing however it is a personal preference. - Story line bugs. There are a lot of them. CPU that won't die. Terrain bugs. etc. It is not something that RUIN the story but everytime it happens. It will remind you that it exist. I won't compare this game to Battlefield 3/4 so I say as a game in general 8/10			"

												I bought this game by accident. When it was on 75% sale, I bought 3 or 4 copies of it to resell later for TF2 keys, and then sell them on the steam market for profit (yea, I know that's lame). But instead of buying all of them as gifts, I accidentally bought one copy for myself. And now, when I finally got a new computer and can play it normally, I can say that I don't regret it at all.I heard a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥about EA and origin, so I didn't expect much from this game, yet it turned out to be really addicting and surprisingly fun.I'm not going to say too much about the campaign because this game is much more multiplayer-oriented. It's pretty good for getting a grasp on how the game mechanics and weapons work, but I didn't like it TOO much. The plot and characters seem ok, but actual combat is a bit frustrating because your squadmates are downright dumb and you'll  have to kill 90% of the bad guys yourself (another reason for that is that they usually wait for YOU to go first and take all the fire while they sit in some cover). Duh, at least they are immortal, because it would be EXTREMELY frustrating if the game would restart when someone from your squad is killed. And finally - the enemies usually outnumber you by 4-5 times, do the US military commanders really expect THAT much from 4 guys? Unlikely.The multiplayer, on the other hand, is really awesome. You'll probably get stomped in the beginning though, because crucial unlocks for your soldier are received after not too much, but noticable playtime - for instance, in the beginning your medic loadout will be MG+pistol, that's all; medkit and defibrillator is easily unlocked later, but still kinda frustrating when your teammates expect you to throw some first aid at them and you, well, CAN'T. That being said, at least most WEAPONS you get at the start are pretty good, most notably sniper rifle and assault rifle.The overall balance is great, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ specializations (not meaning to start a flame war, but CoD's ""martyrdom"" comes to mind), no OP weapons (in my opinion; many people seem to hate carl gustav AT, but I have no problem with that), and each of 4 classes can contribute to the team - medic heals and revives, assault can use smoke grenades to cover his teammates and gives ammo boxes, engie repairs tanks and recon, well, can at least spot and throw motion sensors (btw, the spotting mechanic is really good, allows you to communicate with your team + if you're being shot by a camper, instead of frantically trying to write something in chat, you can simply press ""q"" and your bloodthirsty teammates will kill him).Vehicles are also great, a tank in skilled hands with an engineer repairing it can be devastating, but can be just as  easily destroyed with some teamwork.The community... Let's just say it's ok, like in any typical multiplayer game. Even then, the chat takes up a small area in the corner of the screen, you can very well ignore it (I haven't met any people who use microphones after 55 hrs of total playtime). But generally most people are willing to cooperate (medics revive and heal when you ask for it, assaults drop ammo boxes etc.).Overall, this is a great game with a lot of variety, never gets boring and has surprisingly never made me mad even when I got killed a lot. Worth buying, wait for a sale if you don't want to spend too much money on games.			"

												So... I have written very few reviews on Steam and am not the greatest at them, but here goes.                  Battlefield Bad Company Two: I myself have been playing Battlefield since 1942. I own a copy of every battlefield there is. I own physical copies of Battlefied 1942, Vietnam and Modern WArfare (Not the greatest of the series but the first to hit concoles) I also own a copy of Battlefield 3 on Origin ( 4 was a complete joke due to EA forcing Dice to rush the production in under a year, thus I speak not of it).                  Battlefield Bad Company 2 comes with a high reccomendation from myself as a veteran of the series. Coupled with graphics that have aged extremely well over the past 6 years, solid gameplay and amazing destruction for its time. This game offers an experience no other Battlefield has yet to do. With a sound engine that supports 7.1 Surround, graphics that look and still feel real, and large maps with balanced classes and vehicles. This game is still to date my favourite of the series.                   Now for the sad part... Battlefield Bad Company 2 is slowly dieing out. Servers are become ghost towns as players are drawn to the c**p that EA forces its development teams to pump out. I beg this of thee, please purchase this game, come experience it with me, bring back the life that was one so bright, join us in keeping this game aloft in our quest for giant and beyond fun battles. Show EA that a great game does not come from its amount of DLC. But from the love of a lasting community that is will to pay for a single product, and continue to play it even decades after its release. Help us keep this game going, come join us... The Battlefield awaits you.			"

												One of the best games I've ever playedSingleplayer: the Story was ""okay"" i suppose since it was kind of dull unlike the Call of Duty series which have fairly decent storylines. I think they should put a bit more time into developing the Singleplayer, at least as much time as they have spent on the multiplayer.Multiplayer: It seems to me that the Multiplayer was really worked on in this game because it was more refined and more interesting than the Singleplayer. There is a great variety of weapons and weapon addons in the multiplayer for you to chose from. There are also different classes that focus on your playing style. Suppose you want to kill people with a sniper rifle. You can easily choose the recon class that allows you to have a sniper rifle, a pistol, Mortar strike and a motion censor.You can also add a red dot scope on to your Sniper Rifle for close range combat. Not only that but there are class perks that really brings your playing style out. Suppose you want to do a lot of damage as recon, you can unlock and equip the Magnum Bullets perk to maximize your damage. I would highly recommend buying this game, it will not dissapoint you.

												Shortly; Battlefield Bad Company 2 was over my expectations. Even though my expectations weren't set that high, DICE really delivered yet another solid shooter. It's a great game for anyone who enjoyed the previous Battlefield games. The long version;  In perspective to the Battlefield series;  I know many people complain about this game, and I've even heard DICE themselves say that it wasn't the best they've created. And on the last point, I need to agree, it's not the best game in the Battlefield series, not according to me. I've been along since the beginning (1942) and played all the games released in the series. The most unappealing to me was the 2142, somehow I couldn't accept the futuristic side of a Battlefield game. That said, Battlefield 2 is to me the best game in the series (Yes, even now with 3 and 4 out.), to me, it was a more ground-breaking game than the rest of the series later have been. But, I shouldn't speak to highly of it, a big part of it now is nostalgia I've got to admit.  Singleplayer;  I played BFBC1 through the main story, and though the missions and all maybe weren't the best. I liked it, it was fun, and for BFBC2 I have to say the same. Note though that it was the characters and the story that sold me into it. If you don't appreciate the humoristic side of it, I don't think it's that much to aim for.  Multiplayer;  Here is where it excels (Remember, I only speak for my opinion.);  I didn't get the chance to play that much multiplayer on BFBC1 so I can't compare it much to that. However, teaming up with some of your friends and jump into a squad with them, and play tactical (Okay, we didn't take it that serious, but we still teamworked.) I don't see how you can't like it. It's a great FPS, it's a really great FPS. The majority of the maps feels designed with care. The classes are fairly balanced, even though you'll be swearing alot about snipers taking you down a little bit too often. (This of course varied from patch to patch.). And the vehicle play was a treat. With the Frostbite engine, everything looks great.  The level and weapons system is neatly created, even though it took almost to fast to unlock all the weapons considering how many levels there were left after having them all. Alternatively, you can see this as maybe there could be some more weapons thrown in the game.  On the bad side though;   The team-balance feature didn't really worked as you wanted it too. (Some of the options we're up to the servers admins, but not everything. And besides, it's not like there's always an admin online to help with the issues at hand.) If one team managed to claim a essential capture/spawn-point early in the game, it was not unusual it quickly became a so called base♥♥♥♥♥♥game. And then you're stuck in the rest of the game at your homebase not daring to even peak around the corner because then you'll get a snipers bullet between your eyes. But find a good server (Or host your own!) and admins can help with this issue, at least a little bit.  I myself tried to tell my team to give them one of the spawning points if it were my team that had captured them all, to give them a fair chance, and it worked at least sometimes.  I also have to give credits to the server system, it is, according to me even better than the sequel, Battlefield 3. I rarely had problem adding servers to my favorites or joining friends in just a click and getting into the same squad as them.  Bottom line; If you liked the previous Battlefield games, I don't see why you wouldn't like this one. It's a different feeling sure. But according to me, that difference was a nice change to freshen up the series. Sometimes I even preferred to boot it up instead of BF3. It's a game I warmly recommend. And there's a numerous ways to experience it, you can play really fast and all-out-action, or you can just lurk around the small ways to find around the enemies trying to take them down one by one, it's really easy to just jump in and press play, for 20 minutes, or 5 hours.

												I used to play this a lot back in 2011. I don't remember why I stopped, but I know I never will start. It was a good game probably, but EA ♥♥♥♥ed me. I'm just standing here with my hands out hoping for something, but wishing for more... No more EA games for steam. How did that happen? Why did this happen? Ron Paul warned me of this.			"

												Ok here how it goes. So I bought this game during Steam Christmas Sale 2014. At first I thought, why would I buy an old game but after hearing that BFBC2 was the best in its series I bought it. So after I install this I thought I was F*ck because when I press the multiplayer there was no server. But as I look there was this search button and suddenly there was like 5 lobby and there are still human playing this crap. I give it a try but then I found there was more server. So to conclude this review don't be afraid to buy this game as there are still people with no life like us playing this game.9/10 would play			"

												Bought this with all the DLC. The game is great but to use the Vietnam expansion one has to log into EA then enter the expansion code. Do not click in the box you're typing in or what you've already typed is deleted....why?????? Then after getting the code in when I try log in it says it cannot log in. I enter a random code and it registers as an invalid code. So it knows the difference between a valid and a false code but after entering a valid code it still won't let me access the expansion I've paid for. Thanks EA, this is the kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥why I avoid your products.Edit: Finally got the Vietnam expansion to work. Servers are ghost towns, don't know why I bothered.			"

												One of the best modern FPS I have played. It had the perfect feeling of teamwork and most people would try to play the objectives. Game runs smooth, has good hit markers and interesting maps. I have many many fond memories of this game and it is a shame that there are no longer people playing online. I hope EA follow up with another game as good as this one. The vietnam expansion was also one of the best fps addons i have had the pleasure of playing.			"

												Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is a 2010 first-person shooter video game developed by DICE and published by Electronic Arts (EA). It is a direct sequel to Battlefield: Bad Company and is part of the Battlefield game series. The game is primarily a squad-level first-person shooter based in a contemporary modern warfare setting. Additionally, the game includes a single-player campaign, where the player re-assumes the role of Preston Marlowe, the protagonist of the original game. The game's Frostbite 1.5 engine now allows for destructible environments. Multiplayer maps, which allow for five different game modes, contain a wide selection of vehicles, aircraft and emplacements. While Bad Company 2 is primarily a first-person shooter, it follows other games in the series by allowing the player to control certain vehicles, including ATVs, APCs, tanks, and helicopters. On foot, players are given access to a variety of real-world small arms such as assault rifles and machine guns. Players can also jump, crouch, and sprint. Bad Company 2 heavily emphasizes destructible environments. Large sections of most buildings can be destroyed by explosives, and some walls and fences break down under barrages of bullets, with the game's physics engine realistically simulating the destruction. Bad Company 2 features a story-driven single-player campaign. For most of the narrative, the player takes control of Preston Marlowe, one of the members of the titular ""Bad Company"". Multiplayer is class-based, with four classes: Assault, Engineer, Medic, and Recon. Each class has a variety of unique weapons and equipment, and serves a specific role in combat. There are also some weapons that can be used by any class, such as pistols and shotguns. Each class gains experience and levels up separately. Overall I rate this game a 8/10 although, the campaign may not be the best it's the multiplayer that makes me play this game. After 5 years there are still lots of people playing on the servers and it's very addicting to keep playing until you've got every single unlock in the game. I really recommend this game I am absolutely 100% sure that it will not disappoint you in anyway!.			"

You hear gunfire, explosions, helicopters, tanks and people shouting in Russian and English. -Massive maps-Very well balanced game-Great level up system that's extremely rewardingCons:-Lack of DLC, there was really only one and the maps were taken from the Campaign or recycled from BFBC1-Only two gametypes worth playing, Rush and Conquest-Not a lot of people still play, but there's at least 150 or so still on here and there.

												DeutschBattlefield Bad Comany 2Lang ist es her dass ich meine letzte Empfehlung über ein wirklich gutes Spiel geschrieben habe,was sich mit dieser hier ändern wird.In dem Spiel ""Battlefield Bad Company 2"" spielt man sich auf einer,meiner Meinung nach wirklich guten Grafik mit einem zwar vorgerenderten,jedoch gutem Zerstörungsmodell durch eine Abwechslungreichen Kampagne,die leider nicht ganz an die Story des ersten Bad Company Ablegers für Konsolen herankam,jedoch nah dran ist.Aber viel mehr geht es in diesem Spiel (für mich jedenfalls) um den Multiplayer-Modus,der meiner Meinung nach der beste ist,und nach über 3 Jahren immernoch nicht getopt wurde.Man hat eine großzügige Auswahl an Waffen,die zum Beispiel für folgende Soldaten,bei dem Sturmsoldaten 7 Gewehre bei dem Pionier 7 Machinenpistolen,bei dem Sanitäter 7 Machinengewehre und bei dem Scharfschützen 7 Scharfschützengewehre,was insgesamt somit 28 2-Handwaffen darstellen,wozu noch 6 Pistolen dazukommen die bei jeder Klasse die selbe ist,wovon aber eine zum markieren von Zielen dient.Klassenunabhängig verfügt man,insofern man alle Waffen im Spiel besitzt noch über 5 Schrotflinten,eine Thompson M1A1,ein HK G3 und ein M14,wozu noch - insofern man einen Key für ein älteres Battlefield hat - ein M1 Garand hinzukommt,das von den Amerikanern während des WK 2 in Gebrauch genommen wurde.Es gibt für jedes Gewehr/ jede Machinenpistole außer Schrotwaffen ein Red Dot und einen 4fach-Zoom,für Sniper-Waffen zusätzlich einen 12fach-Zoom für besonders Lange Distanzen.Intern im Spiel gibt es viele Auszeichnungen die das Leveln im Spiel,und generell alles an diesem interessanter und motivierender gestalten,sowie Bronze,Silber,Gold und sogar Platin-Stars für jede Waffe,die jeweils jedes mal bei erhalt Extrapunkte von 500 bis 10.000 Punkte bringen.Battlefield ist seiner selbst treu geblieben,indem es immernoch das gute alte Teamplay benötigt,da man als ""einsamer Wolf"" kaum gute Karten hat,und man kann Leute,mit denen man Spielt bzw. einmal gespielt hat adden,was das zusammenspielen durch's hinterherconnecten viel einfacher gestaltet.Die Auswahl der Server ist,wenn man vor dem erstmaligen Beginn dieses Spieles nur Call of Duty-Teile gespielt hat,eine wahrhaftige Wohltat,da man nicht einfach auf irgendwelche Maps ""abgeschoben"" wird,sondern alles schön nach Belieben filtern kann,und durch Punk Puster,ist es fast Hackerfrei,nicht wie bei CoD. - Fast,da es immer wieder leider doch Ausnahmen gibt,die sich jedoch in Grenzen halten.________________________________________________________Fazit:Wenn man bisher nur Spiele wie Counter Strike, Call of Duty oder ähnliche gewohnt ist, und immer zufrieden war, könnte man ja trotzdem mal etwas neues probieren, und wenn man sich einfach nur genervt,gestresst und auf gut deutsch angepisst von den im Fazit oben genannten Spielen fühlt, dann kann ich ihnen nur wärmstens empfehlen sich rasch dieses Spiel zu besorgen, da es, auch wenn es manchmal einige Selbstzweifel über ihren Skill aufwirft - glauben sie mir ich weiß wovon ich rede - trotzdem immer wieder Spaß macht und für mich immernoch der König der MultiplayerShooter ist, und sich eben diesen Titel redlich verdient hat!Von mir gibt es mit dieser Empfehlungen einen Daumen nach oben und eine gewissenhaft ausgewählte Kaufempfehlung,es ist sein Geld wert.________________________________________________________EnglishBattlefield Bad Comany 2It is long since I wrote my last recommendation on a really good game , what will change with this one .In the game ' Battlefield Bad Company 2 ""takes you on a , in my opinion, really good graphics with a true pre-rendered , but good destruction model through a Varied campaign , which unfortunately does not quite came up to the story of the first Bad Company offshoot for consoles, However close.But much more is what this game ( for me anyway) to the multiplayer mode, which is in my opinion the best , and was still not getopt after more than 3 years.It has a generous selection of weapons , for example, for the following soldiers ,in the Assault 7 guns in the pioneer 7 machine guns, in which paramedics 7 machine guns and sniper 7 sniper rifles , for a total thus represent 28 2 - handed weapons , which must be added six guns to come which is the same in each class , but what to highlight a used targets .Class Independent has one , so far as one all the weapons in the game still has about five shotguns, a Thompson M1A1 , an HK G3 and M14 , which must be added - so far you have a key for an older Battlefield - an M1 Garand added that while the Americans WK 2 was put into use.There are additional for each rifle / pistol every machine except shot guns a red dot and a 4x zoom for sniper weapons a 12x zoom for very long distances.Intern in the game there are many awards that the levels in the game, and generally everything about this interesting and make motivating, as well as bronze , silver, gold and even platinum stars for each weapon , each each time at preserving extra points from 500 to 10,000 points bring .Battlefield is his remained true to itself by still the good old team play needed , since one hardly has good cards as a "" lone wolf "" , and you can people with whom you play or once played adden , which together play the afterward connect with it much easier.The selection of the server, if you have only played Call of Duty parts before the first start of this game, a true blessing , because you will not simply ""dumped "" on any maps, but can filter all well at will, and by punk puffer , it's almost hacker , not like CoD . - Fast , as it unfortunately but are always exceptions , but are limited .________________________________________________________Conclusion:If you were previously only games like Counter Strike, Call of Duty or similar is used , and always satisfied , you still might even try something new , and if you just annoyed , stressed and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on good German top of the Verdict these games, feels , then I can give them highly recommend quickly to get this game since it , even if it sometimes raises some self-doubt about their skill - believe me I know what I'm talking about - there will always be fun and for me still the king of multiplayer shooter is , and has just earned this title honestly !From me there with these recommendations, a thumbs up and a scrupulously selected purchase recommendation ,it is worth the money.

												This game is a real piece of work, not necessarily in a bad way though. The Singleplayer experience is okay, its got a pretty decent story spanning ww2 and modern day war scenarios, even has you crash a satellite and recover its black box.It's version of the Battlefield Frostbite engine allows for completly destroying buildings with c4, instead of the more modern one seen in battlefield 3 and even battlefield 4 where only bits and pieces of buildings can be destroyed(not counting the specific scripted events in battlefield 4 where you can demolish a skyscraper or blow up a dam).It's Multiplayer aspect is a bit lacking, there is no proning, there is a very bad latency problem which only seems to clear up if you run this game with a medium to top tier computer and wookies (ghillie suit snipers) dominate most maps.Its business model is a bit bad, as it has 2 DLC, one adds a new map and weapons and thats fine, but the other unlocks all the top tier weapons for each class, or rather provides you with exact replicas.Note that the weapons which are unlocked are top tier but aren't necessarily the best weapons in the game.Overall even though this game like all games has its flaws and some are worse than others, it's still worth looking into and playing with friends.Personally find the ""have your friend take the uav and put a ♥♥♥♥ton of c4 on it and slam it into the M-COM"" to be quite enjoyable.As this is as always a personal opinion i'd give this game a 7/10, its a pretty decent game without game breaking bugs worth referencing, just slight inconviniences.

												DeutschBattlefield Bad Comany 2Lang ist es her dass ich meine letzte Empfehlung über ein wirklich gutes Spiel geschrieben habe,was sich mit dieser hier ändern wird.In dem Spiel ""Battlefield Bad Company 2"" spielt man sich auf einer,meiner Meinung nach wirklich guten Grafik mit einem zwar vorgerenderten,jedoch gutem Zerstörungsmodell durch eine Abwechslungreichen Kampagne,die leider nicht ganz an die Story des ersten Bad Company Ablegers für Konsolen herankam,jedoch nah dran ist.Aber viel mehr geht es in diesem Spiel (für mich jedenfalls) um den Multiplayer-Modus,der meiner Meinung nach der beste ist,und nach über 3 Jahren immernoch nicht getopt wurde.Man hat eine großzügige Auswahl an Waffen,die zum Beispiel für folgende Soldaten,bei dem Sturmsoldaten 7 Gewehre bei dem Pionier 7 Machinenpistolen,bei dem Sanitäter 7 Machinengewehre und bei dem Scharfschützen 7 Scharfschützengewehre,was insgesamt somit 28 2-Handwaffen darstellen,wozu noch 6 Pistolen dazukommen die bei jeder Klasse die selbe ist,wovon aber eine zum markieren von Zielen dient.Klassenunabhängig verfügt man,insofern man alle Waffen im Spiel besitzt noch über 5 Schrotflinten,eine Thompson M1A1,ein HK G3 und ein M14,wozu noch - insofern man einen Key für ein älteres Battlefield hat - ein M1 Garand hinzukommt,das von den Amerikanern während des WK 2 in Gebrauch genommen wurde.Es gibt für jedes Gewehr/ jede Machinenpistole außer Schrotwaffen ein Red Dot und einen 4fach-Zoom,für Sniper-Waffen zusätzlich einen 12fach-Zoom für besonders Lange Distanzen.Intern im Spiel gibt es viele Auszeichnungen die das Leveln im Spiel,und generell alles an diesem interessanter und motivierender gestalten,sowie Bronze,Silber,Gold und sogar Platin-Stars für jede Waffe,die jeweils jedes mal bei erhalt Extrapunkte von 500 bis 10.000 Punkte bringen.Battlefield ist seiner selbst treu geblieben,indem es immernoch das gute alte Teamplay benötigt,da man als ""einsamer Wolf"" kaum gute Karten hat,und man kann Leute,mit denen man Spielt bzw. einmal gespielt hat adden,was das zusammenspielen durch's hinterherconnecten viel einfacher gestaltet.Die Auswahl der Server ist,wenn man vor dem erstmaligen Beginn dieses Spieles nur Call of Duty-Teile gespielt hat,eine wahrhaftige Wohltat,da man nicht einfach auf irgendwelche Maps ""abgeschoben"" wird,sondern alles schön nach Belieben filtern kann,und durch Punk Puster,ist es fast Hackerfrei,nicht wie bei CoD. - Fast,da es immer wieder leider doch Ausnahmen gibt,die sich jedoch in Grenzen halten.________________________________________________________Fazit:Wenn man bisher nur Spiele wie Counter Strike, Call of Duty oder ähnliche gewohnt ist, und immer zufrieden war, könnte man ja trotzdem mal etwas neues probieren, und wenn man sich einfach nur genervt,gestresst und auf gut deutsch angepisst von den im Fazit oben genannten Spielen fühlt, dann kann ich ihnen nur wärmstens empfehlen sich rasch dieses Spiel zu besorgen, da es, auch wenn es manchmal einige Selbstzweifel über ihren Skill aufwirft - glauben sie mir ich weiß wovon ich rede - trotzdem immer wieder Spaß macht und für mich immernoch der König der MultiplayerShooter ist, und sich eben diesen Titel redlich verdient hat!Von mir gibt es mit dieser Empfehlungen einen Daumen nach oben und eine gewissenhaft ausgewählte Kaufempfehlung,es ist sein Geld wert.________________________________________________________EnglishBattlefield Bad Comany 2It is long since I wrote my last recommendation on a really good game , what will change with this one .In the game ' Battlefield Bad Company 2 ""takes you on a , in my opinion, really good graphics with a true pre-rendered , but good destruction model through a Varied campaign , which unfortunately does not quite came up to the story of the first Bad Company offshoot for consoles, However close.But much more is what this game ( for me anyway) to the multiplayer mode, which is in my opinion the best , and was still not getopt after more than 3 years.It has a generous selection of weapons , for example, for the following soldiers ,in the Assault 7 guns in the pioneer 7 machine guns, in which paramedics 7 machine guns and sniper 7 sniper rifles , for a total thus represent 28 2 - handed weapons , which must be added six guns to come which is the same in each class , but what to highlight a used targets .Class Independent has one , so far as one all the weapons in the game still has about five shotguns, a Thompson M1A1 , an HK G3 and M14 , which must be added - so far you have a key for an older Battlefield - an M1 Garand added that while the Americans WK 2 was put into use.There are additional for each rifle / pistol every machine except shot guns a red dot and a 4x zoom for sniper weapons a 12x zoom for very long distances.Intern in the game there are many awards that the levels in the game, and generally everything about this interesting and make motivating, as well as bronze , silver, gold and even platinum stars for each weapon , each each time at preserving extra points from 500 to 10,000 points bring .Battlefield is his remained true to itself by still the good old team play needed , since one hardly has good cards as a "" lone wolf "" , and you can people with whom you play or once played adden , which together play the afterward connect with it much easier.The selection of the server, if you have only played Call of Duty parts before the first start of this game, a true blessing , because you will not simply ""dumped "" on any maps, but can filter all well at will, and by punk puffer , it's almost hacker , not like CoD . - Fast , as it unfortunately but are always exceptions , but are limited .________________________________________________________Conclusion:If you were previously only games like Counter Strike, Call of Duty or similar is used , and always satisfied , you still might even try something new , and if you just annoyed , stressed and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on good German top of the Verdict these games, feels , then I can give them highly recommend quickly to get this game since it , even if it sometimes raises some self-doubt about their skill - believe me I know what I'm talking about - there will always be fun and for me still the king of multiplayer shooter is , and has just earned this title honestly !From me there with these recommendations, a thumbs up and a scrupulously selected purchase recommendation ,it is worth the money.

												Bad Company 2 is probably the best battlefield game I have ever played (I didn't have the fortune of playing Battlefield 2). I put over 1200 hours into it on Xbox ages ago and picked it up on PC. It's still got a pretty active community so it's never too hard to hop into a game. The gunplay is nice, each gone definitely has a different feel compared to other games like Call of Duty where one gun clearly outlevels the others. The level design is fantastic. Wide, large areas traversible by vehicle and foot. Good amounts of cover by buildings and foliage alike make for tactical strategies in order to complete objectives. I've had some of the most gratifying gaming moments in history by free shooting Carl Gustavs at enemy helos. If there is one FPS people need to play, it is this game.			"

												I had played this for atleast 500+ hours on xbox 360 and have to say it is my favorite Battlefield game i have played. Everything about it is a pro, except you can't go prone, which you get over fairly fast. No hardcore battlefield fan can hate this game and its way better than any recent battlefield game by far, but sadly its dying out fast. There are few servers and most of the poeple that are still playing are just dicking around or have instense rules. Please Dice remake this amazing game!			"

												Easily the best Battlefield game and probably one of the best FPS games made to this day in regards to feel, operability, and gameplay.Battlefield 3 - nope. Battlefield 4 - nope. Battlefield HL - nope. Battlefield 5 - NOPE. Battlefield 2? it held up pretty well in comparison.Good luck making a BF game that will have a fraction of the charm that this one does. DICE has obviously lost it in both the gameplay department and the ideas department. There will probably never be another this entertaining to watch and fun to play.BFBC2 - the only one that is not a suckerfield.			"

												After giving up on the fallen franchise ""Call of Duty."" I moved on to Battlefield. First thing I want to say: this game is fun. The story might be a little chessy, but the mutiplayer what's up. Before I on moved to this game, people say it's hard to drive a helicopter and jet, and heck yes it is. Everytime I try to use it, I always end up crashing and fliping side ways. The mutiplayer maps of this game are BIG, and they have vehicles.. It's something CoD should have done, but they've move on with the money road now.The campaign isn't bad. It's actually good. I just didn't feel emotions within the characters. But that's not all to say, they do have a couple of humor dialog into this as well, and it is funny. The Vietnam pack is fun aswell, of course you don't have some equipments that the modern Bad Company 2 has, becuase it is set in the 60's. The game is fun for me, and mutiplayer is awesome. I'm going to give Battlefield: Bad Company 2 8/10.			"

Still good to this day.Story: 8/10 You're back with the crew from the first game. Although, the first game wasn't on PC, you don't need to know what happened in the first game. The story is pretty good.Multiplayer Experience: 10/10 Again with that teamwork thing. The gamemodes are brilliant. The maps are brilliant. The gun play is brilliant. Everything is brilliant.Single player Experience: 8/10 Great fun except for some snow missions. Think of it as multiplayer but less fun.Overall (Average): 8.6/10 I extremely recommend this game as it's very fun, especially with friends.			"

												This game is a real piece of work, not necessarily in a bad way though. The Singleplayer experience is okay, its got a pretty decent story spanning ww2 and modern day war scenarios, even has you crash a satellite and recover its black box.It's version of the Battlefield Frostbite engine allows for completly destroying buildings with c4, instead of the more modern one seen in battlefield 3 and even battlefield 4 where only bits and pieces of buildings can be destroyed(not counting the specific scripted events in battlefield 4 where you can demolish a skyscraper or blow up a dam).It's Multiplayer aspect is a bit lacking, there is no proning, there is a very bad latency problem which only seems to clear up if you run this game with a medium to top tier computer and wookies (ghillie suit snipers) dominate most maps.Its business model is a bit bad, as it has 2 DLC, one adds a new map and weapons and thats fine, but the other unlocks all the top tier weapons for each class, or rather provides you with exact replicas.Note that the weapons which are unlocked are top tier but aren't necessarily the best weapons in the game.Overall even though this game like all games has its flaws and some are worse than others, it's still worth looking into and playing with friends.Personally find the ""have your friend take the uav and put a ♥♥♥♥ton of c4 on it and slam it into the M-COM"" to be quite enjoyable.As this is as always a personal opinion i'd give this game a 7/10, its a pretty decent game without game breaking bugs worth referencing, just slight inconviniences.

												As of January 6th, 2016, the game is still active. There's over a dozen full servers depending on what region you queue in.That being said, the pings that are displayed in the server browser and your in-game ping do not match up. Whatever ping you see in the server browser, double it, and that will be your ping in-game.Most of the people who are left playing this live in countries with awful internet latency. I think the average ping of an adversary is somewhere around 180, which makes it frustrating to play because your bullets will seem like they don't exist, and it will seem like you're dying in one or two hits.Survive up until rank 15 and it becomes playable, since you unlock magnum rounds. At least then your bullet damage will increase and the few bullets that register will be worth more damage.The game is still largely the same. I owned it on PS3 and I wanted to give it a go on PC since it was $5. I wouldn't buy this for $20, but it was an alright price for what I got it for. It's still fun. Annoying with the whole ping thing, but fun nonetheless.			"

												the Best Battlefield ever!++ graphics are really good - frostbite 1.5 - and it still looks good despite being nearly 5 years old++ best destruction ever in any battlefield - even bf3 and 4 do not have as good building destruction as this one++ challenging and still alive multiplayer gameplay++ Vietnam DLC is the best! <<for some gameplay videos check out my  vids >>++ more variety of weapons than bf3 & 4 - in bf3 & 4 you have many 5.56x45 mm NATO catridge weapons, all sound the same and perform the same way. but in this you actually have more weapons with 7.62x51 mm, like G3 and MG3!++ nothing got nerfed! ++ HardCore Mode is the best++ Heavy Metal is the biggest map ever in my opinion. cant find any map bigger than this in bf3 or 4.++ Vietnam DLC maps have many places to hide and its more tactical than any other bfs++ epic Vietnam era sondtracks and radio hits in Vietnam DLC.. - trun on the radio in your M48 and burn the Commies down with your flamethrower while listening to CCR's Fortunate Son!!!!++ AK47!++ no stupid attachments for your weapon like BF3 & 4.. no, you cant have supressor, laser and god-knows-what on your LMG! - only military grade weapons, iron sight feels the most realistic!++ It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no senator's son, son      It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no !!!++ Charlie Down!!

												This game is a real piece of work, not necessarily in a bad way though. The Singleplayer experience is okay, its got a pretty decent story spanning ww2 and modern day war scenarios, even has you crash a satellite and recover its black box.It's version of the Battlefield Frostbite engine allows for completly destroying buildings with c4, instead of the more modern one seen in battlefield 3 and even battlefield 4 where only bits and pieces of buildings can be destroyed(not counting the specific scripted events in battlefield 4 where you can demolish a skyscraper or blow up a dam).It's Multiplayer aspect is a bit lacking, there is no proning, there is a very bad latency problem which only seems to clear up if you run this game with a medium to top tier computer and wookies (ghillie suit snipers) dominate most maps.Its business model is a bit bad, as it has 2 DLC, one adds a new map and weapons and thats fine, but the other unlocks all the top tier weapons for each class, or rather provides you with exact replicas.Note that the weapons which are unlocked are top tier but aren't necessarily the best weapons in the game.Overall even though this game like all games has its flaws and some are worse than others, it's still worth looking into and playing with friends.Personally find the ""have your friend take the uav and put a ♥♥♥♥ton of c4 on it and slam it into the M-COM"" to be quite enjoyable.As this is as always a personal opinion i'd give this game a 7/10, its a pretty decent game without game breaking bugs worth referencing, just slight inconviniences.

Still lots of servers are function very well and the battle is hectic as ♥♥♥♥ - so no reason to play any other shooters in my book. Highly recommended if you like large battlefields, destructional buildings, and tactical team play. 10/10 would be in a bad company again :P			"

												Hands down the best battlefield game I've played. The great level design for multiplayer is up most amazing. This is definitely the best battlefield game to date. It keeps its simple and fun. The community on this game is still booming thiers tons of servers going between rush and conquest (the most popular). Now about Vietnam probably the best DLC that has ever released for any game. Its just pure awsomeness. The only problem with this is that when i was trying to find servers (yes i dont have tons of play time) but their was only a few servers to pick from. If your on the fence about this game by it when it goes on sale for $5-$10 its definitely worth it.			"

												I have always been a bigger fan of the Medal of Honor and Battlefield games as opposed to Call of Duty. So my review may be biased, but I love this game. The destructable environments engrain in your mind one thing, nowhere is safe. The Singleplayer campaign is awesome with great story, characters, and graphics. Lots of replayability. The multiplayer is fun as well. I highly suggest buying the Vietnam expansion. Worth every penny.			"

												Battlefield is a great series, don't get me wrong on that. But with all EA titles... there are kickers that will make you think twice.The game is the best when you look at it from a technical standpoint. Blow up cover that enemies might be hiding behind... that has to be the most satisfying thing to do. No more camping is to be seen when the whole building is gone.As the game progressed through it's cycle, it seems to be left in a buggy state. Almost by reason. Fences and grass can be seen in houses, coming out of the floor. After countless hours, I had only found this later on. Maybe a new title had something to do with it?No real point in getting the game. Just like Nuclear Dawn, the game has come and gone. There's no real community, it's moved on to BF3, now BF4. Look at this game as a collector's item, nothing more. Story for single player isn't worth the time. Quick and painless, get's you ready for multiplayer which no longer exists.7.5/10			"

												This is my third purchase of the game. I've been playing it since its release on the Xbox 360 back in 2010. This is by far my favorite Battlefield title to date and I'm looking forward to a third installment. The verteran system was amazing before they came up with the Premium service and the Vietnam DLC / Expansion was a perfect example of how DLC content should be as it was ahead of its time. 10/10 three times in a row so I'll call this one a 30/30.

												The singleplayer is fun but the multiplayer is the real experience.One of the better FPS in my opinion, it sets itself apart by focusing more on the teamwork aspect of multiplayer. It does this via the class system implemented in the game, this allows teams to work efficiently if everyone picks the corresponding class and attributes to it. It's a simple additional mechanic when you look at it but, it is that exact same simple mechanic that keeps me coming for more.Note : I recommend not buying the Vietnam DLC as it can be played by simply searching for a Vietnam server without the DLC.

												I've only played the single player campaign (twice) so I can only comment on that. I thought it was pretty enjoyable. The gunplay very tight and satisfying, the vehicles fun to drive, and lots of weapons to discover and switch around.The COD games and BF games all have the same approach to their single player campaigns where you feel like your hand is being held and you're moving from setpiece to setpiece. Everything is so staged, linear and orchestrated. But as long as you choose to accept that, this game is pretty fun. You can up the difficulty if you feel it's too accomodating.the Bad Company games are beloved offshoot of Battlefield because the characters that accompany you during the campaign are fun to listen to, and the story is sometimes funny. I like the idle conversations that take place if you stand around with them, too.In short, definitely worth getting for the single player, if you don't mind the ""theme park ride"" campaign.			"

I don't know if it's the sounds, the feeling no concrete surface will exist for more than 10 seconds, the likable cast of actually fleshed out characters in your squad, or just being able to pick up a rocket launcher and shout ""F*** your cover!""Either way, this game is still a gem.

												Well balanced shooter-no weapon or class is best. Vehicles such as gunships aren't indestructible, but with teamwork and cooperation (Going solo in a tank or chopper isnt as rewarding as having teammates by your side) , they aren't useless either. Maps are pretty well designed. Some of the maps for rush could be built better for defending teams (eg taking MCOMs out of destructible buildings) but none will disappoint. Some maps are designed solely for one game mode, while others are made for all game modes. The latter works suprisingly well.The game looks fab, and even rivals BF3 in some areas (COLOUR). The destruction in BC2 still stellar and watching buildings topple never gets old. And its more than just eye candy-its always modifying a map, in terms fo where you can/cant go. Its a big part of gameplay.Apart from the single player campaign (which isn't awful, but not amazing either), there's little thats bad about BFBC2. The multiplayer community is still thriving so go buy it now!And on a side note, no god-awful Origin or Battlelog b0llocks!			"

												Even after almost 5 years, this game still rocks. Haven't played the singleplayer campaign so far, but that's not why you're going to buy this game - the multiplayer is. Writing this in 1Q 2015, there's still a plenty of active servers with hundreds of players. Fun is guaranteed, especially when playing with friends. The only downside is that the achievements aren't connected with steam account, but hey, we haven't expect that from the EA anyway.On sales, the price is around $2.5 and it's absolutely a steal!10/10 would buy again.

												The best FPS in the Battlefield series. None other's like it. Also you don't need Origin. Plenty of active players still on so no problems finding a mostly full to full server. Hardcore mode is the best way to play. All 4 classes are well balanced. Trees and buildings are almost all destructable. Pass on Battlefield 4, and be apart of the BC community.			"

Arguably the best Battlefield gameWhy?- It is not that casual of a shooter as the other Battlefield games, as there are not that many gadgets that make it easy to kill other players. For example, the Javelin and remote mortar.- The different classes had the most appropriate equipment to their class and it made sense. Assualt players gave out ammo and had C4. Supoprt players had the role of dropping health and reviving people.- Recoil and bullet spread played a key factor in this game. For example, firing an automatic gun for a long duration of time meant that it would be quite difficult to kill the enemy.- The map design in this game is well designed so that the game modes flow well and the change in the dynamic of battle is apparent a team gets the upper hand- If one were to invest time into playing this game then the player would feel like they have been challenged and rewarded/content with the game.Therefore I highly recommend getting this game as it is the most rewarding experience and it requires the most skill :)			"

												I think this game is great. Its not the newest Battlefield game so I can run it with few fps/lag issues. Gameplay I think is good, but sometimes just too fast, like compared to BF3 or BF4. Mostly in this game I like to snipe because Im more a stealthy person than assaulting, because its more calm (and higher framerate). There are still lots of servers and even Vietnam DLC servers as a mod and you just join it :) Like in any other Battlefield game happens epic moments and that kinda stuff, I've already headshotted 2 helicopter pilots with M24. I recommend buying this if you dont want to use Origin and you want to use Steam. Game is very fun with friends too, but I dont have them so I dont know what it feels like (			"

												The Physics, The Guns, The Teamplay, and THE VIETNAM DLC!!!! the campaign was a bit on the meh side but where this game trully shined was in the multiplayer. Working together with a solid squad could definitely move mountains in this gem of a Battlefield title. Wish It could receive more love from the communty this valentine's day :)			"

												Turns out the multiplayer in this is still alive. Surprising. So if you want to play a Battlefield game and not have to put up with Origin, then you can play this. It's pretty good, though I am hopelessly bad at it. XDSpeaking of hopelessly bad, the singleplayer campaign in this is even worse than Modern Warfare 2's was. So basically you get this for multiplayer and nothing else. Also go ahead and get the Vietnam expansion thing for this as well, since that's even better than the base game's multiplayer. Have fun!

												Disappointing. I keep buying Battlefield games trying to find one that's as fun as the original BF1942. This, like the others, is not it. I find the single player campaign ridiculously stupid. Seriously, I can feel my brain dripping out of my ears playing this game. Battlefield games should NOT have a single player ANYTHING.I tried the multiplayer, and could not get the hang of it.. Very, very frustrating. It is clear though that MP in BFBC2 offers more depth of strategy than most.Look, I generally do not enjoy military shooters, so I understand that I'm not the target audience. If you like these games, then rock on with your bad self and buy this puppy. You will probably enjoy it more than I did.			"

Arguably the best Battlefield gameWhy?- It is not that casual of a shooter as the other Battlefield games, as there are not that many gadgets that make it easy to kill other players. For example, the Javelin and remote mortar.- The different classes had the most appropriate equipment to their class and it made sense. Assualt players gave out ammo and had C4. Supoprt players had the role of dropping health and reviving people.- Recoil and bullet spread played a key factor in this game. For example, firing an automatic gun for a long duration of time meant that it would be quite difficult to kill the enemy.- The map design in this game is well designed so that the game modes flow well and the change in the dynamic of battle is apparent a team gets the upper hand- If one were to invest time into playing this game then the player would feel like they have been challenged and rewarded/content with the game.Therefore I highly recommend getting this game as it is the most rewarding experience and it requires the most skill :)			"

												I think this game is great. Its not the newest Battlefield game so I can run it with few fps/lag issues. Gameplay I think is good, but sometimes just too fast, like compared to BF3 or BF4. Mostly in this game I like to snipe because Im more a stealthy person than assaulting, because its more calm (and higher framerate). There are still lots of servers and even Vietnam DLC servers as a mod and you just join it :) Like in any other Battlefield game happens epic moments and that kinda stuff, I've already headshotted 2 helicopter pilots with M24. I recommend buying this if you dont want to use Origin and you want to use Steam. Game is very fun with friends too, but I dont have them so I dont know what it feels like (			"

												For some reason, it seems like it's really hard for EA and DICE to replicate the raw beauty of Bad Company 2. Or maybe they're just lazy. Campaign To quote Anthony Gallegos, ""It was a blast!"" The writing was very good, and there was a perfect mixture of maturity and humor. The only problem I really had was the overall short length of it, about 3-5 hours max. Other than that, I 100% recommend this game's campaign! Multiplayer To be honest, the maps were a bit smaller than usual (I would've preferred something like Battlefield 4's Siege of Shanghai), and as far as I know, there are sadly no jet fighters to fly around in, but I can assure you, that does not make the multiplayer any less fun or enjoyable.  Vietnam  Honestly, I was rather disappointed by the expansion pack. Even now, EA\DICE are presenting it as something that expands on the Bad Company 2 experience, but instead, what I found was a short list of maps. ""But, but Tykylo! Itz Viatnahm! Dat meanz all of the pack's sinz r washd away, u fooking idiut! Y shuld we lizten to u, anywayz, u hav a CoD picture on ur prophile!!""  No, the Vietnam setting does not magically fix that problem, and attacking my profile pic does not qualify as constructive criticism. ""U foking idiut, Im dun wit u!"" Okay, bai.  Final Verdict This is a pretty tough one, because I personally love this game for all it is, but I don't want to get too biased about it. Overall, the Bad Company series has had a good reputation, and this one deserves a 8.9/10 from me. Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is basically Battlefield 4 but better. Get this one and the first Bad Company if you're interested. leave the newer Battlefield games to rot.			"

												The Battlefield series has got to be one of the most detailed FPS i have ever played and battlefield: Bad company 2 is no different! The game has some amazing physics letting you use your surroundings as a lethal weapon. Also, the graphics on this game are crystal clear showing you in HD how war effects your surroundings. There are also a wide range if different characters from serious to being funny, to stupid to being very clever! And we cant forget about the guns and vehicles. The guns are highley detailed and fit perfevtly into the game adding more realism to the game. And the vehicles have had alot of attention on them too seeing that they look amazing too! The story is perfect for any new beginers to the series and the multiplayer is just pure beautiful! If you are wondering wether to buy this game you should definetly but this one in the cart and check it out because i can guarantee endless fun with this game! Wether fighting the terrorists off in story or capturing towns in multiplayer you will have something to do in this game! 5/5 from me! Thanks for reading "

												BUENO: Definitivamente la mejor campaña que he jugado (en juegos bélicos). Tiene una buena historia, buenos graficos y sobre todo bastante detalle. Durante la campaña te encontraras con un sinfin de maneras de morir si lo juegas en las dificultades superiores. Habra momentos que si te quedas afk los personajes de tu patrulla comenzaran a charlar sobre temas cotidianos y graciosos como viajes de pesca, momentos incomodos al preguntar a tu comandante afroamericano, de peliculas muy conocidas, etc. Los personajes tienen actitudes y personalidades muy realistas y cada uno posee su toque personal de encanto. Si lo que buscas es una gran campaña te recomiendo este juego.MALO: El online....si asi es, el online a pesar de haber sido de renombre en el pasado, hoy ya tiene muy pocos servidores en linea y muy poca cantidad de jugadores, para encontrar un servidor con usuarios deberas cambiar los filtros de busqueda, pero nada que te impida una gran partida si la encuentras. El ambiente: a pesar de que dine que la campaña esta muy bien lograda hay....una pequeña cuestion, las casas. Son todas iguales por dentro..pero cuando digo iguales, es que son iguales...puede que por fuera parescan distintas pero si las miras en detalle veras que tambien son parecidas.RESUMEN:*Buena campaña, misiones muy emocionantes y adictivas*Online con pocos servers y jugadores*Ambientes elaborados, salvo por las casas.*COMPRALO!!!

												One of the best game of the Battlefield series, but I think Battlefield 3 beats it.Non-repetitive gameplay, good physics, every mission is in a totally new zone and seasons. Buildings are getting destroyed when you shoot them. Also, it has really good graphics for a 2010 game, beign extremely optimised.I played it for the story, and I was very surprised that the story is soo good!The multiplayer is fun too, but Isn't that good, this game is perfect for his Campaign.Overall 9/10			"

												this game is an fps game like every fps game , except that it has been made in the frostbite engine which makes the graphics looks almost near the reality the game also has a weapon upgrading/unlocking  depending on your rank in 4 classes  , vehicules included the multiplayer isn't dead  , its fine thanks to the punk buster system in this game we could have a nice gameplay and clean from hackers ( or almost ) it deserves alot of love , no crashing , no lags .....its a truly war simulator ( ignore the respawning part , everything you need in a war is there in this game , weapons , vehicules , classes ...)10/10			"

												Bad Company 2 is an amazing Call of Duty alternative that will blow you away with its in-depth game play and teamwork core game mechanics. If you are buying Bad Company 2 just for its single player campaign, prepare to be deeply disappointed. The single player is actually very fun with hilarious characters, but it is extremely short. The single player actually feels like a tutorial where you get the feel for the all the guns available in the game. Bad Company 2 makes up for this through its multiplayer feature. Let me tell you, it’s an enormous step up from battlefield 2. The server search menu is impressive, almost like steam’s own server search engine. This game actually requires teamwork on the battlefield unlike that trash kiddies play nowadays. Now that I play bad company 2, I actually gag whenever someone tells me that Black Ops is a good game. Get real.			"

												10/10 Amazing game with amazing gunplay. Real high replay value aswell, i always come back to the game quite frequent for the amazing multiplayer experience that it has to offer. I highly recommend any FPS fan to get this game, you will not be dissapointed. The game is of course a bit old so the game is no longer supported, so somethings may still be a bit annoying/buggy like for example the ""zoom out while ADS(aiming down sight)"" which can be annoying. But overall its fairly balanced(except for the OP Saiga 12). So i'd suggest you get the game, either if its on Steam or Origin. I'd recommend Origin since its cheaper there(price depends on where you live, for example in Norway its cheaper on Origin and more expensive on Steam, but its the same price on both Steam and Origin in the US).

												This game came out before it's time, in my opinion it looks better than Battlefield 3 and I'm not afraid to say that because this game is just amazing. Battlefield: Bad Company 2, is by far the best Battlefield game released thus far. The game continues on from the previous Bad Company title with the same characters and they are just as hilarious and fun to play as they were in the previous Bad Company title. When DICE released the Vietnam addon, the community went crazy because it was just... Something that all Battlefield fans, hell all shooter fans had wanted it for a long time and DICE was happy to deliver.If you want a fun story to play, with awesome characters, gorgeous visuals and great Multiplayer, then Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is your game.Note: As of 3/8/14 the Multiplayer is pretty much dead, which is extremely sad because this game is just amazing in every way however you will occasionally find some fellow players, who love the game just as much as you will.

												This game is one of the best in the franchise. It is well worth the money, but when its on sale, it is even better. The game seems to bring a nostagic factor, but is still a modern shooter, which is great. I would recommend this game for people that are new to first-person shooters, casual gamers, and veterans of the newer Battlefield (3 and 4) games. If you buy BFBC2, only buy the Vietnam DLC on sale because it is not worth the $15. When it is on sale it is way worth it, there just arent that many playing it regualarly anymore.			"

												Simply put, the best multiplayer fps experience I've ever had. It was pure fun all along for the 300 hours or more I put into this game. Contrary to a lot of other fps, or any other battlefield game for the matter, I never really felt frustrated playing bad company 2. It was always fun, fast paced and never felt linear. You can see players from across the map if you look carefully and that's something I liked about this game. The maps were nice, not too tight, not too big and all around really well balanced. There was always a lot of action going on too. The squad death match mode was the only squad death match mode in a battlefield game that I ever felt was balanced and fun. I played other battlefield games before that and Battlefield 3 and 4, both for more than 300 hours, and I can tell you BC2 Fun Factor was off the charts compared to those other titles.Hope DICE comes out with another gem like this in a near future.

												Back in it's hayday on xbox 360, this was the top competitor with Call of Duty. This game, however, required much more team work and involved much more realism with destructable environments and bullet drop physics. The campaign felt ropey taking 4 unprofessional rednecks through unlikely missions but the online was huge . . . before battlefield 3 and 4.Sadly since then, Battlfield 3 and now 4 is where the action is at (which you'll have to play through origin). Although, saying that, Battlefield 3 & 4 has kept the same great online formula but improved it in pretty much every way.Just steer clear of Battlfield Hardline. You'll be glad you did			"

												This game represents the high point of my skills in FPS games.  Nothing will compare to a game where i completly stalled an entire enemy team with nothing more that an SV-98 with a x4 scope.  Headshot, Headshot, Headshot.  The guns feel extremely realistic but at the same time they are a complete joy to use.  And the best part??  There is no ONE gun that completly outpreforms the rest, every gun has has its advantages and disadvantages, and its all up to preferance.  Only 3 attachments really, 4 if you count the grenade launchers.  A red dot sight, a x4 scope, and a x12 scope for snipers.  those are cross weapon, so you don't have to have 100 kills with the M60 in order to use the red dot sight for it (which, BTW is a must since its irons suck).  all and all it is the greatest battlefield before EA started exerting creative control over DICE.

												Campaign has a good start but gets tedious and aimless after a while. Too many cutscenes after only a small progress seem just bizzare. Technically quite demanding and has its share of small bugs making hard difficulty unforgiving and unfair sometimes. Graphics are quite gorgeous and the impressive destructable environment together with great sound offer a satisfying battlefield experience.			"

												Bought the game as replacement for Battlefield 1942 (where 2142 and some others failed!).I still am missing the ability to board ships, but beyond that it does a good job of being a generally good FPS.The SP-campaign is nearly brilliant! Some well placed heavilly scripped segments keep things fresh and its all layered with comm-chatter from you and your team.MP is well enough balanced, though you may want to find some 'XP x 15' servers untill you are lvl15 or above just to get most gear unlocked (at least for your favourite class). It has minor issues with base-camping and sniper-heavy teams, but wich FPS doesnt?Even nooblets can do well since the game has players move fairly slow and 'bunnyhopping' is not very usefull.			"

												In my opinion this game is currently (2011) the most enjoyable first person shooter on the market. If your computer can handle the graphics (they're intense) than you will not be disappointed. Although some may prefer the mindless fast-paced killing that exists in the Call of Duty Modern Warfare franchise, I find that this game provides a much more fulfilling experience. It requires more skill and foresight to fully enjoy, but if you are willing to put the time and effort (it takes patience - not running and gunning) into learning how to play you will appreciate the difference in gameplay and style. Although there is a single-player campaign, this game is primarily a multiplayer game. The single player campaign is mediocre but enjoyable (nothing like COD's excitement) but the multiplayer is where the game really shines. The fully destructible environments create an experience where every match can be different and you can surprise your opponents at the flip of a coin. 10/10 stars.			"

One day I hope for BC3, but until then, this is the best BF on the market. I paid $5 during the summer sale after already playing this on consoles and am totally satisfied. The online community is still there and alive. I'd love DICE to get back to this formula. Great campaign, great multiplayer. Do yourself a favor and buy this game. The campaign is alone worth the $.

												JUST a great experience. That's ALL!Battlefield Bad Company 2 (BBC2) is a normal shooter military game. I had to play a shooter for years because of my strategy game taste and I decided to see where things had come. Well, the game is good. I think the multiplayer part, these games were designed for, is even better.Electronic Arts as always has made pretty good job on the graphics sector. The guns are pretty good. The soldiers' figures, the environment like trees, rocks, grass or whatever. The sounds are very normal in comparison with reality. Explosions, gun sounds, soldiers' voices, helicopter and plane sounds, all of them great.The story mode is weird. You continue to fight against the foes to find a secret weapon. A plane with cloak ability containing a great EMP pulse weapon of some sort. One gets another like a team when someone tries to go away from the cause saying that all finished. It's not bad , but NOT real anyway... lolLet's go to the point... GUNS and GUN fights. You'll have much gun play here. You'll find the one suited to your needs. Weapons with different aiming, precision, firepower, ammo, and reload times. I personally liked the heavy machine guns with the precision scopes even if without the scopes were more natural. Have you ever seen a very precised machine gun? NOoooooo. Can you carry an MG-3 with 200 rounds or an M60 with 500 rounds. They both weight about 10 kg WITHOUT the rounds. And you can use them almost as snipers do. Or you can move along with a scope in your eye.... LOL.. Totally fake. Or maybe you are a SUPER soldier.... Anyway.. It's fun because it's a game. Another point you won't like is RPG's or missile launchers.They are totally inaccurate and a tank needs 2 or more to die. This is an issue because you'll find yourself completely pinned down and you will be unable to do anything sometimes. With those weapons you fight tanks and helicopters, yeah you read right, helicopters. There is even a level that you have to do with two helies at the same time. You have some missile launchers at the borders of a base, but as they have guided missiles, the helies can avoid them. And at the same time you have infantry on your back, GREAT or HELL? The ONLY way to get down those helies was running among the ruins for cover and shoot with my OWN missile launcher. And everyone of them needs 2-3 shots to die, totally unnatural. The only weapon that fullfills its promise is the great sniper weapon. But this one fires Km far away. So, GOOD gun play but totally fake game.As much for the environment. Feeling like you are in a battlefield is NOT an easy case. So EA made everything destructable. Almost everything can be destroyed. You walk among the ruins and there are gas barrels or FULL tanks of trucks in the level. If you shoot at them they blow up. If you shoot at anything with heavy weapons it will be destroyed, buildings too.ONLY rocks and terrains is inpenetrable and undestructable. Another thing a player likes but it's totally unreal is that the same soldies can drive trucks, helies, ATVs, to be a gunner on them, drive a TANK with BOTH AT shells and against personnel. I mean OK, you HAVE to be a SUPER soldier. Am I playing Battlefield or Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Duke Nukem or Crysis? Has anyone of you played Super Trench Attack? If NOT search some walkthrough videos till the training and with it. You'll laugh so MUCH... You are the guy! The ONLY hero we have!So, after so .... much reality in this game and with great explosions and gun play I have to say it's JUST a great experience. That's ALL!			"

												I've got this game in the summer sale, and yes, it's worth it.I Spend 5 EU on it, and every cent worth it.My best thing in this game is the details:When you shoot a brick wall, nothing happen, but if you shoot a wood wall, the bullet going through.You can destroy whole houses with your Grenade launcher,Bazooka,Grenade, etc.In Multiplayer there are 4 ""Classes"" The Assault, The Engineer,The Medic, and The Recon(Sniper).The Assault is a Simple Soldier, he has 1 Assault-Rifle,One Pistol, and the Grenade Launcher (Yet, you can unlock new weapons, and you can give this guy a Shotgun, if you like but i'm talking about the base gear).

												I rank this up there with COD4 as probably my favorite modern shooter. The buildings are destructible and can collapse and kill players. The maps are laid out perfectly for the game modes. Attack points are all in just the right place.The class system is simple, yet robust. Nothing like newer Battlefields, with their litany of weapons and attachments. No killstreaks or OP weapons. Everyone feels on relatively equal ground, with their gun being their most useful means of attack. If you enjoy FPS for GUNPLAY, then this game is for you.Older game, so it's cheap, but there are still plenty of servers. Can't recommend it enough.			"

It has gorgeous visual effects, voice acting and textures....at least for all graphic settings set to low ;D       I really enjoyed campaign and reccoment everyone try it.

												Unbalanced and inconsistent. To start off, I'm not great at shooters but I enjoy them for the competiton. This game though, the multiplayer makes me upset. Most servers advertise ""No spawn camping"" and ""Don't use X weapon if team size less than Y"". Sure it may sound good but when you spend a total of 3.5 seconds alive and the remainder waiting to respawn, you tend to get salty. Another thing that I don't like, but I understand why it's in place, is limits of how many of each class be in a match. It makes it really unfair when the defenders can camp buildings all as snipers but attackers aren't allowed to have any snipers at all! It feels like everyones weapon is stronger than yours when it takes a clip an a half of consistent hits to kill them but they just need 2. The cover system is aesthetic considering most covers can be shot through and the ones that can't can either be destroyed or are too short to actually serve as cover. The only populated servers are repatative. You gain better equipment as you rank up, so higher ranking players will be more accurate, deal and take more damage and have, overall, a better chance at being sucessful.Overall, this game can be fun, provided you get into a good server and the other players are a somewhat similar rank to you and you learn every nook of each map. If you like shooters for campers and dying, you'll like this. If you like shooters for gameplay that's based mostly on skill, maybe not so much.			"

												With fully destructible environments and a great multiplayer setup. This game ranks higher than all the other Battlefields to date. IMO it's better than BF3, not sure about 4 though, haven't played that one yet.The multiplayer can be fast paced, or slower depending on the size of the map and the server you are playing on. Some have a quicker respawn time than others. One thing I really like is the Hardcore mode that several servers use. Sure you die quicker and all but it's so much more realistic and keeps you on your toes.10 outta 10 from me!			"

												Whenever I'm playing a multiplayer match in Bad Company 2, I feel like I'm part of a large scale battle, not some small skirmish like most online shooters. The maps are huge and make for great battles. I don't really get upset about my K/D either, because Im really only focusing on taking points or completing objectives for the team. The destruction physics are beautiful and work well for strategy too, for example, sniper in tower pinning your squad down? Easy fix, just blow up the tower. Bad Company 2 is easily the best battlefield game ever made.			"

												The multiplayer is such a comprehensive FPS. The game play is of very high quality FPS grade. There are many guns with varied uses that actually feel like they each have their own feel to them. The class system and the perks are balanced so well that you really can equally enjoy everyone of them. The maps are spectacular vistas to behold. They are massive and extensive, but at the same time it is bearable to get around. The graphics are simply gorgeous and you need to make sure you have an adequate graphics card to run it. In comparison to the competing FPS games out there, such as COD Black Ops, it just completely blows them out of the water because of its depth, visual glory, and cohesive mesh of vehicular, FPS, and teamwork elements that COD could never accentuate. I highly recommend this game!			"

												I never really enjoyed online shooters or understood their appeal until I played this. Very hard to get into due to unlocks and classes being terrible for the first few levels, but once you get into the groove it's beyond immersive. Do not play if you have large numbers of real-life responsiblities to attend to.Be sure to turn up your FOV to 75 (that's vertical FOV; it equates to a 90 horizontal) in your .ini and you're good to go.

												Oh man where to start? To paraphrase; I love this game :3 . I played it back on my ps3 and thought about it all the time. So I thought, why not get it on pc? To move on, I now have a love/hate relationship with this game. Since this game is old (don't get me wrong it's still the best battlefield) only the vets play. So it is very challengeing to say the least. This game focuses on foot and armor combat. FPS. ummm yeah. I would only recomend getting this game now if you're willing to work hard and fight very experienced players. One issue that I have about the game is the hitbox. Sometimes  you might shoot a guy and the bullets don't hit for some reason, but that isn't toooooo bad. On the up side: it is challengeing and fun. Gravety affects your bullets and you can blow up what ever you want. Teamwork is key, and stop reading my comment and buy the game already :3    (srry for the bad spelling)If you dont wanna read that whole thing, then here is the moral of the story: Best, but challengeing, fps :3			"

												For me, this game was one of the most exciting and most enjoyable games in my gaming history. Although I have not played the multiplayer online yet due to nobody playing it anymore, the storyline was the most fun and gripping of which I have ever experienced.What made my experience good?For a starter the characters were thought out very well and were reallistic and had a proper personality behind them.Secondly the storyline had a sense of unknowing behind it, unlike other games similar; this one used a well made sound to create a sense of fear un unknowing in the player. This works well as a large group of players would likely be able to guess what what would happen due to real millitary knowlage, but adding the 'scalar' weapons into the game had a great effect as the player does not know what it is.At the start of the game the story line was very gripping and pulled the player into the action into something which was classified and turned it into a good plot for the story.The only negative point I would give is the animation specifically for events and vehicles is a little jittery and buggy.Overyally I rate this game a 9/10 and a general 'you must play this' kind of game.

												A realistic shooter with high quality graphics and game play. The single player story line is okay but only lasts about 6 too 8 hours the first time through. Multiplayer is where this game really shines with huge battles consisting of over 30 players you can blow the crap out of each other in four different game modes on a slurry of maps. Hardly anyone uses a mic so don't expect much co-operation from your team-mates though unless you're part of a clan or guild. I've logged far more hours on this game then any other and paid the full price of 60 dollars when it came out, completely worth it. Since then I've bought five additional copies ranging in price from 6.80 to 60.00 dollars for friends and family. It now retails for about 20.00 dollars and is completely worth it. Battlefield 3 will be coming out soon though so keep that in mind (if it's not already that is).			"

												This is one of the best battlefields you can play next to BF2 and 2142. The campaign is pretty good and the multiplayer is amazing. Multiplayer is pretty well balanced and plays out smoothly. Lots of people still play with dozens if not more full servers all day and everyday. The game runs pretty decent even on a crap PC, and the ping is alright on the majority of servers. I recommend playing this with a friend(s) on MP so it's 10x better. The MP has tons of stuff like attack (and transport) helis, tanks, cars, jetskis, ATV's you name it, it's there. Game also lacks hackers even for it being 4 years old, rarely see hackers ever. For 20 dollars this game is definitely worth it, and buying it will certainly bring in a lot of fun.			"

However they are not even the glimer of the pyre that this game is,this game is the best in the series ""next to battlefield 1942-and Battle field 2 and its expansions"" The gun fights are incredible and the battles are never boring and sharp shooters will always be happy with this game.

												I really love class-based multiplayer games (like Team Fortress 2 -- actually going all the way back to the Team Fortress mod for quakeworld), so Bad Company 2 really hits that perfect spot for me when it comes to first-person shooter style games.  The graphics are beautiful, and the realism is pretty amazing.  This is definitely one of, if not the only, game that I might keep a copy of Windows around to play since Valve ported all the Source engine-based games to Linux.  This any maybe Battlefield 4, if I ever decide to buy it.That said, it throws in a touch of RPG, forcing you to play hours and hours of gameplay to ""level up"" your soldier so you can be competitive in both single-player AND multiplayer games.  If I hadn't pre-ordered it and had it the day it came out, I could have seen myself getting angry about not having the same weapons available to other players, and it did cause me to only ever play Recon class (sniper, basically) because I never had a chance to level any other class up while trying to keep up as the class I really enjoyed best.In the end, though, I had a lot of fun playing.

												Back in it's hayday on xbox 360, this was the top competitor with Call of Duty. This game, however, required much more team work and involved much more realism with destructable environments and bullet drop physics. The campaign felt ropey taking 4 unprofessional rednecks through unlikely missions but the online was huge . . . before battlefield 3 and 4.Sadly since then, Battlfield 3 and now 4 is where the action is at (which you'll have to play through origin). Although, saying that, Battlefield 3 & 4 has kept the same great online formula but improved it in pretty much every way.Just steer clear of Battlfield Hardline. You'll be glad you did			"

												Bad Company 2 was my first game of the Battlefield series. I used to play it a lot on the PS3.Battlefield 3 was one of the reasons why I bought a gaming PC, which turned to be my new main platform, After over 200 hours in both Battlefield 3 and 4 I decided to pick up Bad Company 2 on Steam, because it was on sale.Now I remember why I stopped playing Battlefield 4 so suddenly - The series had it's peak with the Bad Company games.Bad Company 2 is currently the best version of Battlefield you can play on the PC. - No Origin - No Battlelog (Server List in Browser / starting your game via browser)- No prone (less campers)- Best Destruction in any Battlefield game- Most enjoyable weapons and vehicle balance in any Battlefield game- Bad Company games have a funny and entertaining campaign mode (much better than the 08/15 scripted ones in BF3 and BF4)- The hitboxes and ""time to kill"" feels more reasonable compared to newer Battlefield games- Still a beautiful game / you don't really see that this game is over 5 years old.And most important: This is the last game of the BF franchise that features a proper Rush mode!Yes BF3 and BF4 still have a Rush game mode, but it's very poorly done. Unbalanced and soul-less 1:1 conquest map slices.EA goes the ""wrong way"" (in the perspective of us gamers) with the Battlefield Series. The best way to voice your opinion is to buy Bad Company 2 and let EA know, that you would love the classic Battlefield experience back.Maybe they will listen some day, I doubt it...			"

												An incredible leap forward for the genre and multiplayer gaming. If you liked Battlefield 1942, you'll love this. If you didn't like Battlefield 1942, you still may love this. The new squad system, commander mode and lack of static health/ammo boxes are incredible incentives to promote teamplay. Players who want go off on their own in this game will not be nearly as successful as in other FPS games. I highly recommend it and I can't wait to see what the modding community can do to further enhance this title's value.			"

												No Origin Required. 10/10PROS.-Does not require use of the EA Origin game launcher-The last Battlefield where I can actually remember the characters from the story-Looks very good and runs very well on Frostbite game engine-Very fun and destructive multiplayer (Blowing things up, knocking down buildings, vehicle combat, etc.)-Smooth gunplay-Mod support-People in this game actually work together compared to more recent Battlefield titles-Well-written storyline, with the returning characters from the original Bad Company-Very intense unscripted multiplayer battles with some epic destruction mechanicsCONS.-Uses way too outdated (in my opinion) Punkbuster anticheat, which is also somewhat buggy sometimes and can get you randomly kicked from multiplayer games for no reason. VAC would be much nicer.-When playing it for the first time, expect some FPS drops for some reason, as this happens to many people when first launching the game-Missing some essential elements from video/interface settings (such as FOV slider, HUD customization, etc.)			"

												Played BC:1 back in the day and have always missed the simplicity and fun factor, especially after playing BF3/BF4. I never played BC:2 until now and wasn't sure how it would compare. About 2 minutes into my first game, equipped with the basic M24, I sniped the gunner out of the chopper that was lighting up our team. This is almost an impossible shot when playing BF3/4, in BC:2 it's not quite as 'sim' like and makes it that much more fun. After that I was hooked.BC:2, as many will tell you, is the last great Battlefield for so many reasons. No more grinding for (or buying $$) the best guns! This game is all about skill, and if you are reasonably experienced with FPS games you will play competitively from level 1.This game is so much more balanced than BF3/BF4, and best of all NO Origin! The only DLC you can buy (other than the camo pack) is Vietnam, which I picked up because of the great reviews, but I'd skip it. It's online only and the servers are empty. The main game however has dozens of full servers as of 11/30/14. For $5 this is an easy purchase.			"

												Bad Company 2 was my first game of the Battlefield series. I used to play it a lot on the PS3.Battlefield 3 was one of the reasons why I bought a gaming PC, which turned to be my new main platform, After over 200 hours in both Battlefield 3 and 4 I decided to pick up Bad Company 2 on Steam, because it was on sale.Now I remember why I stopped playing Battlefield 4 so suddenly - The series had it's peak with the Bad Company games.Bad Company 2 is currently the best version of Battlefield you can play on the PC. - No Origin - No Battlelog (Server List in Browser / starting your game via browser)- No prone (less campers)- Best Destruction in any Battlefield game- Most enjoyable weapons and vehicle balance in any Battlefield game- Bad Company games have a funny and entertaining campaign mode (much better than the 08/15 scripted ones in BF3 and BF4)- The hitboxes and ""time to kill"" feels more reasonable compared to newer Battlefield games- Still a beautiful game / you don't really see that this game is over 5 years old.And most important: This is the last game of the BF franchise that features a proper Rush mode!Yes BF3 and BF4 still have a Rush game mode, but it's very poorly done. Unbalanced and soul-less 1:1 conquest map slices.EA goes the ""wrong way"" (in the perspective of us gamers) with the Battlefield Series. The best way to voice your opinion is to buy Bad Company 2 and let EA know, that you would love the classic Battlefield experience back.Maybe they will listen some day, I doubt it...			"

												loved this game when it first came out and recently bought it for my pc. love the fact that you can flatten buildings and completely change the face of your battlefield. my only gripe is that for me the campaign isn't long enough just as you seemed to be getting in to it they finish it. personally i would have liked a longer campaign but overall it's a cracking game and i would definately recomend it			"

												I never liked the Battlefield series but this one is very fun. It's an older game but give they you more features than the newer Battlefield games don't have. Being able to blow up buildings until nothing is left is a great experiance. I don't care too much for modern shooters but this one is actually quiet decent. It has multiple game modes that are all very fun and balanced classes. This game does have a handful of guns which you earn through different classes that unlock through points. They have a Vietnam DLC that I highly recommend buying it's very fun and vintage feeling. There aren't so many maps or guns but the DLC is very fun if your into the whole WW2 aspect. As for servers the modern side has hundreds of servers and most of them are full. On the other hand the WW2 is a different story there are dozens of servers but only two or three are being used. There are High-XP servers you can join if your looking to speed through the game otherwise most are normal.			"

												One of the most epic shooters ever. Great feeling, sounds and effects, nice gameplay and teamplay, nice unlock system und good maps. Also very nice is the destruction of the map (buildings can collapse while you fight in them, bridges can be destroyed and if you hide behind a wall it could be that the wall will be away in a few seconds. This leads to an always a bit new gameplay on every map) Sadly it is missing some aspects I really loved bout BF2 but it looks like Battlefield 3 will combine the best of BFBC2 and BF2.			"

												Played BC:1 back in the day and have always missed the simplicity and fun factor, especially after playing BF3/BF4. I never played BC:2 until now and wasn't sure how it would compare. About 2 minutes into my first game, equipped with the basic M24, I sniped the gunner out of the chopper that was lighting up our team. This is almost an impossible shot when playing BF3/4, in BC:2 it's not quite as 'sim' like and makes it that much more fun. After that I was hooked.BC:2, as many will tell you, is the last great Battlefield for so many reasons. No more grinding for (or buying $$) the best guns! This game is all about skill, and if you are reasonably experienced with FPS games you will play competitively from level 1.This game is so much more balanced than BF3/BF4, and best of all NO Origin! The only DLC you can buy (other than the camo pack) is Vietnam, which I picked up because of the great reviews, but I'd skip it. It's online only and the servers are empty. The main game however has dozens of full servers as of 11/30/14. For $5 this is an easy purchase.			"

												This remains, along with BF 2142 (yes, you're reading that correctly), my favorite go-to FPS of all time. > Destructible environments make for an ever-evolving battlefield> Extremely well-executed, realistic, situationally appropriate voiceover work makes for an immersive, gratifying experience:""YEAH! I got that motherf**er!"" ""You're all patched up, now get back in the fight!"" ""(Bunch of Russian sh!t I can't understand)""> The biomechanics/movement feel smooth. > Vehicle learning curve (minus flying) isn't steep. > For those n00bies complaining about spawning and dying from seemingly nowhere...two words ""SQUAD UP!"". This isn't a CoD skill-less meat grinder...if you don't coordinate with a squad to blow MCOMs or cap flags, you'll be contributing to the betterment of an enemy squad's collective K/DR as *they* defend a point together, waiting for a stray OMA n00b to feast upon. > Contrary to some recent reviews (it's 6-28-14 now) there are still plenty of folks playing this who are disillusioned with BF3/BF4, like myself. > Frag on, bros!

												Simply put, the best multiplayer fps experience I've ever had. It was pure fun all along for the 300 hours or more I put into this game. Contrary to a lot of other fps, or any other battlefield game for the matter, I never really felt frustrated playing bad company 2. It was always fun, fast paced and never felt linear. You can see players from across the map if you look carefully and that's something I liked about this game. The maps were nice, not too tight, not too big and all around really well balanced. There was always a lot of action going on too. The squad death match mode was the only squad death match mode in a battlefield game that I ever felt was balanced and fun. I played other battlefield games before that and Battlefield 3 and 4, both for more than 300 hours, and I can tell you BC2 Fun Factor was off the charts compared to those other titles.Hope DICE comes out with another gem like this in a near future.

												In BFBC2, you can destroy most of the buildings. If some enemies are inside a building and shoot at you through a window, just take down the wall and fire back. In BF3/4, there are a lot of invincible walls so you cannot do that often.The thing I missed most in BFBC2 is the limited choices of gadgets. This forced people to do what their classes are designed to do. BF3 is ok for this part, but BF4 is another story.			"

												Sunk more time into this game than any other in my steam library. Multiplayer is AWESOME fun, and destructoring buildings goes a long way to making up for the flaws, such as prone, lack of 64 player maps and other features present in prior Battlefield games as well as a poorly implimented stats and server system. Will likely fall by the wayside with Battlefield 3 arriving but has been my most played game in the mean time.			"

												Rediscovering this awesome game 2 years later. Hell, i feel like i arrived a little late to the party, everyone's already drunk having a blast while i'm searching for glass to pour the booze.It's crazy to think what i been missing a along. My experience with the first installment of Bad Company on PS3 was terrible and i thought this was going to be the same thing so i avoided it all the time.This game is one of the most entertaining and realistic FPS games i have played in long time.Visually stunning, the gun sounds, explosions, etc are tremendous. The maps are pretty big and nicely done. Buy it now soldier. Yep, this is coming from a CoD Hammer Legion Member (Fanboy). ^^I'm seriously looking forward to BF3.My final veredict: 9.5/10. "

												Unbalanced and inconsistent. To start off, I'm not great at shooters but I enjoy them for the competiton. This game though, the multiplayer makes me upset. Most servers advertise ""No spawn camping"" and ""Don't use X weapon if team size less than Y"". Sure it may sound good but when you spend a total of 3.5 seconds alive and the remainder waiting to respawn, you tend to get salty. Another thing that I don't like, but I understand why it's in place, is limits of how many of each class be in a match. It makes it really unfair when the defenders can camp buildings all as snipers but attackers aren't allowed to have any snipers at all! It feels like everyones weapon is stronger than yours when it takes a clip an a half of consistent hits to kill them but they just need 2. The cover system is aesthetic considering most covers can be shot through and the ones that can't can either be destroyed or are too short to actually serve as cover. The only populated servers are repatative. You gain better equipment as you rank up, so higher ranking players will be more accurate, deal and take more damage and have, overall, a better chance at being sucessful.Overall, this game can be fun, provided you get into a good server and the other players are a somewhat similar rank to you and you learn every nook of each map. If you like shooters for campers and dying, you'll like this. If you like shooters for gameplay that's based mostly on skill, maybe not so much.			"

												With fully destructible environments and a great multiplayer setup. This game ranks higher than all the other Battlefields to date. IMO it's better than BF3, not sure about 4 though, haven't played that one yet.The multiplayer can be fast paced, or slower depending on the size of the map and the server you are playing on. Some have a quicker respawn time than others. One thing I really like is the Hardcore mode that several servers use. Sure you die quicker and all but it's so much more realistic and keeps you on your toes.10 outta 10 from me!			"

												Whenever I'm playing a multiplayer match in Bad Company 2, I feel like I'm part of a large scale battle, not some small skirmish like most online shooters. The maps are huge and make for great battles. I don't really get upset about my K/D either, because Im really only focusing on taking points or completing objectives for the team. The destruction physics are beautiful and work well for strategy too, for example, sniper in tower pinning your squad down? Easy fix, just blow up the tower. Bad Company 2 is easily the best battlefield game ever made.			"

												The multiplayer is such a comprehensive FPS. The game play is of very high quality FPS grade. There are many guns with varied uses that actually feel like they each have their own feel to them. The class system and the perks are balanced so well that you really can equally enjoy everyone of them. The maps are spectacular vistas to behold. They are massive and extensive, but at the same time it is bearable to get around. The graphics are simply gorgeous and you need to make sure you have an adequate graphics card to run it. In comparison to the competing FPS games out there, such as COD Black Ops, it just completely blows them out of the water because of its depth, visual glory, and cohesive mesh of vehicular, FPS, and teamwork elements that COD could never accentuate. I highly recommend this game!			"

												This is Sparta!At least, a more modern version ;)Since this game, most of the other FPS games became boring. If you ever had to run out of cover in a snowy, perfectly modelled landscape alongside a wooden fence between buildings, getting under fire again, and see the wood planks from that fence crashing out of it in front and behind you while running past and at the same time hearing the bullets zipping by in full 5.1 sound... you will know what i mean.This is combat.And it has combat in the not-so-hugely-large levels as the mainstream battlefield series, no, it's more the 32 people meet in small places kind of action :)Watch your back. Suppress the enemy while your squad advances, Help your comrades as  the medic(tm). Lay antitank mines..But get that objective under control.If the annoying sniper pest (called wookie, you'll know what i mean) gets to much on you nerves, get a tank or rpg and blow the hell out of his hiding hole, take out the wall, see the bricks flying around, or even better: tear down the whole building to show 'em once and for all :DDisclaimer: Not for cs kiddies who expect their bullets to not follow the force of gravityPlay it as long the servers are up!Ps.: and if you want to roast some Vietcong, play the Vietnam missionpack too			"

Multiplayer is pretty well balanced and plays out smoothly. Lots of people still play with dozens if not more full servers all day and everyday. The game runs pretty decent even on a crap PC, and the ping is alright on the majority of servers. I recommend playing this with a friend(s) on MP so it's 10x better. The MP has tons of stuff like attack (and transport) helis, tanks, cars, jetskis, ATV's you name it, it's there. Game also lacks hackers even for it being 4 years old, rarely see hackers ever. For 20 dollars this game is definitely worth it, and buying it will certainly bring in a lot of fun.			"

I keep checking occasionally hoping for an active server with players however I have yet to find one. So if you are buying for online, forget it!			"

												Bad Company 2 devoured much of my time on the Playstation 3 when I was in high school. While that community has become extinct, I rejoice at the discovery of a pretty dedicated community here on Steam. I've been dying to play this game online again, and now I can say that my wish as been happily granted.*NOTE* - If you buy this game and end up on an empty Server Browser screen, don't freak out. It threw me off at first too, but the solution is to just change your Filter options and hit the Search button. Then games will start to appear. The game holds up pretty well. High Pings can ruin the smoothness of gameplay, bogging it down with torential lag, but those games are few and far between. My skill has definitely been enhanced by my introduction to Mouse/Keyboard.Great game, lots of destruction, lots of space to move around in. This game was amazing in 2010, and it's still amazing in 2015. I've only had it for a few hours, but I am already heading down the familiar path to lvl 50 Colonel.The only real shame is that Steam doesn't have Bad Company 1, which had some really ♥♥♥♥♥in maps.

												Very excellantly crafted game. The simplicity and small class oriented style makes for a fun multiplayer. The Campaign was awesome, and in my opinion does not need an explanation as to why. The sheer plot and style of execution speaks for itself. Going back to the multiplayer, if you look at games like Battlefield 3 & 4 the sheer amount of customization is new compared to Bad Company 2, but at the same time Bad Company 2 provides for a simipler but still fun [competitive] experience.

												This was, and still is, my favorite FPS of all time. They really nailed it on the maps, destruction and loads of guns. Growing up playing it on xbox 360, then recently on PC, it feels like it never lost its touch. The game still holds up graphically to modern games, but is a lot easier to run on a lower spec rig. From the intense firefights you'll have, to the dog fights in the air, and watching as building crumble on top of your foes, you can't get a better muliplayer experience IMO. I highly recommend Battlefield Bad Company 2.			"

												This is fantastic, after having done a bit of it...I can see why Bf Bc2 is the gold standard for many modern FPS.   It's well built, with balanced gameplay.  A decent unlock system.  There are still plenty of active servers (although only a couple in the DLC)  I have 2 complaints.  1) you can't go prone.  That's personal preference, and now that I'm used to it, I can get along without it.  But in my opinion that's something every tactical FPS should include.   2)There is one glitch that I've observed worth mentioning.  With the sighting system on the guns, whether it be iron sights or a scope, there is a glitch where you'll zoom in and it'll suddenly zoom you back out part of the way, you'll stay scoped...but to give an example- --  You'll be using a 4x scope, and suddenly be looking at it from 2x instead of 4x.  That can be quite annoying.The Graphics: 8/10  For something as old as this is, the graphics are quite fantistic.  Explosions look amazing, and they've done a fantastic job with destructable envoirnments, as well as smoke/dust/wind.Multiplayer: 10/10  This is very much a gold standard for multiplayer FPSCampaign:6/10  About average for a modern FPS.Ranking system: 10/10  They've done a good job with unlocks, it's not incredibly unbalanced for beginners, as they still get weapons worth using.Overall: 9/10  I'd very much recommend getting this, if only for the multiplayer experience.

												I rank this up there with COD4 as probably my favorite modern shooter. The buildings are destructible and can collapse and kill players. The maps are laid out perfectly for the game modes. Attack points are all in just the right place.The class system is simple, yet robust. Nothing like newer Battlefields, with their litany of weapons and attachments. No killstreaks or OP weapons. Everyone feels on relatively equal ground, with their gun being their most useful means of attack. If you enjoy FPS for GUNPLAY, then this game is for you.Older game, so it's cheap, but there are still plenty of servers. Can't recommend it enough.			"

												Bad Company 2 devoured much of my time on the Playstation 3 when I was in high school. While that community has become extinct, I rejoice at the discovery of a pretty dedicated community here on Steam. I've been dying to play this game online again, and now I can say that my wish as been happily granted.*NOTE* - If you buy this game and end up on an empty Server Browser screen, don't freak out. It threw me off at first too, but the solution is to just change your Filter options and hit the Search button. Then games will start to appear. The game holds up pretty well. High Pings can ruin the smoothness of gameplay, bogging it down with torential lag, but those games are few and far between. My skill has definitely been enhanced by my introduction to Mouse/Keyboard.Great game, lots of destruction, lots of space to move around in. This game was amazing in 2010, and it's still amazing in 2015. I've only had it for a few hours, but I am already heading down the familiar path to lvl 50 Colonel.The only real shame is that Steam doesn't have Bad Company 1, which had some really ♥♥♥♥♥in maps.

It has gorgeous visual effects, voice acting and textures....at least for all graphic settings set to low ;D       I really enjoyed campaign and reccoment everyone try it. I have tried online on diffrent pc and to be honest- really hard to get an single kill :D not like in campaign where you are the brave ""rush B!"" guy. :D         9/10       -1 because of bad optimisation for new systems (got big fps problems sadly)			"

												In BFBC2, you can destroy most of the buildings. If some enemies are inside a building and shoot at you through a window, just take down the wall and fire back. In BF3/4, there are a lot of invincible walls so you cannot do that often.The thing I missed most in BFBC2 is the limited choices of gadgets. This forced people to do what their classes are designed to do. BF3 is ok for this part, but BF4 is another story.			"

I would love to see more people pick this up because it still a great game- as good or better than the newer Battlefield titles (definitely trounces BF1 and SW BF).

												Unload half an LMG clip into someone, and you'll be killed with a single shotgun shell from 30 meters away.Run into a field, and you'll get shot by a sniper.Spawn, blown up by an Apache.Spawn again, sniped by someone behind your base.Join the wrong team, and they'll all be snipers and hide in the bushes while the other team caps everything with ease.Try sniping on the attacking team, hide in a bush, get sniped from across the map by someone spamming Q until the red marker shows up above your head.Fly a helicopter, you'll get blown up with rockets before you even leave the ground.Drive a tank, and you'll get C4'd within the minute.Ride in the passenger of a tank, and your driver will drive over a mine.Blow someone to smithereens with an RPG, and their friend will defibrilate them before shooting you down.Run into cover while being shot at, only to have the lag catch up and kill you while you're in a safe spot.60+fps at all times, but never have a ping below 250.And that's just on a good day. A regular day, in Battlefield. If you can look past all that and play with a large group of close friends that won't trash talk you after killing you with a tank, then it's a very enjoyable multiplayer game.			"

												The campaign is really good but doesn't take that long to complete. I completed it on normal and some missions hard. However, the multiplayer is strange. I can't find any running servers. Buy this game on sale, not at full price.			"

												This game is still in my Top 3 BF series games. Battlefield 1942 > BF2 > Battlefield Bad Company 2.It's well made, easy to learn interface. The single player is fun as hell, The multiplayer is Fantastic. This is one of those games where it should be allowed to have a Community Map builder option so people can invest the time in it. There are lots of folks still playing it to this day. They don't even need to make a New BFBC3 they could just release a mappack with like 4-10 new maps in it and maybe a CTF mode and people would buy it, i know i would. So yeah if you want to be stressed out, yet have some fun times with friends then get this game.1,593.7 hrs on record <----You don't get that from playing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.			"

												Even after playing hundred of hours on this game on the Xbox 360, this game still doesn't dissapoint on the PC. Sure, there may be be less players on the servers than on the more recent titles such as Battlefield 4, but this game delivers a unique charm that might never be able to be recreated again in multiplayer history... Unless Bad Company 3 happens. DICE, make it happen!11/10 Would play again. Forever.			"

												Unload half an LMG clip into someone, and you'll be killed with a single shotgun shell from 30 meters away.Run into a field, and you'll get shot by a sniper.Spawn, blown up by an Apache.Spawn again, sniped by someone behind your base.Join the wrong team, and they'll all be snipers and hide in the bushes while the other team caps everything with ease.Try sniping on the attacking team, hide in a bush, get sniped from across the map by someone spamming Q until the red marker shows up above your head.Fly a helicopter, you'll get blown up with rockets before you even leave the ground.Drive a tank, and you'll get C4'd within the minute.Ride in the passenger of a tank, and your driver will drive over a mine.Blow someone to smithereens with an RPG, and their friend will defibrilate them before shooting you down.Run into cover while being shot at, only to have the lag catch up and kill you while you're in a safe spot.60+fps at all times, but never have a ping below 250.And that's just on a good day. A regular day, in Battlefield. If you can look past all that and play with a large group of close friends that won't trash talk you after killing you with a tank, then it's a very enjoyable multiplayer game.			"

												Played this game significantly on 360 and couldn't help but pick it up when I saw it on sale for £3.74.  Using the server browser I had no trouble getting into a game (there aren't a million people playing but in the couple of hours I have played so far there have been at least 10 servers up with good player counts).  I would love to see more people pick this up because it still a great game- as good or better than the newer Battlefield titles (definitely trounces BF1 and SW BF).  If you're worried about finding a game, as of right now I can say you won't have any issue and the gameplay is still awesome.			"

												This is a awesome game which incorporates team values and teamwork into the gameplay. If you don't have a good team and they don't know how to back each other up then don't plan on winning alot of games. Its a great game with awesome special effects. The downfall to the game is that it has a swearing problem and drops the F- Word alot. If that kind of stuff doesn't bother you, then you might find it kind of humorous to play with other American teammates in game. The achievements in game are fun to get and sometimes a real challenge. The secret to ranking up fast is getting stars for weapons. To get stars fast you can find a pistol only server or just play each weapon till you get a gold star for each. Its a great game and a hard game to put down when starting. If you are wondering weather or not to get this game then don't hesitate and just get it because its a really must have for any war loving First Person Shooter Fan!			"

												This is, in my honest opinion, the best of the Battlefield games. The maps are the perfect size. The gun play is very rewarding and statisfying. Vehicles aren't as prevalent as BF3 and BF4 (a con to some, a pro to me.) The player base on PC is still pretty decent. This is a great pickup for any FPS/Battlefield enthusiast. It has tons of time sink potential and is just plain fun. I had previously played a good amount on Xbox 360 around 2010-2012 and revisited it on the 360 last year. It still feels like a damn good game and has aged very well.			"

												Even after looking through the discussions and reading reviews I was still not sure whether this would be worth it, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥is it worth it.I can't believe how well this game has held up. I played it maybe ONCE way back in the day, but I wasn't too into shooters at that time. The first Battlefield I played was 3, and I didn't even get around to it until like two years after it's release.That's when I became a Battlefield man. Honestly in my opinion it's the best franchise in its genre and I poured countless hours into 3, 4, and Hardline, still haven't gotten to One yet, but I've heard great things.All that set aside I'm blown away by how fun this installment is, and lively. Cheaters are punished, matches are more often than not well balanced, and the community is enjoyable. Tons of maps, tight FPS gameplay, great atmosphere. Seriously you should pick this up, sale or not.			"

												I never played Battlefield before, but then i found this game on sale and i decided i will try it and it was good decision. I really started liking Battlefield because of this game and i spend many hours on BF4. BFBC2 is nice game and it's still played a lot. I found in this game only few little issues, like you have to create Origin account (if you don't have one already) and that some buttons are uneditable (for example Enter). But these things are absolutely nothing, this game is very nice and if you like FPS you should buy this without a doubt (on sale it's like stealing xD). I definitely recommend this game. Result: 9,5/10 (just for that it requires Origin registration, otherwise it would be 10/10)			"

												I was going to write a jokeful review because I ended up refunding this game, but I might as well give a real one because why not. In my opinion, the graphics in this game is on par with the newest titles in the series. The buildings look great, the trees and landscapes look amazing, and the water looks real. The gun flashes are perfect and the physics are perfect aside from a few execptions.Audio wise, and again in my opinion, this game is the best in the series and based on the ""progression"" shown by the devs in BF3 and BF4, this game may have the best audio for many titles to come. I don't really know how to describe why it's so great, it just sounds more realistic to me.As for how active the game is at this date, there were a few active servers, most of them having people in a que to get in. I didn't check for the core servers, but what I said is true for the hardcore servers. The reason I refunded this game is in this area. I researched this game a lot online before buying it, and it seemed like there weren't too many hackers in the game. Maybe I just had bad luck but I came across quite a few in the first hour of playing. I decided not to test my luck any further since the cut off for the refund is 2 hours of play time. I definetly reccommend this game to anyone who loves Battlefield, especially those who don't have the greatest computers, as it is not very strenuous to run this game. This is by far my favorite in the series, but I just dont want to have to deal with the hackers in this game when for the same price I can get BF4.			"

												Честно говоря, я ее бы не купил, так-как давно уже вышла BF3, да и скоро уже должна выйти BF4, но так-как мое железо оставляет желать лучшего, то мог довольствоваться BF2 Bad Company 2, но после нескольких часов я стал понимать, что она лучше чем BF3, конечно не графикой, но самое главное там нету BattleLog'а, что ОЧЕНЬ мешает жить, второе там  мало багов, игра очень нравится, хоть нету самолетов, поэтому ставлю игре 9/10			"

												Thi game should be called Battlefield: Bad, because that's what it is. This game sucks balls on the PC, gunplay is absolute wank and most of the servers are German. Teamplay is strongly discouraged and the majority of players spam ""#rekt"" in global after they kill you with their leet super sniping skills. This game is so bad it hurts because I loved it on the 360 and the original bad company. 2142 is still the best BF in my experience, this is just a horrible console port.			"

												Despite featuring the most solid multiplayer FPS gameplay on market, just about everything in it will fill you with hours of unbridled rage. Next time you shoot a guy in the face with a 12 gauge slug and have him shrug it off and take no damage, remember, it could be worse. You could be playing Modern Warfare or something.Do you like dying a lot? You better! Even with the same weapon as the enemy, you will always die first because absolutely everyone in the game uses the Magnum Ammo specialization that increases small arms damage by 125%. After playing the game for several hours and ranking up you will finally unlock the ability to participate in firefights on equal footing.At level the prestigious Rank 50, General of All of the Armies, EA/DICE gives you a complementary aimbot.

There are some problems with balancing; everyone seems to have their own opinion on which class is overpowered.

												Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is hands down the best Battlefield DICE has released. This was the introduction into the Battlefield series for me. Once I played this rendition of Battlefield, I was instantly hooked. BF3, and BF4 are both amazing shooters in their own right, don't get me wrong, however, in my opinion, DICE has yet to match the amazingness that is Bad Company 2. When the Vietnam DLC was realeased for BC2 the game became even more amazing than it already was. How that is even possible, I don't even know. My best memories of a shooter game will definitely involve BC2 Vietnam and the original version of BC2 as well. Vietnam was amazing because of the awesome setting of the DLC (Duh) but also because of the mood the DLC gave off, it seemed just all pure fun and didn't take itself too seriously. One example of that is the music playing when you launch the DLC some awesome classical rock music including, my favorite classical band Creedence Clearwater Revival. Overall I would definitely give this game a 10/10 for an awesome campaign, and just a pure fun multiplayer. I believe whenever DICE decides to make a sequel to BC2 they must do so with care. And remember, to not have the game take itself too seriously and of course, destuction, because what would a Battlfield game be without destruction? Oh, and bringing back Vietnam in the next rendition would be nice too, along with the awesome music! :P			"

The weapons feel powerful, the gameplay is fast-paced and exhilarating, and the maps are some of my personal favourites from the series. For a game this old, with three sequels, it has a surprisingly active, thriving community, (I just wish more people would play the Vietnam DLC, it's excellent, but sadly there are never many servers).Highly recommend this game to anyone, especially for those who have played BF3 / Hardline / BF4 and are looking for something new to play while you wait for BF1, you'll be surprised.

												Battlefield : Bad Company 2 might be the only current-gen/next-gen Battlefield game to not be stained by EA greediness. Just wait before the franchise turns into a free-to-play game with microtransactions and before it invades the Android platform.The community is still active even nowadays. And yet the game is still the most overlooked Battlefield of the franchise. "

												I enjoyed this game a lot. There are 2 major down sides to this game and the rest is basically great. The biggest issue for me would be the lack of online players. It has been 5 years since the game has launched so the loss of the community is no suprize, but it's still a con. Another one would be it's optimization. From what I have noticed is my game gets a constant 10fps on minimum graphics with a GTX 750ti, now this is the first 20 minutes after starting the game up. After this point the game gets 60fps fine on max graphics. I don't know why this happens, but it does. Of course now for the pros right. Well I find it hard to specify specific parts of the game that make it as good as it is. The driving and shooting fell good with little to no aim assist. The campaign is pretty well put together and has some weird glitches starting and finishing a cutscene, but nothing gamebreaking. The actual campaing has 2 main areas a snow desert and a jungle which both look very well for 2010. The Jungle reminds me of Halo 3 the mission sierra 117 persoanlly. The button layout isn't ideal at start, but you can configure that so who cares. I do reccomend playing with atleast 1 friend because then you can play on a serrver alone with your friend/friends. This can be a lot of fun and will allow you to do fun glitches or just d**king around. I reccomend this game if you enjoy the battlefield series, have a group of friends that will play with you, and for nistolgia of course.			"

												For those who buy this if online servers look like their not there, on server settings uncheck all that apply leave the boxs blank then search agian and all severs should pop up for you. There does not seem to be any hackers this is a good thing because fair competition and fair gameplay is what matters in this world. The gameplay is beautiful like a art piece full of emotion as war is so brutal and full of tactics. For those who played ""black hawk down"" the game of the year in 2004, well battlefield is just like that just a greater and bigger version i really reccommend this battlefield bad company 2. BF bad company 2 is the only BF on steam so you have honestly nothing to lose by buying it you will have the only BF game that steam has to offer and it is one of the best BF games out there. Battlefield: Bad Company 2 also known as Bad Company 2, BFBC2 or BC2 is the tenth installment in the Battlefield Series and was developed by DICE and published by Electronic Arts. It is the sequel to Battlefield: Bad Company and was praised by critics, many of which commended DICE's work on the destructible environments, and its robust multiplayer component.			"

												Battlefield: Bad Company 2 marks the high point of Battlefield games. The only DLC available for this game added maps, weapons, character models, everything that you could hope for in a DLC. But, that does not necessarily make this game worth the money. The multiplayer is dissapointingly dead. You can still find a concurrent playerbase, but that does not make this game active, really. Is it worth the money? onsale, sure. Definitely.			"

												Occasionally I fall back on BFBC2 to play the great campaign. Here's my review. I don't write a lot, and there's not much chance this will reach the front, but to those who read this:  It's worth the 20$ (standalone price).   Battlefield Bad Company 2 is the sequel to the original. I have not played the original, but from the campaign and the witty characters, I can tell the company has a strong bond (at least in this game). Battlefield Bad Company 2 has a great storyline to it, and develops the story line very interesting. It also balances out storyline with gameplay - meaning that you won't have 30-minute-long story cuts (exaggerations), but instead be able to be part of the action. For instance - you're sneaking on an enemy and your team intends on going about the job in a sneaky way. You have only your trust combat knife, and there's 1 enemy at the watchtower you need to take out to get the job clean. The story doesn't do it for you; you have to creep up (crouch) and sneakily assassinate him. After that, the story may resume.  The story, again, is very detailed and nicely planned. It is not something someone made up within a day - it is something made up within weeks, or even months.  The only downside is that the campaign is really short. You can finish it within a couple hours, at most a day or two. Still, it's worth it.  Since this is 20$ and it is 7 year of age (up to this review), the game has not been updated, but has been kept alive. There are about 20 or so multiplayer servers hosted in a multitude of countries that keep the multiplayer section still running, for when you finish that really quick campaign.   The game's way of playing is unlike anything else. It's like a regular schooter, but you will see that within the multiplayer, and a little bit of singleplayer, you will have to use other things. For example, there are 4 classes; Assault, Medic, Recon, and Engineer ( ***please note that in the single player you can change up primariers and secondaries and you do not have classes***). The Assault is a basic class; usual primary with an auto/burstfire rifle and a pocket pistol. The Recon is a somewhat complex class; you have a motion sensor ball that when thrown will recieve radio signals. If you're on the US side, and you hear english, there are teammates nearby. If you're on the US side, and you hear russian, there are enemies by [and you need to start poppin' some ruskis, no hate to my russians] and vice-versa. The Recon also has about 5 C4's. You can lay down C4 and with a right-click, they detonate. C4's are highlighted with detailed circles on your mini-map and while visible. What's fun is that you can attach C4's onto your car (in MP) and drive them into enemy tanks or just enemy territory, get out, and set off the C4's, making funny kills. Recon comes with a sniper rifle and pistol. The Medic class usually comes with a defibrillator and you can resurrect teammates. I have seen this, but in old servers - it may be removed in newer ones. Medic has a PKM usually (or any LMG) and, of course, a pistol. The Engineer is my favorite class. Usually, this class comes with a silenced machine-pistol (or SMG), and a regular pistol. The Engineer, in MP, has a rocket launcher (usually just the russian RPG), which will prove to be very helpful when blowing up enemy tanks and/or jeeps / ATVs.  The engineer class also comes with a power-drill that can heal vehicles, any vehicle (probably don't want to do it on your enemy's vehicle though) and can also kill. Yes, you can kill with a power drill, and yes, it's very funny.   In the end, this game is really amazing, even after years of being on the Steam shop. Its campaign may be short, but Multiplayer will definitely suit your needs. Multiplayer is also the most fun, depending on how you are.  In short, for $20 and with an age of 5+ years (at the time of this review 7 years), Battlefield: Bad Company 2 serves as a great game overall regardless of its short campaign, which it makes up for again with the multiplayer. I sincerely recommend this game for nostalgia, battlefield playstyle, and fun times with an FPS game. Consider the $20 worth it.  "

The very best maps, The very best sound (just put it on ""WARTAPE"" setting), awesome solocampaign, the best MP, No lag,No complaining wimps (baaah 2 vs 1, im the boyfriend of your mom, hacker and what not)no ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC like op weapons, no ""buy maps"" Looking at you BF3, BF4, COD in general. Buy it once, have fun, no need to spend another 500 euros for crap that should've been in the game in the first place.still populated as other games'd wish they were ;)And best of all: NO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ KILLSTREAKmoronMOVES like ima killyall with ma superspaceatomicshitbirdplane ftfy it will last for 5minutes like in every single COD.

												this is the best game that has been published by EA so far. it gives a strong story with characters that you'll actually create a significant bond with, but enough with story blabber. gameplay wise the game gets as close as I've ever felt to being an actuall soldier. this game straight out takes a number two on BF4. in BF 3-4 you can destroy some houses or buildings, oh how scary. in bad company 2 you can completely destroy small villages, only leaving the metall frames of the bouldings as a reminder that HOLY ♥♥♥♥ YOU DESTROYED A 4 LEVEL BUILDING! THAT WAS SO PRO. I rate this a 9/10. it would be a 10/10 if not DX9 was default and you had to go file digging to change it to 10. and please do that. the graphics really can't be stopped in this one.			"

												I was going to write a jokeful review because I ended up refunding this game, but I might as well give a real one because why not. In my opinion, the graphics in this game is on par with the newest titles in the series. The buildings look great, the trees and landscapes look amazing, and the water looks real. The gun flashes are perfect and the physics are perfect aside from a few execptions.Audio wise, and again in my opinion, this game is the best in the series and based on the ""progression"" shown by the devs in BF3 and BF4, this game may have the best audio for many titles to come. I don't really know how to describe why it's so great, it just sounds more realistic to me.As for how active the game is at this date, there were a few active servers, most of them having people in a que to get in. I didn't check for the core servers, but what I said is true for the hardcore servers. The reason I refunded this game is in this area. I researched this game a lot online before buying it, and it seemed like there weren't too many hackers in the game. Maybe I just had bad luck but I came across quite a few in the first hour of playing. I decided not to test my luck any further since the cut off for the refund is 2 hours of play time. I definetly reccommend this game to anyone who loves Battlefield, especially those who don't have the greatest computers, as it is not very strenuous to run this game. This is by far my favorite in the series, but I just dont want to have to deal with the hackers in this game when for the same price I can get BF4.			"

												I did enjoy battlefield 3, but nothing will ever top this game. Battlefield: Bad Company 2 set a standard for me in 2010 that in five years has remained unmatched.     Fly copters, drive tanks and ATVs into battle, BLOW UP BUILDINGS, drop walls on people, get sniped in the mouth by people with skill.      I will never not love this game.[Note: gametime is of course steam version only, I started on PS3 and played on PC from a disc copy for quite some time.]			"

												Played this game significantly on 360 and couldn't help but pick it up when I saw it on sale for £3.74.  Using the server browser I had no trouble getting into a game (there aren't a million people playing but in the couple of hours I have played so far there have been at least 10 servers up with good player counts).  I would love to see more people pick this up because it still a great game- as good or better than the newer Battlefield titles (definitely trounces BF1 and SW BF).  If you're worried about finding a game, as of right now I can say you won't have any issue and the gameplay is still awesome.			"

												Even after playing hundred of hours on this game on the Xbox 360, this game still doesn't dissapoint on the PC. Sure, there may be be less players on the servers than on the more recent titles such as Battlefield 4, but this game delivers a unique charm that might never be able to be recreated again in multiplayer history... Unless Bad Company 3 happens. DICE, make it happen!11/10 Would play again. Forever.			"

People even play Vietnam DLC :)Important thing though, when You try to find a game go to browse servers and press ""search"". Otherwise server list is going to be empty.Game is still great and fresh, well balanced. Just like the old times. Haven't had any problems with hackers or cheats...I recommend! Bomb/10.			"

												This game is an old classic. For me, better than new Battlefields (1, 4, 3, Hardline). I don't know why but it is just perfectGraphics+ Very good detail, textures, terrain for year 2010Gameplay+ Didn't see any glitches or anything like that, no bugs.- Sometimes you will have to shoot your whole clip/magazine to a player to kill him. Pretty badCampaign+ Very good campaign, great and funny story. + I didn't have any problems with any missions. In this game there is no ""stuck"" mission. (If you know what i mean by that)Multiplayer+ Very good multiplayer, pretty hard to level up when you are new to the game but thats okay.- This may not be bad for everyone, but maybe for some of you is. You have servers which players create, not developers so there are a couple of modded servers. Look out for that because it will totally destroy your experience and you will lose a lot of fun. My friend did it and he stopped playing it after a couple of hours because he had everything.MP Guns+ A lot of guns for all classes+- This isn't bad it doesn't change gameplay that's why i put +-. There are only two scopes in the game. Reflex/red dot and 4x Acog scope. MP Vehicles+ A lot of vehicles to choose from quad bikes to helicopters. Altough I don't know if there are jets because I didn't play conquest only rush because that's my favourite game mode. :/Maps+ A lot of maps without same enviromentOverall I would rate this game10/10Very good game, my favourite Battlefield I fully recommend this game "

												Performance 9/10:Very solid game.                                Runs smooth as silk                                Servers are only down now and them, usually for maintenance  Playability: 9/10:   Not much rubber-banding,                                Rarely lags                                Servers are pretty smooth                                Battlelog/loadout etc... is all done from inside the game window, no need for browser launcher!Cost: 10/10:           Easily worth the full cost                               In a sale it's an absolute steal                               Vietnam is an interesting addon, Like a second game with different weapons etc...Overall 10/10:         Still quite active community, online players doesn't usually drop below 450-500 players online.                                 I've met some nice gamers on the servers, a nice (smaller) community.                                 It get's a 10/10 from me because of the loadout/battlelog window is built into the main game.    On later BF games a web browser needs to be launched and Origin launched in order to play.                                It's also a gift that steam can be used to screenshot the game scenes... this is all why it gets a 10/10!			"

												As a firearms entusias, I am very critical of videogames misrepresenting guns. It does very well to properly represent combat (relative to other videogames) and is a lot of fun. I definatley reccomend the Vietnam expansion. The only problem can be the graphics, however they are still passable as a modern game, and not important.			"

												I truly belive this game can give you PTSD, no joke.Why? Ill explainStory: I honestly dont give a ♥♥♥♥, but, i enjoy it because while it does follow your FPS stereotypes of (insert country/terrorist) are invading america and its up to you and (insert a cast of burly americans and one minorty because were not racist) to stop. Yet the game is light hearted and self aware threw out and if it was an action movie it would be alright.Gameplay: The story missions are somewhat linear and some of the things the game expects you to do is bull♥♥♥♥♥♥ But there alright. YET, the multiplayer is where it shines. Your given a large map with tons of vehicles and buildings and you shoot it up. And all the classes have a use, with large maps snipers can pick off pepole in enemy bases one by one without the other team noticeing. The assault is the one that goes in at close range to take enemys on. Engineres(my favorite) can both repair and destroy vehicles, which is extremly usefull on bigger maps. And medics can deal damage and heal teamates. Plus you can be put in a squad to take on enemys all at once. Also theres bullet drop, which i honestly dont like on most classes but it makes snipeing satisfying.But the one selling point of the game is how all the buildings are destroyable. You are not safe ever in this game... EVER. You die quickly and there are tanks, RPGS, helecpoters, everything that can blow you up. And if your house takes a bad enough beatings it completly colapses killing you. This makes the game super tense AND I LOVE IT!Presntation: Notice how i didnt put GRAPHICS. Because while the game looks good, ive still seen better. But where the game truly makes belive you can get PTSD is the sound desighn. This game has the best sound desighn in any game ive ever played. When a bomb blows up next to you, its LOUD, and makes your characters ears ring or muffles the noises. You can hear bullets miles away or when they just miss your head. Ive honsetly jumped from the sound of a snipers bullet wizzing by my head. And when a building is about to collapes, you hear the sound of metal bending, then the entire house falling and its scary. There is rarley a quiet moment in this game and it is stressfull. AND I LOVE IT!Get this game. Its great.			"

												This game is awesome, one of my fps favourite games and my favourite Battlefield.To start im gonna give 10/10 of the game itself, the singleplayer has a decent story about USA vs Russia, you play with a personage called Wyatt (in the beginning) and later you will play with a personage called Preston Marlowe a squadron of 3 sodiers (including you) and a commander, basicly you only control Marlowe the others helps you untill you finish the game your objective on Campaign (Warning spoiler here)  is to destroy Russia's Superweapon. Now about multiplayer... THE SERVERS STILL HOT, there are a lot of people in this game playing multiplayer, the maps are awesome, and basicly the multiplayer is awesome, in multiplayer there are four roles (Assault, Engineer, Medic and Recon) that you can choose one untill you die.Btw to star a Multiplayer game just click Search button, its not a bug its just a tiny error or not that developers would fix that.I give 10/10 of this game;9/10 of campaign;and 9.9/10 of multiplayer.

												NOTE: I played so much more of this game before I found it on Steam.What a wondrous creation. Where to begin? I think this game became so much more than it meant to be, which is great, but alas time goes on, and so many people have moved on to bigger and badder titles. However, just to be clear, as of my writing, this game -->STILL HAS A MULTIPLAYER PRESENCE<-- In fact, it was a bit bigger than I expected, with multiple servers still available to play on. Vietnam is a bit worse off though...Anyways, moving along to the good stuff.Bad Co. 2 had a pretty nice engine and look. Frostbite 2 was great, and the destructibility of environment items was amazing at the time, it felt rather new and exciting. The attention to detail was fantastic as well, the scenes typically felt as if they were alive instead of some dull backdrop to your gunplay. The maps, both in SP and MP, looked rather stunning. In multiplayer, the levolution was creative, and often times very exciting to experience.Oh, gunplay! Did it feel joyous? Well there were some flaws, as per usual, but BC2 certainly made up for those. It was nice, at least. There were (and still are) several occasions upon which I would 'trade' lives with an opponent. That's alright though. Weapons at least fire bullets. It was a ton of fun to have to deal with bullet drop, and watch people play terribly because they came from a hitscan game. There was a nice selection of weapons to choose from in each class, and several weapons that were usable in all kits! Classes felt great in multiplayer if you ask me. Giving LMGs and medic items to a support class felt ingenious, whilst having engineers stealth via suppressed weapons and blow things up, assault characters drop ammo kits and provide grenade launcher support (with different types of rounds), and recon players call in mortar strikes, throw radar mines, and... snipe. It felt a little more balanced and well rounded, albeit the fact that the occasional wall of recon players seemed indestructible.Single player had it's side of followers as well, and for good reason. The story seemed well cared for, and it was structured well. There was enough variety in the levels and combat experience in each mission, that I didn't feel like I was playing one never-ending unchanging campaign. I also got really attached to the characters, as I'm sure many people did. Each personality was fleshed out, detailed, and lovable. It was all of the squad members put together, with a kickass story, and a variety of gameplay options that made this the game we still love 6 years laterThis is all I've got on this one for now, I've left out a ton that others loved about the game, but add to it! You know what you loved about BC2!Check out the beefier review: http://wp.me/p73yYy-4c "

It's totally worth to buy, of course buy with DLC.  I paid 6 euro for Game and awesome DLC.			"

												Awesome game. Very fun and multiplayer is very much alive after so many years. It is an old game and a cheap one. Gameplay is very good and graphics are nice also. I strongly recommend this game to everyone. For those who cant find a multiplayer game: Start the game, click Multiplayer and then choose Server Browser, log in to your EA account and create a soldier then choose him. Now on ALL SERVERS tab in the right choose a game mode (I usually play on CONQUEST it is more fun than others) or leave it at All game modes and click search. DO NOT narrow the search down anymore leave it at all maps and at all regions for a start and dont tick any boxes also. then a list of servers will appear. Now at this list click twice on a tab called PLAYERS this will filter the list by the number of players playing on servers. Choose a server and have fun. There are hardcore servers too and you probably dont want to play there in the beginning, but later on they are very fun also. There is always a good amount of players online (24/7). Be aware that some servers have in descriptions a higher exp amount where you will level up your soldiers rank and equipment very fast. If you like easy life you can play there, but I prefer to work my way up myself and play on low exp servers and learn every new weapon as I play. It is also much more rewarding like that. From server list you can also put servers to favorite list so you dont have to search every time for a fun server. There is less players in Vietnam DLC which is a shame, but the main game will offer a lot of fun in multiplayer at any point of a day. Campagin is very interesting too. Good story. And if you buy the game you wont have to purchase anything in the game itself. It is probably because there isnt anyhing to purchase :)			"

												This game is about a man on a mission. He lost his job with the Phone company  and couldn't get one anywhere else, so he went to fight in the army. Turns out he's some mythical warrior from ancient japanesetimes and he ♥♥♥♥s all the♥♥♥♥♥♥up. The game is for babies who can't afford $60 counterparts like Black♥♥♥♥♥ and modernwoofare 2. There is explosions and tanks anything a MAYYYYUNNN could want. Also, when you join a server...you die immediately. It's like running uphill whilst a giant manly man with a slightly-homosexual moustache proceeds to push you down the mountain. The reason it is bad company 2 is because the game was made by a bad company, but they already made the first one on  Xbawkses and Playstaion tripple. Don't waste 20 dollars on this, go buy me minecraft instead. You rather unsavory character. This game has an auschwitz death camp scene (lol :D) and lots of rainbow Stalins.

												Returning to this BC2 every now and then even after 6 years.For me the definite version of battlefield infantry combat, with great maps and excellent class balance. The battlefield franchise didn't have destructive environments until the Bad Company series, and BC2 still has some of the best, totally destructible environments.Top notch audio and visuals that in my opinion have kept up surprisingly well over the 6 past years.FUN and INTERESTING single-player campaign, arguably the best still of all Battlefield SP experiences.AMAZING, FUN and ADDICTIVE multi-player with great maps, iconic weapons and a compact progression system for each class.Don't know why I haven't written a review for BC2 before, at less than 10€ (currently 2,49€) this classic is an absolute bargain.BUY IT AND ENJOY, I BEG OF YOU!

												This game is an old classic. For me, better than new Battlefields (1, 4, 3, Hardline). I don't know why but it is just perfectGraphics+ Very good detail, textures, terrain for year 2010Gameplay+ Didn't see any glitches or anything like that, no bugs.- Sometimes you will have to shoot your whole clip/magazine to a player to kill him. Pretty badCampaign+ Very good campaign, great and funny story. + I didn't have any problems with any missions. In this game there is no ""stuck"" mission. (If you know what i mean by that)Multiplayer+ Very good multiplayer, pretty hard to level up when you are new to the game but thats okay.- This may not be bad for everyone, but maybe for some of you is. You have servers which players create, not developers so there are a couple of modded servers. Look out for that because it will totally destroy your experience and you will lose a lot of fun. My friend did it and he stopped playing it after a couple of hours because he had everything.MP Guns+ A lot of guns for all classes+- This isn't bad it doesn't change gameplay that's why i put +-. There are only two scopes in the game. Reflex/red dot and 4x Acog scope. MP Vehicles+ A lot of vehicles to choose from quad bikes to helicopters. Altough I don't know if there are jets because I didn't play conquest only rush because that's my favourite game mode. :/Maps+ A lot of maps without same enviromentOverall I would rate this game10/10Very good game, my favourite Battlefield I fully recommend this game "

People even play Vietnam DLC :)Important thing though, when You try to find a game go to browse servers and press ""search"".

												Occasionally I fall back on BFBC2 to play the great campaign. Here's my review. I don't write a lot, and there's not much chance this will reach the front, but to those who read this:  It's worth the 20$ (standalone price).   Battlefield Bad Company 2 is the sequel to the original. I have not played the original, but from the campaign and the witty characters, I can tell the company has a strong bond (at least in this game). Battlefield Bad Company 2 has a great storyline to it, and develops the story line very interesting. It also balances out storyline with gameplay - meaning that you won't have 30-minute-long story cuts (exaggerations), but instead be able to be part of the action. For instance - you're sneaking on an enemy and your team intends on going about the job in a sneaky way. You have only your trust combat knife, and there's 1 enemy at the watchtower you need to take out to get the job clean. The story doesn't do it for you; you have to creep up (crouch) and sneakily assassinate him. After that, the story may resume.  The story, again, is very detailed and nicely planned. It is not something someone made up within a day - it is something made up within weeks, or even months.  The only downside is that the campaign is really short. You can finish it within a couple hours, at most a day or two. Still, it's worth it.  Since this is 20$ and it is 7 year of age (up to this review), the game has not been updated, but has been kept alive. There are about 20 or so multiplayer servers hosted in a multitude of countries that keep the multiplayer section still running, for when you finish that really quick campaign.   The game's way of playing is unlike anything else. It's like a regular schooter, but you will see that within the multiplayer, and a little bit of singleplayer, you will have to use other things. For example, there are 4 classes; Assault, Medic, Recon, and Engineer ( ***please note that in the single player you can change up primariers and secondaries and you do not have classes***). The Assault is a basic class; usual primary with an auto/burstfire rifle and a pocket pistol. The Recon is a somewhat complex class; you have a motion sensor ball that when thrown will recieve radio signals. If you're on the US side, and you hear english, there are teammates nearby. If you're on the US side, and you hear russian, there are enemies by [and you need to start poppin' some ruskis, no hate to my russians] and vice-versa. The Recon also has about 5 C4's. You can lay down C4 and with a right-click, they detonate. C4's are highlighted with detailed circles on your mini-map and while visible. What's fun is that you can attach C4's onto your car (in MP) and drive them into enemy tanks or just enemy territory, get out, and set off the C4's, making funny kills. Recon comes with a sniper rifle and pistol. The Medic class usually comes with a defibrillator and you can resurrect teammates. I have seen this, but in old servers - it may be removed in newer ones. Medic has a PKM usually (or any LMG) and, of course, a pistol. The Engineer is my favorite class. Usually, this class comes with a silenced machine-pistol (or SMG), and a regular pistol. The Engineer, in MP, has a rocket launcher (usually just the russian RPG), which will prove to be very helpful when blowing up enemy tanks and/or jeeps / ATVs.  The engineer class also comes with a power-drill that can heal vehicles, any vehicle (probably don't want to do it on your enemy's vehicle though) and can also kill. Yes, you can kill with a power drill, and yes, it's very funny.   In the end, this game is really amazing, even after years of being on the Steam shop. Its campaign may be short, but Multiplayer will definitely suit your needs. Multiplayer is also the most fun, depending on how you are.  In short, for $20 and with an age of 5+ years (at the time of this review 7 years), Battlefield: Bad Company 2 serves as a great game overall regardless of its short campaign, which it makes up for again with the multiplayer. I sincerely recommend this game for nostalgia, battlefield playstyle, and fun times with an FPS game. Consider the $20 worth it.  "

												Battlefield : Bad Company 2 might be the only current-gen/next-gen Battlefield game to not be stained by EA greediness. Just wait before the franchise turns into a free-to-play game with microtransactions and before it invades the Android platform.The community is still active even nowadays. And yet the game is still the most overlooked Battlefield of the franchise. "

												I enjoyed this game a lot. There are 2 major down sides to this game and the rest is basically great. The biggest issue for me would be the lack of online players. It has been 5 years since the game has launched so the loss of the community is no suprize, but it's still a con. Another one would be it's optimization. From what I have noticed is my game gets a constant 10fps on minimum graphics with a GTX 750ti, now this is the first 20 minutes after starting the game up. After this point the game gets 60fps fine on max graphics. I don't know why this happens, but it does. Of course now for the pros right. Well I find it hard to specify specific parts of the game that make it as good as it is. The driving and shooting fell good with little to no aim assist. The campaign is pretty well put together and has some weird glitches starting and finishing a cutscene, but nothing gamebreaking. The actual campaing has 2 main areas a snow desert and a jungle which both look very well for 2010. The Jungle reminds me of Halo 3 the mission sierra 117 persoanlly. The button layout isn't ideal at start, but you can configure that so who cares. I do reccomend playing with atleast 1 friend because then you can play on a serrver alone with your friend/friends. This can be a lot of fun and will allow you to do fun glitches or just d**king around. I reccomend this game if you enjoy the battlefield series, have a group of friends that will play with you, and for nistolgia of course.			"

												Still goin strong. Lots of active servers, but you will some familiar names often. The game holds up well, still havin fun after pouring many hours into it and even getting tired of it on xbox. Has a few more glitches than its console version, and they will get on your nerves sometimes. Not for the faint of heart, but highly recommended.HOWEVER - I DO NOT RECCOMMEND VIETNAM DLCThere is never more than 3-4 servers poulated, and each server has a ping difference of about 300. So there is usually only 1 server with decent ping, and it can often be filled with people waiting in que.When you get into a match its usually completely lopsided with veteran players stacking teams with friends, while the other team is often getting spawn camped ENTIRE ROUNDS. I do not exaggerate, it was like this with the 20 or so matches ive played thus far(all spanning within a couple months time)I am so sad, because this DLC was more fun for me than the vanilla game. i put COUNTLESS hours into it on console(i actually freaking recommend console>pc for this title)			"

												It’s sad that this will be the last we will see of Battlefield on Steam. That said, there hasn’t been a single player like it in Battlefield since this game. Battlefield 3 and 4 fell victim to generic guys shooting other guys kinda story while Bad Company 2 had unique characters that made you care about them.Battlefield needs a campaign like this; All of the military being as professional as ever and then your team, abusing the vehicles and weapons given to them. If anything the campaign should have more freedom in it’s gameplay to allow objectives to be completed in multiple ways that would also reward a players creativity.I played the game, I laughed, I feel bad there isn’t a Bad Company 3.

												Let me tell you a story. A story of a certain soldier, named Tom.  He was very unexperienced, and didn't really know what he was doing. He deployed with his squad, who all got orders to rush straight into a tank. Tom didn't rush, however. Tom was clever. He quickly fell to the ground and laid there. The tank, after killing his whole squad, drove past Tom and did not notice him. At that point, Tom was in the middle of a field, surrounded by enemies and, if he made one wrong move, would be spotted and shot down by the enemy snipers. He thought ""why didn't I rush? I bet that tank was one rocket away from exploding, and yet, I just didn't attack it"".  Tom laid there, waiting for the innevitable. Finaly, after gaining the courage, he stood up, and started running to the closest cover possible. Everything turned blurry, as he was being suppressed by sniper fire. ""This is it"" he said to himself while running, ""I'm not fast enough"". A bullet hit Tom straight in the chest. Luckily, it didn't kill him, but he felt as if he was one hit from a pistol away from dying. As he counted the time between the shots, suddenly, they stopped. After getting into cover near a rock, Tom met a friendly squad consisting of a Medic and a Sniper. After shouting ""I need a medic!"" about 50 times, the friendly Medic dropped Tom a kit, and, within 10 seconds Tom felt as if he had just deployed. The sniper yelled ""Move up!"" and the medic took out a huge assault rifle. Tom prepared to Move Up aswell. The sniper took out his pistol and made a dash for a nearby jeep. The medic started running behind him. Tom stood up aswell, but he was far behind the Squad. Suddenly, as the jeep was about to ride off, it started Honking like crazy. It didn't drive. It could've driven. It was in a dangerous field, but, the driver still waited for Tom to get in. He ran as fast as he could, shouting ""Thanks!"" atleast three times.>Tank from before killed them.10/10 would meet amazing people for 3 minutes and then never meet them again.			"

												This is, in my honest opinion, the best of the Battlefield games. The maps are the perfect size. The gun play is very rewarding and statisfying. Vehicles aren't as prevalent as BF3 and BF4 (a con to some, a pro to me.) The player base on PC is still pretty decent. This is a great pickup for any FPS/Battlefield enthusiast. It has tons of time sink potential and is just plain fun. I had previously played a good amount on Xbox 360 around 2010-2012 and revisited it on the 360 last year. It still feels like a damn good game and has aged very well.			"

												In this installment, the Bad Company crew again find themselves in the heart of the action, where they must use every weapon and vehicle at their disposal to survive. In Battlefield: Bad Company 2, the 'B' company fight their way through snowy mountaintops, dense jungles and dusty villages. With a heavy arsenal of deadly weapons and a slew of vehicles to aid them, the crew set off on their mission and they are ready to blow up, shoot down, blast through, wipe out and utterly destroy anything that gets in their way. Total destruction is the name of the game, delivered as only the DICE next generation Frostbite engine can.			"

												23/2Still the king of FPS.BF3 and BF4 and Hardline didn't live up to this.No COD lives up to this. TF2 almost lives up to it, but doesn't.BF 2142 was EPIC....But Ea killed the community.CSGO sucks. Nothing is so satisfying in any game I've ever played. Definitley one of my favorite games I've ever played.Combat feels so chaotic and alive. its the best. buy it and vietnam or else. its great.Just a little warning-this game is old. many players on it are EXTREMLY good by now, like sniping from across the map good. You're going to be awful at first, but you'll get better. trust me.To browse multiplayer servers, just go to the multiplayer tab, click browse servers, and then just click the search button and you'll get a complete list of all running servers.BUY IT NOWPS-EA, please, please, please PLEASE don't do to this game what you did to the first four BF games(all of which were fantastic). I sense that you're evil presence has set it's eye on the Bad Company games, as they are SOOO much more fun to play than flipin Hardline, or even BF4. Please don't try to kill this. I will never buy a game because the publisher used it to replace something they didn't want people sticking to because they know it's not borderline broken, and arguably more fun. I also have nothing against DICE. Just felt like I'd say that, but the only thing that's wrong with them is that they've unfourtunatley become a corporate pawn for EA, just like visceral and bioware. If DICE visceral and bioware left EA, EA's corrupt slave empire would die in months.			"

												Still worth every penny. However, the field of view on this game is incredibly low. Consequently, I am struggling to play the game as it is like looking into a zoomed-in camera all the time. I couldn't find any in-game setting for this issue, so I reverted to tweaking the option manually. Unfortunately, this never seemed to work. The very low FOV may not be an issue to most people, however it can make me feel slightly ill and it makes it more difficult to play the game.			"

												Possibly the greatest shooter of its time.BFBC2 was and still is an excellent shooter. The game is built on the classic and well done squad based shooter. There are 4 different classes, Assault, Engineer, Medic and Recon. Each class has it's own specific weaponry and perks which it can use to alter the way the class plays. For example, do you want to be a long range support sniper? Choose a high calibre rifle and mortat strike. Want to play close recon? Choose an SMG or a sniper with a red dot scope, tracking orbs and something like C4. This is viable for all classes. One thing that this game is excellent is, is weapon balance. Yes there are still standout choices, but every gun has a niche that it can sit in nicely. I mainly play Medic, and loved playing the Spas12 with long range SS shells, and magnum ammo. Medics can also easily play with the non-class specific SMGs or rifles, or play as a heavy support class with LMGs, all of which are equally balanced depending on how you want to play; up close with the M60, or further back with a lower recoil like MG9 for example. The whole shooter is balanced excellently. The vehicles are somewhat difficult to counter at times, but this is normally because they are played by good pilots or drivers. An Apache chopper with a skilled gunner will cause havoc, unless your team can club together, tag the chopper and RPG it; or maybe a sniper can take it down. The whole game is based on team co-operation; in stark contrast to dumb shooters like CoD, which rely on pounding as many kills from spawn trapping and kill streaks. These don't exist in BFBC2, and the game is hugely more enjoyable from it. The game is still active even with the release of BF3 and BF4, and that is because the game is fun, balanced and enjoyable, and Hardcore is a must.			"

												I've been enjoyed BF games since Desert Combat in 2003, and BC2 stands tall as one of the best in the series.  The game finally has a single player game that isn't insultingly bad, but BF is best as a multiplayer team based objective game.  The singleplayer is interesting and tells a quixotic story of four soldiers on a mission to recover something-or-other and has them globetrotting to visually exciting environments. It's like Call of Duty but not so ham-fisted with the rhetoric; you'll still wince though.  Multiplayer SHINES LIKE A DIAMOND.  Map variety is pleasing, and the lethality of the weapons is very satisfying and balanced. Teamplay support is VERY enforced enabling a strong sense of contributing to the whole. You WANT to help your team. Respawning is handled smartly, and unlocks + upgrades are very worthwhile. Every class soldier is fun and a unique style that is compelling to play over and over again with numerous ways to customize and finesse your approach.  100% worthy.			"

												This game is absolutely amazing. The multiplayer is outstanding, easily competing with any great multiplayer game you can think of. There was once a time for about 5 months that this was the only game I played. It was that good. The singleplayer was a let down though. I liked the first game's singleplayer better than this because the characters were more funny and I liked the sandbox style better in the previous title. The only thing that the singleplayer has that is better than BC1 is the story. It was actually a little above decent, and the best BF story so far. Another great thing about the Bad Company Spin-Off series is the soundtrack. They nailed it on most of their songs, and they are so good I have a few on my IPod. DICE has the great composers to write these great orchestral pieces, and they really show that off here. If you liked the phonominal BC1 soundtrack, this will please, it is just a little darker, which does fit the series nicely. Overall, this is an amazing game, worth buying any day.			"

												I did my research before purchasing this game, and it definitely paid off. The campaign is enjoyable, but unfortunately, not too memorable - however, the cons end there. Of course, this game is most well-known for it's astounding multiplayer experience - many say the best in the Battlefield franchise - and it definitely lives up to, even surpasses, expectations. It is incredibly thrilling and intense - I often find myself leaning closer to the screen to make out an enemy sniper in the distance, or stopping and turning my character side to side in order to pinpoint the direction of footsteps or gunfire. There is a large enough range of firearms to keep a player interested for awhile, and plenty of perks and attachments to mix and match. The map and weapon design, and graphic style in general are beautiful, even on the lowest settings, and each game mode provides new tactics and exciting motives for both teams. Finally, no other videogame, that I've encountered at least, has purely awesome moments quite like this one. Perhaps you'll parachute over an enemy tank, chuck some C-4 down and get the vehicle kill, then mow down an entire squad Rambo-style with your M249 SAW LMG and top it off by capturing the point. Or maybe you prefer a stealthier approach - spotting an enemy on the other side of the map zooming around in an ATV, scoping in with your M-95 sniper rifle, calculating the bullet-drop and lead distance correctly and nailing the headshot on the moving target. Then the building you're hiding in takes a tank shell and begins to collapse, so you leap out of the falling structure, knife another unsuspecting soldier down below, and detonate the final M-COM to win your team the game. The possibilities are virtually endless, and each one is more epic than the last.I could go on, but I don't want to spoil anything else. This game is absolutely worth the price it asks for, and I guarantee it will have you playing for hours on end.			"

With a heavy arsenal of deadly weapons and a slew of vehicles to aid them, the crew set off on their mission and they are ready to blow up, shoot down, blast through, wipe out and utterly destroy anything that gets in their way. Total destruction is the name of the game - either online or offline, enemies will soon learn there is nowhere to hide.			"

												Although PC users where shunned from the first Battlefield: Bad Company (BF: BC), BF: BC2 more than makes up from this oversight and doesn't require you to have played the original. The singleplayer of BF: BC2 is short, but fun with an unusual set of characters that will leave you somewhat satisfied. However, the multiplayer aspect of the game is where BF: BC2 shines brighter than any other first-person shooter (FPS) to date. Using the Frostbite engine, BF: BC2 offers destructible environments and class-based modern warfare that offers 4 total classes (Assault, Engineer, Medic and Recon). The multiplayer is a blast and well worth the money for FPS enthusiasts.The special acquisition (SPECACT) kit upgrade for Battlefield: Bad Company 2 (BF: BC2) holds a few advantages for players who are multiplayer fanatics. The SPECACT essentially doubles your classes by allowing you to choose either the default skins or the SPECACT skins that are denoted by their SA tags (e.g. Assault, Assault SA, Engineer, Engineer SA, etc). It also gives you access to a few new weapon choices that are only camouflaged editions of select default weapons such as the M95 SA, the UMP 45 SA, etc. These additions can be used to earn more kill stars for more points. It should be noted that purchasing this DLC kit will give you a CD-Key that you must redeem via BF: BC2's in-game menu while logged into your EA account.The Vietnam expansion is a multiplayer addition for Battlefield: Bad Company 2. The game's mechanics play the same, but with more maps and weapons built around the Frostbite engine. The multiplayer for Battlefield: Bad Company 2 has always been the core component for the game and the Vietnam expansion provides a worthwhile investment for more action-packed fun for Battlefield fans. It should be noted that the maps are set in a jungle environment that limits destruction 2.0.			"

												Bad Company 2 finds a nice medium between the communication-reliant tacticality of Battlefield 2 and the arcadey run-n-gun of more conventional arena shooters. It rewards teamwork, but it's just as fun to hop in a server solo and find your own place in the warzone. It has many unlockable weapons that allow for a variety of gameplay methods, and the maps span the range from close-quarters urban areas to vast plains where vehicles are all but mandatory. Speaking of which, infantry has more of a focus in this game so they're not just fodder for the few players that nab a plane or tanks- a change from previous titles in the franchise's history. Though the physics, collision, hit detection, and netcode can be buggy occasionally, the rest of the time makes up for it with exciting, tense, fulfilling action.Being such an old game, however, the amount of servers is dwindling, but you can still find matches. You just can't be as picky with server options.			"

												Battlefield Bad Comapny 2 is one of the best Battlefield games in the franchise.If you love destruction and playing as a team and want a challenge well BF BC 2 is the game for you and your friends.From gamemodes there is Rush.TDM.SQDM(Squad Deathematch) and  CQ(Conquest),in Rush there are two team's the defenders and the attackers and there are 6 sets of M-COMS and the attackers have to destroy those objectives and the defenders have to prevent that from happening.On Qonquest there are 3 flags through out the map and the teams have to battle each other on who has captured more flags not like CTF(Capture the flag).The guns on the game are unlocked when you either Level up or earing points by killing people with a certain class,the classes are |Recon| |Assault| |Medic| and |Engineer|.On the game are also vehicles like Tanks,Helicopters and jeeps so you can move through out the map.So i would really recomend BF BC2 for a guy that loves FPS games and action and i would recomend playing this game with a friend so you can have a bit more fun because when you play alone sometimes it can get a little boring.Thank you.

												This is the game that killed Battlefield 3 & 4 for me. Instead of scripted destruction peppered with minor property destruction, you have full blown destruction of buildings and roads. When you can drive a tank through a a building to destroy the payload or call in a mortar strike on a house and kill 5 people along with the payload.The combat feels more intense and more interesting than the current Battlefield games. The single player campaign is also far more entertaining the generic COD clone that are found in the current games. Get the Vietnam DLC and you get a flamethrower, Hamburger Hill, Fortunate Son in the main menu and Rise of the Valkyries while you drive your flame thrower tank.			"

												Bad Company 2 provides a decent hold-over until the eagerly awaited Battlefield 3. Taking the Battlefield 2 approach, but scaling it down to smaller, more linear maps with a heavy emphasis on target destruction. While hit detection is much better, it still lacks the open-ness of it's predecessors.It's ""more of the same"" but with the heavy influence from the console-only release and while not bad, it doesn't absolutely delight like Battleifeld 2 did. This is a fair game to grab to hold you over till the release of Battlefield 3.			"

												This is the game that killed Battlefield 3 & 4 for me. Instead of scripted destruction peppered with minor property destruction, you have full blown destruction of buildings and roads. When you can drive a tank through a a building to destroy the payload or call in a mortar strike on a house and kill 5 people along with the payload.The combat feels more intense and more interesting than the current Battlefield games. The single player campaign is also far more entertaining the generic COD clone that are found in the current games. Get the Vietnam DLC and you get a flamethrower, Hamburger Hill, Fortunate Son in the main menu and Rise of the Valkyries while you drive your flame thrower tank.			"

												Battlefield Bad Company 2 is quite possibly my favorite battlefield game that is still operational (RIP BF2 and BF2142). At its core it is a class based multiplayer shooter, but it also has a lovable singleplayer cast. I will try to outline my favorite parts of this game and hopefully y'all will find this helpful!Technical StuffGetting this game to run well was a pain at first because the default configuration files are horrid.  Thanks to a few Steam guides though, it is easy to troubleshoot your issues and fix them promptly. Something is seriously wrong with the DX11 renderer but once I switched it to DX9, my frame rate sat comfortably in the 100's with no noticeable stuttering. To add to this, the visuals between DX11 and DX9 are nigh-identical so you won't be missing out on any of the graphical goodness. The game's visuals hold up beautifully for a 6 year old game. The explosions will give you wargasms; the sound system of this game is unmatched by other Battlefield titles. There is nothing like hearing your assault rifle behave differently when you are firing inside confined spaces and outside of structures. All in all a fantastic visual and audio experience once you get the renderer to behave.Singleplayer (Whats that?)Compared to the last bad company title, the BFBC2 campaign takes itself a bit more seriously, but it still manages to pull off some of the humorous moments that the first game was known for. Haggard is as absurdly Redneck as they come and Sweetwater still talks faster than the RPM of a boat propeller. Sarge has postponed his retirement once again to lead our band of misfits through a crazy explosion filled adventure. Battlefield games are not known for their single player campaigns, but I suggest that you play a few missions and see if you like the flavor. You might enjoy it as much as I did.MultiplayerTo find servers on the server browser, you must hit the ""Search"" button to populate the server listBFBC2 Multiplayer is alive and well to this day which is quite a feat for a 6 year old game. Many servers are populated throughout the day which means you will be able to get the Bad Company experience any time you so desire. It is worth noting that all Map Pack DLC is included with the PC version of the game; absolutely glorious and I wish DICE still continued this practice. The multiplayer is class based. You can chose from the rifle wielding Assault, the SMG toting Engineer, the LMG lugging Medic, and the Sniper Rifle carrying Recon. The Recon kit is not solely a sniper! Use your gadgets to help your team reconnoiter an area and stop trying to get your MLG pro-scope montages. This isn't the game for that. Each class has a variety of gadgets designed to support the team and mastering the use of these gadgets is very rewarding!SummaryClass based multiplayerGuns have beefy sounds, it doesn't feel like you are playing with water squirters!No proliferation of useless unlocks. The game has around 7-8 different primary weapons per class, each feels different and has a different role. Once you unlock a weapon optic you get it for ALL of your weapons of that class. There aren't 50 types of ""elite holographic heartbeat sensing aimbot gunsights"" in this gameOptics are not needed to use your weapons effectively! Most of the time you best off with iron sights and using your ability slot for something more helpful.You can stick a dang red dot on a .50 caliber bolt action rifle! How isn't that awesome?!Gunplay feels solid. Be sure to tap-fire at longer ranges!Tanks feel like Tanks! You aren't driving a soggy cardboard box and you feel like a total badass if you use it properly!Maps feel like they were designed for each specific game mode. Rush plays like Rush and Conquest plays like Conquest. You will not feel that you are playing a map for a different game modeNo stupid knifing animations. No counter-knifing either!If you can see it, you can blow it up! Nearly every building can be brought down with the ""careful"" removal of a few walls (Blow that crap up with explosives and watch the collapse crush your enemies!) New battlefield games have lost this destructibility, but Bad Company does it right! The battlefield will feel like a warzone as the battle drags on; what once was a quaint village transforms to a pile of flaming rubble while troops fight over the scraps!Do I recommend this game? Absolutely! I played this game endlessly on console until I made the switch to PC. This game is great fun for newcomers to the series and long-time veterans like myself!			"

												BF: BC2 is a good game, campaign is fun but overall it changes what the main story is about. First its about finding a nuke which was basically it then in the 6th mission it introduces a new character we have to kill which we do in the last mission. Multi is fun but the players get your from anywhere not even with a sniper gun, a high damage sniper gun needs 2 body shots to kill someone. The Vietnam map pack is great!Pros:Good CampaignFun MultiPerfect Expansion!Cons:AI somewhat dumb?The Vietnam map pack is so fun but it isn't really worth $15, should have a mini campaign in it tooThe Creating a class not like CoD, its hard, you don't choose the guns you want but with the DLC, you get camo for your sniper outfit :)8.7/10----Thanks for reading my review!

												Good game, the only two problems, I have are server admins are little communists. For example you say one offensive word BANNED. Say one cuss word BANNED. Critize teammates BANNED. Also people revive to mcuh.. I know thats weird to complain about but in this game it counts a death and people will revive you 4 times in a row under 5 sec and that counts as 4 deaths.			"

												One of the greatest games i ever played. 1.Its insane the level of destruction you can make with your weapons,you can literaly destroy anything.2.The game gameplay was pretty good and you have the chance to play with a big variety of weapons.3.You can also drive a lot of vehicle such as tank,armored cars,helicopters and other bad♥♥♥♥♥shit.4.The graphicks are awesome and you have a big a option system to choose from.Its just the perfect war game.

												I'd recommend this game, but it has some major problems.1. WAY WAY too much smoke and dust clouds. Even a short spray of bullets will cause a cloud of dust that takes awhile to disappear, even when you shot at something like a window frame, wall corner, door frame, etc.2. The vehicles suck, for the most part.3. No option for team deathmatch, only Squad Deathmatch. (4 teams of 4 against each other)4. No option for free for all deathmatch.5. Every Squad Deathmatch map has one tank that continues to spawn. It's annoying and wasn't a good choice of vehicle for Squad Deathmatch. Humvees or 4-wheelers would have worked better. Maybe a few boats on the maps that have water. 6. Only sniper rifles can be equipped with a sniper scope.7. Heli control(s) suck, and minigun control (that the heli's are equipped with) also suck.  8. Way too few maps for Squad Deathmatch option, and the maps for the other gametypes are often large with not enough buildings/cover/good landscape for a battle. Why not just spawn us all in an open field?9. Extreme lack of good urban environment maps.10. This is one of the worst things about the game. Accuracy is ridiculously crappy when you aren't looking through your sights/optics. You can fire at a stationary guy 20 feet away and maybe get 3-6 out of 30 of your shots to actually hit him. If you need to be looking down your sights to get more than 1/10-1/5 accuracy from 20 feet away, then you probably shouldn't be anywhere near a battlefield. In real life if I was shooting from that distance, every one of the those shots would have met their target. Seeming as how most of the assault rifles used by assault class are chambered in 5.56mm, they should by little to no issue with recoil. The game's designers, however, thought that it best to give rifles chambered in 5.56mm the accuracy and recoil of an automatic shotgun being fired by a small child with Muscular Dystrophy.11. This one isn't as big of a deal to me, but there's no option to go prone.			"

And the money for the Game worth it realy, even too for 20€.I didn't checked the Single player, because I prefer Multiplayer modus.About the Multiplayer: The servers are still fresh, alot of players, and over 20 servers 24/7 with 32/32 players.I didnt expectet that, so it get's a big Plus on this.The game engine in the Multiplayer is too legendary, you can destroy almost every house, every tree, and the Game still works with high FPS. The keyboard settings are little bit different, like other games. I tryd to set the Keyboard on other keys, but got alot problems, and didn't got it. Also the menu is not flexible.The teamplay is too awesome on this game, not like COD everyone for his owne. Ther is real teamplay on the Battlefield.The register to EA was too very smart, you dont have to run somethink else. Anythink smart and fine, how gamers want it.The level system is extremly slowly, you have to play alot to reach levels, but it's okey. Maybe the weapon system is a bad, you dont have much weapons to choose at the begin, and even after hours. You have to play your classes up, to get weapons for this class only. Ther are too All class weapons, this weapon can be used for everyone's class, so you got a little bit weapon choose. Maybe you get a higher level you got more weapons to choose. The audio is too very good, surround audio works fine, and it sounds like a war.Multiplayer servers / players: ★★★★★Game Engine: ★★★★★Gameplay: ★★★★✰Weapons / Level system: ★★★★✰Audio: ★★★★★Also the game is at all awesome, and worth it to buy!

												Appropriately enough Bad Company 2 begins by kicking the doors in and unloading a shotgun blast of thrills in your face. Following a brief, straightforward prologue you’re pitched into the snowy wastes of Alaska (not to mention 24-style intrigue) as the Bad Company boys stumble across a Russian plot involving a terrifying experimental weapon. Given that almost every gun you can pick up here doubles as a grenade launcher, that’s quite a threat.			"

												Let us not ask what a Battlefield is until we know what it really is like to have a Christmas party with the in-laws.Imagine a game of RISK that you're trying to win against a so-called family member that isn't even related to you. Now think about how much you want to beat the crap out of him. Now think about how his wife doesn't want to shut up about the war and how it's poisoning the minds of our children. That's real Bad Company.Oh you were asking about the game. It's pretty cool.			"

												So, i have been playing Battlefield games recently. I've played BF3,BF4,BF:H and BFBC2. And i really enjoy playing BF games, one thing i like about the game is the multiplayer. Of course, BF multiplayer is something that a BF player usually looks out for. BF multiplayer gives you a big,open war with many players where you can choose your own way to win the round. But when i have just bought this game, it turned out that EA has no longer supports this game. You can no longer make a new account, if you are new to BFBC2. If you have already made an account, you can still play, servers are still online and there are many players who are still playing with this game.And being honest, i like the story of the game, the story is so fun, you can do whatever you like to accomplish the mission. Characters are well voiced and the map is vast and huge. But when i know i can't play the multiplayer, i'll give this game a thumb down. I'm sorry, i wish EA had given us more time to create a new account, for those who have just bought BFBC2 and wanted to play multiplayer. A battlefield game without multiplayer is nothing.			"

												Quite simply the best Battlefield game, in my humble opinion of course. This goes back to the time when DICE not only understood the value of balance and symmetry, but could actually execute it in a game. And balance and symmetry have never been more sexy since. So much of the stuff in this game is just done extraordinarily well. Its a great blend of fast and furious gunplay and tactical teamwork, that you just don't really see anymore.			"

												Batllefield is not about the single player; it is more out about working out your grpahics card to get o the most out of this first person shooter out on the battlefield.The sound of each bullet will get your heart throbbing and pounding. You will feel that you are really out there on the battlefield and yet you are not alone. The best feeling of comfort and a game changin expereience. Yes, ONE good squad can out do the whole opposing team because the real soldiers are built that way. You can outsmart the enemy team with proper equipment and class of a soldier.Choose your game type first.. REVIVE as a medic, Dominate as a soldier, Destroy as a Mechanic or ALERT as a sniper. Now scout for new friends to fill out the missing roles of the squad. Trust me you will dominate.What if i tell you this:- YOU CAN FLY- YOU CAN DESTROY but- It is a whole different story when you can REVIVE YOUR BEST FRIENDThis is a must buy for all fps lovers .period.ONLY IN BATTLEFIELD-GODSPEED			"

												So far there are a t least 20 minutes of cinematics, that you cannot skip within the first hour of the game.  The screen jumps around too much...first of all, when an AA gun fires, yes, it shakes the ground, but it doesn't shake your weapon independently of the person holding it (I know this to be true...I've actually done this in Real Life).  Was hoping this game would be more like a game than a movie...if I'd wanted a movie, I'd have gotten one off of netflix.  This game is childsplay...for kids who know no better.  If you are looking for a game that requires skill, innovation, and challenge...don't get this one...its the worst one (other than BF3) that I've ever played.  Very dissapointed after playing BF 1942.			"

												A good all rounder, if you can still find game servers with people in it.Pros: You can do fun things in this game, stack C4 bombs on things.Sniper rifles are usable. Voiceovers are great. The mini UAV in this game is funny as hell, its a toy helicopter. You do not need a squad, M2CG can make you a one man army. Cons: Carl Gustav is overpowered. Maps are small and some flag capture points are deathtraps, you can place mines in the water and any vehicles that drive over them during capture is instantly destroyed. There is no time limit, only ticket depletion. You have to launch the game to browse for servers. The DLC has no players in this region. Level 50 cap.Ammo boxes refill all ammo in a very short time, including explosives. If you want a physical advantage, you can't have a weapon mod.			"

												Very brief mention - this is a REVIEW. I hope people get the common ♥♥♥♥ing sense to write REVIEWS on these pages instead of little stories or cooking recipes. It and anybody who does that are completely pathetic.Now, moving on...I was a veteran of this game on the Xbox 360 - when I say veteran, I mean I recognize the sounds of each gun being shot from afar, even the suppressed weapons. I got lots of enjoyment out of it, and I couldn't help but ""upgrade"" to the PC version. I upgraded for several reasons:1) I felt that more people played the PC version, since that's the target console of the series.2) I was sure that the graphics would be improved on the PC.3) I would be able to browse servers instead of just doing a mandatory quick match on the 360.Within about half an hour I got all three of those points addressed.1) There are FAR more people on the PC version as opposed to the Xbox 360. There aren't tons of full servers, but there are still a rather stunning number of people with taste in terms of Battlefield games.2) The graphics. Holy CRAP. 60 fps without tweaking a single setting. Overwhelming lighting effects. Much larger and more detailed levels.3) Server browsing is just as useful as I suspected it would be. There is a glitch, however, where when you start up the game and go under server browsing, there's an empty list - don't fret; the fix is to simply press ""Search"", and they all load in.Now, in terms of gameplay; it's perfectly balanced and hectic gameplay that rewards players of all playstyles, both infantry and vehicular. It stays basic without falling to the crap that Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4 brought to the table; there's none of that ""lengthy reload on an empty magazine"" BS; there's no suppression; you don't wake up from a nap after getting revived, only to get shot again; there's no vehicle healing or crippling; no crazy weapon attachments...None of that crap is present here. If you want more of that, don't buy this game.The singleplayer took a shot to the head in comparison to its predecessor (an Xbox 360/PS3 exclusive; I wish it were on the PC, too :,C), in the regard to how boring it was, and how fast you'll shoot through it. There's a video on YouTube (it should still be up) of somebody beating the campaign in just slightly over THREE HOURS. Enemies die in one or two shots, which renders all challenge moot, everything is scripted and hideously linear, and there's little to no point playing it. The four main characters just become dreadfully unlikable in the campaign; again, in stark opposition to the first game. With the sole exception of Battlefield: Bad Company (1), all BF games' strengths are in their multiplayer.So do I recommend this game? YES. ABSOLUTELY. It was phenomonal on the Xbox 360, and it's equally as nice on the PC. It has better ease-of-access when it comes to finding matches, better graphics, and is just completely mindblowing.And, of course, it has a massive Vietnam War expansion/conversion...			"

												My favorite First Person Shooter of all time. This game is amazing, the campaign, multiplayer and even onslaught mode! The singleplayer is the best in the Battlefield series, the multiplayer is heavily refined and tweaked even better than Battlefield 3 & 4.Then you have Vietanm. THE BEST DLC OF ALL TIME? Most likely, It's an entirly new game. Weapons, Maps and theme! 10/10 MUST BUY!			"

												Hands down the best Battlefield game ever made. The movement control is a little off, but nothing you don't get used to in 10 minutes. The destruction, while not as high in fidelity as later titles, is more fun and actually contributes to gameplay. You won't be hiding behind that cover for long, buddy. (Those who complain about leveled maps are playing too high ticket servers.)The sniping is the best it's ever been. Getting a headshot from thousands of meters away is so rewarding and doesn't just feel like total luck when you do it. A good sniper is a force to be reckoned with and you'll have to work with your team to take them out. None of this permanent scope glare nonsense that BF3-1 has. Every map is memorable and designed with alot of care. Every match feels different.The weapon variety is some of the best in any FPS game. Though BC2 doesn't have the largest selection, every gun is viable and can be mastered if you put in the effort. There is no lock on missiles, which makes flying helicopters a blast. (They may be a little overpowered, but they are fun as hell when you are not on the recieving end.)These seemingly small things make the game infinitely more playable and fun then newer BFs. In my opinion nothing DICE has made since has came close.  BF3, 4 and 1 aren't even in the same league. It's sad that we may never see a BF as good as this one.Why are you even reading reviews? Buy it. "

Good single player and multiplayer gameplay. I have played this a lot more than Steam shows , just with the non steam version on pc.If you love Shooting your way through multiple locations with awesome firefights then This game is for you.By the way as of 09/28/16 there are a lot of Multiplayer servers running.So its still popularwith lots of players.I'm sure you won't have trouble finding a firefight to get in to.

												This review is written after 444+ hours played (mostly not on Steam)Best Battlefield game to this day: Everything you do matters: Tactic decisions, accuracy, knowing enemy positions, taking cover. Balanced maps. 4 balanced classes of soldiers that supports each other. Tanks and helicopters are really fun to play and are also perfectly balanced relative to soldiers. Different equip significantly changes style of your play Beautiful graphics and sound. Many weapons (and every single one has different feel when firing). Different play modes (Rush, Conquest...) Minimal load times (unlike in BF3 a and BF4). No browser plugin or browser required to play the game (unlike BF3 and BF4).And yes... people are still playing this game. Servers are alive (and they are the same servers through Steam like when you play through original CD version).			"

												So far there are a t least 20 minutes of cinematics, that you cannot skip within the first hour of the game.  The screen jumps around too much...first of all, when an AA gun fires, yes, it shakes the ground, but it doesn't shake your weapon independently of the person holding it (I know this to be true...I've actually done this in Real Life).  Was hoping this game would be more like a game than a movie...if I'd wanted a movie, I'd have gotten one off of netflix.  This game is childsplay...for kids who know no better.  If you are looking for a game that requires skill, innovation, and challenge...don't get this one...its the worst one (other than BF3) that I've ever played.  Very dissapointed after playing BF 1942.			"

												A good all rounder, if you can still find game servers with people in it.Pros: You can do fun things in this game, stack C4 bombs on things.Sniper rifles are usable. Voiceovers are great. The mini UAV in this game is funny as hell, its a toy helicopter. You do not need a squad, M2CG can make you a one man army. Cons: Carl Gustav is overpowered. Maps are small and some flag capture points are deathtraps, you can place mines in the water and any vehicles that drive over them during capture is instantly destroyed. There is no time limit, only ticket depletion. You have to launch the game to browse for servers. The DLC has no players in this region. Level 50 cap.Ammo boxes refill all ammo in a very short time, including explosives. If you want a physical advantage, you can't have a weapon mod.			"

Posted: July 17, 2016
												Very brief mention - this is a REVIEW. I hope people get the common ♥♥♥♥ing sense to write REVIEWS on these pages instead of little stories or cooking recipes. It and anybody who does that are completely pathetic.Now, moving on...I was a veteran of this game on the Xbox 360 - when I say veteran, I mean I recognize the sounds of each gun being shot from afar, even the suppressed weapons. I got lots of enjoyment out of it, and I couldn't help but ""upgrade"" to the PC version. I upgraded for several reasons:1) I felt that more people played the PC version, since that's the target console of the series.2) I was sure that the graphics would be improved on the PC.3) I would be able to browse servers instead of just doing a mandatory quick match on the 360.Within about half an hour I got all three of those points addressed.1) There are FAR more people on the PC version as opposed to the Xbox 360. There aren't tons of full servers, but there are still a rather stunning number of people with taste in terms of Battlefield games.2) The graphics. Holy CRAP. 60 fps without tweaking a single setting. Overwhelming lighting effects. Much larger and more detailed levels.3) Server browsing is just as useful as I suspected it would be. There is a glitch, however, where when you start up the game and go under server browsing, there's an empty list - don't fret; the fix is to simply press ""Search"", and they all load in.Now, in terms of gameplay; it's perfectly balanced and hectic gameplay that rewards players of all playstyles, both infantry and vehicular. It stays basic without falling to the crap that Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4 brought to the table; there's none of that ""lengthy reload on an empty magazine"" BS; there's no suppression; you don't wake up from a nap after getting revived, only to get shot again; there's no vehicle healing or crippling; no crazy weapon attachments...None of that crap is present here. If you want more of that, don't buy this game.The singleplayer took a shot to the head in comparison to its predecessor (an Xbox 360/PS3 exclusive; I wish it were on the PC, too :,C), in the regard to how boring it was, and how fast you'll shoot through it. There's a video on YouTube (it should still be up) of somebody beating the campaign in just slightly over THREE HOURS. Enemies die in one or two shots, which renders all challenge moot, everything is scripted and hideously linear, and there's little to no point playing it. The four main characters just become dreadfully unlikable in the campaign; again, in stark opposition to the first game. With the sole exception of Battlefield: Bad Company (1), all BF games' strengths are in their multiplayer.So do I recommend this game? YES. ABSOLUTELY. It was phenomonal on the Xbox 360, and it's equally as nice on the PC. It has better ease-of-access when it comes to finding matches, better graphics, and is just completely mindblowing.And, of course, it has a massive Vietnam War expansion/conversion...			"

												I think this Battlefield will stay as my most favorite one. It is not like the other Battlefield games. Developers decided this time to make maps smaller and more lively. And I must say it worked pretty well. From the other titles they cut of jets and planes, and I personally dont even miss them that much. Game runs on Frostbite 2.0 engine which features completely destructable buildings unlike the one from BF3. I am not sure how BF4 will perform, but I think that I will stay on this title. If you will want to play with somebody. Then I will surely play with you.			"

												I think this Battlefield will stay as my most favorite one. It is not like the other Battlefield games. Developers decided this time to make maps smaller and more lively. And I must say it worked pretty well. From the other titles they cut of jets and planes, and I personally dont even miss them that much. Game runs on Frostbite 2.0 engine which features completely destructable buildings unlike the one from BF3. I am not sure how BF4 will perform, but I think that I will stay on this title.

												Graphics	9A beautifully rendered world, extremely satisfying levels of destruction, grand animations, and an easy to understand interface. Battlefield: Bad Company 2 has it all.Gameplay	9At times, it feels like there are some frustrating balance issues. But those are few and far between. Bad Company 2 is a fantastic game to pick up and go to town with. You'll find glee in causing buildings to crumble around you, planting that charge of C4 on a tank and blowing it up, nailing that perfect headshot from across the map. However, where Bad Company 2 really shines is when you log on with some friends and get coordinated. Communicate and work together to outgun, outflank, and outdo the enemy team.Story	4I'll be honest with you. If you are playing Battlefield games for the story, you're going to be really, really disappointed. While there is a storymode here, it honestly isn't worth much of your time except as a glorified tutorial. The characters do give a few good laughs though.Multiplayer	10As mentioned earlier, Bad Company 2 really shines when you play with friends, but even alone you're going to have a blast with this one. Hours and hours of fun and destruction await you, with several different modes of multiplayer available to choose from. Be warned though, if you join up this late in the game you're going to face some very, very good long-time players.Replayability	9You're going to keep coming back to this one. The peak of the Battlefield series so far, it never gets old racing out of a building as it crumbles around you, covering your team on a withdrawal from an overrun area, or being at the front of a charge to capture a point. Don't miss out on one of the most enjoyable Battlefield experiences yet. The only struggle here is that most your friends will probably have moved on to the new battlefields.Overall9.2/10Though not as popular as it once was (due to the new battlefields) Bad Company 2 still stands at the top of the Battlefield mountain. The Frostbite engine really shines in this iteration. Multiplayer is fast-paced, brutal, and spectacularly fun. Don't like those trees? Mow them down with your LMG. Don't like that building? Blow it up. Your team being overrun? Call in an artillery strike and give them some relief. All in all, an absolute must have for any Battlefield fan.			"

												This review is written after 444+ hours played (mostly not on Steam)Best Battlefield game to this day: Everything you do matters: Tactic decisions, accuracy, knowing enemy positions, taking cover. Balanced maps. 4 balanced classes of soldiers that supports each other. Tanks and helicopters are really fun to play and are also perfectly balanced relative to soldiers. Different equip significantly changes style of your play Beautiful graphics and sound. Many weapons (and every single one has different feel when firing). Different play modes (Rush, Conquest...) Minimal load times (unlike in BF3 a and BF4). No browser plugin or browser required to play the game (unlike BF3 and BF4).And yes... people are still playing this game. Servers are alive (and they are the same servers through Steam like when you play through original CD version).			"

												Hands down the best Battlefield game ever made. The movement control is a little off, but nothing you don't get used to in 10 minutes. The destruction, while not as high in fidelity as later titles, is more fun and actually contributes to gameplay. You won't be hiding behind that cover for long, buddy. (Those who complain about leveled maps are playing too high ticket servers.)The sniping is the best it's ever been. Getting a headshot from thousands of meters away is so rewarding and doesn't just feel like total luck when you do it. A good sniper is a force to be reckoned with and you'll have to work with your team to take them out. None of this permanent scope glare nonsense that BF3-1 has. Every map is memorable and designed with alot of care. Every match feels different.The weapon variety is some of the best in any FPS game. Though BC2 doesn't have the largest selection, every gun is viable and can be mastered if you put in the effort. There is no lock on missiles, which makes flying helicopters a blast. (They may be a little overpowered, but they are fun as hell when you are not on the recieving end.)These seemingly small things make the game infinitely more playable and fun then newer BFs. In my opinion nothing DICE has made since has came close.  BF3, 4 and 1 aren't even in the same league. It's sad that we may never see a BF as good as this one.Why are you even reading reviews? Buy it. "

A great older title that has aged well, but has gone a little senile.Due to the age of the game and EA no longer supporting it, you really only get the Single Player campaign to play unless you made an account when the game was supported. With that said, I'm not sure there'd be much online activity for this game now anyway. This review is for the Single Player campaign only.Despite being a 7 year old game, it has aged gracefully. The visuals are top notch and are still comparable to games released this year. The story is decent, but short. You get 5 hours of solid, unsurprising story. Whimsical characters help populate the experience with some humour, but don’t expect a serious FPS.Age brings about some technical issues with newer systems. Running this on Windows 10, there were frequent technical, but not game-breaking issues. First of all, the physics engine has little freak-outs every now and then. Ragdolls will bounce into the air for no reason and some physics objects do some rather hilarious dance moves.Scripting just doesn’t work sometimes, with funny, but awkward results. In one cutscene, one of the actors failed to load so things were just floating around and reacting to an invisible person. Your AI companions occasionally refuse to advance and will wait for you to do all the work before magically teleporting ahead of you. The funniest thing I found was a bug where a helicopter would have enemies rappel to an area ahead of you, only to have them drop out instead and die. Of a helicopter with six enemies, only one managed to use the rope to rappel down. They should really teach their troops better.I’d say these errors are down to modern systems and older code just not being compatible. In any case, none of it was game-breaking. If you’re looking for a classic, no-frills shooter, then this is still a top game.			"

												This game is still going strong after 7 years! Damn I love it. I just bought the game in the steam summer sale and the gameplay is just amazing. The only problem I have is multiplayer. Since most of the servers are in North America, I get really high ping due to my geographical location. (Not telling u where I live :P) I get over 300 ping in most servers so I usually get kicked out unless I join a server in my area. Other than that, this game is awesome!			"

												My favorite Battlefield game out there, it has a great multiplayer mode which requires team work and communication. The game is a bit old so there aren't too many people playing it, but it's still very possible to find good servers filled with many players. I would also recommend buying the Vietnam DLC which to be honest feels like a standalone game when you play it. I would even say that it is the best DLC ever released for any video game. Bad Company 2 has a great singleplayer campaign as well. It's not very long nor short but it's still very entertaining and anyone who likes FPS games will love this one too !			"

												Alright, so I know this isn't the newest, or the most hyped Battlefield-game out there, but trust me when I tell you, it's a good one. Now I have played the multiplayer mode on a different account, so don't mind the playtime. The multiplayer is really cool, thank's to Frostbite. Almost everything on the battlefield (pun intented) is destructible, which makes no cover 100% certain. The vehicles also bring depth to the multiplayer mode, since you can, for example ride around in a Jeep or fly a chopper. The multiplayer mode is more fun with your friend(s) (surprise), and you can make a 'squad' just for you and your friends. When you're in a squad with your friends, you can spectate them when dead, and you can also spawn next to them when you're ready, so that you don't have to run all the way back from a control point for example. The campaign mode, however, is the thing that interested me so much that I had to buy it for this account. The campaign's story isn't the most cliche one, but it isn't the most interesting one either. But that isn't even the reason why I wanted to get the game. The campaign simply gets you into a certain mood and additude when you play it. That's why I recommend you to play the campaign mode in dark, so that you can really get into it. My favorite part from the campaign so far is a mission, where you have to snipe, in a rain forest, in a thunderstorm/heavy rain, while in the dark. Playing that mission felt like heaven. So much fun. The price tag isn't too bad either, since it's a fairly old game. The PC multiplayer isn't dead either, so you won't have to worry about that. 8,5/10			"
