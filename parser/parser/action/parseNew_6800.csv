												Background:Purchased as part of a bundle from Bundle Stars. I played the first two games in the series to death back when they came out.Impressions:Commandos stands tall among action strategy games. It was a simple formula: a set of men are dropped into a mission, each with a certain set of skills and using them in concert you dismantle the enemies defences and confound their long term goals.While the games does lean heavily on the two most useful characters (Tiny and the Spy) the situations force you to think creatively and apart from a few small instances you are completely free to tackle the mission as you see fit.It's almost bewildering that no game has successfully recaptured the formula since, even the successive games in the franchises have failed to really improve or even live up to this classic piece of strategy.Each mission can take minutes or even several hours to complete on your first run through and while the Merit system on completion gives you a score (based on damage taken, damage done and speed of completion) you can be drawn back to try and complete the mission quicker and more cleverly there is ultimately no reward for doing so.. other than your own satisfaction.The biggest issue is that the Steam version of the game installs poorly and in an almost unusable state. the game runs impossibly fast on modern PCs, the config file is missing the line to allow saving, multicore PCs will make the game unstable and widescreen monitors have black bands at the boarders. thankfully all these can be fixed and I've collated all the fixes I used on the Commandos wikia as noted below.Fixes:See the page on the 'Commandos Wikia' for 'Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines Fixes'.http://commandos.wikia.com/wiki/Fixing_CommandosThe Good:*A classic formula that stands up today for it's simplicity and functions.*Missions can be tackled many ways.*The settings have a historical context and introduced as such.*Missions are diverse.*Fast save/load system makes experimentation less frustrating than you'd think.*Huge sense of triumph from executing a plan that takes out even a single awkward guard.*Looks pretty good considering it's age.The Bad:*Terrible install from Steam that makes the game unplayable without some searching and tweaking.*Merit is heavily determined by speed which I don't find fun.*The leveling mechanic 'Merit' never had a function originally nor now.*Vehicles are overpowered but also limited.*A few missions have an element that only has one solution...*Leading to some missions having to be restarted unless you keep lots of saves.Recommended for: War, Action and isometric strategy fans.Conclusion.9/10. Once the screen, stability and speed issues are fixed it's a huge blast.			"

												Very Good and challing old classic from 90's, when games still reguired use of the head!I might be little biased cause i grew up with games like this but:+Classic+You actually have to think hard, what to and how to do it+Very challinging even in easy difficulty+Limited resources+Contains actual WW2 footage-Visuals are from 90's, but are playable is you dont mind bit less pixels-AI is kinda stupid, so its not reacting realisticly into situtations-Some enemy units might get stuck for short period of time, if they are in alert mode-Personally all most all missions were missing the briefing sounds-Voice actors sound pretty good, but after while you start to get annoyed by constant repeat of ""yes sir"" ""right away sir"" and so on-Vehicles are terrible to drive, but pretty usefullIf you look for game what callenges you,  you dont mind playing game developed in 90's and you dont get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when you fail constantly, then this is for you!

												This is my childhood game. 15 years ago it was too hard for me :)Now it's too easy. and my computer load hundred times faster for this game..back then I had to put CD and loading would take around a minute, quick load still not quickThis is the only commandos that I haven't beat :)I watched some advanced player playing it, and they played like 3-5 minutes per level and back then I took me hours just to beat a level :(you should get this game when it is bundled, I got mine from GMG daily deal.. it was bundled several times. This is one of my favorite when EIdos still exist, now they long gone, some title like Tomb Raider is still continue, but they abandon Commandos. Poor little guy, especially ""Tiny"" who isn't tiny at allbtw, if you are using win 7 or higher, you should find patch because the dev (technically not Eidos, but Square Enix , the now own them) don't really care with very old game like this, you have to manually replace the exe and some dll, and poof the game speed is normal			"

												After a long time they have finally made the game playable.  It wasn't playable before, and I stand by my statement that Steam should not steal peoples money by selling games that do not work.  This is a classic series though and it is nice to be able to play it.  That being said, it is also very dated, and although it will run now, it does not hold up very well with time.  I wouldn't recomend it to anyone who hasnt played this already.  I'd love to see a new game with similar mechanics.			"

												This game reminds me of those old days when you'd have just a handful of games in your PC and you would play them over and over again, not because you liked them, but because you had no other games. I remember mastering this game when I was a very young kid. It was an awesome game experience. Playing this now as an old man just proves how easy (or scared of being too hard) modern games became.

Short version: 87%Commandos is one of the greatest classics of squad-based tactical combat games, where you command a group of elite soldiers through twenty maps of sabotage in semi-realistic World War II scenarios. The map and control design were so well made that this game still shines as bright as it did in 1998.Long version:Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines combines isometric tactical combat with real-time strategy and stealth. This mixture works so perfectly that it is still remembered by many to this date not just as a beloved childhood game, but as something revolutionary.And Commandos achieved this without any real plot. All twenty maps are more or less based on real WWII events, but they don’t have much story other than a historical introduction piece and a short mission briefing. No underlying plot, no character drama, just meticulously designed levels with several objectives.Achieving these goals usually requires careful planning, lots of sneaking around, and diversion tactics. Enemy guards are placed in strategic ways, and getting discovered or leaving a body in the open results in an alarm, which usually leads to mission failure.To finish the task, the player gets control over six commandos, all with distinct, unique abilities. Sadly, all but two of them are useless for almost anything apart from one certain task (driving the getaway car, rowing the boat, and so on), since only they can move dead bodies out of the way – something that is crucial on all levels. All the others usually just camp in one safe corner of the map, unused for most of the mission.The game was well-received and spawned an entire franchise, which in retrospect made Behind Enemy Lines the one with the shortest and easiest levels, but also with the biggest variety. It’s not as difficult as Beyond the Call of Duty, as complex as Men of Courage, or as action-oriented as Destination: Berlin, but still retains most of its old charm.			"

For those interested in strategy, achieving objectives and killing every last enemy on the map just for the fun of it; highly recommended! Its a true classic!The graphics arent' that great anymore but still is immersive enough in my opinion. No bugs or issues to report.			"

												My playing hours at Steam are still low, but don't be fooled. I played this game like a madman when i was a kid. Now bought all the three of them to my Steam.I haven't encountered any game-breaking bugs, or bugs at all actually. Everything plays smoothly on Windows 10. Now on to the game itself: It's hard. In order to get stars on the level evaluation, you have to pretty much order around the guys at the same time. In most levels i've had my Green beret running knifing people, while ordering my sniper to shoot other guys somewhere else. Quick keys are a bit strange, but you get used to them, since you're using them a lot!The game is old, max resulution isn't big (1240x720) so your  bit blurry, green camouflage guys sometimes get lost from you sadly, not from the enemy troops. I had a moment in one level where i accidentally noticed one of my guys casually standing at the shoreline, and enemy boat closing in. The levels itself are pretty diverse, and detailed, many ways to complete a level and there's no time limit if you dont want to reach for the stars. Sometimes it's fun just to play it again to try different tactics. You can't choose a previously completed level, but you get a password after each level so be sure to write them down if you want to skip to some level.It's a great and challenging squad strategy. If you enjoy a hard games that require thinking of proper use of tactics, buy this. ----Edited the resolution since i remembered it wrong, and corrected a typo---			"

I would love to have this problem fixed because i love this game more than any other pc game, but i cannot buy a disk version that will work in my laptop.  SAVING is the most important part of Commandos, this download needs to be fixed in order for it to be playable.			"

When I first played it, I was nearly seven year old, and all I can pass is level 4, my dad could beat level 10, and my consin could beat level 20.Looks like it is the time I have to beat all the levels myself, without using cheats of course.Thank you for the continues support, developers, and thank you for providing such great game.

												Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines is a great game. I bought it on a sale because it brought back some childhood memories but turns out that it is still better than majority of rts games out there. This is not your normal rts game where you make an army and go for the opposing force's base, instead you get the command of a few army specialists (depends on what mission you are playing) and are given certain tasks to complete, like blow up a train, kill the general etc. Some people might find the game hard as you cannot just mindlessly kill everyone on the map, it is all about planning your moves and staying hidden from the enemy. One mistake and you might fail the mission as you have to keep all your commandos alive, which is not too frustrating as the save/load functions work wonderfully.Overall I would reccommend this game to everyone who is into rts and stealth genere games and is okay with the outdated visuals.

												Strange to think that this game was published 19 years ago...When i found that Commandos Collection is on steam i decided to buy it, before that i had finished all episodes with cracked versions :D At least 3-4x times.Why i think you should play this  19 year old game in year 2017.- Awesome missions build up- Great extras and also interesting facts about WW II-  I also like that in some missons you have a option do it almost silently (avoiding alarm going off)- Well constructed levels, in some missons you really have to think where you can get the stuff needed to finish the mission (bombs, barrels, boats etc...)So as i said again its year 2017 and i would still rate this 3-D game 9/10, like really if you love playing startregy games than Commandos 1,2,3 are must be games to be finished by you.Now if you excuse me i will go and enjoy finishing this game again :D			"

												Ever since i was a little kid i was in love with this game even though i had no idea what i was doing back then.The concept of the ""one man army"" was always one of my favourites especially when they are human just like any other avarage guy . In this game it just shows that with the right strategy and moves human soldiers can look like superheroes and act like spikes in the coffin of the nazis during WW2 and this game represents everything awesome. I would recommand anyone who hasn't played this to experience a real gem in the first of commandos games that become epic with what they give to the player and how much they demand on our side as gamers to put in time to enjoy it :) Also started a stream not long ago and the commandos series are the first games I'm going try and beat .

												I primarily bought this game for the heavily nostalgic feelings I've been carrying around, and to try to relive the good old ""Commandos experience"". Out of the box, the game refused to run past the first loading video on my Windows 7 machine. After reading a lot of discussion threads and browsing through various forums, I came across a package called the ""ultimate_fix"", that would supposedly fix speed, sound and various other issues related to running the game on modern computers. Replacing the default files with the new files in the package made the game actually start up, but without any sound. There are no more workarounds that are known to work, and eventhough I totally loved this game, I cannot genuinely recommend it since there is no guarantee that it would properly run on today's computers.Tldr; Get it if you like the idea of having this legendary game in your library. The only thing running afterwards will be you, for patches.			"

Even if you dont know the game, the first missions are rather easy so you can get used to the gameplay as it's a bit different to todays strategic games.Later you will be overwhelmed at the beginning (so many guards, ""impossible to get throught"",...) but once you try out some tactics you will be rewarded. The feeling (even for killing THAT nasty single guard) is great! As every character has some specials, there are often various working approaches. Only at some points you have only a single useable tactic, but in my opinion this is not very annoying.Also, as this is an old game, you can Quicksave/Load, this helps alot as many things in this game require excellent timing. So, if you miss this little timeslot, just try it again. There are some negativ points ofc, still it's up to everyone how they weight the impact... The points with only one approach I already mentioned, another thing is the rating. It's based alot on the time you need for a mission, this can also be interesting for some people, but still i didn't like it that much (for the full rating you need to be VERY fast on some missions...). Also some missions seem overwhelming, there is no hint how to start. So for new players or people who dont like to think alot before starting, this is maybe a downside. For me personally this as not a problem, also i didnt notice more negativ points (for me).Non-Game issiueThere is one thing not really related to the game itself. After the install its not playable. You need to apply the speed-fix at least, some other, more individuall problems could also occor. I found all the things for fixing with a quick search and a look in the forums, still this game should be playable right after install imho. As I saw this in another review: SAVING IS POSSIBLE, if not you have not the right fixess ;)RatingBecause the Steaminstaller is so bad:8/10The game itself:9/10			"

												What a great game!  I remember playing this when I was younger.  I flipped through the games under $5 section during the summer sale and stumbled upon this piece of nostalgia.  Probably not for the average gamer, but right up my alley.  It did require a fix before playing, but it was simple and quick.  If you like a good challenge to think through I highly recommend it.  It was only $.79 during the sale!  I purchased the whole package for $2.69, and plan on wasting many fun filled hours of my life on it.			"

												A legendary game. I'm not usually the kind of person to pick up a game I played 5+ years ago and play it through again with much enthusiasm, but this game is one of the exceptions. It had been over 15 years since I originally played this game yet I was very excited to start playing Commandos: BEL again. And it managed to keep my motivation up from the beginning until the very end. It's a great mix of stealth/tactics/suspense with some action. The controls still felt good (remembered a lot of the hotkeys too!) And I like that it's not too short and easy as many games of the same type nowadays tend to be, the difficulty and length are just right. I even still loved the graphics (something that I can't usually say about old games).The only minor negative thing that comes to mind is that you can't enter the last mission unless you got good enough ranks from the other missions. As I liked to take my sweet time to indulge myself in nostalgia and often planned the missions perfectly, I didn't manage to get the ranks needed to enter the last mission. And as much as I loved playing the game, I wouldn't have had the motivation to start playing through the missions again, so it's good that there's a cheat code for entering the last mission. Minor issue, otherwise the game is 10/10 in my books. Get it when it's dirty cheap on sale with the other Commandos games.			"

A real-time tactics game consisting of 20 missions with a lot of wonks and bonks in design but overall satisfying to play.You use a team of commandos, numbers vary by mission, to perform assigned objectives then exit the area. It's relatively like a puzzle game where you'll have to time certain tasks right and use an appropriate commando in an appropriate situation. For the most part you'll be using one commando more than the rest however everyone does play a vital role and in order to finish a mission as ""cleanly"" as possible everyone will be required to fulfill their roles in each mission.A real cool feature this game has is the ability to have multiple (I think a maximum of 8 total) windows in the game and a function that lets the camera for the selected window to follow an enemy or commando.The game requires quite a bit of thinking and even though you've got the enemy's movements down and you know your way around you'll still need a lot of patience to get through a mission without causing too much or no fuss. Each mission also gets much, much lengthier as you progress (after I think mission 15/20 it takes me around 3 or more hours to complete).It will be very helpful to learn the shortcut keys for each commando (as opposed to always clicking on their items) for better convenience and quicker actions in given situations. Unfortunately the keys are un-rebindable so memorizing the keys may be a bit more of a hassle.The AI, whether the Nazis or your commandos, can be pretty dumb. The commandos will have a habit of spazzing out or maybe taking some weird extra 2-foot diagonal path or whatever when maybe all you wanted them to do is walk along the wall whilst hugging it and turn on the next corner while still hugging said wall. The Nazis, especially the ones in groups, may glitch up a bit when making a turn on their paths meaning their field of visions have a good chance of going all over the place.With an isometric game like this I figured you should at least be able to see or go ""behind"" large structures especially since the enemy can do it, but you can't. If you click on a building thinking you'll go ""behind"" it then the assigned commando will most likely try to find the fastest route ""in front"" of it. It's also a pain every now and again to try and put one commando where another is specifically located because there's no option to click through your guys so you may accidentally click on your guy instead of moving one there.Really it's a cool game and despite all its design flaws it feels good to get through a really tough and lengthy mission.

												It's nice to be able to revisit this game after so many years. Back then it was a challenge and it's wonderful to stay it's still kept that challenge. There have been several instances where I've genuinely had to check external sources to find out ways to do certain things, however, not all of these are for lack of not knowing what to do because the challenge is great, but because not everything is explained well.For every element that makes the game great, there are some aspects I'm reminded of that irritate the hell out of me. 1) Driving anything is awful, everything handles like a brick covered in superglue and the clicking to move places can be frustrating when the vehicles find it so easy to get stuck. 2) Inconsistancies between distances you are able to reach with weaponry and enemies are able to reach (depending on whether you are high or low) can be annoying. 3) AI is dumb. Nothing is more annoying than failing a mission because the character you are trying to move to a select position gets stuck on an invisible wall thus getting seen, has to go right around the earth to get through a doorway running right into the line of sight or wastes time dillydallying when you asked them to do something.So many annoying bugs and gameplay issues that would be called out....if the game were released today. Given that this is an old game and besides all those issues, holds up, is still enjoyable and highly addictive, I recommend revisiting it. Then once you are done, play some more here: https://sites.google.com/site/strikeinnarrowpath/ where you can find 9 modded extra missions for your joy.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Strategy Stealth world war 2  game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere are some Resolution sizes.The sound volume has a slidebar.There is a manual/introduction in the game.There is a tutorial in the game. (for Each commando and basic)Multiplayer requires IP and Port Forwarding. THIS STILL WORKS!About the game.You play with a couple of commandos and each commando has their own equipment and skills. The game is very difficult by itself and their is even a difficulty level settings too. Just if it is too easy. There are 20 mission/Maps and You have to complete each mission by fulfilling the subjective. Destroying things, to freeing, capturing and so go on. Enemy soldiers/vehicles has an eye of sight which is marked with Dark green and light green. Dark green means you have to crouch or otherwise the enemy unit will see you. Light green he spotted you and could fire on you. Your commandos are able to take hostage by enemy Sergeants (usually patrolling with units). There is a chance that they will rise alarm if they see you, if that happends. You might load game. Because things will get 10x harder if they have raised their alarm. Whenever a mission starts you will be told what you have to do and you get some hints too.Announcer that is giving you some tips and hints and what you need to do in order to complete the mission.Music is good.It has some old graphics but it's fine to be honest.Enemies could be difficult to see sometimes due the graphical background.You have a map on the right side and a hint next to the map.Alot of Error and trials.Multiple save slots. Which are needed!Each commando has their own Voice.Pathing is sometimes weird.Animations are sometimes slow.Other things.I have played this game, back in the childhood. I was a total nooby back then. Stuck on Mission 4 for like forever and eventually quitted. Now i got the game again and i have managed to beat every level and complete the game.I have enjoyed it very much, some missions are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ but there are no mission the same. Sometimes a little bit of luck is required too.-------------------I Give this game a 8/10			"

												This game is a  blast! I'm very glad to see it on steam. This game requires more patience than I had when i played it 15 years ago.  My tips are: read the F1 help menu in game and learn the keyboard shortcuts/commands. My other tip is, make sure you use multiple saves!  This game makes you feel like a boss everytime you beat a level. The only thing it stuffers from is a slightly outdated ui. It would be nice for the game to display the keyboard commands on the game screen rather than in an F1 menu. The amount of keyboard shortcuts is out of the realm of fast memorization. I actually took a pad of paper and just wrote down the keyboard shortcuts. This is only a problem because as a digital download you dont have the benefit of a nice printed user manual in front of you; something that this game originaly came with. Other than that this game is a must play for any methodical/stealth RTS fans.Works great on my win7 pc.			"

												Yes, it hasn’t aged as well as it could have, but I think for those nostalgic people like me it is still quite playable and definitely a good challenge. To be honest, I don’t think I ever made it past the first few missions as a kid, but I’m happy I managed to beat the whole game now (even if it took 28 hours to do so). And I have also confirmed something that hasn’t changed since I first played Commandos and that is: “I really suck at this”. Definitely a game for those that like challenges, but I’d recommend it mostly if it’s not your first time playing Commandos. Save often, save in different slots and use all your commandos wisely (although the Green Beret does most of the job, 99% of the time) And yeah, I had a few technical issues, but not anything a reload wouldn't fix.

												I'm pretty sure I spent all of Christmas Day 1998 playing Commandos. It came in one of those big cardboard boxes that PC games used to come in.As a kid, I must have watched every WW2 movie from the 1950s and 60s dozens of times, renting them from Blockbuster on VHS tape. Commandos allowed me to participate in a Dirty Dozen style behind-the-lines adventure.My engineering mind loved the puzzle of using different soldiers equipped with unique talents and tools, and figuring out the order and timing of employing those soldiers, to achieve the mission and avoid detection.As an adult gamer, Commandos is still challenging as hell! But it's also fun as hell and very accessible for a modern gamer.			"

												I picked this game up mostly for nostalgia reasons (I mean, I won it in a giveaway but I entered it because of nostalgia) - And it gave me exactly what I wanted. It is a classic, and should be treated as such. What I'm saying is - I do recommend this game, but only if you've played it when it first came out, or if you like old games and have no problem with outdated mechanics, graphics and controls.Some goods and bads about the game:+ Fun and challenging stealth gameplay+ Each level is different, and new ideas and mechanics constantly come into play+ Graphics, while very outdated, still look pretty good.+ Killing Nazis is always fun~ Controls are often unintuitive, but manageable when you get used to the hotkeys- The Green Beret and the Spy are the only consistantly useful squad mates.

												I picked this game up mostly for nostalgia reasons (I mean, I won it in a giveaway but I entered it because of nostalgia) - And it gave me exactly what I wanted. It is a classic, and should be treated as such. What I'm saying is - I do recommend this game, but only if you've played it when it first came out, or if you like old games and have no problem with outdated mechanics, graphics and controls.Some goods and bads about the game:+ Fun and challenging stealth gameplay+ Each level is different, and new ideas and mechanics constantly come into play+ Graphics, while very outdated, still look pretty good.+ Killing Nazis is always fun~ Controls are often unintuitive, but manageable when you get used to the hotkeys- The Green Beret and the Spy are the only consistantly useful squad mates. The rest are situational, and often completely useless- Vehicles are a nightmare to control- Max resolution is 1280x720. Also, some of the tutorials are too small for the screen even in that resolution which causes a weird visual bug- AI is sometimes laughably stupidTo summarize, if you have fond memories of this game - It will live up to what you remember.

												I'm pretty sure I spent all of Christmas Day 1998 playing Commandos. It came in one of those big cardboard boxes that PC games used to come in.As a kid, I must have watched every WW2 movie from the 1950s and 60s dozens of times, renting them from Blockbuster on VHS tape. Commandos allowed me to participate in a Dirty Dozen style behind-the-lines adventure.My engineering mind loved the puzzle of using different soldiers equipped with unique talents and tools, and figuring out the order and timing of employing those soldiers, to achieve the mission and avoid detection.As an adult gamer, Commandos is still challenging as hell! But it's also fun as hell and very accessible for a modern gamer.			"

												I originally played this game in what seemed like a different life; back in 1998 when it came out. I remember spending countless hours playing this game, and I remember it being incredibly difficult but loads of fun. It is very reminiscent of other strategy games of the mid-late nineties, but set in World War II. You command a group of commandos, all with different skills and abilities. Each stage has different line-ups of soldiers and usually a different inventory. The spy can disguise himself as a Nazi captain, the Marine can dive underwater and commandeer an inflatable raft, the driver can control tanks, the sapper can place bombs and traps, etc. Some characters run faster, and only some characters can heal. I will say, if you are looking for an easy play through and/or get easily frustrated, this game is NOT for you. It is very challenging and you die almost immediately if you are caught. You will find yourself constantly saving and loading, and I found it not uncommon to save/load around fifty times a map. It is stealth based and you will die if you go in guns blazing. Don't let this discourage you though, since it's a very fun game and gave me countless hours of entertainment. When I bought this game here on Steam it was something stupid-cheap like 75 cents. Even if you only play a map or two, you get your money's worth to at least give it a try. It is of course heavily dated (I almost laughed when I saw the system requirements), but the value and fun is there. Give it a shot, you won't regret it.			"

												This game is as good as I remember BUT (and it's a big but) I find that the double click command (which makes your soldiers run) is so temperamental as to get you killed. Over, and over, and over... Better than 90% of my deaths come from this control interface issue. Which would be fine, except this first game in the series won't allow me to save in-mission. So, you either do the whole mission start to finish, without getting your lads killed, or you stroll over to an enemy soldier that you meant to sprint for, and you're doomed. The levels have passwords instead of save game files. It's blood boilingly awful. Still, the game is worth getting and it's worth persevering with. Just be prepared to needlessly start each and every level possibly dozens of times over because you double clicked and the user interface didn't register it. (If the mouse moves AT ALL between the first and second clicks, the game reads it as two single clicks, and your soldier walks to his objective with no sense of urgency.) In short - get it, it's good enough to rise above the frankly terrible controls, but yes, be prepared for tears of frustration.			"

You'll need an unofficial patch to play this game on a new age computer as the game runs too fast otherwise. Finding said patch is quite the challange although if you look carefully everything you'll need is linked via the Steam forums.Still have a windows 95/98 kicking around? I'd suggest using that computer to play this game. Regardless, the game's a jem.			"

												Old school game that is difficult to enjoy unless you played it when it originally came out.  The game offers a huge campaign that will take you many hours, as this game is very difficult.  You control different commandos with varying skills and equipment.  You must complete your goals.  While the premise is simple, the limited health and ability to survive once you are spotted makes this game a true stealth game.  By moving multiple commandos all in real time, this adds even more difficulty.  The game is well done, however, it lacks the features that could easily be found in today's games of a similar type of genre.  I recommend it because I find it was well done and still plays well, however, if you're not into a difficult stealth game, then this just isn't for you.  The graphics still work by today's standards and the sound is and vocals from your commando still work well during gameplay.			"

												I do not know if this game was unique in its concept at the time, but it's must certainly one of the few puzzle strategy games out there. I've not seen many like it. Only the Desperado games, set in the Wild West, as far as I know.Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines follows bunch of special missions in WWII where you as an officer use the skills of a couple specialised commandos, specially trained British soldiers. Each commando has his own set of tools to help you to complete each mission. And it's up to you to decide when and how to utilise each commando to overcome certain obstacles. If any of your commandos dies, you'll fail the mission. You'll have to pay attention not to alert any of the German soldiers or officers, as they're always alert and on the lookout. They watch and listen to anything suspicious. Some garrison buildings with the swastika flying will contain soldiers that will come out and patrol when the alarm is sounded. This will make your missions far more difficult, so stealth is key. Each new mission is an ever bigger puzzle you have to try to complete. You have 20 to complete.The game has, despite being from 1998 and sometimes in need of workarounds to get it working properly, a great atmosphere, supported by actual WWII film footage and little background stories, and a unique aesthetic.

												This game runs too fast on modern hardware.  I can only find old outdated posts on the Steam forums by users that made fixes, but all the sharing site links are down and no longer working.  THE GAME DOES NOT WORK STOCK ON STEAM.  How they get away with reselling this garbage that plain doesn't work is beyond me.  I've also read that these versions are 1.0, not even patched to the latest versions.Once you get it working, if you do, the controls are god awful.  You have to literally memorize 10 different hotkeys for each soldier.  Unlike most RTS games, where if you click an attack on an enemy, your unit will close into range and attack.  Not here.  In this crappy game they stand there like idiots until you tell them to move with a hotkey, and then tell them to attack with another hotkey.  By then they're dead.  I don't care if it's an old game.  I recall getting a demo on an old PC Gamer disc, and there were tons of RTS games like Command & Conquer out by then.  Whomever designed the UI in this game needs to be shot.  This game was originally released in 1998, so there's no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ excuse for this.  There is waaaaay too much micro management here for an RTS to where you were wishing it was either turn-based, or the controls were consolidated enough to where your unit weren't so worthless.I guess after I fixed the speed as well as the saved games not working I now get to try to find something that will bind custom hotkeys.  Do not waste your dollar on this garbage because the time spent to get it all working will cost you more in the end.			"

												What a disappointment. I bought this game expecting to have alot of fun. Instead I get this unplayable buggy mess of a game. For starters, the game runs WAY too fast on modern PCs.  It is impossible to react to anything since everything moves to damn fast.  Stealth is a must when you play this game, but since everything is in super speed, you won't be able to time it correctly when trying to avoid the enemies line of sight. If you are seen, they will kill you in the blink of a eye and all you can do is just start up a new game since you cannot even save or load your game! This game is one of those games where saving and loading on the fly is very important, but there is no way to do that for some unknown reason. What is even worse is that Steam is actually selling this game online without fixing it. Yea, it was not that expensive, but someone is still making a pretty penny off of this games sales. It is sad because this game is actually good, it's just these bugs that prevent it from being playable. The least they could do is patch it up or if all else fails, take it down the store. If the glitches were fixed, I would definitely recomend buying it.			"

												I love strategy games, but I found the speed of the game way too fast for the select and click system. So I start learning the hot keys and put them to use. However, I got fed up with the constant going behind an enemy, planning to use my gun, and after telling my man to fire, him and the nazi soldier would just stand there looking at each other. Moving in any direction would result in my man dying, unable to shoot due to the environment getting in the way.			"

												I adore this game, like most I played it in my younger years and was thrilled to see it on Steam and that my nostalgia wasn't blinding me to how good the game actually is.Don't get me wrong, it's far from perfect, but if you like strategy and rewarding game play, get it, NOW!Gripes: There are several issues I have so far, but these are completely personal and may not make any sense to you but I will list them here.1. Enemy detection: When an enemy detects a dead body they will run towards it and depending on where they are, sound an alarm or not. The problem with isolated soldiers is that they will, after a short while, just return to their normal patrol route walking past the dead body and not changing their behaviour.2. Noise detection: Gun shots have a noise detection range of (what appears to be) 1 meter, its REALLY short to the point it's a little bit cheaty, but worse than that.... Running has no negative effect, they do not hear you at all which was a let down when I found that out, thankfully, its fixed in Commandos 2 :).Other than these, brilliant game, and one of the most satisfying experiences I have had in a long time completing a level.

												This game actually sucks pls don't buy it save your money for like actual games, I mean like REAL games and when I say real I MEAN real. E.T. is better than this game and that's saying a lot. You know what actually E.T. isn't that bad of a game because it's got some decent gameplay aspects it's just that the game doesn't tell you what to do so it's like what's the point of playing it. If there were proper instructions, it'd be a much better game. It's just critized because it was expected to be a better game at launch and it caused a lot of people to flip but that's okay because we all look back on that now and say ""hey that was funny"". So playing E.T. now and knowing what to do, it's actually a pretty good game and overall I'd give it a 7.5/10.But ""Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines"" gets a 0/10 pls don't play.			"

												Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines is absolutely brilliant for a game made in 1998, its jammed pack with strategic depth while still maintains a reasonable difficulty level. In Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines, instead of controlling massive armies, you control six specialized units. The map is designed in such a way that makes all your units have synergy with each other. While you can win early games with very little use of decoys, stealing, and stealth, the end game requires your mastery of all your units’ abilities. This game is as perfect a strategy game as chess. Like chess you see the battlefield with no fog of war, there is no resource management, and none of the numerical/economic factors that limit the pure strategy/tactics of the game. The only fault I can even find on Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines is its severe lack of sound, voice, and ambience.			"

												This game has problems on modern computers but all is fixable if you look in the forums.To those who don't know what is commandos: The most hardcore game ever came out (only the first one, rest are easier) This game makes you to predict everything before doing it it needs fast reaction + plan + stealth + baiting. There is no flaw in this game and i heavily recommend it to those who can be hardcore players and have brains.  this is no game for people who think they can finish a mission at ease and fast. you either finish it in 10 minutes or 10 hours it all depends on what you do and what happens next in game.

Its not that the game runs in a faster speed than it was intended; I could even handle that since waiting for partols run around is annoying. But there's a lot of cinematics, tutorials and windows missing. You load a mission and you won't even know what you're supposed to do.

												I love that this game is real-time ""tactics"" and not strategy. It's got the feel of a strategy game without the complexity of micro-management. The variety of different tactics that you can use on each map make this game feel incredibly deep and well thought out. Despite its age, the game play is highly enjoyable and fans of 2D isometric maps will find that the landscapes and units are still well detailed and crisp, even at the low resolutions the game offers.

												The Commando series are not what we typically think of as a strategy game today.  They are part of an older action genre that luckily died out in favor of better RTS games.  Basically in Commandos there is only one way to perform the mission and you have to look around and do a lot of trial and error, read that as dying over and over again, to try different things at various times in order to progress.  I was looking for something along the lines of Rush To Berlin or something similar and this is a far cry from that masterpiece.  Unless you enjoy frustration or have unending patience, I would not reccommend the Commando series for someone looking for a ""real"" strategy game.			"

Icons are too small to select and the trigger spot always hard to find.  Double click means runing, but if you double-click in wrong speed you will come out from shelter and stroll infront all your enemnies. Any wrong step will kill you instantly and you will restart from the begin. And after you finally assassinated your target you CANNOT pick up the body because the icon is too tiny to hit.WTF. And you will experience countless looses like this espically while you are using a cheap mouse.So dont buy it or you have a really precise mouse. Donot ruin your good memoraries by play it again.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												This game works very well on windows 8. Now, it does take a while to get used to and I am not even used to it myself. It is very simple but you need to use tacticts and careful strategy in order to cause a minimal damage and spotting as possible. I reccomend this highly for those who use windows 8, but if you are not, I am not sure because I am seeing alot of bad reviews for the game on windows 7/xp			"

												Old school strategy game from the 90's, Commandos is played like a real-time chess game on a WW2 diorama. A small number of specialized soldiers at your orders, too many enemies to overcome, impossible missions....this sums it up pretty good. Every move you make must be planned ahead, sometimes four/five moves ahead, enemies' IA is unforgiving, graphics are outdated and the old and clunky interface will make you rage too often, but when it came out in 1998 this was an instant classic, and it was nice to play it again after so many years!To newcomers to the series I would suggest to start from Commandos 2, that was a real gem, refined in every aspect, but if you like hard challenges, also for your patience and nerves, go ahead and dive in this first chapter's 20 missions; afterwards, if you still have energies, it could be fun to try the expansion pack, ""Beyond the Call of Duty""! Good luck ;)			"

												I'm old fan of these games so I bought this game on discount as a part of whole collection for 2,50. blahblahI'm personally running windows 8 on a decent HW and to be honest, when I turned the game on for the first time everything went insanely fast (5x?) and save feature was disabled. Other than that I didn't notice any problems and even managed to find a working fix for these 2 issues (worked aswell for my friend). Now I'm playing it MP with my friend, the only drawback of multiplayer would be the desync (one player sees something that didn't actually happen) that occurs every once in a while but it's not something unbearable, load usually fixes it. It's an old game and let's be straightforward about it lads 1998 and 2014 is quite a jump in gaming industry.All I can say to finish this review would be that I'm content with it even if I needed to mess around with fix for a few extra minutes. The game overall is worth it, good old classic tactical RTS. So don't hold back when you want to buy this lil game!USEFUL LINKS:http://commandos.wikia.com/wiki/Fixing_Commandos

												I've never before played and of the Commandos games. This one seems quite nice despite how old it is. It is a VERY hard game (well to me since I haven't much experience with games of the sort) and mixes strategy as well as action. You command a group of elite troops, executing various missions against the Nazi 3rd Reich.***Word of Warning***In order to run the game on Windows 10 x64, I had to rename the .exe file into Commandoz.exe and run it straight from the the folder ~NOT through Steam~.

												Great game - it's a great moment when you pull off a well time kill having spent the last 10 minutes trying work out where the enemy's blind spot is! Obviously the graphics look dated these days, but the game is 17 years old so you can't really fault it for that. You are punished heavily for making a mistake so it's not for the really casual type player, but for someone who wants to get into a game and enjoys planning kills out then this is right up there.It's just a shame that there are problems with Windows 10 and various people have issues with Windows 7 - if you look at the negative reviews you'll find that a lot of them relate to these, rather than the game itself. Give it a go and if it doesn't work then get a Steam refund, but it's well worth a try.			"

 A challenging strategic game where timing in your actions & leading your crew of commandos in the best ways is the focus point.Commandos is one of these games that I've seen a lot sitting on store shelves but never cared about, overlooking it thinking it was the same as C&C* or AoE* only realising now that it's a more in depth look in those genre of games. Literaly it's all focused on one platoon of specialized commados instead of a whole army. -Each of your crew members have their own abilities & using the right one at the right time is crucial. you will only have a specific set of commandos in each missions (except on the later ones where more/everyone is involved) which will limits your actions in different ways. -Each missions takes time, say between 15 to 30 minutes (or more) depending at how you visualize/complete them.-Stealth is primordial, everyone needs to come back alive. ""Remember, this is a sneaking mission."" -Getting mad, yelling, cursing is optionnal but will happen on it's own somehow...Overall, really surprised by how long it took me to complete it (50 hours), the replay-value is off the chart, the multiple ways of completing missions makes you go back, and so on. I absolutely recommend it, especially on sale & bundled with the sequels.*Command & Conquer.*Age of Empire. "

												A great RTS stealth game for the pc and it even has native widescreen support :D. I always liked this game, it's main draw are it's huge maps and the variety of people you get to play as. Who doesn't want to be in charge of a kickass spy, demolition guy, sniper and more at the same time? Be warned though: this game can be tough. I'd recommend picing up the collection if you can find it cheap, because the whole series kicks♥♥♥♥♥(except for that one FPS game that shall never be named...).Note: you need to apply some fixes to play the games proper on modern OS'es, you can find them on the steam forums.

												Commandos is yet another game, whose beauty lies in its crazy difficulty. While it is refered to as a ""strategy"", I would rather describe it as ""WW2-themed logical game / isometric view sneaker / (seldom) tight-timed action click-fest"".The men, you control are more rookies than experts. They are outnumbered, outgeared and underqualified. Only one of the commandos can use an assult rifle (at the distance of approx 20 in-game meters/yards). Their effective range of pistol shot is half that number. The enemies shoot accurately from further distances and can easily kill all of the squad within a few seconds. Only two of them are stong enough to carry dead bodies. If you can turn a dead eye to these dumb assumptions, you will get an extremely challenging and still fun game. The team must resort to stealth moves and silent kills, at least until they bring down enough enemies and neutralize their adantage of numbers. Most of the time the player must analyse the patrolling routes of enemy soliders and look for weak spots. Then plan and execute a quick action of taking the prey down without alerting remaining guards. This is the point, when precise clicking comes into play. The game sometimes leaves no more then a few seconds to get nearby unnoticed, point a solider, kill him (click), grab his corpse (click), move to safe place (point and click) before another guy turns around and sees you over the body of his fellow. He usually does so. Then you need to improve the plan, create extra diversion or just wait for a better timing. There is a lot of loading after failed attempts. The game allows to quick save and quick load with ctrl+S / ctrl+L respectively. Use them a lot and always have a backup save at the beginning of the mission. There is no auto-save of the career progress. Past the fifth mission the game becomes quite difficult, the missions are large, enemies numerous and they observation areas overlap a lot. The game consists of 20 regular missions and six short trainings. The playtime per mission is approximately 1h past mission 1, 2-3h in mid game and 3-4h at the end. The game also offers a score of the mission depending on the time and damage taken, but I didn't personally feel compelled to master every single level.Technical:* The game runs in the maximum resolution of 1024 x 768, which is rather poor now,* there is no ingame music during the missions (that's not a bug)* I noticed sound issues during the debriefing (that is a bug),* The game sometimes asks you to insert a game cd into the drive. Chosing a random option ""retry"" or ""cancel"" should let you through, but I would rather see it fixed,Conclusion:* Commandos are beyond straightforward classification* high difficulty level, lots of save+loads, * very challanging and rewarding, but can also be frustrating for impatient players* a bit outdated graphics, unsuited for contemporary displays* poor and annoying sounds, can be muded* at least 40 hours to beat* minor porting issues* no achievivments, medicore replayablityDo not play, if you* do not like hybrids* do not like to die / reload* do not like to get stuck for 15 minutes wandring how to kill that guy, only to see twenty more soliders to hunt down Do play if, you* love to hunt for a weak spots* prefer silent killing to gun-blazing* experiment, plan, try, fail, improve, execute, succeed* don't mind outdated graphics and sound			"

												Easily one of the best WWII action/tactical games ever made. Distract German soldiers with a decoy, sneak up behind them, take them out silently with your knife/harpoon gun, drag their body behind a rock, steal a general's uniform, infiltrate their base, plant explosives, steal a tank, extract prisoners, blow everything up... then run like hell.8/10			"

												This game was great when it was new and I spent long hours getting caught and shot on sight by nazis. But it was worth it to feel the thrill of sneaking behind a guard with clockwork precision.Now, it feels a bit old. Maybe because the puzzles are pretty straightforward so once you know how to solve them there is not much challenge or replayability.Characters are not that well balanced, you can do almost anything just using the green beret so everyone else has a specific purpose on the mission and little more use.

												I don't think I like Commandos: BEL just for nostalgia's sake. This is truly a great game.One unique thing about the game is that even while the missions often times feel impossible at first, there are actually a near-endless number of ways to complete them. Whenever I watch videos of another player completing a mission, I pretty much always find them doing things I never thought of doing.And when you consider how much time and effort will regularly go into completing a single mission, it's pretty amazing that there are 20 of them, not to mention the stand-alone expansion (Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty).

												I remember when I played for the first time in July 1998. It's one of those games that you have left to finish it the feel of a great enjoyment at a time of great sorrow for having done. Now the games are extremely easy and short. Commandos is a game with a HIGH level of difficulty for average players. The difficulty lies in having to observe the conditions of the mission (ground, guards, patrols) before acting i do not like crazy, but sometimes also boldness is rewarded. You must learn to use your resources and usually find several possible ways of dealing with each assignment.After playing it again, you realize it has lost none of the gameplay that characterized and has aged surprisingly well. The level of difficulty of the missions is perfectly structured, from a first mission is essentially a tutorial to the last this goes up gradually without big jumps. This increase is offset by the acquired skill in handling the characters through the game.The weakest aspects of the game are in the low use of some of the characters to be very limited by their roles, being used on a mission only in a particular action, but having to take in all the action while avoiding being killed.Undoubtedly the worst of the game is in multiplayer. Played in cooperative mode, having to wait for each player to the other end their movement. You also can not use the same character for more than one player, resulting in a frustrating gaming experience.In short: Commandos is an excellent game that will satisfy the discerning player who does not like the easy challenges. Its gameplay is single player, multiplayer being their weak point.			"

												Probably the most strategic (small-scale tactics) RTS game I've ever played.  You must really plan your moves before executing as your entire team must survive to complete a mission.  Every team member having different skills and only one common skill (pistol) makes for a very challenging tactical dynamic that forces you to adapt to your environment.  If one of your team can't be brought to an area where he would be useful, you'll need to come up with a new plan.  Timing and synchronization also come in handy here.This was one of the first games I played in my life and really shaped the way I see problems.			"

												It's a stealthy RTS. You don't build buildings and create units, but you command a specialized group of commandos on infiltration and sabotage missions. Each commando is a unique character that has a specialty (marine, sapper, sniper, spy, driver, etc.) There's also multiplayer. Steep learning curve, and can be unforgiving, but is quite fun in the long run. [NOTE: It runs TOO FAST on modern machines, but there is a fix!

												The single most frustrating game I have every played. It demands an extremely high level of precision and timing but the mechanics and controls are not simply not up to the challenge. No game should require that you learn every element from trial and error, nor should saving after every single move be essential to getting through levels. Do not play this game if you take blood pressure medication.This being said it is one of those games that is challenging enough that you will be drawn back to try   again because the final satisfaction of beating a level is quite rewarding.

												I have Windows 10 and it runs fine. I believe the devs released patches to make sure it works. So far it's really challenging and fun. You must use each commando to their approriate use to overcome seemingly impossible odds. I'll write a full review once I've beaten the game. But paying $0.79  or $2.59 for a bundle that includes four games (this one, Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty ~ I guess it's like DLC before there was DLC ~, Commandos 2: Men of Courage and Commandos 3: Destination Berlin) that still hold up by today's standards is a great price. Especially for you people who are into games like Dark Souls, which punish every mistake, this will be a nice romp to see what good games were really like in the 90s.			"

												This game is indeed my childhood mate and I kinda grew up with it(Among various other titles)If you look at the date when the game was pubished, you'll reach the conclusion that there was a lot of work done to it.The level desigs are just amazing and the whole game is unique in all aspects...The most crucial element in this game is simply PATIENCE, PATIENCE and PATIENCE			"

												Commandos is a good strategy game where you control a small squad of soldiers. It reminds Jagged Alliance 2 but works in real time, and you can't issue orders in pause. Usually you need to come to enemies from behind, learn their patrol routes, and track their fields of view which the game shows as green cones. The graphics were great for the time and have aged well. The sounds and the music are good. If you like a challenge than this game if for you. It's get's extremely hard fast. Too the point it can become frustrating, but you don't find that in game today, so I appreciate the challenge.			"

												I don't think I like Commandos: BEL just for nostalgia's sake. This is truly a great game.One unique thing about the game is that even while the missions often times feel impossible at first, there are actually a near-endless number of ways to complete them. Whenever I watch videos of another player completing a mission, I pretty much always find them doing things I never thought of doing.And when you consider how much time and effort will regularly go into completing a single mission, it's pretty amazing that there are 20 of them, not to mention the stand-alone expansion (Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty).

												A great game if you like strategy and stealth.This is a tactical strategy game, where you control a team of special units with unique skills and a pistol, however in a lot of the missions you are very likely to lose if the alarm starts before you have everything ready, so a lot of trial and error, patience and AI exploits are required. A tactical puzzle would be a more fitting description.Most of the missions have you blow up one or more buildings, rescue prisoners or kill a target and escape. These are presented in the briefing, however sometimes the escape location or the secondary objectives are incorrect, and unless you check the ""corner minimap"" you will wonder why the mission does not end.A great game with meticulous planning if you have the patience for it.

												If one of your friends has ANY knowledge on how to port forward, this game is a MUST play on multiplayer. Engaging missions and an extremely small margin for error makes this game what it is. While the graphics may be lacking and the controls are tough to get used to, the gameplay is a very fun experience and successfully pulling off a tough mission is very rewarding. However, the game does get somewhat dificult at times, and very small mistakes can undo a good amount of work.7/10			"

												If you like games that are incredibly difficult, and really test your ability to be tactical, this is a game for you. Intense scenarios, hair-tearing moments, and utter satisfaction upon completing a mission, let alone the entire game. Of course, I'm biased considering I grew up with this game, but it's a fantastic purchase.			"

												Great game. Just don't bother buying if you're running w7 or newer. Worked fine for a day, could even play online for a couple of hours. Next day it wouldn't start at all, reinstalling the game, removing all savegames, restarting computer and even trying various fixes wouldn't fix the issue. Obviously it's late to get a refund at that point.Edit: The 18th of February 2016 patch did not fix the issues I'm having. The game still keeps crashing 2 seconds after launching it, for both me and my friend.Edit2: My friend found a fix online that works! In order to launch the game I need to rename ""GameOverlayRenderer.dll"", from Steam folder, to something else while playing Commandos. This allows me to launch the game as intended.I'm changing the recommendation to yes, since there's no ""hell yeah"".			"
