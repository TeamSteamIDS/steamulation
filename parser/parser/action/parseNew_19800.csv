												I finished this game 6 years ago on DVD version but i only paid for it on steam to be able to post a review because this game worths it.Gameplay Review = check my road to hill 30 review (both have same gameplay)http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arashenstein/recommended/15190/Story Review (No spoiler):first of all brothers in arms is something like metal gear solid and you should play them in order to understand the story otherwise you understand NOTHING at all about the game. watching on youtube + reading on wiki and things like that wont help you have to play it yourself to find out what is going on. the order is:1. Road to hill 302. Earned in blood3. Hell's highwaythere is no spoiler for you here but you need to know one thing about the story, brothers in arms starts like a normal world war II story, you play as a man called Matthew Baker the squad leader of 13 soldiers, 13 fathers, 13 sons, 13 families.... 13 is not a lucky number! in Road to hill 30 you start the game some where near france after parachuting from your shut down airplane and then after a few missions 2 of your squad members die mysteriously and then story focuses on this question ""how they died?"", there is another member in your team called Joseph Hartsock, the squad leader of the  2nd squad in road to hill 30, in the first BiA you do not see this squad you only hear about them and see them in cutscenes but there are in no missions. in fact they are in same mission area as you are but they are operating in differnet part of the map which you only hear about in cutscenes of road to hill 30.In Earned in blood you play as Joseph Hartsock the second squad leader and you play almost all missions from Road to hill 30 but in the eyes of Joseph Hartsock, he tells you a secret story of what really happened back in road to hill 30 however the question about how your two squad members died back in Road to hill 30 still remains unanswered. this question will be answered in Hell's Highway, and prepare some tissues because that game will make you cry and makes you extremely emotional.

												After having played trough Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30 and Earned in Blood I can say: These (3) games have a solid way of telling you what happened with the 101st Airborne squad. This game shows you the scenario's from Road to Hill 30 trough the eyes of Joe ""Red"" Hartsock. The game play is absolutely amazing and the immersion is phenomenal. The enemies and the objectives in Earned in Blood are slightly better and harder, I really recommend playing this game on ""normal"" or harder difficulty to really get the developer intended experience especially the tactical game play.If you have the time you should definitely play the games from the Brothers in Arms franchise. (9/10)PS: For people with field of view problems this is adjustable in the ""user.ini"" file located in the game directory.			"

												Earned in Blood, just like the other two Brothers in Arms games, has an amazing story.The three games combined are simply the greatest WWII games out there. Call of Duty 2, of course, was amazing for the African campaign. But Gearbox hold the title for recreating very important battles in the Normandy region in France. I mean, if you've played the games, then maybe you've seen the extras where pictures show how much detail they put into recreating the villages in Northern France. It's very remarkable.The story, you play as Joe Hartstock, Red, in this one. Maybe you remembered him in Road to Hill 30. Well, this game takes place alongside Road to Hill 30 as Joe is recounting his actions to SLAMarshall, a war documentarian, recording the actions of combat troops for the military. Throughout the story, Joe sees his friends get injured, change their attitude during the war, and some of them unfortunately die. But that's war. The audio design is unreal. My dad walked by when I was playing and noted how realistic the sounds were for the rifles and panzers. The soundtrack, too, is amazing. Basically, I'm biased as hell as I already love WWII anything, but the strong character development, friendship, and tactical elements make the Brothers in Arms games some of my favorites.9.0/10			"

												Great game.  If you haven't played the first one then pick that one up first.  This is a continuation of the story from the first one.  I had originally picked this one up on disk and played it a ton.  Even knowing all the fights it still took me over 6 hours to complete and I literally ran though it.   Thie first one took me over 9 hours running at the same pace.  This series really stands out from the rest for presentation and story.  It just makes me sad that they don't make games like this anymore.			"

												Earned in Blood can be treated as a direct expansion to Road to Hill 30. Using the same type of elements, EiB continuous the unique tactical-FPS that the Brothers in Arms series offers. EiB offers greater diversity in environments and has limited expansions in squad commands. If you own and enjoyed Road to Hill 30 then Earned in Blood is a must.			"

												Its a great mix of FPS and Strategy, All the characters are unique. AI is buggy though, Allies often do stupid things like hide on the wrong side of a fence and enemy's don't really do anything, So i would reccomend installing rendrocs mods and then in chapter select menu  click ""Mutators"" then add CommandModBasic And DangerousAI. Great game once you get that last part done.			"

												Broters in Arms: Earned in Blood is Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30 with a different story. Nothing has been added or improved mechanic-wise, but at least nothing has been taken out or made worse. It's a nice little expansion pack, but for a sequel, it's hardly recommendable. But you will still like it if you liked Road to Hill 30, and haven't been burned out on it. It's also 2014, so price is cheap anyway.			"

												My nostalgia ruined Road to Hill 30 for me, as I have in a much longer review than this one. But Earned in Blood turned out to live up to it. Even though the game came out within the same year (just over half a year later) as Road to Hill 30, I think it turned out much better. I enjoy the general setup over Hartsock detailing his events and perspectives. I cannot say much about the real-life people, obviously, but I find the execution of this game to be more involving.The gameplay is essentially the same, but the level environments are slightly more developed and lively in comparison to the first game. I know that the games are said to be very realistic, but the first game seems to be more sparse in what you encountered. Further, Earned in Blood has a lot more capability of using the Four F's, whereas Road to Hill 30 did not as much.			"

												Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood delivers the same authentic, tactical World War 2 squad-based action found in the previous game, Road to Hill 30. Earned in Blood introduces some non-story game modes, as well as new levels and story to the classic Brothers in Arms singleplayer campaign. The campaign itself - the main part of this game - is full of memorable characters and an immersive, interesting story. If you're into anything World War 2, Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood (or the previous Road to Hill 30) would be a game to try.			"

												NOTE: If you haven't already, I highly recommend you play the first game (Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30) before playing this title.OverviewThe sequel to Road to Hill 30, the story is carried on by Joseph ""Red"" Hartsock who is reflecting on the previous 15 days in Normandy with Colonel S.L.A Marshall (the guy Mac said was coming to interview them at the end of Road to Hill 30).StoryThe story follows Red, as he tells Colonel Marshall about his days fighting in Normandy from the drop all the way up until the seizing of Saint Sauveur Le Vicomte on D-Day +15. It's mixed between cutscenes of Red and Marshall talking or conversations off screen at the beggining of missions or in quiet moments. Many old faces pop up again, including old references and very interesting moments where you get to see what happened whilst you were off playing as Baker in the previous title. The game stays true in general to the campaign in Normandy, and most of the battles/missions in this game were really fought during the second world war. The story is very intense and emotional in some places and succeeds like the previous game in showing the horror and violence of war.GameplayEarned in Blood is essentially the same core gameplay as the previous game, using the Four F's (Find, Fix, Flank and Finish.) You have two squads, the Fire team, and the Assualt team. You can command them to follow you, move to locations that you choose, suppress an enemy and even charge an enemy. One of the main HUD aspects is the suppression indicator on top of the enemies' heads. Red means unsuppressed and grey means suppressed and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ their pants. The basic method of overcoming enemies according to the game is to:1. Get your Fire team to suppress the enemy.2. Take you Assault team around and flank the enemy.3. Once you are at the enemies' flank, rek them.Although this is the barebones method, a lot of the time it isn't that simple. I came into this title expecting it to be the exact same combat as the previous game, but Gearbox have managed to switch it up a bit, with improved AI that will react to your tactical descisions, for example, if you flank the enemy and they know this is happening, they reposition themselves so they are protected and are safer from you/your men. That being said, I still did see some of the silly AI appearing like in the previous game, for example you order your men to take cover from an MG and they end up running around the cover and standing in plain sight. Also, there are some pathing issues which can lead to some annoying squad wipes. The guns sights sway like hell, so you will still find yourself missing easy shots although there are two new guns (Grease Gun, Scoped FG42) which can lead to some interesting firefights. Another addition to the game are the Flak 88's. These bad boys are a nightmare to go up against and can prove a real challenge, especially when multitasking in battle.  Unfortunately, the game doesn't have much of a replay value unless you are ok with replaying on a harder difficulty with less forgiving enemies and less HUD etc.Map DesignCompared to Road to Hill 30, Earned in Blood has really knocked it up a gear in terms of maps. While still slightly linear (hard not to be in this genre) they are a lot more expansive and give you more options in terms of attack and flanking. Also, the game no longer stays in a green-french-rollinghills type of landscape and occasionally offers a change of scene with city combat, which is quite fun and engaging with all of the flank routes. This, combined with the better AI can lead to some challenging moments.Graphics, Animations and Sound Earned in Blood's graphics, animations and sound are pretty much identical if not exactly the same as the previous game. Textures are a bit murky and lip sync is not alway in time or accurate. The sound is very good in most cases, apart from some anomalies for example VERY MINOR SPOILER:(When you are attacked by the convoy of Germans and their loud horsies, the sound of the hooves is kinda loud and not in any general direction.) The soundtrack, like all Brothers in Arms games is fantastic and always sets the mood just right and makes emotional scenes just that bit more sadder. Although the graphics and animations are well below today's standards, this shouldn't be a problem unless you are somebody who only plays games for the high end visuals and not for the great gameplay and story. ExtrasThe game has many rewards for completing each mission, and the higher the difficulty level on which you complete the level, the more you unlock. Some of the things you unlock are real documents written by Colonel S.L.A Marshall about the interviews with soldiers, historic and de-classified documents about the conflict, pictures, diagrams, and even cheats for the game like infinite ammo and super squads etc. It's worth the extra difficulty for the rewards in my opinion.VerdictOverall this game is fantastic and just as good as the previous game, Road to Hill 30. Although they share many qualities, there have been many welcome additons to the game such as better AI and maps, as well as new weapons and enemies. The story in this game and infact all Brothers in Arms games is fantastic, really covering the emotional effect of war on both sides. The game has always given me a personal connection with the men in my squad, and really does make you feel guilty at the end of your mission if you didn't get that bundle of pixels home. If you're looking for a WW2 game with solid mechanics, decent realism, a super story with emotional moments and connections, this game is definintely for you!			"

												Honestly can't recommend the BiA series enough, ofcourse play the first one (hill 30) before this if you havn't as its story links directly to that one and you'll appreciate the characters more.Gameplay is fun, still in 2016, and the voice acting/story creates a very immersive experience. If one of your troops fall you really feel bad about it, especially since you're the one that told them to be in the line of fire.easily a 10/10 experience. the level design keeps things fresh through the whole campaign and the gun handling still feels good to this day.

												This series is, along with OpFor, proof that Gearbox isn't the worst developer on the planet Earth.They may be pathological liars, but they ♥♥♥♥ up when a production of theirs is outsourced, half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥from the get go or largely NOT theirs (the last two apply to Duke Forever, the first to Aliens: Colonial Marines). They don't ♥♥♥♥ up when they're trying.While I believe certain games like Borderlands can result in a loss of interest fairly quickly, it's still not a 'bad' game - just average.The BIA series is about twenty times better than that.

												Earned in Blood is very realistic and the combat features are superb, It's great that you have to take damage into account unlike CoD where you get shot and your health regenerates, so you have to been more tactical which is meant to enhance you strategic ability, and this applies to those you command during missions. And unlike CoD ammo conservation is key you can spray bullets and knowing you have hundreds of rounds in reserve, you only have a few clips. This game is focussed around real time combat strategy and when you run from place to place this makes you aim less accurrately and takes time to recover. The team you command during missions must be used effectively to complete the mission. This game I'd say on a level of realism is higher than CoD (by far) and slightly below Arma. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys FPS and stragey based games. And throws you into the events of the days both before and after D-day and is historically accurate.			"

												Even though this and RTH30 were made around the same time, I feel that, whereas RTH30 has a lot of good ideas but a flawed execution, EiB tightens almost all the faults of its predecessor and hits the mark its aiming for a lot more frequently. The gameplay itself is more-or-less identical to RTH30, but narratively it does something bold and actively undermines the perspective and heroics of the main character of the first game. In RTH30 you played troubled and occasionally whiney Matt Baker, and in EiB, his friend and occasional squadmate Red Hartsock. We see that Red's perspective of events differs quite strongly from Matt's, and that the character you played before wasn't viewed as quite the hero as the game made you feel. He is seen to be losing his mind and as such Red begins to distrust and even resent him. The dialogue feels a lot less clunky this time round, and the story hits the emotional peaks in a much stronger way. The sound effects are still fantastic and really immerse you in the battlefield, and the voiceover work is of better quality this time round, although there are small but noticable moments of lacking audio that lower your immersion and occasionally undermine the emotion of the moment. I felt like the level design of this game is superior to the first, and as such, I rarely felt like I was being funnelled into a kill-corridor in which you were damned no matter which path you chose. Searching for flanking routes and thinking outside the box is almost always rewarded, and allows you to feel like you're genuinely outwitting the enemy. There is the odd AI brainfart, which is at best funny when you shoot an enemy and he stand there like nothing happened, and at worst rage inducing as your teammates move to the outside of cover rather than finding a proper place to hide, but generally speaking the enemy AI is quite strong, and they'll shift and change cover in order to confront a flanking threat. Tonally the game is as dark as the first, and in its efforts to mimic the real feel of battle, the game is a sombre one. I feel rather harrowed now that it's done, and it makes a small but powerful effort to compliment the player's decision making when you keep your teammates alive. I think this is one of the best and most realistic-feeling WW2 games ever made, whilst also managing that fine balance that allows things to remain fun to play. I highly recommend this game, but you WILL need to have played the first one, in order to understand the story.			"

												Brother in Arms: Earned in Blood is a classic WWII first person shooter. The graphic is dated but that is to be expected for any game from before “Modern Warfare’s” era. The story in-game tells a fantastic tale about a solider behind enemy lines.  The very nice voice acting only adds to the immersive experience. One original feature in this game is the ability to zoom out in to tactics mode and analyze the battlefield, this allows for alternative strategies and less linear gameplay. Beating missions with impressive performance will unlock additional fictional history about the in game characters, as well as other small bonuses. I had a few gripes with this game. The game is stupidly over scripted; your experience will not change at all with a second play through, using different strategies and routes can lead to some problems such as un-jumpable ledges, un-jumpable fences, and other stupid obstacles blocking what appears to be “jumpable” in any other game.

												I love WW2! I love this game because you are the commander and you have to tell ur men to fire or move somewhere. Its nothing like COD2 or any of them because in call of duty it takes 5 minutes to compelete a mission. But in this game it takes like 20 minutes if not less or more to more on to the next chapter. Totally worth buying!			"

												Earned in blood plays exactly like the first game. I didn’t like Road to hill 30, I thought it was a mediocre World War 2 shooter and my thoughts on that game carry over to this one too. Again the great voice acting and the decent story save this game from being a disaster but to me, it doesn’t save it from mediocrity. Knowing that the game plays exactly like the first one before playing it, I played it on easy this time to get the game over and done with and just see what the story offers, and the game ends up being less than 4 hours. I’m not sure if this was a standalone expansion to the first game, because it sure plays like one. 4/10 (Mediocre)			"

												it's not bad, but I would say brothers in arms franchise do not live upto classic call of duty nor medal of honor standard. The title brought most of the elements from the previous title, Brothers in Arms road to Hill 30.Let me begin with good aspect of the title. The music is great. The writings aren't bad. The recoil and shooting experience actually feel very authentic. Not a dead-right-on accuracy, but less accurate iron sight gives an impressive remark. and that's about it. While it is trying very hard to impress and attach emotions to chracters, it feels too short to be attached. I feel like I was more attached to chracters in call of duty like Pvt Elder when stealing a car. He died the next mission? dang I liked that guy. Poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Here, a pop-up screen of your soldier bleeding and smashed face shown time to time when they are injured and about to die. Then big cross mark on the pic if he is dead. Welp, that's too bad. Didn't feel much other than NPC supporter. The mission designs are too linear. I do appreciate how dev developed suppressing fire and morale system have developed, but they should have not used it as a core mechanic. For almost all missions, you order your men to suppress an enemy behind cover, and you get to become a hero by flanking and kill the rest of enemies. Or send other squad to flank them. Because dev wanted to force players to use flanking tactic, you will very less likely to snipe enemies from cover. But I think it improved from the last title as it nearly was impossible to kill. Also you are on the offense side most of the time. Enemies on defense will very less likely to move out of cover or even try to reposition. They will wait to be flanked. Sure it is not like shootem up style, more focused on tactic, but there should have been more tactic other than flanking.I can't tell what exactly triggered the reason, but I less enjoyed this title compared to the last one. Possibly because of the level design which I find it ironical as I thought the first title had a very linear mission designs.			"

												the no1 reason to not buy it ? because its ubisoft ofcourse, the worsed dev in history of gaming imo..oh man cant even describe the problems i had with them over the years , on top of their shameless greed ofcourse.but this game just doesnt work right, aiming accuracy is terrible, very weird hitbox in close encounter, ergo no dmg no matter how many times i shoot them in the head, from 1 feet away lolaccuracy in general is way off, witch kills the gameplay, and the stupid gun fills my screen completely, as a matter of fact, i just found out there is a mod that actualy makes you hit where you aim, how about that...[not 100 procent acc but better then default]walking is too slow, jumping too low , ai dies off all the time also, ending up soloing everything. ended up very frustrated with this weird gameplay, wasnt a fun experience at all, so its a no go, lucky i got it on sale.

												I really don't understand why this game has such fantastic reviews. Even compared to the FPS games of its time it's terrible.The gunplay is basically nonexistant. The aiming is terrible, the iron sights look like the designer smudged them by accident, and it feels as if 2 out of every 3 shots is a blank. You can supress enemies pretty easily though, since you don't actually have to hit them to do so. The only gun I enjoyed using was the scoped rifle, because every shot went where you aimed, and every shot seemed to actually do something when it hit its target.This makes you think your job is to sit back and supress your enemies while you let your assault team deal with them up close. You cannot do that, because your assault team is guaranteed to run up to the enemy, miss all their shots, and then get immediately killed. The friendly AI cannot do anything besides distract enemies and keep them indefinitely suppressed.The enemy AI on the other hand is wildly varied in its ability. If you are more than 10 metres away from them, they either don't shoot at you, or miss all their shots. If you get anywhere close to them, they will pop out of cover, and either continue to miss all their shots, or remove basically all of your health, which I will get to later. The best part is when you are sitting in cover, and a panzerfaust or mortar flies over your cover, puts you down to red health, and knocks you to the ground for an incredibly long amount of time. The only way to actually kill anything is to throw your useless bots off in one direction, turn all the enemies, and then fire wildly into their side with whatever automatic weapon you have.Now we can talk about the health system. It's an old fashioned no-recharge health system, which is totally fine. The problem is that their is absolutely no way to heal. Unlike almost every other game in existence, there are no medkits or healing items at all. You get hit by one of those mortars or panzerfaust halfway through the level? Enjoy trying to finish the rest of the level without taking a single hit. Same goes for your bots. They get obliterated by a grenade early on? Enjoy trying to finish the level alone. Luckily, if you die enough times in a row, you can choose to restart from the checkpoint, which is likely 15 minutes back, and heal yourself and all your men.This game does not deserve the reviews it gets. It's not a good realistic war game. It's not a good arcade war game. It's not a good game. The story is pretty good, if not let down a little by the weak facial animations and ocassionally odd voice acting, which isn't out of place for the time that this game came out. My verdict?If you want a fun WWII Singleplayer experience. Play Medal of Honour.In you want a good WWII story about US troops. Watch Band of Brothers.			"

												Nice ''sequel'' of sorts to RtH30 through the eyes of a different squadmate.This could be considered it's downfall however as there are only a few chapters that really continue on the squad's collective story and instead focus' on Red's story.Some great moments in this game but it doesn't really add anything new to the game (they were released a year apart) and it could be skipped without missing out on too much that it will affect a Hell's Highway playthrough.Would still recommend if you enjoyed both the gameplay and story in RtH30!

												Story and the concept of the game are good. This game has some major issues though. The Allied AI is atrocious and causes a great deal of frustration, furthermore the game is riddled with artificial difficulty. A good example of this is the fact that a lot of times when you clearly should have hit an enemy you actually miss. This is mainly an issue if you try to for example shoot an enemy in the head when he pops out of cover. I guess is a way to force you to use the flanking mechanics the game has, but it's still very frustrating.If you want a good Brothers in Arms game get Hell's Highway.			"

I did not feel Hartsock's story as genuinely as I did Baker's, but the same characters that we love are back.  The maps were larger and the AI was a bit better.

												Spoiler warning While the locaions the campain take place in aren't all that original the gameplay and the characters are great. the gameplay is made great by the fact tha the encounters are small compared to say cod. since there is a manageable amount of enemies on screan. these enemies can be overcome with good use of cover and commanding your squads well. you really get a band of brothers vibe from the characters that is lovely. you will feel its sucks when you make a mistake and someone dies (despite them comming back to life for the next mission.) this game has a good value single player campaign. that really makes you care about the soldiers. MAKE THE LAST PART IN THE SERIES UBISOFT.This is basicly the same review i gave the first one. the only small thing that could have been done better is there is a moment in game when you get injured doesn't effect gameplay. it would have been nice if you ware to injured in a way that wouldn't have allowed use of weapons or being unable to reload.

The game is great if you don't like to run n gun and would prefer to use tactics but not with slow paced game play. It has aged nnnnnnnnot well but the gameplay is good. When aiming down the gun sights the gun moves around A LOT which is ♥♥♥♥ing annoying but fixed with a much needed patch. All 'round a classic game I am enjoying replaying. Not perfect and not as good as the newest game in this series or the first game, but a good game, still.			"

												If you appreciate realism, riveting gunplay, World War II, and gritty historical accuracy; then this is the perfect game for you. Just as good/if not better then Road to Hill 30.			"

												Spoiler warning While the locaions the campain take place in aren't all that original the gameplay and the characters are great. the gameplay is made great by the fact tha the encounters are small compared to say cod. since there is a manageable amount of enemies on screan. these enemies can be overcome with good use of cover and commanding your squads well. you really get a band of brothers vibe from the characters that is lovely. you will feel its sucks when you make a mistake and someone dies (despite them comming back to life for the next mission.) this game has a good value single player campaign. that really makes you care about the soldiers. MAKE THE LAST PART IN THE SERIES UBISOFT.This is basicly the same review i gave the first one. the only small thing that could have been done better is there is a moment in game when you get injured doesn't effect gameplay. it would have been nice if you ware to injured in a way that wouldn't have allowed use of weapons or being unable to reload.

												MULTIPLAYER STILL WORKS OVER TUNNGLEOne of if not the best WW2 games of all time.  Makes you fear the bullets, kills feel like accomplishments, not your run of the mill ""commando"" style game.Utilizing your teams effectively will lead to victory, ignoring tactics will lead to heavy losses.THERE ARE MODS CALLED MUTATORS WHERE YOU CAN HAVE 30 VS 30, ALLIES VS AXIS !!!!!!!!!!!-bodies wont rot, so it turns from a skirmish into a battle, and the scene becomes highly dramatic-Germans throw smoke grenades, which adds tremendous mystery, atmosphere and danger to battles-I am working on getting my  brothers a PC that can run this old game so we can play together over TUNNGLE-still works guys, keep the faith.  oh and you have to go download the mutators, not sure if they work over multiplayer.

												I remember many years ago back in school getting extremely excited for the first game in this series; excited by it's realism and tactical gameplay. The game is great if you don't like to run n gun and would prefer to use tactics but not with slow paced game play. It has aged nnnnnnnnot well but the gameplay is good. When aiming down the gun sights the gun moves around A LOT which is ♥♥♥♥ing annoying but fixed with a much needed patch. All 'round a classic game I am enjoying replaying. Not perfect and not as good as the newest game in this series or the first game, but a good game, still.			"

												+ iconic tactical shooter+ you get attached to the characters and the story+ weapons diversity. Can use German guns.+ you feel responsible of your squad+ general ambience, soldiers swearing, bullets flying, visual effects- AI- challenging for neophytes - old but not obsolete - redundant - save system The Brothers in Arms series is a pure tactical shooter and characters oriented game. You play as a US squad leader during WWII and your goal is to passby enemies lines while keep your men alive. Charge heads in and your entire squad will perish. Outflank the enemy and you will win. The game is actually entirely centred around flanking tactic. Advance, get cover, suppress the enemy with nourished fire, flank, finish the job. Do it again and again. This concept although redundant never goes out of fashion. The game will offer formidable and exiting challenges making it harder to flank enemies. Concerning the difficulty the game can be almost impossible to complete in higher difficulty, and is challenging enough in normal difficulty level.What I really like about this game is the tactics, the different weapons available, and the story line.However the game is old and the AI is not faultless. Enemies sometime go banzai and end up dead or sometime your own units take the most suicidal path to reach their destination so make sure to guide them well. In higher the difficulty level the game can be also extremely frustrating. Furthermore the accuracy of the weapons seems to have been reduced ostensibly to make the skirmishes last longer. Finally the saves system is just horrendous, it comes under auto an auto save system in which you cannot manually saves your game during the mission. If you die you must restart from the last auto save which can be really annoying during tough missions.			"

												This shooter is a not a run-and-gun WW2 shooter. You have to use your teammates to fire on the enemy (to fix them), and then you have to go around and shoot them in the back (flank them). If you aim your gun at an enemy behind cover and fire, you'll have a 5% chance of killing them. There's this ""invisible cover bonus"" that the game only hints on. You have to fix and fire or else you will waste a lot of ammunition and it will irritate you. When you are shooting an exposed enemy (outflanked), your accuracy jumps to 100%.Your teammates are very fragile so it'll annoy you when your teammates die from an 88 cannon from across the map or your tank blows up after 2 hits because you told it to back up and it went forward instead.Luckily, you can eat up a lot of bullets so your primary duty is to do everything important (like Call of Duty). For some reason, there's no sprinting so you end up slime-trailing everywhere you go. They should have called you ""Sergeant Slow."" There's this feeling of impending death whenever you have to walk across some machine gun fire. You can feel your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ clench up.If you don't follow this shooter's special rules, nothing will make sense and you'll get angry. FIX and FLANK. Shooting enemies behind cover will reduce your gun's accuracy to 5%.A pretty special ""tacti-cool"" shooter.			"

												Earned in Blood is the second installment of the Brothers in Arms series. In this game you play as Joe Hartsock, one of the members of Sgt. Backer’s squad. In this game, you fight parallel to the story of Road to Hill 30 and get to see the story form another angle.Just like the first game, this one is still a slow paced, tactics based shooter with some of the draw backs from the previous game. No way to heal in battle, low weapons accuracy (although its more precise then it feels). Just like the other game, this title still contains a great story and top notch “horrors of war”.As I said in my review of Road to Hill 30, if you are looking for a run and gun shooter this game is not for you. It is, however, a well done tactics based war game with a story that pulls at the heart.			"

												This is a series that doesn't get enough attention. While Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, and Battlefield are trying to sell you high-intensity multiplayer and a rehashed ""nuclear apocalypse"" plot, Brothers in Arms goes back to the Second World War, and tells you a gripping story about the men who did and did not survive it. This is one of the few games that has ever brought me close to tears.If you are looking a for a shooter with an actual story, and amazing first-person squad command, Brothers in Arms is simply an amazing pick.

												This game belongs in nostolgia more than active play. For 2002 this game was pretty cool.It feels like Men of War : the single player experience.Other than that I will give it a good review since they did make an effort to have it difficult.			"

												Wow.  I've had this for a while but just finished the story.  Incredible.The game play is a great mix of FPS, squad tactics, and puzzle solving (as in, where can I set my base of fire to best protect my assault team?).Plus the story is very moving and intense.  Really well done.  The research and effort that went into this game is incredible.			"
