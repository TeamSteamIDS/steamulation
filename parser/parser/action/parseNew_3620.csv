												Overall this is a great puzzle game! I highly reccomend this to anyone who likes puzzle games or anyone who likes casual games; because Zuma is one of those games that you play in order to relax after work or school.If there were any complaints that I have about the game it would have to be the bosses. The problem with the bosses is the fact that you can't lose any lives when fighting them so, because of that; there really is no fear in losing all your lives and starting from your last check point. In turn this is also be a good thing so, that you really don't need to stress when fighting them. But other than that, it's a great game and for the price, it's entirely worth it! Many diffrent levels to play, cool powerups, and relaxing gameplay, makes this a good buy!			"

Is not an easy game, though; the adventure mode last missions are quite challenging, and it has another cool game modes that helps to replay it. I strongly recomend it.			"

By far one of my favourite pass time games I had when I just wanted to chill. To my excitedment the game was on Steam and I was very happy to purchase it.However, there are far too many bugs and I'm very disapointed in the game. The cursor consistantly bugs out through the game and now matter what settings I choose it won't come right. Can't shoot at the right colours because I have no idea where the invisible cursor is.

												Ever played a 'match 3 colors' game ? You know what I'm talking about, there are hundreds, and a lot of them are even free Flash games. Let me tell you another thing; this is one of them. And even though it isn't free, it's quite a bit of fun. Don't ask me how they pulled it off but it's addictive; it has a certain feeling I can't put my finger on. A feeling I have with all Popcap games, it's insane really. So... have a few minutes of spare time ? Play this, it's an excellent game for those moments. But... is it worth the current price ? Err.. no. You might want to get this if it's €5 or less. Or play a similar game for free on the Internet.[Rating: 75/100]			"

												Pop Cap games are truly a mixed bag. On one hand, you could get lucky with Plants Vs. Zombies or Peggle. But, on the other, you could be playing Zuma's Revenge. Before continuing, I would like to note that this review is coming from solely playing the adventure mode. Zuma's Revenge's adventure mode has you playing as a frog on an island, making your way through on your adventure. The gameplay seems to be simple, Zuma having a color ball and having to match three or more of the same color of ball on the track before the balls reach a certain point to which you have to restart the round. On paper, this seems quite simple but the game needs polish as it becomes frustrating when the game solely relies on luck to win the round. The music to the game is simple but, unfortunately, lacking. The same song always plays, allowing for no diversity and not giving the player any reason to keep listening.In adventure mode, the frog most fight bosses but it doesn't feel like there are any at all. For the most part, the bosses are simple, the only boss which is noticable is the last one because of it's three-stage gauntlet. To wrap up, Zuma's Revenge seems to be attempting to ride on the success of Peggle, a game which came out two years prior. However, where Peggle is both skill intensive and luck intensive, Zuma's Revenge simply relies on luck to get through. I did put in almost eight hours playing this game but that wasn't because I was having fun, that's because luck wasn't on my side. When the right set-up and power-ups came up, I was able to finally get past a stage that troubled me, no skill involved. If you have the money and would like to play a mindless game, buy Peggle instead.			"

												Bought this game a long time ago, and decided to try it just now, the game crashes 100% of the time, upon completing the very 1st level (or even mid 1st level).I've tried windowed mode - the same problemThere is an option for low-res textures - but turning off hi-res restarting the game and nothing happens in the settings. For your comparsion, I have Win7 x64 (People say its only broken for Win10 no it's not)This game is just broken now.Reading the forums shown that a lot of people have the same problem after some point in 2015, with a lot of PopCap games(But bejeweled and chuzzle seems working for me), and steam support does nothing but offers a refund (it been half a year since I bought the game so I cant refund).Do not buy it unless you see any changes at the forum.

												Run of the mill game in the shoot-wire-match-three genre of Puzz Loom heritage, challenging but heavily relying on luck. It looks and sounds nice, but mechanics are basic, half of the power-ups are useless (and are rather rare overall) and level-design is extremely pedestrian. But worst of all last chapter is extremely unfair with last boss just spaming stun attacks while aim is deliberately off.			"

												There's a pretty blatant ""screw the player"" algorithm built-in, which you can clearly see if you go back and replay early levels after you've gotten some practice. It's quite obvious that chance alone can't explain why it leans so heavily toward feeding you balls that will do nothing but force you to push the line closer to the failure point. Skilled ""twitch"" gamers can probably get around it pretty easily, but later levels are going to be pretty much impossible for a fairly large segment of the population. I'm not opposed to ""twitch"" games in general, but this is marketed as ""casual"". There's nothing ""casual"" about a game that's intentionally designed to use frustration as an artificial difficulty barrier.			"

												So far, tried all the troubleshooting, the game won't launch.It thinks it did, sits there running but nothing comes up on screen and game has to be killed through task manager.Bought this through the Humble Bundle, and it is the first time I've been disappointed (and very disappointed) in one of their offerings.I suspect the issue lies with Pop-Cap, not HB, but still not a good showing.

												The game is fun for what it is and provides a bit of ""I am so bored I will play a facebook app"" fun. But that's just the thing, there is a free version of this basically anywhere browser gaming is. I do not recommend this game to anyone for that reason.			"

												Zuma's Revenge is a lot bigger game than Zuma. It's got the same addictive game play though. It starts out easier than Zuma but offers a number of challenges and higher difficulty levels to play on. This game is perfect for when you have ten minutes to kill.			"

												Only way to play is to run the entire campaign in one sitting, get insanely burned out and have painful dreams about shooting colored balls at lines for a week or so.How could that not be recommended?In that single sitting, about 40 games in, I find myself giving color commentary like a game announcer about the particularly good or bad shots I make.  Yes the game will drive you insane. "

												Another PopCap game of their usual high quality. Just look at the screenshots and you know what it is all about... but make sure to look at the moving pictures to get an idea how intense this whole marble-pushing business can become. Difficulty starts at newbie level, but gets insanely high towards the end of the campaign. I would personally prefer a more relaxed pacing with more thinking and less reflexes involved. Maybe they should do a ""Geronto-Zuma"" (for senior citizens).			"

												Zuma's Revenge is another well made casual action puzzle game by PopCap Games.  The game is brightly colored, easy to learn, but occasionally quite challenging.  The sound design and tropical theme work very well together and none of the effects used become to grating or repetitious.  There is a main puzzle campaign as well as other challenge modes that can be unlocked, as well as a final boss for each stage of the story mode.  Altogether I would recommend this game to any of my friends who like casual puzzle games, as this title has both the gameplay and polish necessary to deliver hours of entertainment.			"

												In grand Popcap tradition, Zuma's Revenge is a simple game to learn, but exciting and satisfying to play and play and play.  The premise has a line of multi-colored marbles inching their way along a pre-defined path towards an ultimate drop-dead point and you have to shoot similar colored marbles at the line in order to create matches of at least three marbles.  Different bonuses will allow greater control over the advancing line, but the real progress comes from simply being dextrous enough to notice the matches and quickly fire accurately.  The game is relatively stress free until the final levels when the game starts throwing interlocking looped paths which block your ability to manipulate the entire line and forcing you to act quick and precise to keep things managable.  At certain points the game changes and you face off against different ""boss"" characters which employ subtle variations to the game techniques.  The experience prooves to be very satisfying and quite rewarding.			"

												A fun ""connect 3"" type puzzle game that is pretty addictive. Basically, you clear out strings of rolling balls by matching colors. The main game mode is ""Adventure"", and is  60 levels. You are allowed to save your progress every 5 levels. Once you finish this mode you can replay it on a much harder setting called ""Heroic Frog."" ""Iron Frog"" is a gauntlet where you have to complete 10 very hard levels with only a single life. Very tough to do... I've still only gotten up to level 5. Finally , ""Challenge mode"" has you try and complete several series of levels in different difficulty levels. It's fun until you reach the last and hardest level of difficulty, because you have to have unlocked them in ""Iron Frog"" before you can play it here. And as I said before, that's really hard to do.If you like puzzle-type matching games, you might want to give it a try.			"

												A good time-killer that involves more strategy the further along you get. Level progression moves the game from simple time-killer to legit strategy puzzles. As with many games, they display hints and tips during various load points.Everything is based on how close the conga line is to the end point, which means that EVERY normal game is time based. The boss ""fights"" have some sort of twist that negates, or doesn't bother with, a time component. I have a harder time with timed puzzles, so this becomes especially difficult for me sometimes.Despite the game's challenges, the aesthetics are along the lines of cheesy humor. Adult-level chalenge is present, but the bright colors and simple animations encourage kids to play. Easily frustrated players will probably have some difficulties in the later levels.			"

												After 400+ hours of playing it, I can still challenge myself: can I go below 13 mins on Iron Frog? Top my score in Adventure or Heroic Frog? Or just push Challenge mode some more to set more high scores. I can play this game many hours a day, or just a few minutes a week; hold a hiatus of one month or more, then get down to it again - it will never get old. I can recommend this to anyone between 10 and 110 years - and hope PopCap will make another Zuma title some time. :)			"

												Zuuma. Now this is an awesome game, and I imagine almost everyone have played it at least once.This is the sequel to Zuma (deluxe). You are a frog - a line (or more) of colored balls are rolling towards a golden coin with a skull on. You ""puke"" (spit?) a colored ball, and by matching the same color so it's three or more, they are removed. You can also ""puke"" at fruits and such, to gain more points, which in normal play mode means stopping the balls faster and finishing the level quicker.  Some balls also turn special, gain laser, canonballs, supersight.. It's a fun and really, really addictive game. Should be good fun for pretty much anyone.			"

												I thought Zuma's Revenge was such a calming game. I played it when I needed to chill out. That all changed when I hit level 13. Suddenly I got to jump between two lily pads and play two games of Zuma at once? Oh hell no. You can't just change a game on someone like that. It's hurting my head. I cannot deal with this kind of change. How could you do this to me Pop Cap? I cannot play this game past level 13 anymore. I'll just have to repeat levels 1 to 12 over and over now.

												If you haven't played a Marble Shooting game before, This is the one for you. Some of the levels are like the Original Zuma, whilst some are like Luxor from MumboJumbo. EA, did Popcap get Inspired by MumboJumbo to make their levels like Luxor?			"

												Zuma's Revenge is a great sequel in Pop Cap's long line of outstanding IP. A simple concept to get used to, Zuma's Revenge takes colour matching and accuracy and throws them together in a fast paced and satisfying arcade-like game that ramps in difficulty nicely across some really quite attractive looking levels. Great for casual shorter game sessions or people who want to get their twitch on for some of the more intense mini games like Ironman mode			"
