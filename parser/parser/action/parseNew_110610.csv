												Despite the cringe inducing title and painful art style this game provides a solidly put together run-n-gun platformer with surprisingly tight controls. Worth playing if you have somehow found this in your library without a clue how it got there (like myself) and are wondering whether to install.			"

												Pom Pom, does know how to make good old school shooters. AZM plays a bit like the old Spectrum game Jet Pac with waves of enemies spawning to testing your twitch reflexes as you chase a high score. While the presentation is only passable it plays rather well, though the high intensity of the game means it is best enjoyed in small doses.			"

												This game is a masterpiece. I'm a gamer since the Atari days and while I still play a lot, the fun I get is obviously not the same of when I was young. Well, this game succeded in re-creating the same pure joy I was experiencing back then. The graphics are frankly unattractive and the user interface is a bit amateurish but the core gameplay...that's distilled fun for you to enjoy. Last time I liked a game so much was with Trolls and Tribulations for the Commodore 64...			"

												There's nothing quite like playing as Santa Claus with Laser Gun fighting Aliens on what appears to be a floating Musical Staff. If you haven't experienced it, be sure to try out AZMD. While not the greatest survival sidescroll shooter, it is definitely one of the most unique. Very straightforward and easy to pickup and put down at any time. The levels get progressively much more difficult, but it's well worth unlocking many of the UFO's and extra spacesuits.That being said, I will add that the achievements in this game (particularly 'All the Medals') are insanely hard to get. I am less than proud to say that I endured to earn them after countless hours of gameplay and testing. The reward was definitely not worth the time invested as I feel that they were made unnecessarily difficult. In particular Leves 24-Alpha and 31-Alpha have boss count achievements that are horrendously tested/scaled. I walked away feeling less achieved and more unnerved that I'd lost so much time learning to do something completely pointless.			"

												It's not bad, but it's not good either. Yes, it has a 'retro' feel about its simple gameplay and yes, it has good controls, but it's just too bland to be fun. You shoot things left and right (literally), gather crystals and sometimes carry things to a gathering point. There are platforms, but they are just horizontal lines that stretch through the whole 'level'. You get weapon upgrades and unlock spacesuits over time. That's the game. It's very repetative and while that was fun in Pang over 20 years ago, it just doesn't hold up today (plus Pang at least tried to put some effort into giving you some motivation).If you look for a very simple shoot 'em up this might be for you, but in general I think it doesn't offer enough to hold your attention for more than 15-20 minutes.

												Alien Zombie Megadeath is a 2D game with a very simple concept and controls, mostly requiring only that you move vertically between long platforms, weaving between traps and destroying alien zombies with your blaster along the way.There are many (very short) missions on the map with objectives ranging from destroying all the baddies, endless survival mode and rescuing space babies before the zombies eat their brains. Along with the handful of Steam achievements there are in-game unlockables to earn such as medals and different spacesuits.True to its arcade-like nature temporary power-ups frequently drop and of course there are multipliers, high scores and leaderboards.  Also includes gamepad support.			"

												This is a really fun bullet-hell platformer game. You need quick reactions to jump out of the way of multiple enemies at once, and almost lighting reflexes to kill them all without dying while also building up your score for extra medals. What really makes this game even funner is the local co-op. You can have a blast playing with your buddy while you shoot off a few hours smashing aliens working for high scores. I probably wouldn't recommend people went out their way to play this. but if you can pick it up in a bundle it is well worth your time.			"

												It's an ok action 'platformer'. Not really a platformer in the traditional sense, but you have multiple platforms that you can jump on. It's limited to one, full, screen and it's not a sidescroller. While jumping around you have to kill enemies, collect crystals, defuse bombs and save children. Might be fun in small doses, but it's not exactly groundbreaking.[Rating: 67/100]			"

												A game that is fun despite itself. Name is awful, gameplay is competent (has some hitbox issues like mad as you go on). If you like score-attack titles this one will win you over with its medals and opening new challenges in earlier levels. The problem is a lot of it seems randomized to some degree and can be the difference between a new record or ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥IT HOW AM I SO MUCH LOWER THAN LAST TIME?!"".Also basically any mission involving the words ""bomb disposal"" or ""space babies"" are the dumbest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ things.

												Alien Zombie Megadeath is a gloriously intense platform shoot-em-up! You are the lone Spaceman, doing boring space work on a random space platform in deep space when suddenly a huge, relentless, alien force attacks! However these are not your normal everyday aliens...these are alien ZOMBIES! Even through his protective helmet, Spaceman is sickend by their smelliness.For the sake of humanity... and Spacemans nostrils... you must take control of the ill-fated Spaceman and fend off the alien zombie hoards. Alien Zombie Megadeath is an oldschool 2D platform shoot-em-up with enemies coming at you from all sides, in all shapes and sizes. You MUST blast them all to smithereens!			"

												Alien Zombie Megadeath doesn't feel old, it actually strikes me as fairly modern and a product of its time. The only thing it about it that is old is the way it makes me feel. Just the name of the game makes me feel old. It is so desperately trying to be cool by throwing tired tropes in a way that it perhaps hopes is ironic. The claim of being “old school” is just another sort of pretension. It wants to re-create the simple colourful joys of past, when a plot was a one paragraph intro before the shooting started but while it throws the story out the window what is left doesn't measure up to the old classics it is trying to ape.I'm struggling to place AZM in a genre. It feels half way between a platformer and a twin stick shooter. It plays most like a twin stick but your little spaceman is affected by gravity (which is odd if you think too much about it) and so can only run along the platforms but each level is made up a half dozen or so liner platforms, all of the same length, stacked above each other so it is like jumping about on some sort of shelving unit. You can also only shoot left and right which makes dealing with the enemies that attack from above and below a pain in the neck and♥♥♥♥♥♥respectively and deaths to them just feel rather cheap. It is a twin stick that robs you of the freedom of movement and attack, the joy of which is the joy of twin stick shooter. It all just feels, well very busy but not very exciting. Very rich and colourful and full of features but not much fun.  It just doesn't feel quite right to me and so I struggled to have fun with it and I don't feel I can recommend it. On the other hand if you enjoy the feel of it then there is certainly a lot of it in terms of content. Utlimately though, If this is old school then I think I am ready to embrace progress.			"

Would make an awesome quick game to jump on with a controler and kill some time.What I didn't like about the game: Not much to dislikeWould I buy at current asking price of 4.99?

												Alien Zombie Megadeath is a throwback to the simply-premised arcade games of yore. You've got a blaster, things want to kill you, kill them first. Difficulty and strategy enter the picture as platform layouts on each level increase in size and complexity, new obstacles enter the mix, and (of course) more and more waves of aliens get lobbed at you. There's not much in the way of depth here, but Alien Zombie Megadeath doesn't really need it. The game straddles the line between survival drive and score chaser, and is better off for not deviating from it.There's a fair amount to do in Alien Zombie Megadeath even with the rather basic concept, with a huge pile of levels to plow through, and some new outfits to unlock as a reward for your efforts. It's also really easy to just pick up and play here and there, be it as stress relief or to knock your friends down a few pegs on the leaderboard.Alien Zombie Megadeath may not look like much, especially for 2011 (I honestly thought it was older), but it's still pretty fun and worth snagging.

												I'd put some time into this one before but I decided to fire it up again to see what it was like. I remembered liking it well enough, and I thought I'd see if it was still worth my time. It's a side scrolling arena shooter that kind of reminds me of some old♥♥♥♥♥arcade game that I don't remember the name of that I only played because it was on some compilation disc (it was called Xenophobe and had the same multi-level structure but honestly wasn't that similar - i looked it up).It's fine. Nothing special, and if I didn't have about a trillion other smaller distractions, I'd be plenty happy playing it a lot more. I'll probably keep it installed for a while and♥♥♥♥♥♥around with it, but I'm probably ok with the 2 hours total I've logged on it already if I don't ever come back to it.One final note, Dave Mustaine is nowhere to be found in this game.

												A quality arcade shooter which I recently re-discovered.With tight controls, loads of levels, a fun aesthetic and simple to learn, hard to master gameplay, it walks the fine line between challenging and frustrating. Its got that ""just one more go"" vibe that will keep you playing for quite some time and with so many levels (some with different game types) it wont get boring fast.I don't remember what I paid for it, but I have a feeling it wasn't enough.
