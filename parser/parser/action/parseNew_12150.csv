TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Max Payne 2: Fall of Max Payne is the sequel to the critically acclaimed and award winning 2001 game, Max Payne. Max Payne 2 is a Third-Person action shooter developed by Remedy Entertainment which was acquired by Rockstar Games whose notable works include the popular Grand Theft Auto (GTA) franchise.Once again the player steps into the shoes of Max Payne, a New York City Detective who, after the events of the first game, went on a downward spiral both in career and personal life, struggling with the death of his family and his newly formed Pain Killer addiction (the direct result of the pain killers taken by the player in the first game to regenerate lost health). While Max is investigating a series of murders and assassinations, Max encounters Mona Sax, a textbook femme fatale who was presumed dead from the first game. Follow Max and Mona's adventure through New York City and discover a conspiracy behind a Mob War between two rival Mafia groups and a deadly team of hitmen called 'The Cleaners' in this film noir love story.PROS:+ Significant and highly noticeable improvements on the graphics, animation and texture quality from the first title+ Better sounds, voice acting and sound track+ Improvements on the innovative Bullet Time game mechanic+ Great locations and level design which goes well with the better graphical fidelity+ Graphic Novel style cutscenes are back and with better delivery+ Expanded weapon variety+ Mission variety+ Challenging Difficulty levels (the game provides a good challenge on any difficulty setting)+ Adaptive difficulty if the player is on Easy Mode. (AI gets toned down and pain killers heal more if the player dies too much on Easy Mode.)+ Magnificent story that surpasses even the first game+ World is ALIVE and more immersive.CONS:- VERY Short (I personally completed it within 5-6 hours)OTHER NOTE:- Replayability: - Linear storytelling is FINE, its a good way to tell a narrative story in a directed pace but Linearity does sacrifice replayability at degree because, after finishing the story, there is little reason to play through it a second time around. Like a good action movie, it's best to be played again after some time has passed. (Copy Pasted from my Max Payne 1 Review)CONCLUSION:I rarely call something a 'MASTERPIECE' but after playing through the whole game, twice (once on my Xbox back in 2005, once again on my PC 2013), and sitting here writing this review, I cannot find any more CONs aside from the short story. Contrast this to the PROS I listed, I can easily say we have an almost perfect action game. Max Payne 2 blends perfectly the immersive storytelling of a good action movie, and the dynamic adrenaline pumping gameplay of a video game.MUST BUY and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for both new and old fans a like. I do, however, not recommend you buy this game solo but instead, BUY the MAX PAYNE BUNDLE which includes the Original Max Payne and Max Payne 2. At $15, this is a game worth your time and money.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is a direct sequel to Remedy Entertainment's critically acclaimed 2001 third-person shooter Max Payne and picks up after the events of its predecessor. The game could be best described as noir-style love story, in contrast to the first that was more of a film noir revenge tale.NYPD detective Max Payne is once again the primary protagonist, although a few very interesting segments sees you play as his love interest, Mona Sax. Max Payne 2 borrows a lot from the original and there are enough hints and references to the previous game which helps keep the narrative interesting and fresh for old-timers.Max Payne 2 is, in many ways, a huge improvement over Max Payne 1. Gone is that constipated look  replaced instead with full 3-D modeled faces. The game also sees an immense graphical upgrade with excellent usage of the Havok 2.0 physics engine. Game characters are more detailed while environment objects, including enemies, tumble and fall very realistically.Gameplay is largely the same with a few refinements to combat. Bullet Time sees an upgrade allowing you to dodge bullets and reload quickly, with a cool whirling animation to go alongside it. This results in a higher body count but also makes gun-play segments a whole lot less challenging. Level designs are, once again, brilliant with mission locales ranging from warehouses, mansions, hospitals and clubs to constructions sites. And the enemy AI is, on a whole, pretty decent although in a few instances they end up killing themselves with their own grenade. The plot is riveting with almost non-stop action throughout. The storyline unfolds in much the same fashion as the original. The usage of graphic novel comics complete with melodramatic over-the-top dialogue sucks you into the game's environment. If anything, the writing is more polished this time around with lots of witty and philosophical quotes thrown into the mix. The story focuses too much upon the love-story angle though which tends to get a bit jarring towards the end. In comparison, the original Max Payne's story, although slightly rough around the edges, was more dark, grittier and compelling than its sequel. For a game that is over twelve years old, Max Payne 2 still holds remarkably well today. It overshadows the original in many aspects while also introducing a few cool mechanics of its own. Simplified mechanics make for interesting combat segments making Max Payne 2 one of the very best third-person shooters ever made.			"

												This is one of the most emotional games on steam. On the outside, Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne looks like a generic shooter with a cool mechanic. But when you start to play and dig into the lore of Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne you just feel like crying. 10/10 without a doubt.			"

												Max Payne might have started it all, but Max Payne 2 perfected it. Of all three entries this one is my favourite. I loved it enough that when it came on Steam I ended up rebuying the damn thing despite owning a rather beautiful physical copy beforehand.The story is knit so tight and full of noir that whatever comes after feels like they are trying to hard. Max Payne also defines adult emo to such an amazing level that one is tempted to start cutting one's wrist while desperately trying to find the adult equivalent of Linkin Park. That is of course easily remedied by the awesome and moody track that plays in background as you weave through the dark New York city trying to find closure to all the demons that live in Max's head.It may have aged, and it doesn't offer the same high fidelity as its modern counterparts, but when you get to the nitty gritty, Max Payne 2 is one of the finest shooter in the market.If only Max Payne 3 could have followed in its footsteps.

												One of the most interesting aspects of Max Payne 2 was how much it expanded upon MP1, but also how different a game it was in general.While both games borrow from old detective stories and graphic novels. Max Payne 2 is moreso inspired by romance stories. The main character is portrayed far more realistically, as a depressed lonely individual who has gotten everything he wanted at the end of the last game. And then a girl from his past re-enters his life and thrusts him on another adventure into the night. I wouldn't say the story was perfect, it is a little short and doesn't have the same mythological basis as the first. But it does it's job and I respect Remedy for attempting to do something different.The gameplay was greatly improved, with a true physics engine and reworked AI. The maps were also made a lot larger and the action a lot more upscale. With friendly AI and a survival mode referred to as ""Dead Man Walking"". Max Payne 2 was a great way to finish Remedy's involvement with the franchise, and is truly a smashing successor to the original.			"

												Max Payne 2 is a classic game, just like the first game. The gameplay is really simple: shoot your way through the levels, using your ability to slow down the time. With or without mods, this game still stands out and never gets old. Even if you've played Max Payne 3, you should love MP2.JUST FREAKING PLAY IT FOR ALL THAT IS HOLY!			"

												A vastly superior game to the already promising original. This game refines in all the right ways, tells a great story and feels great to play. Even by today's standards. It might still be the best implementation of bullet time in a game. It also ditches some of the more clunky aspects of the original - leading to it being more timeless.			"

												Max Payne 2, like its predecessor here on Steam, requires that you run it in compatability mode, Windows ME/2000 (I'm currently on Windows 8.1 64-bit and it ran perfectly fine in compatability mode).The actual game is pretty fun, and it has a couple interesting dialogues - more so than the predecessor. The overall plot feels a bit lame if you compare it to the first game, but it has a lot of redeeming moments, and the gameplay and graphics have both been finetuned a lot since the first game, which makes it very enjoyable. It is definitely worth a play if you haven't played it before. As many classics, however, you have to keep in mind that the game is set in a different era of gaming, and that the gameplay isn't the same standard as it is today.If you plan on playing Max Payne 3, you will definitely want to pick this one and the first one up as well.

												-----DISCLAIMER FOR WIN8/WIN8.1/WIN10 USERS------I had several Problems with this game on Windows 10, but after some research, it runs fine on Windows 10.1. Run in Compatibility mode (Windows XP)2. Rename the install Folder to smth without spaces like: ""MaxPayne2""3. Then in your steamapps folder find appmanifest_12150 and edit the install dir line to match your renamed folder (you might have to close Steam to do this or restart Steam)4. Disable Steam Overlay for this game5. Make sure everything stays the same after Steam restart -> sometimes Steam changes stuff backAfter this steps (and propably 2 Hours looking throug forums -> which is why i decided to post this review) it runs great.-----GAMEPLAY-------The game itself is a masterpiece, equaly in storytelling as well as in gameplay.-I really enjoy the fact that you die very quickly, especially on harder difficulties, which makes this game challening.-The developers designed the gun fights to be realistic -> Bullet to the head enemy dies (same for you) -> no real bosses like in the first game.-This game is really skill rewarding and the more you play it the easier it will get, to a point at which you switch fluently through bullet time, bullet time jumps and real time shooting.-Great arsenal of weapons -> all feel and play different-Overall it's a great fast paced third person shooter, that gets better everytime you play it.-----STORY-------Great Story (dont want to spoiler anything) but if you are into the story I would recommend playing Max Payne 1 first.-I recommend finishing it on hardest difficulty for a suprise ending;)-NOIR comic strips to tell the story is just AWESOME-Funny dialogs between enemys-----SOUND------Awesome music -> gives me goosebumps everytime I'm in the main menu-Good weapon sounds -> you can tell weapons apart just by hearing them shoot (helps to decide how to fight)-Good voiceacting -> Max's voice is super badass-----GRAPHICS------This game still looks amazing for it's age and still has some graphical parts that even newer games can't get right (talking about mirrors -> just try it yourself and you know what i mean;) )-Overall this game aged amazingly well.-Nightmare levels and NOIRE comics have an oustanding artwork.-----CONCLUSION-----Easily one of the best games ever madePlayed this gem in my youth and finished it several times on various difficulties.Was so happy to find it on Steam :)Finished it 4 times as I'm writing this review right now and as you can tell from my playtime it is a rather short game (at least after you finished it several times :P)In my opinion everybody should have played this game and it is a must have in every STEAM library10/10 "

												Max Payne 2 is a third-person shooter that feels like a noir graphic novel.I enjoyed Max Payne 2 like I was watching the season 2 of a TV series: One episode leading to another. The protagonist is a cop that lost his wife and son, then is framed and hunted as a murderer. Anyone who experienced the pain of loving and losing can identify with this. He tries to keep his sanity and kill the demons inside his head. This time, he is not in it for vengeance. Now it’s for “love”, but ultimately to find his “true self”.To me it was not an action game with casual narrative moments, but a narrative with casual action moments.Positive points+ Great story.+ Slow motion.Negative points- Too much shooting.

												Taking a step forward deep into the chaotic endless black desert of insanity.Max Payne 2 eventhough it stands on common ground it really has many differences from its predecessor. Something that made the hard core fans of the first game not like it too much at first.However for me Max Payne 2 really stands out of the library and into my golden list of masterpieces and on the throne with the rest of my most fav titles ever.The game has obvious graphical advancements engine-wise, physics-wise, texture-wise and gameplay-wise.The environmental design stays along the lines of the same dark concept the first game was in and goes deep in the underground paths of life of a world filled with corruption.The design and overall direction gets you straight into the mood of a romance/mafia-drama with strong storytelling elements, incredible naration and amazing voice acting.The character models are completelly different from the first game. I really really loved Timothy Gibbs for Max and Kathy Tong for Mona.Also the gameplay is really smooth, easier to survive compared to the first game mechanism-wise, smarter AI, better slo-mo bullettime feature, better gun design and scripting.What impressed me most about this game is the movie-like quality of the naration and the perfectly scripted quotes in it.The game feels like a dramatic movie that sucks you down to its darkness which bewitches you to not wanna get out.Transforming the line into a blur to what's black or white, what's good or bad, what's life or death, the unique experience of following Max Payne through the events of the game leaved me beyond satisfied.The game also supports mods, and there are tons out there, which increases its replayability value.Glad to have played this game for once more and totally recommending and urging you all who haven't, to buy this asap and play it now. Especially if you are into action/mafia genre games with a strong taste of Noir Drama.			"

												Where do I begin? Max Payne 2 The Fall of Max Payne is a fantastic experience from start to end. Especially if you have the Cinema 2.0 Mod which I used in my playthrough of the game. (The Mod really enhances the experience). Storywise this game is interesting, compelling, and tells a dark tale of Max Payne. Max lost his wife and kid in the previous game and in this one he loses even more (I'm not going to spoil it). The story is told not through cutscenes like in modern games but through something like out of a Graphic Novel. The game is told through 3 Acts all having about 6 to 8 Chapters.Gameplay wise this game has it perfected. It's an old school shooter. It's fun, fast, and can be difficult at times (Except in the last chapter where there is practically painkillers around every damn corner) and Bullet Time is a fantastic feature which allows you to slow down time and shoot in slow-mo just like in an action movie (You can even dodge and jump forward in Slow-Mo). There is also a lot of guns (Even a Minigun) but you lose them in certian chapters and have to collect them again. You do all of this in Third Person which makes it even cooler seen Max dodge bullets and shoot punks.Graphics still hold up today. This game looks great and very little loading screens (only when you get to a new chapter) and character models looks great. It's not any Next-Gen Graphics but it's great vanilla and looks even better with Graphical Mods you can download.Do I recommend this game? Yes. It's a great game.Should you buy it right now or wait for a sale? Buy it now if you have the cash unless you're really tight on money then wait for a sale.Heres the Download link to the mod I used in my playthrough: http://www.moddb.com/mods/cinemaRating: 9.5/10			"

“Like all the bad things in my life,it started with the death of a woman.”Criminally underrated and an often unrecognised milestone for the third-person shooter and gaming as a whole, Max Payne was quite the contrast to everything that had preceded it. While gritty and dark level design was apparent in the likes of Quake, Fallout and Thief, the concept of film noir had yet to be truly tested within the format of a video game. During a time in which the first-person shooter reigned supreme and the so-called “golden age” neared its end, a small Finnish studio decided to try something bold and new.Enter Remedy Entertainment and the landmark that is Max Payne.Armed with a turned-up leather jacket, a weapon in each hand and a tonne of pills, you return as everyone’s favourite anti-hero detective and are unleashed once again upon the filthy underbelly of New York City. Caught within the throes of a rapidly deteriorating gang war and still gripped by grief of his young family’s death, your journey to break the cycle of crime will only lead Max further into the darkness and confrontation he has tried to avoid for so long. As both friend and foe make their play from the shadows and the stakes continue to be raised however, how far you are willing to push both the man and the city towards redemption is no longer for you to decide. Prepare for unforeseen consequences.  Best described as the equivalent of AC/DC’s Hells Bells, the core gameplay of the Max Payne series is some of the best yet seen in a shooter and, without a doubt, as stylish as the influences it wears so well. From leaping through the air with specks of debris trailing in your path as you clear out a room of enemies, to running and gunning your way through an entire building of psyched-up addicts, ‘satisfying’ doesn’t even begin to capture how incredible the mayhem is to experience. John Woo would be proud.With their only prior release in the form of a charming little DOS-based racer called Death Rally, the low-budget origins of Remedy’s classic continues to demonstrate just how inspired and creative a small team can be. Depicting such a dreary and seemingly hopeless world that often veers from poetic self-reflection to the downright comical is a testament to the love put into crafting the world and the developer’s skill as a whole.The series’ iconic cutscenes, (once home to Remedy’s friends and even Sam Lake himself), have taken more of a backseat this time around, favouring in-game rendering for most of the set pieces on offer. Admittedly, the transition between the two can be more jarring than usual when the graphic novel style is forced to cover through implication what the engine is unable to handle, but visually the game has held up admirably after all these years. Thanks to the higher production value, MP2 certainly isn’t bland and being transported into the depths of a dream sequence and Max’s tortured mind will quickly remind you of this, if the brilliantly moody soundtrack and fluid animation hasn't done so already.“Max, we gotta stop meeting like this.”Alongside the character of the city itself, Mona Sax is definitely the standout, with her well established femme fatale dynamic with Max carrying over from the first game. The excellent performances by Timothy Gibbs, Kathy Tong, James McCaffrey and Wendy Hoopes respectively deliver the top-notch voice acting alongside the equally stellar cast of both the new and returning characters. (Who could forget  or Lords and Ladies?)As one of the most fascinating and tragic relationships in gaming, the ultimately fatal attraction between the two characters is incredibly well-written, with such nuance stealing the show. Here’s looking at you, kid.The few complaints that I could make generally come down to uneven difficulty and some hilarious physics moments, but these are mostly negligible. The changes to bullet time might be considered sacrilege by some, but electing for a more fast-paced than methodical approach hasn't hurt combat in the slightest, with the sheer power of the many weapons on offer providing some of the best action of its time. MP2 is still quite short, but the clear and concise direction that it takes throughout redeems the amount of hours, particularly if you throw in some mods or a 'Dead on Arrival' run too. “I had a dream of my wife. She was dead. But it was all right.”Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is a remarkable achievement in nearly all aspects of its design and a worthy follow-up to the original, even more so when compared to the countless pale imitations or lifeless big budget titles that have emerged since. As masters of their craft, Remedy have more than fulfilled the series' goal of translating film noir alongside the impressive technical action and produced an enduring icon of the gaming industry.While not exactly a “joy” to experience, wake yourself up from the American Dream and embrace one of the best third-person shooters ever made. Thumbs up.			"

												Max Payne 2 came out eleven years ago so it seems odd to do a review of it. I'm sure that not exactly very many of you are going to be swayed to buy the game or anything like that. Yet I still want to recommend an absolutely fantastic mod that caught my eye for the game and I have been playing through. Payne Evolution takes a classic game and makes it even better by refining it with some of the features and improvements of Max Payne 3. Every gun is replaced by a new variant from Max Payne 3, new dialogue is is introduced when Max picks up painkillers (""I was self-medicating, like a good American"") and the MP3 bullet time effects are introduced. New sounds are added for so many things, of especially good quality being the new weapon sound effects. It really is a wholesale improvement on what was already an amazing game. Here is a link to the mod: http://www.moddb.com/mods/payne-evolutionI was surprised by just how much fun I had with the classic film-noir love story. The game holds up really well too in terms of aging. The revolutionary at the time physics and environmental interactivity is still really impressive. The level design is something else (it's really refreshing to have this big wide open level design to explore, in stark comparison to the heavily scripted nature of modern games) and the characterisation is strong. Like Max, you find yourself falling in love with Mona and hating Vlad just as much as he does. The dialogue is top-notch, with Max's brooding and dark outlook on life feeling a lot more original and fleshed out than Max Payne 3's lines. The comic book style presentation feels really unique too, a fine example of not so heavy-handed storytelling. The game at times made me miss some of the traits I associate with games in the days of yore, truth be told. The original game's excellence is further enhanced with the the brilliance of the Payne Evolution mod. Hell, if anything can vindicate that then probably the best moment is when the mod maker took inspiration (well, blatantly copied really) the song for for the final sequence of Max Payne 3, which is incredibly haunting and well fitting, and added it to the final sequence of Max Payne 2. If anything, it fits even better.

												Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is an action story driven game, created by Remedy Entertainment (Creators of Quantum Break and Alan Wake) and published by Rockstar Games. This game has a serious, dark noire and comic strip storyline feel which is the strongest aspect about Max Payne franchise, it's similar concept to Watchmen movie. The game sets after the predecessor's (Max Payne) timeline, causing Max Payne became a hard-boiled criminal. The graphics has been outdated in today's standards. The gameplay seems to be unique back in the day. Max Payne's franchise are known for a signature mechanic, ""Bullet Time"". Bullet time slows down time and pick off all targets with ease. There are some technical flaws about this game, the platform level design is frustrating me because I tried to jump from gap to gap and the character jumps vertically than leaping it but thank god you can use the dive animation to get another ledge. They don't have sort of objective marker because I don't know where I am supposed to go, so I have to back track the route once I have a key or easily get lost.+ Pros+ Dark, intriguing and plot-twist storyline with comic strip and noire feel+ Characters are interesting with excellent voice acting+ Bullet time+ Checkpoints or manual save system are generous+ More arsenals to kill with- Cons- Latest DirectX drivers are not supported.- Easy to get lost when trying to find a path, so backtrack is recommended like I do- Graphics are outdated in today's standardsFor this game's review, I recommend this game if you want to try it or one of those gamers who loves storytelling like myself. This is one of my favourite franchise to play because of the storyline and the bullet time. But I was really sad that this game is no longer supported with later DirectX drivers. This game doesn't disappoint outside technical issues. The final score is 9 out of 10, a solid recommendation. "

Max Payne 2: The Fall Of Max Payne			* 8/10A direct sequel for the tragedy of Max Payne.Back as a cop once again thanks to Senator Alfred Woden's influence, Max is following a case about a criminal gang disguised as cleaners. This new epsode will take us to old places, old friends and will uncover some dirty secrets. Gameplay follows the first max payne, a 3rd person view action with bullet time, and the story is told by Max with comic pages, as already happened before. One again the game is divided in 3 acts with chapters preceded by some prologue dream sessions.The dark noir atmosphere is always strong, with urban ambiences, old known locations such as the RagnaRock, and other new locations. Now levels are more articulated, details rich and filled with Sam Lake... I mean side stories disguised as Sam La... I mean, TV series. This might sound dumb or useless, but creating a world in a world helps in making it more real and credible.The engine is an improved and updated version of Max Payne's MaxFX, so now, besides a general graphic update, we can have real 3d face expressions in place of the old 2d flat faces. Too bad they're way less expressive now. Now the story isn't being told with comics alone but there are more scenes in-game, especially action scenes rendered and studied with a great direction as usual.Truth be told everything in this chapter is well done and studied, the story, plot twists, engine and gameplay. The problem is it doesn't innovate much the game as much as expected, as we'll mostly see characters and places from the previous title, and facts in the story will essentially be the same, or follow the same structure established in the first title. The only innovation lies in the fact we won't be playing as Max in a bunch of chapters, where we'll move a characters moving along with Max and catching up with him.Considering the age of this game it might give some minor troubles when you launch it, mainly incompatibilities with modern OSs (Such as Windows 10), which can be easily solved with compatibility mode. Another issue could be with integrated GPUs, it recognized my laptop's intel GPU but not my nVidia GPU. Luckily my Intel GPU was performing enough to handle MP2 maxed out at 90 FPS or more, so I didn't even had to try to force it to run with my nVidia.+++PROs+++ SEQUEL. A sequel of the first game worth its title, with the same good aspects such as bullet time, good plot, comics, updated engine and a great direction for cutscenes.---CONs--- SEQUEL. Unfortunately this sequel brings quality without innovation as gameplay and even the story, despite being well written and with plot twists, seems like a repeated formula from the first title. MINOR COMPATIBILITY ISSUES. The age of the game brings some minor compatibility issues such as forced windowed game, or unrecognized GPUs. Luckily none of them represent a serious issue and can be easily solved to play smoothly.I played this game on this machine:Laptop Lenovo Z50Intel Core i5-4210U8Gb RAM DDR3GeForce 840MIntel HD Graphics 4400Windows 10 Home x64 "

""When entertainment turns into a surreal reflection of your life, you're a lucky man if you can laugh at the joke. Luck and I weren't on speaking terms."" - Max Payne Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne - a noir love story.The ingredients list, the texture, the flavour, even the ending. What you get couldn't be more written on the tin if it tried. Which is both its selling point and its main detractor. As a game, it's excellent. The pacing is seamless, the mechanics responsive, the direction flawless. Where the first game gave you a tenuous dripfeed of bullettime, the sequel drowns you in it - each encounter usually ending in an invincible assault on wolves rendered sitting ducks as the sands of time become a suggestion and not a command - where even the default pistols quickly down the single enemy type, putting enough bullets in brains to say you're sharpening lead.On top of the quickly-recharging ""I Win"" meter, you have your spammable bullet-time dodge that doesn't use meter, but is balanced by the recovery frames meaning that you will die using it. It doesn't get used often.Weapons themselves are bog-standard. Pistols, rifles, shotguns, just about everything you could expect. It's never in danger of getting too inventive. A trait that plagues the game. The noir love story is fine, it's okay, it drives the game. But this was the sequel to Max Payne, the meta-deconstruction deliberate trainwreck that balanced insanity with quotable lines. Just about everything memorable about Max Payne 2's setting, details and dialogue is a direct reference to the permanent constipated grimace writing of the first game. It brings its own comparatively muted flavour to the table - you have optional TV shows that parody the game itself, along with a slurry of easter eggs and interactable objects. But every vestige of interest is shunted to the side like an unwanted child, a quality applicable to much of The Fall of Max Payne.""As surely as the bullet rips through the victim's flesh, organ and bone, it shatters the image of the man who presses the trigger."" - Max Payne The OST is fantastic, but only spikes up when it feels like it and tends to feel totally out of place, a trippy mix of tunes blasting while you're idly checking dead bodies for painkillers. The periods of calm between the firefights, where you're just wandering around interacting with stuff, don't wear out their welcome (especially compared to some of these recent games that slow you down to a crawl to compensate for that being their sole gameplay) but honestly there's not enough of them compared to the samey-looking construction rooms full of goons they're happy to throw at you.On the flipside, there's no real bossfights either. The one at the end is a physics puzzle. Combine the two and you have a game where neither the climactic moments nor the downtime manage to satisfy.There's a couple of points that are straight improvement over the first game. Especially in regards to compatibility - these days, Max Payne 1 is a bit of a chore to get running. Max Payne 2 looks better, runs better, and works straight out of the box. It's even compatible with the Steam Overlay, you don't see that often with games from the same era. Even difficulty-wise it's an absolute improvement - while the first game was all about abusing the coded accuracy drop while roll-strafing, the sequel lets you handle enemies with a whole lot more grace and style.Even if it does tend to come down to ""whoever lands a shot first wins"". Get used to savescumming if your reflexes are as bad as mine.Max Payne 2 is a great game worth playing. A noir love story that rides on the adrenaline-bloodlines of New York. Even if it does lose quite a bit of the magic from the first.""I had a dream of my wife.She was dead.But it was alright."" "

My Personal Score: 3/5PCGamingWiki Page[pcgamingwiki.com]Issues: none experienced during playthroughsMax Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne improves on everything which made the first game great and even surpasses it in some aspects. The gameplay isn't as awkward as before thanks to improved hitboxes and bullet trajectories, a sense of realism surrounds the game because of physics simulations like ragdoll effects, and the identity of the series has been given a new facelift thanks to higher production values. Overall, an excellent action game that's worthy of the Max Payne name and fans will be happy with this installment. However, if you're new to the series or have only played the Rockstar-made entry, you won't get as much from this game and everything will just look like a confusing mess. Max Payne 2 is a story-centric game and it builds on what fans and players of the first game already knows. This time around, the true intentions of the first game's major players are shown and reveals a new side to them, making them more believable rather than being a one-sided cliche of a character. The story focuses on Max after the events of the first title as he reflects on his past choices and how he copes up with the decisions that he's made. I highly suggest that new players play the first game or watch a recap video because without knowledge of the characters' background and the events leading up to this game, the story becomes much less impactful and you won't get much out of it because of its focus on the cast rather than plot.Improvements that I've noticed:1. Better voice actors than the first game and their performances are consistent except for some select moments.2. The new soundtrack is great, especially ""Late Goodbye"" by Poets of The Fall which is featured prominently in the game.3. Still linear but bigger levels with the inclusion of optional explorable rooms make it seem less so.4. Very serious story with comedic undertones. Sam Lake and Remedy somehow managed to make the virtual enemies that you're killing appear human in nature rather than just fodder that blocks your way. They laugh, they share jokes and share experiences with their friends, they also play the piano real good - very small details delivered in a very funny way but it still makes a lot of difference for the personal story that they're presenting to the player.And there you have it.

												""The Fall of Max Payne"". Funny, I don't remember there ever being a ""Rise of Max Payne"". These games are about a man who lost everything, there was never a rise...was there? Sometime in-between completing Max Payne 1 and the sequel, I finally watched John Woo's The Killer. While a classic in its own right due to the intense shoot-outs, I was especially impressed by its usage of tragedy. Ah Jong is an assassin, but he has morals and a sense of honor. Early on in the film, he accidentally blinds Jennie - a nightclub singer - during a hired hit. Thus, he takes on one last job. The reward would be used for Jennie's vision-saving operation. However, Jong is betrayed by his superiors. (SPOILERS)Over the course of the movie, Ah Jong befriends and eventually partners with Inspector Li Ying. Before the climatic battle, Jong asks Ying to promise that if/when he dies, his corneas be used to save Jennie's eyesight. So even if worst came to worst, Jennie could hopefully return to a normal life.  Unfortunately, in the last minutes of the movie, he's shot in the eyes by the villain. Before Jong succumbs to his wounds, he can hear Jennie's cries. Due to their blindness, neither of them can find one another, despite being just a few feet apart. Not only does Jong die, but his noble sacrifice is denied. Everything he worked (and killed) for over the course of the movie was for naught. Although Ying survives, he has lost good friends, and becomes disillusioned with the concept of justice. Shortly after starting a new game in Max Payne 1, you're treated to the horrifying deaths of Max's wife and child. As time passes, he is framed for murder, wipes out half the criminal underworld, and develops an addiction to painkillers. However, if you've played through the game, then you can recall the final lines: ""Woden grinned smugly. It was the grin of a winner. That made two of us."" Max Payne is a winner. He succeeded in his mission of vengeance. For us, the audience, that's a satisfying end. So in its own way, Max Payne 1 chronicled the rise, so now we must witness the fall. Tragedy isn't just when a person dies, it's also when their hopes, dreams, and emotions are extinguished.All that said, there is a lot of joy to be found in Max Payne 2. It's a twisted game, one that isn't afraid to poke fun at itself. This sense of humor keeps the game from coming off as overly dour. It feels especially rewarding to fans of the first title, because they'll pick up on all of the references. It's the kind of humor that fits the tone of the story. It's dark and depressing, but it also has a very distinct noir quality to it. Everything is interconnected, and you get the sense that Max might just be a small part of a much larger story. The ""TV shows"" that can be seen in various points of the game are a reflection of this. MP2 is a little shorter than its predecessor, but there's more imagery to absorb in every scene.As for the actual videogame, I believe the combat mechanics are a marked improvement over the first entry. The concept hasn't changed much. You run through every level shooting all of the bad guys. Where this game differs is it showcases a bit more nuance, and a higher level of confidence. One of the first notable changes is that Max takes less damage. This brings it more in-line with the John Woo movies, where good guys shrug off bullets. A couple shot-gun blasts are still usually enough to bring Max from very healthy to dead, but occasional stray shots don't take large chunks of life either. This change gives Remedy a little more freedom when designing encounters. They're more involved, and there tends to be more memorable situations. Max Payne 1 was compelling enough even when combat was just ""room full of thugs"". The sequel changes things up, and it works very well. I don't even hate the escort missions, well...maybe I still hate them a little. These sections run parallel with some interesting and amusing ideas, so I guess I'll let them slide.While I'm not sure if I can attribute this to experience with the prequel, or actual changes, the ""bullet-time"" system also feels substantially better. When Max slows everything down, his heightened reflexes really come into their own. It's really fun running into an area, triggering the bullet-time, and wasting everyone. The first enemy is still flying through the air from Max's shotgun blast as he kills two more men in rapid succession. Occurences such as this are always welcome. Max also pulls off some sweet reloads while in bullet-time. One other minor but welcome change is that when diving and shooting, Max can continue firing while lying on the ground, until his clip is empty. This game uses Havok physics, but the enemies are properly weighted. This makes it so that kills carry some semblance of realism to them, but the few times where enemies soar, or get knocked around in massive explosions, are still very amusing.On the surface, MP2 comes off as the easier game, but it's balanced out by more thoughtful encounters and harrowing situations. There's a bit more creativity to throw around, and hopefully it keeps players from hitting F5/F9 so much (no guarantees though). Unlike the first game, there is a distinct lack of ""boss enemies"" aka ""thugs who take a lot more bullets to kill"". I consider this another positive. Also, just when you really think you've got it down, there are still more difficulties and extra modes to explore. Don't forget to look for the minor details, like people complaining when you stand in-front of them, while they're trying to watch TV.Basically, if you played through the first Max Payne, you're required to check out the sequel. It's a phenomenal game, and features some of the best third-person shooting action around. The story is fantastic as well, and MP2's usage of various interactive elements really sells the ""games-as-art"" idea. Oh and don't forget the wide-screen fix.			"

You have to create a text document in the game's install folder, open it, write this: ""start /affinity 1 MaxPayne2.exe"", save it, modify it's extention to "".bat"" and use this file to open up the game.

												Hi! so, first of all, I just want to say sorry for my english, tho I really want to give my opinion about this game. ITS EXCELENT. This must be one of the best games I ever playd in my entire life. It might not have the best graphics, but it sure have a very good, sad and dramatic story that makes you have so much feelings for the good and for the bad in the entire game. its sure short, I have to admit... the first game took me like 2 hrs to finish and the the second around 3 hrs... but together those were 5 hrs of being around drama all the time and just concentrate in getting closer and closer to figgur out who is Max Payne, his personality and his life story.... about the gameplay, ITS FREAKING AWESOME! The movement in this game, the skills of the main character and everything is just perfect. being abale to play with almost every kind of weapon you can think about and do some cool tricks with the character, one of them is just make the time slower and you can hear only your heart beats and bullets droping to the ground after you shot... which is very very cool! I dont think I can add anything else... I kind of clear my opinion about this game. so go a head and buy it on the next sale.. trust me, you want to play this game!			"

												It was almost morning, waking up from the American Dream. We are willing to suffer, to die for the things we care about. For love, for the right choices, Because of her, I had solved the case. My case. All of it. Story Two years after the events of the previous game, Max Payne is a NYPD detective. Senator Alfred Wooden has kept his promise, and released Max from his history of violence. Max got back to working for the NYPD to keep himself busy in life. After a series of events, Max investigates a group of contract killers called: The Cleaners. Mona Sax, who was presumed dead, is under investigation for killing Senator Gates, a member of ""The Inner Circle"" from the previous game. The leader of the Russian mob, and Max's old friend Vladimir Lem, finds himself in a heavy mob war with Vinnie Gognitti. Max is determined to find out about the unexpected return from Max's love interest Mona Sax, and who The Cleaners are working for, and what they want. Gameplay Max Payne 2 plays very similar to its first installment. The new and polished bullet-time is back, and better than ever. The animations of the bullet-time just look better, and the bullet-time diving won't lower your stamina bar. The game has like its previous installment 3 parts, each with seven to nine chapters. Next to playing Max, you'll also play as Mona Sax for a few chapters, making the characters bond together even better. There are more guns to choose from, and are in my opinion far more fun to use. Conclusion Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is in my opinion a better game than Max Payne 1. It has one of the best game stories I've ever played, and it takes a few nice twists and turns. The gameplay is amazing and fun to play, and still plays a lot like Max Payne 1. That being said, the only bit of negativity I have for the game, is that it's really short. An average gamer completes the game in six or seven hours. But the story fits perfectly in this time span, nothing needs to be added or left out. But a little bit more time to walk around and shoot is never a bad thing. Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is a phenomenal game, nothing more I can say about it. 9.5/10  "

												Max Payne 2 is such a perfect sequel that I almost find it difficult to recommend it without playing May Payne 1 directly before it. Both games offer complete stories, but Remedy has filled the game with details that link back to the first game in such a way that the two games feel like one single package. Max Payne 2 improves arguably every aspect of the game, bringing the graphics to more modern standards and refining the gameplay by making Max more responsive and improving his bullet time abilities. If you're only going to play one game in the series I would break my vow of playing every series in order and say to go with this one because it's just such a great game, but even if you can't get into Max Payne 1's older gameplay it's worth seeing it through just to be able to appreciate this game even a little bit more.

												Max Payne 2 offers pretty much identical gameplay to the first one. Graphics are better, but nothing to gawk over. At first glance it turned out to be more of a been there, done that type of game. It really doesn't offer anything new or innovative over the original. The one interesting piece was the tie in of a second character and being able to play certain events from the eyes of both. But it did feel a little awkward not playing as Max Payne the whole way.Like the first game, the AI is overly difficult, even on easy, which kills much of the enjoyment. Precise aim combined with unbelievable reaction times and pre-firing around corners. QuickSave is pretty much your best friend. Overall, I didn't hate it, but I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as the first one either.			"

												Not as groundbreaking as the 1st, but nonetheless a worthy sequel that holds up just fine today gameplay wise despite being released more than a decade ago. You'll need to apply the widescreen patch and in case your native resolution is not showing up in the launcher options, just change the display device and you should be able to select it. Definitely play the 1st one first though.			"

												This is much better than the original as you can regain slow-mo bullet time when waiting or resting, but most importantly, it contains more of your favourite weapons, especially if you were disappointed that the MP5 and AK47 weren't in the original. And the story line is more interesting as it contains more of Max's love life. So yes, buy this game and you be surprised on what else this game features!			"

												My favourite game on steam :) It's one of those nostalgic old games you really want in your old games collection, I myself have such games as Gta 3, Max Payne , NOLF, Mafia , Reservoir Dogs, True Crime , State of Emergency, Scarface and maany many others in my ""Nostalgic old games collection"" Yes its a teeny tiny little collection of those games I used to play years ago and they got this weird nostalgic feel to them when I got to play them again. This is one of those games. It really makes me want to watch F.R.I.E.N.D.S. again for some reason that I do not know... Same with GTA 3... Really odd... Probably just because of New York :D (Yes Liberty City seems like New York to me.)Anyway the game is great, it has some  awesome voice acting, great conversations between NPCs (Some are pretty hilarious) The death animations/Body physics in the game are pretty cool for such an old game. It has a pretty decent story also and it has a lot of replayability in my opinion that is ;)9.5/10			"

												Max Payne 2 is the sequel to the first Max Payne game (One of the best PC games of it's time).Max Payne 2 is truly an improvment over the first one.Max is back as the titular character and so are the voices.This time he is working for the NYPD and investigating murders where Mona Sax (read fatal attraction) makes an appearence and all hell breaks loose which isn't surprising for our guy Max, after all he has a knack for finding trouble.The iconic bullet time is back with elan, it is done with much more panache and feels tight as ever.The gameplay is just top notch, gunfights feel solid and and the game nails the definite thumping sound for each weapon.Max Payne 2 is the successor to one of the best PC games of it's decade and yet it improves on it.You cant ask for much more, grab Max Payne 1 and 2 instead of 3 (piece of turd) for the real Max Payne experience.

═══════════════════════════════════OVERVIEW Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is a third-person action shooter made by Rockstar Games, the developers of Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, Bully and many more. You follow the story of Max Payne, a former DEA agent for the New York City Police Department who has trouble keeping up with his life. You will need to fight trough loads of enemies using many available weapons and skills such as slow motion. The game features 3 difficulties; Detective - Enemies and health spawns adapt you, Hard Boiled - Enemies are harder and painkillers spawn rarely, Dead On Arrival - Same as Hard Boiled but with limited saves. There are also 2 bonus difficulties; New York Minute where you need to complete the level as fast as possible and Dead Man Walking where you fight enemies in arena until you die. The game takes around 8 hours to beat depending on what difficulty you took. I really recommend buying this game, you can get it for 2.49€ or for 2.99€ in a great Max Payne 1+2 pack on sale. ═══════════════════════════════════PROS & CONS Pros:Fun | You will want to replay this game sooner or laterAwesome Game Mechanics | Side jumping and slow-mo make this game even better, the fact that you can do things actors do in one of those action movies makes me redo levels just so I can experience that againAddicting Soundtrack | This game has one of the best soundtracks, Main Theme is my personal favorite.Cons:Fullscreen doesn't work on Windows 7 and later | You can fix this by opening task manager, setting it to More Details, using a dropdown arrow on Max Payne process, selecting the process and using option Maximize. If that doesn't work Google is your friend.Confusing Story | I played the game few times and I still can't catch the story which really frustrates me.Dumb AI | NPCs will often fail to do simple tasks or they will just run in gunfire by themselves═══════════════════════════════════SUMMARY & FINAL RATING This game is for everyone that likes action shooters. I rate the game 8/10, would accidentally slow-mo myself from a building again! ═══════════════════════════════════For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!

												Max Payne 2 The Fall of Max Payne is one of those games that people hate and love. On the one hand you have the multitudes who proclaim that it's noir style is completely groundbreaking and that the storytelling stands in a league of it's own. On the other hand you have the many who say that it's nothing more than hype and that at it's core Max Payne 2 is nothing more than an average shooter enticing the wannabe artsy gamers with a pseudo-deep story and pretty cinematic. You can never tell who's right in an argument like this, both sides will provide equal parts well-thought counterpoints and nonsensical fanatical rantings.Me, I really liked it. Sure the story is not as great as some proclaim but it's not the giant pile of lice infested feces that others call it. And yeah it's not 1930's French movie either but lets be honest, whether you like those kind of movies or not they'd never work as a game, the pacing is completely different.What saves the game for me is the simple fact that the gameplay is nice and solid. The shooting is fast and meaty and the slow motion gimmick that the original Max Payne brought forth to the masses still works well enough that it doesn't bother me as much as it does in other games. Now there is a mechanic that got overused in later games.There is a reason Max Payne is a name many gamers know. Beyond the story, the pretentious artsy cut scenes and all the posturing is some good and solid gameplay, and that's hard to ignore.			"

Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max PayneI lied to myself that it was over. I was still alive, my loved ones were still dead. It wasn't over.General OverviewFiring a gun is a binary choice. You either pull the trigger or you don't... Max Payne has been taken by the police and is about to face charges for his killing spree. However, he is cleared of all charges, thanks to his relationship with a very influential member of society, Senator Alfred Woden. A few years have passed, and Max has returned to work for the NYPD as a homicide detective. During a routine murder investigation he finds himself face-to-face with the fugitive Mona Sax, a woman he thought was dead. Max and Mona team up to solve the answers to Max's past that left his wife and child dead.My Own ViewsAn incredible leap in gameplay and graphics just 1 year after the release of the first game. The story does not dissapoint. Starting off with the cleaners and finding out Mona is alive (Its not a spoiler its on the game description) dealings with the inner circle and Alfred Woden. Meeting people from the first game, Vladimir Lem & Vinnie Gognitti. Leading up to a massive climax, dark and gritty as in the first.This time the gunplay and bullet time is far superior and you get to play as Mona as well. Certain missions you play both in alternating sequence to get to the goal.James McCaffrey reprises his role as Max and the superb poetic and dark monolougue continues.One other point about this game. It basically introduced the world to Poet's of the fall with their song Late Goodbye. If you like your Scandinavian rock/metal (I do \m/) check these guys out for some lighter rock. Late goodbye can be heard throughout the game from a janitor humming as he cleans, to a cleaner playing it on a grand piano right before (most people blow him up with a grenade) and of course the final credits.One of my favourite PC shooters of all time.Freerider-DaveThe past is a gaping hole. You try to run from it, but the more you run, the deeper, more terrible it grows behind you, its edges yawning at your heels. Your only chance is to turn around and face it. But it's like looking down into the grave of your love. Or kissing the mouth of a gun, a bullet trembling in its dark nest, ready to blow your head off. "

												This is one of those kind of rare games that ""I keep coming back"", one of the key elements of this game is immersion, every level and its attention to detail is amazing, although the level design is most of times a straight line it never gets boring. I think the core of this game is just absorbing every element of the story of this psychology thriller, like a simple tour in a heavy gritty mind of a man. That funhouse level is a perfect example that illustrates this, we simple run through this crazy madhouse fictionally inspired by a fictional tvshow inside the game, these elements try to be realistic in a way that they affect the character and complement the complexity of that fictional Noir York City. I come back to this game not because of the shooting or bullet time but because of the nightmarish feel it always leave me, the characters we interact with always seem crazy, strange and distant. The TVshows always feel like a omen of bad things to come or a satire of Max's life. Technically the physics were pretty good for it's time and the game was released with tools from the developer, something rare nowadays, so there are plenty of mods out there even total conversions. Lots of game interaction, sound design, music, everything, everything in this game was polished and worked. Great game should be preserved! culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant!

												One of the best 3rd person games to have emerged out of the 2000s.  The plot, acting, characters, voice acting and gameplay mechanics are amazing to play even a decade later.The flim noir feel to this game coupled with the hammy lines and gritty New York scene make the plot memorable and enjoyable. The landscapes, sounds, soundtrack, layout and even odd and slightly macabre portraits of the cut outs in the game make for an overally gloomy, moody and atmospheric game. The bullet-time mechanics make this a pleasure to play as you hammer away with your twin deagles in bullet-time mode.What's also really enjoyable are the game's idiosyncrasies: the Lords and Ladies television show that everyone watches with its overly hammy and campy acting; the strung out junkies and hookers who decide to join you only to last several minutes; or the old ladies who toss you a spare shotgun from their living room closet.The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful and haunting with that repeating cello and accompanying orchestra. The first Max Payne introduced the gamer to bullet-time mechanics along with an equally gritty plot copuled with Max's foray into his drug-addled dreamscapes while looking for his family's killers.In the sequel, the graphics have been updated along with a continuation of the plot. I love what Remedy has done with both games. With the third Max Payne, you are granted access to way better graphics, thanks to Rockstar, but frankly the plot paled in comparison with the previous two releases.They don't make games like these anymore...10/10			"

The story feels less deep, less dramatic and not as complex as the first game.I do recommend this game, because the gameplay is just fantastic, the bullet time is better than in the first game and I just love feeling overpowered and shooting loads of bad guys in cool action sequences.Story: 6/10Gameplay: 9/10			"

												Max Payne 2 is a solid sequel to the original Max Payne (which I highly suggest you play if you haven’t yet had the opportunity). Unlike the original however, this version is totally playable in its current state without any modifications. Back in 2003 I felt the story fell flat in comparison to the first game but on my most recent playthroughs I’ve really come to appreciate its place in the Max Payne universe. Even if you’re not into the story, pretty much all the mechanics are noticeably improved from the original while still maintaining the classic Max Payne feel. At this point the game is over a decade old so it isn’t the most beautiful thing to look at, but it’s still a great shooter with a deep story and fun, rewarding gameplay.			"

												Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is... A Deserving Sequel to the Original!I reviewed the first game and I mentioned that due to the structure of the game it really doesn't age too badly. This title is the same, its aged like a fine whiskey and plays like a charm. The shooting is tighter, the locations are bigger and the bullet time is executed perfectly. The story is strong, and this is key point. Remedy did a fantastic job with MP1 by creating a dark world of mystery burdened with mafia style shootouts, and this game really comes through and supports that by bringing back the characters and filling them out further. The killer question, is it worth a purchase? Yes. Pick it up for less than £5 and you've got a steal. It came out in an era where single player games had to be long to do well, and although it picked up criticism for being too short, its a breath of fresh air compared to some current day releases.NotesNo Steam Achievements, No Trading Cards, No Controller Support.

												It's hard to believe that Max Payne 2 came out over seven years ago. This remains one of the best third person action games ever. The first one was also good but BRUTALLY difficult at points, and Max's hilariously constipated face made for great times, but part 2--pardon the pun--remedies whatever flaws the first one had. Aside from a graphical upgrade, they changed the bullet-time mechanics to basically be Cyborg 009's acceleration mode. As one of the first games to use Havok physics aka ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ physics"" in conjunction with ragdoll effects, the gunfights always looked and felt unique.The other great thing about Max Payne 2 that hasn't really been explored since is the ongoing meta-narratives explored by overhearing radio broadcasts and television. A lot of it is referential to the first game, but several of the tales serve as ""Shadow Play Girls"" / ""Tales of the Black Freighter""-esque parallels to existing developments.PS: beat it on Hardest and the ending's a bit different...

Gameplay is improved a lot though, so it has that going for it, easier (you can take more damage) and ragdoll physics for the enemies make it much more playable and fun to play.Still only manual saves which like the first every so often leads to frustration.(also horrendous endboss battle, both for understanding what the game wants you to do and what you actually have to do, very unsatisfying)Overall I dont find it an all that great product: 7/10			"

												MAX PAYNE 2:A FILM NOIR LOVE STORYOne of the most beautiful, engrossing, atmospheric and entertaining games I've ever had the pleasure of playing.Max Payne 2 is the story of a long and dark night in which the tortured Max Payne struggles to find the answers to the questions he's been asking himself ever since his family was murdered, leaving a stream of bodies and bullets in his wake. Encapsulated by the love he feels for the mysterious Mona Sax, Max finds himself fighting for justice alongside a criminal; struggling to find the light in a world of darkness and pain.Gameplay is a frantic and elegant ballet of gunfire, carving a path through a storm of enemies in a variety of urban environments, exposing you to the dark side of New York City and other unique locations in a fantastically detailed manner.Use your instincts to make it through insanely fast firefights and vanquish your foes through a huge arsenal.All the while, Max Payne details the sorrows, the doubts, the fears that he has and the bizzare and saddening nature of his life and the realities shared by so many people - impeccably noir and exquisitely dark dialogue leaves you with lines that will stun you the moment you hear them.Max Payne 2 is completely and utterly brilliant.Cheap as chips and worth playing over and over again.TL;DR - Address Unknown is the best show ever.

												When it comes to a game based on running and guning, many games give you a character who's happy to kill.  Max Payne, on the other hand, wants it to stop.  With a dark story, you play as a detective who runs from their past, trying to avoid it at all costs, and ends up with no choice but to face it.  You fallow a character hounted by his past, and tries to put it behind him with painkillers.If you are looking for a game with a dark theme, and interasting order of events, and a character like no other, this is a game for you.  I enjoyed the fact that the seconed game picked up from where the first game left off.  All around a dark and well put together story.			"

												 I LOVE THIS GAME.I LOVE THIS GAME.I LOVE THIS GAME.I LOVE THIS GAME.I LOVE THIS GAME.Emg emh.If you saw/read my Max Payne 1 review you'll see that I praised the game for pretty much everything and didn't say much bad about it at all, it's as if the game had no flaws at all and din't need any more improvements.And then Max Payne 2 came a long, also known as THE BEST THIRD PERSON GAME EEEVEEER!!111Everything has been improved, I have said that the soundtrack of MP1 was top-notch, which it was, don't get me wrong, but there was not much of it. Many times in MP1 you'll run around without any music in the background. MP2 not only offers more of it but also its soundtrack pretty much suits any situation perfectly, always. MP2 also changed Max Payne's theme slightly, in my opinion this is the best version of it. The story this time is larger, epic. And its presentation is better than in MP1 if you can even believe that. The comics look much better with professional actors this time around, in MP1 Remedy had to work with what they've got, which I think you've noticed with many goofy looking faces which could be distracting in some parts. Now with bigger budget they have managed to create something truly amazing. Nothing seems weird or odd anymore, Max Payne's smirk also has been removed replaced with a ._. face . I promise you, you will get teary eyed or even cry at the ending. It is that powerful. Meanwhile MP1's story was about revenge, MP2 is about love. MP2 counties to also go deeper into Payne's psyche. Nightmares return and they're not frustrating as before, they are not as creepy, but their presentation is much superior.Throughout the game you can interact with your surroundings, watch TV shows which are still frames, true. But their stories are still strangely engaging or just interesting and it is fun to watch them. You've got♥♥♥♥♥♥Justice for example, a parody of MP1's story and Max Payne's character in general. Lords and Ladies, a parody of soap operas. There are much more of them and they're completely optional.Graphics looks really good, even today you'll have no problem with it, in that case this game has dated much better than the game that came before it. Except good models for the main characters and some good environment graphics all around.Gunplay has been improved; oh it has been improved so much. Just the fact the game has radgolls now! It's so cool! You'll kill a dude and he'll fly away and then and then Max will do this cool spinning thing and the game follows it OH MY GOD IT'S SOO GOOOD!....Let me elaborate.Bullet time and shoot-dodge return and there are slight tweaks to them.Bullet-time now works in a slightly different way, when you start it up the bullet-time it doesn’t seem to slow down as much as it did in the MP1, that is until you kill an enemy. Each time you kill an enemy with Bullet-Time the game slows down more. And when you are forced to reload Max does this spinning move which looks really awesome and doesn't leave you to harm for so long, the move reloads your weapon very quickly. Shoot-dodge has been unchanged for the most part, now the shoot-dodge just doesn't take any bullet time away from you, but you can get harmed and even die while you're performing it. You're no longer invincible as you were in the first game.There are more weapons too and they all feel better to use.The game's difficulty is much more balanced; there are no frustrating cheap deaths which you might have experienced in the first game.When you complete the game you get ""Dead Man Walking mode"" it's a mode where you are putted into a map from campaign, your quest is to stand and fight as long as you can until you die, you can try to beat your time-limit, it is quite fun and addicting and if you enjoy the gunplay as much as I do it's amazing.The game is on a shorter side, shorter than the first game actually. But does that matter? The game's awesome!11/10, Better than best game ever made, buy it, buy it. Come on, do it. "

												A cinematic, action packed swarm of near perfection with a tragically twisting plot worthy of the big screen.The gritty, film noir storytelling, intense bullet time action sequences and painstaking attention to detail in every area make Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne a must-have for every action fan.The action in Max Payne 2 is as adrenaline-pumping as anything you'd see on the silver screen, and you're in control. Or dangerously close to spiraling out of control, as Max often is. Despite the length, this is top-quality entertainment.			"

												Gameplay-wise Max Payne 2 is just more of the same from Max Payne 1. In fact, anything I have to say in this review is more of the same. I didn't notice any kind of upgrades with regards to enemy AI, all my previous gripes still apply. I still like the story though, the noir continues unabated from the first. The one thing I have to add is that by the end of this game Payne's story arc gets full closure. I'll be moving on to the next installment after this but I'm interested to see what it could be about because #2 ends neatly for all concerned.			"

												Expands upon the original in nearly every way. Intense, fun, and sometimes touching. 9/10+Looks quite good for a game from 2003+Just as well written as the first+Another set of great vocal performances+The scenes in the funhouse are really cool!+The villain, yet again, feels underdeveloped+The 2nd game has its own, unique, slow-mo mechanic where you move at normal speed, but with every kill you get, time slows more and more for the enemies and the enviroment. I personally like this quite a bit more than 1/3's more traditional slow mo.+A great central romance that is shown just as much though gameplay as in diologue.+A perfect ending (despite the shoddy boss that preceded it)-The first level set in the Ragranok club from the first game was nice, but it starts to feel cheap when you take a level design that was already recycled, and use it ANOTHER TIME!-The scenes when you play as Mona feel unneccisary-The game is a bit on the short side, I beat it in about 4 hours, and I am dreadful at it.(Steam only shows me as having an hour or so in game, in reality I have about 4. I mostly played through this while my internet was down)			"

												When it comes to a game based on running and guning, many games give you a character who's happy to kill.  Max Payne, on the other hand, wants it to stop.  With a dark story, you play as a detective who runs from their past, trying to avoid it at all costs, and ends up with no choice but to face it.  You fallow a character hounted by his past, and tries to put it behind him with painkillers.If you are looking for a game with a dark theme, and interasting order of events, and a character like no other, this is a game for you.  I enjoyed the fact that the seconed game picked up from where the first game left off.  All around a dark and well put together story.			"

												MAX PAYNE 2:A FILM NOIR LOVE STORYOne of the most beautiful, engrossing, atmospheric and entertaining games I've ever had the pleasure of playing.Max Payne 2 is the story of a long and dark night in which the tortured Max Payne struggles to find the answers to the questions he's been asking himself ever since his family was murdered, leaving a stream of bodies and bullets in his wake. Encapsulated by the love he feels for the mysterious Mona Sax, Max finds himself fighting for justice alongside a criminal; struggling to find the light in a world of darkness and pain.Gameplay is a frantic and elegant ballet of gunfire, carving a path through a storm of enemies in a variety of urban environments, exposing you to the dark side of New York City and other unique locations in a fantastically detailed manner.Use your instincts to make it through insanely fast firefights and vanquish your foes through a huge arsenal.All the while, Max Payne details the sorrows, the doubts, the fears that he has and the bizzare and saddening nature of his life and the realities shared by so many people - impeccably noir and exquisitely dark dialogue leaves you with lines that will stun you the moment you hear them.Max Payne 2 is completely and utterly brilliant.Cheap as chips and worth playing over and over again.TL;DR - Address Unknown is the best show ever.

												Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is the kick♥♥♥♥♥sequel that continues the story from the original game. The graphics and physics engine have been upgraded and polished which leads to very satisfying action gameplay. The game continues the bullet-time feature which leads to some awesome gunfights and allows you to land those precise headshots. The story is a good as ever and the story telling remains the same as a graphic novel. If you enjoyed the first game then you will enjoy the second game even more. The length of the story is about the same as the orignal game, around 7-8 hours - I wish the game was longer because it's just too good!			"

												An interesting sequel that had a more dramatic tone than its predecessor. Many people dislike it due to that but the game is still heavy with action-packed sequences, therefore, I believe there is no need to downgrade this one.Mona, the girl Max encounters, becomes an essential part of the story and you can control her in a few levels. Max has not changed a lot - bullet time is still important and is very useful to complete the levels. This game was a milestone in video gaming at that time - I believe it was one of the first games utilising the Havok engine; seeing how the eliminated enemies fall down and hitting objects was jaw dropping in 2004.I do not know why Valve did not upload more pictures or a couple of gameplay videos. You should check some on YouTube then you can easily make up your mind to pick this one up if it receives a discount. It certainly aged a lot so playing it after the 3rd episode might turn you away, still, I recommend giving it a try.			"

												More enjoyable than Max Payne 1. Shorter, but sweeter. More room for failure, a couple hits doesn't mean you need to spam painkillers or quick load, and you're able to fire off more rounds in bullet time and can continue firing on your stomach after bullet time ends, meaning there's no awkward second of having to stand up while the enemy is still pointing guns at you. I really enjoyed the graphic novel and noir themes to this game, and the dark humor was what gave life to this bleak world.Four out of five Lennys( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( )			"

												Max Payne 2 is a direct sequel to the original and picks up after the events of that game. Max, now a detective and wearier than ever of the world, once again has his hands full as he finds himself hopelessly attached to the lovely Mona Sax, a murder suspect and part of a bigger plot that ties in to Max's own dark past. There are tons of references and parallels to the original story. Fans will undoubtedly be pleased by some of the nudging and winking, though someone starting off with Max Payne 2 would probably feel rather left out, despite the presence of an optional cutscene that summarizes what happened leading up to Max Payne 2. Still, this is a surprisingly complex narrative for a game, irrespective of the genre.The storyline unfolds in much the same fashion as the original. It uses some very slick, graphic novel-style storyboards--complete with melodramatic dialogue straight out of a pulp detective novel--and good voice-over to go with it. These graphic novel sequences are unmistakably similar to those of the first game, though they are, in some cases, even more artistic this time around. Max Payne 2 certainly isn't lacking in its presentation. Even the game's special edition DVD-style packaging is slick, and all of the game's between-level loading screens and graphic novel sequences are impressive-looking and often very cool. The plot itself features a number of twists but is rather convoluted the first go-round. Play through the game a second time (perhaps on the higher difficulty setting that's unlocked after you finish it the first time) and you'll likely get a much clearer sense of what's happening.			"

												Back in the early 2000's I didn't expect Max Payne to have a sequel as fast as Max Payne 2 appeared on the magazines and then on sale. This game took me by surprise and it was a good one. Of course the first game will always be the best one but Max Payne 2 improve gameplay wise a few things. This Steam version has a few fixes for resolution and new OS. They work great so don't hesitaste about getting the whole Max Payne collection (preferible for christmas on a snowy or rainy weekend!) "

												A great sequel to an already great game. Max Payne 2 doesn't add much to the original formula, but little improvements here and there to the gameplay makes this game even more fluid and fun to play. The story is just as great, the graphics are better and the music a bit cooler for me. The length is roughly the same, with the same modes of the original and now you can also freely select the chapter you want to play. If you enjoyed the original Max Payne, you'll enjoy this one a little more, and you won't be disappointed.			"

												Max Payne 2 continues to deliver.Lots of similiarities to the first game, with benefits of better graphics and gunplay. I felt the Bullettime took a hit though, and was not nearly as slow as the previous game.It's worth it, and I bought this from a Humble Bundle. !!!!IMPORTANT NOTE!!!!: This game tends to not start up on new operating systems. For mine, (Win 7), I had to go into the game's .exe file's properties and set the compatability mode to Win 98.			"

												The game features an excellent story line that might as well have been used in a film noir. All of the main characters of the first instalment (except of course those who died) are back and there are a lot of nice cut sequences (which can get annoying if you have to reload too often). Also the game elements are a lot more varied, you meet people in the street, and they will give you a hand in the level. And then there’s the story line, quite possibly the best part of the game, its deep, and it really makes you think. Every element has been well thought out, the only two criticism are the very short game, and the fact that the level design is slightly too linear, there’s only one way through.			"

												Fantastic game! I absolutely adore the love story of this game, it worked so nicely and it was... a masterpiece. This game was fantastic and improved on Max Payne 1 in ABSOLUTELY every way! While it was shorter than Max Payne 1, clocking in at around 6 hours, (while MP1 was around 10 hours) I still thoroughly loved my experience and finished it in 1 day. Gunplay is very fun, and the story goes really really deep, but not as ""Illuminati"" deep as Max Payne 1. Graphics have aged very well, the soundtrack was good for the most part, and it was QUITE the experience, I can tell you that! A blast to play through, and a solid run for your money. Get it!

												Slicker and smoother than the first game, it polishes off a lot of the rough edges while telling a new and equally brutal story just as dramatic as the previous one. The shooting feels excellent and cinematic in a way that many modern games still fail to replicate, It's still as fundamentally simple as the previous one, involving lots of bad guys, guns, ammo, and painkillers, but it has a little more heart and a little less frustration than before. Max is as appealing of a haunted protagonist as ever, and somehow even more badass in this one, and the overall story is pulpy, dramatic deliciousness for someone who eats up this kind of style. It also has some impressive mod support! Worth checking out for sure.			"

												This goes quite cheap when a sale comes through, and while it may not have the stylized ""experience"" for slow-down effects that many newer games have, it still maintains one of the most glorified renditions of it as a feature catalyst.  That being the ""arcadey"" presence and experience you can get from playing almost all of it. The story telling is phenomenal - was and still is some of the best character development, art style, plot mechanization, and acting that could be asked for in a game.  As true to form as it can be, it never shys from the brutality, edge, misfortune, or emotional futility - wherein you hope for the best and expect the inevitable worst - that one could ask for in a ""noir"" experience.Again, the real treat that sets MP2 off as one of the most important games of modern years is the intensity that can come from it once you allow yourself to get absorbed in this ""world"" - in the mind of the characters and the empathy of their emotions and actions.  The drive to experience the rest of their story to the end, to start a level and never let go of that 'W' key, as your finger rolls the wheel and you swap through some of the best real-world labeled guns you could want, firing off 10,000 rounds in the drive to ""help"" the protaganist, the anti-hero, leave every last connection to his pain in a broken bloody heap behind him.Max Payne 1 may have changed the experience and what to expect from a shooter, but Max Payne 2 revolutionized it, finished the picture, and framed it on the wall in the Museum of Gaming forever after.

												Max Payne 2 has aged.  But it's aged well.  Despite being linear, Max Payne 2 is not scripted.  This really makes the game feel unique, even in the modern generation of gaming where everything boils down to QTE's and scripted set pieces that make the game feel more like a movie.But Max Payne 2 doesn't have this problem.  Every kill you make feels like it came from you, not the game forcing it upon you with a cinematic or a QTE.  The shooting is solid as hell, and the visuals have even held up decently despite the game's age.  Gameplay wise it's a standard third person shooter, but it incoroporates flawelessly a bullet-time system that hasn't been matched to this day.  If you don't already own a copy of Max Payne 2, you should do yourself a favor and get one.			"

												Damn this game is good! I played Max Payne 1 as wel and it's awesome that there are so much references to that in this game. ""Is this the Payne residence?""First of all I'd like to say the gameplay and shootouts are so smooth, bullettime makes this one of the best third person shooters ever. You dodge, jump and bullettime through the chapters while enjoying an awesome film-noir atmosphere.The story may be a bit average (especially when you haven't played the first one which I wouldn't recommend) but it has some awesome moments and makes you want to know what will happen. The surreal dream fragments are also fun to play inbetween the massive number of shootouts. When playing this game I actually got a bit sad that Rockstar wasn't able to pull this level of awesomeness of in Max Payne 3, so I'd suggest you play the first and second because the film noir vibe makes them the awesome games they are.

												Honestly saw the bundle of all 3 max paynes for 10$ and could not resist!! Blocky format on the first one and the second one was better but still not up to my current day expectations. Overall a beatiful shooter and the story roped me in and always kept me interested now i just have to wait for the 30GB Max Payne 3 to download!			"

												Max Payne 2 is my favorite MP game. The shooting in it is awesome and the story telling is alright. I've spent hours playing this game on all difficulties, and I've already completed it 6 times now. I, to this day, enjoy this game.			"

												This goes quite cheap when a sale comes through, and while it may not have the stylized ""experience"" for slow-down effects that many newer games have, it still maintains one of the most glorified renditions of it as a feature catalyst.  That being the ""arcadey"" presence and experience you can get from playing almost all of it. The story telling is phenomenal - was and still is some of the best character development, art style, plot mechanization, and acting that could be asked for in a game.  As true to form as it can be, it never shys from the brutality, edge, misfortune, or emotional futility - wherein you hope for the best and expect the inevitable worst - that one could ask for in a ""noir"" experience.Again, the real treat that sets MP2 off as one of the most important games of modern years is the intensity that can come from it once you allow yourself to get absorbed in this ""world"" - in the mind of the characters and the empathy of their emotions and actions.  The drive to experience the rest of their story to the end, to start a level and never let go of that 'W' key, as your finger rolls the wheel and you swap through some of the best real-world labeled guns you could want, firing off 10,000 rounds in the drive to ""help"" the protaganist, the anti-hero, leave every last connection to his pain in a broken bloody heap behind him.Max Payne 1 may have changed the experience and what to expect from a shooter, but Max Payne 2 revolutionized it, finished the picture, and framed it on the wall in the Museum of Gaming forever after.

PROS:+ bullet time+ epic noir story+ nice variety of weapons+ atmosphere of rainy New York+ couple levels playing as Mona+ nightmare levels+ soundtrackCONS:- some strangely designed fights (including the final boss fight)- relatively shorter game time than the first Max PayneComment:The epic noir-themed bullet-time shooter that started the Max Payne series for me. The gameplay is good, no, it's REALLY good. But that is not why I fell in love with this game....it was the story, the beautiful dark bitter story about a man that loses everything. It grabbed me from the beginning and didn't let go until it was done. I played this years ago (before Max Payne) so don't let the gametime above fool you, I was hooked on this game. After completing it I had to go get it's predecessor. I pirated both games. Now after over a decade I bought them because even now I still fondly remember how I used to play this series. If you haven't yet, go play them, it's a fantastic gaming experience...			"

												Max Payne 2 is amazing. It is a huge improvement over the first Max Payne in nearly every way. One of my favorite, and most important, changes is that Max Payne himself no longer looks like he's smelling a rank fart. He looks like a human. The other characters also look like humans, rather than video game models wearing human faces. The bullet time is infinitely more useful as it replenishes faster and it gets a boost when you kill someone. The dodge-shooting also works better as it will let you keep firing from the ground, and doesn't immediately jump up and break the action until you stop firing.The story is a lot more cohesive, and more interesting. It's not just a dude killing everyone in his way to get to the person who killed his wife and daughter. There are different motives and they change, and the characters change. The game is short as hell, but so was the first Max Payne, and with less frustration.Max Payne 2 is a better game than the original and, for all intents and purposes, you shouldn't feel compelled to play through the first Max Payne before you play this one. It is a truly great game.			"

												I couldn't remember the last time I decided to review a game. Maybe a little while ago, maybe a long time ago. As a result, I got a little rusty, so I decided to make the entire review for this game a generic monlouge to kill time. I opened up Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne, a critically acclaimed masterpiece as they call it. When I booted up the game, the menu showed an option to explain the plot of the original game to newcomers. Although I owned the original game I thought it was a nice touch and it will let said newcomers in easier. Like last game I expected it to be dark, and I was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ right. Max is a man that goes through many hardships, like in this game he falls in love, becomes addicted to painkillers, among others including the trauma he endured in the original game. I won't spoil the plot for you, but let me tell you- it's not pretty. However, although the story's good, this may not mean the gameplay's neccesarily good. I mindlessly took some painkillers and gave it a go. What I found was a deep combat system, filled with multiple weapons all used in different circumstances, a neat little bullet time feature that changed the core gameplay, and challenging level design. It seems to me that's a pretty good game. I look off into the dark, murky night lit by the lights of New York, away from the soft glow of my laptop screen. I decided that this game was extremley high quality, and would reccomend it to anyone. I go back onto my laptop and type like an ant. I feel good.			"

												Easily the best Max Payne in the series, almost every aspect of this game is nothing short of amazing. It improves upon the original a hell of a lot, making it feel almost like a completely different game, and it is. It's one of those games where the developers really put a lot of time and effort into all the different details, and it shows. The writing is actually really really good, with a ton of memorable quotes both dramatic and hilarious. The graphics, while dated, still don't look bad at all and show a good sense of style, especially the comic book cutscenes. Plus the ragdoll physics are just as hilarious and fun now as they were when it first came out. The voice acting, sound effects, and soundtrack are all well done, with this game showing one of the first songs to be released by Poets of the Fall. The story is dark and dramatic, yet the sense of humor through the game keeps it from being too overwhelming and even more interesting. Plus it is told in a way that both well paced and keeps the gameplay fun. A good story that is told well is pretty rare in games, especially one with as much action as this.If there are any issues with the game, 1 would be that there is in fact an escort mission. As far as escort missions go, the setup is actually pretty hilarious, but has the same annoyances most escort missions do, though at least the target is smart enough to take cover. There is also another section that blends escort mission and sniping mission, though thankfully that is far less annoying and actually does change up the gameplay in this instance. The other issue is the game is a bit repetitive. The mission variety is great, but the actual shooting gameplay throughout the entire game remains the same. You get to shoot, use slow motion or a slow motion dive... and take painkillers. There are some dream sequences but none of them really add any variety to the actual gameplay, they serve more like interactive cutscenes. Thankfully the game isn't long enough to where it ever gets boring. If you enjoy slow motion action, third person shooters, or dark stories that are told well, I highly recommend getting this game. It's suprisingly really funny yet really dramatic and engaging, and the gameplay is some of the best third person shooter action out there. One of my personal favorites, a fantastic game especially for the price these days.			"

												Max Payne 2 is also a classic must have game to keep/have/play with! The game has the same setting (New York City) but it's alot better graphic wise. Also the characters facial model looks alot better than the facial models of the characters on Max Payne. The story of this game is still true to its origins but in a love situation (Max+Mona 4ever <3). Anyways I definitely recommend this game to any gamer who is into constant action shooting and awesome slow motion gunfights! :DPlot: 10/10Characters: 10/10Action: 20/10Facial Models: 100/10 :D (Because I don't have to die in laughter looking at a constipated face!

												Max Payne 2 is more of the same, and that's not really a bad thing.  If you're not familiar with the game series, it's a third person shooter with bullet time effects and a noir style story.  There are slight improvements over the first game, such as being able to equip grenades / molotovs as a ""secondary weapon"" instead of having to switch from a gun to use them.  The graphics are much easier on the eyes too.  Probably the most novel part of MP2 is the levels where you have to work alongside or play as Max's love interest / femme fatale, Mona Sax.  It's interesting to play through the same timespan from both characters' point of view.  The story is fairly predictable, and the gunplay is fun as always.  The writers have played it safe with a formula that works (with a few tweaks), and as a result have made another solid game in the series.  Recommended.			"

												Solid third person shooter that tells a great story and features one of the most memorable romance-plots in video game history. I played through this game straight from 7 PM to 4 AM without stopping to do anything. It's very immersive and utterly compelling. If I had played this back in 2003 my mind would have been blown. Literally. Like, it seriously might've been a medical emergency. The graphics are outstanding for a 2003 title and the cinematic action is very well executed, it featured a romance-themed plot that wasn't (and really still isn't) seen often in video games. Remedy is just a fine developer in general, they put a lot of detail into their games both plot and design wise. If you like this game I recommend playing Alan Wake (same developer), it's very similiar in many ways though horror-themed instead of action-romance. TL;DR: Probably the only game I've ever been compelled to finish in one sitting. Immersive, engaging and satisfying. Though I did have to set compatability to Win98 (i'm using Win7).			"

												The Fall of Max Payne is one of those games that has pitch perfect writing. Sam Lake is a god amongst video game writers. What it comes down to is Max's inner monologues that subdue the player into escaping reality and entering the stark world of Max Payne.Taking place two years after the events of the first masterpiece, Max Payne has been reinstated into the NYPD and is on the case of a group of hitmen that dress up as a cleaning crew. Max follows their trail while uncovering a conspiracy involving the Inner Circle, corrupt politicians, and dirty cops. Mona Sax reemerges early in the game, surviving her apparent death after getting shot in the head in the first one. She's on the run from the police but works with Max as they have similar goals. The fall of Max Payne is that he falls in love with Mona Sax, he can't bring himself to turn her in or fight her; which makes the game a film noir love story (as stated on the iconic cover art).The gameplay is very similar to the first one, why fix something that isn't broken, right? But the graphics are substantially better, Max's face doesn't look like a distorted Sam Lake and the models are certainly more polyganyl. The nightmare scenes are easier but still kinda crazy. And the music, the music is SO good. I would at times just pause the game and let the music play in the menu while getting some water or pop.Outstanding9.7/10			"

												Solid third person shooter that tells a great story and features one of the most memorable romance-plots in video game history. I played through this game straight from 7 PM to 4 AM without stopping to do anything. It's very immersive and utterly compelling. If I had played this back in 2003 my mind would have been blown. Literally. Like, it seriously might've been a medical emergency. The graphics are outstanding for a 2003 title and the cinematic action is very well executed, it featured a romance-themed plot that wasn't (and really still isn't) seen often in video games. Remedy is just a fine developer in general, they put a lot of detail into their games both plot and design wise. If you like this game I recommend playing Alan Wake (same developer), it's very similiar in many ways though horror-themed instead of action-romance. TL;DR: Probably the only game I've ever been compelled to finish in one sitting. Immersive, engaging and satisfying. Though I did have to set compatability to Win98 (i'm using Win7).			"

												Max Payne 2 is more of the same, and that's not really a bad thing.  If you're not familiar with the game series, it's a third person shooter with bullet time effects and a noir style story.  There are slight improvements over the first game, such as being able to equip grenades / molotovs as a ""secondary weapon"" instead of having to switch from a gun to use them.  The graphics are much easier on the eyes too.  Probably the most novel part of MP2 is the levels where you have to work alongside or play as Max's love interest / femme fatale, Mona Sax.  It's interesting to play through the same timespan from both characters' point of view.  The story is fairly predictable, and the gunplay is fun as always.  The writers have played it safe with a formula that works (with a few tweaks), and as a result have made another solid game in the series.  Recommended.			"

												Max Payne 2 Is a great moba game where you can desing your own army with the mana you recieve from the towers,Even when you are a new player .. you always have a chance to win a battle.The maps are good. And sometimes you can get an alternative characters like Mona which is a DLCAnother thing about DLC for this game. My favorite one is the skins, Anyone who likes MOBA games should have this on their library+Skills+Shop+Tower Zone+DLC+Skateboards+Cupcakes+South Park+Cats +Attack On Titan+SpidermanWith a little math all these combined is..9/11Yes, I feel like this is not the best , But still goodI know 9 out of 11 is a ridiculous review ,However if this had more items to getAnd maybe guns that shoot bible I would give it the 2 more points it needs, Thanks For Reading This Official Review ByxXx_men_lover_xXx			"

												The Fall of Max Payne is one of those games that has pitch perfect writing. Sam Lake is a god amongst video game writers. What it comes down to is Max's inner monologues that subdue the player into escaping reality and entering the stark world of Max Payne.Taking place two years after the events of the first masterpiece, Max Payne has been reinstated into the NYPD and is on the case of a group of hitmen that dress up as a cleaning crew. Max follows their trail while uncovering a conspiracy involving the Inner Circle, corrupt politicians, and dirty cops. Mona Sax reemerges early in the game, surviving her apparent death after getting shot in the head in the first one. She's on the run from the police but works with Max as they have similar goals. The fall of Max Payne is that he falls in love with Mona Sax, he can't bring himself to turn her in or fight her; which makes the game a film noir love story (as stated on the iconic cover art).The gameplay is very similar to the first one, why fix something that isn't broken, right? But the graphics are substantially better, Max's face doesn't look like a distorted Sam Lake and the models are certainly more polyganyl. The nightmare scenes are easier but still kinda crazy. And the music, the music is SO good. I would at times just pause the game and let the music play in the menu while getting some water or pop.Outstanding9.7/10			"

												Once I had finished the original Max Payne on PS2 and found out my friend had the sequel, 'Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne.' I remember playing it and feeling for the characters once again. I thought that the bullet time had been greatly improved with its speed reloads and updated physics and animation and felt that the game also had a great story.I picked this up in the Max Payne bundle during the 2015-16 Christmas holidays for a small price.Has performance issues on Windows 7 and up which can be easily fixed through modding or playing around the in files of the game folder.Would highly recommend only if you have finished the original.I'd pick up Max Payne 3 as well (isn't included in the bundle) and give it a try. Although the gameplay and storylines are very different, the keeps the same overall style of game but with improved features but also removes some features making it more of a challenge. (Example being limited to 3 guns)			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is the second game in the Max Payne trilogy developed by Remedy Entertainment, the same people behind the Alan Wake game and published by none other than Rockstar Games, makers of such games as Bully, Manhunt, L.A. Noire and the Grand Theft Auto seriesThe story continues right after Max Payne, I won't spoil anything from either the previous game or this sequel's story, however the story is action packed to the brim, just the same as Max PayneThankfully Max Payne 2 ran much better than Max Payne, however, you will need a widescreen modification for widescreen monitors, but on the whole, Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne ran much better than Max Payne, obviously Max Payne was developed much more before Max Payne 2 so it is understandableThe graphics, for what they were at the time have aged pretty well. The environments are well designed and the attention to detail is really there, and the character models too have been greatly improvedThe music and sound effects are good and the voice acting is good too. However, the game does suffer with volume level issues, sometimes the voice actors sound loud then at some points they sound low. Sometimes the cutscenes volume is good and at some points I can't hear a thing and have to riase the volume from my speakers to hear what they are saying, this is due to it being an old game so I don't blame the game per sei. Thankfully, it wasn't as bad as Max PayneThe cutscenes are told through a mixture of a form of a graphic novel and in-game custcenes and although Max Payne did suffer with the graphic novel custcenes (see Max Payne review for more details), they have been greatly improved in the sequelThe gameplay is a mixed bag. The famous bullet time is fun and will save you a lot of health as Max Payne dies easily, even on medium and easy difficulty. And the game is hard, you will die constantly, so much so, that I had to replay the game from medium difficulty to easy difficulty and still the game was hardYou will die constantly, and this is where my main complaint comes in. There is no auto save! If you get shot and die, you will reset to the latest save you or the game has done which is normally in the beginning of a chapter, so if you did not save manually (either by pressing F5 or by saving in the main menu), then expect to be teleported back to the latest save either you or the game did for you. This can be extremely annoying!However, Max Payne 2 is a fantastic sequel to the trilogy and I can't wait to play Rockstar's take in; Max Payne 3Max Payne 2 runs very well on modern systems, just be sure to download a mod that makes the game playable on widescreen monitors and you should be fine! Just be wary of the game's difficulty at some points... RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Max Payne 2 offers you to good storyline , graphics ,physics (this game released in 2003 and it is still looks fine ) and amazing noir york atmosphere. Max Payne's nightmares and bullet time make this game more unique. Max Payne's feelings real and dramatic so that you are understand the purpose and actions of the max . Comic book style is so impactful in the storyline ( imo it makes the game more dramatic and more noir). Game is little bit short but details in the story make this part more tolerable and you might want to end this game again because hardest difficulty offers you the different ending.			"

												Max Payne was genius for its time. Max Payne 2 is, in my opinion, genius for ALL TIME. The gameplay feels smoother and more action packed than the original, the story is also much more emotional and unlike the first i actually felt for the characters. While the first was certainly a good game it left me feeling unfufilled. Max Payne 2 leaves me with absolute satisfaction, in fact its ending was so good id rather they hadn't made max payne 3, which wasn't terrible but didnt have the same amount of detail and DID have much less superior writing.

												To start off, if you have not played the original Max Payne than a good majority of the plot will not make any sense to you so I recommend that you play the first one before this one. This game is significantly shorter than the original, but that does not mean it is not as good. I consider this to be a worthy successor to the original in every way. The plot adds to what was left off in the original and then some. The game is just as violent and action packed as the first. Before you buy this though I suggest you prepare yourself to have to make some minor adjustments in the games files becuase this game is old and does not run well on newer systems, but it does work.

												The second titles in any series are usualy said to be worse than their predecessors. Max Payne 2 is a clear proof that it is not quite true.Noir atmosphere, brutal and hectic action, and even a love plot which you may have never expected in game like this, but it suits it just perfectly. Another legendary game brought to you by Remedy.For emotional sensitive people it's recommended to unlock Death On Arrival difficulty as soon as possible, the end of story would be less painful than.

												A heavily improved follow-up to the already entertaining Max Payne, and when played on Steam it doesn't require as much file-diving as the original. It loses a bit of its charm with most of the developers gone as actors, but the story is still highly enjoyable and the so is the gameplay.			"

												I played this back when it was first released but couldn't remember much about it so I decided to replay it.  It still holds up surprisingly well for being an older game.  The gunplay feels good (with better hit detection than the original Max Payne), the graphics are improved, and it seems to take itself a little more seriously by dropping all the goofy cartoon faces that Max Payne would make in the original (there's even an audio clip in the game where they kind of make fun of themselves for doing that).  The same old comic-style noir cut scenes are still here and as good as ever.  The story seemed a little less interesting this time and was more about Max chasing Mona Sax around and shooting up all kinds of baddies in the process.  There's a tag team section where Mona covers Max with a sniper rifle while he traverses a construction yard that is probably the pinnacle of the game's ingenuity.  The ""All Ghillied Up"" mission in Call of Duty 4 gets a lot of praise for this idea but Max Payne 2 really thought of it first even if they didn't execute it quite as stylistically.  Lots of interesting locales though and the way you defeat the final boss was a means of thinking outside the box before it was cool to make games that think outside the box.			"

												Max Payne 2 is so far the best Max Payne in the series: It is technolocially more advanced than the first one and it doesn't take itself as seriously as the third one. For such a low low price, I can recommend it to anyone who enjoys 3rd person shooters with strong story. The story of Max Payne 2 is nothing special: a detective who plays by his own rules and has nothing to lose has to undercover another conspiracy against him and the people of NYC.Very serious stuff but what makes this story-line bearable compared to the 3rd ones whinetastic borefest is that everything around our main characters (enemies, tv-shows and other npcs) are not taking themselfs seriously.for example: The tv-shows we see throughout the game are recapping the story in a extremely corny way and the enemies are bumbling doofuses. The gameplay is somewhat showing its age: combat usually happens withing 10 meter radius.This is partly because weapons have randomized spread but mostly because the maps are VERY small on todays standards (altough back in the PS2 era they were AMAZING).The main positive of the randomized spread is that cutscenes are something pure comical gold (for example the scene where the police-chief Bravura gets shot multible times he sometimes won't get hit once but he still gets bullet-holes in his chest)An addiditon to the absurdity of gun-fights is the early ragdoll-physics that cause bodies to fly all over the place (this is especially funny dring the ""dramatic slowmo"" scenes that pop up in specific parts of the game)My advice?Go to slowmo (or ""bullet-time"" as the game calls it) when enemies appear (preferably after they have spouted their funny dialoge), get within touching distance and start sircle strafing: nothing can survive that.This migth be a cheap tactic but so is the game: enemies are way accurate than you and there is more of 'em.Then again: you can heal yourself and use basic tactics against an enemy that mostly just runs at you.Only negative that I can really point out is that when you do the John Woo style jump, Max will stand up immediately after releasing the shoot-button (no matter how amny enemies are aiming him down) and you can't fire during the stand-up animation but this can be countered by using basic tactics.The guns that the game offers you are mostly pea-shooters but the game ie VERY generous with its ammo so it evens out in the end (exept the shotguns which all suck nards).In conclusion: This game does show it's age but it is still a solid game experience with goor replayability.It was good in 2003 and it still holds up in 2016.

I will use my oolder box that still has Windows 7 on it and see if it will run there. Very disappointed.			"

												A thrilling conclusion to the events set up in Max Payne, Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is a rollercoaster ride of intrigue and murder. Sam Lake is a god of videogame writing, and it shows here as plot twists and betrayals abound and leave you wondering if it ever really was black and white.The gunplay is stellar, but special note must be given to the bullet-time and shootdodge mechanics of MP2. In MP1, you could only slow down time when you dodged, which was a good but flawed mechanic. In MP2, you can use bullettime without dodging (though shootdodge remains a viable option) and every kill you make while in the slowed timescale refills your bullettime meter a small function. If you're quick and skillful, you can keep it up for a long time.Overall, I'd recommend this game if you're a fan of noir, good storytelling, great gunplay and/or the first game.10/10 Bullets			"

												Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne- 1 из лучших игр от Rokstar, как мне кажется.    В те времена выпускать такой шедевр многого стоило.    Ясное дело, что люди нового поколоения не увидят всю прелесть этой игры, но мы-люди старого поколония, любящие по сей день игры 2000-2005 годов, гордимся этим, что в то время, было очень круто.    В данной части у нас есть возможность познакомиться с самими главным героем, нажав на определенный зоголовок в главном меню.    Также мы можем поиграть в разные режимы, например, ""выживание на время"", где будут появляться каждым разом враги, а ваша задача их убивать.    У вас есть возможность сыграть сюжетные задания на время. Когда-то давно было классно соревноватся на время с друзьями.    Но самое главное, конечно же сам сюжет, сюжет восхитителен, прекрасен, словами даже нельзя описать, насколько он мне понравился. Всего вас ожидает 3 главы, где будет пролог и по 6-7 подглав, где в каждой будет чудесные, небольшие видеоролики с хорошей озвучкой и актерской игрой, а также небольшие комиксы, где играет восхитительная музыка на заднем плане, а также присутствует озвучка. Комикс очень красиво нарисовали и детализировали его.    В данной игре нету уровней сложности, что, мне кажется, очень хорошо.    Огромное количество разного оружия.    Интересные и запоминающие личности, которые будут встречаться в ходе игры.    Красиво проработаная графика, приятно на нее смотреть.    Неплохая и грустная концовка игры с прекрасным сопровождением.    Конечно есть моменты, которые не понятны, например, куда надо стрелять, чтобы уничтожить главного ""Босса"".    Также, во время сюжетки, был момент, что нашему главному персонажу, попали в голову, но он остался жив, не понятно.Всем советую покупать!!    Игра заслуживает 10 из 10.			"

												It's a nice sequel. In comparison with it's predecessor, it has more storyline and immersion. Tragedy and conflict strike your feelings quite strong when you least expect.New weapons, new outfit and sometimes even new perspectives.The enemies are softer than in the first one, but it does compensate with more non-fighting scenes (dream/nightmare states), which unplug you a bit from the combat trance.The voice acting combined with the clever picked (noir-like) lines give a great ambiance to the whole plot and are really fitting to the character.

The game itself is a major improvement to Max payne 1 by adding physics and better graphics although i found this one to be a little too short and i don't know if its just me but it takes a ridiculous amount of time for the launcher to start (1-2 minutes). But do i recommend this game? The answer is yes because despite its flaws it still is a great game even until today.			"

												Max Payne 2 is the ideal sequel. It kept everything good from the first game and then made it better, showing sometimes that remaking the wheel isn't necessary. A must buy for action game fans.			"

												Brilliant, the best out of the three Max Paynes. Its can basically run on any computer, has a great story, unlike MP1 it has ragdolls and unlike MP3 its still in NYC and doesn't need a good computer to play it with. Overall a fantastic game. 10/10			"

												Much much better than the first. The movement is a lot smoother and the shots actually affect enemies where you shoot them. For example, if you hit a goon in the head, he WILL die, unlike in the first Max Payne game. There's also a lot more guns and you no longer have to switch weapons to throw a grenade/molotov. Hell, you can even melee. The game also has you play as Mona Sax, letting you see what her role was while Max does his thing.			"

												And I thought the first Max Payne was depressing as hell. This is probably the best of the trilogy. The noir theme got darker and more realistic, and we see Max, instead of walking out on a high note for avenging his loved ones, we see him lose another he began to love and spiral into the depths of a depression that seemed impossible to escape. A gritty end to an amazingly well-done game, even if it did make me feel rather upset and hollow.			"

												Though at point the game is very frustrating, I love it to bits, the epic moments it can create by player controlled slow-motion and dive shots create beautiful gameplay and creates a suspense for the player, wish the health was slightly buffed, the pain killer drop rates were higher and that body armor was a possibility.

												It is hard to recomend this game at the full price of 10 dollars because of it's short lenghth and poor story compared to the first game's story. If you are wondering what this game has to offer compared to the first one the only real changes are that the guns are more balanced and you feel like you need to conserve ammo for certain guns more. If you want to know what I think about Max Payne as a game just check out my review of the first one.Get this one on sale. It is about half as long as Max Payne with only slightly better gameplay, graphics, and artwork.			"

												Excellent Game. Just finished it a few mins ago and I don't think I have been this satisfied with a game in a long time. I understand that some people want less cutscenes and more action but I felt that the story was solid and was brought out through the cutscenes. The game does feel a little short because it took me approx 5 hours to finish which isn't bad. I don't think enough people took the time to explore the levels and find all the little touches that make this game one of the best. Graphics are very impressive for its time and the sound is outstanding,			"

												The interactive gun sound design is excellent.  But here is the fork in the road - If you want to play a shooter for the sake of shooting, you'll like it; if you want to play a Max Payne game, I doubt you will like it.  Story-wise, it feels like a bad dream and in that respect, it works very well - it truly feels like a bad dream where all of it makes sense in how it all plays out, but it makes NO sense upon waking up in retrospect.  Double-edged sword for me, don't know how else to explain it without saying ""I liked it but I didn't like it.""  As a functioning game, good job.  As a Max Payne game, I was underwhelmed unfortunately.Original Max Payne holds true, play that one for an EXCELLENT story with the same satisfying gameplay caliber.			"

												Medicore game overall. Disaster comparing to the first Max Payne. Graphics are ok and visuals overall are good. Music is alright and the sounds too. I like how they added a new addition to bullet time where if the player is continuously shooting while falling, he/she will remain on the ground untill he/she is finished shooting. Gameplay overall is good.Story is crap, lacks any depth, recycled material and typical old friend is now enemy BS. Little to NO CHALLENGE what so ever, you are spammed with ammo and health here and there. Hardest difficulty is a joke. If you have ALOT of free time and a big fan of Max Payne 1, you can give this a go so you'll know how bad of a game this is and you didn't miss anything. Did i mention thtat he main character gets a complete face switch and voice acting? F LAME BS, its not Max Payne anymore.			"

When I press play to try and run the game, nothing will show up. When I press play again, it will say that the same application is already running even though there is no tab for the game that appears to be ""open"" and when I go into the task manager, the application shows as a background process. Have I been scammed? I think so. I also wrote a reveiw on Max Payne 3, stating that the game did end up running but anther problem occured preventing me from playing the game at all.I do NOT reccomend this game due to the chance of crashing or not even running.-This is a copy of my review of Max Payne, due to the same exact problem, I had no means in re-writing the report again-			"

												Only a clarification before all - MaxPayne, the original one from 2001 was a far superior product. Max Payne 2 recycled everything strong about it . Lacking though the doomsday gloom of the 90's occult gothic. Though often unnamed - that's what added the spice to the tragedy. Instead it attempts to portray that tragedy replayed as Max tries to overcome it.  The story of this game seems rather a rehash of the previous levels with new skins, physics, weapons and so on.What is left of Noir, is buried under the monotonous (in the bad sense of the word) interiors. Build sites, endless apartment halls, streets and only by the end some sort of a palace with many awkward and glitchy moments. The strongest sequences are the beggining one, another one with the Police HQ... and that's all I remember memorable. I never understood why Max Payne 2 was good because the romance was weak, the antagonist was a joke and... overall it's just like making Die Hard 2 after Die Hard 1.But how silly, insulting the cliffhanger comes around. What were they thinking? The game might be worth it for one playthrough to see if you enjoy the new ""autumn"" setting contrary to the winter ""Ragnarok"" of the first game.It attempts to show a relationship [Spoilers!!!]  revived  of the first game (and does so poorly in my opinion). In fact, even the ending seems like a repetition of the first game's marvelous conclusion of an epic, whereas here - it seems as if I already played this somewhere... Stereotypes and old characters are back. Yet I would prefer them to remain in the dust as they unfolded, much, much more mysteriously and enigmatically in the previous game yet again. Only for action fans.Cannot find a reason for someone to play this except if you're preparing to take head on the whole trilogy.This is the worst of the 3.			"

My PC may actually need to be restarted to run on a single core everytime I want to play the game? I didn't try it, because I don't care if it works. It should be listed as not compatable with a multi-core system. Be aware before making the purchase. If I knew it would be this much of a hassle I wouldn't have bought it, even on sale.			"

												I change my opinion about this. This is a bad game ! The fantastic mood of the first game is totally lost in the sequel ! Gameplay boring from the first minute. I feel emptyness and pointless gunfight from the start even that is the weakest part of of the serie ( and much worse in the two ). Polished graphics don't save the title, while the bad rag-doll, bone, character animation still exist. If you love the first one and not a blind fanatic of the serie, just walk away, it destroys everything the first built ......original post:I never have a tiket to the hype-train of max payne. I think these games are one of the most over-rated / hyped title in the computer game history right after the halo serie. Don't misundertund me, max payne  is a good game with professional story-telling, atmosphere / mood what makes it unique feeling to play with it. On the other side, the first one is ugly like hell ! :) Caracter models very unpolished, animation is bad, gunfight very basic except the fantastic bullet time ! The second looks better but the game mechanics is the same or worse if it's possible at all . Btw, these are good games in overall but nothing more or less !			"

												I usually don't write reviews, much less a ""not recommended"" one, but this one has been eating at me a long time.  I know people generally read the first couple of lines and move on, but I wanted to do this, if only for me because I'm just another opinionated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the internet.Before I begin, let me clarify:Max Payne 1 was the bestMax Payne 3 was alright, but not as good as MP1also: SPOILER WARNINGSOkay, where to begin?  When I first played MP2, it was a Max Payne marathon session, so I had just finished the first game (again) and wanted to finish the second one (which I had not yet played) before I played Max Payne 3.Now, when people talk about the series, MP3 especially, they always mention how the story was mediocre especially when compared to the first two games.  Granted, it wasn't much, the lack of noire was sorely missed and when compared to the FIRST game, yes, it is particularly weak.  However, I am completely baffled when people say how good MP2's story was and how it was better than MP3.  No.  Just ... no.The flimsy story for this game (spoiler warning) is simply thus:Take every character who didn't die in the first game and kill them off.There you go.  That's it.  That's the whole 3-4 hour game right there, and the story abruptly ends when the bad guy, former ""friend"" Vlad who decides to kill you because they couldn't think of anybody else to do it and because he's Russian so why not, is killed.  The entire story, in a nutshell, is: ""... and everybody died, the end.""  If anything, this game is what paved the way for MP3 to have no connection to the first game's grim, atmosphereic noir setting simply by destroying any way to connect a third game to the first or second game.  And to anyone who wants to talk about how ""gritty and noir"" the story is, let me remind you that Vinnie Cogniti (or however it's spelled) puts on a ♥♥♥♥ing mascot outfit his arch rival gave him only to find out it's a bomb.  You're then tasked with saving his defenseless♥♥♥♥♥for a level so that in the next cutscene (an actual cutscene, not a graphic novel panel like in the first) he can get blown up anyway.  Whoop-dee-♥♥♥♥ing-doo.So what do you do in this game?  Well, you run around and shoot people with a screwy version of bullet-time (when you activate it, time doesn't really slow down and only does the more people you kill, so if you've got a sliver of health and want to have those extra split seconds to take out a big group, like in the first game, you're in for a surprise.) occasionally triggering a graphic novel scene like in the first game, but those only come like once a CHAPTER.  And while in first game you could watch all those bits and it would tell a semi-cohesive story, in this they only come around long enough to say ""HEY LOOK, SEE?  THIS IS JUST LIKE THE FIRST GAME!  LOOK AT THI-Oop, nevermind, it's over, back to game.""  That's really all the noir is in this game: a coating, something to fool you into thinking it's a noir story like in the first.  Oh, and there's the really ""FUN"" bit where you have to protect someone whil using a sniper rifle, because trying to keep an NPC alive from a mile away is always great.In the four or so hours it will take to beat the game, you'll get to do such things as watch cutscenes, kill guys with goofy ragdoll physics (which is actually pretty fun, don't get me wrong), go to the Ragnarok again (how original), visit the same Fun-House level three ♥♥♥♥ing times (with slightly changed layout) based on Valkyr V (see guys? this is just like the first game!) and along the way, Max will meet a variety of characters from the first game before they are subsequently killed as well as a paltry handful of new characters who get killed off to.  Oh, and if you played the first game, Mona (who got kinda killed but possibly wasn't killed or whatever) apparently survived and will be your love interest through the game until she dies at the end.  And as I said, the big bad guy is Vlad, who it turns out, in a huge case of the devs going ""What things can we take from the first game and cram into here and retcon the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of, used to be in the same group as Alfred Woden, who he kills, then he kills Mona (she undied so she could re-die), then you kill him, then Max has a tiny necrophilia scene and then it just ends.  Max Payne accomplishes nothing, rescues no one, learns nothing except that people near him usually end up dead pretty fast (which I kinda thought was also part of MP1's story).  Oh, and if you thought the characters in MP3 were pretty unlikeable and had no connection to Max, then I re-invite you to play this game again and really take a good, long hard thought about it.If you hated Max Payne 3's departure from noire and the things that made the first game so incredible, you can give a big round of applause to this game right here.  After playing it, there really isn't any ground left move forward from.  The only thing a sequel could have done is go far, far away from where the first two games took place and do something ""fresh"" with the franchise and, basically, just find some completely new ground to tread on.So, in short, it's a functional game that goes nowhere, has no point, brings nothing new to the table and only does the ""Noir"" bit because it has to (and believe me, they only begrudgingly come out every now and again because it's in their contract claus) and, having never played it before, I beat it in a couple of hours in one sitting.  This game offers nothing and delivers nothing.  You're better off just playing the first game because that one actually is a good story, or if you really have to have ragdolls flopping around, get the third because of dem physics.			"

												I played the original Max Payne years ago on the original CD version (I've never touched my Steam copy).  It was a straightforward third person shooter whose graphics weren't all that great even in its own time.  Its real strengths were its story (an offering of over-the-top noir detective grit with themes from Norse mythology) and its use of ""bullet time"", which took advantage of the popularity of the contemporary Matrix films.The gameplay is not much different in this sequel.  It is still a linear third-person shooter with similar graphics and the occasional surreal nightmare level.  The cutscenes look the same and it remains in the noir genre.  However, the story is not nearly as interesting and abandons the interesting thematic choices of the original.  Since that was the main strength of the original, I don't think this one is worth your time at this point.  Just move on to part 3.			"

Payne does become a more fleshed out character though, which elevates the material a bit more. Repetitive setpieces with the addition of excessive handholding drag this down even more. Average, even when it's at its best.			"

												Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is the sequel (obviously) to Max Payne going back to its original way to tell its story, gameplay and slightly improved graphics. Same as before you get to kill hundreds of enemies using the weapons at your disposal with some small sequences where you play as Mona, Max's GF/waifu in this story. The story has some supermegaultrawumboamazing unexpected plot twists that we all could expect. Pros- Improved gameplay, story (still lackluster).Cons- Story (as I wrote: supermegaultrawumboamazing), waves upon waves upon waves of faceless baddies to eliminate with bullet time.IMHO: 4/10 SHYAMALAN STYLE PLOTWIST!!! meh...

												I haven't played a single second of this game, but if it's anything like the first I'm assuming it's a giant, heaping, steaming pile of rotten rat feces, baking in the hot sun, drenched in dog♥♥♥♥♥♥  The Max Payne series is the most overrated trash to ever grace the gaming landscape.Why the ♥♥♥♥ did they even make a sequel?  To continue the ""compelling"" story of killing generic mafia goons?  So dark, so deep, so tense, the story of Max Payne is.  I don't even have to play this to tell you to avoid it at all costs.  The first problem with this game lies within the name itself, ""The Fall of Max Payne.""  Pardon me, but, isn't that the first game?  Must be fun to beat a dead horse.The thing is, you are reading Max Payne 2 reviews because you enjoyed the first game and you want more.  This is where you ♥♥♥♥ed up.  Shame on you, you tasteless ♥♥♥♥.  The same people who enjoy Max Payne are people who put ketchup on their hot dogs.			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 3 thousand26four, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very large sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												Yessss... Max Payne 2!!! Don't let my hours played fool you, It's about the 8th time I started playing it which should tell you enough. I'm very passionate about this game cause it's a true piece of art. Yes I said it, like its precursor it's very noticable that the developing team has had tons of fun and heart while making these games (unlike part 3 which rockstar F***'ed in my opinion). The fact alone that they tried to figure out the right style for the game, to make it all come together. The comics that tell you parts of the story in between, the great voice actors (GREAT!!.. VOICE!!.. ACTORS!!), the music, the long story which even ingame has carefully selected cinematic cutscenes..For the love of God if you never played this just buy the freakin' game already, even if it's not on sale!Besides all this Max Payne 2 was an innovating game bringing slow-motion bullettime to your pc, and it's a gem that can hold its name proudly between other timeless games. Now if you'd excuse me, I got a Max Payne mural to make in my bedroom (no it's not Max in sexy underwear). Oh, and make sure you watch the tv series in the game. There are many worlds inside this world. 9/10			"

												Shorter than the first game in the series, but far better in gameplay. This could be used as example of ultimate action game 10 years ago and maybe even now. Max Payne is one the best heroes in video game history, noir story excells in its narrative and presentation too. Plus you can play as Mona Sax as well!			"

												This game is a sequel to the previous. The story is connected, but you can play this without playing the first and not being lost in the middle of its story. I only found a ""let down"" with it: being shorter than the first Max Payne.But despite being shorter, this game has a good ""replay value"": you unlock 3 new difficulties when you finish the game for the first time, and it has mod support too.The biggest challenge to most of buyers is to make this game run in modern systems like Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 for example. Well, the solution which work for me was the one described in THIS DISCUSSION (just click here).And if you encounter some problems with the wide screen like stretching the image, you can use this fix from THIS SITE (just click here)[thirteenag.github.io].And don't use Anti Aliasing. Disable it in the config window launched by the game. If you want it, force it in your graphic card panel, or it may make the game crash at the cut scenes.My rating: 9/10.			"

												Wow. In just 2 years Remedy was able to make a sequel that made the combat even more engaging, have the dream sequences feel even more ominous, have more depth into it's main character and have some great development in-general. The atmosphere of the world is so thick you can shoot bullets through it. This game also acts as a staple of ""past generation game design"" with some solutions to problems being left for you to figure it out and some non-linear paths to events of the gameplay just from the player mucking about or listening to NPCs. One moment has Payne going through an apartment complex with a couple civillians that can tag along with you, helping you out in gunfights and even giving you cover when you reach a certain point. Or you can simply shoot them right away, there's no penalty for it. As long as you have a gun in your had at the time you can shoot anyone and everyone you like. There's simple touches to the gameplay that don't do much other than making Payne look even cooler (slo-mo reloading). Another one of these is TV, yes you can just sit back (stand) and watch some telly. Being honest, I spent 10 minutes watching different things on the TV until it started repeating, damn. One of the things on the TV leads into the great and not very obvious or in your face symbolism. 2 of the recurring shows on the TV give some nice symbolism to the events of the story at the moment that you watch it, or into Payne's own mindset. Sometimes even teasing future events yet to happen. And by the last level you can watch both series finale's. It's this great dream-like state that the game has that I particularly loved and that the games use to great effect. There's some nice cameo's that, if you're paying attention, you'll notice right away as well. A few points give you control of a second character for story purposes, and it's a little weird when you discover that she has the same bullet-time abilities as Payne. Just like the last one, Max's VA is just brilliant at his lines. While everyone else is either ""eergh"", okay or inconsistant with  their performance. Unlike the last one the game works like a charm, with absolutely no bugs or technical problems. By the end the game's world feels just as lonely and cold as Payne is feeling from what's happened during the game, the way the story unravels is great and some moment are pretty heavy *-*. Unfortuately it doesn't have the visual scope of the original and a lot of the locations you are in are just the same places you were in the last game. There are a couple great set pieces though that allow opportunities for the level design to be more creative and one being a theme park of sorts for one of the TV shows in the game, which is mainly for the psychological themes to kick in. But that unfortunately get old by the 2nd and 3rd visit there. You should already be playing/ have finished this if you enjoyed the first one, and the ending gives some great mystery to where Max's life is going to head to next. I ONLY wish it was longer.                                                                                             9/10 :)			"

												So you wanna play probably the best Single-player shooter of all time then this game is for you. Max Payne 2 follows up right where you left in Max Payne and just kicks it up another notch to give you a sweet storyline and awesome gameplay. Take all that and add some pretty much flawless Bullet-time action and you got yourself an almost perfect game.It comes with several difficulties and a Survival mode (kinda)  for seemingly endless pleasure. Friends of a good shooter won't regret playing Max Payne 2. Just do yourself a favor and don't play the atrocity that is Max Payne 3.			"

												Very entertaining game. It's very short, can be beaten in under 6 hours. The story is interesting enough to keep you involved and moves fast enough to where you will never get bored. The combat is the best part of the game. You can enter ""bullet time"" where everything slows down around you and you can feel like a total badass. There is little replay value, I have no interest in playing it over again anytime soon, but if you can get this on sale, it is well worth it.			"

												Max Payne 1 & 2 are the greatest TPS games ever.  I play MP2 every year or two out of nostalgia.  The game still holds-up.  The weapons and combat are absolutely fantastic and are equaled by the story and voice acting.  Nothing else at the time (in FPS/TPS games anyway) made as much of an effort to present a great story.  Notable mention also goes to the fantastic score led by a solo cellist who is also a member of the cello metal group Apocalyptica.			"

												♥♥♥♥ SPEAKING OF THE WRITING TALENT BEHIND MAX PAYNE HERE'S A GAME THEY WROTEMAX PAYNE 2MAX ♥♥♥♥ING PAYNEOverall if you're only gonna play one game in the series I'd recommend the first Max Payne over this but this is a worthy sequel to the first game. It plays like a proper run-and-gun game eXCEPT YOU GET TO GO BULLET-TIME AND BE REALLY COOL AND MAKE IMPOSSIBLE ODDS VERY MANAGEABLE The writing is what I love the most, though (a smidge over the run-and-gun). because it's NOIR and they know how to do noir. I can't say much about the story without giving it away but just think noir with a protagonist that survives over-the-top odds (so basically noir adapted to a run-and-gun game). Very solid game. Remains one of my favorite game series to this day.			"

												While not my favorite entry in the Max Payne franchise, Max Payne 2 is still an excellent, though short game. The gameplay is inherently the same as the first title, though there are several changes to the trademark bullet time mechanic. For one thing, it can be used basically in every fight. As Max kills more enemies, time slows down even more, which also you to reload faster, in an appropriatly cinematic fashion. The visuals are also essentially the same as the first game, with the welcome addition of ragdoll physics- blowing random thugs away is much more satifying. The storytelling is again similar, with the comic book style cutscenes overlayed with Max's familiar deadpan. To me, the story is the best part of the game. It ties in closely to the original game and features many of the same characters. Without going into to much detail, there are many twists across the game's 5 to 6 hour length. The relationship between Max and Mona is especially good, though I wish the sequences where you play as her stood out a bit more, as she plays exactly the same as Max. Sam Lake's writing is solid and I would say a tad better than the first game, several of Max's quips are very poetic and the ending of the game left me thinking.All in all, I would recomend this game to any Max Payne fan, though I urge anyone to check of the first game before playing this one!

												I played both max payne 1&2 when they first came out and its amazing how they stand the test of time. The gameplay and even the graphics are very good. These games are not that open world a bit corridor driven but they certainly show up the bad points of some newer games. 9/10			"

												Max Payne 2 charts the adventures of the unfortunately named ""Max Payne"" as he goes through various monstrous locations in order to track down the Russians. While I empathise with this idea, I don't see the point in this game at all. The ""Russian"" thing has been done to death. Call of Duty has shown us that when you want to kill Russians, you send a good AMERICAN citizen like RAMIREZ in, not some cop with a bad hair cut like Max Pain. Worse still, the game attempts to make the horrible pun ""Paynekillers"" as the healing mechanic, which indicates that the game is DEVOID OF HUMOUR, not like the jokes that the cast of Call of Duty make.I'd recommend this game only to the psychopaths of the world and the idiots of the world, because if you like this game you're one of the two.

												I came across Max Payne 2 on accident. And let me tell you in all sincerety this is one of the greatest games of all time in my book. The thing is it's a an actual narrative story, not just some shooter game. It's like a movie you watch more than once and you see the course of events in a whole new light. This was back when Remedy was still making the Max Payne games and it shows, the story is so top notch it's ridicuous. If you see this game on sale for less than 5 dollars on steam and you haven't played it, ♥♥♥♥in get it. It also has crazy♥♥♥♥♥mods that are really easy to install, trust me you wont regret it.			"

												As the next game in my Max Payne Marathon,I played Max Payne 2.  While this game can't hold a candle to modern games in terms of graphics, you can see an immense impovement in graphics. Weapons and gameplay is a lot more fluid and the difficulty has been reduced slightly.  If you're here after playing the first one. This game is worth a playthrough.If you're here and you have never played Max Payne, I'd still recommend the story. While you will be slightly confused when it comes to some plot points. There's nothing that relevant that isn't recapped by the old game for you.  It's a great buy especially for the few bucks you have to pay for it now.			"

												Never before and not since playing this game have I ever felt so much for a video game charcter. This is definitely the best of the Max Payne series with its compelling story. It does have its some flaws where you have to play through the story multiple times to get a challenge, but every time you play through you feel even more for Max. The theme song, Late Goodbye by Poets of the Fall, also fits in PERFECTLY with this game. 9/10			"

												My first memory  of Max Payne 2 is my father, in full concentration mode, getting absolutely massacred by men in balaclavas. I instantly wanted a go, and thusly my love for the franchise was born.  I died a lot, and never got past the second level. Good times!That was a long time ago, and I no longer suck at Max Payne. As much.The thing that really hits you about this game (rather like the shotgun pellets fired at Max) is the learning curve it requires. The first levels see an insomniac Max exchanging small arms fire with members of a cleaning company, but it quickly escalates into tense massacres featuring you versus the entire mafia. Don't worry, you might be ready for it!I won't ruin the storyline here, but it's bleak, absolutely beautiful and it inter-twines with the brilliant mechanics of the game well. No one can possibly dislike bullet-time diving around a corner as you dodge in between huge amounts of ordnance being flung your way by dangerously good enemies.You will die, you will get stuck. But as long as you don't mind chugging pain killers like mentos, re-loading every chance you get and aiming for the head, you'll be fine and have a great time.In my mind this game is one of Rockstar's best, darkest creations that deserves a special place in the heart of all gamers.Oh, and remember: The duel Ingrams are an absolute show stopper.Recommended for those who love to delve deep into a story and who are looking for an original experiance!

												Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne differs from the original Max Payne in many aspects. This one is darker. This is more like a movie than the other. This is more tragic and more twisted. This further expands in Max's mind and most of the stuff is about how he deals with the pain of his family's death. And it also packs more action than the previous one, featuring more violence. And more slow-motion gunplay.			"

												In terms of raw gameplay satisfaction you get from shooting bad guys, Max Payne 2 is pretty much has the best of what shooters have to offer. It's a rather simple and unremarkable tale told brilliantly and said tale never gets in the way of you having fun with the perfect shooting mechanics. Every gunfight is its own setpiece, every room full of henchmen is your slow-motion playground. Bar a few awkward platforming sequences, Max Payne 2 was stunning when it was released and you'd be completely justified buying it for $50. At $10? You're practically losing money by not getting it.			"

												Max Payne 2 took everything I loved about the first game and made it better. The graphics and engine get a nice overhaul, and there is still plenty of action to be had.While they did seem to cut down on the cutscenes, they added much more dialogue in between killing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. The game did seem to slow down much more when compared to Max Payne 1.  More sections of the game were added in between the story and action portions.Bullet time is back of course, and more satisfying to use.With its great story and fun combat, really is worth a try if you haven't yet.

												In contrast with its previous iteration, Max Payne 2 feels like an action crime-thriller rather than the paced noir style of the original. The production values increased, which is a positive note unless you miss Sam Lake's lovely constipated look as Max's face. The story is taken to a whole new level, with more twists and turns than the writer can throw Norse Mythology references at you. Just like the previous game, I really enjoyed the little touches like the TV shows (which you should watch) and continuity checks (Captain Baseball Bat Boy, how I have missed you!). This crime-thriller/action/ psychodrama is something I would always smooch with my bloody lips if I didn’t had to clean it afterwards. On a side-note, check out Alan Wake if you can, another Remedy game with the same lead voice actor, fantastic writing, and with some quirky references to the man who gave us a late goodbye.			"

												Many improvements comparing to the first one without sacrificing the dark essence and atmosphere. Great in every gameplay aspect, but the graphics are not the best (the characters looks great, but the scenarios are almost exactly as the first game). The only regretful thing is the plot. I understand that is a tale about lost and sorrow, but sometimes Max sounds like an emo, too melodramatic. However, the game is great, excellent I must say.			"

There's great action here and a lot of steps made to rectify problems from the first game.  It's still terribly short though; I beat it in just under 6 hours and I played pretty leisurely, taking in the conversations and little story bits here and there.Just to note; if you have Windows 7 or beyond, remember to dig into your steamapps folder and set up compatibility mode.

""In a nightmare, every choice you make is a wrong one.""Max Payne 2 is a direct sequel, continuing the titular character's grim tale. Now a police detective, Max is thrust into a conspiracy involving a group of hitmen known as the ""Cleaners."" In the process of digging up their identity, he comes across Mona Sax, a femme fatale he assumed had been dead for two years. Making an unlikely duo, they work together to uncover dark secrets and create new ones.+The action is even better this time. The first game set the bar with its bullet time mechanics, and the sequel works to apply a fine polish. Now, during slowdown, you can quickly reload with a stylish spin, allowing you to pull of some impressive clears. All the guns handle well and the controls are precise. There wasn't a bad action sequence in this game.+Stellar plot. Max and Mona's complex relationship adds a layer of intrigue to the mystery. Given their nature--one a cop, one a criminal--the story chooses to test how far they will go to aid each other. Like all good noir stories, there is romance, betrayal, violence, and overwhelming darkness. It's a short story, but the plot is solid, an improvement from the previous title. This time to graphic novel style looks a little better in appearance, and isn't as overwhelmed with tiresome metaphors.+Attention to detail. Contrary to the last game, Max Payne 2 has some wonderful environments. Back alleys, drug dens, funhouses, police stations; it's much more varied this time. While it remains a linear game, there is plenty to explore and uncover. Every stage has television sets that you can interact with. Each features a handful of shows that will reoccur throughout the game. They are very campy in nature and tend to have parallels with Max's own situation, revealing how silly the plot can sound without the dark overtones. It's clear that the game isn't afraid to make fun of itself, and that makes the experience easy to appreciate.-Game length. It only took about five hours to beat the game. At 9.99 this is no issue. It's well worth the money. But at the same time, this game was once sold at full retail price. There are plenty of modes to replay the game with, but I'm not sure if it would have warranted a full purchase. I don't want to undersell how much I loved the game (it has to be one of the best games I've ever played), but it was almost too short. The first game had a good length, and this one was about three hours short of that. That said, nothing in the game feels like a waste of time. There is no padding to be found. Everything that occurs moves the plot along efficiently. It's unfortunate that such a good experience only lasts for such a short time, but I understand the reasoning.-Glitches. There was one level, an escort mission, that I had issues with due to a glitch. The character I was protecting would not go through a doorway, and continued to get stuck even when I restarted the mission. It took a bit of fiddling around to manage to get him through (I basically had to use the door to smash him through the doorway). This was the only part of the game I had issues with, but it did dampen my experience. Without this moment of annoyance, Max Payne 2 could've been an entirely perfect game. It's strange to witness, as the rest of the game seems technically astounding.Max Payne 2 is an incredible game. It puts most current-gen shooters to shame and has a story that is enjoyable from start to finish. The short length is a bit jarring, but the end result is a game that feels like a full experience. There is no useless filler to pad out the experience. Instead, Max Payne 2 leaves you feeling very satisfied by the end.Buy it. It's one of the best shooting games out there.			"

												Absolutely excellent game. Very good story, good graphics and physics (they have aged a little bit), and good game/level design. I highly recommend this game, but only if you've played Max Payne 1 (which introduced Bullet Time to video games) as the story in this game is a direct continuation. The ending is also badass, Max Payne endings are always very cool. The selection of weapons you have in this game are actually more limited in variety than in the prequel, there are no melee weapons and the M79 grenade launcher is gone from the original game. However, new weapons have been introduced to make up for this. These include the MP5, AK-47, M4 Carbine, Striker (obviously based on the real life DAO-12), and the Dragunov. Bullet Time and its role has been expanded upon. You can now reload weapons while in bullet time, via a stylish spin maneuver, and shootdodging no longer requires Adrenaline. In terms of replayability, there really isn't much. I still like to go back and replay Max Payne games sometimes, but that's just me. There is a new arcade mode called ""Dead Man Walking,"" but all it is about is surviving for as long as possible in small maps and trying to beat your score from last time. No multiplayer unfortunately. So to reiterate, Max Payne 2 is definitely worth your time, but only if you've played Max Payne 1 and you're fine with a game with little replay value (if you're not like me).			"

												This game takes Max Payne from dark humor to a depressing slog trying to find something to hold onto in this world.  Despite the story which becomes increasingly depressing overtime, the game itself is still marvelous, featuring a much more immersive environment than what the first Max Payne could offer.  Many objects & even the ragdolls feature physics (which is commonly referred to as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ physics), allowing you to push explosive barrels around, send CSI masqeraders flying through the air, and even push boddies around like some drunk ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stumbling home from the bar.Unfortunately, this game does have problems.  No matter what OS you use, you will have to do something to make the game run correctly.  In the case of windows 7 and beyond, you will have to shut one or more of your core processors off in order to make the game run.  If you update the game, you won't be able to play it.  If you play on XP, you will have sound issues.Despite all of this, this is a game that I am sure you will love.  Come for the gameplay, and stay for the humor that's still present.			"

												If you want a simple shoot 'em up with matrix-like bullet time and a film noir plot then this is the game for you. Ok, the graphics are a little dated now but overall I'd still recommend this short, bullet-spewing romp.A couple of warnings - it is getting a little unstable with age. It was running fine until the few parts when it suddenly would no longer even start. Try using it in compatibility mode (Windows ME) and turning off anti-aliasing - that worked for me. Also a supporting character got stuck in a doorway to which the only solution was find a save game of the next chapter to download.			"

Use an extremely hard to do cheat, that replaces your character with a nude model of Mona Sax.  ;) Getting a headshot with a sniper rifle in the game is also fun, slow-motion bullet camera and everything (Includes a badass black version of Vin Diesel to help you fight bad guys)			"

I played this with a mod which made it like max payne 3 called Payne Evolution. I recommend it. It's better with a controller in my opinion as well. The story in Max Payne 3 felt more solid and complete whereas Max Payne 2's story was lacking. However I did like the more comic-booky feel to max payne 2.			"

												Max Payne 2 is a triumph in third-person shooters, building strongly upon the foundation built by it's predecessor. It makes no attempt to alter the gameplay, and didn't need to- the first game's action was solid, as was its atmosphere and music, both back in full force here (including a Poets of the Fall song) But it does expand Max's story in surprising directions. A mysterious assassin, thought dead. Old friends become new enemies. The machinations of powerful men, dwelling in shadow. And in the middle of it all, Max Payne is trapped, still madly running from his past and his memories, and desiring death, finds instead a reason to live again. But Max is the consumate Noir protagonist, a survivor, cursed to emerge unscathed from the fires of his personal hell again and again. We will see how just how far he can run when Max Payne 3 releases this coming March.			"

												Max Payne 2 is a third-person action game that follows the events of Max Payne 1. It depicts a broken Max seeking redemption and he gets this through the game's other main character, a femme fatale known as Mona Sax.Story: The game is basically a tragic love story between Max Payne and Mona Sax. Over the course of the game, Mona Sax is constantly on the run (for reasons you will find out in the game) and Max Payne, now an NYPD cop must pursue her. The more Max encounters Mona, the more he becomes infatuated with her and this creates an interesting dynamic between them. The story is well-told and interesting but not as poetic and dark as the original Max Payne.Graphics: I can't say much about the graphics given that it came out more than 10 years ago (in 2003). What I can say that the visuals are still servicable and okay for today's standards and I would imagine that the graphics at the time were ground-breaking. Not so much nowadays.Gameplay: The movement, gunplay and overall responsiveness in MP2 is much improved over Max Payne 1. Now you can equip an item like a grenade to another button, instead of needing to switch to it. Bullet time is back and it feels as good as ever. It is a lot of fun to activate Bullet Time and take out 3 to 4 enemies , and this really makes you feel like a badass. There is much less frustration to the controls this time round.Overall, Max Payne 2 is a great action game that I believe has stood the test of time and is still better than some action games of today.I'd give the game an 8.5/10.

												If you grab MP2 at a low price, it's makes for pretty decent run-and-gun fun. Make no mistake, the game is dated, and the AI and level design don't let you forget it. But activating your slo-mo ""bullet time"" and wiping out a squad of evil henchmen with any of several fun armaments is never going out of style. Just remember to save often, as you're liable to be ambushed by some deviously placed enemies almost anywhere, any time.			"

The past is a gaping hole. You try to run from it, but the more you run, the deeper, more terrible it grows behind you, its edges yawning at your heels. Your only chance is to turn around and face it. But it's like looking down into the grave of your love. Or kissing the mouth of a gun, a bullet trembling in its dark nest, ready to blow your head off.When you’re waking up, the world is a blur, what was clear in a dream suddenly makes no sense.

												Good game, It takes some time to get working on modern OS's but it's worth it.PRO's-Very enjoyable shooting.-Noir atmosphere.-Interesting story told through graphic novel cutscenes that aren't intrusive and can be skipped (unlike 3).-Physics and polished visuals make it nice to look at.-Multiple difficulty modes add replayability.-Good soundtrack.CON's-Short, really short, can be beaten in 5 hours if you dont die too often.-Bullet time is really overpowered, if you use it too often the game becomes a cake walk.-Again difficult to get working on modern systems, running win10 64-bit and had to run another prograam to force the game to run in DirectX8.People saying the story is bad don't know what they are talking about, it's told in a subtle way through level design and avoids exposition heavy dialouge, which already puts it above 90% of other games in terms of story telling. Without spoiling anything it's great to see how Max's mind is slowly unfolded throughout the course of the game.			"

												There are few games that I'd say they are a master of their genre. May Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is definitely one of them. I'd say it's the last of the good old games. Max Payne 2 is a strange specimen because it's between two periods, the old and the new. It has the charm of oldschool games while feeling modern and polished. The action is one of the best I've ever seen. The gameplay feels very cinematic, inspired by John Woo's motion pictures. But the best thing they've introduced since the first Max Payne is the physics engine. Enemies fall spectacularly when they die, especially in slow motion, and you can even jump into them and drive them to the floor.The visual novel style cutscenes are back from the first game along with the heavy noir atmosphere. This time I fell like they've put a bit more emphasis on the detective aspects of the story which I personally love, and it's still every bit as thrilling as the first game (if not more). The music is great and strengthens the tension in the atmosphere, but the guns sound a little off to me. The main problem with the game is that it's too short in my opinion, but with the challenge modes making a return, and given the exquisite gameplay, I think you'll find yourself playing this game over and over again.I can't recommend this enough. Go buy it! 10/10			"

												A beautiful example on how to do a video game sequel. Now while the story isn't quite as memorable as that of its predecessor and the gameplay is only marginally improved, it is the brilliance in which Remedy and Sam Lake spin this tale of noir tragedy through (once again) thoroughly memorable visuals, brilliant set pieces, and fantastic voice acting. Top it off with an utterly amazing and emotional soundtrack and you have one of those prime candidates for ""sequels that better the original"" debate.			"

												Playing this Game after I had played Max Payne 3...I liked some aspects of Max Payne 3 better. Max payne 3 had a better combat and bulletTime system. I played this with a mod which made it like max payne 3 called Payne Evolution. I recommend it. It's better with a controller in my opinion as well. The story in Max Payne 3 felt more solid and complete whereas Max Payne 2's story was lacking. However I did like the more comic-booky feel to max payne 2.			"

												Intermittent compatibility issues, certain tricks works for some people and doesn't for others. They shouldn't be releaasing defective goods and not refunding people when it doesn't work.Can't get it working despite the efforts of the steam communitys efforts fixes. It only cost €2.50 so i'm not that mad but still its payment for nothing.Buyer beware ,without official patch for Win7 and 8, it may not work.I played the game before and really enjoyed so I was looking forward to playing it again. Shame. I might try using oracle with XP as the os and see if that works			"

												Max Payne 2 shows no signs of letup from the original game with its fantastic combat and gameplay.  This sequel added another “co main character” Mona Sax, which you can play as and will affect the progress of Max throughout the game.  The unique characters and excellent voice acting really stand out.  I believe the main storyline is not as strong as the first game but it’s interesting nonetheless.  Along with the story, the only minor problem is the games length, being about half that of the original title.  Max Payne 2 is a great continuation of the series and a great game. 8.5			"

												the best max payne game in all 3,this[mp2] got the bullet time and the dive timing/countdown 100% accurate ,mp3 use back mp1 timing,and take cover to replenish bullet time meter? that is lame.the only thing i need to do to run this game is run it in compatibility mode 98/me,thats it.but the steam version is actually an V1.0 ,rockstar/remedy officially release the 1.01 quite some time ago,why steam dint got any patch update? i dont know.1.01 will only work on the dvd/box version,if u patch it on the steam version,u will have to use a no cd crack/patch thingy,and u cant start it on steam library.same thing,ive done it on 1 sitting before,and ive done it again, just like mp1,this is the game that should be done on 1 sitting,no zzz ,no rest,no 'i was afraid to go on' BS.the voice acting for the comic/cutscene section if much more better compare to mp1[its already good in mp1,they got it perfect in mp2].get your painki.....caffeine ready and go through the night. 9/10 . 1 point short because of the last boss battle,its not epic enough.

												Max Payne 2 is a triumph in third-person shooters, building strongly upon the foundation built by it's predecessor. It makes no attempt to alter the gameplay, and didn't need to- the first game's action was solid, as was its atmosphere and music, both back in full force here (including a Poets of the Fall song) But it does expand Max's story in surprising directions. A mysterious assassin, thought dead. Old friends become new enemies. The machinations of powerful men, dwelling in shadow. And in the middle of it all, Max Payne is trapped, still madly running from his past and his memories, and desiring death, finds instead a reason to live again. But Max is the consumate Noir protagonist, a survivor, cursed to emerge unscathed from the fires of his personal hell again and again. We will see how just how far he can run when Max Payne 3 releases this coming March.			"

												  This game is absolutely wonderful. Everything, from the graphics to the storyline, all meshes into an almost perfect experience. The gunplay is satisfying, the story is intriguing, and the level design flows you from each combat scenario to the next. The story continues from where the first one left off, and while I recommend that you play that one first, I love that Max Payne 2 can stand alone as its own story, and I personally think that the story is better than the first. Along with the story, everything else is improved. The graphics are way better (The faces are much improved), bullet time is more useful because you move the same speed as everyone else moves slower, and guns have more heft, and if you can kill enemies in one hit if you get a headshot. Overall, I think Max Payne 2 is the perfect sequel; improving everything from the original while still keeping the spirit of the first one.10/10 "

												While not as good as its predecessor, it's still a very good offering.The shot sound effects have been made more realistic, but it makes them sound a bit impotent.A pistol that goes 'pak-pak' is not quite as satisfying as the movie-like 'bang! bang!'.Some of the bullet streak rendering has been replaced with just enlarged flying slugs, which was disappointing.The level design is solid and interesting. The light-maps and texturing are done well.The story is pretty good, albeit a bit loose. It feels as though it needed an extra week or two with the editor, to help tighten up the flow.Overall, a title with many flaws, but a solid fun romp through Max Payne's noir world.			"

												Max Payne one was a good game. Max Payne 2 is a great game. Max payne two does everything right, the first got wrong. Max`s face isnt constipated. The gunplay is fun and challenging. Ragdoll physics (which were new and amazing at the time) are a great addition to slow mo gun fights.  The plot is fantastic. The cutscenes are even cooler than the original`s.  And there are some very cool mind♥♥♥♥ segments.  I`d reccomend this game to anyone who is a fan of the first game, or anyone who wants a fun, challenging action game experience.  And at it`s current price, you have no excuse!			"

												As the next game in my Max Payne Marathon,I played Max Payne 2.  While this game can't hold a candle to modern games in terms of graphics, you can see an immense impovement in graphics. Weapons and gameplay is a lot more fluid and the difficulty has been reduced slightly.  If you're here after playing the first one. This game is worth a playthrough.If you're here and you have never played Max Payne, I'd still recommend the story. While you will be slightly confused when it comes to some plot points. There's nothing that relevant that isn't recapped by the old game for you.  It's a great buy especially for the few bucks you have to pay for it now.			"

												Picking up the story two years after the events of the first game, Max has cleared his name and is now an NYPD detective. A disorientating start leads to a well-crafted story with the return of several characters from the first game.Max Payne 2 continues the sense of atmosphere through a major rainstorm, richly detailed locations, exciting gunfights and nicely realised TV programmes, Address Unknown being my favourite. With better production values, a good story, a more professional script, and better acting and graphics, the game is Max Payne as he should be - a complex character full of conflict.Slightly let down by being too short, The Fall of Max Payne is still one of my favourite ever games.

The weapons and combat are absolutely fantastic and are equaled by the story and voice acting.  Nothing else at the time (in FPS/TPS games anyway) made as much of an effort to present a great story.  Notable mention also goes to the fantastic score led by a solo cellist who is also a member of the cello metal group Apocalyptica.			"

												My first memory  of Max Payne 2 is my father, in full concentration mode, getting absolutely massacred by men in balaclavas. I instantly wanted a go, and thusly my love for the franchise was born.  I died a lot, and never got past the second level. Good times!That was a long time ago, and I no longer suck at Max Payne. As much.The thing that really hits you about this game (rather like the shotgun pellets fired at Max) is the learning curve it requires. The first levels see an insomniac Max exchanging small arms fire with members of a cleaning company, but it quickly escalates into tense massacres featuring you versus the entire mafia. Don't worry, you might be ready for it!I won't ruin the storyline here, but it's bleak, absolutely beautiful and it inter-twines with the brilliant mechanics of the game well. No one can possibly dislike bullet-time diving around a corner as you dodge in between huge amounts of ordnance being flung your way by dangerously good enemies.You will die, you will get stuck. But as long as you don't mind chugging pain killers like mentos, re-loading every chance you get and aiming for the head, you'll be fine and have a great time.In my mind this game is one of Rockstar's best, darkest creations that deserves a special place in the heart of all gamers.Oh, and remember: The duel Ingrams are an absolute show stopper.Recommended for those who love to delve deep into a story and who are looking for an original experiance!

												I first played and completed Max Payne in 2001, the year of its year of release. I now came back to it to play on my lap top, in my free time when I'm bored. Rockstar games never get old. Great gameplay, smooth controls, great story, characters, wide choice of weapons, and ofcourse the most important... the slow motion feature. Brings back the memories. One of the best action games of all time. Thank you Rockstar.			"

												The ending scene was so impressed.  last words gave me chills down.not only ending, but each scene is just amazing. Max Payne feelings and emotions are constantly described by lyrical words.so we can understand the character's mentality and concentrate on character. This game had the best narrative in a game I have ever seen. ﻿I think it's better than 3.			"

												Max Payne 2 shows no signs of letup from the original game with its fantastic combat and gameplay.  This sequel added another “co main character” Mona Sax, which you can play as and will affect the progress of Max throughout the game.  The unique characters and excellent voice acting really stand out.  I believe the main storyline is not as strong as the first game but it’s interesting nonetheless.  Along with the story, the only minor problem is the games length, being about half that of the original title.  Max Payne 2 is a great continuation of the series and a great game. 8.5			"

												The story and dialogue are fantastic. There are also TV's that you can find with cheesy TV shows that strangely reflect Max's life including Captain Baseball-Batboy, Lords and Ladies, and Address Unknown. I found myself stopping to watch them just like Night Springs shows in Alan Wake. The default difficulty is also less cheap compared to Max Payne 1. It gets really tough near the end but never super bad like in Max Payne 1. The game also looks really good for a game made in 2003, they really future-proofed it like Valve did (except that you have to force anti-aliasing through your graphics card and run in in 98/ME compatibility mode). This game also has Havok Physics which makes for hilarious ragdoll effects after explosions. If you liked Alan Wake get this game.			"

												This is the apex of the entire series, and even works with Windows 7. The story, writing, and characters were the best of its time, right next to Mafia I. Still, it holds its own even against modern games. The game aged really well, with the exception of the save system since this is from an era where quicksaves every 5 minutes didn't exist.

												I played the original Max Payne when it was first release [and I still use the free mouse pad that came with the box! (had to wash it a few times)]. I thought the first game was fun but I put off playing the sequal because I never heard much about it. Well, I finally played through the game and actually enjoyed it. It's rather short, the graphics are a bit dated and the story arch wasn't as epic as the first (going off of memory here), but it brought back some good memories of playing the original Max Payne. If you liked the first one I suggest you give this a shot, otherwise you'd be better off trying the original.			"

												These games aren't very long, and I think that's satisfactory. Took me seven hours to beat.  I think Remedy's focus on the Max Payne games is purely the storyline. Gameplay doesn't suffer, of course, but the point of these games is to tell Max's life, which means that you're going to have bits and pieces where you play and pay attention to what the characters are saying as well as the setting Max is in, rather than looking to kill someone or find something. This is a great sequel to Max Payne, in my opinion. I was worried that I was going to dislike it, but not much has changed in the way of mechanics or otherwise, and I like that they didn't overhaul much but how people looked. I did have one odd issue with the game though, after Mona's first level I seemed to have some kind of invincibility up until the last chapter.			"

												The second entry in the Max Payne series by Remedy Games and later, Rockstar. It begins two years after the last game, with the eponymous Max Payne having left the DEA in the wake of his rampage. He is then drawn into another conspiracy, this time with a femme fatale as an ally. The gameplay is standard Max Payne-fare: shoot it up. It is an enjoyable third-person shooter, utilizing the same bullet time gimmick as the first game. The mechanic is now improved, being longer as well as more ""fun"". A healthy addition to the series is the implementation of Havok physics, meaning that enemies now ragdoll upon death.The game is about 8-10 hours long, depending on how much time you invest into listening to voicemails. In my opinion, it is significantly shorter than the first game. However, this should not deter you from playing this masterpiece.			"

												I cannot recommend this game enough to those who love a bit of bullet-time third person action or who enjoy noir, or even just those who enjoy a damn good plot in a videogame!Simply put; breathtaking. Detailed to the extreme (in game interactive objects at a all time high), a story which weaves in and out of solid and lucid thoughts, mysteries and plot twists. Done so much more personally then the original, and so much more polished. I won't ruin some of the great moments but there are many in such a short space of time.Graphics are superb holding up today, and great comic interludes move the plot along really well; witty and well written, almost entirely poetic (and of course hugely over the top in places as it should be!).The greatest problem is perhpas the speed you might go through it - but every moment is wonderfully done, more a modern noir-detective-action then most films could ever be.

Two annoyances: there is no patch for widescreen monitors (apparently, resolution was like, hardcoded or something so it's next to impossible to fix), so unless you happen to have a monitor that you can set to display  4:3, Max is gonna look pretty fat.

												In my opinion, this is the best Max Payne game of the series, and it holds up surprisingly well given its age. Released alongside titles such as Call of Duty, Beyond Good and Evil, and Knights of the Old Republic, Max Payne 2 suffered the same issue as Psychonauts: a great game with great reviews, although nobody bought it. The gameplay and gun mechanics are only really comparable to the original Max Payne (another great game that has aged well), except they're much tighter and more refined. The infamous Bullet Time ability works quite well here, and the shoot-dodging mechanic is almost perfected. The weapons all work fairly well, although the pistols and shotguns become a little too situational to be practical at the end of the game. The story itself is fairly cut and dry, although the Noir comicbook style of storytelling gives the game it's real charm. Unlike the first Max Payne, the comicbook segments are intercut with cutscenes which serve only to enhance the overall experience. The gameplay has enough variety to remain fairly fresh through its runtime, including pseudo-escort missions which don't actually suck. The biggest criticism this game received was its short length, and, too be fair, that's not too far off the mark. In comparison to the original game, this one is certainly shorter, although this has the added benefit of substantial pacing. The environments are varied enough to be quite distinct (an attribute many modern games can't compare to), and the comparatively shorter length helps make this game an easy pill to swallow.To anyone interested in the Max Payne series (and, if you like artistic games, well crafted single player storytelling, or fine-tuned slow-mo gun battles you should be), this is the crown jewel, although this game can be best appreciated after a playthrough of the original game for context and a better understanding of how this game's engine improved significantly in two years. The third installment, Max Payne 3, is certainly fun in its own right as well, although, with so many little things changed, altered, and tweaked, it simply doesn't give as good of an appreciation of the Max Payne franchise that this game can provide.

												Today, after a long time playing this game, I listened its theme song again and all memories about the good old days came back inside me. Therefore, I decided to make a review about this game, a game which, in my opinion, is the best third-person shooter game of 2003. If you liked the first one, you will LOVE this one! Can be considered as one of the most atmospheric and immersive TPS ever made, Max Payne 2 has a great riveting story like a noir graphic novel. It is also a heart-breaking story of loss and revenge.Besides, it also has good AI with convenient controls and especially great voice-acting. I really love the voice of Max Payne and Mona Sax.BUY THIS GAME! I'm sure you will have the same feelings like me after playing this game.A great ""FILM"" that you need to ""WATCH""!			"

The theme song, Late Goodbye by Poets of the Fall, also fits in PERFECTLY with this game. 9/10			"

												I finally found my way to ""Max Payne 3"", and as preparation before the third installment, I decided to revisit the first two games to brush up on the story, get in the right mood, and simply to see if they still hold up as well as I remembered them. They do. In fact, they're even better, with me being a more mature gamer and properly appreciating the work of art that is the MP franchise. After being done with MP1, I jumped to MP2, which is also the first MP title I ever played and a such holds a special spot in my gaming heart.Is it a sequel worthy of the first game? Yes, yes it is. 100%, and then some. Basically, all that was bad in MP1 was fixed in MP2, and all that was good was made better. MP2 features even better comic book style narrations. The script is equally well-written as before. In addition, the game now has proper cutscenes which provide a good transition between some scenes.Gameplay-wise, the tempo has been balanced a bit. Instead of the relentless onslaught, there are sections in MP2 which are exploratory only. The infamous dream-like sequences have been remodeled and made far less frustrating. Bullet time has undergone a few subtle changes, all for the better. There are some graphical improvements and fancy animations, of course, but the most important one is in the gameplay mechanic. Remember how in MP1 you would shoot-dodge (that is, dive in bullet time) and if you weren't able to clear the room of enemies in that one slow-mo leap, you'd be forced to watch an animation of Max standing up, during which he'd be powerless - and most likely dead, considering MP1's punishing difficulty. Now, after shoot-dodging, Max can remain down, firing his guns from a prone position. This makes a world of difference.The game's difficulty has also been adjusted. That is not to say the game is easy. You'll still die, but nowhere nearly as often as before. Quick save is still present, but it won't be your #1 button anymore. I admit the adjusted difficulty made for a more enjoyable and fluid experience. And for those wanting an extra challenge, there are tougher difficulties to choose from once you beat the game - including unlocking and alternate ending for beating the game on the highest difficulty.And lastly, visually, for a game 11 years old, MP2 is stunning, and only the most shallow gamers would condemn it for ""looking bad"".MP2 is a must-play game for anyone who deems himself a lover of 3rd person shooters - or simply great games in general.

												Despite not being quite up to the high standards the first chapter set, this is still an enjoyable and immersive game that fans of the first one should play. The slightly improved graphics and ability to play as a different character in some sections add to the experience. It maintains the gritty neo-noir style of MP1 (with more of a romance this time), minus the f*cked up nightmare drug sequences. There are still moments of delirium but they are noticeably less disturbing (no vertigo corridoors with murdered infant screams echoing around you). This game appears to be set a few years after the first, the more aged Max now resembles Bryan Ferry in a leather coat mowing down gangsters with a large arsenal of weapons. As in the first game the graphic novel storyboard style of cutscenes is a really good idea for advancing the story. Admittedly this does feel like a bit of a retread without any serious expansion, but anyone who played the first one will know how well the formula worked, as is likely to enjoy it just as much. Recommended.			"

												The story across all Max Payne games is a bit preposterous and heavy-handed. Yet, the characters and dialouge are some of the most grounded and well written in the medium. If you are looking for a hard-boiled action game with a psychological edge, this is your game. Max Payne 2 is a worthy sequel of the original. Not much has changed albeit some improved shooting mechanics, but that's a good thing. Buy it, you'll be coming back for seconds.			"

												Max Payne 2 is a triumph in third-person shooters, building strongly upon the foundation built by it's predecessor. It makes no attempt to alter the gameplay, and didn't need to- the first game's action was solid, as was its atmosphere and music, both back in full force here (including a Poets of the Fall song) But it does expand Max's story in surprising directions. A mysterious assassin, thought dead. Old friends become new enemies. The machinations of powerful men, dwelling in shadow. And in the middle of it all, Max Payne is trapped, still madly running from his past and his memories, and desiring death, finds instead a reason to live again. But Max is the consumate Noir protagonist, a survivor, cursed to emerge unscathed from the fires of his personal hell again and again. We will see how just how far he can run when Max Payne 3 releases this coming March.			"

												An unbelievably good game, definitely one of the best games I have ever played.The best gunplay and combat of any game ever made, hands down. All the weapons are powerful enough to be satisfying and are balanced out so that every gun has a reason to be used. The slow motion adds more flavor to the combat and all the different dives and dodges are definitely entertaining to watch.The story continues in the same fashion as the original Max Payne and while I prefer the original storyline, Max Payne 2 certainly still has a story worth paying attention to.

												Max Payne 2 continues the same formula of its predecessor. That is, heavy focus on storytelling, dark/adult themes and of course action packed gameplay. Sadly, it does not reach the success of MP1. The story just as expected is about crime, mafia infiltration, vengeance, violence and guild. In my opinion, the storytelling of MP2 feels a bit forced and overall just shallow compared to that of MP1. Maybe that is because MP1's story was so much richer with more characters, while MP2 focuses mainly on Max Payne character's inner struggle. Another thing I disliked is the addition of the love story of MP with a female character from the first game. It basically becomes the main theme of the game and I think that was unnecessary. At least it provides some enjoyable parts of gameplay in the later stages of the game, as you have to control both of the characters at some point which was maybe the highlight of the game.No big additions were made on the gameplay and the mechanics of the game. A couple more guns and some fancy slow motion maneuver and that is all. I was hoping they had fixed the trial and error aspect of the previous game but it’s still there. This is the biggest drawback of the Max Payne series in my opinion. You basically are forced to abuse the save/load option in order to stand a chance, as it is impossible to complete the game without mapping out all your opponents.The overall sound and graphics are an improvement from MP1 and especially the music. The soundtrack is a killer. Also, the game feels more polished and detailed.All in all while MP2 does a decent job you really have to be an old school player to enjoy this one. It is brutally unforgiving punishing your every mistake. I am sure the newer generations of players would probably brake their monitor out of frustration playing the Max Payne series. To be fair however, MP2 was released in 2003 and was quite ahead of its time. Even now I would rate it as a good action shooter with a unique story presentation. "

												Max Payne 1 & 2 are the greatest TPS games ever.  I play MP2 every year or two out of nostalgia.  The game still holds-up.  The weapons and combat are absolutely fantastic and are equaled by the story and voice acting.  Nothing else at the time (in FPS/TPS games anyway) made as much of an effort to present a great story.  Notable mention also goes to the fantastic score led by a solo cellist who is also a member of the cello metal group Apocalyptica.			"

Then comes the firefights and the meeting of and ""old friend"", Vlad!Without saying too much about the story, if you loved MP1, you will absolutely dig MP2. The graphics, animations, story, level design, gameplay... everything is improved from MP1.Compared to MP1, the bullet time gauge refills much faster which makes the firefights easier but more frantic.MP2, easier than MP1 but nonetheless, amazing sequel.Worthy 9/10			"

												Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne differs from the original Max Payne in many aspects. This one is darker. This is more like a movie than the other. This is more tragic and more twisted. This further expands in Max's mind and most of the stuff is about how he deals with the pain of his family's death. And it also packs more action than the previous one, featuring more violence. And more slow-motion gunplay.			"

												In terms of raw gameplay satisfaction you get from shooting bad guys, Max Payne 2 is pretty much has the best of what shooters have to offer. It's a rather simple and unremarkable tale told brilliantly and said tale never gets in the way of you having fun with the perfect shooting mechanics. Every gunfight is its own setpiece, every room full of henchmen is your slow-motion playground. Bar a few awkward platforming sequences, Max Payne 2 was stunning when it was released and you'd be completely justified buying it for $50. At $10? You're practically losing money by not getting it.			"

												Max Payne 2 took everything I loved about the first game and made it better. The graphics and engine get a nice overhaul, and there is still plenty of action to be had.While they did seem to cut down on the cutscenes, they added much more dialogue in between killing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. The game did seem to slow down much more when compared to Max Payne 1.  More sections of the game were added in between the story and action portions.Bullet time is back of course, and more satisfying to use.With its great story and fun combat, really is worth a try if you haven't yet.

												I probably love Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne as much as the first game in series. To keep it short, everything that was already god-tier, remained as good as possible or is even better. Every encounter with enemies is fun, killing them while using slowmo, or without it, is Max of fun. Characters, story and music stays for very long time in memory. Heck, even after playing it again for the first time in 10+ years I haven't forget many stuff. Maybe after so many time I started to think that story in this game is much darker than in previous one. Comics like always are interesting but for some reason, I really missed style used in first game. But for this little Payne, we got something much more amazing - MONA SAX. How fun it is to play here, to move her beatiful body. Probably one of my first gaming loves that never ended. Many years ago there was also special mod... who played Max Payne 2 back then will know what kind of mod I'm talking about. Wasn't dissapointed when I got my hands on this mod, even tho you could call this The Fall nowadays, I didn't regret anything.There is also this amazing game mode where you fight waves of enemies - I remember how many times I played this together with a friend of mine. To show-off who really is better, who reached the 5th minute for the first time, who managed to kill more enemies (yes, while one was playing the other one was counting dead bodies). Really great times and memories.It's not only nostalgia, Max Payne 2 is really great game. Some people will prefer the first one, some this one, but I really love both of Max Payne games and can't really think which one is better. If you enjoyed the previous one, if you want more, get it and play it. Few difficulty modes, additional game mode and beating each of chapters of game as fast as you can will bring you many hours of fun. I'm sure that there will be time when I will once again play this masterpiece.			"

""In a nightmare, every choice you make is a wrong one.""Max Payne 2 is a direct sequel, continuing the titular character's grim tale. Now a police detective, Max is thrust into a conspiracy involving a group of hitmen known as the ""Cleaners."" In the process of digging up their identity, he comes across Mona Sax, a femme fatale he assumed had been dead for two years. Making an unlikely duo, they work together to uncover dark secrets and create new ones.+The action is even better this time. The first game set the bar with its bullet time mechanics, and the sequel works to apply a fine polish. Now, during slowdown, you can quickly reload with a stylish spin, allowing you to pull of some impressive clears. All the guns handle well and the controls are precise. There wasn't a bad action sequence in this game.+Stellar plot. Max and Mona's complex relationship adds a layer of intrigue to the mystery. Given their nature--one a cop, one a criminal--the story chooses to test how far they will go to aid each other. Like all good noir stories, there is romance, betrayal, violence, and overwhelming darkness. It's a short story, but the plot is solid, an improvement from the previous title. This time to graphic novel style looks a little better in appearance, and isn't as overwhelmed with tiresome metaphors.+Attention to detail. Contrary to the last game, Max Payne 2 has some wonderful environments. Back alleys, drug dens, funhouses, police stations; it's much more varied this time. While it remains a linear game, there is plenty to explore and uncover. Every stage has television sets that you can interact with. Each features a handful of shows that will reoccur throughout the game. They are very campy in nature and tend to have parallels with Max's own situation, revealing how silly the plot can sound without the dark overtones. It's clear that the game isn't afraid to make fun of itself, and that makes the experience easy to appreciate.-Game length. It only took about five hours to beat the game. At 9.99 this is no issue. It's well worth the money. But at the same time, this game was once sold at full retail price. There are plenty of modes to replay the game with, but I'm not sure if it would have warranted a full purchase. I don't want to undersell how much I loved the game (it has to be one of the best games I've ever played), but it was almost too short. The first game had a good length, and this one was about three hours short of that. That said, nothing in the game feels like a waste of time. There is no padding to be found. Everything that occurs moves the plot along efficiently. It's unfortunate that such a good experience only lasts for such a short time, but I understand the reasoning.-Glitches. There was one level, an escort mission, that I had issues with due to a glitch. The character I was protecting would not go through a doorway, and continued to get stuck even when I restarted the mission. It took a bit of fiddling around to manage to get him through (I basically had to use the door to smash him through the doorway). This was the only part of the game I had issues with, but it did dampen my experience. Without this moment of annoyance, Max Payne 2 could've been an entirely perfect game. It's strange to witness, as the rest of the game seems technically astounding.Max Payne 2 is an incredible game. It puts most current-gen shooters to shame and has a story that is enjoyable from start to finish. The short length is a bit jarring, but the end result is a game that feels like a full experience. There is no useless filler to pad out the experience. Instead, Max Payne 2 leaves you feeling very satisfied by the end.Buy it. It's one of the best shooting games out there.			"

												I first played and completed Max Payne in 2001, the year of its year of release. I now came back to it to play on my lap top, in my free time when I'm bored. Rockstar games never get old. Great gameplay, smooth controls, great story, characters, wide choice of weapons, and ofcourse the most important... the slow motion feature. Brings back the memories. One of the best action games of all time. Thank you Rockstar.			"

												The long and short of MP2: a great sequel, although on the shorter side of games. Nevertheless, the ride itself is intense, and does not depart from the feel of MP1. The cast and characters are back again, the noir is back, and the dialog is intense.Try and pick it up in the combo pack with MP1, otherwise, wait for it to go on sale, as the game is indeed quite short(most will finish it in a few hours...~4-5).

												Max Payne 2 is FAR better than Max Payne 1. I found this one on my PC to actually play cutscenes than MP1 did because MP1 is glitched where you cannot hear audio which should be fixed in the beginning. But anyways Max Payne 2 is amazing because for a beginner shooter on the PC I feel like this should be rewarded more than it is being rewarded. There are also some mods which make feel like MP3 which has my money as fast as I bought MP3. So I reccomend this because this very is improved much more than the orginal ""Max Payne"". I am now going to download that mod where it will feel like Max Payne 3. Which is a game I love on the 360.			"

												Yessss... Max Payne 2!!! Don't let my hours played fool you, It's about the 8th time I started playing it which should tell you enough. I'm very passionate about this game cause it's a true piece of art. Yes I said it, like its precursor it's very noticable that the developing team has had tons of fun and heart while making these games (unlike part 3 which rockstar F***'ed in my opinion). The fact alone that they tried to figure out the right style for the game, to make it all come together. The comics that tell you parts of the story in between, the great voice actors (GREAT!!.. VOICE!!.. ACTORS!!), the music, the long story which even ingame has carefully selected cinematic cutscenes..For the love of God if you never played this just buy the freakin' game already, even if it's not on sale!Besides all this Max Payne 2 was an innovating game bringing slow-motion bullettime to your pc, and it's a gem that can hold its name proudly between other timeless games. Now if you'd excuse me, I got a Max Payne mural to make in my bedroom (no it's not Max in sexy underwear). Oh, and make sure you watch the tv series in the game. There are many worlds inside this world. 9/10			"

												This game is a sequel to the previous. The story is connected, but you can play this without playing the first and not being lost in the middle of its story. I only found a ""let down"" with it: being shorter than the first Max Payne.But despite being shorter, this game has a good ""replay value"": you unlock 3 new difficulties when you finish the game for the first time, and it has mod support too.The biggest challenge to most of buyers is to make this game run in modern systems like Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 for example. Well, the solution which work for me was the one described in THIS DISCUSSION (just click here).And if you encounter some problems with the wide screen like stretching the image, you can use this fix from THIS SITE (just click here)[thirteenag.github.io].And don't use Anti Aliasing. Disable it in the config window launched by the game. If you want it, force it in your graphic card panel, or it may make the game crash at the cut scenes.My rating: 9/10.			"

												I had a dream of my wife.She was dead, but it was allright.Sometimes the game feels like its forcing you to see how mad sees himself as crazy and it looks like max is more of a madman poser rather than someone with actual mental issues. Other than that, the game is ♥♥♥♥ing perfect, although it felt like if max payne 1 had an end and period, this game doesn't feel like something stitched over to continue the plot. It feels natural, like if max didn't expect what happens after max payne 1 either. Gameplay is superb and the game is still seriously ♥♥♥♥ing hard, although less frustrant than max payne 1, and not because its easier. I am glad i bought it.			"

												Max Payne 2 is a great classic game, worth a visit if you've never played it before. If you don't know Max Payne, it is worth playing through the first one before tackling this game, as some story elements will not make sense.The difficulty is a bit uneven at times, but once you realize that you are meant to abuse the hell out of bullet time, things loosen up a bit. It can get repetitive bullet timing all over the place, but... bullet time is the gimmick here, so you're gonna have to abuse it.I remember when this game came out, it brought my PC to its knees. I used to run it at 640x480. Now... I had to do some tweaking to get it to work and look good. Not much was needed, but I did have to do a few things.			"

												Just two years after the first Max Payne (2001) was released, Remedy came up with their second creation of the series, Max Payne 2 (2003). This time they developed a game which had a whole lot of better graphics, upgraded game mechanics, more interesting level design, a bunch of new guns and an enhanced level of voice acting as well as an enhancend level of enemy AI. Anyhow, like it's predecessor, Max Payne 2 is also quite a fast-paced game. The guns introduced in the game have a good feel on them and while bullet time or shoot dodge is being used at the same time, it will double the enjoyment. Also, the enemies are not able to take ridiculous amount of bullets before they die anymore, which is a huge improvement on its own over the first Max Payne game. The gradually slowing bullet time is an awesome invention as it is easier for the player to handle big amount of opponents at the same time. The controllabilty of Max's moves is still going strong, the level of voice acting is great and because there is some improvements on the enemy AI, Max Payne 2 is a very enjoyable game at its best.Now, not only the game mechanics has been proven to be better in Max Payne 2 than they are in Max Payne 1, but also the graphics have taken a big leap forward. Overall the environmental texturing have gotten to a higher level. Max can see his own reflection and the faces seen in the game are more natural than they used to be in the previous Max Payne game. The cars are a bit more than just boxes on the wheels and the whole level design is much more interesting.Despite all the enhancements, the game is still all about running and shooting with no considerable variation between the firefights you encounter. The overall amount of usable guns is still quite low and the game will not last too long, as an average person who is playing the game through for the first time can beat the game in about 5 hours. Additional game modes seem to be quite useless to try as there is nothing to achieve by playing them. Also the original dark and gritty story has been swapped to a new and lame one, which is all about Max losing another loved one while also being betrayed by someone thought to be a friend of his. The dreams Max is experiencing while the story goes on have lost a big part of their original meaning as a source of dark and twisted feelings.After all there is a huge amount of improvements in Max Payne 2, even though the run and shoot part leaves still much to be desired along with some other downsides seen in the game. Throughout the game you can find some easter eggs, and the mods made for this game can offer you a lot of additional fun. To this date I have beaten Max Payne 2 six times: three times before I had it on Steam and three times after that, with every given difficulty option. Because the game is quite short, I ended up spending only about 30 hours by playing it and could still give it a go. In other words I don't regret the time I have spent playing on this game. If you liked the predecessor of Max Payne 2, without a doubt you will fall in love with this one. The quality has been guaranteed, even though some things mentioned above could have been made better.			"

A NYPD detective with nothing to lose, the illusive femme fatale, the charismatic but dangerous mobster and the corrupted, back-stabbing superior - this game has EVERYTHING.

												There are few games that I'd say they are a master of their genre. May Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is definitely one of them. I'd say it's the last of the good old games. Max Payne 2 is a strange specimen because it's between two periods, the old and the new. It has the charm of oldschool games while feeling modern and polished. The action is one of the best I've ever seen. The gameplay feels very cinematic, inspired by John Woo's motion pictures. But the best thing they've introduced since the first Max Payne is the physics engine. Enemies fall spectacularly when they die, especially in slow motion, and you can even jump into them and drive them to the floor.The visual novel style cutscenes are back from the first game along with the heavy noir atmosphere. This time I fell like they've put a bit more emphasis on the detective aspects of the story which I personally love, and it's still every bit as thrilling as the first game (if not more). The music is great and strengthens the tension in the atmosphere, but the guns sound a little off to me. The main problem with the game is that it's too short in my opinion, but with the challenge modes making a return, and given the exquisite gameplay, I think you'll find yourself playing this game over and over again.I can't recommend this enough. Go buy it! 10/10			"

												Max Payne 2 is a third-person action game that follows the events of Max Payne 1. It depicts a broken Max seeking redemption and he gets this through the game's other main character, a femme fatale known as Mona Sax.Story: The game is basically a tragic love story between Max Payne and Mona Sax. Over the course of the game, Mona Sax is constantly on the run (for reasons you will find out in the game) and Max Payne, now an NYPD cop must pursue her. The more Max encounters Mona, the more he becomes infatuated with her and this creates an interesting dynamic between them. The story is well-told and interesting but not as poetic and dark as the original Max Payne.Graphics: I can't say much about the graphics given that it came out more than 10 years ago (in 2003). What I can say that the visuals are still servicable and okay for today's standards and I would imagine that the graphics at the time were ground-breaking. Not so much nowadays.Gameplay: The movement, gunplay and overall responsiveness in MP2 is much improved over Max Payne 1. Now you can equip an item like a grenade to another button, instead of needing to switch to it. Bullet time is back and it feels as good as ever. It is a lot of fun to activate Bullet Time and take out 3 to 4 enemies , and this really makes you feel like a badass. There is much less frustration to the controls this time round.Overall, Max Payne 2 is a great action game that I believe has stood the test of time and is still better than some action games of today.I'd give the game an 8.5/10.

												If you grab MP2 at a low price, it's makes for pretty decent run-and-gun fun. Make no mistake, the game is dated, and the AI and level design don't let you forget it. But activating your slo-mo ""bullet time"" and wiping out a squad of evil henchmen with any of several fun armaments is never going out of style. Just remember to save often, as you're liable to be ambushed by some deviously placed enemies almost anywhere, any time.			"

The past is a gaping hole. You try to run from it, but the more you run, the deeper, more terrible it grows behind you, its edges yawning at your heels. Your only chance is to turn around and face it. But it's like looking down into the grave of your love. Or kissing the mouth of a gun, a bullet trembling in its dark nest, ready to blow your head off.When you’re waking up, the world is a blur, what was clear in a dream suddenly makes no sense. No surreal rescues. No easy, magic way out. But you are awake. "

My Humble Review This sequel to Max Payne 1 is just right after the first one, so you can imagine that the story will make a lot of sense if you played the first 1 and all I gotta say is that the story is just great, the graphics are much more improved than the first 1 would still recommend getting Payne Evolution Mod because it improves the graphics, guns, textures and more stuff even more so the game is more enjoyable, the only problem that I have with the game is that it's much shorter than the first 1, don't know why they decided to do that feels a bit rushed but, either way, they still managed to make the story great and not a disappointment like a lot of sequels to popular games.

If you liked the first game this is an absolute must play . I can also say that theres been a difficulty change and that this game was made easier and more fast paced but instead they made you fight more enemies at once.Great game!			"

												This game is a classic, and it still plays well. I definitely recommend picking it up and giving it a run (along with the first, if you haven't yet) before playing the third.Windows 10 tips:In the initial settings window, turn off anti-aliasing – it gave me an error whenever it was on.If you have the windowed-mode problem, open your task manager after opening the game and right click on the Max Payne 2 process. Press maximize. You may to fiddle with the ""Always on top"" setting for task manager, and you may have to do this every time – I did, it was my one annoyance. "

A NYPD detective with nothing to lose, the illusive femme fatale, the charismatic but dangerous mobster and the corrupted, back-stabbing superior - this game has EVERYTHING.

												These games aren't very long, and I think that's satisfactory. Took me seven hours to beat.  I think Remedy's focus on the Max Payne games is purely the storyline. Gameplay doesn't suffer, of course, but the point of these games is to tell Max's life, which means that you're going to have bits and pieces where you play and pay attention to what the characters are saying as well as the setting Max is in, rather than looking to kill someone or find something. This is a great sequel to Max Payne, in my opinion. I was worried that I was going to dislike it, but not much has changed in the way of mechanics or otherwise, and I like that they didn't overhaul much but how people looked. I did have one odd issue with the game though, after Mona's first level I seemed to have some kind of invincibility up until the last chapter.			"

												Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne differs from the original Max Payne in many aspects. This one is darker. This is more like a movie than the other. This is more tragic and more twisted. This further expands in Max's mind and most of the stuff is about how he deals with the pain of his family's death. And it also packs more action than the previous one, featuring more violence. And more slow-motion gunplay.			"

												In terms of raw gameplay satisfaction you get from shooting bad guys, Max Payne 2 is pretty much has the best of what shooters have to offer. It's a rather simple and unremarkable tale told brilliantly and said tale never gets in the way of you having fun with the perfect shooting mechanics. Every gunfight is its own setpiece, every room full of henchmen is your slow-motion playground. Bar a few awkward platforming sequences, Max Payne 2 was stunning when it was released and you'd be completely justified buying it for $50. At $10? You're practically losing money by not getting it.			"

												Max Payne 2 took everything I loved about the first game and made it better. The graphics and engine get a nice overhaul, and there is still plenty of action to be had.While they did seem to cut down on the cutscenes, they added much more dialogue in between killing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. The game did seem to slow down much more when compared to Max Payne 1.  More sections of the game were added in between the story and action portions.Bullet time is back of course, and more satisfying to use.With its great story and fun combat, really is worth a try if you haven't yet.

												Everything I said about Max Payne 1 applies here. Still a good game. Max Payne 2, however, invites you to shoot everyone in New York City -again- this time using PHYSICS. This game is a Havok Engine showcase with no sense of restraint. I love that.Max is constantly seeing images of his past in television, stories, hearing about it from people around him. The entire premise of the game is facing up to his past and getting the hell over it. Thus, making Max Payne 3 seems like a bit of a step back to me, but what do I know? I haven't played Max Payne 3.  (If I play Max Payne 3, I may come revise this.)Pay attention to detail in this game, therefore. Watch TV. Listen to conversations. Explore. Also shoot a great many people.It's good. Play it.			"

												A brutal sequel of an amazing game, its even better than the first one in everything aside the narrative, I enjoyed it a lot more than the original. Let's face it how many game sequals can claim this? Not many. The story, as in the original game, is progressed by some excellent graphic novel style cut scenes. The voice acting is again spot on. You are again inside Max's head. The combat ans gunplay in Max Payne 2 is outstanding, insane at times, the bullet time is extremely fun to play with, Max' dive is great for showing off and the bullet time reload is just .perfect. It's great because you'll be able to use these skills in several of different locations and scenarios. This brings us to another amazing element of the game. The level design is superb, there's a diverse range of atmospheres in which differ by a lot. Whether it's in a building, construction site or with blazing infernos beside you, the combat approach would most likely be different.Just, if you haven't already played Max Payne 2 already, just go and look very hard for it, this game is one of the old school titles which you would regret missing. Also make sure no one ruins it for you. Its a true PC game and easily one on the best TPS serie ever.			"

That's how I felt when I learned Max Payne 2 was in development.The first game was so good, the story so great that I felt there was no where left to take the character, that his story was finished. How wrong I was! Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is the next logical step in this character's story. This isn't a rehash of the original, sure the gameplay and graphics have been refined, but the story is fresh and exciting.

												I probably love Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne as much as the first game in series. To keep it short, everything that was already god-tier, remained as good as possible or is even better. Every encounter with enemies is fun, killing them while using slowmo, or without it, is Max of fun. Characters, story and music stays for very long time in memory. Heck, even after playing it again for the first time in 10+ years I haven't forget many stuff. Maybe after so many time I started to think that story in this game is much darker than in previous one. Comics like always are interesting but for some reason, I really missed style used in first game. But for this little Payne, we got something much more amazing - MONA SAX. How fun it is to play here, to move her beatiful body. Probably one of my first gaming loves that never ended. Many years ago there was also special mod... who played Max Payne 2 back then will know what kind of mod I'm talking about. Wasn't dissapointed when I got my hands on this mod, even tho you could call this The Fall nowadays, I didn't regret anything.There is also this amazing game mode where you fight waves of enemies - I remember how many times I played this together with a friend of mine. To show-off who really is better, who reached the 5th minute for the first time, who managed to kill more enemies (yes, while one was playing the other one was counting dead bodies). Really great times and memories.It's not only nostalgia, Max Payne 2 is really great game. Some people will prefer the first one, some this one, but I really love both of Max Payne games and can't really think which one is better. If you enjoyed the previous one, if you want more, get it and play it. Few difficulty modes, additional game mode and beating each of chapters of game as fast as you can will bring you many hours of fun. I'm sure that there will be time when I will once again play this masterpiece.			"

												Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is a great game, having played it for many years I got excited when I saw that it was on steam. It is quite an old game (2003, I believe. I am a fan of old games, for some reason) however it is still one of the best games that I have ever played. The storyline of Max Payne is complex but as you begin to play the game you will understand a bit of what it going on, the characters are well thought out and the missions can be quite fun, reading through the graphic novel function is interesting as instead of having cutscenes, the plot is shown through a graphic novel. You also encounter things like TVs and you can view the ingame TV shows.However, there are some downsides to the game also such as,Sometimes a bit of it can be hard to follow and you don't know what is happening/why the mission relates to the game.Despite the graphic novel being entertaining, it can be a bit slow and you can get bored of it however there is a skip button if you aren't interested in the game.The last downside is minor but in my opinion the game is quite short, it only took me 7 hours to finish and it would have been a bit better if there were a few more missions.Overall I rate this game an 9/10, it is a great game to play and I would recommend it to anyone.

												In my opinion this game is in most aspects an improvement over the original. But be warned: Steam version is as bad as Max Payne 1. If you have an OS that is newer than Windows XP, you will need to find and install some fixes for the game to even run, and then some more to fix the sounds issues and give it proper widescreen support.After you get it up and running properly, expect the following:- This game is much, much easier than the original Max Payne. Probably not too easy, but at least you will suffer much less cheap deaths, especially instant ones. Aiming is still hindered by forced vSync, but feels significantly more fluid than in previous game. There are harder modes for more challenge, but you need to beat it on default difficulty first.- Combat feels less luck-based and more dependent on player's actual skill. Enemies, however, are not as mobile as in MP1, but still move around quite a bit. Weapons are rebalanced and are more diverse and shooting feels, for a lack of better term, just better. However, in most situations the player is stocked with enormous amount of weapons and ammo, which is nice from the variety perspective, but it also means that there is only a handful of instances where ammo conservation is a thing. The boss battle is also much more interesting.- Physics are improved and expanded. There is semi-decent ragdoll in place now, and there's a lot of reactive clutter all over the levels, which adds quite a bit to the spectacle, especially when there are explosions going off. Speaking of spectacle - it looks just phenomenal for its age. Only human models are somewhat sub-par, but still huge improvement over the original.- There is a metric ton of side content - TV shows, conversations, environmental storytelling, and thankfully you can skip it all very easily.- The tone is entirely different now. MP1 was gritty, its humor was dark. MP2 is still a blood-soaked tragedy, but much lighter and cheesier, shifting from noir to alsmot being kitsch. It is both serious and deconstructive at the same time, hard-hitting the player with tangible drama, and then outright mocking events that predated the sequel - just watch a couple of 'episodes' of♥♥♥♥♥♥Justice on MP2's TVs. MP1 was suffering of both character and player, and MP2 leaves the pain to Payne(see what I did there?). But despite being somewhat bipolar, it delivers the 'feels' when it has the intent to do so.- Bullet time is revamped. It regenerates now and is easier to use. Whether you'll like it or not is up to a personal preference.If you enjoy story-rich third-person shooters this is one of the better ones. Buy it and play it. Just maybe try to buy it elsewhere first.			"

												The Best Max Payne game of the franchise, it improves on the first game in terms of graphics and still gives a compelling story. Be warned that I couldn't run the game on modern discrete GPU, and had to get it working on on-board intel integrated graphics; your mileage may vary of course			"

												So after beating this game I can say that its better than the first in the gameplay aspect , has very improved graphics and Max no longer looks like he has a carrot up his♥♥♥♥♥ Also I really enjoyed the narrative in this. If you liked the first game this is an absolute must play . I can also say that theres been a difficulty change and that this game was made easier and more fast paced but instead they made you fight more enemies at once.Great game!			"

												One of the ultimate examples of third person shootdodging. Gameplay is smooth, fast-flowing, and extremely satisfying. The tone is almost perfect, combining grim and gritty New York noir with plenty of tongue-and-cheek black comedy sprinkled throughout. Writing is top-notch and the characters endearing. Only real complaint is with the length; clocking in at a little under six hours.			"

												The beginning of the game for the players of the original will make you hate the new Payne. He's much more of a sad dramatic man that complains all the time about his past actions. At first the game may seem like a dissapointment, but really the farther you get the better it becomes. You see why he acts like he does and the story really folds it's self with lots of homages to the first game.All in all it was a great game and I would give it a solid 8/10Just remember the begining is the only part that can put you off and stop you from playing, but ignore it and keep playing like I have now, and you will love it.

												All I can say is the original was fantastic and the formula here just made that recipe even better. Especailly when you have Rockstar joining in to Publish it.Remedy, the developers of the original Max Payne title have joined forces with Rockstar Games to create the dark and gritty sequel Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne for PlayStation 2, Xbox and PC. The bullet-time fight sequences that made the first title famous are back, and are more stylish than ever. A revamped physics engine and detailed interactive environments turn slow-motion shootout levels into breathtaking cinematic experiences. Rockstar Games has ensured the production values in this tragic film-noir love story are top notch, complete with movie quality voice acting, motion capture, and roller-coaster storyline.			"

												MAx Payne 2 offers a lot more of the same that was seen in the original. Something about it felt very different however. the bullet time is still there, but I didn't use it all that much for some reason. The story is very tragic and bleak, similar to the original, but without the quasi-happy ending. A solid game, but personal tastes favor the original more.			"

												[9/10] - Max Payne 2 is one of those games that you HAVE to read and try not to miss the important information, otherwise it ruins the story. Don't rush through it. If you like compelling stories in your games, then this is a must. However, play the original first, otherwise most of it won't make any sense. Story aside, there are great improvements to gameplay, graphics, and physics over the first, and is an all around fantastic game that should not be missed. The slow motion elements and storytelling are second to none.			"

												This game features the best narrative I've experienced in any game over the last three decades. It has a very good story line, unpredictable twists, great gloomy quotes and great action. The graphics don't quite hold up today, but it's well worth the asking price. It's the second game I bought at retail (the first being Mortal Kombat 2), at full price, without getting disappointed and I have very high standards.			"

												You would think this game has aged poorly considering that it came out in 2003, but no, it aged surprising well, graphics still holds up. Gunplay is very nice and satisfying. Physics are cool. Story is great, if you're paying attention. But there's only one major problem, and that is, the game is extremely short, you can finish this game in 3 hour. But nonetheless, I can still recommend this game to anyone who likes third person shooter, even if you don't care about it's storyline, you can skip the cutscenes and still have fun, gameplay is so satisfying. In short, don't you die without playing this game.			"

												I probably love Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne as much as the first game in series. To keep it short, everything that was already god-tier, remained as good as possible or is even better. Every encounter with enemies is fun, killing them while using slowmo, or without it, is Max of fun. Characters, story and music stays for very long time in memory. Heck, even after playing it again for the first time in 10+ years I haven't forget many stuff. Maybe after so many time I started to think that story in this game is much darker than in previous one. Comics like always are interesting but for some reason, I really missed style used in first game. But for this little Payne, we got something much more amazing - MONA SAX. How fun it is to play here, to move her beatiful body. Probably one of my first gaming loves that never ended. Many years ago there was also special mod... who played Max Payne 2 back then will know what kind of mod I'm talking about. Wasn't dissapointed when I got my hands on this mod, even tho you could call this The Fall nowadays, I didn't regret anything.There is also this amazing game mode where you fight waves of enemies - I remember how many times I played this together with a friend of mine. To show-off who really is better, who reached the 5th minute for the first time, who managed to kill more enemies (yes, while one was playing the other one was counting dead bodies). Really great times and memories.It's not only nostalgia, Max Payne 2 is really great game. Some people will prefer the first one, some this one, but I really love both of Max Payne games and can't really think which one is better. If you enjoyed the previous one, if you want more, get it and play it. Few difficulty modes, additional game mode and beating each of chapters of game as fast as you can will bring you many hours of fun. I'm sure that there will be time when I will once again play this masterpiece.			"

The graphics are smooth and slick, sound effects are big and beefy, bullet time is more impressive and overall it's a brilliant experience with a more mature, adult feel. The noir effect is put to great use with some briliant dialogue over an immersive story. Gameplay is so easy to pick up and play, although a little tough, and is a must for any shooter fan. Highly recommended.			"

												This game is possibly the greatest game I have ever played. The story pulls you in with the series trademark style of tongue and cheek humor and film-noir grittiness. The gameplay is so much fun despite being fairly difficult. Graphics still hold up even though it came out in 2003. Amazing music and voice acting with James McCaffrey as Max Payne stealing the show. My only complaint with this game is it took me about 7 hours to finish it. Despite that, I not only recommend this game, but also the entire series. If you can, get the Max Payne bundle with Max Payne and Max Payne 2, or just the entire trilogy. I almost forgot to say this, but the ending(which I won't spoil)will make you shed a tear. So what are you doing, just get this masterpiece!			"

												Great game. I thought the story of MP1 was better than this one, but I enjoyed the environments and characters more in MP2, than  I did in the 1st game. Another pro is the game ACTUALLY works on modern OS's (windows 7+). Still plays in windowed mode but you just need to hit 'maximize' on the MP2.exe in your task managerNo game breaking bugs or glitches, except for one small one. **SPOILER ALERT** When you are rescuing Vinnie in the baseball-bat-boy costume, and you two are supposed to jump off the balcony, he gets stuck in the doorway of his own balcony, so with a little persistence you can keep pushing him, slamming the doors open and shut until he eventually falls through the other side.Other than that the game ran flawlessly.
